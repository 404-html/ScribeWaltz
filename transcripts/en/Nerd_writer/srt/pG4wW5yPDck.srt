1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,320
It is 57 degrees in New York City in 
January,

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:05,783
coffee on a Tuesday and blog,
46 in the deep reaches of our universe 

3
00:00:21,061 --> 00:00:24,360
and starless spaces as here in New York 
City.

4
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:29,750
Time passes without impediment like a 
ball rolling smoothly downhill forever.

5
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:31,523
We are,
as humans drawn to extrapolate it 

6
00:00:32,911 --> 00:00:33,744
forward and backward to the coffee we're
meant to get with a friend later this 

7
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,220
afternoon to the siege of Constantinople
in 12.

8
00:00:38,221 --> 00:00:38,820
Oh,
four.

9
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:39,653
To our illustrious future of flying cars
or to the time when you tried to teach 

10
00:00:42,421 --> 00:00:44,280
her sister to cal when she was three

11
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,430
out loud.

12
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,640
Our meditations take us far before and 
far beyond the present moment so far.

13
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:57,120
We feel the gaps like giant,
deep breaths in our hearts.

14
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:02,150
But was there a time when time was.
What I mean to say is,

15
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,180
did time ever begin?
Let's start with the Wilkinson microwave

16
00:01:06,181 --> 00:01:07,014
and a Satrapi probe.
Board w map a measuring device launched 

17
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:14,130
far into the solar system in 2001 to 
take spherical images of the universe at

18
00:01:14,131 --> 00:01:14,964
several different frequencies.
We've observed the first light emitted 

19
00:01:17,671 --> 00:01:20,430
in our universe.
Some 380,000

20
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,353
years after the big bang.
It's called the cosmic microwave 

21
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:25,223
background.
Though we can't see before that we can 

22
00:01:26,881 --> 00:01:27,714
extrapolate using the speed of the 
expanding galaxy backwards to determine 

23
00:01:30,871 --> 00:01:34,680
that the big bang happened around 13 
point 7 billion years ago.

24
00:01:34,681 --> 00:01:35,580
We can,
however,

25
00:01:35,581 --> 00:01:36,414
get to the moment of the Big Bang,
we can only probe with our physics two 

26
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,560
right after to a second,
after to a millisecond after to one unit

27
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:44,603
of plank time,
roughly 10 to the negative 43 seconds 

28
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,110
after the big bang.

29
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:49,973
Many of our brightest believed that the 
moment we can't see the moment of the 

30
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:53,154
big bang is in fact a singularity and 
infinitely hot and infinitely dense 

31
00:01:56,851 --> 00:01:58,290
point,
which when released,

32
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:02,070
created space and time.
Others disagree saying that our universe

33
00:02:02,071 --> 00:02:02,904
is merely one in a series or part of an 
infinite loop of expansion and 

34
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:07,374
contraction,
but are we any closer to conceiving of 

35
00:02:10,141 --> 00:02:12,800
an answer to our question?
As the oed defines it,

36
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,280
time as the indefinite continued 
progress of events in scientific terms,

37
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,293
it's the perpetual transition from low 
entropy to high entropy from a ordered 

38
00:02:22,081 --> 00:02:24,420
state to a confused one.
You can crack an egg,

39
00:02:24,421 --> 00:02:27,990
but you cannot uncrack it.
You can remember the past,

40
00:02:27,991 --> 00:02:28,824
but not the future.
The truth is that the only reason we 

41
00:02:30,661 --> 00:02:32,910
know time is there is because we 
perceive it.

42
00:02:32,911 --> 00:02:33,744
We don't see it.
We see simply causes and effects and 

43
00:02:36,151 --> 00:02:38,780
conclude its presence as St Augustine 
said,

44
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:39,990
what then is time?

45
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:42,480
If no one asks me,
I know what it is.

46
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,970
If I wished to explain it to him who 
asks,

47
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,100
I do not know.
So where are we?

48
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:47,993
Just confused.
Mouthpieces asking absurd questions 

49
00:02:50,431 --> 00:02:52,650
like,
when did time begin?

50
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,170
The question won't even allow itself to 
be asked.

51
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,060
Why?
Why is it unreachable?

52
00:02:57,061 --> 00:02:57,894
Well,
maybe there's an answer in the 

53
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:00,550
beginning.
The Big Bang.

54
00:03:00,551 --> 00:03:04,000
The singularity is essentially a 
discontinuity,

55
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,700
a break in our understanding there 
wasn't,

56
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:08,163
and then there was the concept of 
emergent phenomena is extremely 

57
00:03:11,501 --> 00:03:14,080
important.
It's something that arises as the effect

58
00:03:14,081 --> 00:03:14,914
of complex causes,
but is not analyzable simply as the sum 

59
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:21,610
of their effects.
A great example of emergent phenomena is

60
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:22,623
Darwinian evolution.
The formula that is natural selection 

61
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:27,970
can be arrived at simply by studying the
laws of physics.

62
00:03:27,971 --> 00:03:31,060
Indeed before Darwin.
That's what every biologist tried to do.

63
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,073
It was Darwin's genius to see that the 
rule of evolution emerged from the rule 

64
00:03:35,621 --> 00:03:36,640
of physics,
which is to say,

65
00:03:36,641 --> 00:03:38,620
given the initial conditions of the 
universe,

66
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:43,630
one could not predict the emergence and 
rule of Darwinian evolution on earth.

67
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,650
There is a discontinuity between the two
sets of rules in the same way.

68
00:03:47,651 --> 00:03:48,484
There's a discontinuity between matter 
and light from the particles of matter 

69
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:52,443
emerge,
the organizing principle of life 

70
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:54,903
compatible with matter,
but not analyzable as the sum of its 

71
00:03:57,191 --> 00:03:58,024
effects,
and here is where time comes back into 

72
00:04:00,461 --> 00:04:01,294
the picture.
Matter by its very definition is a 

73
00:04:02,681 --> 00:04:05,560
function of space.
It can move through time,

74
00:04:05,561 --> 00:04:06,394
but taking generally is not effected by 
with the emergence of life space and 

75
00:04:09,521 --> 00:04:10,354
time,
converged life is the evolving 

76
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:12,874
complexity of an organism in every stage
of its evolution corresponds with a 

77
00:04:16,991 --> 00:04:18,910
moment in time and vice versa.
Now,

78
00:04:18,911 --> 00:04:19,744
there's one more emergent phenomena in 
this sequence and it's the most 

79
00:04:22,091 --> 00:04:24,490
important to both us and our discussion 
here.

80
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:28,330
The emergence of the mind.
As life came from matter,

81
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,193
the mind came from life,
from the increasing complexity and 

82
00:04:31,901 --> 00:04:36,100
growth of the brain coupled with of all 
things the vocal cords.

83
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:36,993
It was at the dawn of language probably 
sometime in the last hundred thousand 

84
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:45,060
years when the dual emergence of symbols
and the mind changed everything again,

85
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,053
the use of language to make symbols 
which are just names that change in 

86
00:04:48,971 --> 00:04:52,330
different context allowed for the 
creation of a symbolic reality.

87
00:04:52,331 --> 00:04:54,640
In other words,
everything you see around you,

88
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:55,503
the rule of symbolic reality is again,
compatible with life but not analyzable 

89
00:04:59,681 --> 00:05:01,900
as the sum of its effects.
It's something new.

90
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:02,883
Our minds are something new,
whereas matter is a function of space 

91
00:05:05,981 --> 00:05:08,530
and life is a function of both space and
time.

92
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,573
Our minds,
the human mind is purely a function of 

93
00:05:12,491 --> 00:05:13,420
time.
Think about it.

94
00:05:13,421 --> 00:05:14,254
What is the one evident quality of 
thoughts that they have to happen in 

95
00:05:17,441 --> 00:05:18,274
sequence?
The only way we can tell one idea from 

96
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:22,240
another is by identifying the order in 
which they occur.

97
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,103
This is why it's hard actually 
impossible for us to fully wrap our 

98
00:05:25,841 --> 00:05:30,160
minds around time or to consider a state
in which it doesn't exist.

99
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:35,370
You can't use a ruler to measure the 
absence of space in a very real way.

100
00:05:36,161 --> 00:05:40,060
What we consider to be ourselves is 
composed of time stuff,

101
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:43,090
and it is given to us of all creatures 
to consider,

102
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,350
measure,
conserve,

103
00:05:44,351 --> 00:05:49,351
and extrapolate it as we wish.
We are each of us time superheroes.

104
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:58,443
Wow.
