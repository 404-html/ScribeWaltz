1
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,930
The opening of the helm steep battle 
scene in the two towers reminds me a lot

2
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:19,100
of the opening scene from Sergio Leone 
once upon a time in the west.

3
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,353
Both movies have classic scores,
but both use silence and some spare 

4
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:27,140
foley sound effects.
To set the stage,

5
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:32,120
silence is important because a battle 
like a shootout is all about contract.

6
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,730
Helm's deep is full of contrasts as a 39
minute sequence.

7
00:00:41,731 --> 00:00:46,260
It has to carry the dramatic weight,
the ups and downs of a mini movie within

8
00:00:46,261 --> 00:00:48,450
a movie to hold our attention.
In fact,

9
00:00:48,451 --> 00:00:51,750
since the two towers is essentially the 
middle of a larger story,

10
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:55,770
Peter Jackson and his co writer writers 
needed the battle to be climactic enough

11
00:00:55,771 --> 00:01:00,120
to provide enough temporary closure that
the film could stand on its own.

12
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:01,403
In the end,
it's that necessity which I think 

13
00:01:02,881 --> 00:01:03,714
generated the best cinematic battle of 
the trilogy and one of the best movie 

14
00:01:06,871 --> 00:01:07,704
battles of all time.
You can break the home Steve Battle or 

15
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,393
the battle of the Hornberger,
as it's known in the books into 24 

16
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:14,963
beats.
These beats provide a rough layout for 

17
00:01:17,011 --> 00:01:18,930
the rhythm of the sequence.
By the way,

18
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,630
speaking of contrast,
you can see looking at it this way,

19
00:01:21,631 --> 00:01:24,960
that a large part of the battle is 
virtually monochromatic.

20
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:26,840
The late great cinematographer Andrew 
Lesson,

21
00:01:26,841 --> 00:01:27,674
he had a really difficult task of 
maintaining the feel of a night battle 

22
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:31,824
and the rain while making sure that the 
visuals were intelligible enough to the 

23
00:01:34,531 --> 00:01:35,364
viewer.
He does this by infusing the scene with 

24
00:01:37,141 --> 00:01:40,110
a strong bluish backlight extensively 
the moon,

25
00:01:40,111 --> 00:01:43,980
which draws out edges and by keeping the
color palate very limited,

26
00:01:43,981 --> 00:01:48,390
he ensures that shots aren't too busy 
for the eyes and brains of the audience.

27
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,230
Intelligibility is really important for 
a giant set piece like this.

28
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:55,140
Not only do you want the audience to be 
able to see what's happening,

29
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:59,250
you want them to have a sense of how the
fighting is developing for each side,

30
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:02,730
which is why these 24 narrative beats 
are crucial.

31
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:03,803
Each beat represents an action or 
development that carries an emotional 

32
00:02:07,171 --> 00:02:09,750
cue,
whether it's the feeling of anticipation

33
00:02:09,751 --> 00:02:12,180
at the start or the feeling of 
vulnerability.

34
00:02:12,181 --> 00:02:13,014
When the euro explode,
the deepening wall and March up the 

35
00:02:15,481 --> 00:02:18,480
causeway or the feeling of hope at 
sunrise,

36
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:23,510
and when Gandalf finally arrives,
if you were to graph the progress of the

37
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:24,624
battle using these 24 beats along an 
axis of how close the heroes were to 

38
00:02:28,651 --> 00:02:32,310
victory or defeat,
it would look something like this.

39
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:33,203
What strikes me right away is that this 
shape resembles almost exactly a 

40
00:02:37,351 --> 00:02:41,590
traditional story arc in miniature 
complete with inciting

41
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:42,493
incident,

42
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:46,230
growing obstacles,

43
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,800
mini triumphs,

44
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:10,760
and a roaring Victoria's climax just 
when things are at their most.

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,833
Steve really is a movie within a movie.
It has a fully realized narrative 

46
00:03:19,471 --> 00:03:20,304
structure that that parallels the 
narrative shape of the trilogy where 

47
00:03:23,581 --> 00:03:24,414
things get darker and darker and closer 
to defeat with some small victories 

48
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,570
along the way,
including home steep itself,

49
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:34,170
but only at the very end when all hope 
is lost.

50
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:35,063
Does the climactic triumph occur?
Having a complete narrative arc like 

51
00:03:38,461 --> 00:03:42,300
this is how you keep an audience 
interested in a 39 minute sequence,

52
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,360
but to keep them invested,
you have to do even more.

53
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:49,710
As I said before,
home steep is full of contrasts of close

54
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:50,663
hand,
hand fighting contrast with sweeping 

55
00:03:52,741 --> 00:03:55,230
crane shots,
moments of levity,

56
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:02,160
elvish contrast with moments of tragedy,
darkness contrasts with light,

57
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,153
but with violent,
this reckless hate with moral 

58
00:04:07,561 --> 00:04:08,394
conviction.
One of the contrasts that Lord of the 

59
00:04:10,141 --> 00:04:14,880
rings always has to balance is the one 
between the real and the mythic.

60
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:18,840
The film has to be emotionally realistic
enough to register on a personal level,

61
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:22,530
but it also has to have that extra 
heightened element of fantasy,

62
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,560
of myth as if we're watching something 
more perfect than a true story can be.

63
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:30,570
You see that in color Palette like I 
mentioned,

64
00:04:30,571 --> 00:04:33,920
but also in the rain and smoking other 
atmospherics,

65
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:39,140
the peppered use of slow motion.
Of course there are shots like this.

66
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,310
It's these things that make the scenes 
narrative arc three dimensional,

67
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,540
Peter Jackson,
Andrew,

68
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:46,374
less neat and the crews and actors who 
spent four months of night shoots 

69
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,333
filming the sequence,
not only made it easily comprehensible 

70
00:04:52,891 --> 00:04:53,724
for audiences,
but also resonate with the rest of the 

71
00:04:56,281 --> 00:05:01,281
film on the theme of darkness contrasted
with light that defines the trilogy.

72
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,400
Helm's deep is at once self contained 
and a critical part of something bigger.

73
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,280
In other words,
it's not only a masterful sequence helps

74
00:05:11,281 --> 00:05:14,880
the is the reason why epic battles.

75
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:31,270
