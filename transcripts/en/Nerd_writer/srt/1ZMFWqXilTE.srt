1
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:04,860
Coffee on a Tuesday in blog,
31.

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,000
Ooh,

3
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:12,360
yeah,

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,540
so did you see this new Google video 
floating around?

5
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:22,374
Project glass in which all the 
information that you can access on your 

6
00:00:25,621 --> 00:00:26,454
smartphone is put into these very sleek 
glasses and made a part of your regular 

7
00:00:30,241 --> 00:00:31,350
vision.
That surprised me,

8
00:00:31,351 --> 00:00:34,950
that Google put this ad out because it 
must mean they think that there are more

9
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:37,320
people who would see this and say,
wow,

10
00:00:37,321 --> 00:00:39,000
that's amazing.
I want that.

11
00:00:39,001 --> 00:00:42,510
Then those who would almost reflexively 
be terrified by it.

12
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:47,400
The video was shot in first person so as
to put the viewer in the experience,

13
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:48,293
and I wonder if I was the only one who 
felt a palpable sense of intrusion when 

14
00:00:52,411 --> 00:00:53,244
the first icons launched into the whole 
add functions as a sort of metaphor for 

15
00:00:57,691 --> 00:00:58,524
social media.
Something that is wedging its way into 

16
00:01:00,031 --> 00:01:00,864
our lives and the culture is so 
successfully that we can't help but to 

17
00:01:03,391 --> 00:01:04,860
participate in it with everyone else.

18
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:05,723
This is the effect of all new 
technologies they create needs that you 

19
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:12,000
did not have before needs,
which you can abstain from satisfying or

20
00:01:12,001 --> 00:01:12,834
even recognizing,
but only until they apply to that 

21
00:01:14,551 --> 00:01:15,384
critical mass of people at that point 
not to use the technology actually puts 

22
00:01:18,721 --> 00:01:22,530
you at a disadvantage in communication.
People begin to get angry with you,

23
00:01:22,531 --> 00:01:24,840
right,
and you're all but forced to conform.

24
00:01:24,841 --> 00:01:28,080
Think of cell phones.
You can choose not to have one,

25
00:01:28,081 --> 00:01:31,470
but are you willing to suffer the 
frustration and displeasure of all those

26
00:01:31,471 --> 00:01:33,840
who feel entitled to get in touch with 
you at any time?

27
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:34,883
You can cling to your principles,
but what happens when those principles 

28
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:40,290
come into tension with relationships?
You're not willing to compromise.

29
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,183
You may say you don't want to be friends
with anyone who doesn't respect your 

30
00:01:43,921 --> 00:01:45,600
choice,
not to be plugged in.

31
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:48,120
That might work today with facebook and 
twitter,

32
00:01:48,121 --> 00:01:50,280
but not really anymore with cell phones,
right?

33
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,160
What job today doesn't require you to 
have a cell phone?

34
00:01:53,161 --> 00:01:55,560
What job today doesn't require you to 
have a smartphone?

35
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,590
It's in this way that technology's wedge
themselves into the culture.

36
00:01:58,591 --> 00:02:00,000
Over time.
Individually,

37
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:00,923
you may disagree with the technology,
but you like everyone else has a stake 

38
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:04,913
in culture,
so as far as the culture accepts 

39
00:02:06,931 --> 00:02:07,770
facebook,
twitter,

40
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:08,800
cell phones,
smartphones,

41
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:09,653
et Cetera,
you will have to compromise your values 

42
00:02:11,221 --> 00:02:13,290
to the extent that you want to 
participate in it.

43
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,780
We're all pulled along.
By the way,

44
00:02:15,781 --> 00:02:16,614
the culture.
Maybe tomorrow you decide that you'll 

45
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:18,683
never watch a youtube video again,
but you can't be someone who never 

46
00:02:22,471 --> 00:02:23,304
watched a youtube video,
no doubt it's a terrifying prospect and 

47
00:02:25,591 --> 00:02:26,424
you're not human if you don't feel even 
a little bit overwhelmed by cultural 

48
00:02:29,161 --> 00:02:29,994
changes of this nature and even more 
overwhelmed when you realize that the 

49
00:02:32,161 --> 00:02:36,510
changes are coming at an accelerating 
rate and devices like the Google glasses

50
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:40,260
will be ubiquitous,
not tomorrow or next year,

51
00:02:40,261 --> 00:02:42,090
but in a relatively short time.

52
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:46,080
You begin to wonder who decides what 
comes next.

53
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:46,943
In the postwar fifties and sixties,
manufacturers created dozens and dozens 

54
00:02:50,071 --> 00:02:53,250
of new appliances for the growing number
of middle class homes,

55
00:02:53,251 --> 00:02:55,290
appliances that they perhaps didn't 
need,

56
00:02:55,291 --> 00:03:00,291
but a capitalist economy is structured 
toward growth toward corporations needed

57
00:03:00,521 --> 00:03:03,430
to build and create new products for 
consumption.

58
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,790
You see the same trend today in 
technology and social media.

59
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:06,643
The differences that in the past it was 
physical products that you could put 

60
00:03:09,851 --> 00:03:14,851
somewhere the advances in upgrades in 
tech instead have the effect of small,

61
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:15,843
gradual,
unsolicited alterations to our 

62
00:03:17,621 --> 00:03:18,454
personalities and that's weird.
There's a lot of literature out there 

63
00:03:20,831 --> 00:03:25,150
already on the way the Internet age is 
affecting our minds and social behavior.

64
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:29,260
Many say that it's a boon connecting us 
to more people and more information.

65
00:03:29,261 --> 00:03:30,094
Others say that social media only gives 
the illusion of being more connected 

66
00:03:33,731 --> 00:03:36,040
when in fact we are more separated and 
alone.

67
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:38,260
There is truth to both.
I'm sure,

68
00:03:38,261 --> 00:03:41,140
and this is only the first chapter in a 
long story,

69
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:45,520
but this weekend I had the pleasure to 
take a trip to the beautiful desert east

70
00:03:45,521 --> 00:03:46,354
of Los Angeles and sitting there among 
the sparse vegetation decompressing 

71
00:03:50,351 --> 00:03:51,184
after 30 weeks of Lugs,
I had the feeling that social media 

72
00:03:54,731 --> 00:03:55,564
doesn't so much corrupt.
Our ability to be social as it does our 

73
00:03:58,541 --> 00:03:59,374
ability to be alone,
to savor that much needed solitude and 

74
00:04:03,761 --> 00:04:04,594
silence in which so many things are 
reconciled and put in their proper 

75
00:04:07,841 --> 00:04:08,674
place.
And maybe it's this condition of 

76
00:04:11,141 --> 00:04:14,020
perpetual half measures,
half alone,

77
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:14,883
half together,
all the time that we should be most 

78
00:04:17,501 --> 00:04:20,110
careful to guard against,
if not for the culture at large.

79
00:04:20,111 --> 00:04:20,944
Then at least for ourselves,
from the first and biggest drop off the 

80
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:26,014
top of the jar.

81
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:34,700
So far,
happy faces at all times.

82
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,810
Peter Pan,
peanut butter on.
