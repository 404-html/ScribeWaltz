1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,700
Have you ever bought something nice for 
your apartment or your room,

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,830
brought it home,
put it in place,

3
00:00:07,831 --> 00:00:10,200
and had the thought,
Jesus,

4
00:00:10,201 --> 00:00:11,034
my apartment is a piece of shit,
or maybe you bought a new shirt and 

5
00:00:14,551 --> 00:00:16,560
suddenly you're grabbing for it all the 
time,

6
00:00:16,561 --> 00:00:19,890
waiting for that day in the rotation 
when you can wear it again,

7
00:00:19,891 --> 00:00:20,724
tired of everything you already own.
The name for this social consumer's 

8
00:00:24,241 --> 00:00:26,820
phenomenon is called the [inaudible] 
effect,

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,190
and it works on two principles.
First step,

10
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,053
all the products purchased by a consumer
aim to be cohesive with that consumer's 

11
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,470
identity with all the products that they
already owned.

12
00:00:37,471 --> 00:00:39,630
Second,
that the introduction of a new product,

13
00:00:39,631 --> 00:00:44,040
which is desirable button anyway,
deviant from the existing cohesion,

14
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,790
can trigger a process of spiraling 
consumption.

15
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:48,653
In other words,
as much as we decry the dangers of a 

16
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:55,050
materialist society,
the things we own comprise a significant

17
00:00:55,051 --> 00:00:56,340
part of who we are.

18
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,233
Our identities are tied up in our 
clothes and our gadgets and the way of 

19
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:02,694
our furniture more than anything else.
We try to find a unity in our 

20
00:01:06,091 --> 00:01:06,924
possessions and by extension,
try to convince ourselves that our 

21
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:10,194
identity itself is uniform.
The effect was first identified by its 

22
00:01:13,441 --> 00:01:14,274
namesake.
French philosopher Denny Dita wrote in 

23
00:01:16,471 --> 00:01:20,610
an essay called regrets on potting with 
my own dressing gown.

24
00:01:20,611 --> 00:01:22,290
I don't know why I did an English accent
there.

25
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:23,124
He's French in the sad truth is given a 
brand new scarlet dressing gown to 

26
00:01:26,821 --> 00:01:27,654
replace his worn out one,
but soon laments that the luxury of his 

27
00:01:31,051 --> 00:01:33,750
new item shames all his other 
possessions,

28
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:34,763
so he goes on a rampage and replaces 
everything he owns with beautiful new 

29
00:01:38,191 --> 00:01:39,024
things.
Eventually putting himself in serious 

30
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,473
debt.
I was the absolute master of my old 

31
00:01:44,641 --> 00:01:45,510
robe.
He says,

32
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,450
I have become the slave of my new one.

33
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:52,320
The effect is at the core of the 
materialist ethos,

34
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,000
prodded by that familiar yearning of 
keeping up with the Joneses to fit in or

35
00:01:57,001 --> 00:01:59,460
even outclass those around us and in the
media.

36
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:04,810
We are not capable of stopping at simply
upgrading or updating one corner of what

37
00:02:05,671 --> 00:02:06,504
we own.
We grabbed fee virtually at a better 

38
00:02:08,581 --> 00:02:13,080
kind of unity even at the expense of our
financial wellbeing.

39
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:15,720
This poses a problem for companies that 
produce goods.

40
00:02:15,721 --> 00:02:20,721
It's why stuff usually comes in sets and
those sets usually at a discount.

41
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:24,470
It's why Ikea showcases full rooms in 
there.

42
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:28,710
Disney Disneyland,
like tour of the kinds of people you can

43
00:02:28,711 --> 00:02:29,544
be.
Can we be blamed for this materialist 

44
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,660
craving in us?
Well,

45
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:36,750
the answer is definitely yes,
but a soft yes,

46
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,550
a soft yes for we who are pampered rats 
within the capitalist construct,

47
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,400
modern men and women laboring as rust.

48
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,400
Cole says an illusion of having a 
cohesive uniform identity.

49
00:02:49,591 --> 00:02:53,580
It seems to us might be some solve 
against the chaotic truth.

50
00:02:53,581 --> 00:02:58,581
That reality is as fractious and self 
constructed as we are one day we'll have

51
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:03,010
to strike out against this insane 
consumerism.

52
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:04,443
Until then,
the Ikea spring living room set is as 

53
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,720
good as crack.
Hey everybody.

54
00:03:10,721 --> 00:03:11,554
Thanks for watching.
The [inaudible] effect is a really 

55
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:16,330
interesting social phenomenon tied in 
with a lot of other things.

56
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,810
You can read more about it in the links 
that I'll put in the description below.

57
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,540
All companies that make goods and 
services deal with this problem.

58
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:24,490
The environmentalist movement,
for example,

59
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:25,750
is no exception.
Green,

60
00:03:25,751 --> 00:03:28,660
good producers and cis not on buying 
their stuff,

61
00:03:28,661 --> 00:03:33,490
but on replacing the harmful things that
you already follow me on twitter.

62
00:03:33,491 --> 00:03:37,810
I love to tweet and try to make people 
think or laugh or smile or whatever.

63
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:39,420
I just think it's an awesome platform.
Um,

64
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:40,443
and uh,
I'm going to put this video on reddit 

65
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:42,663
and hopefully it gets some traction.
I'll put the link there when I do an 

66
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:46,530
upload it.
If you enjoyed this video read,

67
00:03:46,531 --> 00:03:51,531
it's been awesome in spreading the stuff
that I make and I'll see you next week.
