1
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:19,780
Coffee on a Tuesday in block 34.
Uh,

2
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:34,940
so you're annoyed with me?
Yes.

3
00:00:34,941 --> 00:00:38,600
I did drop out of the university there 
for a few months with no explanation,

4
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:44,910
but I can explain it in 2010.
I graduated from college as a film major

5
00:00:46,601 --> 00:00:47,434
and I was sure sure then that I was 
going to be a filmmaker for the rest of 

6
00:00:51,101 --> 00:00:51,934
my life that summer I made a film called
I met you once in a dream and I thought 

7
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:57,370
then it was gonna be the next in the 
line of,

8
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,020
you know,
hundreds of movies,

9
00:00:59,021 --> 00:01:01,720
but that did work out in the next few 
months.

10
00:01:01,721 --> 00:01:05,500
I read a lot of philosophy and wrote my 
discourse on truth before leaving Boston

11
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,530
with three friends to take a u shaped 
road trip across the country.

12
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,330
And a blue Hyundai Tucson.
Oh,

13
00:01:10,331 --> 00:01:11,950
I miss that car.
I moved to Portland,

14
00:01:11,951 --> 00:01:14,890
Oregon with small teeny tiny crisis of 
purpose.

15
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,470
Worked on a farm for a little while and 
came out the other end.

16
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,640
A novel.
I grew a beard.

17
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:20,220
Oh,
I missed that beard.

18
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:22,600
I wrote my first book,
Big City,

19
00:01:22,601 --> 00:01:27,490
which you can still buy on gumroad.com,
and I left Portland when everyone I knew

20
00:01:27,491 --> 00:01:28,270
left it to that.

21
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:29,103
I was in la for a little while before 
moving to Paris where I wrote my second 

22
00:01:31,661 --> 00:01:32,860
book,
all languages,

23
00:01:32,861 --> 00:01:36,220
the rose,
which is either dying or dead and when I

24
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:40,260
came back to the states I moved back to 
La and try to figure out how to public.

25
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:43,120
One day when I got lost in a youtube 
wormhole,

26
00:01:43,121 --> 00:01:43,954
I happened to discover the Vlog brothers
and I thought the videos were pretty 

27
00:01:46,751 --> 00:01:47,584
fucking cool.
I figured out that John Green was a 

28
00:01:48,731 --> 00:01:49,564
novelist and he was selling out 
printings because of his subscribers on 

29
00:01:51,821 --> 00:01:52,820
youtube and I thought,
you know,

30
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,190
I can do that.
So I did.

31
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:57,940
I started making videos every week with 
an eye towards publishing my books,

32
00:01:57,941 --> 00:02:01,630
but after awhile I just started to want 
to make good content for its own sake.

33
00:02:01,631 --> 00:02:02,464
I really liked this youtube thing.
One day I was in a cafe and I had this 

34
00:02:05,681 --> 00:02:06,514
idea for a video for the project for 
awesome on the kind fund charity for 

35
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:10,803
getting kids desks in Malawi,
which was actually created by the last 

36
00:02:14,171 --> 00:02:16,330
word with Lawrence O'donnell on MSNBC.

37
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,193
The video sort of blew up and they heard
about it and then they had me on the 

38
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:21,570
show.
The night after I was on Lauren's email,

39
00:02:21,571 --> 00:02:23,290
ben asked me if I wanted to go out for 
coffee,

40
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:25,090
so I said yes,
yes,

41
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:26,343
yes.
He said you should move to New York and 

42
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:27,874
do this video stuff for us and since I 
was broke and since I was working as a 

43
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:33,480
telemarketer,
which was crushing my soul into tiny,

44
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,840
teeny,
tiny little bits of sharks,

45
00:02:35,841 --> 00:02:36,674
a tiny,
tiny little pieces of glass that were 

46
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:41,290
cutting me from the inside and since I 
was broke and this was basically a dream

47
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:42,370
job,
I accepted.

48
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:43,204
It.
Took a long time to work out the 

49
00:02:43,721 --> 00:02:46,240
particulars and then working them out 
and I disappeared from this blog,

50
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:50,710
moved to New York City,
sort of working at 30 rock for MSNBC.

51
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:51,783
Doing this video stuff would.
You can sometimes find here and here 

52
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,370
links in the way and now that I've 
finally settled in,

53
00:02:57,371 --> 00:03:00,430
I sort of want to kind of come back.
Can I come back.
