Hello and welcome to my second video.
This has been pushed back and I'm a 

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:08,180
blogger now.
The reason I'm doing another one,

3
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:17,350
actually it's because I had an idea.
Here's my thinking.

4
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:21,490
I'm a nerdfighter and a writer under 
fighting writer,

5
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:24,010
a nerd writer watch.

6
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:27,853
That's almost a w.
So I am going to answer the Youtube 

7
00:00:29,511 --> 00:00:30,344
survey,
but first I wanted to say 

8
00:00:31,311 --> 00:00:33,860
congratulations to Maureen Johnson and 
the name of the star.

9
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:36,170
It's fantastic to get published.
Regulations.

10
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:37,940
Boring.
I'm going to find your book and buy it.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,500
Well,
my first kiss was in a tree house when I

12
00:00:39,501 --> 00:00:41,270
was nine years old.
I was playing truth or dare with a bunch

13
00:00:41,271 --> 00:00:42,104
of people and someone dared,
a girl named Erica to kiss me and she 

14
00:00:44,361 --> 00:00:47,360
did and that was my first kiss and I 
couldn't fucking believe it.

15
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:48,440
Casual clothing,
I don't know.

16
00:00:48,441 --> 00:00:51,440
Everything I wear is pretty casual.
I get most of it from the gap,

17
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,020
so probably $60,
99.

18
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,320
Really?
I didn't know what I wanted to be when I

19
00:00:54,321 --> 00:00:55,154
was a kid.
I was always told that it would be an 

20
00:00:55,641 --> 00:00:56,690
engineer.
Like my dad.

21
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:58,880
I was always good at science and math,
but I never liked him.

22
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,713
I liked history and literature.
Eventually I decided I wanted to be a 

23
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:03,740
filmmaker.
By that time I was already 17 years old.

24
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:04,603
Does that count?
I'm really glad you asked about school 

25
00:01:05,361 --> 00:01:07,190
friends because these are the most 
important people in my life.

26
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,990
I'm a writer so I really could be 
anywhere in the world,

27
00:01:08,991 --> 00:01:11,840
but I choose to be in Los Angeles 
because my friends are here.

28
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:12,853
That's the reason.
It's the only thing in my life that I 

29
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,013
built that I think is worth preserving.
Friendship is certainly something that 

30
00:01:17,601 --> 00:01:19,250
you built over time.
It's work.

31
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,200
I love these guys and girls and if they 
weren't Siberia,

32
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:23,360
that's right.
Beat by the girl George.

33
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:26,840
If I had a guy orpheus that will always 
push and push,

34
00:01:26,841 --> 00:01:30,140
that would be a good name to zillow.
500 to answer the survey next,

35
00:01:30,141 --> 00:01:33,050
but he's my only subscribers so far.
I love Ucla.

36
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:34,130
Thank you so much.
