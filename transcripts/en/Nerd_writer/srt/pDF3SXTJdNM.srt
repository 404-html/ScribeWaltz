1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,890
This might be a silly question,
but what do you do with a beached whale?

2
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:07,783
That's a question.
The small Canadian town of Trout River 

3
00:00:10,401 --> 00:00:15,200
is trying to figure out right now,
an 81 foot beast of a whale washed up on

4
00:00:15,201 --> 00:00:19,010
one of his rocky beaches last week as 
food and it's humongous.

5
00:00:19,011 --> 00:00:19,844
Stomach begins to rot and decompose.
Bacteria proliferates and that bacteria 

6
00:00:24,321 --> 00:00:25,154
in turn begins to feed on the whales.
Inerts microbes called anaerobic 

7
00:00:29,481 --> 00:00:30,314
mythology and start to break down 
molecules and release methane gas into 

8
00:00:33,891 --> 00:00:37,490
the sealed environment,
billowing that fucker up like a birthday

9
00:00:37,491 --> 00:00:41,690
party balloon wait too long and the 
whale might explode.

10
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:44,360
It's a cool concept,
but you don't really want that if you're

11
00:00:44,361 --> 00:00:45,194
trout river bringing and unassuming 
gentleman to sort of poke it with a 

12
00:00:48,021 --> 00:00:50,270
stick and you're going to get the same 
results.

13
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,990
So what do you do?
Well,

14
00:00:53,991 --> 00:00:55,940
you really have two options.

15
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:56,773
You can either airlift the dead whale 
back into the ocean so that its carcass 

16
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:04,820
can feed an entire ecosystem of life for
decades.

17
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:07,340
Side note,
Radiolab has an awesome animation of how

18
00:01:07,341 --> 00:01:08,174
this process works and you can find that
link in the description or you can bury 

19
00:01:12,081 --> 00:01:12,914
the whale somewhere on land.
Both options are going to be really 

20
00:01:15,891 --> 00:01:19,310
expensive and that's public money,
Aka tax money,

21
00:01:19,311 --> 00:01:21,890
Aka your mind,
but if you do nothing,

22
00:01:21,891 --> 00:01:26,190
the methane gas along with the ammonia 
and hydrogen sulfide are gonna.

23
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:29,500
Get really smelly really fast.
Side note,

24
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:30,343
ammonia is the one that smells like cat 
piss and hydrogen sulfide is the one 

25
00:01:33,231 --> 00:01:37,190
that smells like rotten eggs and is the 
part one.

26
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:38,053
You're gonna have to do something.
Trout River and and before you say 

27
00:01:40,821 --> 00:01:43,820
anything,
because I can see the look in your eyes,

28
00:01:43,821 --> 00:01:44,654
don't think about blowing it up.
I mean we tried that already in in 

29
00:01:48,651 --> 00:01:49,940
Portland,
Oregon in 1970

30
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:52,840
that had to be fed.
The Oregon State Highway Division.

31
00:01:52,841 --> 00:01:55,380
Not all had a whale of a problem on a 
tab.

32
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,093
Those thudding noises that you hear,
that's thousands of pieces of whale 

33
00:02:10,761 --> 00:02:11,594
carcass showering.
Unsuspecting passers by and what I'm 

34
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:19,301
sure still remains the most traumatic 
experience of their lives.

35
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:20,773
Art Car over a quarter of a mile from 
the black fight was the target of one 

36
00:02:23,481 --> 00:02:24,314
large chunk.
The passenger compartment literally 

37
00:02:26,211 --> 00:02:29,360
smack.
Fortunately no human was hit as badly as

38
00:02:29,361 --> 00:02:30,194
the car over.
Everyone on the scene was covered with 

39
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,510
small particles of dead.

40
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:37,250
It just goes to show you can't blow up 
all your problems.

41
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:41,450
Sometimes you have to hunker down and 
invent the portal gun.

42
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,810
Are we,
are we working on this?

43
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:49,690
Fucking him.
You may have noticed that sometimes I'll

44
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:50,683
disappear for a few weeks or months 
without any message of where I've gone 

45
00:02:53,481 --> 00:02:56,090
and I'm sorry about that,
but I don't know if you're like this,

46
00:02:56,091 --> 00:03:00,130
but I can't seem to stop jumping to 
different projects.

47
00:03:00,131 --> 00:03:03,040
Like I did this sketch comedy channel 
called Dick Soap,

48
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:05,890
which you can check out or the 
electronic app,

49
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,550
a new disguises which you listened to on
spotify,

50
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:13,210
but I'm back for the nerd writer for a 
little bit.

51
00:03:13,211 --> 00:03:15,650
Hopefully I'm going to try to separate 
it into like season,

52
00:03:15,651 --> 00:03:17,630
so six or 10 episodes.
Um,

53
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,570
and hopefully this is the beginning of a
stretch.

54
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,120
So thanks for sticking with me.
Uh,

55
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,760
and I will see you next time.
