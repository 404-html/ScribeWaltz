1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,060
Copy on a Tuesday.
Wait,

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:03,880
who are you?
I'm waiting for winter.

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,210
I know who you are.
What are you doing in my video?

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:08,543
My video.
This is clearly every week and you're 

5
00:00:11,581 --> 00:00:12,414
infringing upon it.
If you don't remove yourself at one 

6
00:00:13,771 --> 00:00:15,760
point I will be forced to call youtube 
security.

7
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:20,700
Don't don't cut that out.
They have me on hold.

8
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:21,893
Me Too.

9
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,450
I don't want.

10
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,750
Here's a phenomenon you might be 
familiar with to demonstrate.

11
00:00:44,751 --> 00:00:46,670
I'm going to enlist the help of Craig 
Benzie.

12
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:47,533
Otherwise known as.

13
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,713
That's great.
Sitting at his desk editing one of his 

14
00:00:52,501 --> 00:00:53,550
videos.
It's late.

15
00:00:53,551 --> 00:00:54,384
He's getting tired.
Anything's another cup of coffee is in 

16
00:00:56,071 --> 00:00:56,700
order,
so he.

17
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,250
He goes into the kitchen,
pours himself a cup and realizes that he

18
00:00:59,251 --> 00:01:01,560
has to go into the time machine room 
because he needs to get the.

19
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:04,050
Wait a second.
What did he need?

20
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,393
He can't seem to remember.
The first impulse is to go back to the 

21
00:01:07,321 --> 00:01:09,300
kitchen.
Stand by the coffee machine that Oh yes,

22
00:01:09,301 --> 00:01:09,691
yes,
yes.

23
00:01:09,691 --> 00:01:10,524
Now we remember he needed the.
I'm sure you've all had this experience 

24
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:14,874
before,
the experience of arriving somewhere 

25
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:19,140
only to realize that you've forgotten 
what you went through to do.

26
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:20,580
Why does this happen?
Well,

27
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:22,820
last year,
neurological researchers from Notre Dame

28
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:26,430
published an article called why walking 
through doorways causes,

29
00:01:26,431 --> 00:01:28,140
forget it's a.
it's a good title,

30
00:01:28,141 --> 00:01:28,974
and their thesis is that at all times 
our brains are operating within 

31
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:36,570
something called an event model,
a collection of memories relevant to the

32
00:01:36,571 --> 00:01:37,404
current activity,
walking through a doorway can 

33
00:01:39,181 --> 00:01:40,014
unintentionally purge this model because
whatever was happening in the old room 

34
00:01:43,081 --> 00:01:44,400
is less likely to be relevant.

35
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:45,383
Now that you've changed venues,
brains do this to us well because 

36
00:01:48,811 --> 00:01:50,790
normally event models operate 
beautifully.

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,500
It would be impossible to keep all of 
our memories at the fore of our mind,

38
00:01:54,501 --> 00:01:55,334
so our brain's employee,
this incredible mechanism to keep all 

39
00:01:57,541 --> 00:01:58,374
the relevant memories within reach and 
event modeled as being built in your 

40
00:02:02,101 --> 00:02:05,490
brain right now.
Yes,

41
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,530
but I'd like to make a larger point here
if I met you.

42
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,000
See,
this whole business with the vent models

43
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:11,843
gives us a great universally 
recognizable example of the fact that 

44
00:02:14,011 --> 00:02:18,000
our brains are busy every moment with 
activities of which were not aware.

45
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:19,043
In fact,
before we are aware of any one thing 

46
00:02:19,831 --> 00:02:20,664
that we do,
there are a series of neurological 

47
00:02:21,811 --> 00:02:22,644
activities proceeding it.
Benjamin Libet of pioneering scientists 

48
00:02:25,201 --> 00:02:26,034
in the field of human consciousness 
famously proved that activity in the 

49
00:02:28,171 --> 00:02:29,004
brain can be measured some 300 
milliseconds before the person feels 

50
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,980
that he has decided to move today with 
the use of Mri.

51
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:38,010
That estimate has been extended to 
something like six seconds.

52
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:38,873
How should this be extrapolated in 
regard to a concept we all know as 

53
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,690
freewill freewill is at the basis of 
nearly all our belief systems,

54
00:02:45,691 --> 00:02:48,570
it founds not only moral considerations,
but legal ones.

55
00:02:48,571 --> 00:02:49,404
The concepts of incarceration in 
retribution are bound up with 

56
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:55,290
responsibility which is bound up with 
free choice,

57
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:59,980
but as we've seen our choices proceed 
from neural activity of which we are,

58
00:02:59,981 --> 00:03:01,390
again,
not aware,

59
00:03:01,391 --> 00:03:04,840
so does does this mean for example,
that a murderer complete the defense?

60
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:08,440
My brain made me do it.
Einstein didn't believe in freewill yet,

61
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,720
he still believed that murderer should 
be put in jail.

62
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:11,890
Why?
Well,

63
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:12,723
because they're dangerous.
The fact that neural activity proceeds 

64
00:03:15,971 --> 00:03:16,804
and determines our choices doesn't mean 
that the murderer can separate the part 

65
00:03:19,481 --> 00:03:22,480
of himself which is responsible for the 
act of murder.

66
00:03:22,481 --> 00:03:24,310
We are choosing all the time.

67
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:28,120
We can't help it even with the knowledge
that we can't choose what we choose.

68
00:03:28,121 --> 00:03:28,954
We can't stop choosing.
You can sit there and do nothing but 

69
00:03:31,601 --> 00:03:34,870
doing nothing is itself a choice and one
that gets harder with every second.

70
00:03:34,871 --> 00:03:35,704
Eventually you'll decide that this 
business of doing nothing is a waste of 

71
00:03:37,871 --> 00:03:38,704
your time and you'll choose to get up.
So maybe we should imagine our 

72
00:03:43,661 --> 00:03:48,460
consciousness as something like a river 
choice exists as a part of that river,

73
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:49,294
but some ways downstream from the source
and farther downstream from the choice 

74
00:03:52,421 --> 00:03:56,680
is the action and the action has real 
consequences in the world around you and

75
00:03:56,681 --> 00:03:57,514
those consequences.
To the extent that you're around a 

76
00:03:59,181 --> 00:04:01,390
witness them have an effect on the river
as a whole.

77
00:04:01,391 --> 00:04:02,224
See that the mysterious source of the 
river for the most part is not acting 

78
00:04:05,651 --> 00:04:06,484
against you.
It's not an external consciousness and 

79
00:04:08,411 --> 00:04:10,090
it's not a random decision generator.

80
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,870
It acts in harmony with your beliefs and
ideals,

81
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:14,733
with what makes you happy and sad and 
it's informed by the consequences of 

82
00:04:17,921 --> 00:04:18,754
your choices and by the choices of those
around you and by the environment in 

83
00:04:21,281 --> 00:04:25,120
which you live and grow.
There is an experiential disconnect here

84
00:04:25,121 --> 00:04:27,970
which is hard to overcome.
When you look back over your day,

85
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,080
your month,
your life,

86
00:04:29,081 --> 00:04:31,810
you feel as if you were the author of 
your choices,

87
00:04:31,811 --> 00:04:35,610
you feel as if you chose this road as 
opposed to that road and that over time,

88
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,633
this free decider,
what you call I has built its own 

89
00:04:39,161 --> 00:04:39,994
identity.
The problem is that this is impossible 

90
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:42,814
to reconcile with the fact that at every
moment of your life you're being 

91
00:04:46,061 --> 00:04:49,670
informed by unconscious processes like 
say event models.

92
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,460
Free will is an illusion.
It's difficult to accept.

93
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:55,294
It's difficult for me to accept that my 
consciousness is telling me a story 

94
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:00,010
about myself,
which isn't true,

95
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,263
but I can know it despite my feelings 
and I can remind myself of it when I 

96
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:10,171
take myself too seriously or I'm too 
hard on myself for mistakes and maybe in

97
00:05:10,241 --> 00:05:12,160
endeavoring to understand this part of 
me,

98
00:05:12,161 --> 00:05:16,420
I can become more empathetic toward 
those who like me,

99
00:05:16,421 --> 00:05:17,254
like all of us try so desperately hard 
to control their lives and trip up in 

100
00:05:21,461 --> 00:05:23,710
the most spectacular ways.

101
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:30,380
Yes.
I remember what I was supposed to do,

102
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,573
what I have to save the world from this 
nuclear explosion by setting the time 

103
00:05:34,371 --> 00:05:35,204
machine.

104
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,760
Oh Wow.
