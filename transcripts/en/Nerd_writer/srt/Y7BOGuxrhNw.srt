1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,360
Coffee on a Friday and the project for 
awesome.

2
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:14,930
This is the earth.

3
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,420
It goes around the sun.
This is what it looks like up close.

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,140
This is America.
This is Los Angeles.

5
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:26,270
This is a school.
This is a classroom.

6
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:30,260
These are desks.
Here are some American children.

7
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:32,360
Here they are in class.
Here is there a teacher.

8
00:00:32,361 --> 00:00:36,350
Here is one student being told that the 
earth goes around the sun.

9
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:39,890
Here he is being told that there are 300
billion stars in the galaxy.

10
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:40,843
Here he is being told at one thimble 
full of a neutron star would weigh over 

11
00:00:43,431 --> 00:00:45,470
$100,
million tons.

12
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,730
Here he is getting into mit.
Urias graduating magna cum louder.

13
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,113
Here he is.
Unraveling the mysteries of quantum 

14
00:00:51,111 --> 00:00:54,290
entanglement and understanding the key 
to help plants collect,

15
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:57,860
store and use energy from the sun at 100
percent.

16
00:00:57,861 --> 00:00:58,694
Efficiency here are super efficient.
Photo voltaic solar cells that his 

17
00:01:02,301 --> 00:01:05,000
physics helped to create.
Here they are powering the city.

18
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:06,710
Here they are powering a nation.

19
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:10,640
Here's the boy receiving the Nobel 
prize.

20
00:01:10,641 --> 00:01:12,710
Here he is on a Sunday afternoon with 
his family.

21
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:15,680
Here he is thinking back over his life 
about how everything he's done,

22
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:16,783
everything he is he owes to that first 
science teacher who told him about the 

23
00:01:19,911 --> 00:01:20,744
earth and how it goes around the sun,
but the boy who is now an old man 

24
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,900
wouldn't be wrong.
He's forgetting something,

25
00:01:26,901 --> 00:01:27,734
something he would never think of.
Something that predicated the Nobel 

26
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,280
prize in the solar cells and the physics
and mit and his excitement that day,

27
00:01:34,281 --> 00:01:37,100
all those years ago about a thimble full
of neutron star.

28
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:43,330
Boy is forgetting the desks.
This is the earth again.

29
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:44,803
This is Africa.
This is a country in Africa called 

30
00:01:46,821 --> 00:01:48,260
Malawi.
This is a school.

31
00:01:48,261 --> 00:01:51,050
This is a classroom.
There are no desks.

32
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:52,093
Here are some children in pain from 
sitting on the dirt floor for eight 

33
00:01:54,411 --> 00:01:58,190
hours a day and here is one being told 
that the earth goes around the sun.

34
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:00,770
Here is where I tell you that learning 
is like a mountain.

35
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,680
It's hard at first to climb harder for 
some,

36
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,993
but once you reach the peak and become 
self perpetuating and fun and 

37
00:02:07,131 --> 00:02:10,370
transformative on and on for the rest of
your life,

38
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,650
here is how much it would cost to get 
that boy a desk.

39
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:15,290
Here is how much it would cost to get 
the whole classroom desks.

40
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,860
Here is how much you have to donate.
Here are what the desks look like.

41
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,110
Here are how many children the desks can
see.

42
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,910
Here are how many children usually sit 
at one.

43
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:26,930
Here are how many children will sit at 
your desk in its lifetime.

44
00:02:26,931 --> 00:02:30,470
Here is the limit of what someone can do
when they love to learn.

45
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:31,693
Here is my charity.
Here is where you can read more about 

46
00:02:34,551 --> 00:02:37,850
it.
Here is where you can do it.
