1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,060
Yeah,

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:06,553
how do you change an entire industry for
Jeff Bezos and his new grocery store of 

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,920
the future?
Amazon go.

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,950
It's a three part process in no 
particular order.

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,730
Part one,
make a video with over 7 million views.

6
00:00:19,731 --> 00:00:22,970
Amazon's youtube video is a bit of 
Utopian science fiction,

7
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:23,863
a vision for what the future of grocery 
shopping could look like and almost 

8
00:00:26,841 --> 00:00:31,250
completely frictionless consumer 
experience in which you walk in,

9
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:32,173
grab what you want and go.
The marketing here is extremely 

10
00:00:34,821 --> 00:00:35,571
important.
I think.

11
00:00:35,571 --> 00:00:36,404
Notice that Amazon drop this video like 
beyonce drops a surprise album and they 

12
00:00:40,101 --> 00:00:40,934
made sure to disable the comments and 
declined to take questions about the 

13
00:00:43,881 --> 00:00:45,890
concept from journalists for the time 
being.

14
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:49,970
I think the point is to let the idea 
gestate in the public's mind,

15
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,193
letting us internalize the ease and 
stress free environment of our future 

16
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:58,310
grocery stores.
This internalization that hope goes will

17
00:00:58,311 --> 00:00:59,144
flower into an expectation and 
expectation is a very powerful force 

18
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:05,180
that can move markets.

19
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:06,043
This potential for change is crucial for
the second important thing part to get 

20
00:01:10,011 --> 00:01:10,844
the patents in 2013 and 2014.
Amazon filed two patents that describe 

21
00:01:15,351 --> 00:01:19,730
most of the advanced technology we're 
seeing inside the Amazon go store.

22
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,593
The first call detecting item 
interaction and movement describes a 

23
00:01:22,911 --> 00:01:27,410
system for tracking removal or placement
of items at inventory locations,

24
00:01:27,411 --> 00:01:28,244
just like you saw on the video using a 
variety of sensors and cameras with 

25
00:01:31,251 --> 00:01:32,084
object recognition software.
The second expands on this concept 

26
00:01:34,971 --> 00:01:38,330
covering the payment of items when you 
leave a designated area.

27
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:39,493
Now,
both these patents were filed primarily 

28
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:42,134
for use in Amazon's warehouses,
but even then they were putting in 

29
00:01:45,891 --> 00:01:48,480
little hints about their longer term 
goals.

30
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,810
I think I don't see what you're doing.
What are we doing?

31
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,073
Part prove that once Amazon creates the 
expectation for a customer experience 

32
00:01:59,721 --> 00:02:00,554
defined by technology that they own,
the logical thing to do would be to 

33
00:02:03,981 --> 00:02:06,410
start building the Amazon go stores.

34
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:07,603
You're likely to see Amazon start doing 
that once they fix all the bugs with 

35
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,263
their Beta location in Seattle,
but I think this obscures the much 

36
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:18,320
bigger fish that Amazon is trying to 
catch here.

37
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:19,663
To understand what I'm talking about,
you have to look at another part of 

38
00:02:21,501 --> 00:02:25,280
Amazon's business,
Amazon web services.

39
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,413
The massive cloud computing Juggernaut 
that as of 2016 is the most profitable 

40
00:02:30,531 --> 00:02:34,100
segment of Amazon's entire business.
Basically years ago,

41
00:02:34,101 --> 00:02:34,934
Amazon built an online infrastructure to
host and organize its own site and then 

42
00:02:39,111 --> 00:02:39,944
they realized that they could take this 
technology and license it to other 

43
00:02:43,401 --> 00:02:48,080
companies from this.
Amazon collects billions in fees.

44
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:49,580
The Internet,
as you know,

45
00:02:49,581 --> 00:02:51,980
it wouldn't exist without Amazon web 
services,

46
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:53,570
Netflix,
NASA,

47
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:55,400
Reddit,
the Obama campaign,

48
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:59,920
pinterest and the CIA are all hosted on 
its servers and a lot more.

49
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:01,323
It's a business that's growing fast and 
it's 10 times the size of its next 14 

50
00:03:05,441 --> 00:03:06,970
competitors combined.

51
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,413
It was Brian Romilly that payment's 
expert who pointed me in the direction 

52
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:14,440
of Amazon web services and and once you 
learn that business model,

53
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:16,450
it's easy to predict where Amazon is 
heading.

54
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:17,343
They want to combine their patents with 
marketing that creates this expectation 

55
00:03:21,281 --> 00:03:25,510
of a frictionless shopping experience.
Then they'll build a number of stores to

56
00:03:25,511 --> 00:03:26,344
prove the concept.
By the time they have a few 100 and 

57
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:32,500
operation,
the amount of refined targeted data that

58
00:03:32,501 --> 00:03:36,490
we'll be able to acquire on customers 
will make the model irresistible.

59
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:37,853
Komodo,
welcome back to the gap sort of tank 

60
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:44,770
tops for gap for you and that point 
Amazon just has to wait.

61
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:45,993
Supermarket chains nowhere near capable 
of retrofitting their stores with this 

62
00:03:48,821 --> 00:03:49,654
kind of tech will have one shiny place 
to turn for all their needs and just 

63
00:03:53,711 --> 00:03:54,544
like it does with its web services.
Amazon will license like crazy with 

64
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:01,420
their eyes toward dominating not just 
supermarkets,

65
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:04,030
but the entire retail universe.

66
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:07,960
A $25,000,000,000,000
industry in the US alone.

67
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,870
In other words,
Amazon go is just,

68
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:19,920
hey everybody,
thanks for watching.

69
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:20,843
Happy holidays.
I hope that you're with people that you 

70
00:04:22,621 --> 00:04:23,730
love.
This holiday season.

71
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,710
The nerdfighter is like insanely close 
to a million subscribers,

72
00:04:28,711 --> 00:04:30,300
which is messing with my head a little 
bit,

73
00:04:30,301 --> 00:04:31,134
but if you want to help me get there,
you can subscribe to the channel by 

74
00:04:33,091 --> 00:04:34,920
clicking this box that I've set up right
over there.

75
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,833
That's a huge milestone for me.
20 16 has been the best year of my life 

76
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:41,003
in huge part.
Thanks to you guys and everybody who 

77
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:43,824
watches the show,
everybody who's come onto the show this 

78
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,710
year and has really made this project 
something really special.

79
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,260
Thank you so much.
You're the best fans ever.

80
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,170
I'll see all of you next Wednesday.
