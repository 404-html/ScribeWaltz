1
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:21,450
Great Wings beating still above the 
staggering girl,

2
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:26,150
her thighs,
caressed by the dark webs her nape,

3
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:27,323
caught in his bill.
He holds her helpless breast upon his 

4
00:00:32,191 --> 00:00:33,024
breast.
How can those terrified vague fingers 

5
00:00:36,631 --> 00:00:37,464
push the feathered glory from her 
loosening thighs and how can body lead 

6
00:00:42,631 --> 00:00:47,631
in that white rush but feel the strange 
heart beating where it lies,

7
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,860
a shutter in the loins in genders there,
the broken wall,

8
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:58,040
the burning roof and tower and agamemnon
dead being so caught up,

9
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:04,080
so mastered by the brute blood of the 
air.

10
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:05,213
Did she put on his knowledge with his 
power before the indifferent beak could 

11
00:01:10,351 --> 00:01:11,184
let her drop later,
and the Swan is a sonnet that William 

12
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,330
Butler yeats wrote and rewrote many 
times,

13
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:20,373
but finally appeared in this form in his
renowned collection called the tower 

14
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:29,220
published in 1928 when he was 63.
The Tower was the first book of poems he

15
00:01:30,311 --> 00:01:34,330
released after becoming a Nobel laureate
five years prior.

16
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:39,610
Gates is of that exceptionally rare 
breed of artists who improved in quality

17
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,793
as he entered his late life.
The poem takes it subject from Greek 

18
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:46,690
mythology.
The story of Zeus,

19
00:01:46,691 --> 00:01:47,524
assuming the form of a swan to seduce 
later wife of the Spartan King 

20
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:54,460
[inaudible] who bore from this union,
Helen of troy,

21
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:59,700
whose infidelity ignited the Trojan war 
and the beginning of classical history.

22
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,910
Now,
before we explore the way yates used the

23
00:02:02,911 --> 00:02:03,744
subject to create meaning,
just take a quick look at the actual 

24
00:02:06,941 --> 00:02:10,560
shape of the poem.
There's something unsettling about it.

25
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:14,320
The form of the sonnet appears to be 
hijacked everywhere.

26
00:02:14,321 --> 00:02:15,154
It's twisted and torn apart like Dr.
Frankenstein Yates has surgically 

27
00:02:19,721 --> 00:02:23,260
attached the Shakespearean Sonnet with 
its first two quatrains,

28
00:02:23,261 --> 00:02:24,530
featuring an a,
a,

29
00:02:24,531 --> 00:02:25,364
b,
a b rhyme scheme with the Petrarchan 

30
00:02:27,641 --> 00:02:31,810
sonnet in the last six lines and an efg 
efg rhyme scheme,

31
00:02:31,811 --> 00:02:36,070
including the unnerving slant,
Ryan up and drop,

32
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,420
which robs the final moment of any 
auditory closure,

33
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:41,283
most notable of although his line 11,
which appears to be slashed and split 

34
00:02:45,731 --> 00:02:50,731
into leaving the final three lines,
just dangling there like late to herself

35
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:54,280
in the indifferent beak of the Swan.

36
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,293
In this way,
yates commits a kind of violence on the 

37
00:02:58,331 --> 00:03:00,070
sonnet form,
not for nothing.

38
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:04,990
The poet is attempting to augment the 
violent content of his work,

39
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:06,043
his sonnets,
at least she experienced on it's are 

40
00:03:07,961 --> 00:03:08,794
traditionally about great love,
and yet here yates uses the form to 

41
00:03:12,431 --> 00:03:15,790
describe what could be considered the 
exact opposite,

42
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:16,813
an act of violent rape,
and if you look at successive versions 

43
00:03:20,321 --> 00:03:21,154
of later and the Swan,
you can see that yates turned up the 

44
00:03:23,471 --> 00:03:25,720
volume on this violence.
For example,

45
00:03:25,721 --> 00:03:27,490
in one version,
the poem begins,

46
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:30,430
a rush a sudden we'll and hovering 
still,

47
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,473
the bird descends,
her frail thighs pressed by the webbed 

48
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,193
toes,
and that all powerful bill has laid her 

49
00:03:37,811 --> 00:03:40,720
helpless face upon his breast.
Now,

50
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:45,721
the early version almost assumes late as
acquiescence to the gods advances in the

51
00:03:46,781 --> 00:03:50,200
later version beginning with the shock 
of a sudden blow.

52
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:55,270
Zeus is molestation,
is intensely emphasize and emphasize too

53
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:56,223
is later and the readers disorientation 
the great wings beating still the 

54
00:04:01,451 --> 00:04:02,284
ambiguity of beating still.
How can wings be still if they're 

55
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,320
beating?
And on the other hand,

56
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:12,810
if he means that they're still beating,
that means terrifyingly,

57
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:17,230
that the rape has already begun while 
the swan is still in the air.

58
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:20,380
Now in this version,
the girl is staggering,

59
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:25,000
her thighs caressed a word that disturbs
us by comingling,

60
00:04:25,001 --> 00:04:27,910
the erotic with the vicious something 
that Yates does,

61
00:04:27,911 --> 00:04:32,860
a bunch of this poem caressed by the 
dark webs that gives a sense of just how

62
00:04:32,861 --> 00:04:35,560
big the bird is because not even the 
toes,

63
00:04:35,561 --> 00:04:36,394
but the webs between the toes are what's
caressing her and it should be noted 

64
00:04:40,091 --> 00:04:40,924
that both the first and second line and 
with anjem myths pulling us awkwardly 

65
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:49,420
through the verse,
and it's not until the last line of that

66
00:04:49,421 --> 00:04:51,790
first that we finally get the subject.

67
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:52,653
He as if everything was happening so 
fast that later couldn't find her 

68
00:04:56,681 --> 00:05:00,070
bearings until the gruesome act was 
already underway.

69
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,240
The first quatrain of later and the swan
is disturbing in the extreme,

70
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:07,600
setting the scene from latest,
horrified point of view.

71
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,673
Then we have the second quadrant,
which is made up of two rhetorical 

72
00:05:11,921 --> 00:05:15,040
questions,
both seem to ask the same thing.

73
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,580
What could lay to do against the awesome
power of a God?

74
00:05:18,581 --> 00:05:19,414
How could she possibly resist?
How can she do anything but feel the 

75
00:05:22,871 --> 00:05:27,730
strange heart beating where it lies?
These questions can be read in two ways.

76
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,090
You can read them rhetorically,
which is to say read them as saying,

77
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:35,410
obviously she can't do anything and such
as the tragedy of the poem,

78
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:39,940
but I think Yates invites us to read 
them literally as well,

79
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,833
which is to say what can she do more on 
that in a moment after the first two 

80
00:05:46,421 --> 00:05:47,254
verses comes the Volta,
a term for when a sonnet turns and the 

81
00:05:51,341 --> 00:05:56,020
questions or events posed in the first 
lines are answered in this case,

82
00:05:56,021 --> 00:05:56,854
after the shutter,
referring both to the moment of 

83
00:05:58,881 --> 00:06:01,070
ejaculation and latest fear.

84
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,143
We have the poet examining the 
consequences of the rate and they are 

85
00:06:05,421 --> 00:06:09,350
really far reaching the broken wall,
the burning roof and tower,

86
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:14,650
all intimate that the rape of late at 
not only caused but insured the eventual

87
00:06:15,261 --> 00:06:19,520
destruction of troy and the rise of 
Greece and western history,

88
00:06:19,521 --> 00:06:23,540
a history that was born out of rape,
war and murder,

89
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,520
and agamemnon dead.
Here we have gates own alteration to the

90
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:31,540
mythological history as the story goes,
later,

91
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,473
laid two eggs,
one bore helen and pollux Demi Gods and 

92
00:06:36,441 --> 00:06:40,550
children of Zeus and the other bore 
caster and Clayton Nestra,

93
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,850
children of latest mortal husband Tim 
Darrius,

94
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,630
who she laid with the same night by 
citing the death of Agamemnon,

95
00:06:47,631 --> 00:06:50,560
famously killed by his wife,
Clytemnestra,

96
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,510
as among the faded ramifications of the 
rape.

97
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,673
Yates demonstrates the full effect of 
the trauma and by doing this he reaches 

98
00:06:58,731 --> 00:06:59,564
into the history of art as well because 
the calls to troy and agamemnon staff 

99
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,650
bring to mind respectively.

100
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,573
Homer's Iliad,
the pinnacle of the epic form and 

101
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:12,230
escalates his play,
the Oresteia,

102
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,213
the first great work of Western drama.
All this is done in 11 words without 

103
00:07:19,281 --> 00:07:22,220
even mentioning the continued sexual 
overtones.

104
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:27,020
And then Yates concludes the poem with 
one final question.

105
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,453
Did she put on his knowledge with his 
power before at the indifferent beak 

106
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:33,163
could let her drop and to understand 
this and the poem itself and its larger 

107
00:07:36,741 --> 00:07:37,574
context,
we have to know a little bit more about 

108
00:07:39,441 --> 00:07:42,380
yates and his way of thinking from his 
early life.

109
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:45,620
Yates had always been drawn to 
mysticism,

110
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:49,640
to astrology and to the occult in Middle
Age,

111
00:07:49,641 --> 00:07:54,170
he developed his own complex 
metaphysical and cosmic system,

112
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:58,690
which he laid out in extreme detail in a
book called a vision.

113
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,073
One of the key ideas was that history 
was made up into gyres or cycles of 

114
00:08:05,031 --> 00:08:09,410
about 2000 years,
alternating between ages of spirituality

115
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:11,300
and ages of secularism.

116
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,433
Each cycle reached the peak of its 
excellence in the exact middle than 

117
00:08:15,921 --> 00:08:16,754
decades,
slowly until it was finally replaced by 

118
00:08:19,341 --> 00:08:20,174
the new one.
This idea was explored most potently in 

119
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:24,140
his famous poem.
The second coming,

120
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:25,423
Yates identified his own time,
our time as the end of the religious 

121
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:30,853
cycle of Christianity,
and envision the start of a new unknown 

122
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:37,580
cycle of secularism initiated by the 
coming of a great beast.

123
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:42,230
The last time such a cycle began is the 
subject of later and the Swan,

124
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:43,363
the rape of later by Zeus signals the 
start of the classical era around 2000 

125
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:50,270
BC.
In each case,

126
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:51,163
the divine visits,
the earth and leaves the seeds of the 

127
00:08:54,141 --> 00:08:58,230
history that is to come.
This is the key to this question.

128
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,430
Did she put on his knowledge with his 
power,

129
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:06,180
did later glimpse the future.
She was creating the cycle.

130
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:09,000
She was inaugurating before the 
indifferent.

131
00:09:09,001 --> 00:09:11,460
God flew away in some way.

132
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:16,460
He suggests the shape of things to come 
is contained in its origin,

133
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:20,490
but can humans discern it?
That's the question.

134
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:21,383
Now,
all this stuff about gyres and cycles 

135
00:09:23,761 --> 00:09:26,340
and mystical systems,
it's pretty out there.

136
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:30,750
Clearly it isn't in any way scientific 
or even very specific.

137
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:31,613
There's a real debate about whether 
Yates believed any of it probably in 

138
00:09:34,951 --> 00:09:35,784
some way he did,
but what was clearly more important to 

139
00:09:38,551 --> 00:09:43,551
him was having a unified system in the 
first place because it was from the many

140
00:09:44,071 --> 00:09:49,071
symbols of this unity that Yates was 
able to extract his strongest poetry.

141
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:54,800
Having that Matrix of sliding meanings 
to work with so tightly,

142
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:58,290
intricately woven meant that pulling one
string,

143
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,153
evoking one symbol,
laying one idea into the form and meter 

144
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:08,670
of a sonnet would make the rest of the 
web light up like a Christmas tree,

145
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:09,683
signifying a complexity that invites the
reader into a number of simultaneous 

146
00:10:13,921 --> 00:10:14,910
interpretations.

147
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:19,230
By situating the poem at a fulcrum in 
history equal to our own,

148
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,213
we're forced to look both at what we're 
coming out of and what we're heading 

149
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,890
toward.
A relevant question for any age,

150
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:26,873
particularly relevant for Yates's own.
When the trauma of World War One must 

151
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:35,640
have come like a sudden blow by,
posing questions if possible,

152
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:40,040
resistance to this brutal act,
but showing no resistance on the part of

153
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:40,913
later even possible enjoyment.
The readers themselves are called on to 

154
00:10:45,991 --> 00:10:50,991
imagine how we resist oppression and the
nature of resistance itself,

155
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:53,423
both from a feminist point of view and a
political one by depicting an encounter 

156
00:10:57,631 --> 00:10:58,464
with the divine,
so savagely we're asked to examine the 

157
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:06,750
price of inspiration and by posing 
questions without giving answers.

158
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:11,820
The knowledge and the power of poetry 
itself is called into question.

159
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:17,150
All these things are compressed into 
Yates's later and the swan spring loaded

160
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,680
triggered by an image or a tense or upon
or a slant.

161
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:23,514
Ryan,
that's so much can be packed into 14 

162
00:11:25,201 --> 00:11:26,034
lines and 113 words is a testament both 
to yates and the continuing importance 

163
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,633
of poetry.
All that's left is to pull one string 

164
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:40,560
and see what sublime network of meanings
lights up.

165
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,110
Hey everybody,
thank you so much for watching.

166
00:11:47,111 --> 00:11:49,630
I had so much fun putting this video 
together.

167
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,673
I love this poem.
I said in the last video that I'm doing 

168
00:11:52,691 --> 00:11:53,524
the nerd full time now and,
and this is the kind of quality of 

169
00:11:55,991 --> 00:11:56,824
content that I can make with this time 
and this effort and it's all possible 

170
00:12:00,911 --> 00:12:01,744
because you guys have been pledging to 
the channel on Patrion and I want to 

171
00:12:04,751 --> 00:12:05,584
continue to ask to donate a little bit 
of your money to this channel because 

172
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:13,960
there is so much more that I want to do 
and I'm so excited for this stuff that's

173
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,970
coming up.
So as little as a dollar,

174
00:12:15,971 --> 00:12:17,650
you can click right here on the screen 
right now.

175
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:20,290
Everything helps.
Thank you again so much.

176
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,480
Um,
if you want to check out another video,

177
00:12:22,481 --> 00:12:24,760
you can see my analysis of in the mood 
for love,

178
00:12:24,761 --> 00:12:26,500
which I did a couple of weeks ago.
Great movie.

179
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:30,820
I want to expand the series into a lot 
of different art forms and mediums.

180
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:33,700
Comics a,
even maybe music,

181
00:12:33,701 --> 00:12:35,260
TV,
lots of cool stuff.

182
00:12:35,261 --> 00:12:38,440
I think there's just a lot of 
opportunity for really awesome stuff and

183
00:12:38,441 --> 00:12:40,030
then some stuff that isn't understanding
art.

184
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:41,163
It's coming up too,
so thank you again and I will see you 

185
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:44,823
next time.
