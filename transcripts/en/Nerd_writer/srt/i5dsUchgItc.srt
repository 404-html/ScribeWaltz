Dear sam pepper,
a few weeks ago,

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:03,383
some hacker release nude photos of 
Jennifer Lawrence and some other 

3
00:00:06,331 --> 00:00:09,090
celebrities,
and that's something we've seen before.

4
00:00:09,091 --> 00:00:11,520
People's privacy being criminally 
violated,

5
00:00:11,521 --> 00:00:14,730
women being criminally objectified on 
the Internet.

6
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:18,420
What was surprising was the reaction in 
the days following the leak.

7
00:00:18,421 --> 00:00:22,920
Over two dozen articles appeared from 
different news and periodical sites with

8
00:00:22,921 --> 00:00:25,920
headlines like you know who's not to 
blame for Jennifer Lawrence's nude photo

9
00:00:25,921 --> 00:00:26,754
leaks.
Jennifer Lawrence stopped blaming 

10
00:00:28,141 --> 00:00:28,974
Jennifer Lawrence and other celebrities 
for taking nude photos in the first 

11
00:00:31,021 --> 00:00:31,854
place.
Jennifer Lawrence shouldn't laugh off 

12
00:00:33,031 --> 00:00:33,864
her nude photo.
Jennifer Lawrence nude pics and why you 

13
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:37,890
shouldn't look.
This isn't about iphones.

14
00:00:37,891 --> 00:00:40,080
This is about women being shamed,
objectified,

15
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,033
and treated like property.
These are what we refer to as opinion 

16
00:00:43,981 --> 00:00:48,120
pieces or think pieces and thanks to the
upworthy is one of the Internet.

17
00:00:48,121 --> 00:00:50,880
You can pretty much get there just from 
the headlines alone.

18
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:53,490
You've been a citizen of the web for the
last five or 10 years,

19
00:00:53,491 --> 00:00:57,600
so you know that the ubiquity of these 
pieces is growing all the time.

20
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:00,540
After any controversial event in society
or pop culture,

21
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:05,010
you can expect your facebook newsfeed to
overflow with articles like this.

22
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:09,900
Sometimes it's annoying people 
expressing offense as if a fence equated

23
00:01:09,901 --> 00:01:10,734
to righteousness or sites producing 
content just for the sake of producing 

24
00:01:14,071 --> 00:01:15,360
content.
Other times,

25
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:16,223
most of the time,
like in the case of that nude photo 

26
00:01:17,551 --> 00:01:19,830
league,
these articles taken together,

27
00:01:19,831 --> 00:01:22,920
express the politically correct view of 
the issue at hand.

28
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:23,783
Now,
political correctness has a bad rap in 

29
00:01:24,721 --> 00:01:25,554
general conversation and like the pieces
themselves that can serve to block 

30
00:01:28,861 --> 00:01:33,750
dialogue instead of just started,
but political correctness is itself only

31
00:01:33,751 --> 00:01:34,584
an expression of our democratic concern 
for groups who are habitually and 

32
00:01:38,371 --> 00:01:40,890
unfairly discriminated against.
In other words,

33
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,670
it's an expression of morality.
What we understand to be right and wrong

34
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:48,750
at this moment in time when coupled with
the ubiquity of these think pieces,

35
00:01:48,751 --> 00:01:49,584
it seems to me that socially enforced 
morality has reached an entirely new 

36
00:01:53,401 --> 00:01:56,100
level of persuasive power for the first 
time.

37
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,160
The majority of people.
I asked about the photo and particularly

38
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,143
men told me that they didn't seek out or
look at the photos in question citing 

39
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:04,883
the reasons in those articles,
even if you disagreed with what they 

40
00:02:07,441 --> 00:02:08,580
said,
which I didn't.

41
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:09,623
Those articles served as a sort of 
script for what to say to family and 

42
00:02:12,871 --> 00:02:13,704
friends and coworkers if you wanted to 
stay in good ethical standing with the 

43
00:02:17,131 --> 00:02:18,900
community that they represent.
Now,

44
00:02:18,901 --> 00:02:20,610
the response to your video,
Sam,

45
00:02:20,611 --> 00:02:24,060
of pinching girls on the butt is of the 
same vein only.

46
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:24,894
It didn't happen in online periodicals.
It happened right here on Youtube and 

47
00:02:28,981 --> 00:02:32,010
tumblr before it was taken down.
Your video had over double the amount of

48
00:02:32,011 --> 00:02:32,844
dislikes than likes about 70,000
and my tumblr feed was spilling over 

49
00:02:36,241 --> 00:02:37,074
with elegant condemnations of what you 
did have particular significance where 

50
00:02:40,021 --> 00:02:40,854
the responses of John and Hank Green,
who are never slow to speak out about 

51
00:02:44,371 --> 00:02:45,204
situations like this,
whether they would accept the title or 

52
00:02:46,891 --> 00:02:47,724
not,
the Vlog brothers have stepped forward 

53
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:51,900
as moral arbiter is on a host of issues.

54
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:55,170
Even if all they do is signal boost the 
opinions of others.

55
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:57,270
In the case of the marginalization of 
women,

56
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,111
see,
for example,

57
00:02:58,111 --> 00:02:58,944
the Alex Day deal,
they are never equivocal and their 

58
00:03:01,841 --> 00:03:04,660
community,
my community is the better for it.

59
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,030
Last Monday,
youtube removed your video,

60
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:07,893
Sam,
and though it clearly violated their 

61
00:03:09,191 --> 00:03:13,990
policy on nudity and sexual content,
there is no doubt that the public outcry

62
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:15,550
is responsible for that.
Look,

63
00:03:15,551 --> 00:03:18,130
I know this is a somewhat cold analysis 
of things,

64
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:21,430
but I'm fascinated by the sociological 
trends at work here,

65
00:03:21,431 --> 00:03:25,360
how moral perspectives move and advance 
through the culture,

66
00:03:25,361 --> 00:03:26,194
how and by what avenues they evolve from
dissenting to acceptable do 

67
00:03:30,281 --> 00:03:34,600
unquestionable and what role an internet
of commenters has to play and all that.

68
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:37,090
For the record,
I share the morality of the Vlog.

69
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:38,770
Brothers and everyone who has re 
blogged,

70
00:03:38,771 --> 00:03:39,604
what they've written about this,
the objectification of women is 

71
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:42,304
detestable in all its kinds,
especially those which are hard to see 

72
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,310
and insidious yet keenly felt by every 
woman.

73
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:52,960
I know this is a harmful gross and 
fucking tedious way to act.

74
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:56,260
There's still a long way to go,
but you and all the other Sam peppers of

75
00:03:56,261 --> 00:03:59,050
the world should really read the writing
on the dashboard.

76
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:01,930
Collectively.
We've left you behind.

77
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:04,500
Hey everybody.
Thanks for watching.

78
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:05,723
The gradual evolution of morality really
is fascinating to me and it has 

79
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:14,550
instruments all across the culture and 
the sharpest and most vicious has got to

80
00:04:14,551 --> 00:04:15,384
be South Park and a great example of an 
expression of morality from the culture 

81
00:04:19,681 --> 00:04:22,290
is their takedown of the redskins team 
name,

82
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:26,850
which appeared in a commercial during 
the redskins game last week and I'll put

83
00:04:26,851 --> 00:04:30,120
a link for it below.
South Park's amazing.

84
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:33,210
If you want to talk more about this,
I am always in comments for.

85
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,210
You can ask me anything on Tumbler.
Thanks again for watching.

86
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,380
I'll see you next time.
