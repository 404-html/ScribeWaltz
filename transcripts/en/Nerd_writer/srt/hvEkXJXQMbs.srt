00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:13,260
And Mail message from your local nerd 
writer.

2
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:14,713
Oh,
sorry,

3
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:16,140
didn't see you there.
Hi,

4
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,680
I'm the nerd writer and this week I'm on
my 52nd blog.

5
00:00:19,681 --> 00:00:22,680
That's a year's worth of logs.
So it's sort of a special occasion.

6
00:00:22,681 --> 00:00:25,710
So what I'm going to do is a question 
and answer blog.

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,753
Now people have asked me a lot of stuff 
in the comments before and I've never 

8
00:00:28,711 --> 00:00:31,770
really answered anything outright.
So here's your chance.

9
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,830
Ask me anything you want in the comments
of this video.

10
00:00:34,831 --> 00:00:38,370
And next week I'll do a vlog where I 
answer as many as I can.

11
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,220
Also,
if you haven't watched my blog from last

12
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,290
week a block,
51 New York City,

13
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:45,800
please do and vote for me and my 
destination dot coms.

14
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,520
The biggest,
baddest bucket list.

15
00:00:47,521 --> 00:00:51,630
If you think it would be cool to see me 
show you and teach you the world,

16
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,550
I think it would be pretty cool.
Um,

17
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,370
well actually I'd love to stay and talk 
more,

18
00:00:56,371 --> 00:01:00,150
but I have a prior engagement.
So ask your questions.

19
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,073
I'll see you next time.
