1
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:12,950
I am not a destroyer of companies.
I am a liberator up them.

2
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:20,170
The point is,
ladies and gentlemen at Gree,

3
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,440
for lack of a better word,
is good.

4
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:28,060
Greed is right.
Greed works.

5
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:31,980
Greed clarifies,
cuts through and captures.

6
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:33,343
Yes,
I think evolutionary spirit in all of 

7
00:00:37,421 --> 00:00:39,340
its forms,
we'd for life,

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,940
for money,
for love.

9
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:46,780
Knowledge has mark upward search of 
mankind in green.

10
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:52,090
You mark my words will not only save 
till dark paper,

11
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:55,420
but that other malfunctioning 
corporation called the USA.

12
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:57,490
Thank you very much.

13
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:01,430
Despite this famous speech from Oliver 
Stone's Wallstreet,

14
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,860
extolling the virtues of greed,
excess and capitalist,

15
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:09,840
no one could ever accuse stone or the 
film itself of doing the same thing.

16
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:10,763
Indeed,
it's because of Gordon Gekkos sermon 

17
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,080
that we know the opposite is true.
If we're all greedy,

18
00:01:16,081 --> 00:01:19,770
we can win together.
That's the essence of Geckos message.

19
00:01:19,771 --> 00:01:20,604
Of course,
oliver stone and the rest of us know 

20
00:01:21,931 --> 00:01:22,764
that in a connected capitalist society,
greed always works at the expense of 

21
00:01:28,111 --> 00:01:28,944
others and when later in the film we 
watch Bud Fox learn how Gecko plan to 

22
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,593
gain at the expense of his father.
The moral hypocrisy of Gecko and the 

23
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,730
film central condemnation of capitalists
excess is laid bare,

24
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:45,120
but that was then,
and this

25
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,450
I think I was asked,
is the omen.

26
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:53,290
I keep it on it like the Romans three 
pitches where the child is.

27
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:54,980
We live in the moment

28
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,953
26 years after Oliver Stone Wall Street,
Martin Scorsese gives us the wolf of 

29
00:02:08,031 --> 00:02:08,864
Wall Street.
Compare Gordon Gekkos moral defense of 

30
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:14,840
excess with these comments made by 
Scorsese's protagonists.

31
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:18,500
Jordan Belfort,
I was selling garbage to garbage men and

32
00:02:18,501 --> 00:02:21,440
making cash hand over fist,
so I was selling them shit.

33
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:25,460
The way I looked at it,
their money was better off in my pocket.

34
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:28,700
I knew how to spend it better for unlike
Gecko,

35
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:32,510
makes no moral argument for his great.
He knows what he's doing is wrong.

36
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,673
He does it anyway.
There no great tragedy haunting his 

37
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:36,254
steps like the downfall of Gordon Gekko 
or the extreme paranoia and eventual 

38
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:43,280
disappearance of one of Scorsese's other
great protagonists,

39
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,233
Henry Hill from goodfellas.
Belfour does go to prison for a short 

40
00:02:47,361 --> 00:02:48,950
time,
but as he soon discovers,

41
00:02:48,951 --> 00:02:49,784
see for a brief fleeting moment,
I'd forgotten I was rich and I lived in 

42
00:02:56,001 --> 00:02:56,834
a place where everything was for sale 
for its crimes are met with minimal 

43
00:03:01,121 --> 00:03:03,880
punishment,
both physical and psychological,

44
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,100
and just to twist the knife on that 
fact,

45
00:03:06,101 --> 00:03:09,790
scorsese has the man himself,
the actual Jordan Belfort,

46
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,950
introduces character as

47
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,580
single,
baddest motherfucker I have ever met,

48
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:19,900
so maybe it's no surprise that the wolf 
of Wall Street was raked through the mud

49
00:03:19,901 --> 00:03:22,960
by a number of critics for glorifying 
apologizing,

50
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:26,680
endorsing capitalists.
Excess Scorsese's film certainly doesn't

51
00:03:26,681 --> 00:03:30,820
offer the negative critique of tragedies
like Wall Street or goodfellas.

52
00:03:30,821 --> 00:03:31,654
It doesn't even offer a satirical 
critique of late capitalism such as you 

53
00:03:34,571 --> 00:03:39,040
might see in films like American Psycho,
where Patrick Bateman's smooth,

54
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:43,120
almost enlightened exterior is 
undermined by his psychopathy,

55
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,670
self-loathing and psychological 
breakdown.

56
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:51,610
A satirical critique of capitalism would
require the movie itself in its tone and

57
00:03:51,611 --> 00:03:56,611
themes to ridicule or expose the 
improper behavior it displays,

58
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,650
but the wolf of Wall Street gives us no 
such thing.

59
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,460
The joke is never on Jordan Belfort.
It's on everyone else,

60
00:04:03,461 --> 00:04:04,960
his wife,
his friends,

61
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:05,913
his enemies and the world at large.
We're not made aware of some unknown 

62
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,870
underwriting.
Sadness,

63
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:11,883
quite the opposite.
Belfort is perfectly disaffected by the 

64
00:04:14,351 --> 00:04:19,040
scummy ways he makes his money and the 
debauchery lifestyle he spends it on.

65
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,450
His personal philosophy,
echoes that of alien from harmony,

66
00:04:22,451 --> 00:04:24,730
corrine's spring breakers.
Some people,

67
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:29,920
they want to do the right thing.
Doing the wrong thing was always telling

68
00:04:29,921 --> 00:04:30,431
me,
no,

69
00:04:30,431 --> 00:04:35,431
you've got to change.
I'm about and change stack and change as

70
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:37,443
it money.
Both films are prime examples of what 

71
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:40,624
film critic is he black has called the 
new cinema of excess films in which 

72
00:04:44,711 --> 00:04:49,630
greed and excess are explored,
but never for a moment condemned.

73
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,713
Indeed.
A key feature of this kind of cinema is 

74
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:55,720
that the film itself partakes in the 
excess.

75
00:04:55,721 --> 00:04:58,300
It shows nowhere is this more clear than
in Wolf,

76
00:04:58,301 --> 00:05:01,540
which runs for three hours and moves 
from montage too.

77
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:04,410
Montage in ever crazier flights of 
hedonism,

78
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:05,733
but just because Scorsese refuses to 
condemn bail for it doesn't mean that 

79
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:13,060
he's by extension endorsing him.
Either.

80
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:16,210
Excess is excess.
It's exhausting.

81
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,530
It's too much,
too fast.

82
00:05:17,531 --> 00:05:22,531
Scorsese has no illusions about this.
His extensive use of closeup reveals the

83
00:05:22,691 --> 00:05:27,580
vulgarity of this way of living is 
montage is exhaust rather than glamorize

84
00:05:27,581 --> 00:05:30,820
the hedonism two,
which were privy is less attractive than

85
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,190
disorienting,
less desirable than

86
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:38,030
well will not die sober,
get don't fuck.

87
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,010
Walls.
Street

88
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:44,290
is a descriptive project learning from 
its moralizing predecessors,

89
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,920
even the predecessors in Scorsese's own 
filmography.

90
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:52,150
There were no bud Fox is to take down 
the Gordon Gekkos of the eighties.

91
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,630
There wasn't even any one to take down 
Belfort's elk in the nineties.

92
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,480
The folly of late capitalism got worse 
and worse,

93
00:05:59,481 --> 00:06:03,170
not hitting its lowest point until 2008 
in the financial recession,

94
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:05,960
and it's unclear despite new 
regulations,

95
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:09,500
if any of those lessons were really 
taken to heart.

96
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,513
The reason for this is because the 
excesses of Jordan Belfort are our 

97
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:16,910
excess.
It's like him were to enlightened not to

98
00:06:16,911 --> 00:06:17,744
know the expenses,
which are gazillion products are made 

99
00:06:20,751 --> 00:06:21,584
like him.
We don't really make an attempt at 

100
00:06:23,271 --> 00:06:26,090
moralizing away.
Our involvement in that system.

101
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:31,540
We just don't care to discuss.
We feel for Belfort is hypocritical.

102
00:06:31,971 --> 00:06:32,804
The indignation we inflict on him is 
less a righteous act than a self 

103
00:06:36,641 --> 00:06:37,474
righteous dilution.
Scorsese refuses to participate in that 

104
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,193
delusion anymore,
and the result is a film so 

105
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:50,291
unapologetically excessive that the 
audience might finally realized that the

106
00:06:51,141 --> 00:06:54,560
screen they thought they were watching 
was

107
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,630
in fact a camera.
