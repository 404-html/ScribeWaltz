1
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:03,850
Unlike in live action,
cinematography,

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:07,510
lighting in animation,
it's something that's built totally from

3
00:00:07,511 --> 00:00:09,310
scratch.
In other words,

4
00:00:09,311 --> 00:00:10,144
well in live action,
light is controlled sometimes too 

5
00:00:12,641 --> 00:00:16,780
brilliant effect in animation.
Light is created.

6
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:20,170
Of course these days a lot of animated 
light is computer generated,

7
00:00:20,171 --> 00:00:21,004
meaning that virtual lights can be 
placed in three d environments and 

8
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:26,950
actually play off solid surfaces like 
they would in real life,

9
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:28,323
like the control of actual lights.
This too can be used to beautiful 

10
00:00:30,761 --> 00:00:31,594
effect,
but today I want to talk about lighting 

11
00:00:33,461 --> 00:00:36,610
as it was done in traditional hand drawn
cell animation,

12
00:00:36,611 --> 00:00:40,490
particularly in the groundbreaking anime
film by Ketso Hero Tomo,

13
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,673
Akira.
Now Kira is well known for it's 

14
00:00:43,421 --> 00:00:44,254
painstaking animation.
Every frame of the film was composed 

15
00:00:47,261 --> 00:00:48,094
with the closest attention to detail and
color and that gives it an unmatched 

16
00:00:52,061 --> 00:00:54,170
richness and soul.
For this reason,

17
00:00:54,171 --> 00:00:55,004
the cure,
it is also a film that's been 

18
00:00:55,691 --> 00:00:58,660
painstakingly picked over and analyze by
others,

19
00:00:59,020 --> 00:00:59,853
but one thing I haven't heard much about
is the way that lighting is used by the 

20
00:01:03,191 --> 00:01:05,290
filmmakers.
Because I see the films,

21
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:06,124
many lights.
There are different qualities and 

22
00:01:07,331 --> 00:01:12,331
textures as a powerful motif and symbol 
and a vital element of it's genius

23
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,730
backgrounds must still be photographed 
by the master camera in technicolor.

24
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:23,030
Yeah.
They operate with the Donald Duck on top

25
00:01:23,031 --> 00:01:25,820
of a background as the overhead camera 
exposures.

26
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:26,960
One frame of film,

27
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,033
like I said,
Akira was a film made in the cell 

28
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:32,630
animation style developed in the first 
half of the 20th century,

29
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:33,643
which involves drawing and painting on a
transparent slides and layering them 

30
00:01:36,501 --> 00:01:37,334
over a background frames composed like 
this were photographed and strung 

31
00:01:40,341 --> 00:01:41,174
together to create the animation.
This Two d traditional style coupled 

32
00:01:44,421 --> 00:01:45,254
with the tropes of anime means that the 
light and Akira is specific and 

33
00:01:49,521 --> 00:01:51,800
pronounce the lines between shadow and 
light,

34
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:52,903
are distinct and evocative in the same 
way that film noir lighting is and like 

35
00:01:57,031 --> 00:01:57,864
in film noir light and Akira is 
intimately connected to the city at 

36
00:02:02,271 --> 00:02:03,860
night.
This for example,

37
00:02:03,861 --> 00:02:04,694
is the very first shot after the opening
credits of flickering neon sign for the 

38
00:02:07,881 --> 00:02:08,714
neighborhood bar.
Where can neda is waiting for his 

39
00:02:10,221 --> 00:02:12,680
friends?
Nothing could more concisely communicate

40
00:02:12,681 --> 00:02:15,530
the rundown dystopic feeling of the 
future.

41
00:02:15,531 --> 00:02:20,030
Tokyo Tomo is going to present us with 
in the very next shot and throughout the

42
00:02:20,031 --> 00:02:20,864
film.

43
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:21,703
Indeed,
this is a city as sorted romantic and 

44
00:02:23,841 --> 00:02:24,674
multifarious as the lights that slash 
across it's million surfaces to make a 

45
00:02:28,881 --> 00:02:31,940
delicate whole,
the city where the disenfranchised young

46
00:02:31,941 --> 00:02:32,774
mark their presence and their 
personalities with the streaks of light 

47
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:36,763
that their motorcycles leave behind the 
city where authority is as much a 

48
00:02:40,191 --> 00:02:43,850
blinding spotlight as it is a gun or a 
badge.

49
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:44,703
Oh,
Tomo has said that he wanted Tokyo 

50
00:02:45,801 --> 00:02:46,634
itself to be a major character and Akira
and one of the ways he flushes this out 

51
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:50,893
is with light,
particularly neon neon has a special 

52
00:02:53,751 --> 00:02:57,020
significance for both Tokyo and the 
cyberpunk genre.

53
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:02,320
It is the bitter but beautiful that 
signifies both the colorful radiance and

54
00:03:02,411 --> 00:03:07,411
the Gadi consumerism of modernity.
That dark dystopian side of which remain

55
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:10,330
cyberpunks basic focus.
Tokyo for its part,

56
00:03:10,331 --> 00:03:15,010
has been a cultural hub for neon signage
ever since 1957.

57
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:15,873
When the Sukkot company unveiled its 
giant 30 foot neon billboard in the 

58
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:22,660
Ginza district revealing its new name.

59
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,610
Sony.
Since then,

60
00:03:24,611 --> 00:03:27,040
the science have proliferated becoming a
signature,

61
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:27,874
even a tourist attraction of Tokyo's 
nightscape and novels like William 

62
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,793
Gibson's neuromancer films like blade 
runner took the vivid and suggestive 

63
00:03:35,951 --> 00:03:40,080
qualities of Tokyo's neon as their 
palate for oblique tech.

64
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:43,300
Saturated future,
Akira continues this tradition,

65
00:03:43,301 --> 00:03:44,134
but here are the neon quality,
infuses all the light sources of the 

66
00:03:47,051 --> 00:03:48,700
film,
both inside and out.

67
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:52,840
There's the neon on the buildings,
but there's also the neon bright screens

68
00:03:52,841 --> 00:03:53,674
that shine and the characters faces and 
the neon control panels of bright 

69
00:03:56,741 --> 00:03:57,574
primary colors.
The spotlights that rove in the sky are 

70
00:04:00,131 --> 00:04:03,040
like giant neon tubes being waved back 
and forth.

71
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:06,250
Machine gun fire is a barrage of neon 
streaks.

72
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,740
Even the sunlight shining through the 
windows has a bluish neon quality to it.

73
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:14,130
In neon neo,
Tokyo and its inhabitants aren't so much

74
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,083
lit as caught caught in this huge 
incandescent web that serves only the 

75
00:04:20,251 --> 00:04:21,084
mandates of money capital in that web 
government is as impotent as a biker 

76
00:04:26,491 --> 00:04:28,410
gang made up of disaffected children.

77
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,873
It's funny that industry business is 
notably absent from the films plot 

78
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:36,830
because it's DNA seems to be in the 
corners of everything.

79
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,073
We blink and you might miss a newsreader
at the beginning of the movie shining 

80
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:41,403
from another flickering lights,
source reporting riots of unemployed 

81
00:04:44,561 --> 00:04:49,090
workers after tax reforms.
Maybe this is why tetsuo at once,

82
00:04:49,091 --> 00:04:51,610
the protagonist and the antagonist of 
the film,

83
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,633
a boy who gains extremely Mary psychic 
power so often produces a disruption in 

84
00:04:57,381 --> 00:04:58,214
the light around him,
whether it's in his own mind or in the 

85
00:05:02,031 --> 00:05:05,870
form of explosion or in the aura around 
him,

86
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:06,853
even in the vibrant dancing waveland 
that his brain patterns create indeed 

87
00:05:11,241 --> 00:05:15,320
psychic power most fully realized in 
Tetsuo and his counterpoint,

88
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:16,363
Akira represent the only kind of power 
that can have an effect on the state of 

89
00:05:20,301 --> 00:05:21,620
things.
In Neo Tokyo.

90
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,873
This is perhaps the reason that the 
protesters turned to Akira for their 

91
00:05:25,971 --> 00:05:26,804
salvation because even when the 
authorities turned their biggest 

92
00:05:29,331 --> 00:05:30,164
spotlight on him,
a mega satellite laser that takes the 

93
00:05:32,751 --> 00:05:36,320
name of our son,
he comes out the victor.

94
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:37,543
In the end,
the salvation represented in Tetsuo 

95
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,273
comes at the cost of ruin.
A catastrophe which consumes neo Tokyo 

96
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,103
in the form of a giant ball of light,
one single uniform white light that 

97
00:05:50,271 --> 00:05:53,030
erases the countless artificial lights 
of the city.

98
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:53,933
Oh,
Tomo seems to suggest that there's some 

99
00:05:55,131 --> 00:05:55,964
freedom in this,
some rebirth as true sunlight wipes 

100
00:05:59,001 --> 00:05:59,834
across the city in patches.
When you have to draw light 24 times in 

101
00:06:04,911 --> 00:06:05,744
every second of a two hour movie,
it must be the case that you gain a new 

102
00:06:09,141 --> 00:06:09,974
appreciation for how it can tell the 
story of its own and that's what our 

103
00:06:13,271 --> 00:06:14,104
Tomo and his crew have done and Akira 
light is layered into the story like 

104
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:23,180
it's layered into the animation cells 
pointing toward meaning behind the film,

105
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:26,120
at the corners of it,
and illuminating from different angles,

106
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:29,030
the characters and their place in this 
neon world.

107
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,493
In other words,
a Kira is a great example of how you 

108
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:35,960
animate light.

109
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,560
Everybody.
It is great to be back home,

110
00:06:42,561 --> 00:06:44,720
back to work,
and back on schedule.

111
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,760
Finally,
you want to subscribe to the channel.

112
00:06:46,761 --> 00:06:48,050
By the way,
you can click right there.

113
00:06:48,051 --> 00:06:48,884
That box over there.
I have to thank crunchy roll for 

114
00:06:50,481 --> 00:06:52,670
sponsoring this video.
If you don't know what control is,

115
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:57,440
it's like a great service where you can 
access tons of different anime shows and

116
00:06:57,441 --> 00:06:59,840
movies.
Obviously I love and May I love Akira,

117
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:05,010
but you can get stuff like an hour after
it airs on TV in Japan on crunchy roll.

118
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:07,640
I want to recommend one.
It's cowboy bebop.

119
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:09,830
You haven't seen it.
It is an amazing,

120
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:10,693
amazing show.
Might actually analyze it sometime in 

121
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:13,150
the future,
but um,

122
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,510
anyway,
they're a great service.

123
00:07:14,511 --> 00:07:15,344
They do really hd episodes.
You can get it on apple TV or Roku or 

124
00:07:17,331 --> 00:07:20,480
whatever you have and if you sign up at 
[inaudible] dot com slash nerd writer,

125
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,990
you can get a free 30 day trial,
which is awesome.

126
00:07:23,991 --> 00:07:24,824
And they're awesome for sponsoring the 
show without interfering in the content 

127
00:07:26,781 --> 00:07:29,420
in any way or asking to.
Thank you guys for that.

128
00:07:29,421 --> 00:07:31,730
And I'll see everybody else next 
Wednesday.
