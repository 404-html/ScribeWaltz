1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:04,260
I think I can sum up the show for you 
with one word,

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,810
nothing,
nothing.

3
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:12,563
What does that mean?
It wasn't until episode three of season 

4
00:00:16,681 --> 00:00:17,514
four that Seinfeld gave itself that 
famous description as a show about 

5
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,100
nothing,
not until this episode called the pitch,

6
00:00:26,101 --> 00:00:26,934
which mock documents Jerry and Larry 
David's first meeting with NBC 

7
00:00:31,081 --> 00:00:33,500
executives.
Nothing happens on the shelf,

8
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:36,960
just like life.
The interview since then like this,

9
00:00:36,961 --> 00:00:37,794
Reddit Ama from 2014,
the creators admit that the moniker was 

10
00:00:40,771 --> 00:00:44,850
only really a joke and that they were 
actually surprised by how much it caught

11
00:00:44,851 --> 00:00:45,684
on with audiences and yet I think the 
nothing in question is a good lens to 

12
00:00:50,971 --> 00:00:51,804
examine this show through to explore 
what makes it different from other 

13
00:00:55,261 --> 00:01:00,090
sitcoms and so popular still today.
And when you think of Seinfeld,

14
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:00,983
the first thing that pops into your head
probably isn't 19th century French 

15
00:01:04,621 --> 00:01:05,454
novelist gustave flow bear,
but there's a connection here that I 

16
00:01:09,121 --> 00:01:11,310
think is worth exploring a little bit.

17
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:16,410
So you bear was a pioneer of literary 
realism in large part,

18
00:01:16,411 --> 00:01:17,244
responsible for raising the status of 
the novel to that have a high art so 

19
00:01:22,081 --> 00:01:22,914
intense with his dedication to craft 
that in a letter to Luis call a in 

20
00:01:26,491 --> 00:01:28,440
January 18,
52,

21
00:01:28,441 --> 00:01:29,274
he wrote what seems beautiful to me.
What I should like to write is a book 

22
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,033
about nothing,
a book dependent on nothing external 

23
00:01:38,491 --> 00:01:42,150
held together by the internal strength 
of its style.

24
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:43,170
Now,
of course,

25
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:47,100
a novel like Madame bovary isn't 
literally about nothing.

26
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,160
The book explores themes of freedom,
love,

27
00:01:50,161 --> 00:01:54,230
and Human Stupidity,
and explores them deeply the differences

28
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,073
that flow bear.
Instead of getting at these themes 

29
00:01:56,911 --> 00:02:01,911
through subject and plot like his 
predecessors treats them with style.

30
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:06,060
He doesn't just want to string you along
with multiple suspense,

31
00:02:06,061 --> 00:02:06,894
heightening narrative developments.
He wants to bring you into the text 

32
00:02:10,711 --> 00:02:15,570
itself to look there for the carefully 
constructed meanings that he's built for

33
00:02:15,571 --> 00:02:16,110
you.

34
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:19,590
So in full bear says he wants to write a
book about nothing.

35
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:20,873
What he really means is nothing like the
established forms and genres against 

36
00:02:26,161 --> 00:02:28,920
which he situated himself.
Indeed,

37
00:02:28,921 --> 00:02:33,000
in any art form,
the positive value of a work in question

38
00:02:33,001 --> 00:02:33,834
has to be determined against or in 
negative relation to the other kinds of 

39
00:02:37,711 --> 00:02:38,544
work already present in the form.
By the 19 fifties and number of 

40
00:02:41,581 --> 00:02:45,210
conventions for the television Sitcom 
had already been established.

41
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:49,560
Family had become the dominant setting 
for the situation comedy.

42
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,580
These sitcoms feature predominantly 
white middle class families,

43
00:02:52,581 --> 00:02:53,414
sometimes with kids sometimes without 
dealing comedically with a problem of 

44
00:02:57,121 --> 00:02:57,954
the week before resolving the issue and 
coming together into a kind of unity so 

45
00:03:01,661 --> 00:03:03,730
that they could do the same thing again 
next week.

46
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,930
We sure are.
Come on.

47
00:03:08,931 --> 00:03:09,764
Sugar.

48
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,890
What time of the Mary Tyler Moore Show?
In the 19 seventies,

49
00:03:12,891 --> 00:03:16,490
the nuclear family had been partly 
supplanted by the family,

50
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:21,050
but the sentimental unity of the group 
was an even stronger value.

51
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:24,230
Thank you for being my with cheers.
In the eighties,

52
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:27,920
Sitcom began to break from.
It's by then state conventions.

53
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:28,873
There was less sentimentality,
less less than learning and the 

54
00:03:30,831 --> 00:03:31,664
transition from family as family or 
family as coworkers to family as 

55
00:03:35,271 --> 00:03:36,104
friends,
and yet still there was a drive toward 

56
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,340
unity,
namely and cheers.

57
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:42,980
The Romantic unity between Sam and 
Diane,

58
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,980
which gave the show a familiar dramatic 
weight.

59
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:46,610
Okay,
okay.

60
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:47,443
Okay.
I got it.

61
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:48,803
You run an antique store and people come
into the store and you get involved in 

62
00:03:54,451 --> 00:03:55,284
their lives.
What person who runs an antique store 

63
00:03:57,991 --> 00:03:58,824
gets involved in people's lives,
so someone comes in to buy an old lamp 

64
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,190
and suddenly I'm getting them out of a 
jam.

65
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,013
Wasn't until

66
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:12,380
I felt that the conventions of the 
Sitcom work deconstructed fully when all

67
00:04:12,631 --> 00:04:16,170
forms of unity,
familial and especially romantic,

68
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:19,560
were whole heartedly abandoned for 
Seinfeld.

69
00:04:19,561 --> 00:04:22,650
These additional elements,
we're just so much fluff.

70
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:23,643
Well,
forget the store.

71
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:25,750
They to have a story.
He says,

72
00:04:25,751 --> 00:04:26,584
you got to have a store

73
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,080
like flow bears,
novels.

74
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:31,620
Seinfeld for goes the traditional 
subject matter of the Sitcom.

75
00:04:31,621 --> 00:04:32,454
It's didactic.
Sentimentality centered around a family 

76
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:36,024
of one kind or another in favor of 
stories held together by the internal 

77
00:04:40,171 --> 00:04:42,630
strength of its comedy.
Now,

78
00:04:42,631 --> 00:04:45,030
this isn't to say that Seinfeld doesn't 
have plots.

79
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:48,630
It he seinfeld plots are among the most 
sophisticated of the genre,

80
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,380
but the plot drivers are different from 
it's predecessors.

81
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:57,030
Instead of goal oriented principle 
characters achieving their ends based on

82
00:04:57,031 --> 00:05:00,690
actions that they take.
Seinfeld frequently has its characters.

83
00:05:00,691 --> 00:05:03,760
Make some small action on a whim at the 
start of it

84
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,110
episode,
certain cast member of melrose place.

85
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:11,830
Really have you ever seen the show know,
then spend the rest of the half hour.

86
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:15,840
We're dealing with the unintended 
consequences of that action.

87
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:16,920
Kimberly's steel Joe's,

88
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,190
and if they do set out to achieve

89
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,790
a goal,
even if they get turned on,

90
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:26,500
they often fail in the end because of 
circumstances beyond their means.

91
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:27,933
Can I be expected to have the same 
expertise as people who own this 

92
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:34,090
equipment in Seinfeld?

93
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,003
More complicated narrative.
Small events from one character's life 

94
00:05:37,861 --> 00:05:38,694
can determine outcomes in another.
Any action that any character takes has 

95
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:45,330
unexpected consequences,
so that coincidence,

96
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,223
merely a device in traditional goal 
oriented sitcoms becomes the rule on 

97
00:05:50,941 --> 00:05:53,670
Seinfeld.
That's the guy officer

98
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:56,590
Larry.

99
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:57,423
David's no hugs,
no learning policy for Seinfeld is in 

100
00:06:01,281 --> 00:06:02,114
keeping with the show based on refusals,
refusal to entertain sentimental 

101
00:06:06,171 --> 00:06:07,280
endings,
real Rome,

102
00:06:07,281 --> 00:06:11,000
hence of any kind or the redemptive 
power of the family.

103
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:15,020
And in doing so,
David and Seinfeld rejected the silently

104
00:06:15,021 --> 00:06:15,854
agreed upon moral standards that guided 
every other sitcom to it's weekly 

105
00:06:20,031 --> 00:06:21,830
resolutions.
Again,

106
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:25,400
like madame bovary,
Seinfeld isn't literally about nothing,

107
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,090
but instead of reinforcing larger moral 
standards,

108
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:33,230
it explored insanely minute social 
norms.

109
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:36,800
The women know about shrinkage.
What do you mean like laundry?

110
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:39,110
Interestingly,
hilariously,

111
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:40,003
it turns out that while the morals of 
past decades have shifted and changed 

112
00:06:43,431 --> 00:06:44,264
under our feet,
these petty behavioral questions about 

113
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,273
nothing,
all that important proved to be more 

114
00:06:51,951 --> 00:06:56,951
timeless and timelessly funny than just 
about everything else.

115
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,440
Hey everybody,
thanks for watching.

116
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:11,303
Obviously I'm a huge Seinfeld fan,
so getting to watch a lot of seinfeld 

117
00:07:14,461 --> 00:07:15,294
episodes to make this video was a blast.
I'm also getting to read a lot of flow 

118
00:07:18,061 --> 00:07:22,760
bear because I'm a huge fan as well.
And I like to say the word below bear.

119
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:25,230
Um,
I want to thank you guys so much because

120
00:07:25,231 --> 00:07:26,680
after a couple of weeks ago,
uh,

121
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,533
my video on Harry Potter,
I mentioned how important small pledges 

122
00:07:30,091 --> 00:07:30,924
on my patrion where,
because of the length of time is more 

123
00:07:33,451 --> 00:07:34,860
important than,
than,

124
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:35,723
than the amounts.
And that is because it helps me plan on 

125
00:07:38,071 --> 00:07:39,900
this channel what I'm going to do next,
what's coming.

126
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:43,430
And after that video,
a lot of you guys pledged a dollar or $3

127
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:45,120
and you're awesome for that.
So thank you.

128
00:07:45,121 --> 00:07:45,661
Thank you.
Thank you.

129
00:07:45,661 --> 00:07:46,470
Thank you.
Thank you.

130
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:49,320
We just crossed 250,000
subscribers on this channel,

131
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:53,070
which is a quarter million and met some 
number that I can't really conceive.

132
00:07:53,071 --> 00:07:53,904
So I am grateful and that's the feeling 
that I'm going to keep putting out into 

133
00:07:57,001 --> 00:07:57,720
the world.
Um,

134
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,940
so thank you so much for that.
If you want to pledge to my channel,

135
00:07:59,941 --> 00:08:00,774
you can go right here and click there 
and I will see you guys next one state 

136
00:08:03,661 --> 00:08:06,090
for another video.
This is so much fun.
