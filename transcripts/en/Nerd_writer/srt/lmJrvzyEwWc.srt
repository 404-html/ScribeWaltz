1
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:07,750
I didn't get a tear.
You lift sap.

2
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:11,380
Yeah,
that's what I'm gonna do,

3
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:16,263
I'm gonna tear your eyes

4
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,460
out of the socket.

5
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:27,720
I'm gonna hit you,
and you're gonna fall,

6
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:31,853
so this is a scene that came out of a 
nineties television show for children 

7
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,600
that may be hard to believe,
but then again,

8
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:40,583
a lot of the scenes that came out of the
Ren and stimpy show pretty hard to 

9
00:00:43,561 --> 00:00:45,780
believe.
I'm a child of the nineties and no,

10
00:00:45,781 --> 00:00:46,614
I haven't seen many of the episodes of 
this show for well over a decade on 

11
00:00:49,921 --> 00:00:50,754
rewatching the series.
I was amazed by how much of the imagery 

12
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:54,023
was lodged deep in my memory,
like the walls of tiers that welled up 

13
00:00:58,261 --> 00:00:59,094
and were ejected out of stimpy's eyes in
this episode called the little giant or 

14
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:07,300
the nerve endings that were 
excrutiatingly plucked out of Rennes gum

15
00:01:07,301 --> 00:01:08,134
sockets.
And of course every gruesome yet 

16
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:10,913
painterly,
extreme closeup that became a staple of 

17
00:01:13,411 --> 00:01:17,070
the show and a few that followed along 
with the simpsons.

18
00:01:17,071 --> 00:01:22,071
Ren and stimpy was a seminal cartoon of 
the animation renaissance that hit TV in

19
00:01:22,141 --> 00:01:23,280
the early 19 nineties.

20
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,540
Whereas the simpsons was focused on 
sharp satirical writing,

21
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,270
Ren and stimpy and its creator John 
Crikey Volusia.

22
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:33,690
We're obsessed with unique,
detailed and highly,

23
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,553
very animation techniques.
I think this is why the imagery of Ren 

24
00:01:37,351 --> 00:01:39,630
and stimpy really leaves a mark on your 
brain.

25
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:40,733
Quick Volusia was coming from a 
notorious starkey gene commercial 

26
00:01:43,111 --> 00:01:43,944
animation in which the production of 
shows was fragment in an outsourced 

27
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:50,460
overseas to places like Taiwan and the 
Philippines.

28
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:55,730
Plotlines were simple cliche and facial 
expressions were relegated to happy,

29
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,640
sad and confused,
and that's about it.

30
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:01,560
There's a million versions of happy and 
sad and perplexed,

31
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,230
and then there's all these other kinds 
of emotions that I've labeled,

32
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:08,850
but you can draw them.
I urged my artists all the time to never

33
00:02:08,851 --> 00:02:10,890
draw an expression that they've drawn 
before.

34
00:02:10,891 --> 00:02:13,490
So you're not allowed.
Quickfire.

35
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,353
Lucy found his sensibility,
apprenticing and working cowork Ralph 

36
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:18,973
Bash in animation legend who was 
producing some of the only interesting 

37
00:02:21,571 --> 00:02:23,340
commercial work of the 19 seventies.

38
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:24,503
He married the surreal often disturbing 
field bash key stuff with the dense 

39
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:32,700
energetic style of Bob Clampett cartoons
of the 19 thirties and forties,

40
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,260
like Clampett,
quick flu seat.

41
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,440
Wanted Ren and snippy to be filled with 
a new idea.

42
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,453
Every second,
we just take a look at these handful of 

43
00:02:40,351 --> 00:02:43,140
frames from what's probably the best 
episode of the series,

44
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:45,870
stimpy's invention,
every frame.

45
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:50,360
It's a completely new drawing.
The scrip floozy once said of Clampett.

46
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:54,340
It doesn't even look like it animates 
yet in real time.

47
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:55,283
It works perfectly.
It communicates a totally unique 

48
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:01,780
emotion,
quick volusia his team or after with Ren

49
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:02,614
and stimpy,
two characters that actually got under 

50
00:03:04,691 --> 00:03:05,524
your skin to characters that were so 
unique and dense in their movement and 

51
00:03:08,591 --> 00:03:11,800
speech that you had to see a soul in 
them,

52
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:12,783
however twisted that Sol was,
and this quality has to be what makes 

53
00:03:15,701 --> 00:03:19,300
the show so disturbing to every slimy,
gunky,

54
00:03:19,301 --> 00:03:24,301
sweaty Harry Wu's had an unnerving 
reality and the show played on anxieties

55
00:03:25,211 --> 00:03:26,044
about bodily fluids at a time when the 
United States was at the height of its 

56
00:03:28,991 --> 00:03:30,450
fears about the aids.

57
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,720
Derek,
I believe that they should have separate

58
00:03:32,721 --> 00:03:33,554
hospitals so that the people that have a
good go in there and not be in regular 

59
00:03:36,711 --> 00:03:38,540
hospitals but that day,
but

60
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,433
kids loved Ren and stimpy.
It had higher ratings in its first year 

61
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:45,920
than fellow Nick toons,
Doug and regret's combined.

62
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,830
The creators maintained that they were 
on the kids side,

63
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,840
spoonfed morals in school at home and on
just about every children's show,

64
00:03:53,841 --> 00:03:57,440
animated or not.
Ren and stimpy offered lesson free,

65
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,810
Zany Gross,
ridiculous humor.

66
00:03:59,811 --> 00:04:00,644
What quick flu see,
believe was the point of cartoons 

67
00:04:02,631 --> 00:04:03,464
anyway,
and escape parents groups protested the 

68
00:04:05,481 --> 00:04:06,314
show,
but the audience had spoken and indeed 

69
00:04:07,851 --> 00:04:08,684
in that first year at 35 percent of the 
people who watched ren and stimpy were 

70
00:04:11,481 --> 00:04:12,314
over 18 years old.
MTV started rerunning the first season 

71
00:04:15,621 --> 00:04:17,630
at 7:00
PM instead of 11:00

72
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:21,620
AM viewing parties were arranged at 
college campuses and for good reason,

73
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:24,950
like the adult swim cartoons that are in
many ways it's spawn.

74
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:25,933
Ren and stimpy mixed absurd character 
driven action with sly parodies of 

75
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:34,120
earlier cartoons,
satirical and sometimes treasonous gags.

76
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,083
Like when powdered toast man burned the 
bill of rights in the constitution to 

77
00:04:37,431 --> 00:04:42,431
keep warm sexual innuendo that was off 
the charts and just genuinely terrifying

78
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:46,450
moments.
The police,

79
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:52,100
Ren and stimpy didn't hold back on the 
insanity of its characters.

80
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:53,123
Number of times.
Wren goes completely psychotic and the 

81
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:59,780
honesty and quick for Lucy's voice 
acting coupled with the manic animation,

82
00:04:59,781 --> 00:05:03,500
including glaring abstract backgrounds 
and sound effects,

83
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:08,950
is enough to pull the viewer into the 
cartoon and into that palpable distress.

84
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:16,250
The creators of Ren and stimpy had 
healthy disdain for the way cartoons had

85
00:05:16,251 --> 00:05:17,084
aggressively commercialized and 
commodified childhood with merchandise 

86
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:25,470
as simple well as simple as a log log,
and they regretted that their peers were

87
00:05:26,121 --> 00:05:29,810
forced feeding ethical norms to their 
audiences on a weekly basis,

88
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:33,380
so they made a show that brilliantly 
mocked these things,

89
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:34,483
but I don't think Crikey,
for Lucy's ultimate goal was to make 

90
00:05:36,351 --> 00:05:37,184
something for adults.
I think he wanted to create a show for 

91
00:05:39,651 --> 00:05:40,484
kids to marvel at something that yanked 
your attention the way the old clampett 

92
00:05:43,731 --> 00:05:47,600
cartoons did something as dark and seedy
as the original fairytales,

93
00:05:47,601 --> 00:05:52,601
but uproariously funny and inventive in 
every frame to do this scrip flu seat,

94
00:05:53,001 --> 00:05:57,740
push the system to its limits and was 
eventually fired after the season.

95
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:00,800
The show went on,
but the richest episodes were during his

96
00:06:00,801 --> 00:06:01,634
reign in 91 and 92.
The series masterpiece stimpy's 

97
00:06:04,311 --> 00:06:09,230
invention took a full year to produce.
Now maybe that was overkill,

98
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:10,183
but at the same time,
it's no doubt that obsessive attention 

99
00:06:12,711 --> 00:06:17,711
to detail that burned ren and stimpy 
onto all of our brains

100
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,373
forever.

101
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,590
Hey everybody,
thanks for watching.

102
00:06:45,591 --> 00:06:49,430
My brain is complete mush after watching
a week of Ren simpy,

103
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:52,940
but it was so worth it.
It's genius genius show 'em.

104
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,290
Anyway,
follow me on twitter.

105
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:55,940
I never mentioned twitter on this end 
screen,

106
00:06:55,941 --> 00:06:57,650
but a lot of cool things are happening 
there,
