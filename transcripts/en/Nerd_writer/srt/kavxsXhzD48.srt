1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,833
There are a few ways that you can build 
up tension in a movie scene through 

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,880
camera work,
through pacing,

3
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:16,330
and probably most commonly through 
music,

4
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:17,403
like the music you're hearing right now 
in this incredibly tense scene from 

5
00:00:19,931 --> 00:00:22,870
Steven Spielberg's,
2005 film Munich,

6
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:29,010
except there is no music in the seat,
but I'm getting ahead of myself.

7
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,593
Let's back up.

8
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:38,703
We all know that movies have only two 
ways into your brain through your eyes 

9
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:43,503
and your ears,
but if you've ever had the chance to 

10
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,370
edit a movie or a short film or even a 
small video,

11
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:51,340
it quickly becomes apparent that when 
you're watching something,

12
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:54,760
these two senses are weirdly 
interconnected.

13
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:58,570
The visual side of film gets most of the
attention because it's right in front of

14
00:00:58,571 --> 00:01:01,270
you and it's usually what you remember 
after a movie is over,

15
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:05,350
but in many ways the visuals are simply 
the face of the operation.

16
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:08,440
While the audio is actually the puppet 
master,

17
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:09,870
the one that really holds them

18
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:12,590
power.
Okay?

19
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,630
Let me show you what I mean.
Take a look at this scene right here.

20
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,850
So what does Spielberg want you to pay 
attention to?

21
00:01:34,851 --> 00:01:38,360
Hear these people walking by and this 
car passing,

22
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:40,850
no,
it's not what Spielberg wants.

23
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:42,163
It's what I want.
Since that was the sound design I just 

24
00:01:44,631 --> 00:01:47,340
made for that shot.
Here's what the actual shots sound stuff

25
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:54,590
still,
besides

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,300
being infinitely better,
it's easy to notice how the sound really

27
00:02:09,301 --> 00:02:12,690
affects what you see and from what 
perspective you see it.

28
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:13,943
In my version,
the shot had an omniscient third person 

29
00:02:16,351 --> 00:02:19,890
point of view in the real version.
As soon as the audio starts,

30
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,753
you're placed in a perspective.
The first thing you hear is a 

31
00:02:22,951 --> 00:02:27,270
conversation from street level,
so even though the long lens is fixed on

32
00:02:27,271 --> 00:02:28,104
Eric Bana,
you know the moment is taking place on 

33
00:02:30,301 --> 00:02:32,280
the ground.
Then to drive the point home,

34
00:02:32,281 --> 00:02:33,114
you hear Daniel Craig singing the 
temptations and the vocal recording is 

35
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,740
close,
intimate.

36
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:41,490
Even though you never go inside the car,
that's enough to put you there.

37
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:44,010
Then the car that you're really supposed
to pay attention to,

38
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:47,910
the black one parks and the sound of it,
parking jumps out in the mix.

39
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:51,180
Just like you wouldn't hear Daniel Craig
in that way from where the camera is.

40
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,253
You wouldn't hear the car that clearly,
but the sound design picks these things 

41
00:02:54,961 --> 00:02:59,961
out to tell a specific story.
Still stays shut up.

42
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,953
The point here is that in film you 
really do see with your ears more than 

43
00:03:05,621 --> 00:03:09,730
you think and sound doesn't mind.
That image gets the credit because a key

44
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:12,670
to the power of sound design is its 
invisibility.

45
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:13,803
If dialogue sounds close than you are 
close to the person who's speaking it 

46
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:18,723
wherever they are.
My brothers would choose my Papaya and 

47
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,900
my sister were both hanging.
Okay,

48
00:03:24,901 --> 00:03:26,850
so back to the sequence.
Oh yeah,

49
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:28,450
forgot.
No music

50
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:34,940
for a minute and 52nd seat is without 
music and almost entirely wordless.

51
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:36,223
How does Spielberg and legendary sound 
designer Ben Burtt who gave the world 

52
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:43,910
this?
How do they build the tension here?

53
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,013
Well,
burt does it by building a bed of 

54
00:03:46,521 --> 00:03:51,521
constant noisy city ambiens.
Then singling out and stringing together

55
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:55,490
like beads on a wire.
Key noises that tell the story.

56
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:56,653
The background is that Eric Bana and his
team are going to assassinate this man 

57
00:03:59,421 --> 00:04:00,254
and his home by getting him to answer a 
phone that they've secretly installed a 

58
00:04:02,811 --> 00:04:06,770
bomb in the string of isolated plot.
Sounds goes like this.

59
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:07,993
The car with the assassins arrives the 
dialogue of the targets wife and 

60
00:04:11,721 --> 00:04:16,460
especially young daughter than their car
pulling away signaling it's safe to move

61
00:04:16,461 --> 00:04:17,294
forward.
Then the coins and rotary phone that 

62
00:04:19,611 --> 00:04:22,970
will make the call then the priming of 
the detonator

63
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:27,110
and then wait,
what was that

64
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,490
first moment of trouble comes in south.
Up until now,

65
00:04:32,491 --> 00:04:36,330
the isolated noises represent the steps 
of the plan going smoothly.

66
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:40,560
The truck passing by represents a break 
in that chain and a hitch in the plan.

67
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:42,563
At this point,
the ambience outside starts to take on 

68
00:04:44,161 --> 00:04:44,994
some strange qualities.
There's a high pitched whine like a 

69
00:04:47,311 --> 00:04:51,240
train stopping on top of everything,
and just like the moving truck blocks,

70
00:04:51,241 --> 00:04:52,074
the assassins view,
the movers talking keeps them from 

71
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:56,970
hearing the daughter's car pull back up 
to the apartment.

72
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:00,150
She plays a key part in the scene.
So burt isolates her again,

73
00:05:00,151 --> 00:05:02,820
but not her voice this time.
Her footsteps,

74
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:06,990
which continue indoors in the apartment,
the ambiance is quiet,

75
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,093
and the really incredible thing about 
this scene is that Burton Spielberg 

76
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,310
build the tension not by working toward 
a great crescendo of noise,

77
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:18,120
but by gradually subtracting elements.
Once the daughter is up here,

78
00:05:18,121 --> 00:05:20,640
the danger can be signaled by a single 
sound.

79
00:05:20,641 --> 00:05:20,780
Okay,

80
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:21,613
perfect.

81
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:24,813
The important elements have been set up 
so well by this point that you could 

82
00:05:27,581 --> 00:05:30,550
follow the rest of the scene without 
seeing it at all.

83
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:40,140
All right.
Hello.

84
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,920
Hello.
Hello.

85
00:05:58,910 --> 00:05:59,743
I know

86
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:06,040
the climax of this scene brilliantly is 
silence,

87
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:07,653
but it's the silence that works so well 
because it anticipates the noise of an 

88
00:06:11,651 --> 00:06:16,651
explosion to come.
At this point.

89
00:06:25,381 --> 00:06:26,214
The ambience has become really 
impressionistic and when it comes back 

90
00:06:28,591 --> 00:06:30,330
in,
it has echo and reverb.

91
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,760
It's hurried footsteps and an anxious 
siren.

92
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,690
The wholesale universe corresponds in a 
personal way to the assassins,

93
00:06:36,691 --> 00:06:37,524
to their feelings and their nerves,
so it makes sense that when the final 

94
00:06:40,531 --> 00:06:41,364
question is asked,
it's the sound design that answers the 

95
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:45,943
off.
I'm not sure what they're doing in film 

96
00:06:47,311 --> 00:06:48,144
school these days,
but if you have any interest in making 

97
00:06:49,981 --> 00:06:50,410
movies

98
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,243
at all,
you shouldn't attempt to make a scene 

99
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,070
like this.
No dialogue,

100
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,310
no music,
just camera work in sound design.

101
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,040
Once you finished it,
watch the scene back.

102
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:04,040
Close Your eyes and ask yourself,

103
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:05,860
what are your ears?
See?

104
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:15,883
Hey everybody,
