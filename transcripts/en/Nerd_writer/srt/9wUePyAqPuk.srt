00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:08,463
Nights ago,
my girlfriend and I had a couple drinks 

2
00:00:09,991 --> 00:00:10,824
and convinced ourselves that we needed 
to go down the street to bonds for 

3
00:00:14,251 --> 00:00:15,084
snacks.
We ended up with a sort of weird 

4
00:00:16,651 --> 00:00:19,980
grouping of six items,
toasted sesame water crackers,

5
00:00:19,981 --> 00:00:23,100
some smoked mozzarella cheese chick pea 
chips,

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,680
it dozen eggs because you always need 
eggs.

7
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:26,573
This sweet young coconut,
because I saw it near the cash register 

8
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:33,960
and scallions because honey,
why don't we get scallions again?

9
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:37,560
I have no idea.
Well,

10
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,320
apparently nobody knows why.
We got the scallions.

11
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,130
Anyway,
we enjoyed the snacks.

12
00:00:41,131 --> 00:00:44,670
They were all really good,
but then I happened to look at the check

13
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:49,790
and I realized that I had accidentally 
paid for 17 federal programs.

14
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,210
Not exactly,
but let me explain.

15
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:55,403
This year,
the federal budget requests for the 

16
00:00:56,371 --> 00:01:00,060
corporation for public broadcasting.
The organization that runs pbs,

17
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:00,894
NPR and over 1400 locally owned public 
radio and television stations is 

18
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:09,690
$445,000,000
using the latest census information that

19
00:01:09,691 --> 00:01:14,691
comes out to a dollar and thirty seven 
cents per American per year or about the

20
00:01:15,301 --> 00:01:19,350
cost of 12 and a half toasted sesame 
water crackers.

21
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:20,573
The National Endowment for the arts,
once a budget of only $150 million to 

22
00:01:23,161 --> 00:01:23,994
help fund our exhibitions and our 
education across the country to help 

23
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:28,283
America imagine itself artistically.
Each of us has to pay just this much 

24
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,473
smoked mozzarella cheese per year.
You might be wondering why I'm bringing 

25
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:39,390
all this up.
It's because in the next few weeks,

26
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:40,253
you're likely to see the trump 
administration proposed dramatic budget 

27
00:01:42,721 --> 00:01:43,554
cuts to the federal government that will
seek to prioritize the corporation for 

28
00:01:46,441 --> 00:01:47,274
public broadcasting and eliminate the 
national endowment of the arts 

29
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,473
completely as well as 15 other programs.
Thanks to some good work from Taylor 

30
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:57,180
temper over at Time magazine.
We know that taken together,

31
00:01:57,181 --> 00:01:58,014
these 17 programs will cost every 
American $22 and thirty six cents per 

32
00:02:02,221 --> 00:02:03,054
year.
The exact cost of my late night snack 

33
00:02:05,221 --> 00:02:06,054
run.
Here's what they'll each costs you 

34
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:11,370
individually and what they do.
Cue The montage music.

35
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:14,780
The National Endowment for the 
humanities helps fund museums,

36
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,200
colleges,
libraries,

37
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,880
and things like Ken Burns.

38
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:22,650
Awesome civil war documentary.
It'll cost you the price of just one egg

39
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,280
in the minority business development 
agency promotes the growth of businesses

40
00:02:26,281 --> 00:02:28,950
owned and operated by minority 
entrepreneurs.

41
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:33,660
It costs everyone just eleven cents or 
this many chopped scallions.

42
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,733
You can fund the Economic Development 
Administration and organization that 

43
00:02:37,441 --> 00:02:38,274
supplies regional and local businesses 
with the infrastructure they need to 

44
00:02:41,311 --> 00:02:46,020
compete in the global market for 20 
percent of the water in this coconut for

45
00:02:46,021 --> 00:02:48,120
the cost of six water crackers with 
cheese,

46
00:02:48,121 --> 00:02:50,130
you can support the international trade 
administration,

47
00:02:50,131 --> 00:02:50,964
which helps enforce trade law for US 
companies for 20 percent of one bag of 

48
00:02:54,661 --> 00:02:55,494
chick pea chips.
You'll fund the manufacturing extension 

49
00:02:57,691 --> 00:02:58,524
partnership,
which is dedicated to small and medium 

50
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:04,420
sized manufacturers.
For 17 percent more chicken chips.

51
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06,730
You'll fund the office of violence 
against women,

52
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:07,773
which oversees programs across the 
country that reduce domestic violence 

53
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,553
and sexual assault.
The Legal Services Corporation helps 

54
00:03:13,571 --> 00:03:16,060
poor Americans afford legal services.

55
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:19,690
That'll cost you just three eggs,
fried plus some scallions.

56
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:20,763
The civil rights division of the Justice
Department fights discrimination and 

57
00:03:22,691 --> 00:03:23,524
protects voting rights.
That'll cost you just a couple shots of 

58
00:03:25,721 --> 00:03:26,554
coconut water,
plus some scallions to fund the UN 

59
00:03:28,721 --> 00:03:30,490
intergovernmental panel on climate 
change,

60
00:03:30,491 --> 00:03:33,160
which compiles the latest scientific 
data on global warming.

61
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,233
You have to throw in just this much of a
chick pea chip you office of 

62
00:03:37,331 --> 00:03:38,164
electricity,
deliverability and energy reliability 

63
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:42,670
invests in making our energy grid more 
stable and secure.

64
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:46,420
It costs all the scallions.
The scallions are really cheap,

65
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,463
and finally the office of energy 
efficiency and renewable energy aids 

66
00:03:50,261 --> 00:03:53,350
efforts to transition America to a clean
energy economy.

67
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,540
It's the most expensive of the bunch you
get.

68
00:03:55,541 --> 00:04:00,541
It only cost the price of one box of 
water crackers and one bag of chips.

69
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:02,743
The blueprint for these cuts comes from 
a paper put out by the Heritage 

70
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,793
Foundation,
a conservative think tank that has long 

71
00:04:07,761 --> 00:04:08,594
argued for eliminating federal programs 
as a way to reduce our 

72
00:04:11,091 --> 00:04:13,010
$20,000,000,000,000
national debt.

73
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:18,640
But the problem is that altogether these
programs are asking for only seven point

74
00:04:19,371 --> 00:04:20,204
$3,000,000,000,
which is one percent of the non defense 

75
00:04:23,451 --> 00:04:25,550
discretionary spending that our 
government does.

76
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:28,760
Fully half of discretionary spending 
goes to the military.

77
00:04:28,761 --> 00:04:32,510
Something that the trump administration 
is not likely to slash all that much,

78
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:35,990
and in total,
all discretionary spending makes up only

79
00:04:35,991 --> 00:04:39,380
31 percent of the federal budget.
The rest goes to social security.

80
00:04:39,381 --> 00:04:40,214
Medicare,
Medicaid entitlements that trump has 

81
00:04:41,991 --> 00:04:45,110
also vowed not to touch.
In other words,

82
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:45,973
privatizing or eliminating b 17 programs
is really only a symbolic gesture that 

83
00:04:50,601 --> 00:04:51,434
won't do much of anything.
The good news is that this is a fight 

84
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:54,943
that should be pretty easy to win.
If you're willing to spend drunkenly or 

85
00:04:58,101 --> 00:04:58,934
not.
Twenty $2 and thirty six cents on these 

86
00:05:00,731 --> 00:05:03,920
17 programs,
call your congressman and say so,

87
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,173
and if they want to know why you think 
privatizing pbs or killing the National 

88
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,720
Endowment of the arts is a bunch of 
bullshit,

89
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:14,210
feel free to send them this video.

90
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,880
Hey everybody.
Thanks for watching.

91
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:27,400
Nerdwriter tee shirts still available at
[inaudible] dot com.

92
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,980
Send me a picture if you've got one.
Anyway,

93
00:05:29,981 --> 00:05:32,980
thanks to crunchy roll for sponsoring 
this episode.

94
00:05:32,981 --> 00:05:33,814
If you don't know,
crunchy roll is like the Netflix of 

95
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,750
animated.
It's really cool.

96
00:05:37,751 --> 00:05:40,450
It's got thousands of titles,
all hd,

97
00:05:40,451 --> 00:05:43,330
and if something errors in Japan,
it's going to be on crunchy roll an hour

98
00:05:43,331 --> 00:05:44,164
later so you can see the latest stuff,
anime stuff coming out of Japan on 

99
00:05:46,871 --> 00:05:49,090
crunchy roll.
I want to recommend cowboy bebop,

100
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,830
which is,
in my opinion,

101
00:05:50,831 --> 00:05:55,210
a work of art and if you sign up at 
[inaudible] dot com slash nerd writer,

102
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:59,260
you can get a free 30 day trial which 
would allow you to watch that show and I

103
00:05:59,261 --> 00:06:00,910
think that you would really like it.
Um,

104
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,833
anyway,
I'll see you guys next Wednesday and 

105
00:06:03,671 --> 00:06:04,504
thanks again for watching.
