1
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:06,363
Okay,
what you're about to experience is 

2
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:08,703
shocking for them,
a German term for taking pleasure in 

3
00:00:11,021 --> 00:00:13,780
someone else's misfortune.
Let's back up a bit.

4
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,860
There's a cottage industry around 
shopping online.

5
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:25,830
It's why fail videos get tens of 
millions of views,

6
00:00:25,831 --> 00:00:27,690
and it's why there's so much fun to 
watch.

7
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:28,763
Fail compilations are an evolution of 
things like jackass and the America's 

8
00:00:32,341 --> 00:00:33,174
funniest home video format,
which is really just a nonfiction 

9
00:00:35,461 --> 00:00:36,294
version of the slapstick comedy that you
see in the three stooges or Charlie 

10
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,440
Chaplin movies where Shakespeare's 
comedies going all the way back probably

11
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:47,070
to the origin of laughter itself.
Why do we feel this way?

12
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:48,053
What makes us enjoy the pain of others?
It comes down to identity and self 

13
00:00:52,471 --> 00:00:53,304
esteem.
Human society is defined by competition 

14
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,160
and comparison.
When you see someone fail,

15
00:00:58,161 --> 00:01:00,580
your psyche is rewarded with a little 
boost.

16
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:04,200
The feeling that you're better off than 
they are shopping for to is particularly

17
00:01:04,201 --> 00:01:05,034
strong wind.
The failure in question is arrogant or 

18
00:01:06,841 --> 00:01:07,674
deserving or even just to successful.
That's why we delight when celebrities 

19
00:01:11,401 --> 00:01:12,390
fall from grace.

20
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:13,523
It's why the downfall of super high 
achievers like tiger woods generates so 

21
00:01:16,441 --> 00:01:21,030
much media attention in societies.
These feelings extend to our groups.

22
00:01:21,031 --> 00:01:25,200
The more we identify with our Ingroup,
like our favorite sports team,

23
00:01:25,201 --> 00:01:26,034
for example,
the more susceptible we are to shot in 

24
00:01:27,581 --> 00:01:29,970
Florida.
When a rival team loses.

25
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,110
Now in the realm of sports and people 
falling off,

26
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,000
rope swings,
feelings of shot and Florida are natural

27
00:01:36,001 --> 00:01:38,820
and innocent.
Self esteem is not a steady thing.

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,970
Fluctuates and if it fail,
compilation makes you laugh.

29
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,400
Why not?
Were shot in Florida,

30
00:01:44,401 --> 00:01:48,090
I think becomes poisonous is in the 
universe of politics.

31
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:49,373
I mean if Shoutin,
Florida is a feature of ingroups and 

32
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:54,360
outgroups in competition,
it should be no surprise that it festers

33
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,373
in our political parties where the 
victory of one side almost always means 

34
00:01:58,681 --> 00:02:00,970
a defeat of the other and studies on 
Shoutin,

35
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,580
Florida in politics bear this out.

36
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:03,443
Intensity of party affiliation strongly 
predicts whether events produce shot in 

37
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:08,124
Florida in their members when the 
Republican party missteps or one of its 

38
00:02:11,161 --> 00:02:11,994
members commits a gaffe.
Democrats report feelings of shopping 

39
00:02:14,371 --> 00:02:17,970
for them and vice versa.
What complicates things is that politics

40
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:21,330
involves the wellbeing and the suffering
of millions of people.

41
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,590
The failure of your opponent group can 
often spell objectively bad consequences

42
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,453
for everybody,
and yet the most disturbing finding of 

43
00:02:28,441 --> 00:02:32,160
studies on Shodan 40 to in politics is 
that even in these cases,

44
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:36,240
people report shouting for that as long 
as their opponents lose out.

45
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,313
Scary as that is,
you can take solace in the fact that 

46
00:02:39,151 --> 00:02:42,990
most people understand that these 
feelings are socially inappropriate,

47
00:02:42,991 --> 00:02:46,020
which is why they're felt that not 
really spoken about studies.

48
00:02:46,021 --> 00:02:46,854
Bear this out to those who report 
feelings of Shodan for at objectively 

49
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:50,754
bad news like an economic downturn 
hurting the opposing party are also 

50
00:02:54,511 --> 00:02:59,500
deeply ambivalent about just having that
emotion or at least they to be.

51
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:04,330
All I did is point out the fact that on 
the cover of the national enquirer,

52
00:03:04,331 --> 00:03:09,331
there's a picture of him and crazy Lee 
Harvey Oswald having breakfast now.

53
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:15,850
10 never denied that it was his father.
One of the things that troubled me about

54
00:03:15,851 --> 00:03:16,684
the 2016 election was the presence of 
Shodan Freida among Democrats and 

55
00:03:20,381 --> 00:03:23,800
opponents of Donald Trump.
He seemed to free people up somehow,

56
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:24,693
and I think it's because ambivalence 
about shotgun Florida in politics is a 

57
00:03:27,731 --> 00:03:28,564
result of the fact that on some level we
believe our opponent group is genuinely 

58
00:03:32,621 --> 00:03:35,110
trying to help.
We're just going about it the wrong way.

59
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:37,750
Trump,
on the other hand is so cartoonish,

60
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,673
so nakedly selfserving that any 
reservations people might have about 

61
00:03:41,831 --> 00:03:42,664
basking in his blunders just evaporated.
Donald trump is the perfect figure for 

62
00:03:46,721 --> 00:03:49,720
Shotgun Florida.
He checks every box arrogant,

63
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,430
successful,
deserving.

64
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:54,310
What's more,
he openly participates in it himself.

65
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:57,850
It's Rubio,

66
00:03:58,810 --> 00:03:59,643
right?

67
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:04,480
I offered the opportunity for guilt free
shot in Florida,

68
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:08,620
and this is what troubles me because it 
was natural for trump supporters to take

69
00:04:08,621 --> 00:04:09,454
pleasure in his candidacy,
but what I saw all around me was his 

70
00:04:12,251 --> 00:04:15,340
opponents feeling the same way.
For many,

71
00:04:15,341 --> 00:04:18,970
it was just as enjoyable as watching a 
fail compilation video.

72
00:04:18,971 --> 00:04:19,804
Seeing him make appalling comment after 
appalling common at the start when he 

73
00:04:23,591 --> 00:04:24,424
was a joke,
there seemed to be a little harm and 

74
00:04:25,841 --> 00:04:30,790
expressing the shotgun Florida,
but there was an effect because the news

75
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:31,624
media registered this feeling as 
interest and as a result gave an 

76
00:04:35,381 --> 00:04:38,650
enormously lopsided amount of media 
coverage to his campaign,

77
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:39,783
which may trump the focus of everything.
It may be the first time in US history 

78
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:47,890
that collective shoutin Florida 
influenced a political outcome,

79
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,293
and that's not a joke at all.
Right now we're living through an 

80
00:04:51,671 --> 00:04:54,640
intoxicating mixture of entertainment,
politics,

81
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,560
journalism,
and shot in Florida.

82
00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:00,910
It's a mixture that is unbelievably 
great for the news media and as trump is

83
00:05:00,911 --> 00:05:04,930
embroiled in the Russia investigation,
the news media is showing its best side,

84
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,720
but it's worth site two with each new 
revelation,

85
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:11,290
each new bombshell report the Shazam for
you to become stronger,

86
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:15,250
and that incentive is impossible for 
media executives to resist.

87
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:16,743
If trump goes down,
it'll be met with alation from certain 

88
00:05:18,941 --> 00:05:21,700
sectors of the public and who knows he 
may deserve it,

89
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,830
but whatever happens with his presidency
shot in Freud,

90
00:05:24,831 --> 00:05:29,140
it is a drug that we ought to keep in 
check because like any drug,

91
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:30,063
a growing tolerance will eventually mean
a growing desire for more of it more 

92
00:05:34,091 --> 00:05:34,924
often,
and that's not a force we want power in 

93
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:38,043
our politics.

94
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,000
