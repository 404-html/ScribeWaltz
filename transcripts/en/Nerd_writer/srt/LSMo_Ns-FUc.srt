1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:00,863
Hey y'all,
you phenoms and filibusters coffee on a 

2
00:00:02,461 --> 00:00:05,550
Tuesday and Vlog 56.

3
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:18,973
Yeah,
so I cheated a lot in high school and 

4
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:22,154
college usually was by the old classic 
method of just looking over at the 

5
00:00:24,321 --> 00:00:25,154
person's test next to you.
Sometimes I'd write information on a 

6
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:32,110
little crib sheet or save stuff in my 
trusty ti 83 calculator and I do vaguely

7
00:00:32,481 --> 00:00:33,314
remember trying to steal tests from a 
teacher's desk once though I can't be 

8
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:39,530
sure if that was only something I saw in
a movie.

9
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,210
Oh,
thank you.

10
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:45,050
Mostly I cheated on tests or homework.
Never really on term papers.

11
00:00:45,051 --> 00:00:45,884
I never plagiarize for some reason.
Getting caught plagiarizing seemed like 

12
00:00:48,321 --> 00:00:50,720
the worst thing that could happen to you
when I was in school.

13
00:00:50,721 --> 00:00:53,630
Although for my very final paper in 
college,

14
00:00:53,631 --> 00:00:57,800
I did hand in my roommate's history 
essay on the Nazis.

15
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:00,980
I was taking a sociology class,
but you know the Nazis,

16
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:06,040
they really cover a lot of ground 
already.

17
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:09,103
I haven't spent a lot of time thinking 
about it since really I didn't think 

18
00:01:11,361 --> 00:01:15,770
about it much at the time.
I suppose I just knew that the old adage

19
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:16,783
cheaters never win,
which just a cracker because I cheated 

20
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,640
and one now I don't encourage cheating,
of course not,

21
00:01:22,641 --> 00:01:26,360
but it is a part of my life and I think 
it's worth exploring a little bit more.

22
00:01:26,361 --> 00:01:30,950
Cheating is simply acting dishonestly to
gain an advantage in high school.

23
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:35,030
What was the advantage that I wanted or 
thought I needed to gain?

24
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,500
Well,
where I went to school,

25
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,260
the primary purpose of school was not to
learn,

26
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:43,730
although that was not a negative upshot.
The primary purpose of school was to get

27
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,760
good grades so we could get into a good 
college,

28
00:01:46,761 --> 00:01:47,594
so when we graduated we'd have the 
empirically proven advantage of getting 

29
00:01:51,261 --> 00:01:54,190
a good job so we wouldn't be degenerate.

30
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,570
The motivational structures were 
achingly clear.

31
00:01:56,571 --> 00:02:00,590
The point was to get good grades,
not to get good grades.

32
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,870
Honestly,
the only reason to act honestly was that

33
00:02:02,871 --> 00:02:05,300
you wouldn't run the risk of getting 
caught cheating,

34
00:02:05,301 --> 00:02:06,134
which would after all,
injure your ability to achieve the goal 

35
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:11,510
in the first place.
The ironic thing is that so pressured as

36
00:02:11,511 --> 00:02:15,320
we were to achieve the good grade and 
the good college and the good job,

37
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,273
we saw no qualms in cheating to get 
there and having cheated to get there 

38
00:02:19,491 --> 00:02:23,180
and having got there with the good job 
in a world where cheating is much,

39
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,103
much less viable.
We all have work ethics that are 

40
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:31,570
absolute and we're all that much closer 
to being degenerate.

41
00:02:31,611 --> 00:02:32,444
Sometimes I laugh about that randomly on
the subway or just walking down the 

42
00:02:34,881 --> 00:02:35,714
street and people look at me strangely,
but it's just the kind of joke that's 

43
00:02:37,941 --> 00:02:40,250
too damn funny to keep in,
you know?

44
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,920
Can you blame me for cheating?
Of course you can.

45
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,793
I cheated and I'm not the only one.
A rutgers study from way back in 1997 

46
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:48,943
before there were sat prep courses that 
surveyed 1800 people in nine state 

47
00:02:52,761 --> 00:02:53,594
university's found that three fourths,
three out of four people cheated on 

48
00:02:57,951 --> 00:03:00,610
exams were written and you can blame 
them too.

49
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:03,730
But the epidemic of cheating in school,
in science,

50
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,460
in sports is something that we're all on
the hook for.

51
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:08,403
And let's never buy into that bullshit 
that I am the only one responsible for 

52
00:03:12,311 --> 00:03:13,144
my actions.
Or you or the only one responsible for 

53
00:03:15,221 --> 00:03:18,310
yours.
We're all responsible for one another in

54
00:03:18,311 --> 00:03:21,280
each active cheating.
We performed a cost benefit analysis.

55
00:03:21,281 --> 00:03:23,920
Think of the 16 year old me taking that 
physics exam.

56
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:27,250
If I get caught,
I may get a bad grade on the test,

57
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:30,040
a call home to my parents or detention.

58
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,220
Detention is nothing,
uh,

59
00:03:32,221 --> 00:03:33,054
call into to my parents sucks,
but they only want me to get good 

60
00:03:34,961 --> 00:03:37,210
grades.
And a bad grade sucks too.

61
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:41,650
But my teachers and my school was what 
my parents wanted for me to succeed.

62
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,513
If I don't get caught,
I'll have successfully bypass work that 

63
00:03:45,011 --> 00:03:45,844
I didn't want to do in the first place.
And I'll have moved further down that 

64
00:03:48,131 --> 00:03:51,550
motivational yellow brick road that 
leads to a good career.

65
00:03:51,551 --> 00:03:53,150
And of course,
uh,

66
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:56,050
or you know,
the upper middleclass version of us,

67
00:03:56,051 --> 00:03:58,030
which is,
I don't know,

68
00:03:58,031 --> 00:03:58,864
a fondue maker,
just watch madmen cheating is an 

69
00:04:00,671 --> 00:04:01,504
activity latent in all nature as a way 
for organisms to gain an advantage 

70
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:05,763
without incurring the costs of effort.
I was reading recently that pseudomonas 

71
00:04:08,711 --> 00:04:09,544
bacteria exploit the goods generated by 
cooperating bacteria without sharing in 

72
00:04:13,751 --> 00:04:14,584
the production.
Those bastards fish cheap primates 

73
00:04:16,931 --> 00:04:18,340
cheat.
We cheat on tests,

74
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:21,430
on diets on the Tour de France,
on spouses,

75
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:23,440
uh,
but there's the rub.

76
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:27,340
Infidelity is a kind of cheating that 
it's impossible for us to justify,

77
00:04:27,341 --> 00:04:28,174
right?
Because it's the abuse of relationships 

78
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:30,963
for personal gain.
It's easy for us to feel why it's wrong 

79
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,713
to exploit another person,
especially someone so invested in us as 

80
00:04:37,961 --> 00:04:42,130
a significant other for a cheap thrill.
As we move out of the educational system

81
00:04:42,131 --> 00:04:44,650
with it's painfully mistaken 
motivational cues,

82
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:45,663
it becomes clear to us.
It became clear to me that this is the 

83
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:49,054
foundation of all kinds of cheating,
the leveraging of another person for 

84
00:04:52,691 --> 00:04:53,524
personal betterment.
And we all know how levers work as 

85
00:04:56,381 --> 00:04:57,214
someone moves up someone else somewhere,
perhaps by subtle conduits gets pushed 

86
00:05:01,761 --> 00:05:02,710
down.
This I suspect,

87
00:05:02,711 --> 00:05:05,200
is the true meaning of that adage.
Cheaters never win,

88
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,153
even if you get away with it out there,
even if you're not aware of the 

89
00:05:08,861 --> 00:05:09,694
consequences of your actions,
you can never truly get away with it in 

90
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:14,104
here.
But for the sake of honesty and a less 

91
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,460
rainbow sunset,
everything is lovely.

92
00:05:18,461 --> 00:05:23,461
And we'll work out ending to this vlog.
Let me ask you cheater,

93
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:26,260
have you gotten away with it?

94
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:33,340
Not just my work as a.

95
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,650
hi everyone.
Sorry the Vlog is so late this week.

96
00:05:45,651 --> 00:05:46,484
The reason is that I was sent up to 
Boston earlier this week to cover the 

97
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,860
marathon bombing story.
Um,

98
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:54,950
a surreal and unexpected week to be 
sure.

99
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,930
Um,
so thanks for sticking with it.

100
00:05:56,931 --> 00:05:59,900
Hopefully we can get back on schedule 
for next week and,

101
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:02,180
um,
I'll see you next time.
