1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,210
Hey

2
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:11,043
everybody,
so a lot of people out there have been 

3
00:00:11,981 --> 00:00:12,814
asking me about my writing and whether 
or not there's something of mine that 

4
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:17,200
you can read.
Well,

5
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:19,720
today I'm going to be releasing my first
book,

6
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:20,613
Big City,
which I wrote about a year ago on 

7
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:26,710
gumroad.com,
a digital copy for $3.

8
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,660
Now I hope that you think that that's 
fair.

9
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:32,470
I put a lot of work into this and I 
don't think it's so much money where you

10
00:00:32,471 --> 00:00:35,290
know if you don't like the book,
you feel that you've wasted it.

11
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:37,420
Obviously though,
I hope that you do like it.

12
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:42,960
You can find the link for the full text 
in the dupe later today.

13
00:00:43,781 --> 00:00:44,614
I'm going to be reading the first part 
of it for you firstly because I love to 

14
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:49,900
read and listen to fiction.
Secondly,

15
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:54,580
because it'll give you guys a chance to 
see what the book will be like.

16
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:55,563
Now,
just a few words here before I get 

17
00:00:57,191 --> 00:00:58,510
started.
In the way of a summary,

18
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:01,930
imagine that you're reading the back 
flap here in the bookstore.

19
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:03,843
As the title suggests,
the story is about a big city and 

20
00:01:07,091 --> 00:01:07,924
impossibly big city of vast urban sprawl
that goes on and on in every direction 

21
00:01:12,631 --> 00:01:13,464
of city you couldn't possibly see all of
in a lifetime and one in which people 

22
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:18,003
get so easily lost in the confusion of 
streets and high rises and bars and 

23
00:01:23,531 --> 00:01:25,600
moving lights.
It's a science fiction setting,

24
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:26,643
certainly influenced by cyber punk,
but the story is about eight people who 

25
00:01:30,851 --> 00:01:31,684
are trying to live and survive in this 
chaotic mess of a place and who are all 

26
00:01:36,821 --> 00:01:37,654
experiencing this very unique and 
strange phenomenon called seeing the 

27
00:01:43,691 --> 00:01:44,524
whole thing.
Now there is a secret buried in the 

28
00:01:47,721 --> 00:01:48,554
story about what the city is,
what seeing the whole thing means about 

29
00:01:51,671 --> 00:01:53,710
what they're all doing there,
but of course you have to read the whole

30
00:01:53,711 --> 00:01:55,480
thing to find out what that what that 
is.

31
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:58,540
Okay,
so go to a dark place,

32
00:01:58,541 --> 00:01:59,800
getting them,
getting the mood.

33
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,270
Here's the first part of big city called
Mac ludgate.

34
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:08,920
Mac ludgate returned from the 
[inaudible] region,

35
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:09,783
also called coat Malai,
province and sector 22 way without a 

36
00:02:12,941 --> 00:02:13,774
tatter of currency to his name.
He had begun his sojourn to that 

37
00:02:16,421 --> 00:02:18,430
blistery junction of try district 
gambling,

38
00:02:18,431 --> 00:02:21,160
not six months before dreaming of a 
streak,

39
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,030
but all he got was a dark new 
appreciation for settling debts.

40
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:29,200
He picked the scab on his forehead and 
thought this is ready to fall off as the

41
00:02:29,201 --> 00:02:30,034
automated female voice recording spat 
out the name of his home district now 

42
00:02:33,251 --> 00:02:37,120
entering loan and district Taj Zhou 
Province municipal sector 25.

43
00:02:37,121 --> 00:02:37,954
A change here for all silverline.
Tram stores will open on my right and 

44
00:02:41,501 --> 00:02:45,070
again in three alternate languages,
but he was wrong about the scab.

45
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,203
It bled.
Here were the things Mac knew as he 

46
00:02:48,821 --> 00:02:53,050
stepped from the tram into loan n one,
he could stay at Shelly's for as long as

47
00:02:53,051 --> 00:02:56,230
he liked to.
The ice on most of his bets was covered.

48
00:02:56,231 --> 00:02:59,290
He had little to worry about in the way 
of rancorous businessmen.

49
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,930
Three,
he was guaranteed at least one free meal

50
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:02,963
everyday at his uncle Warren's 
restaurant on the corner of 15th and 

51
00:03:05,591 --> 00:03:07,510
Catskill Street,
and four,

52
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,373
there was every chance that Mr Hoy econ 
would hire him back to his old position 

53
00:03:11,531 --> 00:03:15,370
at lm and p.
So long as Hoy con didn't know that mack

54
00:03:15,371 --> 00:03:16,204
was living with his daughter,
he nestled himself into the cocoon of 

55
00:03:18,521 --> 00:03:22,240
these near certainties and use them as a
coat against the unseasonable.

56
00:03:22,241 --> 00:03:23,074
Cold

57
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:25,223
loan and station was empty and they'll 
mac could not recall the time when it 

58
00:03:28,591 --> 00:03:30,720
was otherwise.
The space provoked in him,

59
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,260
the feeling of being only recently 
abandoned by a host of people,

60
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:38,370
strange that anyone would gather here he
said to himself as a rush of hot air,

61
00:03:38,371 --> 00:03:39,204
move through the terminal and at once 
vivified his suspicions with paralyzing 

62
00:03:42,481 --> 00:03:45,180
emphasis,
hints of Phantom Card players,

63
00:03:45,181 --> 00:03:47,970
eyes receding into their sockets.
Rhinestone whores,

64
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,890
toothless,
always smiling,

65
00:03:49,891 --> 00:03:52,500
the flotsam of degeneracy behind every 
corner.

66
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:53,543
He was sure of it.
Mac blinked rapidly to dispel these 

67
00:03:55,951 --> 00:03:59,040
apparitions,
but captured instead the after images of

68
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:03,240
dusty fluorescents that spread light 
through the station all thin and dry,

69
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,310
more ghosts.
They had followed him here.

70
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:07,350
Nerves short circuited.
Oh God.

71
00:04:07,351 --> 00:04:08,184
Six months of uppers withdraw.
His heart raced away and these silly 

72
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,084
tricks of the night,
so affected Max eggshell spirit that he 

73
00:04:14,971 --> 00:04:15,804
ran from loan and station and a boyish 
frenzy fleeing a host of illusory 

74
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:20,634
terrorists.

75
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:23,653
Shelly grave lived on the east side of 
loan end in a triplex behind Jefferson 

76
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,353
Park,
near Uncle Warren's restaurant on 15th 

77
00:04:30,501 --> 00:04:34,640
have a building that small was a rare 
commodity and loan n and rare is still.

78
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:37,430
She and her daughter Lisa occupied the 
whole first floor.

79
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,353
Most of that district's population was 
crammed into the row of towering 

80
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:43,790
apartment blocks that lined the far edge
of town,

81
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:44,624
but shelly had gotten years ago at a low
fixed rent before prices rose 

82
00:04:47,631 --> 00:04:48,464
drastically.
District wide fluctuations of that kind 

83
00:04:50,721 --> 00:04:51,554
were frequent and all sectors of the 
city like when through skyscraper and 

84
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:57,290
streets and unexplainable as a matter of
course.

85
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:58,723
Why this particular rent stayed fixed is
easy enough to puzzle out if you know 

86
00:05:02,631 --> 00:05:05,230
Shelly Mac

87
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,063
knocked on her door,
hasn't hesitantly in a way a man does 

88
00:05:08,591 --> 00:05:09,424
when he is merely trying to prove to 
himself that he was there and did that 

89
00:05:12,551 --> 00:05:13,450
thing.
Really.

90
00:05:13,451 --> 00:05:16,780
He was of two minds,
he needed rest and warm sometime for his

91
00:05:16,781 --> 00:05:17,614
nerves to settle.
This was clear from the episode at the 

92
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:22,330
Tram Station,
but being here bashfully,

93
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,193
knocking like a teenager,
Matt could not help but recognize a 

94
00:05:25,481 --> 00:05:30,040
scene from a story played over and over.
It annoyed him to know what shelly would

95
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:32,680
say when she opened the door,
how he would respond,

96
00:05:32,681 --> 00:05:33,514
where the night would go,
what the next day would bring and so 

97
00:05:35,561 --> 00:05:36,394
forth.
He wanted desperately to deviate from 

98
00:05:37,661 --> 00:05:39,700
this plot,
but it was hopeless.

99
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,593
His character always wanted to deviate 
in the scene to do something impetuous 

100
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:47,440
or dangerous or just plain wrong,
but never did.

101
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:50,410
So shelly opened the door and the story 
played on,

102
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:52,480
look,
a millionaire.

103
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,310
Yeah,
and it's all yours.

104
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,290
He pushed fire.
What's that smell?

105
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,790
Does that fish?
Where did you get fish from?

106
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:00,403
So you expect to come in and what?
She had already botched the practice 

107
00:06:03,201 --> 00:06:05,750
speech.
Jump in bed with this is in your world.

108
00:06:05,751 --> 00:06:07,550
I'm walking around and Mac,
listen to me.

109
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,940
I give my arm for a dose of Xeno.
Got Any,

110
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,580
but he had already spotted traces on the
coffee table,

111
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,593
tiny blue speck,
sprinkled over the smiles of magazine 

112
00:06:16,761 --> 00:06:17,594
cover girls and grocery store coupons.
He turned over an issue of celebrity 

113
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:24,050
health with the famous actress Jocelyn 
Marquette,

114
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:26,780
posing candidly on the cover and there 
it was.

115
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:29,510
The feebly hid porcelain jar.
No data piece.

116
00:06:29,511 --> 00:06:31,850
Spade my,
her daughter Lisa in school.

117
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:34,250
Bingo Mac.
Join me,

118
00:06:34,251 --> 00:06:35,840
will you?
We can yell at each other tomorrow.

119
00:06:35,841 --> 00:06:36,674
I'm deadbeat.
He dropped a small blue tablet into his 

120
00:06:39,231 --> 00:06:40,064
pipe.
One thing he had not lost in Cotana and 

121
00:06:42,081 --> 00:06:43,820
ground it down with the bud of the pen.

122
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:47,990
One long drag and stupidity crashed over
his mind.

123
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,220
Simplicity.
Yes.

124
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,353
The end of all thought.
He passed the pipe to shelly who seemed 

125
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:55,190
to have given up her protests at site of
the drug.

126
00:06:55,191 --> 00:06:56,350
She was thinking,
well,

127
00:06:56,351 --> 00:06:58,880
finish this tomorrow and took a drag for
herself,

128
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,043
a sweet repos.
She nestled herself into the crook of 

129
00:07:02,601 --> 00:07:06,380
his arm and together they sank into the 
red round cushions of the couch.

130
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:10,850
Nothing moved.
The television was tuned to one of those

131
00:07:10,851 --> 00:07:11,684
channels which only plays music probably
because shelly couldn't afford a full 

132
00:07:15,321 --> 00:07:17,360
entertainment package.
The noise was faint,

133
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:18,463
but Mac caught enough to discern which 
channel it was he needed to have heard 

134
00:07:20,931 --> 00:07:21,764
it.
Though shelly only ever played one 

135
00:07:22,941 --> 00:07:23,774
station this late at night,
particularly when she was dosing city 

136
00:07:26,451 --> 00:07:28,130
reflections.
Istation,

137
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:28,993
unlike any other,
it's sole purpose was to catch old 

138
00:07:31,941 --> 00:07:36,290
frequencies that had been broadcast and 
set bouncing into the city sound maze of

139
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:37,370
a trillion buildings.

140
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:38,383
You might hear something on reflections 
that had been played a thousand years 

141
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:43,010
ago in a province you would never know 
the name of,

142
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:45,440
but who could say after all that 
bounding and rebounding,

143
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:49,250
if what you were hearing was the music 
as it was originally recorded,

144
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:52,790
who could say if it was even music,
it might just a well has been,

145
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:56,480
have been modulated.
Police sirens or distressing those maybe

146
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:59,600
the arrhythmic calculations of an 
ancient supercomputer.

147
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,440
It gave people a sense of communion 
anyway.

148
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,333
It helps them forget the size of the 
city or else feel the magnitude and its 

149
00:08:07,971 --> 00:08:11,060
full capacity.
Mack was proud that his district set the

150
00:08:11,061 --> 00:08:15,230
places he had heard of had invented 
something like city reflections.

151
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:18,590
He wondered if other places had it to 
the music,

152
00:08:18,591 --> 00:08:21,890
pulsed over the room,
cautiously like a vessel signaling.

153
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:22,843
It's approach a port in a low fog,
and they allowed that strange melody to 

154
00:08:26,181 --> 00:08:27,014
fuse it's essence with their own,
both of them being so dissatisfied at 

155
00:08:30,351 --> 00:08:33,500
that moment with the state of being 
required by human mind.

156
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:34,693
Molecules mingled with wavelengths were 
twisted and strewn mislaid shuffled 

157
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,370
around,
transmuted and exchanged,

158
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,820
and if afterward only the music remained
so what?

159
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:45,643
The drug was in full effect.
Mac kept raising the volume because his 

160
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:51,290
ears kept adjusting and he wanted it to 
be loud.

161
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,500
What was he trying to death and what?
Scab?

162
00:08:53,501 --> 00:08:56,880
Light question still itched at him under
all that noise?

163
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:58,860
Yes.
His secret.

164
00:08:58,861 --> 00:09:02,580
Wish for shelly not to answer,
he couldn't have been in his right mind.

165
00:09:02,581 --> 00:09:05,640
This was exactly what he wanted and 
being here with her weight on him.

166
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:06,683
Six months of uppers and the knife's 
edge stress knife's edge stress of 

167
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,320
[inaudible] card rooms had set a system 
on a dangerous tempo.

168
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:16,140
What was the motive for going to that 
whole?

169
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,390
He couldn't remember what we didn't want
to,

170
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:24,630
but loan end did that to you.
It was the kind of place that magnetized

171
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:25,464
it's population.

172
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,303
Even the slightest relaxation of purpose
would be enough to persuade an Erin 

173
00:09:29,461 --> 00:09:30,294
traveler that it was time he ought to go
home and it is sometimes said that 

174
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:36,120
wherever alone inborn folk go in their 
lives,

175
00:09:36,121 --> 00:09:40,100
no matter the distance or duration,
they always die in loan end.

176
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,360
Shelly's daughter Lisa awoken by the 
music that could not be loud enough,

177
00:09:45,361 --> 00:09:46,194
trudged into the living room and found 
her mother completely stoned on the 

178
00:09:48,931 --> 00:09:52,170
couch with a man of whom she had only 
the faintest recollection.

179
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:55,020
Lisa knew very little about drugs,
but enough to knew,

180
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,360
know what it looked like when you were 
on them.

181
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,433
Shelly seeing Lisa and her peach colored
pajamas clutching a teddy bear that had 

182
00:10:01,051 --> 00:10:03,600
been patched and repatch dozens of 
times,

183
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:06,060
shot up from the couch and tried to act 
authoritative.

184
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:07,290
Lisa,
why are you up?

185
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:10,280
Do you want some water or do you need 
anything?

186
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,350
I don't mean to yell at you.
The music was loud.

187
00:10:13,351 --> 00:10:16,740
She said I couldn't sleep.
Her eyes were fixed on Mac,

188
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:18,690
who smile,
suggested friendliness,

189
00:10:18,691 --> 00:10:22,410
but she had been fooled by looks before 
she chose to distrust him.

190
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:24,180
Haley said,
remember me?

191
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,840
All she said was,
can you turn it down please?

192
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:29,243
And the little girl walked back to her 
room fainting all the disappointment of 

193
00:10:32,761 --> 00:10:34,350
a mother.
Mac.

194
00:10:34,351 --> 00:10:35,580
You asked,
turn it down.

195
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:36,810
And he did.
Oh,

196
00:10:36,811 --> 00:10:38,970
this is a disaster.
Why don't I let you ruin everything?

197
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,230
Fuck,
fuck.

198
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,153
She knocked the porcelain jar off the 
coffee table and the little blue tablet 

199
00:10:43,421 --> 00:10:44,254
spilled and we're lost in the shaggy 
fibers of the carpet in that very 

200
00:10:47,671 --> 00:10:48,504
moment,
shelley grave swore off Zena friend to 

201
00:10:50,551 --> 00:10:51,384
forever.
So mortified to what she thought her 

202
00:10:52,561 --> 00:10:53,394
daughter thought she was.
But this was her character's nightly 

203
00:10:56,761 --> 00:10:59,760
promise.
And like the other was never to be kept.

204
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:03,150
Please go.
She whispered and left him there.

205
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,520
Instinctively mack went for the tablets 
that had been strewn in the Sylvan Rug,

206
00:11:08,521 --> 00:11:11,130
uh,
tasked that prove more difficult than it

207
00:11:11,131 --> 00:11:11,964
should have.
The drugs still had a strong hold over 

208
00:11:13,021 --> 00:11:13,854
him now instead of no thought ideas came
swarming into his head like beads 

209
00:11:17,311 --> 00:11:20,010
converging again and again on the same 
conclusion.

210
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,353
My reality is on a loop,
never had he felt more sure about 

211
00:11:24,931 --> 00:11:25,764
something than this.
He rewound the day in his head and 

212
00:11:27,301 --> 00:11:28,134
played it over.
He did the same with the previous six 

213
00:11:29,431 --> 00:11:32,970
months and before repeated occurrences 
of the same night this night,

214
00:11:32,971 --> 00:11:36,630
laid out like sardines in a tin and it 
all seems so pathetic.

215
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:40,080
The did he have no control over this sad
circle of events.

216
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:41,123
He looked down at the handful of blue 
tablets and new at once that they were 

217
00:11:44,311 --> 00:11:45,870
the root cause of his problems.

218
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:48,143
He heard it to the kitchen,
desperate to maintain control over his 

219
00:11:49,921 --> 00:11:53,590
mind before the other part,
the stone sucker part could reclaim it.

220
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:54,543
He lifted up the dirty plates in the 
sink and drop the pills into the 

221
00:11:57,461 --> 00:11:58,810
disposal.
Yes,

222
00:11:58,930 --> 00:11:59,763
cut off the supply.
Eliminate the opportunity for desire to 

223
00:12:02,051 --> 00:12:04,600
prey on the weaker self.
No indulgence.

224
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:05,493
He exhaled and out came everything bad,
overcooked fish wafted from the nearby 

225
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:13,300
stovetop.
Mac.

226
00:12:13,301 --> 00:12:15,370
Wondered again,
where did Shelly get fish from?

227
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,860
He was sure that she didn't have the 
money for food.

228
00:12:17,861 --> 00:12:21,580
That rare sense memory set off a tiny 
projector in his head,

229
00:12:21,581 --> 00:12:22,414
a tangled dream of gatherings at his 
uncle Warren's restaurant on catskill 

230
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:25,870
street.
Birthdays,

231
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:26,853
anniversaries is six.
His sister's graduation from the 

232
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,753
University of Praxis,
that dreadful resection after his 

233
00:12:32,321 --> 00:12:33,154
mother's funeral when he drank too much 
and actually accidentally told Mr Hoy 

234
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,960
con that he was fucking his daughter.

235
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,450
She's a tigress bruce.
Real rough,

236
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,343
but watch out for those nails as Shell 
Hoy con fired him on the spot only to 

237
00:12:45,101 --> 00:12:45,934
rehire him a week later,
after many apologies and his promise 

238
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:53,701
that he would break it off with shelly 
forever blaring yellow light the sun.

239
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:56,650
No passing district police or was 
yellow.

240
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:59,800
The municipality detail so fucking hard 
to keep track.

241
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:00,933
Koten was lawless.
Free from that bewildering rainbow of 

242
00:13:04,331 --> 00:13:05,164
authority.
The light there was always the same 

243
00:13:06,641 --> 00:13:08,200
color,
harsh white,

244
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,130
raining like a God over octagonal 
octagonal card tables,

245
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:13,143
concealing the eyes of your opponents 
and turning the heads of emaciated 

246
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:19,090
amateurs like Mac into small,
chalky skulls.

247
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,433
It was also deliberately organize to 
throw you off balance by who the hell 

248
00:13:25,451 --> 00:13:26,284
you knew that going in.
At least there you can really lose 

249
00:13:27,461 --> 00:13:30,370
yourself at least there.
You could piss in the streets,

250
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:33,560
whichever authority it was.
The light broke.

251
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,820
His trans and Mac was suddenly overcome 
with a wild hunger.

252
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,833
He scraped the burnt leftover fish from 
the skillet and slapped it onto a dirty 

253
00:13:41,831 --> 00:13:44,320
plate in the cupboard.
There was a bottle of Bourbon.

254
00:13:44,321 --> 00:13:48,400
Another odd thing to find at Shelly's.
He ate slowly like a beast,

255
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,970
staving off the urge to devour it's 
prize in one great bite.

256
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,360
Fish after all was nothing to sneeze at 
and Bourbon,

257
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:59,530
the life of a king.
His uncle love Berman always had a glass

258
00:13:59,531 --> 00:14:02,050
with dinner.
Maybe she got the gift from Warren,

259
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,670
uh,
the fish for more and as a gift.

260
00:14:03,671 --> 00:14:07,130
But,
and the truth was there

261
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,650
on his plate in his glass,
mocking him.

262
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:14,320
The clever bitch fish every night if she
wanted it,

263
00:14:14,321 --> 00:14:18,520
free alcohol all in exchange for 
turbulent sex and the occasional dose of

264
00:14:18,521 --> 00:14:19,354
Xeno.
He rushed at the thought of all that 

265
00:14:20,501 --> 00:14:23,200
full acid skin perspiring,
greasy.

266
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,780
And what did they say about him in bed 
afterwards?

267
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,940
That he was a joke,
making a fool of himself.

268
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:30,790
Could they guess when he'd returned a 
broken record?

269
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:33,040
That boy he heard it loud and clear in 
the kitchen.

270
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:36,520
Silence no more.
He scrambled into Shelly's bedroom,

271
00:14:36,521 --> 00:14:37,354
found her curled up in a ball under the 
covers and in one vicious motion kicked 

272
00:14:41,771 --> 00:14:44,050
her from the bed.
But the wait was wrong.

273
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:44,973
He felt it immediately to light.
The small body crashed into the far 

274
00:14:48,881 --> 00:14:49,930
wall.
At first,

275
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:54,460
the little girl scream came as if from 
far away and then.

276
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,633
And then it was right there,
cleaving him into shelly found her 

277
00:14:59,241 --> 00:15:01,800
daughter strewn on the floor like a 
ragdoll.

278
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:02,653
The girl's neck had hit the protruding 
window sill and this sent her into 

279
00:15:05,901 --> 00:15:10,190
severe convulsions of bent nerve.
Probably appendages thrashed against the

280
00:15:10,191 --> 00:15:13,400
pho wood paneling.
Quick sonorous studs,

281
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:15,770
Lisa,
Lisa,

282
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,140
she nailed over her daughter.
Completely helpless.

283
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,420
You weren't supposed to touch a seizing 
person,

284
00:15:20,421 --> 00:15:21,920
right?
She couldn't remember.

285
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:24,610
Mack was in shock.
His leg,

286
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:28,280
his legs moved as if by another brain 
slowly out of the room.

287
00:15:28,281 --> 00:15:29,114
His body was taking the necessary steps 
to extricate itself from the 

288
00:15:31,881 --> 00:15:34,460
repercussions of this horrible accident 
and accident.

289
00:15:34,461 --> 00:15:36,710
That's what it was.
Could he be blamed for it?

290
00:15:36,711 --> 00:15:39,440
Really?
Images spilled into his head randomly.

291
00:15:39,441 --> 00:15:42,620
Uncle Warren drinking bourbon from a 
perspiring glass.

292
00:15:42,621 --> 00:15:45,140
The gruff sniggers have better gambler.
Something strange.

293
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,810
The strap,
the scratch on his mothers coffin.

294
00:15:47,811 --> 00:15:48,980
How did it get there?
Oh yes,

295
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:51,350
yes.
There was a rock hidden in the shovel of

296
00:15:51,351 --> 00:15:52,184
dirt.
He was supposed to dump over the casket 

297
00:15:53,341 --> 00:15:54,174
at drew,
a line directly above her knees or her 

298
00:15:55,641 --> 00:15:56,474
shoulders.
He couldn't recall what side the head 

299
00:15:57,891 --> 00:16:01,880
was on,
and Lisa twitching like a broken doll.

300
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:07,040
He found himself in the kitchen again,
standing over the sink.

301
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,830
Lisa seizure was only a faint tapping in
the room.

302
00:16:09,831 --> 00:16:10,664
Beyond Dalen the disposal.
He could see the small pile of blue 

303
00:16:13,521 --> 00:16:16,510
tablets.
Why had he gotten rid of the Xeno?

304
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:17,863
Think of the money.
He was throwing away stupid to throw 

305
00:16:18,981 --> 00:16:21,320
away all that money.
He would need it now.

306
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:22,483
He reached down the tapping ceased 
silence and then city reflection boomed 

307
00:16:27,231 --> 00:16:28,460
from the living room.
Television.

308
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,650
Mac turned around to see who had turned 
it on,

309
00:16:30,651 --> 00:16:34,340
but nobody was there.
A contract auto voice called out strange

310
00:16:34,341 --> 00:16:37,760
lyrics,
the creaking of the tented sky,

311
00:16:37,761 --> 00:16:42,470
the ticking of eternity.
I saw and heard a new atlast the how and

312
00:16:42,471 --> 00:16:43,304
why,
of all things past and present and 

313
00:16:45,681 --> 00:16:47,630
forevermore.
The universe,

314
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:52,780
cliff to the core,
lay open to my probing sense and augury.

315
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:54,973
That's what it felt like.
Had he succeeded in derailing the 

316
00:16:57,801 --> 00:16:59,750
looping story.
Yes.

317
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:00,763
Mac turned around to the sink and was 
startled to see shelley there standing 

318
00:17:03,531 --> 00:17:06,080
before him.
Her face as cold as the night.

319
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:09,920
I'm sorry,
he said or did she say it?

320
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,800
Her finger was flushed on a light 
switch,

321
00:17:12,801 --> 00:17:15,920
but he observed no light turn on or off.
When he flipped it,

322
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,143
moisture on his cheek.
Mack looked down to see his hand being 

323
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:25,250
torn apart by blades,
so swift and sharp that at first he felt

324
00:17:25,251 --> 00:17:30,251
no pain and then the pain came and Mac 
ludgate saw the whole thing.
