1
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:23,510
It's the medium is the message and it 
doesn't matter what we say on TV.

2
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,130
Why are we all here tonight?

3
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:32,980
Why am I asking this question?
There's a huge technology involved in TV

4
00:00:32,981 --> 00:00:33,814
which surrounds you physically handle 
the effect of that huge service 

5
00:00:39,801 --> 00:00:44,801
environment on you personally is vast.
The effect of the program is incidental.

6
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:59,810
The effect of the program is incidental.
The effect of the program is incidental.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,280
The effect of the program is incidental.

8
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:04,293
Marshall Mcluhan's famous saying,
the medium is the message poses 

9
00:01:08,351 --> 00:01:11,290
interesting questions for the age of 
online video.

10
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,393
He gets to the basic point in that clip.
New Forms of media actually reorganize 

11
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:17,763
our consciousness in McLuhan's time.
The great shift in media was from print 

12
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:25,300
to electronic media,
radio and more importantly,

13
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,253
television,
where the printed book was what he 

14
00:01:27,731 --> 00:01:28,564
called hot media and intense.
One way offloading of high definition 

15
00:01:32,201 --> 00:01:35,800
information into your mind.
The TV was cool.

16
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:38,680
It was low definition on in a busy 
house,

17
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:42,250
interrupted by commercials playing to 
all the senses.

18
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:43,383
In other words,
it demanded your participation to fill 

19
00:01:45,641 --> 00:01:46,474
in the gaps,
every kind of media from print to radio 

20
00:01:49,211 --> 00:01:50,530
to music,
to television,

21
00:01:50,531 --> 00:01:51,364
to the internet,
creates a kind of invisible environment 

22
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,170
around us.
When you're watching TV,

23
00:01:56,171 --> 00:01:57,004
you may be aware of the particular show 
of how funny or engaging it is of how 

24
00:02:00,701 --> 00:02:01,534
relatable the characters are,
but rarely do we perceive or step back 

25
00:02:05,171 --> 00:02:08,770
to understand what it actually means to 
watch tv,

26
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:13,450
what it means to be in that audio visual
and immersive sensory environment.

27
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:14,343
It's no surprise that the great triumph 
of television is the triumph of 

28
00:02:17,741 --> 00:02:18,574
advertising,
but what could possibly be more attuned 

29
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:21,693
to the medium of television than 
commercials in 30 seconds or a minute 

30
00:02:25,361 --> 00:02:26,194
they invite or require participation 
triggering each and every one of the 

31
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:31,384
senses.
This is not to say that advertisements 

32
00:02:33,131 --> 00:02:36,490
are good for us,
just good for TV.

33
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:39,460
Just as early television took its cues 
from print,

34
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:40,563
radio,
and film before coming into it's own 

35
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:45,760
online.
Video has taken its cues from tv,

36
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:50,050
but like TV online video is a wholly new
medium,

37
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,010
operating in its own environment.
Reshaping our consciousness.

38
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,083
Again,
I mean just the way we watch is 

39
00:02:57,341 --> 00:02:58,174
different.
We're close up to the screens with the 

40
00:03:00,371 --> 00:03:03,430
screens are small,
often the size of a phone,

41
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:06,490
whereas my hand is rarely on the remote 
control.

42
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:07,563
It's nearly always on the mouse,
inviting different kinds of agencies 

43
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:14,950
like the ease at which you can scan 
through something.

44
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:15,903
All these things,
and I'm sure many more that you could 

45
00:03:17,621 --> 00:03:22,621
identify have effects on the styles that
become widely viewed and adopted,

46
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:28,620
but I think the largest ingredient of 
online video is the awareness that every

47
00:03:29,021 --> 00:03:33,250
consumer is a potential creator.
The appeal of low five,

48
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,113
of making something that anyone could 
potentially produce is extremely 

49
00:03:37,241 --> 00:03:39,520
important to the culture of online 
video.

50
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,533
So much so I'm tempted to say that 
what's considered flawed and imperfect 

51
00:03:44,021 --> 00:03:48,490
videography in the eyes of other media 
is actually essential to online.

52
00:03:48,491 --> 00:03:49,324
Video Mcluhan was fond of saying that 
radio was more suited to packages to 

53
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:54,363
completed products.
While TV had a preoccupation with 

54
00:03:56,951 --> 00:03:59,380
processes to seeing how things were 
done,

55
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:02,770
and I think this extends even further 
with online video.

56
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:07,000
Just take a look at daily Vlogs,
perhaps the form that's most tailored to

57
00:04:07,001 --> 00:04:07,834
the medium of online video,
the process of filming your day of how 

58
00:04:11,441 --> 00:04:12,274
the camera moves is vital to the concept
and there are certainly a number of 

59
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:19,540
other styles that have been proven to be
highly compatible with online video.

60
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:22,330
One that comes to mind is animated 
explainer.

61
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,420
Let's try to make a list of some more in
the comments below.

62
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:26,283
I don't completely agree with Mcluhan 
when he says the effect of the program 

63
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:30,543
is incidental,
but I do think that great valuable 

64
00:04:33,191 --> 00:04:34,024
content for online video has to be 
matched with a style that fits the 

65
00:04:38,201 --> 00:04:39,220
medium.
Of course,

66
00:04:39,221 --> 00:04:40,054
it's still really early in the history 
of this medium in 10 or 20 years with a 

67
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:44,374
better perspective.
We'll be able to look back at all this 

68
00:04:46,181 --> 00:04:50,560
work and point to the first true 
masterpieces of the medium,

69
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,633
but what's exciting now is that those of
us who are working in online video are 

70
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:56,733
in effect creating the form.
We're writing the language of this new 

71
00:05:01,121 --> 00:05:01,954
medium and for that reason,
experimentation and innovation have to 

72
00:05:05,351 --> 00:05:09,490
continue to be a top priority and even 
for those who just watch,

73
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:13,180
it's essential to study this medium as 
it grows,

74
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,073
to be aware of its message and the 
unique environment it creates because 

75
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:19,263
all aspects of the media,
I have an irresistible force when in 

76
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:23,983
design.

77
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,990
Hey guys,
some exciting news.

78
00:05:26,991 --> 00:05:31,970
I have 20 more nerd writer mugs 
available on my patrion page.

79
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:35,630
Learned a lot from the first batch,
but God they came out so great.

80
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,140
So there are $5 and in order to make the
price work,

81
00:05:39,141 --> 00:05:41,840
you'll get them after five videos and 
I'll be watching that.

82
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:45,050
So I do a video a week now so it should,
shouldn't be too long.

83
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,430
Um,
I basically break even.

84
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:49,070
I just want you guys to have them 
because I think they're so cool.

85
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:53,000
Click here anywhere on the mug and you 
can claim them while they last.

86
00:05:53,001 --> 00:05:55,730
The first batch went pretty fast.
Thanks again for watching.

87
00:05:55,731 --> 00:05:57,830
And new video will be out next 
Wednesday.

88
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:00,950
And I'll be in comments to talk about 
this because I want to talk about this a

89
00:06:00,951 --> 00:06:01,784
lot more.
So find me down there and see you next 

90
00:06:03,381 --> 00:06:04,214
time.
