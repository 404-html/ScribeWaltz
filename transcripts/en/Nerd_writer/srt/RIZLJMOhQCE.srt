1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:01,523
Mm,

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:04,773
I'm happy to John with you today in road
go down in history as the greatest 

3
00:00:15,691 --> 00:00:20,100
demonstration for freedom in the history
of our nation,

4
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:21,423
Martin Luther King's I have a dream 
speech is arguably the most important 

5
00:00:24,251 --> 00:00:26,200
and most well known speech of the 20th 
century.

6
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:29,860
It's 1,667
words in 17 minutes long,

7
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:30,723
absolutely riddled with big difficult 
terms and full of rhetorical devices 

8
00:00:34,841 --> 00:00:35,674
that are intentional and practiced.
The speech is everyone knows was 

9
00:00:38,501 --> 00:00:42,280
delivered at the march on Washington in 
1963 and voiced the economic,

10
00:00:42,281 --> 00:00:43,114
political and moral message of civil 
rights to a quarter million people in 

11
00:00:46,931 --> 00:00:51,040
front of the Lincoln memorial onto those
people and the billions who have seen or

12
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:51,874
heard it since king's words in printed 
an image of what black Americans were 

13
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:57,453
fighting for and why fully 100 years 
after Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves 

14
00:01:01,841 --> 00:01:03,340
with the emancipation proclamation

15
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,333
five years ago,
a great American in whose symbolic 

16
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:14,740
shadow we stand today signed the 
emancipation proclamation.

17
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:18,800
The very first line of the speech is 
already doing so much.

18
00:01:18,801 --> 00:01:19,634
The first four words are an illusion to 
Lincoln's Gettysburg address and 

19
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:27,590
instantly recognizable piece of American
rhetoric that in one fell swoop,

20
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:30,290
links America's founding,
which Lincoln spoke of,

21
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,393
and the civil war when he spoke with the
fight for civil rights throughout the 

22
00:01:34,911 --> 00:01:35,744
speech.
King takes great pains to make links 

23
00:01:37,371 --> 00:01:38,204
like this.
It's important for him to frame civil 

24
00:01:39,531 --> 00:01:40,364
rights as a chapter in the larger 
American mythology so that those who 

25
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:45,404
identify with that mythology might 
incorporate this struggle into that 

26
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:49,510
story

27
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,170
on a,
on a bill of rights,

28
00:01:51,171 --> 00:01:52,580
of life,
liberty,

29
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,280
and the pursuit of happiness,

30
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,880
but there's even more to see in this 
first line.

31
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:02,080
One of the things that makes king's 
words so memorable is their musicality.

32
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,033
Here he uses a literation,
five words starting with the letter s 

33
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,760
that draw you along the sentence like a 
tune that's catchy.

34
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:10,653
Alliteration helps a phrase stick in the
mind and king returns to it again and 

35
00:02:14,261 --> 00:02:15,340
again.
In this speech,

36
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:18,140
dark and desolate.
It's sweltering,

37
00:02:18,141 --> 00:02:20,790
some out of the Negroes,
legitimate discontent,

38
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,960
the marvelous new militancy,
trials and tribulations,

39
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,000
dignity and discipline.
In a sense,

40
00:02:27,001 --> 00:02:30,900
we've come to our nation's capital to 
cash a check.

41
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,680
This isn't the only rhythmically aware 
or musical feature of I have a dream.

42
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,350
There's another rhetorical device called
Anaphora,

43
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,213
which can use is even more than 
alliteration and Africa is the 

44
00:02:41,491 --> 00:02:45,270
repetition of a word or phrase at the 
beginning of success of sentences,

45
00:02:45,271 --> 00:02:48,150
something that in writing would be 
redundant,

46
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:52,620
but in speech is an effective tool for 
emphasis and I have a dream.

47
00:02:52,621 --> 00:02:55,590
Martin Luther King uses an Afro as an 
emphasizing tool,

48
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,453
but also as an organizing device.
Listen to how phrases sketch the larger 

49
00:03:00,911 --> 00:03:03,640
ideas of the speech.
Almost like an outline,

50
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,810
but 100 years,
100 years,

51
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:09,220
100 years,
100 years later,

52
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:12,260
we refused.
We refused to believe.

53
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,880
Now is the time.
Now is the power.

54
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:18,860
We can never be satisfied.
We can never be satisfied.

55
00:03:18,861 --> 00:03:22,080
We cannot be satisfied.
We can never be satisfied.

56
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,210
I have a dream.
I have a dream.

57
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:26,880
I have a dream.

58
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,170
Freedom.
Freedom,

59
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,290
freedom,
freedom ring.

60
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:32,230
Let Freedom Ring.

61
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:36,510
The speech goes from the past to the 
present to the future of civil rights,

62
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:41,780
and it's threaded with a refusal to 
settle for anything other than the ideal

63
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:42,653
of freedom and equality.
I think this is a key to martin luther 

64
00:03:44,971 --> 00:03:48,330
king's rhetorical genius,
drawing from his Gospel roots.

65
00:03:48,331 --> 00:03:49,164
He not only uses alliteration and 
Anaphora even illusion for dramatic 

66
00:03:52,831 --> 00:03:53,664
effect,
but also to help the audience grasp of 

67
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:58,950
the structure and remember the nuance of
his message.

68
00:03:59,160 --> 00:03:59,993
King knows that for example,
you may not know this line from 

69
00:04:01,891 --> 00:04:02,620
Shakespeare

70
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:07,620
that was the winter of our discontent,
made glorious suburb by this sun appeal,

71
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:14,120
but the phrase will ring familiar,
sweltering,

72
00:04:14,121 --> 00:04:14,954
some out of the Negroes,
legitimate discontent will not pass 

73
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:19,003
until that is an invigorating autumn of 
freedom and equality king shifts the 

74
00:04:23,031 --> 00:04:23,811
seasons,
of course,

75
00:04:23,811 --> 00:04:25,760
because for those who live in the 
American south,

76
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:26,623
autumn is more relieving than summer.
Know your audience and sticking with 

77
00:04:29,391 --> 00:04:30,224
this paragraph for just a moment,
notice that this sentence of 

78
00:04:32,211 --> 00:04:37,180
shakespearian poetry is couched in a 
point about urgency and not settling and

79
00:04:37,181 --> 00:04:41,180
the king isn't all flowery language.
He draws that image of paradise.

80
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:42,014
Then follows it with a sentence that 
contains three easy to understand 

81
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:45,733
cliches,

82
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:46,703
oh,
so that the Negro needed to blow off 

83
00:04:48,811 --> 00:04:53,760
steam and will now be content,
will have a rude awakening if the nation

84
00:04:53,761 --> 00:04:55,830
returns to business as usual.

85
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:56,913
This mixing of plain and slash or neat 
language is I think a microcosm of what 

86
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:03,760
occurs in the entire speech after 
alluding to the Gettysburg address.

87
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:07,330
In the declaration of Independence King 
Compares the promises of those documents

88
00:05:07,331 --> 00:05:09,160
to a bad check.

89
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:12,620
I'll check which has come back marked 
insufficient funds.

90
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:16,660
You're invoking the plane realities of 
police brutality for whites only,

91
00:05:16,661 --> 00:05:19,540
signs and voter suppression.
He paraphrases

92
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,473
Bible.
We will not be satisfied until justice 

93
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:27,290
rolls down like waters and righteousness
like a mighty stream.

94
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,393
The first half of the speech describes 
in large part the issue at hand what is 

95
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,910
to be done and demanded what is to be 
avoided,

96
00:05:33,911 --> 00:05:34,744
and he tells those who have suffered to 
hold fast and believe while the final 

97
00:05:38,531 --> 00:05:41,410
part,
which was famously improvised by King on

98
00:05:41,411 --> 00:05:44,620
the spot,
rises into the heights of dreams

99
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,023
I have shall be exalted.
Every hill and mountain shall be made 

100
00:05:52,431 --> 00:05:54,320
low.
The rough places will be made.

101
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,213
Wayne and the crooked places will be 
made straight and the Lord shall be 

102
00:05:59,121 --> 00:06:02,240
revealed and all smashed shall see it 
together.

103
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:05,180
In my video analyzing Donald Trump's 
speech,

104
00:06:05,181 --> 00:06:06,014
I talked about how he was able to 
connect with people by using simple 

105
00:06:09,351 --> 00:06:10,184
language.
It's a good general rule for public 

106
00:06:11,751 --> 00:06:12,584
speaking.
When you're addressing a large diverse 

107
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,104
audience,
the most important part of rhetoric is 

108
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,833
being understood.
Trump does this by keeping his words 

109
00:06:20,121 --> 00:06:20,954
basic and emotional and it works,
but I think Martin Luther King offers a 

110
00:06:25,431 --> 00:06:26,264
counterexample of public speaking,
one that's more complex and layered in 

111
00:06:29,781 --> 00:06:30,614
language and structure,
but still just as easily understandable 

112
00:06:33,741 --> 00:06:38,060
as anything that current politicians or 
speaker say and I have a dream.

113
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,740
The simple language contextualizes and 
grounds the poetic and the poetic,

114
00:06:42,741 --> 00:06:43,574
elevates and animates the simple.
That's why it echoes across time and 

115
00:06:48,501 --> 00:06:53,501
will echo for decades and ages to come 
something vital and alive.

116
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:59,660
We won't be able to feed children,
black men and white men,

117
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,413
Jews and gentiles,
Protestants and Catholics will be able 

118
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:06,524
to join hands and sing.
In the words of the old Negro spiritual 

119
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,890
free at last,
free at last.

120
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:22,660
Hey everybody.

121
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:23,493
Thanks for watching and thank you to the
great courses plus for sponsoring this 

122
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:28,960
episode.
If you love learning for fun,

123
00:07:28,961 --> 00:07:29,794
which I do have the great courses.
Plus is it subscription on demand video 

124
00:07:32,441 --> 00:07:35,170
learning service.
It's got 7,000

125
00:07:35,171 --> 00:07:39,210
online lecture series from some Great 
Ivy League and other professors.

126
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,233
Um,
something that really sort of meshes 

127
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:42,124
with what I was just talking about as a 
great course by John mcwhorter from 

128
00:07:44,861 --> 00:07:48,100
Columbia about the usage of the English 
language,

129
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:49,303
the myths about it.
And it goes into some of these things 

130
00:07:52,451 --> 00:07:53,284
about oratory that I obviously am 
totally fascinated by because I think 

131
00:07:56,831 --> 00:07:57,664
it's sort of organizes the world anyway.
If you go to the great courses 

132
00:08:00,131 --> 00:08:01,480
plus.com/nerd
writer,

133
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,314
you can get a 30 day free trial if you 
use the offer code nerdwriter I think 

134
00:08:05,261 --> 00:08:06,094
it's 1499 after that.
It's a really cool service if you just 

135
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:11,380
like to learn things,
which I do.

136
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:15,220
Thank you guys so much for watching.
I will see all of you.

137
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:17,650
Not next Wednesday,
but I'll be in Boston for neurocognitive

138
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,690
Vitoria with the link and description 
below.

139
00:08:19,691 --> 00:08:21,100
If you're in Boston,
come say hi.
