1
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:06,423
Come on,
you mentioned to me this is the sacred 

2
00:00:36,401 --> 00:00:41,401
lake.
This is my spot for me to read.

3
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:47,410
Can't tell you the number of books have 
right here.

4
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:51,500
Hm.
Oh my God.

5
00:00:51,501 --> 00:00:55,390
It's freezing.
Absolutely.

6
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,233
With a couple of children.
I think it would pull it out and 

7
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:38,490
everything.
I know myself and we've been good.

8
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,860
We haven't done anything to be ashamed 
of and it's a good thing.

9
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:45,000
I want to be good.
Okay.

10
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:50,890
It would be pretty cool to design a film
studies course around,

11
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:51,813
call me by your name.
The movie opens up its own interesting 

12
00:01:54,131 --> 00:01:58,870
lane in film history,
populated by auteurs trying to disappear

13
00:01:58,871 --> 00:02:02,050
from their work,
which is a paradox worth exploring.

14
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:03,910
The movies that this class would 
feature.

15
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,190
A handful of which you just saw in the 
opening sequence,

16
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,293
have similarities that are focused by 
call me by your name and by director 

17
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:11,703
Luca Quad Nino's vision.
It's not that quite an Nino quotes or 

18
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:19,030
pays homage to his influences.
He does something that's much harder.

19
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,033
He actually learns the lessons that 
these influences teach and applies them 

20
00:02:23,531 --> 00:02:25,840
in a way that adds to his personal 
style.

21
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:34,540
The most obvious influence I think are 
the films of James Ivory specifically to

22
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:37,360
have his elm forester adaptations,
a room with a view,

23
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:42,700
and Morris I say obvious because ivory 
was in his late eighties.

24
00:02:42,701 --> 00:02:44,880
No less the screenwriter for call me by 
your name.

25
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:49,690
The market has a long career at the 
merchant ivory production company is all

26
00:02:49,691 --> 00:02:52,530
over this movie now you might not know 
merchant tie for you.

27
00:02:52,531 --> 00:02:53,380
The director,
producer,

28
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:56,500
team of ivory and his life partner is 
mile merchant,

29
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:58,600
but along with their screenwriter,
ruth,

30
00:02:58,601 --> 00:03:01,630
Joe Vala,
they created 44 films together,

31
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:02,870
fun,
highbrow,

32
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:03,823
literary adaptations,
period pieces with lavish costumes and 

33
00:03:06,951 --> 00:03:07,784
sets,
and this may sound like stuffy pump is 

34
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:13,100
filmmaking,
but the merchant ivory films or anything

35
00:03:13,101 --> 00:03:18,101
but they leave with life room with a 
view.

36
00:03:22,841 --> 00:03:23,674
For example,
nature is a symbol of freedom against 

37
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:29,590
the social restrictions of the Gordian 
England ivory,

38
00:03:29,591 --> 00:03:30,424
like Wat a Nino captures the warm 
tactile qualities of being outdoors and 

39
00:03:34,901 --> 00:03:35,734
uses the sense memory that these images 
and sounds evoke as a way to trigger 

40
00:03:39,521 --> 00:03:41,200
empathy for the characters

41
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,493
in both films.
The desire for summer afternoons is 

42
00:03:45,051 --> 00:03:48,230
paralleled with the desire for love or 
sex

43
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:53,020
in Morris and adaptation of foresters,
novel of homosexual love.

44
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:54,123
The similarities are more apparent,
the important ways that both Morris and 

45
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:02,790
Leo tentatively realized and act upon 
their feelings are physical,

46
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,173
not verbal,
and this is what a good filmmaker and 

47
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:10,870
good actors bring to an adaptation.
The translation dialogue into gesture.

48
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:12,203
Sure.
A second key influence are the films of 

49
00:04:17,511 --> 00:04:18,344
Eric Rohmer,
the last of the French new wave 

50
00:04:20,121 --> 00:04:24,980
directors who style was less 
iconoclastic than Godard or truffaut,

51
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,113
yet whose career sustained in quality 
much longer than many of his 

52
00:04:29,151 --> 00:04:29,984
contemporaries.
Romero is known as a very wordy 

53
00:04:32,061 --> 00:04:32,894
filmmaker.
His movies feature characters having 

54
00:04:34,581 --> 00:04:38,240
extended philosophical conversations on 
love and desire.

55
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:41,390
Yet what Gwadar Nino draws from him is 
his simplicity,

56
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:42,463
his unsentimental presentation of 
characters in space and his camera work 

57
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,100
like the genre Anwar,
who came before him.

58
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,053
Romana is interested in realism,
but not at the expense of beauty like 

59
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,090
roamers and renoirs squat.

60
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:56,923
A Nino's camera in call me by your name 
isn't showy and his editing isn't 

61
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,393
manipulative.
Quad Nino and a cinematographer only 

62
00:05:03,531 --> 00:05:04,364
used one lens,
a 35 millimeter to mimic roughly the 

63
00:05:07,461 --> 00:05:11,120
feel of human eyesight and the camera 
follows the action,

64
00:05:11,121 --> 00:05:14,360
but in the way and observer might in all
of these filmmakers,

65
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:17,690
long takes,
don't feel stylized or distracting.

66
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:18,763
They function as a window into the 
environment and it's important that we 

67
00:05:21,711 --> 00:05:24,590
see that environment.
This space is these characters inhabit,

68
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:29,240
so depth of field is usually deep and 
the use of closeups is rare.

69
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,133
As Ramiro once said,
the reason I don't like a close up is 

70
00:05:32,121 --> 00:05:34,730
because it excludes,
it doesn't add,

71
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,593
it takes away.
It suppresses the relationship of the 

72
00:05:37,581 --> 00:05:40,530
character to the set,
and what's important for Guantanamo,

73
00:05:40,531 --> 00:05:45,531
Nino is that he gives the actors enough 
room and time for the space between them

74
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,450
to become charged with emotion.

75
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,873
Finally,
maybe the most important influence on 

76
00:05:51,201 --> 00:05:54,290
the structure of call me by your name is
the French director.

77
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,153
Maurice Plr,
especially his film I s'mores law is 

78
00:05:58,761 --> 00:05:59,594
another figure on the outer rim of the 
French new wave who barely has any 

79
00:06:03,051 --> 00:06:07,220
recognition in America.
His films are rough and unsentimental to

80
00:06:07,221 --> 00:06:09,920
the extreme,
even sloppy at times,

81
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,113
but the brim with a wild energy,
they're driven by people who are slaves 

82
00:06:14,991 --> 00:06:15,824
to impulse and what Quad Nino admires 
about plr is how these impulses drive 

83
00:06:20,211 --> 00:06:24,770
the construction of the narrative.
It's almost dizzying how a no s'mores,

84
00:06:24,771 --> 00:06:25,604
for example,
a coming of age film about a sexually 

85
00:06:26,961 --> 00:06:27,794
charged adolescent trips from scene to 
scene without consideration for a 

86
00:06:31,341 --> 00:06:32,174
traditional story arc that cut between 
two shots could represent a jump of two 

87
00:06:35,601 --> 00:06:40,601
seconds or two months and the audience 
isn't prepare for either when to call me

88
00:06:41,091 --> 00:06:41,924
by your name isn't as extreme as this,
but gotten dino's narrative follows a 

89
00:06:44,781 --> 00:06:45,614
similar rhythm where the through line 
isn't the developments of a three act 

90
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:49,573
plot,
but rather the energy of Elios desire 

91
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,270
and how that manifests.

92
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,183
These unusual structures are so 
important because narrative art is one 

93
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:03,551
of the ways in which we model our own 
lives and there can be falseness in what

94
00:07:04,701 --> 00:07:05,534
is sometimes called Hollywood films that
influences our expectations of 

95
00:07:09,861 --> 00:07:11,420
experience.
For instance,

96
00:07:11,421 --> 00:07:13,220
the whole time I was watching call me by
your name.

97
00:07:13,221 --> 00:07:14,054
I was anxious for the person or the 
institution that would inevitably 

98
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,433
challenge Elio and Oliver is affair.
It's something I'd come to expect in 

99
00:07:21,711 --> 00:07:22,544
films and stories of this kind,
but when that didn't happen and I 

100
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:26,623
released that pent up energy,
it was a revolutionary feeling like the 

101
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:34,380
film was opening up a new corner of life
differently to see things,

102
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:36,383
see without my eyes first time that you 
don't have to understand these films or 

103
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,500
these directors to enjoy.
Call me by your name.

104
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:47,783
In fact,
this lineage is built around the notion 

105
00:07:50,221 --> 00:07:55,080
that you can have a radical effect on 
viewers without a radical style.

106
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,000
I think why Denino's sin,
Ophelia?

107
00:07:57,001 --> 00:07:57,834
His love of films is the very best kind.
It doesn't exclude people for not being 

108
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:02,903
in the know.
It brings influences together in the 

109
00:08:05,941 --> 00:08:09,520
service of a brand new style to 
appreciate it.

110
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:21,180
