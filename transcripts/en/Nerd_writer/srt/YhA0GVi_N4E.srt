1
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:17,570
The first piece of art that I was 
intensely interested in,

2
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:22,130
the first thing that affected me so 
powerful that I was driven to understand

3
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:23,423
why sweeping epic about the Lord of 
dreams that started me on a path that's 

4
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:33,510
led to here dream or Morphea says he's 
most commonly called in the series,

5
00:00:33,511 --> 00:00:36,150
has done the same for a lot of people.
Indeed,

6
00:00:36,151 --> 00:00:36,984
when game and made his lead character,
the personification and master of 

7
00:00:39,961 --> 00:00:43,290
dreams,
he played on both meanings of the word,

8
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,330
the visions we have one asleep and the 
wishes that consume us when awake.

9
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:51,840
There is so much to explore and Sandman 
and I may do more on this,

10
00:00:51,841 --> 00:00:52,674
but today I want to zero in on the 
unique place that William Shakespeare 

11
00:00:56,101 --> 00:00:56,934
has in the series and how his presence 
helps game and communicate some themes 

12
00:01:00,511 --> 00:01:01,344
about writing dreams and genius.
Shakespeare makes three appearances in 

13
00:01:06,511 --> 00:01:07,344
San man's 75 issues the first time we 
see them as toward the beginning of the 

14
00:01:10,801 --> 00:01:11,634
series in the context of another 
person's story dream and his sister 

15
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,553
death make an agreement in a 14th 
century tavern when they overhear a man 

16
00:01:19,981 --> 00:01:20,520
saying that.

17
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,090
The only reason people die is because 
everyone does it.

18
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:25,403
Death agrees not to take this man hub 
gasoline until he desires it and dream 

19
00:01:30,001 --> 00:01:30,834
agrees to meet him in the same bar once 
every hundred years to discuss how he's 

20
00:01:35,071 --> 00:01:39,360
feeling on their second meeting in 15,
89 dream and hop over here,

21
00:01:39,361 --> 00:01:43,410
a man name will shack spurred pining to 
his friend and fellow playwright,

22
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,513
Kit Marlowe about his great wish to give
men dreams that would live on after I'm 

23
00:01:49,201 --> 00:01:51,360
dead.
So dream strikes,

24
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:52,194
another bargain with him,
the details of which we learn on their 

25
00:01:55,231 --> 00:01:58,200
second meeting.
This time on the south downs of Sussex,

26
00:01:58,201 --> 00:01:59,034
England,
where Shakespeare traveling with a 

27
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,173
troupe of players is preparing his new 
play of midsummer night's dream display 

28
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,263
we learned was written for dream one of 
two plays about dreams in exchange for 

29
00:02:10,561 --> 00:02:11,394
Shakespeare becoming the figure we know 
today the vessel for the great stories 

30
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:16,283
of mankind,
Shakespeare's troop are enticed to 

31
00:02:18,121 --> 00:02:22,830
perform for the real inhabitants of 
fairy were visiting the earthly realm at

32
00:02:22,831 --> 00:02:23,940
dreams invitation.

33
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:24,803
Perhaps for the last time in the process
of this story which takes place toward 

34
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:33,120
the middle of the series.
Dream begins to question if he was right

35
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:37,680
for giving shakespeare what he wanted.
He did not understand the cost.

36
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,390
He says,
mortals never do.

37
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,450
They only see the prize,
their heart's desire,

38
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,553
their dream,
but the price of getting what you want 

39
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,273
is getting what you once wanted.
Here we begin to see the purpose behind 

40
00:02:51,241 --> 00:02:56,241
Shakespeare's inclusion in this series 
through Shakespeare and analog for dream

41
00:02:56,791 --> 00:03:01,720
and Gaiman himself.
We get a meditation not only on genius,

42
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,140
but on the cost of genius.
The for gaming.

43
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:08,770
That cost is isolation,
isolation of all forms.

44
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:10,860
In this issue,
we meet him,

45
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:11,823
Shakespeare son,
Shakespeare seems to regard him as a 

46
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:17,410
nuisance and Hamnett laments to another 
actor.

47
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,753
He's very distant.
He doesn't seem like he's really there 

48
00:03:21,131 --> 00:03:22,240
anymore.
Not really.

49
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,770
It's like he's somewhere else.

50
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:26,620
Anything that happens,
he just make stories out of it.

51
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:30,310
I'm less real than any of the characters
in his place.

52
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:31,443
In his eagerness to write great stories.
Shakespeare becomes isolated from his 

53
00:03:35,141 --> 00:03:39,850
family and his life,
such as the cost of extreme focus,

54
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:45,280
but works of genius also become isolated
from their context.

55
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,533
At the intermission of the play,
dream breaks the news to Shakespeare 

56
00:03:49,001 --> 00:03:52,360
that his friend Christopher Marlowe has 
been killed.

57
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:53,563
The timing is no accident here.
The rise of Shakespeare beginning with 

58
00:03:56,711 --> 00:03:57,544
plays like a midsummer night's dream 
signaled the disappearance of his 

59
00:04:01,001 --> 00:04:01,834
contemporaries like Christopher Marlowe 
from the historical record in modern 

60
00:04:05,711 --> 00:04:07,930
cultural memory.
Barring academia,

61
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:08,883
their presence has been overshadowed by 
isolated genius game and picks up this 

62
00:04:13,571 --> 00:04:16,780
theme again in the final appearance of 
Shakespeare in Sandman,

63
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:21,070
which is also not accidentally the final
issue of the series.

64
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:24,070
Here Shakespeare is writing his final 
play,

65
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,980
the tempest,
the second play at the end of his career

66
00:04:26,981 --> 00:04:29,110
that fulfills his bargain with dream.

67
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,513
His friend and sometimes critic Ben 
Johnson comes to visit him and asks 

68
00:04:33,671 --> 00:04:34,504
about the new play.
Have you been rating poor Holland shed 

69
00:04:36,971 --> 00:04:37,804
again,
or does plutarch's bear the brunt of 

70
00:04:39,251 --> 00:04:40,084
your depredations?
This of course references the fact that 

71
00:04:42,461 --> 00:04:43,294
Shakespeare famously took many of his 
plots from prior sources and histories 

72
00:04:46,991 --> 00:04:49,850
like those of Rafael Holland shed and 
plutarch.

73
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,183
Yet these sources like small planets 
like Christopher Marlowe and Ben 

74
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,833
Johnson,
do not register against the massive 

75
00:04:57,611 --> 00:04:59,440
star.
That is Shakespeare.

76
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:04,150
An example,
back in the first issue in 1789 at their

77
00:05:04,151 --> 00:05:04,984
fourth meeting,
Hob gambling tells dream he has seen a 

78
00:05:07,961 --> 00:05:12,961
production of King Lear mentioning the 
idiots have given it a happy ending that

79
00:05:13,961 --> 00:05:14,794
will not last dream says the great 
stories will always return to their 

80
00:05:18,101 --> 00:05:21,700
original forms.
Here Gaiman is playing with us.

81
00:05:21,701 --> 00:05:25,390
He knows what the average man epitomized
by hop gatling does,

82
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:28,720
not that it was shakespeare who changed 
the ending.

83
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:33,580
The original versions on which lear was 
base did have a happy ending,

84
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:34,443
but those versions are for God,
and yet by having dreams say the great 

85
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:41,470
stories will always return to their 
original forms.

86
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:45,670
Gaming indicates perhaps the key theme 
of the whole series,

87
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:50,970
the power of dreams to supplant reality.
In the second issue,

88
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:51,993
Oberon King of fairy watches 
Shakespeare's play about himself and 

89
00:05:55,691 --> 00:05:58,460
says to dream what but things never 
happened.

90
00:05:58,461 --> 00:06:01,730
Thus,
dream responds apropos of this theme,

91
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:05,360
things need not have happened to be 
true.

92
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:06,703
Tales and dreams are the shadow truths 
that will endure when mere facts are 

93
00:06:11,451 --> 00:06:12,284
dust and ashes and forgot.
The very next panel features the line 

94
00:06:16,311 --> 00:06:20,300
from a midsummer night's dream that 
criticizes the power of stories,

95
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:25,780
the best in this kind or but shadows 
gaming like Shakespeare disagrees,

96
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:29,780
the shadows,
these illusions of reality incomplete as

97
00:06:29,781 --> 00:06:33,560
they are may come in time to replace the
real thing.

98
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:38,030
Indeed,
Shakespeare was the vessel for extremely

99
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:41,360
powerful stories.
His treatments of culture,

100
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:46,390
of love and madness in many ways created
the age we still live in.

101
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:52,390
We are all in a very real sense living 
in the dreams of Shakespeare.

102
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:54,643
Sandman is a singular work of art coming
and propelling comics into a higher 

103
00:06:58,940 --> 00:06:59,773
literary appreciation and pulling like 
Shakespeare's work on a vast catalog of 

104
00:07:04,131 --> 00:07:07,040
mythological,
religious and literary references.

105
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:11,210
It's fitting that gaming is more 
interested in Shakespeare,

106
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:15,470
the man that his work Shakespeare dream 
and game and like I said,

107
00:07:15,471 --> 00:07:16,304
are all analogs for one another and each
in their turn have to examine the costs 

108
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:24,980
of telling great stories.
The largest part of that cost,

109
00:07:24,981 --> 00:07:25,814
it seems is isolation.
I watched my life as if it were 

110
00:07:29,661 --> 00:07:30,494
happening to someone else.
Shakespeare tell street my son died and 

111
00:07:33,801 --> 00:07:34,634
I was hurt,
but I watched my hurt and even relished 

112
00:07:38,421 --> 00:07:41,510
it a little for now,
I could write a real death,

113
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,890
a true loss in three issues that span 
the series.

114
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:46,723
Neil gaiman treats these themes of 
genius and isolation within a larger 

115
00:07:50,421 --> 00:07:54,320
framework of a story that is essentially
about stories.

116
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:59,730
The inclusion of Shakespeare highlights 
the uneasy relationship between stories,

117
00:07:59,751 --> 00:08:02,210
collective dreams,
and those who create them.

118
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:03,613
History and imagination,
amend Shakespeare to fit their purposes 

119
00:08:06,831 --> 00:08:07,664
just as Gaiman does,
by bringing him to life in the pages of 

120
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:11,114
Sandman and game and imagines him 
isolated from his own life as history 

121
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,440
has isolated him above his time and 
place even as we make our work,

122
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:26,540
our work makes us and it can obliterate 
us to.

123
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:30,620
In other words,
dreams really do

124
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,170
come true.

125
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:41,183
Hey everybody,
thanks for watching and welcome to 

126
00:08:42,691 --> 00:08:46,140
everybody who is new to the nerd writer 
that inside out video.

127
00:08:46,141 --> 00:08:49,260
I can't believe so many people watched 
that.

128
00:08:49,261 --> 00:08:51,990
That was just an awesome experience last
week,

129
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,760
but this is a great example of the kind 
of stuff we do here.

130
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:56,613
The nerd writer,
we take art and culture and science and 

131
00:08:58,801 --> 00:08:59,634
politics and explore them and go in 
depth and put ideas to work and that's 

132
00:09:03,721 --> 00:09:07,740
what this is all about.
And the channel is made possible by your

133
00:09:07,741 --> 00:09:12,180
pledges on my Patrion page right here,
this little as a dollar per video,

134
00:09:12,181 --> 00:09:13,014
you know,
the money that you guys give me goes 

135
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:16,930
directly into these videos,
um,

136
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,810
and to,
toward improving the channel.

137
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:22,200
And that is really what I want to do is 
push this medium farther,

138
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,910
you know,
create new styles,

139
00:09:23,911 --> 00:09:26,040
new ways of exploring and explaining 
ideas.

140
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,320
And there's a lot more than I want to 
do.

141
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,213
This was awesome.
I've been thinking about how to analyze 

142
00:09:30,661 --> 00:09:32,790
comics for a long time.
Hope you enjoyed it.

143
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:33,683
And anyway,
thank you again and welcome to the nerd 

144
00:09:35,941 --> 00:09:37,200
writer.
We have a lot of fun here.

145
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,480
Um,
I will see you guys next Wednesday.
