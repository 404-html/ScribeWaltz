1
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:15,390
There's no painting in the history of 
the forum,

2
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:20,420
more worthy of analysis then Diego 
Velasquez,

3
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:21,693
Las Meninas,
what we're talking about here is a 

4
00:00:23,801 --> 00:00:27,010
master work by an artist late in his 
life,

5
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:31,330
but at the height of his powers 
determined to drive into this canvas,

6
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:35,860
the sum total of his talent,
his experience and his intellect.

7
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,120
Velasquez had been by then a court 
painter for the Spanish King Phillip,

8
00:00:40,121 --> 00:00:42,990
the fourth for over 30 years.
Indeed,

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,990
he was a favorite of Philips painting 
his portrait many times and advancing in

10
00:00:46,991 --> 00:00:50,680
salary and rank all the way up to 
chamberlain of the palace,

11
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:51,693
responsible for decorating this great 
Alcazar of Madrid with all its many 

12
00:00:55,391 --> 00:00:56,224
artworks.
So it's no surprise that for his 

13
00:00:57,881 --> 00:00:58,714
masterpiece,
Velasquez sets his painting in the 

14
00:01:00,911 --> 00:01:03,400
palace itself,
the place he knew best,

15
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,473
specifically in his own studio,
adorned with paintings that he himself 

16
00:01:07,961 --> 00:01:10,270
chose.
Now they're a little bit hard to see,

17
00:01:10,271 --> 00:01:11,104
but we know what they are based on 
histories of the space and it's no 

18
00:01:14,111 --> 00:01:17,560
accident that he chooses these paintings
specifically,

19
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,120
but we'll get to that a bit later.

20
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,313
First,
let's take a look at the main action of 

21
00:01:21,911 --> 00:01:24,820
the scene.
So much hits you right away.

22
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:27,790
Maybe the first thing you see is the 
little girl,

23
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:31,480
Margaret Teresa,
then only living child of the king,

24
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:32,583
or maybe you see that mirror showing 
reflected images of the king and queen 

25
00:01:35,771 --> 00:01:38,530
themselves,
or maybe the first thing that stands out

26
00:01:38,531 --> 00:01:39,364
to you is that six of the nine 
characters represented here are staring 

27
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:44,043
beyond the picture plane,
which is to say at you that fact alone 

28
00:01:48,131 --> 00:01:51,760
gives this image.
It's great sense of spontaneity as if it

29
00:01:51,761 --> 00:01:52,594
were Snapshot Velasquez captures the 
moment just when several of these 

30
00:01:56,651 --> 00:02:01,330
figures are noticing something,
some like these three have yet to notice

31
00:02:01,331 --> 00:02:02,950
it.
In the case of the little princess,

32
00:02:02,951 --> 00:02:03,784
all that's moved so far is her eyes,
but though the moment depicted is 

33
00:02:08,171 --> 00:02:09,004
spontaneous,
the composition of the subjects is 

34
00:02:11,771 --> 00:02:12,604
anything,
but you have here a real clinic in 

35
00:02:14,771 --> 00:02:16,750
composing group scenes.

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,420
What Velasquez has done in this group of
11,

37
00:02:19,421 --> 00:02:21,520
including the mirror images of the king 
queen.

38
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:22,693
This arranged an extraordinary number of
links and contrasts that slides your 

39
00:02:27,641 --> 00:02:31,750
eyes back and forth across the canvas.
The first thing to notice perhaps is the

40
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:35,290
obsession here with grouping twos and 
threes,

41
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:36,573
everyone here,
but the princess can be split into 

42
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,423
pairs.
The male and female dwarf the two 

43
00:02:41,951 --> 00:02:42,784
chaperones here,
the curtsying made and the palace 

44
00:02:45,461 --> 00:02:49,120
official in the back corridor,
the king and the queen in the mirror and

45
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:52,570
Velasquez and the maid kneeling to offer
the princess a drink.

46
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:53,763
Notice also that these are all male 
female pairs and these pairings 

47
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:00,940
accentuate the princess as the focus of 
the scene,

48
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,180
but you could also split the group up 
into threes.

49
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:09,540
The princess with her two maids,
that dog and the two dwarves and the two

50
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:14,300
palace officials with what now occurs to
us are mirrored couples,

51
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,393
so you also that these two groups of 
three internally made up of doubles and 

52
00:03:18,551 --> 00:03:21,760
triples are all on the same horizontal 
plane.

53
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,073
This group of six also draws the 
entirety of the paintings three 

54
00:03:26,171 --> 00:03:27,004
dimensional space.
Our eye is drawn from Velasquez and the 

55
00:03:29,951 --> 00:03:30,784
foreground to the palace official and 
the distance as they're wearing similar 

56
00:03:33,911 --> 00:03:37,300
black garb and stand in line with the 
two doorways on the back walls.

57
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,583
The chaperones in the middle ground 
linked to the king and Queen in the 

58
00:03:40,781 --> 00:03:41,614
background,
which simultaneously brings the z axis 

59
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,080
all the way forward beyond the picture 
itself,

60
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:50,110
intimating a depth that we can't even 
see.

61
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,810
It's amazing.
What you might not have realized is that

62
00:03:52,811 --> 00:03:53,644
this motif of twos and threes has 
already been established in the frames 

63
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,053
on the back wall with two giant canvases
overtop to doorframes and the central 

64
00:04:02,801 --> 00:04:03,634
mirror of that bottom triple the right 
sides of the frames correspond with the 

65
00:04:07,391 --> 00:04:08,224
princess and her two maids moving the 
eyes naturally from the king and queen 

66
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:13,323
to their daughter,
but the eyes are also drawn from the 

67
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:17,650
mirror to the right.

68
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,890
That lighted passage framing the palace 
official.

69
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,083
The space of this light and rectangle is
equal to that of the mirror and they're 

70
00:04:25,301 --> 00:04:27,610
put on the same horizontal plane as 
well.

71
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,350
Indeed,
because of its brightness,

72
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:32,890
like the brightness of the little 
princess bathed in light,

73
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,560
we're drawn to it just as much as the 
other two.

74
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:41,250
In these three elements of Las Meninas,
we have three central focus points.

75
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:44,500
Unlike da Vinci's last supper,
for example,

76
00:04:44,501 --> 00:04:48,040
were all elements in the painting point 
toward Jesus Christ.

77
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:48,903
Las Meninas is more ambiguous letting 
the viewer vacillate between multiple 

78
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:54,243
centers of weight.
Being a court painter for the royal 

79
00:04:56,261 --> 00:04:58,900
family.
It's obvious why Velasquez would want to

80
00:04:58,901 --> 00:05:01,570
highlight the royal couple and their 
daughter,

81
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:05,020
but what's significant about the back 
hallway?

82
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:07,810
Well,
this gets it a long running debate about

83
00:05:07,811 --> 00:05:12,811
the significance of this mirror.
What exactly is it reflecting?

84
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,333
A number of critics have seen it as the 
reflection of the actual king and queen 

85
00:05:18,221 --> 00:05:19,420
standing,
like we said,

86
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:20,283
beyond the picture plane,
putting the viewer literally in the 

87
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:23,614
shoes of royalty,
but a closer examination of the one 

88
00:05:27,071 --> 00:05:31,210
point perspective of this image reveals 
something else.

89
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:35,140
The vanishing point of Las Meninas is 
not here,

90
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,520
but here in the lighted doorway to the 
right.

91
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:41,350
What does this mean?
Well,

92
00:05:41,351 --> 00:05:43,510
it means that the.
I have this painting,

93
00:05:43,511 --> 00:05:45,760
so to speak,
isn't opposite the mirror.

94
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:47,530
What?
Opposite the door,

95
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:50,950
so the mirror doesn't reflect directly 
back at us.

96
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:51,933
It reflects at an angle,
an angle that puts its image on another 

97
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,583
unseen aspect of meninas.
The canvas that Velasquez is working on 

98
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:02,953
now for a moment,
let's get back to the paintings in the 

99
00:06:04,491 --> 00:06:05,324
upper half of this picture.
These are copies of two paintings by 

100
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,690
Peter Paul Rubens,
a hero of Alaska's,

101
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:14,120
and they tell similar stories in this 
case,

102
00:06:14,121 --> 00:06:17,540
both from ovid's metamorphosis in the 
right,

103
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:18,374
the mortal Marcias challenges the god 
Apollo to a flute plane contest in the 

104
00:06:22,671 --> 00:06:25,250
Left,
the Goddess Athena challenges the mortal

105
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:28,820
Arachni to a weaving contest.
In other words,

106
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:34,090
these are two contests between mortals 
and God's on the subject of the arts,

107
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,953
Marcias loses and Arachni winds,
but both are punished by their gods in 

108
00:06:39,861 --> 00:06:40,694
the end,
for failing to recognize the divine 

109
00:06:42,501 --> 00:06:44,810
source of the artistic endeavor.

110
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:49,760
Such stories are extremely relevant to 
las meninas because in the end,

111
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:52,850
this is a painting about painting 
itself.

112
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:56,570
In Velasquez is time.
Painting still didn't hold the same kind

113
00:06:56,571 --> 00:07:01,571
of noble place as poetry and music.
Las meninas in all it's splendid effects

114
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:06,770
is a vigorous argument for the virtue of
painting,

115
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:12,100
whether it comes from the heavens or 
from the lifelong practice of craft,

116
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,890
and this gets at the heart of the 
mirror.

117
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:19,010
The vanishing point and the multiple 
centers of Focus,

118
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:24,170
see what my art can do for Alaska is 
saying to the viewer and to his king and

119
00:07:24,171 --> 00:07:25,004
Queen,
look not to nature or your own 

120
00:07:27,201 --> 00:07:31,070
reflection in the mirror for the most 
marvelous depiction of your image,

121
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:32,323
but to my canvas,
las meninas is an extraordinary 

122
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:40,640
accomplishment for its time,
but its effect is timeless.

123
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,770
It said that King Phillip,
the fourth,

124
00:07:42,771 --> 00:07:46,580
often came to Alaska as a studio just to
watch him paint.

125
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:47,983
Somehow I think las meninas animated his
consciousness as it does mine 360 years 

126
00:07:54,261 --> 00:07:55,094
later.
Indeed to stare at this painting in any 

127
00:07:58,341 --> 00:08:02,990
age is to be convinced slowly,
gradually,

128
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:08,620
and then confidently that you are 
witnessing the very best this medium has

129
00:08:10,581 --> 00:08:11,414
to offer.

130
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,103
Hey everybody,
thanks for watching and thank you to 

131
00:08:18,101 --> 00:08:21,430
squarespace for sponsoring this video.
Just amazing.

132
00:08:21,431 --> 00:08:22,264
Like those of you who pledge on Patrion 
squarespace's helping to fund this 

133
00:08:25,451 --> 00:08:26,284
project,
keep it going and they don't interfere 

134
00:08:27,971 --> 00:08:29,260
in the content,
which is awesome.

135
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:30,263
Um,
and the product is actually really 

136
00:08:30,821 --> 00:08:31,631
great,
sleek,

137
00:08:31,631 --> 00:08:32,464
intuitive,
professional looking websites and you 

138
00:08:34,571 --> 00:08:36,220
don't have to know coding to make it 
happen.

139
00:08:36,221 --> 00:08:38,080
I'm working on something for the nerd 
writer right now,

140
00:08:38,081 --> 00:08:39,340
which I think is going to be pretty 
cool.

141
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,410
Um,
and if you sign up for a year,

142
00:08:41,411 --> 00:08:45,520
you can get a free domain name and if 
you go to squarespace.com

143
00:08:45,521 --> 00:08:46,354
and use the offer code nerdwriter,
you can get 10 percent off your first 

144
00:08:49,631 --> 00:08:50,770
purchase.
So that's pretty awesome.

145
00:08:50,771 --> 00:08:53,680
You can find the link to all that stuff 
in the description below.

146
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:56,290
Thank you guys for that.
And if you want to pledge to the project

147
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:57,124
directly,
you can obviously go to my patrion by 

148

Thank you guys so much and I will see 

149
00:09:00,821 --> 00:09:02,250
you next time.
