1
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:04,070
If Jonathan winters was never accused of
anything,

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:05,263
he's got the perfect alibi.
He was someone else at the time when I 

3
00:00:09,171 --> 00:00:10,004
first saw him before the show,
and he was still trying to decide 

4
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:15,830
whether he could be a drunken Eskimo,
the queen of the Vikings,

5
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,740
or a door knob.
I'd read it.

6
00:00:18,741 --> 00:00:19,574
He came out to begin with because when 
he's johnny winter cannot be in the 

7
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,580
wild,
wild man,

8
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:26,980
my friend Jonathan with

9
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,290
in my opinion,
it's impossible to understand the genius

10
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,153
of the late Robin Williams without first
understanding the corresponding genius 

11
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:42,460
of his idol.
Jonathan winters.

12
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:43,323
Winters was the master of 
improvisational comedy from the early 

13
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:50,950
days of TV in his standup and various 
sketch appearances on talk shows.

14
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:55,240
What he did was never scripted.
The characters he invented.

15
00:00:55,241 --> 00:00:59,560
The scenes he enacted were plucked from 
the air in front of his eyes.

16
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,230
The kids had some candy and nation that 
did that.

17
00:01:02,231 --> 00:01:03,064
They come to the river.
There's a barrier here and we will get 

18
00:01:05,631 --> 00:01:08,410
some pictures of the bear.
The bear ate together,

19
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:14,240
but we got some wonderful backdrop.
One of winters,

20
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:19,350
most famous and simplest bits was called
the stick from the Jack Paar.

21
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:24,670
What can you do a routine with you?
Give them anything.

22
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,750
Why am I went to a pretty good cash when
I grind time,

23
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:40,950
Margaret bloody dogs just up there,
just this side of the green trailers.

24
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:55,463
Seven years later,
another comedian did a very similar 

25
00:01:58,171 --> 00:02:02,010
routine with a Pashmina on inside the 
actor's studio.

26
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,390
I came to Bombay.

27
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:05,783
Yeah,

28
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,610
we are going to cook octopus football.

29
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:22,710
Williams and Jonathan winters were 
kindred spirits.

30
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,110
They work together for the first time on
the TV show.

31
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,153
Mork and mindy winters played his son,
from which point they remained great 

32
00:02:29,911 --> 00:02:34,350
friends until winters death in 2013,
only a year and change it.

33
00:02:34,351 --> 00:02:35,184
Turns out before Robin Williams took his
own life in this clip from a 60 minutes 

34
00:02:38,341 --> 00:02:39,174
profile on winters,
it's Robin Williams who expresses the 

35
00:02:42,241 --> 00:02:43,074
great lesson that his mentor taught him.
What was indeed the great philosophy of 

36
00:02:47,131 --> 00:02:48,000
both their comedians.

37
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:52,600
Jonathan has just taught me about the 
world is open for play,

38
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:57,900
is that anything and everybody is 
marketable in a wonderful way.

39
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:00,130
This,
that the world

40
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,780
is open for play.
It's an extremely rich one.

41
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:04,803
It suggests rightly that humanity and 
our shared reality is made up of fluid 

42
00:03:09,431 --> 00:03:10,264
elements of language and social 
structures which are sometimes codified 

43
00:03:13,811 --> 00:03:14,644
into rules and pressures and laws,
but that even the most rigid feature of 

44
00:03:18,881 --> 00:03:23,881
what man makes can be turned flexible 
again and malleable again and funny with

45
00:03:24,281 --> 00:03:25,114
play winters and Williams saw reality 
for its basic elements and felt a grand 

46
00:03:29,681 --> 00:03:30,514
freedom in their work to rearrange those
elements into hilarious parodies of our 

47
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:35,810
world.
Gosh,

48
00:03:35,811 --> 00:03:40,811
I was so taken with this guy.
I was when I first first met him and I'm

49
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,770
working Monday.
We we did.

50
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,410
We had a marvelous time.
Your good days,

51
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:51,080
you had access to more medication and 
will

52
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,333
williams exceeded.
Even the master was in his dramatic 

53
00:03:55,551 --> 00:03:56,384
scope.
Not only could he create exaggerations 

54
00:03:57,891 --> 00:03:58,724
of character in his comedy,
but he had the ability to reproduce the 

55
00:04:01,161 --> 00:04:03,380
subtleties of character as well.

56
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:08,590
Feeling like God put an angel on earth 
for you to rescue you from the depths of

57
00:04:09,531 --> 00:04:12,610
hell when you wouldn't know what it's 
like to be arranged,

58
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:16,520
to have that love for her to be there 
forever.

59
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:20,370
In the end,
both talents reflect the same empathetic

60
00:04:20,371 --> 00:04:21,204
observation of people,
winters and Williams like no one else 

61
00:04:24,271 --> 00:04:29,271
before or since understood the 
stereotypes in subtlety and the subtlety

62
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:33,600
and exaggeration.
It may seem as if this sublime energy of

63
00:04:33,601 --> 00:04:38,100
play passes away with them,
but of course the opposite is true.

64
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:43,050
We have that energy for all time because
they gave it to us,

65
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:44,543
reverend angel,
my hands or our credit because you can 

66
00:04:46,651 --> 00:04:47,484
tell,
but I just consider him not as hands 

67
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,950
anymore,
but his paws.

68
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,050
And be ready to do this.
Get a little cat tree.

69
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,980
Don't be afraid.
Don't be afraid.

70
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:59,430
My hands on your head now,
but they're in my hands.

71
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,880
Why would you put your hand on my head?
Because that's not the America.

72
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,000
Go with me to work with.
Work with my demon spirit.

73
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,570
Bobby.
Get the extra hands straight out.

74
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:13,710
Straight out.
Now you can serve things.

75
00:05:13,711 --> 00:05:14,670
Go table 14.
Able.

76
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:16,920
Oh Man,
I can't get them back that way.

77
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,800
How do you get them back for it?
Look horrible.

78
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:23,280
This is called [inaudible] Syndrome.
A tendency to be in a box for no reason,

79
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:26,720
for horrible long periods and of to walk
against the wind when there is no win.

80
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,400
Why don't you please help a as a 
terrible thing to waste?

81
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:35,630
You're really saying,
not me as a terrible look at this.

82
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,230
This also means surrender.
So,

83
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,880
so basically the Egyptian army training 
course.

84
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:39,661
Okay,
ready?

85
00:05:39,661 --> 00:05:43,090
Drop gun again.
One time that I've done.

86
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:48,730
Okay,
gotten all this money.
