1
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:02,303
It's everything is ours.
We don't have cell coverage is grounded 

2
00:00:10,741 --> 00:00:14,460
into a double play that set this up.
I told him it was a family discussion.

3
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:18,250
I don't think you should sell it all.
I'm telling you.

4
00:00:18,251 --> 00:00:21,900
I expect you to get so upset about.
I am upset about it.

5
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:24,813
One thing I think film can do really 
well better than any other medium is 

6
00:00:27,811 --> 00:00:30,960
capture the reality of conversations in 
a book.

7
00:00:30,961 --> 00:00:31,794
No matter how you lay it out,
one piece of dialogue always has to 

8
00:00:34,261 --> 00:00:35,094
follow another.
You can't simulate people talking over 

9
00:00:37,501 --> 00:00:38,334
each other,
which is what we all do a lot of the 

10
00:00:40,111 --> 00:00:42,600
time and you can't really capture the 
rhythm,

11
00:00:42,601 --> 00:00:43,434
speed and tone that a conversation has.
Even radio and theater miss some of the 

12
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:50,430
nuances that film is perfectly suited to
reproduce.

13
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,190
Told us he was in the hospital this 
morning via text.

14
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:59,210
They were saying we want to information 
of all the filmmakers working right now.

15
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:02,543
I think Noah bombeck maybe has the best 
ear for dialogue as it really is an an 

16
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:08,503
eras what it takes because there's a 
general disconnect between what we all 

17
00:01:11,941 --> 00:01:15,120
sound like and what movie and TV 
character sound like,

18
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:15,983
especially the most articulate ones.
You asked me that question and then my 

19
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:20,124
world came apart and she came here and I
landed in the tabloids and I got death 

20
00:01:23,281 --> 00:01:27,570
threats and my job is constantly in 
jeopardy and you ruined my life again.

21
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:32,490
Just that of course you don't have to 
aim at realistic speech.

22
00:01:32,491 --> 00:01:36,630
Screenwriters like Aaron Sorkin and 
Quintin Tarantino have done really great

23
00:01:36,631 --> 00:01:39,780
work by writing human dialogue as it 
could be,

24
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,130
finding music and language the same way 
that Shakespeare did centuries ago,

25
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:46,340
but bomb back.
On the other hand,

26
00:01:46,341 --> 00:01:48,800
it seems to be committed to a different 
principal.

27
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:49,860
You know,
I think I mentioned to you,

28
00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:51,120
I left the company.

29
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,250
I was with him in a couple of other 
people,

30
00:01:53,251 --> 00:01:56,820
started our own firm.
It was scary in a big change,

31
00:01:56,821 --> 00:01:58,980
but things have settled and we're doing 
really well.

32
00:01:59,010 --> 00:01:59,843
Maureen is talking to a friend about 
getting someone to come up and review 

33
00:02:03,511 --> 00:02:06,420
the show for in recent years have 
essentially been ignored.

34
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:12,270
Some of the back on the map is our logo 
because $35 for a steak.

35
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:17,680
I think a conversation like this speaks 
volumes in one sense.

36
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:20,640
Just by looking at it,
you can see that this is a total failure

37
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:24,630
of communication between father and son.
The two men are on parallel tracks.

38
00:02:24,631 --> 00:02:25,464
Matt is talking about his new business 
and Harold is talking about his 

39
00:02:28,531 --> 00:02:29,364
forthcoming art retrospective,
but in another sense what makes this 

40
00:02:32,191 --> 00:02:34,500
exchange so heartbreaking and true to 
life,

41
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:35,363
at least for me,
is that they really are communicating 

42
00:02:37,561 --> 00:02:39,780
with each other just not explicitly.

43
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:43,350
Matt brings up a major life change and 
expresses some of the hopes and fears he

44
00:02:43,351 --> 00:02:46,020
has about it,
and his father immediately brings up his

45
00:02:46,021 --> 00:02:49,380
own major life event and some of the 
hopes and fears he has about that.

46
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:52,800
Implicitly,
Matt is asking for approval.

47
00:02:52,801 --> 00:02:56,190
He's asking for reassurance and he's 
asking for constellation.

48
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,600
Harold,
on the other hand,

49
00:02:57,601 --> 00:02:58,434
is denying approval because he bear his 
son being more successful than he is 

50
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,553
while asking for reassurance of his own 
hopes and constellation for his own 

51
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:07,054
fears and it's like the two men are 
firing a volley of missiles at each 

52
00:03:09,821 --> 00:03:11,230
other.
Some are hitting,

53
00:03:11,231 --> 00:03:14,230
some are missing,
and some are crashing into each other in

54
00:03:14,231 --> 00:03:15,064
mid air.
I think bombeck understands a key 

55
00:03:17,201 --> 00:03:20,890
dynamic in conversations,
especially conversations with family.

56
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,113
When we speak to others,
we're often speaking to ourselves 

57
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:25,743
attempting to frame dialogue so that the
person we're talking to will reflect 

58
00:03:29,261 --> 00:03:32,230
back the things that we want to believe 
about us.

59
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,273
When I was younger,
I was so invested in his grievances is 

60
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,740
anger the world.
They were mine too,

61
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:43,150
but now that I live 3000 miles away and 
have my own kid thriving business,

62
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:46,660
I don't even get angry at him anymore.
It's even just funny.

63
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,673
I'm sure a lot of people who just went 
home for Thanksgiving experienced 

64
00:03:50,101 --> 00:03:52,750
something like this.
You feel that you've changed,

65
00:03:52,751 --> 00:03:53,584
that you have an updated nuanced idea of
yourself and you're going to show that 

66
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:58,460
idea in one way or another to your 
family

67
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,143
how much money I make you make me feel 
like a piece of shit because you don't 

68
00:04:04,781 --> 00:04:05,614
care about it,
but to also actually do really obsessed 

69
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,710
with it.
You know that I beat you.

70
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:14,750
The thing

71
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:15,583
we seem to forget is that as we're 
trying to get our family to affirm our 

72
00:04:18,501 --> 00:04:19,334
sense of self are doing the same thing 
to us and the result is often conflict 

73
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:28,070
or a conversation that just goes nowhere
or maybe not nowhere.

74
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:31,730
Just not where you intended.
That says you started your own company.

75
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,790
Yeah,
a couple of other guys and you just tell

76
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:35,624
you boss like I want to start with.
I was one of the partners so I didn't 

77
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,250
have a boss.
I understand.

78
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:42,410
So you got a better offer?
No,

79
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,360
there were no offers.
That's what was so scary.

80
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:47,540
We were creating our own opportunity 
because you wanted something smaller,

81
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,450
bigger.
This is my favorite scene in the movie.

82
00:04:50,451 --> 00:04:51,284
It's a minute and 32nd long take of two 
half brothers attempting to connect by 

83
00:04:55,521 --> 00:04:58,220
making it one take.
You get all the elements of conversation

84
00:04:58,221 --> 00:05:01,130
that I spoke about before,
including the body language,

85
00:05:01,131 --> 00:05:03,920
the projected self confidence of matt 
and the nervous,

86
00:05:03,921 --> 00:05:07,880
insecure energy of Danny always nodding 
his head like his father.

87
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:10,160
They're doing this thing where they 
agree.

88
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,113
Well also disagreeing.
It's a specific kind of non argument 

89
00:05:13,821 --> 00:05:17,120
that tells you a lot about their 
personalities and their relationship.

90
00:05:17,121 --> 00:05:19,700
Many of the firms clients came with us,
which was surprising.

91
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:21,200
No,
we expect it.

92
00:05:21,201 --> 00:05:22,910
We can't legally ask clients to come 
with us.

93
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:26,300
They don't have much choice.
It's totally their choice.

94
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,220
No,
I know because you have their money.

95
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:29,413
Okay.
There's so much going on here on one 

96
00:05:30,771 --> 00:05:31,604
level of Danny is trying to connect with
matt by literally trying to finish his 

97
00:05:34,911 --> 00:05:35,744
sentences.
He was also trying to challenge him and 

98
00:05:37,401 --> 00:05:40,460
assert some dominance by acting like he 
knows what Matt's going to say.

99
00:05:40,461 --> 00:05:42,710
Next,
talk about speaking to yourself.

100
00:05:42,711 --> 00:05:47,310
Danny is effectively trying to hijack 
matt sentences and make them his own and

101
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:49,220
listen for this.
The next time you're in a conversation,

102
00:05:49,221 --> 00:05:50,780
people do this all the time.

103
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:51,643
Well,
their monies with the firm that their 

104
00:05:52,431 --> 00:05:57,040
money is in investments.
I bought Ptolemy lives across the street

105
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,330
and I lived across the street.
Dad told me about your.

106
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:03,230
Karen is like,
you can arbitrage.

107
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:06,870
Yeah.
That's not what I do at this point,

108
00:06:06,871 --> 00:06:10,440
Matt and Danny or getting sick,
which actually makes it appropriate that

109
00:06:10,441 --> 00:06:11,274
Danny brings up arbitrage and investment
term for when the same asset is worth 

110
00:06:14,971 --> 00:06:15,804
different values in different places and
you exploit that price difference for 

111
00:06:19,201 --> 00:06:20,034
profit.
Exploiting differences in value is a 

112
00:06:22,171 --> 00:06:23,004
pretty good definition of what it's like
to be in a dysfunctional family or a 

113
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:27,810
dysfunctional conversation for them 
matter.

114
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:28,703
It's all him.
He said that the system is rigged from 

115
00:06:31,011 --> 00:06:33,830
the inside.
That's not entirely true.

116
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,500
Oh,
mostly so this is an exciting time.

117
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:38,620
Boy.
Good.

118
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:42,170
Victoria and I are having some problems.
I never met her.

119
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,880
Karen and I separated.

120
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,010
I know.
I just said I was sorry.

121
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:48,970
Did you?
I'm sorry to and there it is.

122
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:49,863
A moment of connection.
One Minute and 13 seconds into the 

123
00:06:52,301 --> 00:06:53,134
conversation in the Meyerowitz family,
moments of connection are few and far 

124
00:06:55,901 --> 00:06:57,520
between,
so when they happen,

125
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:58,383
they land with a special poignancy and 
know this family has perhaps more 

126
00:07:01,811 --> 00:07:04,090
intense,
more insecure than most.

127
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:05,043
I hope there's something that rings so 
true about this to me when we talk so 

128
00:07:09,071 --> 00:07:11,230
often,
we fly around each other,

129
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,780
working at our own shit,
thinking about ourselves.

130
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:18,280
We try to make our meaning clear,
but we can't quite say what we want,

131
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:20,350
how we want,
when we want.

132
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:21,653
That's because communication isn't easy.
Sometimes movies make it seem like it 

133
00:07:26,351 --> 00:07:27,184
is,
but Noah Baumbach isn't interested in 

134
00:07:29,231 --> 00:07:30,064
that kind of dialogue.
He uses the medium best suited for 

135
00:07:32,831 --> 00:07:35,740
depicting conversations to show us the 
truth about that,

136
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:40,960
that we miss the mark more often than 
hit it and that it's a beautiful,

137
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:45,060
meaningful thing when we do what.

138
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,553
One of the questions I get asked the 
most by far is what kind of software do 

139
00:07:57,141 --> 00:07:57,974
I use to make these videos to edit?
I use final cut pro 10 and since 10 is 

140
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:03,590
so different from the programs that came
before it.

141
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:04,573
I actually depended a lot on online 
videos to teach me the new features and 

142
00:08:08,001 --> 00:08:08,834
these days you can pretty much teach 
yourself anything this way and 

143
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:11,663
skillshare is the perfect way to do it.
Skillshare is an online learning 

144
00:08:15,051 --> 00:08:18,080
community for creators with more than 
16,000

145
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:20,090
classes in graphic design,
animation,

146
00:08:20,091 --> 00:08:21,980
web development,
video game design,

147
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,023
and more.
All the classes are professional and 

148
