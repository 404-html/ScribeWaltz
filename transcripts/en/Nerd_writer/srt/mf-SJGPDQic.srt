1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:03,600
Okay,
just got back from getting my hair cut.

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:05,490
I thought I should probably tell you 
this before we start the blog.

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,030
Just had two shots of rum with my Greek 
barber.

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:10,080
He,
um,

5
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:13,500
took the shots,
took the shots before the haircut,

6
00:00:13,501 --> 00:00:18,501
so he had those scissors up by my ears.
Coffee on a Tuesday and block 37,

7
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:38,470
three d movies,
please just stop making them.

8
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:39,374
So last week the new judge dredd movie 
came out and I was excited because it 

9
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:44,960
looked like the old faithful fair of 
gratuitous,

10
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:45,794
slow motion violence and explosions.
And the 1995 one with stallone is bowel 

11
00:00:49,631 --> 00:00:50,464
scene.
So I was ready to fandango some ticks 

12
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:55,423
when my friend and general sad news,
Susan Elias told me that it was only 

13
00:00:58,341 --> 00:00:59,174
showing in three days,
only three d surely there has to be a 

14
00:01:01,761 --> 00:01:03,230
two d showing somewhere.

15
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:05,843
So I think it's probably a good time to 
talk about why I don't like the 

16
00:01:08,731 --> 00:01:12,240
troubling new trend of three d movies.
I saw Avatar in three d,

17
00:01:12,241 --> 00:01:14,790
I saw coraline in three d,
but I had to.

18
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,673
I had to cut it off there because for 
both of those movies it was like after 

19
00:01:18,841 --> 00:01:23,841
45 minutes of finger started pushing 
into the center of my forehead.

20
00:01:23,911 --> 00:01:26,280
Maybe this happens to you too,
and if it does,

21
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:30,510
I can tell you there is a good reason 
and it has to do with evolution.

22
00:01:30,511 --> 00:01:32,400
So when we look at something,
anything,

23
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:35,370
there are a few things that are 
happening with our eyes first,

24
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,233
like a camera.
Your eyes are focusing at a certain 

25
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:39,900
distance.
You can imagine.

26
00:01:39,901 --> 00:01:43,530
Focus is sort of like a flat plane 
that's moving away from you,

27
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:46,440
depending on what you're looking at.
Second and unlike a camera,

28
00:01:46,441 --> 00:01:50,370
your eyes are converging on a point,
the object of your gaze.

29
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,353
This convergence is the third point in a
triangle in which the other two points 

30
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:56,490
are your eyes

31
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:58,773
triangle.
For the hundreds of thousands of years 

32
00:02:00,101 --> 00:02:00,934
that humans have been pottering around 
and for the many more millions of years 

33
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:04,563
in the history of eyes.
The focus point and the convergence 

34
00:02:06,761 --> 00:02:07,594
point have always been the same.
But when you're sitting in a theater 

35
00:02:09,581 --> 00:02:11,680
watching a three d movie,
things are a bit different.

36
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:16,540
The focus point always remains the same.
Always say 60 feet where the screen is,

37
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:19,000
but the convergence point is always 
changing.

38
00:02:19,001 --> 00:02:20,560
Depending on what the director wants you
to see,

39
00:02:20,561 --> 00:02:23,980
the image might be 30 feet away,
it might be 100 feet away.

40
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,590
It's variable.
Now we can do this,

41
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:31,240
but it takes our brains a few more 
milliseconds to adjust to the change.

42
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:35,260
This is why editing in three d films is 
a little bit slower than normal.

43
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:36,123
As Walter Emerge,
the legendary film editor and sound 

44
00:02:37,811 --> 00:02:38,644
designer says,
the CPU of our perceptual brain has to 

45
00:02:40,601 --> 00:02:41,434
work extra hard,
which is why after 20 minutes or so 

46
00:02:43,271 --> 00:02:44,104
people get headaches,
they're doing something that's 600 

47
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,030
million years of evolution,
never prepared them for.

48
00:02:49,031 --> 00:02:51,790
So if you're getting headaches in three 
d films,

49
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,290
it's not your fault.
It's Charles Darwin's fault.

50
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,281
No,
no wait.

51
00:02:56,281 --> 00:02:58,140
For years I've been decrying three d 
movies,

52
00:02:58,141 --> 00:03:02,170
not because of the serious and seemingly
insurmountable focus convergence issue,

53
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:05,740
but because I think that they perpetuate
a false equivalency.

54
00:03:05,741 --> 00:03:10,180
I've never seen physical or illusory 
immersiveness is the ruler of what makes

55
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:11,043
an immersive movie.
Some of my favorite d movies are pretty 

56
00:03:13,871 --> 00:03:14,704
three dimensional in their own right and
nothing in those ever pops out of the 

57
00:03:17,951 --> 00:03:18,784
screen.
And this applies to gratuitous action 

58
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:21,580
movies too.
I mean,

59
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,460
in order to catch him,
he must become him.

60
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:37,010
Huge scissors cutting by my ears.
And I was like his 30th cut at the day.

61
00:03:40,571 --> 00:03:45,280
So yeah.
