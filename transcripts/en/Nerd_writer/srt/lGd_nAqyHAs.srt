1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:06,230
Coffee on a Tuesday in 27.

2
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,180
Okay,
so if you're like me,

3
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,750
it wasn't or it won't be until the last 
semester of college.

4
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:25,130
Undergrad when you really catch the bug 
of learning and there must be a thousand

5
00:00:25,131 --> 00:00:25,964
reasons for this.
Belated development reasons which are 

6
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:28,303
universal and so forgivable.
The most conspicuous being that high 

7
00:00:30,861 --> 00:00:35,480
school literally rips it out of you in 
favor of a more relevant apparatus.

8
00:00:35,481 --> 00:00:38,660
That is a system for navigating social 
relationships.

9
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:41,450
In other words,
a system for how to be cool.

10
00:00:41,451 --> 00:00:43,010
I'm not totally sure that it's a bad 
thing.

11
00:00:43,011 --> 00:00:43,844
This development of a social aptitude.
I actually think that there is such a 

12
00:00:46,581 --> 00:00:47,414
thing as cool and I would define a cool 
person as someone who engages others 

13
00:00:50,931 --> 00:00:51,764
with their ideas.
Someone who is receptive enough to 

14
00:00:53,571 --> 00:00:54,404
friends and acquaintances and even 
strangers to see when the other is 

15
00:00:57,261 --> 00:00:59,480
clearly not interested in what you're 
saying.

16
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:03,110
Telling a story that your audience can't
possibly relate to is not cool.

17
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:05,930
Boasting is not cool.
Isolation is not cool.

18
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,800
I don't go in for winners and losers,
but I do go in for.

19
00:01:09,801 --> 00:01:10,310
Cool.
Okay,

20
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:13,940
so there was this one time in eighth 
grade when I was acting out in class,

21
00:01:13,941 --> 00:01:17,060
being loud and clownish and stupid and 
my teacher,

22
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,013
Mr Leventhal told me to go wait outside,
you know that horrible exile of 

23
00:01:21,441 --> 00:01:25,040
secondary school when you get 
reprimanded and everybody sees it and it

24
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:27,110
was even worse because I like this 
teacher,

25
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:28,580
you know,
we were supposed to be friends.

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,833
Well,
he came out into the hallway with a 

27
00:01:30,831 --> 00:01:33,260
conciliatory look and said to me,
Evan,

28
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:35,660
look,
I know you're funny.

29
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:38,960
Everyone in that class knows you're 
funny,

30
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,513
but being funny doesn't mean a damn 
thing if you don't have timing to this 

31
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:46,351
day.
That is the best.

32
00:01:46,351 --> 00:01:48,660
Certainly the most influential advice 
I've ever gotten.

33
00:01:48,661 --> 00:01:50,130
There's no question that it changed my 
life.

34
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,350
Not right away,
but good advice never does.

35
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:56,460
Gradually it sunk down and took hold and
in moments when in the past I would have

36
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:00,240
blurted out some thoughtless vulgarity.
I instead opted to keep silent,

37
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,280
to listen,
to feel the waves,

38
00:02:02,281 --> 00:02:03,114
have a conversation and say something or
tell a joke only when the moment was 

39
00:02:05,971 --> 00:02:08,700
prime for it.
It's a lot like surfing and surfing.

40
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,890
You're going to wipe out a lot in the 
course of getting better.

41
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,980
No matter how good you get,
the day will never come when you've said

42
00:02:13,981 --> 00:02:16,410
your last idiotic thing.
Word of advice.

43
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,453
Don't trust anyone who never makes a 
fool of him or herself because that 

44
00:02:20,311 --> 00:02:22,920
person is nailing.
The more we grow,

45
00:02:22,921 --> 00:02:26,940
the more this mastery of timing augments
our ability to get along in the world.

46
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,910
It has its application in a perfectly 
executed joke,

47
00:02:29,911 --> 00:02:31,680
yes,
but timing isn't everything.

48
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,480
It's in the way we treat our family,
our friends,

49
00:02:33,481 --> 00:02:34,650
our teachers,
our bosses,

50
00:02:34,651 --> 00:02:35,484
our employees.
A good relationship depends on knowing 

51
00:02:37,861 --> 00:02:39,090
when you should,
for example,

52
00:02:39,091 --> 00:02:39,924
be deferential when you should stick up 
for your opinion on understanding when 

53
00:02:42,961 --> 00:02:46,200
it's okay to offer help to a friend and 
when it's okay to ask for it.

54
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,510
Timing plays a huge part in your 
writing.

55
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:52,860
A good story is not interesting,
but for the rhythm at which it's told,

56
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:56,220
the same goes for a good speech or a 
good lecture or a good vlog.

57
00:02:56,221 --> 00:02:58,170
I do think that it's a natural part of 
growing up,

58
00:02:58,171 --> 00:02:59,004
but it's one that becomes so obsessive 
in the early years that the desire to 

59
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:03,124
learn for learning's sake gets pushed to
the fringe because it holds no value in 

60
00:03:05,891 --> 00:03:06,724
social currency and it's an obsession 
that lingers into the first years of 

61
00:03:09,611 --> 00:03:12,820
college because we're also anxious to 
fit in and that's natural too,

62
00:03:12,821 --> 00:03:13,654
but I think eventually it dawns on us 
that what it meant to be cool in high 

63
00:03:16,721 --> 00:03:20,200
school is not really going to be enough 
to make a happy life.

64
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:21,063
After graduating college,
I became so extremely frustrated with 

65
00:03:23,441 --> 00:03:24,274
how little I really knew.
It seemed to me that all my knowledge 

66
00:03:26,741 --> 00:03:29,950
was like so many free floating clouds 
that had no connection.

67
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:33,100
What I learned was easily forgotten and 
often contradictory.

68
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,180
I had the timing stuff down,
but now I wanted to know things.

69
00:03:37,181 --> 00:03:38,014
I wanted to know everything,
so I resolved to start at the beginning 

70
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:42,663
with the foundation of all knowledge 
philosophy and I began to read like I 

71
00:03:46,631 --> 00:03:51,631
sometimes eat potato chips ferociously 
and the result of all that was this a 36

72
00:03:52,991 --> 00:03:57,190
page discourse on truth.
Summing up everything that I thought and

73
00:03:57,191 --> 00:03:58,024
believed I had it printed up at Kinko's 
and I sent a copy out to all my family 

74
00:04:01,751 --> 00:04:03,430
and friends as if to say,
here,

75
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:06,280
this is what I know and this is who I 
am.

76
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,700
If you're interested to read it and you 
can find a link to an online copy in the

77
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,080
dubliner.

78
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,913
I just reread it two years later and I 
don't agree with everything that's in 

79
00:04:13,781 --> 00:04:15,160
there,
but that's to be expected.

80
00:04:15,161 --> 00:04:17,020
There's still a lot of things in there 
that I do agree with.

81
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,213
For me,
it symbolizes more at the beginning of 

82
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,273
the period of my life when I became 
obsessed with learning and it's an 

83
00:04:23,651 --> 00:04:26,290
appetite that is perpetually 
unquenchable.

84
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:28,930
It never gets boring because there's 
always something more to learn.

85
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:33,790
The timing was ironically not so great.
All of this happened after I had already

86
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:36,280
graduated college.
After the countless thousands of dollars

87
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,233
we're already spent on an education that
I wish I could go back and get more out 

88
00:04:40,181 --> 00:04:41,014
of.
I would have taken so many more liberal 

89
00:04:43,061 --> 00:04:43,894
arts classes if I had to do it again,
but Aha to the point of this circuitous 

90
00:04:47,951 --> 00:04:51,940
video.
You can do it again on this phone.

91
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,133
I have an APP called Itunes u on it.
There are literally dozens of courses 

92
00:04:57,941 --> 00:04:59,920
from schools like Stanford,
Yale,

93
00:04:59,921 --> 00:05:00,754
and Harvard.
Do you know how much harvard costs and 

94
00:05:03,101 --> 00:05:03,934
tuition per year?
Do you know how much work you have to 

95
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:11,641
put into get into that school and they 
put their courses on my phone for free.

96
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:13,983
I mean,
am I the only one who thinks this is 

97
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,480
awesome right now.
I am taking a course,

98
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,260
a Stanford course called the 
international system in the 20th century

99
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:24,723
on my couch with a beer for no money at 
all and I don't have to do any of the 

100
00:05:33,971 --> 00:05:34,804
home.
