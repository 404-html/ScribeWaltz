1
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,790
It's quickly become apparent that jared 
cushner,

2
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:09,530
the 36 year old real estate investor and
husband,

3
00:00:09,531 --> 00:00:10,364
that Ivanka trump is president donald 
trump's most trusted advisor within his 

4
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:15,813
inner circle,
a circle whose top tier includes chief 

5
00:00:18,281 --> 00:00:19,600
strategist,
Steve Bannon,

6
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:20,643
and chief of staff reince priebus.
Now it's pretty easy to know where 

7
00:00:23,711 --> 00:00:24,544
priebus and bannon stand politically as 
chairman of the Republican National 

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,593
Committee for five years.
Priebus is the voice of the Republican 

9
00:00:30,461 --> 00:00:31,294
establishment,
and as the former editor of Breitbart 

10
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:34,413
bannon champions the populist economic 
nationalism that appeal to so many of 

11
00:00:36,941 --> 00:00:40,540
trump's working class voters,
it's important to know where trump's key

12
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:41,374
advisors stand on the issues because 
it's almost impossible to know where 

13
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:47,410
trump himself stands.
Trump's not an idealogue.

14
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,273
He's a pragmatist who's changed his 
views multiple times throughout the 

15
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:52,870
years.
When it comes down to it,

16
00:00:52,871 --> 00:00:55,720
his political goals are basically this.

17
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:57,070
We're going to win,
win,

18
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,260
win.
You're going to get so tired of winning.

19
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,460
You're going to say,
Mr.

20
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:01,750
President,
please.

21
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,540
We don't want to win anymore.
It's too much

22
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:05,453
evolved.
Trump's advisors tasks with this charge 

23
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,133
of winning for the American people.
Jared cushner is the most important but 

24
00:01:11,921 --> 00:01:12,754
also the least understood.
We simply don't know where he stands 

25
00:01:15,461 --> 00:01:17,680
politically and there are a few reasons 
for that.

26
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:22,000
Kushner is only 36 years old.
He's got no history in politics and it's

27
00:01:22,001 --> 00:01:26,320
clear that even two or three years ago,
being a top advisor to the most powerful

28
00:01:26,321 --> 00:01:29,230
man in the world wasn't remotely on his 
radar,

29
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:30,183
is the last big project,
was buying this cluster of Brooklyn 

30
00:01:32,651 --> 00:01:37,540
buildings from the Jehovah's Witnesses 
in 2013 for 375 million in order to turn

31
00:01:37,541 --> 00:01:39,640
it into hipstery story,
office space,

32
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:41,260
Kushner,
and Ivanka too,

33
00:01:41,261 --> 00:01:42,094
for that matter has always been a sort 
of hybrid of the left leaning hipster 

34
00:01:45,311 --> 00:01:48,790
generation and the older mega rich 
business elite.

35
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:52,480
Jared was certainly born into wealth and
lots of it,

36
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,280
but his family didn't start out that 
way.

37
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,400
Both his paternal grandparents were 
Holocaust survivors,

38
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:59,590
thankfully making it to the United 
States.

39
00:01:59,591 --> 00:02:02,440
In 1949 where Jerry's grandfather,
Joseph,

40
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,890
a construction worker,
started building and managing New Jersey

41
00:02:05,891 --> 00:02:07,240
apartments.
His son,

42
00:02:07,241 --> 00:02:10,300
jarrod's father Charles then started 
acquiring real estate,

43
00:02:10,301 --> 00:02:13,870
turning cushner companies his business 
into a billion dollar empire.

44
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:16,690
This is the world that jared cushner 
grew up in.

45
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,890
It was deeply religious.
Jarrod was brought up in modern Orthodox

46
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,020
Judaism,
massively wealthy and privileged.

47
00:02:23,021 --> 00:02:23,854
Jared was conveniently accepted to 
Hartford after his parents pledged two 

48
00:02:26,501 --> 00:02:27,334
point $5,000,000
to the university and actually quite 

49
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,413
democratic.
Charles cushner was one of the most 

50
00:02:33,221 --> 00:02:36,550
prominent donors to democratic 
politicians on the east coast.

51
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:37,623
In fact,
he was the largest single donor to the 

52
00:02:39,161 --> 00:02:42,400
2000 New York Senate campaign of Hillary
Clinton,

53
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:48,430
and then things came apart.
New Jersey based developer,

54
00:02:48,431 --> 00:02:53,431
Charles cushner is charged with hiring a
prostitute to blackmail to witnesses and

55
00:02:53,981 --> 00:02:56,410
a federal investigation where he is a 
target.

56
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:00,010
Charles conviction was deeply traumatic 
for charit as of course,

57
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:03,070
it would be a checkup his entire life 
and not just emotionally,

58
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,220
but professionally too.
At the age of 24,

59
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:09,540
Jerry took over the massive empire,
his father bill,

60
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:10,763
and he wasted little time making a 
splash of his own in 2007 cushner 

61
00:03:14,381 --> 00:03:16,280
companies bought an office building at 
six,

62
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:17,123
six,
six fifth avenue in Manhattan for one 

63
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:20,290
point $8,
billion dollars,

64
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,890
the most expensive single building 
purchase in US history.

65
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,340
Unfortunately,
it was really bad timing.

66
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,400
A year later,
the economy collapsed and six,

67
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:30,243
six,
six is not been able to generate enough 

68
00:03:31,601 --> 00:03:34,810
money for Kushner companies to pay off 
the debt even today.

69
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:37,480
But despite that setback,
cushner kept at it.

70
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:38,343
He kept making deals or trying to like 
the trendy tech office space in 

71
00:03:41,231 --> 00:03:42,064
Brooklyn.
It's clear that he's focused and driven 

72
00:03:44,351 --> 00:03:45,184
and ambitious,
but a success or failure in real estate 

73
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,060
tells us preciously little about where 
his mindset politically,

74
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:53,231
uh,
for all I know,

75
00:03:53,231 --> 00:03:56,740
he could still sympathize with the 
democratic values that his father funded

76
00:03:56,741 --> 00:03:57,574
so generously,
but truth is Christian or seems a bit 

77
00:03:59,621 --> 00:04:00,454
out of place in the conservative 
populist nationalist White House of 

78
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:03,993
Donald Trump.

79
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:07,720
Until you account for two things.
First,

80
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,820
his loyalty to family cushner always 
sticks by his own.

81
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:15,430
When his father was put away,
he didn't abandon him,

82
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,980
and when trump retweeted wittingly or 
not,

83
00:04:17,981 --> 00:04:20,830
some antisemitic imagery alongside a 
picture of Hillary Clinton,

84
00:04:20,831 --> 00:04:21,960
last summer,
cushing,

85
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:22,843
uh,
wrote an op Ed defending him in the New 

86
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,860
York Observer,
the newspaper that he owns.

87
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:30,670
That's the second place to look for 
hints of Kush nurse politics,

88
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:31,893
The Observer.
It was here that he developed a 

89
00:04:33,161 --> 00:04:36,100
friendship,
even a mentorship with Rupert Murdoch,

90
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:39,790
the media magnate and owner of Fox News,
Murdoch counsel,

91
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:40,624
jared gave him advice,
sent over books by prominent 

92
00:04:42,341 --> 00:04:43,174
conservative thinkers.
And soon the paper began to take on a 

93
00:04:45,521 --> 00:04:46,354
more right wing.
Then some say cushner even had a 

94
00:04:48,431 --> 00:04:49,264
vindictive streak using the paper to go 
after people who wronged him or his 

95
00:04:52,331 --> 00:04:53,350
family.
Like,

96
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,270
for example,
New York attorney general,

97
00:04:55,271 --> 00:04:58,480
Eric Schneiderman,
who investigated trump university.

98
00:04:58,810 --> 00:04:59,643
The headpiece of the observer published 
on Schneiderman is almost comical in 

99
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:02,884
it's defense of trump scam school.
A lot of people saw this same 

100
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:06,993
vindictiveness in the ouster of Chris 
Christie from trump's transition team 

101
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,800
last December.
Christie,

102
00:05:11,801 --> 00:05:12,634
of course,
was the man who sent jerrod's father to 

103
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:15,874
jail.
Mr Kushner engaged in a conspiracy with 

104
00:05:18,701 --> 00:05:22,750
co-conspirators.
It's a hire prostitutes.

105
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:23,703
This period is where cushner may have 
begun to acquire more conservative 

106
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:29,620
values,
but I have to be fair and say that these

107
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:32,650
are just inklings of what may be in his 
mind.

108
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,900
He barely ever puts things on the 
record.

109
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:39,640
He barely ever speaks to the media.
What we do know is that today cushner is

110
00:05:39,641 --> 00:05:43,390
overseeing a laundry list of things in 
trump's administration,

111
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:46,510
including heading the new office of 
American innovation,

112
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:49,600
being the key liaison for diplomats from
China,

113
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:51,700
Mexico,
and a dozen other countries,

114
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:52,773
and of course there's this.
If you can produce peace in the Middle 

115
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,873
East,
nobody can.

116
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,980
In most things,
trump and Kushner are opposites.

117
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:04,250
One is loud,
easily distracted and media obsessed.

118
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:08,630
The other is understated,
focused and media allergic,

119
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:09,733
but they both trust family and trump 
definitely trusts jared cushner for 

120
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:17,090
president with such little grasp on 
policy and detail.

121
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:18,283
That means jared cushner might just be 
the most influential person in the 

122
00:06:21,801 --> 00:06:22,634
world.
It would sure be nice to know a little 

123
00:06:24,741 --> 00:06:27,040
more about what people leaves.

124
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,970
Oh my God,
this couch is so comfortable.

125
