1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:00,983
Blackbaud,

2
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,050
so as we all know,
Steve Jobs died this Wednesday.

3
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,320
He was many things,
an entrepreneur,

4
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:20,910
a visionary,
a computer genius,

5
00:00:20,911 --> 00:00:23,160
and employer of thousands,
a nerd,

6
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:24,480
a father,
a husband,

7
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,100
a man of flesh,
sinew and bone.

8
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,510
Many of these things will reach into the
future and be his legacy,

9
00:00:30,511 --> 00:00:31,344
but I think the final mark that Steve 
Jobs will make on posterity will be 

10
00:00:35,551 --> 00:00:38,500
further reaching than we can get.
Let me explain.

11
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:39,383
So I have a number of friends who are 
product designers for tech and 

12
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:42,624
otherwise,
and they have all expressed to me a 

13
00:00:44,101 --> 00:00:46,170
similar frustration with the nature of 
their field.

14
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,730
Things automated to last anymore.
My products become obsolete in a year or

15
00:00:50,731 --> 00:00:54,870
let Celeste and both are certainly true.
Things aren't made to last.

16
00:00:54,871 --> 00:00:55,704
So during the week I work as a 
telemarketer and I talk to people every 

17
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,980
day who's 2000,
five,

18
00:01:01,981 --> 00:01:06,690
2006 model whatever is already having 
mechanical problems.

19
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,440
Now with certainly true that the auto 
industry could design and build vehicles

20
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,460
to last considerably longer than that.
They don't because if they did,

21
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,710
you wouldn't come back in six years to 
buy a new one.

22
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:17,573
This is called planned obsolescence.
The origin of the term is credited to 

23
00:01:20,251 --> 00:01:21,084
Bernard London in his 1932 essay 
entitled ending the Depression through 

24
00:01:23,611 --> 00:01:24,444
planned obsolescence in which he says 
furniture and clothing and commodities 

25
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,910
should have a span of life justice 
humans have,

26
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:31,763
of course,
he also proposed that there should be a 

27
00:01:32,401 --> 00:01:33,234
special government agency deciding the 
lifespans of products and anyone found 

28
00:01:35,431 --> 00:01:37,860
using a product past its depth.
They should be penalized,

29
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,980
but the more judicious ideas about 
planned obsolescence stuck.

30
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:43,620
Now what should be said?
That obsolescence itself is an intrinsic

31
00:01:43,621 --> 00:01:44,454
feature in any free market.
Accompany simply can't make the most 

32
00:01:47,461 --> 00:01:48,294
durable,
advanced product possible because it 

33
00:01:50,071 --> 00:01:52,230
would violate costs efficiency.
Basically,

34
00:01:52,231 --> 00:01:55,320
the best possible product would be so 
expensive to make that the term profit,

35
00:01:55,321 --> 00:01:58,020
it's price would be too high for anyone 
to want to buy a call.

36
00:01:58,021 --> 00:01:58,854
That intrinsic obsolescence.
Now there's a third kind and it occurs 

37
00:02:01,951 --> 00:02:02,784
when a new product or technology 
supersedes the old telephone over the 

38
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:06,624
telegraph dvds over vhs and laser disc 
mp3s over cds or cassettes over vinyl 

39
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:13,374
records.
This is called technical obsolescence 

40
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,900
and really the history of the universe,
the history of everything.

41
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,260
You can look at it as a process of 
technical obsolescence,

42
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:27,603
so in the early stages of the university
just had basic element of those basic 

43
00:02:30,851 --> 00:02:31,684
elements.
Carbon step forward as the most 

44
00:02:33,311 --> 00:02:37,420
versatile because it can form bonds in 
four directions over billions of years.

45
00:02:37,421 --> 00:02:39,370
Carbon based molecules became more 
intricate,

46
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,223
more complex.
Eventually these systems designed to 

47
00:02:41,801 --> 00:02:42,634
precise digital mechanism to store 
information on how to build a larger 

48
00:02:46,151 --> 00:02:48,370
society of molecules.
This is DNA.

49
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,233
It's sort of like a factory that holds 
precise records on how to build complex 

50
00:02:52,151 --> 00:02:52,984
systems of molecules,
so dna supersedes basic matter using 

51
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,240
basic matter.
Millions of years later,

52
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:03,040
DNA produces that can detect information
via their own sensory organs.

53
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,313
These brainy organisms can redesign the 
world in their own mind and put those 

54
00:03:10,501 --> 00:03:14,550
ideas into actions.
With this guy right here starts creating

55
00:03:14,551 --> 00:03:18,390
mechanisms of its own technology.
Technology advances slow at first,

56
00:03:18,391 --> 00:03:20,250
but then it gets more rapid and rabbit 
and rabbit and rabbit,

57
00:03:20,251 --> 00:03:21,600
rabbit.
What's next?

58
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:24,180
The integration of the biological width,
the technological

59
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,393
same make.
These were taken at the West Highland 

60
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:36,180
police station in 1984.
You were there.

61
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:42,260
Same model were taken today.
You have to let me see my son.

62
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,620
He's in great danger.

63
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,960
Well,
not exactly like that,

64
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:58,530
but slowly and gradually we will take on
biological components.

65
00:03:58,531 --> 00:04:00,780
My grandfather had a pacemaker in his 
chest.

66
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:01,643
My other grandfather had a hearing aid 
medal of honor recipient sergeant first 

67
00:04:03,931 --> 00:04:04,764
class.
Leroy petry has a bionic hand that 

68
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:10,550
responds to muscle movements in his arm 
and it's fucking awesome.

69
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:11,483
The relationship between the 
technological and the biological will 

70
00:04:13,741 --> 00:04:16,410
mature in the years to come.
It will become more intimate.

71
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:17,303
Eventually our intelligence will take 
advantage of the speed and power of our 

72
00:04:20,011 --> 00:04:20,844
technology and our technology will take 
advantage of the amazing pattern 

73
00:04:23,671 --> 00:04:24,504
recognition of our intelligence.
We as humans will become subject to the 

74
00:04:27,571 --> 00:04:31,170
rules of technical obsolescence and 
there are those who liked my friends get

75
00:04:31,171 --> 00:04:33,240
frustrated at the staying power of their
products,

76
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:35,310
but with technology and technical 
obsolescence,

77
00:04:35,311 --> 00:04:37,920
the whole theory of design has to be 
altered.

78
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:40,710
Maybe the goal can't be to design 
something which will last,

79
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:41,573
but rather to have a positive effect on 
the evolution of a product who defined 

80
00:04:45,001 --> 00:04:47,100
the terms by which we will continue to 
think about it.

81
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:51,000
Designers of both hardware and software 
will have a huge effect on the future of

82
00:04:51,001 --> 00:04:51,834
our race.
They will be out in front of us 

83
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:56,160
inventing and defining ways by which we 
think about ourselves.

84
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,023
Now,
if there were only someone in our day 

85
00:04:58,681 --> 00:05:01,290
who seamlessly combined hardware and 
software,

86
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,720
if there were only someone who 
understood that the relationship between

87
00:05:03,721 --> 00:05:04,554
these two things could be organic.
Imagine the future that we could expect 

88
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:13,310
if there were only a man who set the 
stage between the affair of intelligence

89
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,213
and its eventual form in a way that was 
complimentary and profound and always 

90
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,693
elegant.

91
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:27,170
And I think you still have to think 
differently to buy an apple computer.

92
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:28,923
Uh,
and I think the people that do buy them 

93
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:34,580
to think differently and they are the 
creative spirits in this world.

94
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,970
They are the people that are not just 
out to get a job done.

95
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:38,804
They're out to change the world and 
they're out to change the world using 

96
00:05:41,451 --> 00:05:46,100
whatever great tools they can get and we
make tools for those kinds of people,

97
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:47,923
so hopefully what you've seen here today
are some beginning steps that give you 

98
00:05:53,361 --> 00:05:54,194
some confidence that we too are going to
think differently and serve the people 

99
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,233
that have been buying our products since
the beginning because a lot of times 

100
00:06:03,081 --> 00:06:03,914
people think they're crazy,
but in that craziness we see genius and 

101
00:06:07,761 --> 00:06:09,280
those are the people we're making tools 
for us.

102
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:15,100
Thank you very much.
Thanks.
