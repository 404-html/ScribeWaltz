1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:02,353
Hm,

2
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:13,363
okay.
We're somewhere in the catskill 

3
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,360
mountains.
I don't know exactly where we're at.

4
00:00:16,361 --> 00:00:19,840
Hudson stone.
This is round tot.

5
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:22,580
We're going out to film the Russian 
movie right now.

6
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,140
I'm playing a Russian mob boss.
No,

7
00:00:24,141 --> 00:00:25,310
that's a joke.
Look at that.

8
00:00:25,311 --> 00:00:25,971
Look at that.
Look at that.

9
00:00:25,971 --> 00:00:26,541
Look at that.
Look.

10
00:00:26,541 --> 00:00:28,850
That strange thing is not having 
Internet,

11
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:33,350
not having Internet because it's 
extremely isolating.

12
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,460
You've been away from it for a little 
while.

13
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:40,993
What are those walls?
They're original property markers that 

14
00:00:44,361 --> 00:00:48,200
Dutch settlers built in the 16 hundreds.
They don't.

15
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:53,600
They aren't used now like our property 
lines are on paper.

16
00:00:58,580 --> 00:00:59,413
The faithful crossing archive has been 
doing this for thousands of years and 

17
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:10,030
you can do this.
This is all green underneath the stair,

18
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,473
but it's just froze.
That's the destination that we're going 

19
00:01:21,041 --> 00:01:26,041
to go going down there.
Oh my God,

20
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:29,124
man.

21
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:33,903
You went in there.
No fear for this gentleman is 

22
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,530
inspiration to all of them.
Really not going to go back up because

23
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:59,150
nice.
After being in the city for a long time,

24
00:02:01,571 --> 00:02:04,630
you get used to buildings and activity 
and all that stuff here,

25
00:02:04,631 --> 00:02:05,464
so it's sort of shocking.
It's a stunning feeling to be in 

26
00:02:08,531 --> 00:02:09,364
silence.
I think we all need to change 

27
00:02:10,661 --> 00:02:11,494
environments every once in a while,
just so that we can get out of our own 

28
00:02:12,941 --> 00:02:14,170
heads.
You know,

29
00:02:14,171 --> 00:02:15,610
this is.
This is a wonderful place.

30
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:19,913
Fuck.

31
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:26,563
Oh.

32
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:32,940
His practice was my grandfather and 
grandmother.

33
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:34,623
That's so nice.

34
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,300
Mild winter for when it's not too cold.
