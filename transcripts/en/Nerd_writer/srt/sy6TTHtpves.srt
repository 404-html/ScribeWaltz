1
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:03,560
Right.
I want to talk about liberal policies.

2
00:00:03,561 --> 00:00:05,840
We have six years of them under 
President Obama.

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:08,900
Let's put aside obamacare because it's 
still undefined.

4
00:00:08,901 --> 00:00:12,320
Whether that's going to really help the 
majority of people and put us out of the

5
00:00:12,321 --> 00:00:14,540
economy because some people are 
benefiting now,

6
00:00:14,541 --> 00:00:15,374
but the wages are still down.
What is the biggest accomplishment of 

7
00:00:20,631 --> 00:00:22,820
President Obama domestically,
in your opinion?

8
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:23,773
I think financial reform.
Do you think he's leading president 

9
00:00:25,491 --> 00:00:28,490
Obama's a world leader?
You think Putin is fearful of him?

10
00:00:28,491 --> 00:00:31,450
Do you think that that our problems over
the years.

11
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,280
One of the seven questions you just 
asked me this hope so.

12
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:35,173
It's an overall arch that President 
Obama's leadership has caused a lot of 

13
00:00:38,571 --> 00:00:39,404
problems.
Part of the problem is that we have the 

14
00:00:40,341 --> 00:00:43,720
European nation who backed down because 
they think America again.

15
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:46,520
One thing though.
You were right.

16
00:00:46,521 --> 00:00:48,590
Would you just say that again?
Yes.

17
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:49,850
I would say you were right.
Okay.

18
00:00:49,851 --> 00:00:51,050
There you go.
Barney frank,

19
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,580
everybody.
We got to get out of here right now.
