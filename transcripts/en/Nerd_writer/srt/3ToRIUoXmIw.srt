1
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:08,473
It's hard to believe that 40 years ago,
fleetwood Mac released it's masterpiece 

2
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:13,183
rumors because the record's still sounds
as beautiful and pristine and new as it 

3
00:00:18,201 --> 00:00:19,034
did in 1977.
It's a timeless album as far as I'm 

4
00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:24,020
concerned,
a work of art that lasts,

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:25,550
and that's really the goal,
isn't it,

6
00:00:25,551 --> 00:00:26,384
for anyone in the creative arts to make 
something that feels alive months and 

7
00:00:30,081 --> 00:00:32,000
years and decades after it's.

8
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:37,910
There you go.
So what makes

9
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:39,800
rumors so good?
Well,

10
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:40,693
there are of course a lot of reasons.
The skills of the individual band 

11
00:00:42,561 --> 00:00:44,240
members,
songwriting craft,

12
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:48,830
the producers and engineers and the 
virtually unlimited budget and time that

13
00:00:48,831 --> 00:00:49,664
fleetwood Mac got from warner brothers 
following the release of their self 

14
00:00:52,701 --> 00:00:55,070
titled Album,
which was burning up the radio.

15
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:56,173
That money in time means a lot to a band
like fleetwood Mac who like the Beatles 

16
00:00:59,781 --> 00:01:00,614
or Kanye west or frank ocean shines 
brightest in the studio where they can 

17
00:01:04,461 --> 00:01:07,760
exercise minute control over every part 
of a song.

18
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:12,140
Each track is like a sonic paintings.
As Co producer of rumors can.

19
00:01:12,141 --> 00:01:14,870
Calais wants described it,
and if you're wondering what he means by

20
00:01:14,871 --> 00:01:15,704
that,
just take a listen to the difference 

21
00:01:16,581 --> 00:01:20,090
between the demo of Stevie Nicks.
Classic Song Dreams,

22
00:01:20,091 --> 00:01:23,330
which you're hearing right now in the 
final product.

23
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,720
This is how it worked with fleetwood 
Mac.

24
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:46,613
In this case,
Stevie Nicks wrote a beautiful piano 

25
00:01:48,571 --> 00:01:51,420
melody and lyrics,
and the band in particular,

26
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:52,283
Lindsey Buckingham,
spent the better part of a year adding 

27
00:01:54,751 --> 00:01:58,890
and experimenting to create a rich,
full bodied sonic experience.

28
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,113
At its core,
dreams is a pretty simple song that 

29
00:02:01,711 --> 00:02:06,711
consists of only two quarts played over 
and over and over again.

30
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,063
Next,
presented the song to the band on a 

31
00:02:08,881 --> 00:02:09,714
fender Rhodes piano.
Buckingham added an acoustic guitar and 

32
00:02:12,751 --> 00:02:15,420
Christine mcvie played a Hammond b three
organ.

33
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:19,260
Then Mick fleetwood added drums and John
mcphee added Bass Guitar,

34
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:23,220
a very hypnotic rhythm section.
The base just alternates between F and g

35
00:02:23,221 --> 00:02:24,054
with some variations,
and the standup part of the drums are 

36
00:02:26,491 --> 00:02:31,110
these tapping high hats which run over 
everything throughout the whole song.

37
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:36,600
That's the track fleetwood Mac laid down
at the recording session in Sausalito,

38
00:02:36,601 --> 00:02:39,660
but the song was far from complete.
For example,

39
00:02:39,661 --> 00:02:40,494
Buckingham and the producers were 
convinced that the drums were hypnotic 

40
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:46,230
enough,
so they created a loop of eight bar loop

41
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:48,180
of eight bars,
eight bars,

42
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,660
easier said than done on analog tape 
delay.

43
00:02:51,661 --> 00:02:54,930
Also edit a phaser to the high hat so 
that they would have a swishy thing,

44
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,273
stick out later,
Buckingham recorded and electric guitar 

45
00:02:58,351 --> 00:02:59,184
part,
adding those soupy licks that float 

46
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:01,624
through the verse and then tighten up in
the pre chorus and eventually give way 

47
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,120
to an acoustic guitar in the course 
itself.

48
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,593
Buildup and release and change across 
the sections of a pop song or what make 

49
00:03:24,441 --> 00:03:26,450
it compelling to the Listener 
Buckingham,

50
00:03:26,451 --> 00:03:29,960
who is a genius at filling in these 
kinds of colors and ideas,

51
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:30,823
usually spur on more ideas.
Calais describes in his book on rumors 

52
00:03:33,771 --> 00:03:35,600
that when Nick's heard the new parts of 
the song,

53
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,960
she had her own idea for background 
vocals and the pre chorus.

54
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,090
She worked out the parts with Christine 
mcvie.

55
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:45,530
They give the sad and dreamlike song and
even more ghostly feel here.

56
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,393
Take a listen.

57
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:02,623
The song,
of course is about Lindsey Buckingham 

58
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,800
and it literally feels like it's 
haunting him.

59
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,053
Stevie Nicks wrote it shortly after 
their breakup and as she says in the 

60
00:04:10,281 --> 00:04:11,114
lyrics,
she couldn't go on because Lindsey 

61
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:15,650
wanted his freedom.
Now in loneliness,

62
00:04:15,651 --> 00:04:19,460
he has to dwell on what he had and what 
he lost.

63
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:23,510
It's a cruel twist of fate that the song
became such a hit that Buckingham had to

64
00:04:23,511 --> 00:04:26,840
spend the next 40 years singing it in 
concert.

65
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,220
Anyway,
at this point,

66
00:04:28,221 --> 00:04:29,990
the song was almost done.
Nicks,

67
00:04:29,991 --> 00:04:34,660
Buckingham and big V created a tight 
three part vocal harmony for the quarter

68
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:43,570
and then they brightened up the pre 
courses with a vibraphone and the second

69
00:04:43,571 --> 00:04:44,404
chorus with a Conga drum.
Those are both touches that you can 

70
00:04:46,601 --> 00:04:49,450
barely hear and certainly don't think 
about much when you listen,

71
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:54,250
but your brain registers the accents.
When Calais mixed the song,

72
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:58,000
he was careful to put every instrument 
in its right place and have a wide range

73
00:04:58,001 --> 00:05:01,960
of sounds from base to midrange treble.
In the case of dreams,

74
00:05:01,961 --> 00:05:02,794
Calais pushed many of the instruments 
down to give them a little more base so 

75
00:05:06,161 --> 00:05:06,994
that the high hat I talked about earlier
with stand out as well as Nick's 

76
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,104
incredible.
Also in the high end is Buckingham's 

77
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:20,444
whining guitar,
a muddled longing response to the sharp 

78
00:05:23,211 --> 00:05:28,211
poetry of the lyrics on rumors.
Fleetwood Mac made perfect pop music.

79
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:32,870
It didn't reinvent the wheel.
It dip the wheel and liquid gold.

80
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:35,090
These are concise,
gorgeous songs,

81
00:05:35,091 --> 00:05:40,010
stressed up with multicolored sounds,
but built on foundations of real emotion

82
00:05:40,011 --> 00:05:40,844
and real heartbreak.
I think it's pretty safe to say that 40 

83
00:05:42,831 --> 00:05:43,664
years from now will still be listening 
to fleetwood Mac as John Keats once 

84
00:05:46,701 --> 00:05:48,980
wrote.
A thing of beauty is a joy.

85
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,020
Yeah.
