00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:04,540
When I was growing up,
Nintendo was

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,290
the thing,
the original nes console,

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,030
Super Mario Legend of Zelda metroid,
Mike Tyson's punch out battle toads.

4
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:17,030
Then we got into Sega and all things 
sonic.

5
00:00:17,031 --> 00:00:20,630
Then Super Nintendo came out and I 
played a lot of donkey Kong country,

6
00:00:20,631 --> 00:00:25,631
Aladdin and turtles and time Nintendo.
Sixty four was a revelation Mario,

7
00:00:26,001 --> 00:00:29,090
64 Mario Kart,
the lesser known but still great.

8
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,070
Diddy Kong racing and of course the 
masterpiece of masterpieces,

9
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:37,250
awkward arena of time for many kids.
My generation and after video games were

10
00:00:37,251 --> 00:00:39,140
just a part of growing up.
After school,

11
00:00:39,141 --> 00:00:39,974
I'd go to one of my friend's houses and 
we'd play 64 or second saturn for a few 

12
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:44,361
hours,
go outside,

13
00:00:44,361 --> 00:00:45,830
run around,
play some more,

14
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:46,843
go home.
We played video games because it was 

15
00:00:48,141 --> 00:00:51,820
something to do like playing horse in 
the driveway or Walpole.

16
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:56,570
It was just another form of competition.
The pure competition of games,

17
00:00:56,571 --> 00:01:00,140
which is just a way of filling free time
with purpose.

18
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:01,003
The last console I ever owned was 
playstation two and I fell off gaming 

19
00:01:04,791 --> 00:01:05,624
when gaming got much more complicated 
than the side scrolling that I grew up 

20
00:01:09,261 --> 00:01:09,430
with.

21
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:12,460
If at that time you would've asked me,
can video games be art?

22
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,200
I would have said I'm 13.
What do I know?

23
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:19,220
My opinion on it now is that those games
were games.

24
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,113
The objectives were clear,
the rules relatively simple like soccer 

25
00:01:23,061 --> 00:01:23,894
or basketball or any other sport.
The primary purpose of the experience 

26
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:27,853
was to win in the period.
Since Games have become vastly more 

27
00:01:31,761 --> 00:01:32,594
complicated and the question of whether 
or not that form is an art of fine art 

28
00:01:36,411 --> 00:01:40,190
has become the topic of serious 
philosophical debate legally.

29
00:01:40,191 --> 00:01:41,024
Of course,
that decision was decided on much more 

30
00:01:42,531 --> 00:01:43,364
specific terms.
It started in the early eighties when a 

31
00:01:45,591 --> 00:01:46,424
series of American court decisions found
that video games could not be covered 

32
00:01:49,791 --> 00:01:50,624
under arts free speech protections 
because they were no more expressive 

33
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,033
than pinball or chest.
Those precedents determine much of what 

34
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:58,784
followed in 2002 federal judge Steven 
Limbo ruled against the protection of 

35
00:02:02,511 --> 00:02:02,760
games.

36
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,950
Saying that like,
Bingo,

37
00:02:03,951 --> 00:02:07,100
the court fails to see how video games 
express ideas,

38
00:02:07,101 --> 00:02:08,300
impressions,
feelings,

39
00:02:08,301 --> 00:02:11,240
or information unrelated to the game 
itself.

40
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,103
Not until 2011 the matter get the 
definitive decision that it deserved 

41
00:02:15,381 --> 00:02:20,381
when the Supreme Court finally extended 
arts protections to video games in Brown

42
00:02:20,991 --> 00:02:25,010
vs the entertainment Merchants 
Association in a seven to two rule,

43
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:28,970
and of course the legal definition of 
video game stands quite apart from their

44
00:02:28,971 --> 00:02:32,870
philosophical definition,
but in the time span of all those little

45
00:02:32,871 --> 00:02:36,470
decisions,
the scope of video games has expanded to

46
00:02:36,471 --> 00:02:39,410
include things like missed grand theft 
auto,

47
00:02:39,411 --> 00:02:40,244
the Sims,
rpgs with narratives more compelling 

48
00:02:43,011 --> 00:02:46,700
than most science fiction in Hollywood 
or contemporary literature.

49
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:47,563
Games today have real and fully realized
economies like the one which was shaken 

50
00:02:51,651 --> 00:02:52,484
to its core in eve online when this mega
space battle from earlier this year 

51
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:00,970
destroyed endgame spaceships to the of 
300,000

52
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:03,430
real dollars and visually.

53
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,263
I don't know if you can get more 
digitally sophisticated than the 

54
00:03:06,401 --> 00:03:10,240
cinematics for games like Batman Arkham 
asylum or elder scrolls.

55
00:03:10,241 --> 00:03:11,074
I don't know if you can find an 
experience more elegant than the 

56
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:17,170
Gameplay for Super Mario Galaxy or feds.
Do.

57
00:03:17,171 --> 00:03:20,440
All of these things complex as they are 
at up to art.

58
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:21,663
Well,
at the core of this is the question of 

59
00:03:22,571 --> 00:03:23,404
whether something that must be 
categorized as a game can also be 

60
00:03:26,711 --> 00:03:31,630
categorized as a work of art to be sure 
all kinds of artistic expression involve

61
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:34,450
some interaction with the source 
material,

62
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:35,343
but is the physical interaction in 
gaming of some kind of qualitatively 

63
00:03:39,311 --> 00:03:40,144
disqualifying kind?
I've always been a stickler for 

64
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:42,993
distinctions for philosophical labels,
but it's questions like this that make 

65
00:03:46,091 --> 00:03:46,924
me think about why people are very 
precious about art and they try to 

66
00:03:50,591 --> 00:03:51,424
include all the things they love under 
its masthead like advertising or 

67
00:03:54,911 --> 00:03:55,744
cooking,
but to me the desperate attempt to have 

68
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:02,790
games included in the art speaks less to
the significance of the category of art.

69
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,293
Then the curious lack of significance.
We attach in comparison to the category 

70
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,333
of games.
The extraordinary injection of subtlety 

71
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,633
and beauty into the universe of video 
games seems to me a herald of what 

72
00:04:16,511 --> 00:04:20,380
gaming can and will be to us in the 
future.

73
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:21,603
In the 2012 game called journey,
you play as a rope to figure in the 

74
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:26,500
desert,
moving slowly,

75
00:04:26,501 --> 00:04:29,950
gracefully wordlessly toward a shining 
mountains in the distance.

76
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,473
The goal is singular,
but gradually informed by traces on the 

77
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:38,260
faded civilization.
Then you discover along the way the game

78
00:04:38,261 --> 00:04:39,094
play the music,
the symbolism of the culture that was 

79
00:04:40,841 --> 00:04:45,760
lost puts you in an emotional space,
unique to all other forms of media.

80
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:48,063
Reaching the mountain is like an 
apotheosis and like the apotheosis of 

81
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:52,323
art.
It is the kind that life itself is it 

82
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,373
capable of sustaining.
Contained in this game is a meditation 

83
00:04:59,981 --> 00:05:00,814
both on the unspoiled image of what we 
want and it's profound unsatisfactories 

84
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,200
reflection,
what we thought.

85
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:13,370
Fuck yeah.
For Video Games,

86
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:31,863
thanks for watching and allowing a sort 
of non game or to take part in this 

87
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:35,823
really fascinating discussion.
I still do play Mario Cart on a regular 

88
00:05:39,581 --> 00:05:40,810
basis,
so that should give me something.

89
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,150
If you liked this video,

That's just been the best way to get 
these videos out there and follow me on 

91

twitter and Tumbler and asked me
