1
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:06,503
The first 28 minutes of saving private 
Ryan are devoted to the bloody allied 

2
00:00:10,531 --> 00:00:14,940
invasion of Omaha beach on June six,
1944.

3
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,900
The scene is rightly regarded as one of 
the best battle scenes in film history.

4
00:00:18,901 --> 00:00:19,734
Thanks to a brutal and unflinching 
recreation by Steven Spielberg by 

5
00:00:23,611 --> 00:00:26,370
placing this extended scene right at the
start of the film,

6
00:00:26,371 --> 00:00:27,204
it's clear that Spielberg's goal was to 
drop the viewer right into the action 

7
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,033
without warning a traumatic experience 
that leaves the viewer on edge for the 

8
00:00:35,221 --> 00:00:39,390
rest of the movie and this way,
Spielberg mimics the exhaustion that the

9
00:00:39,391 --> 00:00:44,040
allied soldiers had to fight through for
the entirety of their time at war,

10
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:48,720
but to create and realize the scenes,
Spielberg had to reconcile a fundamental

11
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:49,583
contradiction.
The sequence had to be chaotic and 

12
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,200
coherent at the same time.
In other words,

13
00:00:55,201 --> 00:00:58,950
the critical impression of the battle 
should be one of randomness,

14
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,660
of violence and death occurring so 
rapidly and indiscriminately at the mind

15
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,740
is bewildered.

16
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:05,573
It has no time to process,
but that randomness has to be 

17
00:01:08,551 --> 00:01:12,150
communicated cinematically via some sort
of structure,

18
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:16,530
a coherence that somehow leaves you with
the feeling of chaos.

19
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,393
What Spielberg is trying to do is fill 
in two different kinds of gaps in our 

20
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:22,950
knowledge about this historical moment.
First,

21
00:01:22,951 --> 00:01:23,784
he wants to close the gap between 
Hollywood's heroic depictions of World 

22
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:27,953
War II and the vicious,
deeply harrowing experiences of those 

23
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:31,943
who were actually there.
I mean even in strong depictions of the 

24
00:01:34,141 --> 00:01:36,750
Normandy landings like the great 1962 
movie,

25
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:39,870
the longest day filmed entirely on 
tripods.

26
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:40,883
The viewer's experience is still some 
distance from the subjectivity of the 

27
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:45,624
moment in saving private Ryan.
Spielberg wants to shrink that distance 

28
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:48,790
as much

29
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:49,623
possible.

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,833
The other gaps Spielberg wants to close 
is the one between what we know about 

31
00:01:55,961 --> 00:01:58,540
this event and what we've actually seen 
of it.

32
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,940
There is extremely little footage of the
Normandy invasion on June six,

33
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,793
1944,
and almost none from the landing at 

34
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:08,290
Omaha Beach,
and there are a lot of reasons for this.

35
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:09,124
A significant percentage of the 
cameramen who filmed the war for the 

36
00:02:11,111 --> 00:02:11,944
allied powers were killed.
The remaining did their best to avoid 

37
00:02:14,951 --> 00:02:15,784
that same fate by finding places of 
cover where they could film at a 

38
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:20,050
distance.
For this reason,

39
00:02:20,051 --> 00:02:23,890
you get a lot of footage from before the
landing at Normandy on the boats,

40
00:02:23,891 --> 00:02:24,724
which Spielberg recreates in saving 
private Ryan and a lot of footage after 

41
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:29,980
the battle is over.
During the chaos,

42
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:30,873
cameramen were doing their best to keep 
themselves and their cameras out of 

43
00:02:34,181 --> 00:02:36,730
danger.
Documentaries that Spielberg relied more

44
00:02:36,731 --> 00:02:38,920
on were shot far from the Normandy 
beaches,

45
00:02:38,921 --> 00:02:41,200
specifically with the Marines at 
Toronto,

46
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:44,140
which was shot in Japan,
and the battle for San Pietro,

47
00:02:44,141 --> 00:02:46,900
which was made by the famous filmmaker,
John Houston.

48
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:47,933
It'll be watching that second film.
Spielberg was struck by how cameramen 

49
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,143
always stayed low to the ground and how 
the camera shook when an explosion went 

50
00:02:55,271 --> 00:02:59,770
off nearby as critic toby higgins notes,
Spielberg discovered that he adopted the

51
00:02:59,771 --> 00:03:01,930
style of the battlefield.
Cameraman,

52
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:06,430
he could achieve a more subjective 
experience of the war and that's exactly

53
00:03:06,431 --> 00:03:07,264
what he did,
but the footage that I think has the 

54
00:03:09,101 --> 00:03:13,870
most impact on the Omaha beach scene is 
John Ford's masterful war film.

55
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,913
The Battle of midway from 1942 in that 
film forward brilliantly keeps in 

56
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:24,541
moments when blasts affect the camera 
gate or knock his hand held cameras back

57
00:03:24,551 --> 00:03:26,590
and forth from this.
In some creative editing,

58
00:03:26,591 --> 00:03:29,080
you get a much more visceral impression 
of the battle,

59
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:33,910
so the essence of the idea for saving 
private Ryan is here and it's obvious in

60
00:03:33,911 --> 00:03:34,744
the battlefield camera approach,
but what's not so obvious is how 

61
00:03:37,571 --> 00:03:41,440
Spielberg takes this essence and injects
it with steroids.

62
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,513
For example,
one of the things that Spielberg does 

63
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:48,280
that no actual war time camera man could
do is switch perspectives.

64
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:51,250
The Omaha beach scene functions from 
three different perspectives,

65
00:03:51,251 --> 00:03:54,220
the vantage of the invisible battlefield
cameraman,

66
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:58,870
the vantage of Tom Hanks and the vantage
of the German soldiers on the top of the

67
00:03:58,871 --> 00:03:59,704
cliffs,
Spielberg alternates between these to 

68
00:04:01,451 --> 00:04:02,284
give a more 360 degree perspective on 
the battle without losing any of the 

69
00:04:05,921 --> 00:04:08,500
immediacy.
That is his primary concern.

70
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,453
Even crazier.
It actually took me a few watches to 

71
00:04:10,841 --> 00:04:15,841
realize that this shot right here is 
actually meant to be a moment inside Tom

72
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,750
Hanks head like the most intense first 
person shooter game ever.

73
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:20,973
This kind of thing couched,
almost hidden in the middle of the rest 

74
00:04:23,351 --> 00:04:27,790
of the footage intensifies that feeling 
of being there to its most extreme.

75
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,833
Maybe this is why the sequence triggered
actual ptsd and if you world war two 

76
00:04:32,471 --> 00:04:33,304
veterans who watched the film,
but the key to understanding how 

77
00:04:36,191 --> 00:04:37,024
Spielberg squares chaos with coherence 
is in the amount of information that he 

78
00:04:42,101 --> 00:04:43,720
crammed into each shot.

79
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,990
The Omaha beach scene might seem like 
the craziest,

80
00:04:46,991 --> 00:04:49,510
fastest,
most intense sequence in the film,

81
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:54,610
but I counted the shots and the scene 
that lasts exactly 24 minutes.

82
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:55,653
There are exactly 200 shots,
which means that every shot averages 

83
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:01,503
seven point two seconds.
I mean that is an incredibly high 

84
00:05:05,261 --> 00:05:09,070
average for a scene like this and it 
didn't seem right to me until I actually

85
00:05:09,071 --> 00:05:11,770
went back and watched the scene with 
this in mind.

86
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:16,150
You're asked to comprehend so much in 
this Omaha beach scene,

87
00:05:16,151 --> 00:05:19,930
so Spielberg eases the pressure on your 
brain by panning,

88
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,793
tilting,
or moving the camera when others would 

89
00:05:23,141 --> 00:05:24,190
just cut.
This way.

90
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:27,490
You don't have to waste too much mental 
energy on orienting yourself.

91
00:05:27,491 --> 00:05:30,160
You can absorb the relevant information 
as it comes,

92
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,053
and Spielberg is great at feeding you 
relevant information as my friend Tony 

93
00:05:34,271 --> 00:05:35,104
wants remark.
This is a guy who loves to move the 

94
00:05:36,671 --> 00:05:40,840
camera with motivation,
so in a 12 second shot like this one,

95
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,793
you get a wide shot to close ups,
three inserts and the medium shot eight 

96
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:47,043
pieces of information,
and the transitions here are really 

97
00:05:49,511 --> 00:05:50,344
great too.
He loves to start a long shot with the 

98
00:05:52,001 --> 00:05:52,834
action from the previous moment.
This is how he strings together all 

99
00:05:55,601 --> 00:05:56,434
these mini vignettes and it gives them a
forward momentum that keeps the viewer 

100
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,433
on track.

101
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,073
Of course,
there's so much more to say about the 

102
00:06:07,191 --> 00:06:08,024
scene,
about the sound mixing and the lenses 

103
00:06:09,441 --> 00:06:10,274
and the de Saturation of the film stock,
about the costume design and the set 

104
00:06:13,251 --> 00:06:16,280
design,
but that's all been well covered before.

105
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:17,503
What inspires me about this scene is how
such a Maelstrom of action retains its 

106
00:06:22,971 --> 00:06:27,860
focus from end to end.
You can't just stage some insanity film,

107
00:06:27,861 --> 00:06:28,694
a bunch of it from different angles and 
hope to find a through line in the 

108
00:06:30,741 --> 00:06:33,380
editing a scene with an impact like 
this,

109
00:06:33,381 --> 00:06:36,740
something that you can revisit again and
again and find new things.

110
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:41,180
It takes real cinematic concentration.
In other words,

111
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:46,630
anyone can capture chaos,
but only the best can capture chaos with

112
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:49,573
clarity.

113
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,980
There is a new nerd writer video every 
Wednesday,

114
00:06:57,981 --> 00:07:01,580
so if you go right there to that box 
that I've set up and click that,

115
00:07:01,581 --> 00:07:03,310
you'll subscribe and get all the videos.
And,

116
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:05,570
and that is what helps me out the most.
It really is.

117
00:07:05,571 --> 00:07:06,830
Um,
a couple of other things.

118
00:07:06,831 --> 00:07:08,360
I'm way too back lit right now,
by the way,

119
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:11,360
I just launched the nerd writer.net,
which is my website.

120
00:07:11,361 --> 00:07:12,194
You can find the videos there and asked 
me questions and frequently asked 

121
00:07:14,721 --> 00:07:15,554
questions.
Is there.

122
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,660
So check that out.
Also Humpback on Instagram,

123
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,420
I don't really know why at the nerd 
writer follow me there.

124
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:23,240
Some cool stuff.
I'll try not to post garbage pictures.

125
00:07:23,241 --> 00:07:24,074
I might post some pictures of garbage,
but only if it's like artistic and 

126
00:07:25,851 --> 00:07:26,600
worthwhile.
Anyway,

127
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,010
I'll see you guys next Wednesday.
