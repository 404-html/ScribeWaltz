1
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:05,950
Intellectually,
I understand that all of us are going to

2
00:00:05,951 --> 00:00:06,784
die,
that humanity will perish and fall back 

3
00:00:09,341 --> 00:00:10,174
into perfect obscurity,
maybe not tomorrow or for a million 

4
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:14,373
years,
but eventually all we ever made will be 

5
00:00:17,081 --> 00:00:17,914
dust,
and yet I keep making things other than 

6
00:00:20,291 --> 00:00:21,124
for the reason that existential dread 
grips may only about once a week and 

7
00:00:24,281 --> 00:00:28,120
that I have a concern for bettering my 
world along more modest timescales.

8
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:32,830
I make things because those things have 
intrinsic value.

9
00:00:32,831 --> 00:00:34,570
To me,
that's not a simple concept,

10
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:35,463
intrinsic value,
and yet it's something we all have 

11
00:00:37,201 --> 00:00:41,470
assigned to the things we love to do.
It's why we love to do them because that

12
00:00:41,471 --> 00:00:46,090
activity is valuable for its own sake.
Writing Fiction,

13
00:00:46,091 --> 00:00:49,060
that's something I do for its own sake.
Making music.

14
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:52,060
This channel,
the nerdwriter is intrinsically valuable

15
00:00:52,061 --> 00:00:52,894
to me.
It combines my love of learning and 

16
00:00:54,461 --> 00:00:59,461
expression with the skills I've gained 
in video editing over years and years.

17
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,333
When I'm editing these blogs,
a process that takes about four to six 

18
00:01:02,801 --> 00:01:03,634
hours,
I often find myself in a sort of super 

19
00:01:05,921 --> 00:01:06,754
focused state where it almost seems like
my awareness is merging with my actions 

20
00:01:10,991 --> 00:01:11,824
on the computer and the next thing I 
know I'm feeling lightheaded because 

21
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:18,810
hours have passed and I've completely 
forgot to eat dinner and now it's 1:00

22
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:19,643
AM.
There's a psychological term for this 

23
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:24,520
feeling and it's called flow.
It's a concept introduced by a Hungarian

24
00:01:24,521 --> 00:01:27,850
psychology professor.
Mihai cheeks sent me high when he became

25
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:31,570
fascinated by how artists got lost in 
their work.

26
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,170
When she accidentally I talked to 
painters or athletes or scientists.

27
00:01:35,171 --> 00:01:39,130
They all described to him similar 
feelings of heightened focus.

28
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,083
One composer described it like this.
You are in an ecstatic state to such a 

29
00:01:43,121 --> 00:01:45,910
point that you feel as though you almost
don't exist.

30
00:01:45,911 --> 00:01:46,744
My hand seems devoid of myself and I 
have nothing to do with what is 

31
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:50,650
happening.

32
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:51,483
I just sit there in a state of awe and 
wonderment and the music just flows out 

33
00:01:56,771 --> 00:01:57,604
of.
It was this continual reference to the 

34
00:01:58,751 --> 00:01:59,584
image of being in a river or water 
flowing that gave Mei the name for his 

35
00:02:04,451 --> 00:02:08,040
phenomenon and it seems about as old as 
humanity is.

36
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:11,830
The historical sources suggests that 
Michelangelo may have been in a state of

37
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:12,664
flow while painting the Sistine Chapel.
It's reported that he would paint for 

38
00:02:15,911 --> 00:02:20,911
days at a time forsaking food or sleep 
in the Tao of Jeet Kune Doe.

39
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:25,240
Bruce Lee instructs empty your mind,
be formless,

40
00:02:25,241 --> 00:02:26,980
shapeless,
like water.

41
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,873
Everyone can experience this feeling,
but to do so requires a few 

42
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,920
preconditions.
First,

43
00:02:32,921 --> 00:02:37,330
you have to be involved in an activity 
with a clear set of goals and progress.

44
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:42,430
The task at hand must have clear and 
immediate feedback and most importantly,

45
00:02:42,431 --> 00:02:43,264
there has to be a good balance between 
the perceived challenges of a task and 

46
00:02:47,381 --> 00:02:49,100
one's perceived skill.

47
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:49,963
She sent me high,
developed a model for his idea and it 

48
00:02:52,481 --> 00:02:55,180
looks like this.
On the y axis is the challenge level,

49
00:02:55,181 --> 00:02:58,150
and on the x axis is the skill level.
As you can see,

50
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,540
when the challenge really hard and the 
skills are really low,

51
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,710
that's going to cause anxiety because 
you know what you want to do,

52
00:03:05,711 --> 00:03:06,544
but you can't even get close to 
achieving any kind of representative 

53
00:03:09,701 --> 00:03:13,990
drawing fits that category for me only 
when the challenge level is high and you

54
00:03:13,991 --> 00:03:17,650
have the skills to match kind of state 
of flow be achieved.

55
00:03:17,651 --> 00:03:21,160
The composer I quoted above had been 
working at is crap for decades.

56
00:03:21,161 --> 00:03:25,330
The process was second nature to him.
A pro athlete who gets in the zone,

57
00:03:25,331 --> 00:03:29,350
another synonym for flow practices for 
the balance of his life.

58
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,303
I've been video editing for 10 years and
because of all those years of hard 

59
00:03:33,911 --> 00:03:36,700
earned technique,
I can see what I want to do,

60
00:03:36,701 --> 00:03:40,840
like a mechanic can see how the pieces 
of a car should come together and like a

61
00:03:40,841 --> 00:03:43,150
mechanic or a composer or an athlete.

62
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,223
I'm forced to push myself into new 
territory because the challenges 

63
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:50,920
eventually get easier and I fall back 
into a state of control.

64
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:51,783
When writing fiction,
I waver somewhere between arousal and 

65
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:57,310
anxiety.
It will be many more years.

66
00:03:57,311 --> 00:03:58,144
I suspect before my talent matches the 
Gargantuan task of writing and I can 

67
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:03,123
slip into that space where the muteness 
nest of my thoughts resolves into the 

68
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:07,624
lovely shapes I admire in other writers.
The key point here is that flow is 

69
00:04:11,201 --> 00:04:14,200
possible in so many areas of experience.
Art,

70
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:15,880
science,
sports at work,

71
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:19,360
in business or law or medicine,
but it's vital.

72
00:04:19,361 --> 00:04:24,100
Prerequisite in all those cases is an 
extended devotion to crap.

73
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:24,963
We all have the ability to distinguish 
between different qualities of pleasure 

74
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:32,200
being in a flow state seems to me to be 
made of pure stuff,

75
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,020
not just for what it achieves,
but for what it is.

76
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:36,003
I don't know why human beings can 
experience intrinsic value in the 

77
00:04:39,461 --> 00:04:44,461
activities that they choose to love,
but I'm happy to go along for the ride.

78
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,310
So since I've been back from my last 
little break,

79
00:04:48,311 --> 00:04:51,010
we've talked about beach whales,
Comic Book Films,

80
00:04:51,011 --> 00:04:52,660
Keen Sugi,
the hero effect,

81
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,720
how nuclear weapons screwed art forgers 
video games,

82
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:56,583
architecture of the right to be 
forgotten and now flow and the 

83
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:01,443
conversations and discussions in the 
weeks following all those videos have 

84
00:05:04,841 --> 00:05:07,660
been more interesting to me in most 
cases.

85
00:05:07,661 --> 00:05:08,494
Then the videos themselves.
I want to thank everybody who's been 

86
00:05:10,841 --> 00:05:11,674
watching since I've been back and 
engaging in these videos and these 

87
00:05:15,671 --> 00:05:17,680
topics.
I'm glad you're part of this community.

88
00:05:17,681 --> 00:05:18,514
If you're watching this,
thank you for watching and engaging and 

89
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,873
continue to do so.
I'm going to focus as much as I can on 

90
00:05:23,951 --> 00:05:24,784
you asked me anything on tumbler where 
we can really sort of expand on these 

91
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:31,030
topics or comment below.
Post this on reddit.

92
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:33,130
Follow me on twitter for short little 
thoughts,

93
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:36,760
all that good stuff.
I will see you next Friday.
