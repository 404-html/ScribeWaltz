1
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:25,080
Rembrandt's

2
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,520
painting,
the Nightwatch,

3
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:27,563
perhaps the most famous work of his long
career and have the Dutch golden age 

4
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,960
generally is not set at night and it's 
not really a watch either.

5
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:37,763
It's a painting of the militia company 
of district two under the command of 

6
00:00:40,861 --> 00:00:42,990
captain fronds Bennett,
coke,

7
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,710
which is also it's true law,
original name.

8
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,790
Essentially later after years of varnish
and low light dark in the canvas,

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,840
someone called it the night watch and it
stuck because,

10
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:56,820
well,
that's what it looked like.

11
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:59,340
In fact,
the nightwatch was meant to be a daytime

12
00:00:59,341 --> 00:01:02,640
scene just like other portraits of the 
Dutch civic guards,

13
00:01:02,641 --> 00:01:03,474
groups of well to do Amsterdam.
Citizens tasked with keeping the peace 

14
00:01:06,631 --> 00:01:10,710
should threats come to the city walls 
over the 16th and 17th centuries,

15
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:11,603
civic guard portraits became a genre all
its own and is painting in the 

16
00:01:15,361 --> 00:01:18,150
Netherlands,
moved away from spiritual subject matter

17
00:01:18,151 --> 00:01:20,160
and toward the secular artists.

18
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,910
Welcomed commission work from these 
wealthy guilds because they wanted large

19
00:01:23,911 --> 00:01:26,550
group portraits again and again and 
again.

20
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,073
But if you want to know why.
Rembrandt's is the only civic garde 

21
00:01:30,661 --> 00:01:33,390
painting that makes it into most school 
curriculums.

22
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:34,883
Oh,
you have to do is look at it 

23
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:38,210
commissioned to do what all the others 
had done.

24
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:40,440
Show off the paying members of the 
guild.

25
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,540
Rembrandt takes the genre and explodes 
his vision through it.

26
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:47,340
The Night Watch is an eruption of 
action,

27
00:01:47,341 --> 00:01:52,341
shadow and light with drama that's more 
suited to a biblical or historical epic.

28
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,680
Not 17 guys from peace time,
Amsterdam.

29
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:59,970
No offense to captain coke.
So what makes the nightwatch so great?

30
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:00,983
Well,
what hits me right away is the balance 

31
00:02:02,611 --> 00:02:05,460
that rembrandt strikes between chaos and
unity.

32
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:08,460
He clearly wanted to create a canvas 
with a lot of movement,

33
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:10,770
but the challenge was how to make that 
movement.

34
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:11,603
People lurching in different directions,
performing a variety of actions cohere 

35
00:02:15,211 --> 00:02:17,640
into a unified whole.
The keystone,

36
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:18,563
the part of the painting that holds 
everything in place or the dual figures 

37
00:02:21,721 --> 00:02:25,860
of the captain and his lieutenant,
the rest of the portrait moves away from

38
00:02:25,861 --> 00:02:27,330
them diagonally.
Indeed,

39
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:32,100
rembrandt places these lines directly 
onto the painting in the form of weapons

40
00:02:32,101 --> 00:02:32,934
and Poles,
and the effect isn't just two 

41
00:02:34,711 --> 00:02:35,544
dimensional and maybe the most striking 
thing is the captain and the lieutenant 

42
00:02:38,431 --> 00:02:41,370
seemed to be emerging from the picture 
plane,

43
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,950
the captain's hand ordering the company 
forward.

44
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:47,100
It's as if you could grab it and pull 
them out of the frame.

45
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:50,310
The lieutenants part is in the spirit 
like weapon he's holding in.

46
00:02:50,311 --> 00:02:54,870
His left hand is so expertly foreshorten
feels like it could cut you.

47
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,063
In fact,
based on the angle and the placement of 

48
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:58,344
the weapon shadow on the ground,
the partisan is beyond the picture 

49
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:03,730
plane,
or at least it should be.

50
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:07,990
Another trick rembrandt uses to achieve 
this effect is one that will be familiar

51
00:03:07,991 --> 00:03:08,824
to filmmakers.
The figures in the front are painted 

52
00:03:10,781 --> 00:03:11,614
with detail and clarity.
While the further back you go in the 

53
00:03:14,141 --> 00:03:14,974
composition,
the softer and hazier thing seemed to 

54
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:18,064
get.
Rembrandt is mimicking depth of field 

55
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:21,003
and optical phenomenon that can make 
objects in focus pop from their 

56
00:03:24,611 --> 00:03:25,444
backgrounds.
All of these effects were carefully 

57
00:03:27,101 --> 00:03:31,180
planned by Rembrandt to anchor the 
composition around the central figures.

58
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:35,830
The longer you look at the night watch,
the more meaning emerges from this burst

59
00:03:35,831 --> 00:03:37,780
of frenetic energy.
For example,

60
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,673
the three men with guns are performing 
the three main actions associated with 

61
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:43,493
the archibus,
the primary weapon of this particular 

62
00:03:45,701 --> 00:03:46,534
guilt loading,
firing and blowing clear the gunpowder 

63
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,010
pen.
In fact,

64
00:03:51,011 --> 00:03:51,844
these poses match almost perfectly 
engravings from a book called exercise 

65
00:03:55,361 --> 00:03:56,194
of arms,
a famous manual on how to use weaponry 

66
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:00,340
released at the beginning of that 
century.

67
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:04,210
This particular civic guard,
the Clo veneers is signaled again in the

68
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:06,410
chicken that's hanging from the young 
girls waste.

69
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:09,310
A similar claw was on the Clo veneers 
code of arms,

70
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:12,430
and while the captain's hand points 
toward the viewer,

71
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,670
it shadow points toward his companies 
function.

72
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:20,230
It's cradling the emblem of Amsterdam 
Elian and three crosses.

73
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:23,380
The clo veneers were supposed to protect
the city.

74
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:27,140
The other notable feature is Rembrandt's
famous use of Couto,

75
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:30,640
sqirl and effective,
deeply contrasted light and shadow.

76
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:34,690
It's a technique that first came to 
prominence in the work of Caravaggio who

77
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:35,524
used sharp contrasts and harsh lighting 
to create intense drama in his 

78
00:04:38,951 --> 00:04:39,784
paintings.
The rembrandt was clearly interested in 

79
00:04:41,261 --> 00:04:42,730
this technique,
but for him,

80
00:04:42,731 --> 00:04:43,564
light served a somewhat different 
purpose and not only as remembrance 

81
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:47,483
cattle softer than Caravaggio's,
but the light in his painting seems to 

82
00:04:51,131 --> 00:04:55,120
have a numinous quality as if once it 
touches the subjects,

83
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:56,590
it becomes a part of them.

84
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:57,663
If we turn back to the nightwatch,
we can see that rembrandt uses 

85
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,830
[inaudible] to single out two key 
figures,

86
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,770
the lieutenant and the girl,
as we've already seen,

87
00:05:05,771 --> 00:05:09,550
both these figures contained symbols 
that call back to the group itself.

88
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:10,563
In the case of the lieutenant,
it's as if the captain's orders to 

89
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:16,690
assemble are illuminating his second in 
command and from his light.

90
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,970
The rest of the company is to fall in 
line,

91
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:20,643
and yet compositionally the two light 
had figures almost serve the opposite 

92
00:05:24,221 --> 00:05:26,290
purpose.
Instead of unifying the company,

93
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:27,124
the girl and the lieutenant seem 
strategically placed to break up the 

94
00:05:30,251 --> 00:05:33,160
individual men in the canvas flanking 
the captain.

95
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,023
They almost isolate him and thanks to 
their contrast were drawn to the 

96
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:37,993
haphazard actions and faces of each man 
all seeming to be lost in their own 

97
00:05:43,391 --> 00:05:44,224
world.
The night watches capturing the moments 

98
00:05:46,091 --> 00:05:49,120
before the company sets out to its 
collective purpose,

99
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,750
but the painting almost makes us doubt 
that they'll ever get there.

100
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:53,703
Indeed,
by the time this painting was made in 

101
00:05:54,641 --> 00:05:55,474
16,
Forty two nearing the victorious of the 

102
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,273
80 years war with the Spanish,
the Dutch were prosperous in civic 

103
00:06:02,181 --> 00:06:05,330
guards were more ceremonial than 
necessary.

104
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,583
At a certain point,
these companies became clubs for men to 

105
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:12,410
play with their weapons and chip in for 
fancy group portraits.

106
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,693
It's not inconceivable that Rembrandt 
may have been secretly making fun of 

107
00:06:16,881 --> 00:06:19,850
them a little bit in this his most 
famous painting,

108
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,850
but that's the tension that the painter 
captures in the night.

109
00:06:22,851 --> 00:06:23,684
Watch and endless jockeying between 
light and dark nation and individual 

110
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:28,783
chaos and order.
Rembrandt could never let either one of 

111
00:06:31,851 --> 00:06:36,020
those elemental forces went out in his 
composition because if he did,

112
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,063
he lose the most essential thing,
the thing he was striving for and 

113
00:06:40,341 --> 00:06:41,174
achieves within effect that makes this 
one of the greatest paintings of all 

114
00:06:45,261 --> 00:06:46,094
time.

115
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,150
