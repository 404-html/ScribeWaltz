1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:02,063
In movies or TV,
whenever one character says to another 

2
00:00:05,311 --> 00:00:06,144
character,
can't we just go back to the way things 

3
00:00:09,901 --> 00:00:10,734
used to be?
It's usually a sign on the part of the 

4
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:13,554
writers that that character has yet to 
face up either to reality or to 

5
00:00:17,281 --> 00:00:20,010
themselves.
The cliche is offered up as a solution.

6
00:00:20,011 --> 00:00:20,844
Some trauma has passed parties that were
enraged or hurt or a mistaken one to 

7
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:26,693
forgive or heal or apologize.
They want the bad times to give way to 

8
00:00:31,681 --> 00:00:34,410
good times,
but only on the pretense,

9
00:00:34,411 --> 00:00:37,650
the false pretense that the bad times 
never happened.

10
00:00:37,651 --> 00:00:40,170
This is a kind of red herring of 
reconciliation.

11
00:00:40,171 --> 00:00:44,430
We know that trauma can be repressed,
but it can't be erased.

12
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:48,330
Lasting reconciliation is achieved by 
emotional self awareness,

13
00:00:48,331 --> 00:00:49,164
by embracing the change agents of trauma
and how they irreversibly reorganize 

14
00:00:53,641 --> 00:00:57,330
elements of personality,
identity and social reality.

15
00:00:57,331 --> 00:01:00,420
This idea,
the idea of embracing our wounds,

16
00:01:00,421 --> 00:01:01,254
our brokenness is manifested quite 
politically in the Japanese mending 

17
00:01:05,341 --> 00:01:09,630
practice of consumer,
literally meaning golden joinery.

18
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:10,463
Consume.
D is the art of fixing broken pottery 

19
00:01:12,451 --> 00:01:13,550
with lacquer,
resin,

20
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,573
dusted or mixed with powder goal.
Asian cultures have a long history in 

21
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:20,124
lacquer ware,
though it matured into a sophisticated 

22
00:01:21,841 --> 00:01:26,841
art in the Chinese Shang Dynasty.
The earliest discovered lacquered object

23
00:01:27,151 --> 00:01:31,860
dates to the Neolithic Himoutu culture 
in the fifth millennium,

24
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:36,690
BC older than the earth itself.
According to young Earth creationists,

25
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,520
pretty impressive.
It could be alien,

26
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:41,280
the various delicate arts of lacquer 
ware,

27
00:01:41,281 --> 00:01:45,090
ramified and expanded down millenniums 
and cultures.

28
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:45,983
The story of consumer reportedly begins 
in the 15th century with the Japanese 

29
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,293
military commander.
The story goes that famous Shogun 

30
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:54,601
Ashikaga,
Yoshi.

31
00:01:54,601 --> 00:01:58,740
Masa broke one of his prize Chinese tea 
bowls,

32
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:02,190
so he sent the item back to China for 
repair.

33
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:07,460
What he got in return was his bowl 
mended with bulky and ugly metal staples

34
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:08,941
dismayed,
Yoshi,

35
00:02:08,941 --> 00:02:09,774
Masa prompted Japanese craftsmen to 
search for a more aesthetic means of 

36
00:02:14,071 --> 00:02:14,550
repair.

37
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:15,383
The Art of keen,
Suki became famous for turning broken 

38
00:02:17,881 --> 00:02:21,960
objects into pieces more beautiful than 
the original product.

39
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:26,820
There are even rumors of people breaking
their own possessions on purpose so that

40
00:02:26,821 --> 00:02:29,580
they can be mended using this lovely 
technique.

41
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:35,190
The philosophy here follows from abroad 
or Japanese aesthetic called Wabi,

42
00:02:35,191 --> 00:02:36,024
Sabi that finds beauty not in 
traditional western ideals of symmetry 

43
00:02:39,271 --> 00:02:40,104
or geometry,
but in Buddhist concept of impermanence 

44
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,290
and imperfection.
The fracture is on a ceramic bowl.

45
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,900
Don't represent the end of that object's
life,

46
00:02:48,901 --> 00:02:51,990
but rather an essential moment in its 
history.

47
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,440
The flaws of a shape aren't hidden from 
inspection,

48
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:56,543
but in blaze with golden significance.
Maybe Hemingway had consumed pee on his 

49
00:03:01,721 --> 00:03:05,890
mind when he wrote that famous line from
a farewell to arms.

50
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:10,950
The world breaks everyone and afterward 
many are strong in the broken places.

51
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:12,903
The amazing art of consuming a fading 
art like so many handcrafts symbolizes 

52
00:03:17,111 --> 00:03:21,490
the truth.
That repair requires transformation.

53
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:25,930
That pristine is less beautiful than the
broke,

54
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:27,243
and that the shape of us is impossible 
to see until it's fractured until the 

55
00:03:31,631 --> 00:03:34,540
wound,
like a crack runs.

56
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:35,374
It's like,

57
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,160
hey everybody,
thanks for watching.

58
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,023
[inaudible] is just another example of 
the profound differences in western and 

59
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,873
eastern aesthetics and thought.
There's not too much to read about it 

60
00:03:54,941 --> 00:03:57,100
online,
but every article that I found,

61
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,023
I'll put in the description below under 
work cited and you can check it out 

62
00:04:00,671 --> 00:04:01,504
there.
Thank you to everybody who followed me 

63
00:04:03,221 --> 00:04:07,120
on twitter following last week's video.
That was awesome.

64
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:07,993

videos have been amazing and I'll try to

66
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,353
continue to respond to all of them.
But if you do want to have a more 

67
00:04:16,121 --> 00:04:16,954
involved discussion,
go to Mike Tumbler page and use the ask 

68
00:04:19,601 --> 00:04:23,680
me anything feature and I'll be able to 
respond in a sort of deeper,

69
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:24,514
more thoughtful way.
And is always throw this video up on 

70

Reddit if you found it interesting.
Um,

71
00:04:28,721 --> 00:04:32,230
reddit has been awesome and I will see 
you next time.
