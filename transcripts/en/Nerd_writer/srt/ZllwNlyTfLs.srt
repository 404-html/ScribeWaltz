1
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:06,800
It's hard to believe,
but Thursday marks three years since the

2
00:00:06,801 --> 00:00:11,801
final episode of breaking bad air on TV 
while it was on breaking bad grip,

3
00:00:12,111 --> 00:00:12,944
the culture of more tightly than almost 
any other show and its legacy is still 

4
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:19,880
intact today,
I think because the arc of episodes that

5
00:00:19,881 --> 00:00:20,714
concluded the story brought a satisfying
and brutal reckoning on what came 

6
00:00:25,341 --> 00:00:26,174
before.
I think the best episode of the series 

7
00:00:28,341 --> 00:00:29,174
can be found in that arch and today I 
want to talk about that episode as 

8
00:00:31,641 --> 00:00:36,641
humanity is the poem it references and 
how the ideas in both help us understand

9
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:39,500
the show as a whole.
In a lot of ways.

10
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:43,520
This episode though,
third from the last book ends the entire

11
00:00:43,521 --> 00:00:48,521
series right or more wily Beckett makes 
this explicit by staging the pre opening

12
00:00:48,651 --> 00:00:49,484
credits scene as a flashback to the 
first episode when Walter White and 

13
00:00:52,551 --> 00:00:56,390
Jesse Pinkman are making their very 
first batch of crystal Meth,

14
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:57,680
the reaction has begun.

15
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:58,873
The narrative of the show is its own 
kind of chemical reaction brought about 

16
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,673
by choices like walters choice to make 
crystal meth to raise money for his 

17
00:01:06,681 --> 00:01:08,690
cancer treatment.
Like the first lie,

18
00:01:08,691 --> 00:01:11,210
he's rehearsing to tell his wife about 
this,

19
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:12,373
that lead to the horrifying consequences
we're about to witness director Ryan 

20
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,120
Johnson makes these things explicit in 
another way.

21
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:21,650
We're more wildly.
Beckett,

22
00:01:21,651 --> 00:01:25,670
has plot and dialogue.
Johnson has visuals,

23
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:26,563
visuals like the slow fading of past 
elements that show the passage of time 

24
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:35,090
and the disappearance of the people and 
the things that once were.

25
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,133
What we see in this episode is 
effectively the bloody end of 

26
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:42,350
Heisenberg's rain.
But what's interesting is how not bloody

27
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:47,240
it is while he beckett in Johnson placed
the focus instead on reactions,

28
00:01:47,241 --> 00:01:51,140
reaction shots,
and so we get an episode of Gazans.

29
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:54,860
Quizzical gates is angry,
gazes blankies is penetrating gazes.

30
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:58,130
What's important isn't that wall gets 
away with holly,

31
00:01:58,131 --> 00:02:00,500
for example,
but that skylar sees it.

32
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,543
The death of Hank is showed for all of 
two seconds before Ryan Johnson quickly 

33
00:02:04,671 --> 00:02:07,460
cuts away.
Compare this to the 44 seconds.

34
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:11,930
He lingers on Walt Skyler's,
Flynn's emory's reaction to that news.

35
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:16,850
So in this episode we see Walter White 
through the eyes of everyone else,

36
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,300
including virtually all of the key 
players in the show.

37
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:24,110
And as is often the case,
these people see more about walt,

38
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:27,800
then he can about himself,
the smartest guy I ever met.

39
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:37,480
He made up his mind 10 minutes ago.
All these reactions,

40
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:41,200
these gates makes waltz,
own tragedy even more stark.

41
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,640
It's his inability to see himself 
through the eyes of those around him.

42
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:46,503
Other people's gazes are like a mirror 
that we use to see ourselves as Johnson 

43
00:02:50,801 --> 00:02:55,360
highlights twice in this episode.
Waltz not ready to look into mirrors yet

44
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,310
when he arrives home later in the 
episode,

45
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,353
he uses all his regular to me,
negotiated everything is going to be 

46
00:03:02,351 --> 00:03:05,290
fine.
Both of you to trust me.

47
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:06,223
You have to go right now.
But his words fall flat on skylar and 

48
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:12,693
they sound absurd to us.
While he beckett uses these words 

49
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,133
brilliantly.
I think as an extension of Walt's 

50
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:19,743
blindness,
I mean this is the climactic scene of 

51
00:03:21,581 --> 00:03:22,414
the episode and the climactic moment in 
the scene is not the fight between 

52
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,033
Walton skylar,
but our reaction bracketed by two 

53
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:33,860
versions of the same line,
but first time walt screams it.

54
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:38,020
But when he finally glimpses himself 
through the eyes of his family,

55
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:39,243
those same words deflate entirely.
This is where we can find some insight 

56
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,333
in the episode title Ozymandias,
which references a sonnet by Percy 

57
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,220
shelley from 18,
18.

58
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:52,803
In fact,
it's the poem that Bryan Cranston reads 

59
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,233
in a promotional video for the season 
showing that Vince Gilligan and the 

60
00:03:57,401 --> 00:03:59,770
writers wanted to highlight this 
connection.

61
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:04,480
The poem tells the story of Shelly's 
meeting with a traveler who describes in

62
00:04:04,481 --> 00:04:09,481
detail a ruined sculpture of Ozymandias,
the Greek name for Ramses,

63
00:04:09,521 --> 00:04:10,354
the second,
the most powerful Pharaoh of the 

64
00:04:11,681 --> 00:04:12,514
Egyptian empire,
and the empty landscape where his great 

65
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,023
empire used to stand.
Some of the parallels here are obvious 

66
00:04:19,121 --> 00:04:19,954
like this shot where Walter white falls 
rigidly to the ground like a statue 

67
00:04:23,381 --> 00:04:26,680
crumbling like walters frown and 
wrinkled lip,

68
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,190
like the lone level sands stretch far 
away,

69
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,083
Ryan Johnson even stages some visual 
flourishes like having the broken glass 

70
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:35,860
of the car window look a lot like 
Walton,

71
00:04:35,861 --> 00:04:39,520
Jesse's blue meth,
visualizing their empire fading into the

72
00:04:39,521 --> 00:04:40,354
desert like the poem breaking bad is a 
comment on the transients of power and 

73
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:45,484
the arrogance of those who acquire it,
but the poem is also about seeing 

74
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,490
through the eyes of others.

75
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:52,653
After all,
we only see Ozymandias through the eyes 

76
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:59,050
of the sculptor and the sculptors work 
through the eyes of the traveler and the

77
00:04:59,051 --> 00:05:02,140
traveler is common through the words of 
the poet.

78
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:03,423
I think this is so applicable to 
breaking bad and to this episode 

79
00:05:05,981 --> 00:05:09,280
particularly because what makes drama 
work,

80
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:13,390
what makes it interesting isn't 
climactic action scenes or the bombastic

81
00:05:13,391 --> 00:05:17,080
declaration of colorful characters or 
even big ideas.

82
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,440
It's the succession of reactions that 
cascade off of every choice,

83
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:23,703
that chemical and emotional reactions of
people living together on earth these 

84
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:31,710
days.
There is an incredible pressure for show

85
00:05:31,711 --> 00:05:32,544
runners have a show like this to have an
end in mind to stick the landing with 

86
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:40,210
big payoffs and developments that will 
shock all of us.

87
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,213
Well Ozymandias has those things,
but I give the writers and director 

88
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,023
major credit for sticking to what 
matters in an incredibly important 

89
00:05:49,871 --> 00:05:50,704
episode for letting us see Walter White,
king of kings undoing through the many 

90
00:05:54,731 --> 00:05:56,890
eyes of those who loved him.

91
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:05,270
There is a brand new nerd writer video

asked to interfere in the content which 

96
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:20,660
