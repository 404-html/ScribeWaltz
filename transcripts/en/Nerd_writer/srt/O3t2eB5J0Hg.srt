00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:05,730
In the chaos of the last few months,
I've put a lot of things on hold,

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:07,890
not just the blog.
Also my writing it.

3
00:00:07,891 --> 00:00:09,870
Since those two things sort of go hand 
in hand,

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,000
I want to start both up at the same 
time.

5
00:00:12,001 --> 00:00:15,450
So I started working on a third book,
which I'm really excited about.

6
00:00:15,451 --> 00:00:16,284
Art Saifai.
I've also started a new tumbler called 

7
00:00:18,091 --> 00:00:18,924
52 bucks,
52 weeks in which it's exactly what it 

8
00:00:21,451 --> 00:00:22,284
sounds like.
The idea is that the people I work with 

9
00:00:23,071 --> 00:00:23,904
are way more knowledgeable than me,
so this is how you know I will destroy 

10
00:00:26,581 --> 00:00:28,670
them.
I feel I've gotten into Lincoln,

11
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,513
the dubliner.
I've also started working on a new 

12
00:00:30,361 --> 00:00:30,960
album.
What?

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,640
You make music.
Yes,

14
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,260
but you already knew that

15
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,140
interesting,

16
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:43,343
simple and unprofessional music,
but know it makes me really happy and 

17
00:00:45,841 --> 00:00:48,930
creative and I'll put it on soundcloud 
when it's done.

18
00:00:48,931 --> 00:00:51,690
Now you might be saying nerdwriter,
you have a job now,

19
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,390
aren't you putting too many things on 
your plate too?

20
00:00:54,391 --> 00:00:56,060
Which you know,
I can only say yes.

21
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:56,903
I don't know.
I figure what's the use of having an 

22
00:00:57,661 --> 00:00:59,840
appropriately full plate on the back?
Mom,

23
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:02,260
I just press the red bugging me.
Recording.

24
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,010
Yeah.
Okay.

25
00:01:06,011 --> 00:01:07,000
One more time.
Ready?

26
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:08,721
Shelly,
are you the one?

27
00:01:08,721 --> 00:01:11,080
I know it's videoing now.
You're videoing.

28
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:12,700
Ready?
Cool.

29
00:01:12,701 --> 00:01:13,900
Lily.
Lily,

30
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,660
are you ready?
