1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,360
So in the very first sentence or the New
York Times review of reservoir dogs,

2
00:00:09,361 --> 00:00:12,660
critic Benson camping wrote,
it's been an unusually good year for the

3
00:00:12,661 --> 00:00:13,494
discovery of first rate new American 
film directors then goes on to list for 

4
00:00:17,221 --> 00:00:20,280
films that you've never seen by four 
directors that you've never heard of,

5
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,000
none of whom lasted more than a decade,
making movies before continuing.

6
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,850
Now add to that list the name of Quentin
Tarantino,

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,790
I guess one out of five ain't bad.

8
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,133
Twenty five years after that,
Review Tarantino was probably the most 

9
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:42,220
popular living working director in the 
world after maybe Spielberg and Scorsese

10
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,083
is eight.
Films have grossed over one point 

11
00:00:44,381 --> 00:00:45,214
$5,000,000,000
worldwide and writing about his work 

12
00:00:47,861 --> 00:00:48,694
could fill a small library.
The quarter century milestone is a good 

13
00:00:55,481 --> 00:00:59,170
opportunity to look back at how 
Terentino's first film has aged.

14
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,273
I have a slight obsession with first 
with how things begin in the first shot 

15
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:07,150
of reservoir dogs is probably the first 
that I think about the most.

16
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:07,661
Okay.
Yeah.

17
00:01:07,661 --> 00:01:09,580
Obviously,
I know this is not technically the first

18
00:01:09,581 --> 00:01:12,550
shot of the movie,
but I've always sort of viewed the diner

19
00:01:12,551 --> 00:01:13,384
scene that proceeds the opening credits.
That's a kind of overtures Terentino's 

20
00:01:16,121 --> 00:01:16,954
entire filmography.
Traditionally overtures are moot 

21
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,700
centers,
a little bit of music that sets the tone

22
00:01:21,701 --> 00:01:22,534
for what's about to follow.
It's only natural that in Terentino's 

23
00:01:24,821 --> 00:01:25,654
land,
the overture is a seven minute 

24
00:01:26,561 --> 00:01:29,650
conversation about Madonna songs and the
merits of tipping,

25
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,020
but society says,
don't have these guys over here,

26
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,880
but tip these guys over here.
That's bullshit.

27
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:37,330
So the first shot of the story proper is
this,

28
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,360
and it's one of the most electrifying 
openings in film history,

29
00:01:40,361 --> 00:01:43,240
like the first notes in the first led 
Zepplin album.

30
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,850
Before you have a chance to blink,
you're involved,

31
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:48,520
your mind fans forward and backward 
through time.

32
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:51,010
It's usual in film for actions to have 
consequences,

33
00:01:51,011 --> 00:01:53,290
but here,
consequences have actions,

34
00:01:53,291 --> 00:01:55,920
actions to begin to imagine the heist 
gone long

35
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,013
just like you're in the past.
You're also in the future calculating 

36
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:08,270
how long this guy has left to live and 
what can be done to save him,

37
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:10,880
and of course like Mr Orange bleeding 
out.

38
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:15,680
You can't escape the present either 
because that's what pain is a brutal and

39
00:02:15,681 --> 00:02:17,750
specific attention to the present 
moment.

40
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:19,123
It's that pain,
that panicked feeling of time running 

41
00:02:20,931 --> 00:02:24,870
out that separates this film from others
that begin in media read.

42
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,353
Whenever I create anything,
I always hold it up against the opening 

43
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:32,750
of reservoir dogs is the beginning as 
attention capturing as this.

44
00:02:32,751 --> 00:02:36,200
Does it have the same kinetic energy 
launching you into the narrative?

45
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,190
It's here too.
Of course,

46
00:02:37,191 --> 00:02:40,220
that were introduced to the technique 
that made Terentino's famous.

47
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,113
The nonlinear structure of his 
storytelling and interviews Terentino's 

48
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:47,990
compared the Byzantine tracks of his 
early films to novel writing.

49
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:50,690
Novelists have always had just a 
complete freedom.

50
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,240
Pretty much tell their story anyway.
They saw fit.

51
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,553
Alright,
and that's Kinda what I'm kind of what 

52
00:02:56,451 --> 00:02:57,284
I'm trying to do,
but while I think the comparison to 

53
00:02:58,581 --> 00:02:59,414
fiction apt,
I also think that there is a 

54
00:03:00,521 --> 00:03:01,354
relationship here again with USAC.
One of the things that I think help 

55
00:03:04,391 --> 00:03:05,224
reservoir dogs age so well is 
Terentino's instinctive sense for 

56
00:03:08,411 --> 00:03:09,730
narrative momentum.
To me,

57
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:10,564
the ordering of the movie is a lot like 
an under examined aspects of popular 

58
00:03:13,571 --> 00:03:15,940
music.
The sequencing of albums.

59
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,430
One of the reasons I love Abbey road for
example,

60
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:19,264
one of the reasons I've listened to it 
so many times all the way through is 

61
00:03:21,341 --> 00:03:22,174
because the song sequence carries me 
through even in the first half where 

62
00:03:24,641 --> 00:03:27,130
there's no medley.
The arrangement has thrust.

63
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,560
I mean,
just imagine the change in feeling.

64
00:03:29,561 --> 00:03:32,830
If the album began with say,
maxwells silver hammer.

65
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:41,710
Now imagine the change and feeling 
reservoir dogs began here.

66
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:50,980
Sales when motherfuckers Kev is doing a 
job and take a big fat guess.

67
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:51,853
Once on a team.
The sequencing and reservoir dogs has 

68
00:03:53,401 --> 00:03:55,920
the same natural rhythm as an album 
cycle does.

69
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:56,993
Offering a variety in tempo from intense
too reflective and back while linking 

70
00:04:01,411 --> 00:04:02,244
corresponding scenes together.
All Terentino's films are constructed 

71
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:06,390
this way,
like albums,

72
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,400
more like albums.
I think that novels,

73
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:10,850
even the ones with more straightforward 
narrative

74
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:14,523
black

75
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,033
coming up with an idea is to go through 
that record room and go through those 

76
00:04:22,491 --> 00:04:27,491
records and to kind of find the music or
the personality of a given movie.

77
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,753
It's like I'm,
I'm looking for the rhythm that this 

78
00:04:30,201 --> 00:04:31,034
movie needs to play and I'm looking for 
the spirit and the rhythm that this 

79
00:04:33,861 --> 00:04:34,694
movie needs to play it.
The other thing that Tarantino is most 

80
00:04:36,471 --> 00:04:40,430
known for is his dialogue and of course 
some of the references in reservoir dogs

81
00:04:40,431 --> 00:04:41,780
have an aged so well.

82
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,311
Well,
you know,

83
00:04:42,311 --> 00:04:47,311
she looked like she looked like Christie
love TV.

84
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:54,953
Oh yeah.
Nobody today remembers the show get 

85
00:04:59,521 --> 00:05:00,354
Christie love,
but what's more important here is the 

86
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:04,290
concept.
People still talk about TV shows.

87
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:05,124
Entertainment is still a common language
between strangers picking genre 

88
00:05:08,431 --> 00:05:10,990
characters and genres situation.
Alright.

89
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:11,963
And giving them a real life spin have 
them sound like real people like me and 

90
00:05:16,711 --> 00:05:17,544
my friends and just other people and 
make references that other people make 

91
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,123
of war dogs translates into 2017 because
the humanity and the comedy that 

92
00:05:24,331 --> 00:05:28,500
Tarantino breathed into genre films is 
still felt all over

93
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:33,770
footloose and in a great hero named 
Kevin Bacon

94
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,640
teaches an entire city full of people 
with sticks up their butts that dancing.

95
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:45,710
So greatest thing there is I think the 
only context in which reservoir dogs has

96
00:05:45,711 --> 00:05:46,544
an age so well is within Terentino's own
demography for all the purchase it has 

97
00:05:50,631 --> 00:05:52,610
on film,
culture and popular culture.

98
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,400
It's still very clearly his most amateur
movie.

99
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:56,503
It's impossible to say how would be 
received today if it was released 

100
00:05:58,821 --> 00:06:02,990
because so much of cinema in the past 25
years is influenced by the style.

101
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:07,490
But I think siskel and Ebert got pretty 
close in their original reviews.

102
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:10,970
I liked that movie as far as it went.
I wanted it to go further and try more.

103
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:12,260
I had the same reaction,
Roger,

104
00:06:12,261 --> 00:06:16,940
that it was a lot of exercise in style,
but then I got that really quick.

105
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:19,490
I mean I understand what he's trying to 
do here,

106
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:22,430
which is which is to show things in 
crime,

107
00:06:22,431 --> 00:06:26,150
movies that crime movies don't show,
for example,

108
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,160
the sloppiness,
the humor,

109
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,520
but we get that within 15 minutes.

110
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:32,383
The missing piece to reservoir dogs is 
the deeper character studies and 

111
00:06:35,151 --> 00:06:39,650
exploration of big ideas that you get in
pulp fiction and Jackie Brown,

112
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:42,230
inglorious bastards and Django 
unchained.

113
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,393
However,
I do think that there is one point in 

114
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:48,950
reservoir dogs were Tarantino does reach
for something deeper.

115
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,473
The commode story sequence,
all of Tarantino's work comments on the 

116
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:54,914
nature of storytelling itself,
but the part when Mr Orange and 

117
00:06:57,591 --> 00:07:02,210
undercover cop learns a fake story to 
sell the criminals on his credibility is

118
00:07:02,211 --> 00:07:05,240
one of the best instances of this in all
his movies.

119
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:08,540
He splits the sequence into four parts 
are in learning the scene,

120
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:10,100
orange,
rehearsing the scene,

121
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:12,470
orange performing the story for an 
audience.

122
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:13,603
Then finally the story coming alive.
It's an elegant illustration of how 

123
00:07:17,121 --> 00:07:17,954
words can transform into stories and 
stories into reality or into movies and 

124
00:07:23,511 --> 00:07:24,344
it's a nice touch that the only thing 
that keeps the cops from noticing the 

125
00:07:26,511 --> 00:07:27,344
drugs is the similar storytelling 
situation because stories can keep us 

126
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:33,020
from seeing reality too.

127
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:33,983
Buddy,
I'm going to shoot you in the face if 

128
00:07:37,411 --> 00:07:39,450
you don't put your hands on the dash

129
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,433
as an exercise in genre and style.
Reservoir dogs is super one of the best 

130
00:07:44,461 --> 00:07:48,210
in film and if it falls just short of 
the transcendent heights,

131
00:07:48,211 --> 00:07:49,950
that Tarantino would later go on to 
reach,

132
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,550
but that's not really a criticism 
because I mean,

133
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:54,563
let's see.
You try to reach just short of 

134
00:07:56,221 --> 00:07:57,054
transcendent with your first movie.
I think a good rule of thumb for how 

135
00:08:00,121 --> 00:08:04,470
well films have aged is simply whether 
or not we keep watching them.

136
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:05,963
Twenty five years on.
I'm still watching reservoir dogs and 

137
00:08:09,061 --> 00:08:13,970
I'll bet that it'll still be true 25 
years and more from that.

138
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,380
Hey everybody,
thank you so much for watching.

139
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,540

149
00:08:46,411 --> 00:08:48,960
called March comes like a lion on a 
crunchy roll.

150
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,110
It's a show about a 70 year old shogi 
player show.

151
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,600
He is a Japanese form variation on 
chest.

152
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,370
Really good.
It's beautiful.

153
00:08:56,371 --> 00:08:58,350
Melancholy.
I think you'll really love it.

154
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:59,880
Also,
Adam savages,

155
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:02,940
one day builds on tested is just a great
time.

156
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:03,923
All the shows are in hd and ad free.
I definitely recommend checking out the 

157
00:09:06,871 --> 00:09:08,670
verve APP.
I'll see you guys next time.
