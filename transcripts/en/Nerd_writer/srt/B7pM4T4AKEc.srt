00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:03,210
Biblically,
boop and Gobbledy Goop,

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:05,940
coffee on a Tuesday and blog,
41.

3
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:17,280
Okay.

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,870
Reading over last week,
Sunday Times,

5
00:00:18,871 --> 00:00:21,190
I came across this article by Christie 
Wampole,

6
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:22,373
how to live without irony,
airs out certain grievances and 

7
00:00:25,231 --> 00:00:29,610
irritation she has about hipsters.
The archetype she says of ironic living,

8
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:30,503
the hipster haunts every city,
street and university town manifesting 

9
00:00:33,181 --> 00:00:35,310
enough style for times he never lived 
himself.

10
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:38,790
This contemporary urban harlequin 
appropriates outmoded fashions,

11
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:40,320
the mustache,
tidy shorts,

12
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,730
mechanisms,
fixed gear,

13
00:00:41,731 --> 00:00:44,100
bicycles,
portable record players and hobbies,

14
00:00:44,101 --> 00:00:44,934
homebrewing playing trombone.
He harvests awkwardness and 

15
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:49,590
selfconsciousness before he makes any 
choice.

16
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:53,880
He has proceeded through several stages 
of self scrutiny and wouldn't it be nice

17
00:00:53,881 --> 00:00:54,714
if columnists proceeded through those 
same several stages of self scrutiny 

18
00:00:57,421 --> 00:00:58,254
themselves.
She continues to exhibit ironic 

19
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:00,930
tendencies.
For example,

20
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,180
I find it difficult to give sincere 
gifts.

21
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,280
Instead,
I often give what in the past would have

22
00:01:05,281 --> 00:01:07,830
been accepted only at a white elephant 
gift exchange,

23
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,753
a kitschy painting from a thrift store 
or a coffee mug with flashy images of 

24
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:12,330
Texas,
the lone star,

25
00:01:12,331 --> 00:01:14,610
state plastic Mexican wrestler figures.

26
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:15,623
The simple act of noticing myself 
defensive behavior has made me think 

27
00:01:18,571 --> 00:01:21,900
deeply about how potentially toxic,
ironic posturing could be.

28
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:22,763
The simple act of noticing myself 
defensive behavior has made me think 

29
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:26,184
deeply about how potentially maybe I'm 
guessing that you guys are bad gift 

30
00:01:30,151 --> 00:01:30,811
givers to.
Right.

31
00:01:30,811 --> 00:01:31,644
Okay,
so the crux of this article is that 

32
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:33,384
ironic living exemplified by hipsters is
a defense mechanism that allows us to 

33
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:40,800
evade the vulnerable intensity of naked 
personal interaction.

34
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:41,634
She hangs a lot of this on the digital 
toys we carry around with us and a deep 

35
00:01:44,701 --> 00:01:48,810
desire for sentimentality and nostalgia 
and I must say that nostalgia,

36
00:01:48,811 --> 00:01:53,180
sentimentality and defense mechanisms 
are all conditions that I suffer from.

37
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,053
They also happen to be numbers 12,
35 and 63 respectively of the human 

38
00:01:57,571 --> 00:01:59,730
condition for a full list of the human 
conditions.

39
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,800
You can visit yourself and yet even if I
suffer from these symptoms,

40
00:02:04,801 --> 00:02:05,634
I don't know that you could diagnose me 
with the supposedly endemic of ironic 

41
00:02:08,581 --> 00:02:08,820
living.

42
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,890
Really.
I don't know anyone.

43
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:13,350
When you get down to it,
who you could diagnose with that.

44
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,213
After I came back from Paris,
the most frequent question I was asked 

45
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,393
was not really a question at all,
more of a statement with a question 

46
00:02:20,101 --> 00:02:21,030
mark.
At the end of the French,

47
00:02:21,031 --> 00:02:22,480
people don't like Americans,
right?

48
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:25,680
This I found perplexing because for the 
six months that I lived there,

49
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,633
not a single French person treated me 
poorly for my Americanness and 

50
00:02:30,331 --> 00:02:33,330
affliction I am no doubt soaked.
In fact,

51
00:02:33,331 --> 00:02:34,164
the people I met there were so generous.
The relationships so easily formed and 

52
00:02:37,201 --> 00:02:38,034
quickly deep that I was doubly perplexed
by the stereotype to these people I 

53
00:02:41,101 --> 00:02:42,090
answered.
Invariably,

54
00:02:42,091 --> 00:02:44,160
every man is his own man.
Every woman,

55
00:02:44,161 --> 00:02:48,090
her own woman kind people like to be 
treated kindly and French.

56
00:02:48,091 --> 00:02:48,924
People who walk around with sad faces 
like to be asked what's wrong in France 

57
00:02:52,231 --> 00:02:53,064
and at home,
I have friends who have typewriters and 

58
00:02:54,421 --> 00:02:55,254
fixed gear bicycles who brew their own 
beer and cover their walls with stuff 

59
00:02:58,201 --> 00:02:59,560
they found on the side of the street.

60
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:02,410
Some are politically active.
Others not so much.

61
00:03:02,411 --> 00:03:05,620
Some are certain who they are and what 
they want to do.

62
00:03:05,621 --> 00:03:08,470
Others not so much.
Sometimes they look at their phones when

63
00:03:08,471 --> 00:03:09,304
I talked to them,
other times they walk around with sad 

64
00:03:10,931 --> 00:03:11,764
faces.
I asked them what's wrong and they tell 

65
00:03:13,871 --> 00:03:15,520
me.
Sometimes they ask me.

66
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:16,383
Finally one Paul writes,
what will future generations make of 

67
00:03:18,491 --> 00:03:22,090
this ramp and sarcasm and unapologetic 
cultivation of silliness.

68
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,073
Will we be satisfied to leave an archive
filled with video clips of people doing 

69
00:03:25,931 --> 00:03:27,880
stupid things?
Stupid things,

70
00:03:27,881 --> 00:03:31,060
Huh?
Exhibit a Charlie McDonald's last video.

71
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,550
I'm scared.
Exhibit B,

72
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:37,930
Nine hundred and 21,835
views.

73
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:40,120
Exhibit C,
40,000.

74
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:40,983
Seventy two comments.
I'm proud to be part of an archive of 

75
00:03:43,661 --> 00:03:44,494
passionate people saying sincere things 
and I'm convinced that what we do is 

76
00:03:49,181 --> 00:03:52,450
contagious and if I may be so bold as to
state a common mission,

77
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:53,523
it's to circulate with force the notion 
that every person is at all times going 

78
00:03:58,511 --> 00:03:59,344
through something and that it's not 
right to judge individuals based on 

79
00:04:02,261 --> 00:04:05,680
groups if it is at any time,
right to judge individuals.

80
00:04:05,681 --> 00:04:06,940
Period.
A simple message,

81
00:04:06,941 --> 00:04:07,774
but a strong one and I was sure that 
understanding it was part of the 

82
00:04:11,531 --> 00:04:14,800
interview process for professors at 
Princeton University.

83
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,150
Don't get me started.
I'm really professors

84
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:27,620
tell me that the system can be that.
