1
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:02,190
Wait,
where am I?

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:03,023
Wait mcgriddles log,
11 thanksgiving time when we celebrate 

3
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:19,740
all where things were for a time for 
family,

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:20,993
good food,
a time to relax with a good football 

5
00:00:22,921 --> 00:00:23,754
game and some beers.
The holiday can be traced to a feast in 

6
00:00:26,281 --> 00:00:27,114
16,
21 on Plymouth plantation in 

7
00:00:28,771 --> 00:00:29,604
Massachusetts was a good harvest year 
due in part to the corn growing skills 

8
00:00:32,581 --> 00:00:36,810
taught to the settlers by squantum 
pawtuxet into quote Edward winslow

9
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:41,440
would be not always so plentiful as it 
was at this time with us.

10
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:42,783
Yet by the goodness of God,
we are so far from that we often wish 

11
00:00:46,871 --> 00:00:48,300
you partakers of our planet.

12
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,233
It's at this time of year that I'm often
reminded of Robert De Niro's great 

13
00:00:51,461 --> 00:00:54,190
comeback movie of 2009.
Everybody's fine.

14
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:14,660
No true,
true apartment and no

15
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:29,291
wait,
wait,

16
00:01:29,291 --> 00:01:29,561
wait,
wait.

17
00:01:29,561 --> 00:01:31,060
What the hell is this?
I just wanted to talk about.

18
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,780
You're saying that I can't talk about 
Bobby [inaudible] great comeback role in

19
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:36,850
2009.
Oh,

20
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,153
so there's a bill in the House of 
Representatives right now called the 

21
00:01:40,151 --> 00:01:44,380
Stop online piracy act or so.
Not many people know about it,

22
00:01:44,381 --> 00:01:46,780
but those of us who have are Horcrux is 
online.

23
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,120
You know that the Internet is and why 
are they doing well?

24
00:01:49,121 --> 00:01:51,280
It's because many of them believed that 
this Bill Sopa,

25
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,143
which the house is very quickly and 
quietly trying to push through to 

26
00:01:53,681 --> 00:01:54,514
passing,
represents an infringement on their 

27
00:01:56,171 --> 00:01:57,004
basic rights of free speech.
Let's take a minute to understand what 

28
00:01:59,231 --> 00:02:01,600
sofa is and how it works.
Private companies,

29
00:02:01,601 --> 00:02:04,000
namely large corporations within the 
entertainment industry,

30
00:02:04,001 --> 00:02:05,710
the Motion Picture Association of 
America,

31
00:02:05,711 --> 00:02:07,720
the recording industry,
Association of America,

32
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:10,780
Netflix via content,
the ability to shut down on unauthorized

33
00:02:10,781 --> 00:02:13,660
roque sites where people download tv 
shows music and move.

34
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,553
Now,
they already have the right to do this 

35
00:02:15,011 --> 00:02:17,290
under American copyright law on an 
individual basis.

36
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,153
You may have seen this screen before,
but a lot of these sites operating from 

37
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,110
outside the US and so are in each 
jurisdiction,

38
00:02:23,111 --> 00:02:23,944
so we'll will allow the government to 
force US Internet providers to block 

39
00:02:26,351 --> 00:02:28,490
access to domain names that carry this.
Con.

40
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:29,363
Corporations can also sue under so,
but any search engine that lists these 

41
00:02:31,871 --> 00:02:34,600
sites and their result or any blog 
reform that provides the Linkedin,

42
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:35,493
but sofa has another.
This log is corporations and the 

43
00:02:37,601 --> 00:02:38,434
government,
the ability to choke the funding of 

44
00:02:39,731 --> 00:02:42,700
websites by forcing advertisers and 
payment services,

45
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,170
pay pow,
mastercard,

46
00:02:44,171 --> 00:02:46,900
visa from doing business with them from 
the time the claim is filed,

47
00:02:46,901 --> 00:02:47,734
the service would have five days to 
separate the infringing website or risk 

48
00:02:50,741 --> 00:02:51,574
persecution.
What do you think payment service 

49
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:54,010
providers will do given the choice?

50
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,730
It's economic submission and Internet 
death panel.

51
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:57,583
Copyright Law is certainly in port 
credit compensation should be provided 

52
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:02,440
to artists who sell their work under 
copyright.

53
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:03,603
They deserve to be protect.
The problem with sofas is that though 

54
00:03:05,081 --> 00:03:05,914
protection isn't stated aim,
the law won't be effective against 

55
00:03:08,351 --> 00:03:09,730
content piracy.
For example.

56
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:13,570
He'll still be able to access block 
sites by entering the Ip address instead

57
00:03:13,571 --> 00:03:14,404
of the domain,
but that's not all Sopa might actually 

58
00:03:16,391 --> 00:03:17,224
work against its purpose.
There's a thing you've never heard of 

59
00:03:18,971 --> 00:03:19,804
called the domain name system.
Security extensions or DNS SEC provides 

60
00:03:23,741 --> 00:03:27,520
end to end encryption of domain name.
Making sure that there's no break in the

61
00:03:27,521 --> 00:03:30,640
chain between say citizens bank and its 
customer,

62
00:03:30,641 --> 00:03:34,930
forcing Internet providers to redirect 
allegedly piratical sites to FBI servers

63
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,050
is incompatible with that.
Most experts believe that tampering with

64
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:41,140
the internets registry of domain names 
will result in less security,

65
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:44,380
not more in fact is that hackers and 
pirates have always had a way of binding

66
00:03:44,381 --> 00:03:48,010
cracks and circumventing laws despite 
efforts to stop what many fear about so,

67
00:03:48,011 --> 00:03:48,844
but is its potential to curb and 
discourage innovation in our most 

68
00:03:51,221 --> 00:03:52,170
innovative industry.

69
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,013
The digital marketplace of ideas that 
welcomes every blog and tweet is the 

70
00:03:56,921 --> 00:03:57,754
same one that inspires the next 
generation of innovators to fuel our 

71
00:04:00,971 --> 00:04:03,040
economy.
He will give corporations the ability to

72
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:03,874
target startups,
new search engines or new social media 

73
00:04:06,011 --> 00:04:09,610
platforms if they feel that they're 
filtering isn't good at one lawsuit to a

74
00:04:09,611 --> 00:04:12,550
small fledgling company is usually all 
that it takes.

75
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,860
Even established sites like Tumblr,
youtube,

76
00:04:14,861 --> 00:04:16,700
soundcloud,
and facebook could come under the gun.

77
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,553
Any amount of illegal content could be 
enough to temporarily shut down the 

78
00:04:19,901 --> 00:04:23,030
entire site and violators.
That little baby who likes big.

79
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:30,420
Okay.
Or that guy who makes awesome acapella

80
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:46,490
that these

81
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,630
people could face jail time,
don't send babies to jail.

82
00:04:55,631 --> 00:04:59,470
Representative Lamar Smith from Texas 
announced the legislation last month and

83
00:04:59,471 --> 00:05:00,304
it has bipartisan support.
Also has bipartisan opposition on this 

84
00:05:03,161 --> 00:05:03,994
issue.
Nancy Pelosi and Ron Paul are on the 

85
00:05:05,861 --> 00:05:06,790
same side.
Google,

86
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:07,660
facebook,
twitter,

87
00:05:07,661 --> 00:05:08,494
Zynga,
Zynga,

88
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:09,520
Ebay,
Mazzola,

89
00:05:09,521 --> 00:05:10,480
Yahoo,
aol,

90
00:05:10,481 --> 00:05:11,314
and linkedin issued an open letter to 
key members of Congress last week 

91
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,680
stating that Sopa was a serious risk to 
our industries.

92
00:05:17,681 --> 00:05:18,514
Continue Track of innovation and job 
creation as well as to our nation 

93
00:05:21,501 --> 00:05:24,070
cybersecurity,
and it should be noted that the MPA,

94
00:05:24,071 --> 00:05:26,800
for example,
is a relatively tiny workforce.

95
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,190
When you compare it to the jobs created 
by the inner.

96
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:30,063
I put links to petitions and information
on what representatives you can call in 

97
00:05:32,651 --> 00:05:33,251
the doodling.
Now,

98
00:05:33,251 --> 00:05:36,010
there's a provision in American 
copyright law called fair.

99
00:05:36,011 --> 00:05:39,700
You get grants and exception to 
copyrighted material for the purposes of

100
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,230
commentary,
criticism,

101
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:42,940
news reporting,
research.

102
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:46,540
Here are the four factors used to 
determine whether or not use is fair.

103
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:47,403
The purpose and character of the use,
including whether such use is of a 

104
00:05:49,451 --> 00:05:52,690
commercial nature or is for nonprofit 
educational purposes,

105
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,553
the nature of the copyrighted work,
the amount and substantial ability of 

106
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:56,853
the portion used in relation to the 
copyrighted work as a whole and the 

107
00:05:59,391 --> 00:06:00,224
effect or use upon the potential mark.
So what about my use of Robert De 

108
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,330
Niro's?
Great comeback movie of 2009.

109
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:07,400
Everybody's fine.
Was it fair?

110
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:08,810
Okay.
One purpose and character.

111
00:06:08,811 --> 00:06:09,644
Well,
I'm using the clip to make a point for 

112
00:06:11,391 --> 00:06:14,330
completely nonprofit purpose to the 
nature of the work.

113
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,220
Well,
it's a Hollywood movie.

114
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,990
It's gross.
Sixty dollars million,

115
00:06:17,991 --> 00:06:22,460
$454,850.
It's budget $20 million.

116
00:06:22,461 --> 00:06:24,710
So I'm helping still on DVD.
Okay.

117
00:06:24,711 --> 00:06:26,420
Number three,
the amount used.

118
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:28,910
Okay,
so I used 38 seconds.

119
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,223
Divide that by the run time of 99 
minutes and you get my use of point 

120
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:34,791
zero,
zero,

121
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:35,660
zero,
six,

122
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:36,620
three,
six percent.

123
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:39,020
Finally number four,
the effect on potential market.

124
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:42,290
Did you ever hear of this movie before?
I mentioned it still on DVD.

125
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:45,710
It's plain to see why fair use is 
critically important in our way.

126
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,573
We are now a community of auto didact,
taking the best soup of information and 

127
00:06:50,571 --> 00:06:54,200
consolidating it into coherent stories.
This is how we learned today.

128
00:06:54,201 --> 00:06:55,034
This is how we teach each other.
This is how we start a revolution or 

129
00:06:57,501 --> 00:07:01,520
take a stand or figure out where our 
efforts can be put to the best.

130
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,130
This thanksgiving I'm grateful for.
Fair use.

131
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:08,240
Brought it full circle.
I'm also grateful for friends and family

132
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,940
and speaking of.
I have to get out of here.

133
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,520
Devin miscalculate.
Okay.

134
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:17,600
Okay.
Yeah.

135
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,433
That's more like it.
