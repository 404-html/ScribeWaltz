1
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:07,900
Proliferation of nuclear weapons is a 
detestable artifact of human beings,

2
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:14,140
seemingly ineradicable desire to 
dominate other human beings.

3
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:15,043
Nuclear weapons,
perhaps more than any other manmade 

4
00:00:17,661 --> 00:00:18,494
thing,
represent that uneasy dichotomy between 

5
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:22,003
the brilliant scientific creativity of a
technological achievement and the 

6
00:00:25,821 --> 00:00:29,630
consequences of its function,
its attention that's been explored by so

7
00:00:29,631 --> 00:00:34,460
many thinkers and moralists even by some
of the scientists who work themselves on

8
00:00:34,461 --> 00:00:36,830
the famous or infamous Manhattan.

9
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,530
The only reaction I remember perhaps I 
was blinded by my own reaction,

10
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:41,883
was very considerable elation and 
excitement and I was going to parties 

11
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:52,041
and people got drunk and it would make a
tremendous interesting contrast what was

12
00:00:58,021 --> 00:01:02,130
going on in Los Alamos at the same time 
as what was going on in Hiroshima.

13
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,093
Nuclear weapons have been tested over 
2000 times since little boy and fat men 

14
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,393
were dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima 
for tests and demonstrations for civil 

15
00:01:13,811 --> 00:01:15,490
engineering purposes,
moving land,

16
00:01:15,491 --> 00:01:17,710
creating artificial bays,
things like that.

17
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:21,910
There was even an extended US military 
operation called operation.

18
00:01:21,911 --> 00:01:26,410
Plowshare started in 1958 at the height 
of the atomic age,

19
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:30,070
which aim to exploit the quote,
friendly Adam.

20
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:30,933
Plowshare saw the explosion of 35 
nuclear bombs until public outcry shut 

21
00:01:35,441 --> 00:01:36,274
the program down in 1975.
The nuclear industry wanted to 

22
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,083
desensitize the public to the negative 
connotations associated with nuclear 

23
00:01:44,051 --> 00:01:44,884
weapons,
but the problem was that those negative 

24
00:01:47,051 --> 00:01:51,670
connotations were present in every step 
of the program.

25
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,533
Project GNOME vented radioactive steam 
over the very press gallery that was 

26
00:01:56,381 --> 00:01:58,870
called to confirm it safety.
The next blast,

27
00:01:58,930 --> 00:01:59,763
104 kiloton detonation at UCO.
Flat Nevada displays 12 million tons of 

28
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:09,130
soil and resulted in a radioactive dust 
cloud that rose 12,000

29
00:02:09,131 --> 00:02:11,920
feet and plume toward the Mississippi 
River.

30
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:12,783
You can read all about operation plow 
share in the Department of Energy's 

31
00:02:15,311 --> 00:02:18,580
executive summary of the program,
which I'll put in the description below.

32
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,593
Even now,
they seem to talk about it with a kind 

33
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:21,874
of what could have been disappointed.
Plowshare and the hundreds of other 

34
00:02:25,481 --> 00:02:26,314
nuclear tests that have been done since 
its termination deal in the super 

35
00:02:29,861 --> 00:02:33,580
violent production of fundamental 
particles that have a real,

36
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:37,690
almost unbelievable impact on 
environmental makeup.

37
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:38,613
Indeed,
the creation of new chemical elements 

38
00:02:40,181 --> 00:02:41,014
like Einsteinian from and were the 
result of the first thermo nuclear 

39
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:49,291
explosion code named Ivy Mike in 
Nineteen 52 nuclear blast create so much

40
00:02:50,171 --> 00:02:54,580
change in the environment that their 
fingerprint can be felt in fields.

41
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:57,550
On the opposite end of the academic 
spectrum,

42
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:01,690
in 2008 occurred to Russian avant garde 
painting expert Alaina Baster,

43
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:02,733
then curator of the Russian museum in St
Petersburg inundated with a booming 

44
00:03:06,521 --> 00:03:07,354
forgery market that have scientists 
chemically tested the paint in 

45
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:12,310
suspicious canvases.

46
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:13,623
They might find something in its makeup 
which dated the pieces more accurately 

47
00:03:17,891 --> 00:03:18,724
than other methods using a mass 
spectrometer basner and some 

48
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:26,640
artistically minded scientists were able
to see that to isotope caesium 1:37

49
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:28,174
and strontium 90 appeared in greater 
concentration in canvases from after 

50
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:37,420
1945 when the first nuclear weapons were
detonated.

51
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,313
These radioactive vision products are 
ejected from nuclear blast into the 

52
00:03:42,911 --> 00:03:45,820
atmosphere and absorbed into earth,
soil,

53
00:03:45,821 --> 00:03:46,654
and then Earth's plant life,
namely flax plants from which we get 

54
00:03:49,871 --> 00:03:54,871
flaxseed oil or linseed oil,
a major bonding agent and oil paints.

55
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,793
This fills me with such an odd feeling.
Almost all post 1945 oil paintings 

56
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,400
contain a fingerprint of nuclear 
weapons.

57
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,013
Remember that next time you go to your 
local gallery or if ever you lose faith 

58
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,183
in the ironic interconnectedness of all 
things that within our most refined 

59
00:04:17,771 --> 00:04:22,540
creative impulse lurks traces of are 
equally refined,

60
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:26,110
exact opposite impulse for destruction.

61
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,790
Hey everybody,
thanks for watching.

62
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:29,653
There are so many tangents I could have 
gone down with this video and I want it 

63
00:04:32,751 --> 00:04:34,070
to.
I just didn't want to make it too long,

64
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:35,263
but I put a lot of the links and sources
in the description under works cited so 

65
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:39,644
you can read for yourself some of the 
cool stuff about operation cloudshare 

66
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:45,410
about nuclear weapons,
fishing products,

67
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:48,230
art forgeries.
There's just a lot of cool things.

68
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,393
Thank you to everybody who followed me 
on Tumbler and used the ask me anything 

69
00:04:52,641 --> 00:04:56,030
feature to have some discussions about 
some cool stuff about this video,

70
00:04:56,031 --> 00:04:59,240
but other videos I encourage you to keep
doing that.

71
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,313
Tumbler is really cool for,
for doing sort of longer discussions 

72
00:05:04,071 --> 00:05:06,230
about things and I'll see you next week.
