1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:05,090
I didn't know what they,
I'm trying to get him to rap show.

2
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,350
Oh,
new one.

3
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:12,480
Oh my mind just wanders.
Gentleman.

4
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:15,050
Let me give this phone to get around 
this problem.

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,450
Rocket Man.
And they got me wildly,

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,830
but he didn't understand it ain't my 
lady because he understood.

7
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:24,203
Okay.

8
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:29,340
So this is day three of hurricane.
No hurricane sandy aftermath.

9
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:31,143
I am up in a hotel in midtown Manhattan.
My employers and Msnbc were nice enough 

10
00:00:35,681 --> 00:00:37,300
to put me up,
um,

11
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:39,960
for.
I been staying in my friends up in a,

12
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,740
uh,
upper west side.

13
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,750
Great friends,
great employer.

14
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,260
I haven't been back to my place in like 
three days.

15
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:51,460
I'm back down in lower east side,
which is,

16
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,290
you know,
completely without power.

17
00:00:53,291 --> 00:00:54,124
It's a strange situation right now 
because it's like half the city is dark 

18
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,870
half the sit down right now in lower 
Manhattan.

19
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:05,110
It is like Mad Max,
wild west style,

20
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:09,460
you know,
people in dumpsters trying to get food,

21
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,400
crowding around surge protectors to 
charge their cell phones.

22
00:01:12,401 --> 00:01:13,234
It's crazy.
Obviously the power being out is not as 

23
00:01:16,211 --> 00:01:18,370
bad as the way some people have a right 
now,

24
00:01:18,371 --> 00:01:19,510
which is,
you know,

25
00:01:19,511 --> 00:01:22,720
I'm talking about the Jersey shore where
there's just scenes of devastation.

26
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:27,190
Houses are torn up,
people have unfortunately passed away in

27
00:01:27,191 --> 00:01:28,100
the storm.
It's,

28
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:29,110
it's,
it's terrible.

29
00:01:29,111 --> 00:01:31,660
So you really can't complain even for 
what,

30
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:33,220
you know,
they have to go go through down there,

31
00:01:33,221 --> 00:01:35,400
but it's still a very strange and 
surreal sight,

32
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,610
uh,
being,

33
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,640
um,
being in the city and how being in a,

34
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:40,960
in a,
in a really,

35
00:01:40,961 --> 00:01:42,250
what is an island divided

36
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,633
Friday

37
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:52,620
also.
And this,

38
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,910
you just don't surprise,
you don't want to do.

39
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,980
You made it man certain vibe you that 
night to dynamite out of sight.

40
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,770
He doesn't Bite Nice shadow more.
I'm gonna leave,

41
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,900
you know,
but he's a King Ya'll queens,

42
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,043
right?
