1
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:13,763
Here we are,
everybody loves a good movie and the 

2
00:00:16,981 --> 00:00:21,981
genre has a lot of competition.
You've got John Hughes classics like the

3
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,290
Breakfast Club and Ferris Bueller's day 
off nineties,

4
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:29,130
teen romcoms like 10 things I hate about
you and she's all that Richard Linklater

5
00:00:29,131 --> 00:00:30,150
is coming of age,
comedy,

6
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:34,950
dazed and confused or recent hits like 
the fault in our stars and love Simon.

7
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,340
You could even throw all eight Harry 
Potter movies into the mix.

8
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,980
Why not?
But when I search [inaudible] dot com,

9
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,030
which everybody knows is the authority 
on ranking stuff.

10
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:45,893
I'm disappointed to find that my 
favorite teen movie doesn't even crack 

11
00:00:48,751 --> 00:00:52,200
the top 100.
Of course I'm talking about Kenji Ecosoc

12
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,900
whose turn of the millennium 
masterpiece.

13
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:55,590
That.
Okay.

14
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:56,423
Boy,

15
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:06,970
premise of battle royale is really 
simple.

16
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,900
In a dystopian Japan,
a classroom of teenagers is chosen every

17
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:11,733
year and shipped to an island where they
have to fight to the death until only 

18
00:01:14,801 --> 00:01:15,634
one is left standing.
You might recognize this premise from 

19
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:18,933
the hunger games books,
the first of which came out eight years 

20
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:22,413
after battle royale and nine years after
the book by cashew into Cami on which 

21
00:01:26,591 --> 00:01:27,424
it's based.
This concept is also the basis for the 

22
00:01:29,471 --> 00:01:30,304
hugely popular video game,
fortnight battle royale and its 

23
00:01:33,191 --> 00:01:35,440
predecessor player unknown's 
battlegrounds,

24
00:01:35,441 --> 00:01:39,100
which was at least in part,
inspired by Fuka sock who's moving.

25
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,450
Unlike the hunger games,
battle royale is remarkably contained.

26
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,780
There is no larger world,
no political intrigue,

27
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:47,683
plotline.
The audience is just dumped into this 

28
00:01:49,241 --> 00:01:50,074
horrific situation with the characters 
and we experience it shocks as they do 

29
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,000
and they are shocked.

30
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,053
It's definitely a violent movie,
but it's the execution of violence that 

31
00:02:06,271 --> 00:02:07,104
makes battle royale so great.
And this should come as no surprise 

32
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:10,703
though.
I didn't know this when I first saw the 

33
00:02:11,611 --> 00:02:12,444
movie at Summer Camp Age Sixteen.
Battle Royale is the final film of 

34
00:02:16,471 --> 00:02:17,304
Japanese alter Kinji Fuka soccer.
He made this incredibly vigorous film 

35
00:02:22,261 --> 00:02:25,860
about teenagers at age 70,
which is amazing,

36
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:28,350
but by then focus.
Aco was a master,

37
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,490
a criminally underappreciated master of 
Japanese in world cinema.

38
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,593
He made his mark on the industry in the 
19 seventies with a breathtaking series 

39
00:02:37,171 --> 00:02:38,004
of films about Japanese gangsters,
the Yakuza in the chaos after World War 

40
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,083
II.
Unlike the more traditional Yakuza 

41
00:02:44,101 --> 00:02:44,934
films,
Fuka Socceroos movies have a wild manic 

42
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:50,370
energy to them.
The camera work is designed to throw you

43
00:02:50,371 --> 00:02:52,020
into the action.
It's a thrilling,

44
00:02:52,021 --> 00:02:52,854
disorienting experience to watch them 
and whose message in those films comes 

45
00:02:56,581 --> 00:03:00,430
through loud and clear in a society by 
war,

46
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,690
friendship,
comradery.

47
00:03:01,691 --> 00:03:06,040
Even the famous codes of honor of the 
Coosa only stretch so far.

48
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:11,020
It was truly every man for himself,
and if someone could get an advantage by

49
00:03:11,021 --> 00:03:14,650
betraying his friend,
he was more likely to do it than not.

50
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:15,923
It took a sack whose films?
The honorable ones are often the first 

51
00:03:18,641 --> 00:03:19,474
to be killed.

52
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,110
Yeah,
he killed him.

53
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:31,700
Him have to be in a custody can you 
highlight one night every night

54
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:34,003
in battle royale,
the same philosophy holds in the chaos 

55
00:03:36,561 --> 00:03:37,394
of the game.
The speed at which friends turn into 

56
00:03:39,021 --> 00:03:42,110
enemies can give you whiplash and the 
violence,

57
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:45,790
the violence of the films is sudden 
devastate.

58
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,870
As a viewer,
it's like you're one of the students.

59
00:03:47,871 --> 00:03:48,704
It all comes so fast at the beginning 
that you just want to pause and get a 

60
00:03:51,441 --> 00:03:53,990
grip on things,
but there's no time for them.

61
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:57,770
The ones who trust too liberally are the
ones who get killed.

62
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,753
First,
it may seem like battle royale is a 

63
00:04:00,411 --> 00:04:04,310
fable of nihilism with mindless,
brutal killing,

64
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,173
doled out to anyone and everyone,
but the violence in [inaudible] whose 

65
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:11,900
vision has a purpose,
like all great team movies,

66
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:16,990
Battle Royale is really about 
friendships that may be a little hard to

67
00:04:21,321 --> 00:04:22,154
see,
but focus on who's interested in what 

68
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:24,554
friendship really means when the gloves 
are off in the most barbaric 

69
00:04:28,221 --> 00:04:29,054
circumstances.
What does human connection mean in the 

70
00:04:31,251 --> 00:04:35,780
context of humanity's capacity for 
unspeakable violence?

71
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:39,980
At that time,
unspeakable violence was very much alive

72
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,590
in the memory of the older generation in
Japan.

73
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:47,810
It tested them in ways that the younger 
generation couldn't begin to understand.

74
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:51,920
This is what life was like for fruit 
soco himself when he was 15,

75
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,780
the same age as the students in the 
film,

76
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:59,010
so you know,
she,

77
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:05,943
she,
she was really not that much data on my 

78
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,010
level.
You Eel know.

79
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,790
I'm like,
you want to look that up?

80
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:23,370
So do you want your pillows

81
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,833
in the movie?
It's almost as if the older generation 

82
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:28,563
represented by a teacher devices the 
game as a way to communicate their 

83
00:05:33,101 --> 00:05:33,934
experiences with the youth and it's 
almost as if he made the film for the 

84
00:05:38,861 --> 00:05:39,694
same reason.
Battle Royale is interested in the kind 

85
00:05:41,891 --> 00:05:45,190
of friendship that can't be explored at 
high school.

86
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:49,060
It's friendship tainted by a deeply 
cruel world,

87
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:54,070
but it's all the more poignant when it 
persists in spite of that fact.

88
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:02,470
Well,
Michael saw sick idea.

89
00:06:02,471 --> 00:06:07,471
It's about the last movie is a lot of 
things.

90
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,950
It's Blackley comical.
It's scary.

91
00:06:15,951 --> 00:06:20,570
It's a naked look at humanity and it's a
gripping piece of balls to the wall.

92
00:06:20,571 --> 00:06:25,550
Entertainment directed by a man with a 
lifetime of skill and experience.

93
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,133
It's a teen movie and it deserves to be 
considered with the very best of that 

94
00:06:30,981 --> 00:06:31,814
genre.

95
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,380
Hey everybody,
thank you so much for watching.

96
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,960

99
00:06:54,601 --> 00:06:56,010
security.
You know what?

100
00:06:56,011 --> 00:06:59,220
I learned photoshop,
I learned it through a weird mishmash of

101
00:06:59,221 --> 00:07:03,060
disconnected youtube videos and I think 
the process would have gone a lot faster

102
00:07:03,061 --> 00:07:06,510
and better if there was a class 
dedicated to teaching me everything that

103
00:07:06,511 --> 00:07:09,060
program could do in a more systematic 
way.

104

That's what skillshare offers.
Learning new skills is really valuable 

105
00:07:12,451 --> 00:07:14,340
to me because whenever I learned a new 
skill,

106
00:07:14,341 --> 00:07:17,310
it's like a bunch of new ideas are 
unlocked in my head.

107
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:20,670
I think what can I do with this,
and that always,

108
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:24,990
always helps me with writer's block.
