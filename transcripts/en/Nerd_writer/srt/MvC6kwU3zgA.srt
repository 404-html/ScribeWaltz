1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,240
Because government I wrong the people

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:06,110
you know,
I believe in government.

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:07,910
There are things that can't do of 
course,

4
00:00:07,911 --> 00:00:11,900
but I think the government has had a 
positive effect in the lives of millions

5
00:00:11,901 --> 00:00:15,770
of people and yet no matter where you 
fall on the political spectrum,

6
00:00:15,771 --> 00:00:18,950
it's hard to argue with those who 
criticize government for the way that it

7
00:00:18,951 --> 00:00:22,370
allocates and spends the money that it 
takes out of our paychecks.

8
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:27,620
The US government is a vast bureaucracy 
prone to waste and redundant spending,

9
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:28,723
and this is because it doesn't do what 
most of us would consider to be common 

10
00:00:30,741 --> 00:00:31,574
sense.
It doesn't make decisions based on 

11
00:00:34,251 --> 00:00:35,084
evidence or setting priorities and 
making sure tax dollars are spent 

12
00:00:37,701 --> 00:00:38,534
wisely.
American can be compassionate and 

13
00:00:41,811 --> 00:00:42,644
responsible at the same time.
Let me just give you an example of what 

14
00:00:44,781 --> 00:00:46,370
I'm talking about.
In 2005,

15
00:00:46,371 --> 00:00:47,204
George W Bush signed the deficit 
reduction act and that bill set up a 

16
00:00:50,211 --> 00:00:53,540
council to figure out how many federal 
programs we're spending money on,

17
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:55,610
things that were actually working.

18
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:56,743
The council found that for example,
the government was funding 105 stem 

19
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:03,350
education initiatives totaling 
$3,000,000,000

20
00:01:03,351 --> 00:01:04,184
in 2006 of those 105,
only 10 pet evaluations that were 

21
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:09,374
scientifically worth a damn,
and of those 10 just for were found to 

22
00:01:12,801 --> 00:01:17,720
be effective for out of 105 for 
$3,000,000,000.

23
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:18,643
You can find ugly statistics like that 
all throughout the government and the 

24
00:01:21,681 --> 00:01:22,514
reason is because spending decisions in 
Washington and in the states too by the 

25
00:01:25,191 --> 00:01:26,024
way,
are made on things like costs on public 

26
00:01:27,801 --> 00:01:28,634
opinion,
on the pressure from lobbyists and on 

27
00:01:30,351 --> 00:01:33,860
the particular political ideology of 
parties and politicians.

28
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:37,010
In other words,
everything but evidence.

29
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:37,933
I mean you read essays on evidence based
policy and you invariably come across 

30
00:01:40,461 --> 00:01:41,294
sentences like the rise and promotion of
evidence-based orientations within 

31
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:44,983
government agencies is consistent with 
the public sector's increased interest 

32
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:49,123
in efficiency and effectiveness as if 
before they were primarily concerned 

33
00:01:52,521 --> 00:01:55,100
with inefficiency and ineffectiveness.

34
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:57,343
Back to the video.
Everything about life in our 

35
00:01:58,731 --> 00:02:01,730
technocratic society is hyper efficient.
I mean,

36
00:02:01,731 --> 00:02:02,564
Google just came out with a function for
web searching within the messaging APP 

37
00:02:05,451 --> 00:02:07,210
because switching apps is,
you know,

38
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,053
like really unproductive.
I think the feeling is that we're 

39
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:12,164
getting more efficient by orders of 
magnitude while government is just 

40
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:17,450
taking a lot of time switching between 
apps.

41
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:18,703
The result of that is frustration and 
the result of frustration is one of the 

42
00:02:21,561 --> 00:02:26,510
great sleazebags of our time.
Why can't we use science and evidence to

43
00:02:26,511 --> 00:02:28,460
improve government?
How would it even work?

44
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:29,623
Well,
applying evidence to social programs 

45
00:02:30,711 --> 00:02:31,544
involves a few things,
but the most important is something 

46
00:02:33,321 --> 00:02:34,154
called randomized control trials.
This means randomly selecting a large 

47
00:02:37,971 --> 00:02:40,850
number of people,
splitting them into two groups where one

48
00:02:40,851 --> 00:02:41,684
group gets the benefits of the 
programming question while the other 

49
00:02:43,461 --> 00:02:44,294
group,
the control group doesn't and these 

50
00:02:45,561 --> 00:02:48,860
groups aren't monitored over a long 
period taken from medicine.

51
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:49,693
Randomized control trials are the gold 
standard for determining how effective 

52
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:56,720
something really is.
A government can apply this to policy by

53
00:02:56,721 --> 00:02:57,554
offering money only to the programs do 
this kind of research and by attaching 

54
00:03:01,751 --> 00:03:02,584
the condition that scientifically 
rigorous evaluations must be kept up 

55
00:03:06,131 --> 00:03:08,650
over time or the money will disappear.
Now,

56
00:03:08,651 --> 00:03:10,330
of course,
if you're going to go down this road,

57
00:03:10,331 --> 00:03:13,660
you have to be willing to hear results 
that you might not like.

58
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,240
One of the most rigorous studies ever in
this field,

59
00:03:16,241 --> 00:03:17,074
for example,
was the head start impact study plan 

60
00:03:19,421 --> 00:03:20,254
during the Clinton years implemented 
during the Bush years and reported just 

61
00:03:23,081 --> 00:03:26,490
before Obama's reelection in 2012.
The study found that headstart,

62
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,333
the program that aimed to help children 
in poverty had by the end of the third 

63
00:03:30,551 --> 00:03:31,384
grade,
very few impacts in any of the four 

64
00:03:33,701 --> 00:03:35,140
domains of cognitive,
social,

65
00:03:35,141 --> 00:03:39,160
emotional health and parenting practices
at a cost of $8,000,000,000

66
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:40,360
a year to the taxpayer.

67
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,670
Those were pretty shocking findings.
Now,

68
00:03:42,671 --> 00:03:43,504
the question is,
does poor spending mean that funding 

69
00:03:45,461 --> 00:03:46,294
should be cut for poverty programs so 
that we should scale back on stem 

70
00:03:49,391 --> 00:03:51,340
initiatives?
I don't think so.

71
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:52,203
In fact,
I think we should increase spending on 

72
00:03:53,231 --> 00:03:54,064
both,
but the money should be given to stuff 

73
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:57,183
that works.
I mean that just makes sense and we 

74
00:03:58,901 --> 00:03:59,734
asked.
Today is not whether our government is 

75
00:04:00,731 --> 00:04:04,030
too big or too small,
but whether it works where the answer is

76
00:04:04,031 --> 00:04:04,864
yes,
we intend to move forward where the 

77
00:04:07,091 --> 00:04:11,890
answer is no programs will end.
Major Kudos has to be given to the Obama

78
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:12,723
Administration for facing the headstart 
results squarely and ordering a full 

79
00:04:15,401 --> 00:04:20,290
review of one of the signature pieces of
liberal legislation in the 20th century.

80
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:21,183
In fact,
evidence based policy has been a 

81
00:04:22,451 --> 00:04:25,510
cornerstone of the Obama agenda in some 
key areas.

82
00:04:25,511 --> 00:04:26,344
There have been some major wins by using
a competitive model of funding that 

83
00:04:29,591 --> 00:04:31,870
requires strong standards of evidence.

84
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:33,043
You know,
evidence based policy doesn't work for 

85
00:04:33,761 --> 00:04:34,594
everything,
but that any administration managed to 

86
00:04:36,491 --> 00:04:37,324
shoe horn science in among the other 
legislative pressures is a major 

87
00:04:41,171 --> 00:04:42,760
accomplishment.
Of course,

88
00:04:42,761 --> 00:04:43,594
you won't ever hear about 
accomplishments like this on the news 

89
00:04:46,181 --> 00:04:50,530
because this stuff is incredibly boring,
but that's part of the problem.

90
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:54,880
Under the sensationalism of the media 
and the squabbling of political parties.

91
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,013
There is a deep,
boring ocean of governance where 

92
00:04:59,561 --> 00:05:00,394
tedious,
but crucial work is being done every 

93
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,873
day.
I think it's part of our responsibility 

94
00:05:05,231 --> 00:05:09,130
to wade into that ocean every once in 
awhile and tune out the noise.

95
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:11,140
If you do,
who knows,

96
00:05:11,141 --> 00:05:11,974
maybe you'll find something in there 
that'll make you believe in government 

97
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:19,390
to everybody.
Thanks for watching.

98
00:05:19,391 --> 00:05:20,224
I have to give a heartfelt thanks to 
everybody who supports this gentle on 

99
00:05:22,311 --> 00:05:23,144
Patrion by pledging a dollar or $3 per 
video because that allows me to put a 

100
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:27,034
lot of work into a video like this with 
ideas that I think are important and 

101
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:32,470
fascinating,
but not very click bait,

102
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:36,550
so thank you for that freedom.
I don't take it lightly and I'll see you

103
00:05:36,551 --> 00:05:38,020
guys next Wednesday.
