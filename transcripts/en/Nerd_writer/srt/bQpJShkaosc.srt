00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,470
Hello little peanuts and porcupines 
coffee on a Tuesday and Vlog 55.

2
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:15,920
Okay.

3
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,350
I love superheroes and I love good 
movies.

4
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:21,830
Put those two things together and I go 
fucking bananas.

5
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,750
One of my favorite superhero movies is 
of course Sam Raimi,

6
00:00:24,751 --> 00:00:25,584
amy's original spider man.
Not only because it's brilliant 

7
00:00:27,591 --> 00:00:28,424
storytelling and it is,
but because that movie really conveys 

8
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:34,340
the grace,
the almost balletic movement of our hero

9
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,353
through the New York City skyline.
What gives spiderman his agility is a 

10
00:00:37,521 --> 00:00:41,600
combination of heightened reflexes and a
pre-cognitive spider sense.

11
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:42,443
After that,
super strengthened some handy webs and 

12
00:00:44,451 --> 00:00:46,700
you have the best time.
This side of Superman.

13
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:47,563
Indeed.
I've spent countless hours walking 

14
00:00:48,351 --> 00:00:51,410
through city staring wistfully up at 
buildings as the other me.

15
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,393
The Spiderman may swings here and there 
and deep parabolic arcs twisting into 

16
00:00:55,791 --> 00:00:56,960
triple flips,
landing.

17
00:00:56,961 --> 00:00:59,900
I don't know on the poll,
some American flag atop the empire state

18
00:00:59,901 --> 00:01:00,734
building.

19
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:05,960
Okay.
I lost myself there a little bit though.

20
00:01:05,961 --> 00:01:06,794
I've been known to loiter around the 
spider exhibit at the Natural History 

21
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:09,763
Museum.
It's a real human tragedy that we don't 

22
00:01:10,731 --> 00:01:11,960
get to have super powers.
I mean,

23
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:12,913
the best we can do is free running and 
by we I of course mean other people and 

24
00:01:16,581 --> 00:01:17,414
yet there are times when walking through
the densely populated spaces of 

25
00:01:20,031 --> 00:01:20,864
Manhattan that I've marveled at my 
ability to move through a crowd and not 

26
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,093
crash into every other person.
Sometimes I can actually feel myself 

27
00:01:28,701 --> 00:01:29,534
perceiving the speed and crisscrossing 
directionality of all the people in 

28
00:01:32,901 --> 00:01:35,240
front of me and when I get to the other 
side,

29
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:38,510
I feel like a regular Han Solo.
What is that?

30
00:01:38,511 --> 00:01:41,300
Why aren't we a mess in airports or on 
street corners?

31
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:45,080
How are we all avoiding one another when
we look out onto a moving crowd,

32
00:01:45,081 --> 00:01:45,914
but we're actually seeing beyond busy 
people talking on their cell phones is 

33
00:01:48,681 --> 00:01:49,514
subtle increases and decreases in the 
intensity of light reflecting off 

34
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:56,980
objects when light intensity increases 
and object is moving towards you.

35
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:59,660
Usually when it decreases,
it's moving farther away,

36
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:01,970
but the retina is also sensing 
directionality.

37
00:02:01,971 --> 00:02:06,230
Neurons fire and in code as they sense 
edges moving over backgrounds in time,

38
00:02:06,231 --> 00:02:07,064
and we have separate groups of neurons 
dedicated to perceiving things moving 

39
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,260
left or right or clockwise or 
counterclockwise.

40
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,880
Perceive your own sense of 
directionality and action.

41
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:17,450
Fix Your eyes on the center of this 
animation.

42
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,300
What I'm about to show you is what's 
called the waterfall,

43
00:02:20,301 --> 00:02:24,410
illusion or motion after effect.
Stare at a waterfall for long enough and

44
00:02:24,411 --> 00:02:27,110
the neuron group coding it's downward 
motion,

45
00:02:27,111 --> 00:02:28,730
will,
for lack of a better term,

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,820
get bored and adapt to make that the 
norm.

47
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:32,683
Turn your head away to say a stationary 
rock and the rock will seem to move 

48
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,600
upward in the opposite direction of the 
false.

49
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:39,583
That's because the stationary thing 
relative to the adapted normal is 

50
00:02:43,011 --> 00:02:46,490
actually up or instead of circles moving
inward,

51
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:50,510
this pattern may look like it's moving 
outward.

52
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:51,950
Add to this,
our eyes on average,

53
00:02:51,951 --> 00:02:56,420
separated by six centimeters are 
remarkably accurate at triangulating and

54
00:02:56,421 --> 00:02:58,730
object as long as it's within 100 
meters.

55
00:02:58,731 --> 00:02:59,564
If it's beyond 100 meters,
we have to rely on other tricks like 

56
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:05,320
perspective or motion parallax taking 
all this information,

57
00:03:05,321 --> 00:03:08,920
the brain can calculate the velocity of 
a variety of moving things at once.

58
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:10,480
The Retina,
which we should never forget,

59
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:15,070
is the only visible part of the brain 
carries information via the optic nerve.

60
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:15,933
To the lateral geniculate nucleus and 
into the visual cortex in the occipital 

61
00:03:19,421 --> 00:03:20,800
lobe of the brain.
From here,

62
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:25,060
the data splinters down two paths.
The two stream hypothesis made famous by

63
00:03:25,061 --> 00:03:27,580
David Milner and Melvin goodale in the 
early nineties,

64
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:28,503
holds that some information goes down 
the ventral stream to the temporal lobe 

65
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:32,403
for object identification and 
recognition so that we can figure out 

66
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,610
what it is that we're looking at.

67
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,473
The rest goes down the dorsal stream to 
the parietal lobe where we process the 

68
00:03:40,781 --> 00:03:43,300
objects spacial location relative to the
viewer.

69
00:03:43,301 --> 00:03:44,830
In other words,
there's two streams,

70
00:03:44,831 --> 00:03:45,664
one for what and one for where what was 
merely color edge and brightness in the 

71
00:03:49,901 --> 00:03:53,290
occipital lobe is a map spatial 
awareness.

72
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:57,130
By the time it reaches the parietal now 
our knowledge of how we process movement

73
00:03:57,131 --> 00:04:00,670
is only as good as our working knowledge
of the brain of grass,

74
00:04:00,671 --> 00:04:01,504
which is to say the least incomplete,
better and find our technologies will 

75
00:04:04,421 --> 00:04:07,390
give way to a better and finer 
understanding of the brain.

76
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,253
But really understanding the brain is 
only a function of our desire to 

77
00:04:11,801 --> 00:04:14,650
understand in order to treat certain 
kinds of brain damage.

78
00:04:14,651 --> 00:04:17,350
What's incredible is that when 
functioning normally,

79
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:18,243
we don't have to think about each and 
every complicated step from perception 

80
00:04:21,641 --> 00:04:25,270
to cognition to actually we can like 
certain heroic walk crawlers,

81
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:26,283
navigate our environment with a natural 
grace in a kind of balletic dance with 

82
00:04:29,681 --> 00:04:32,800
the fast and chaotic movement of 
everything else.

83
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,173
Yeah.

84
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:37,600
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

85
00:04:37,601 --> 00:04:42,601
That was spider sense.
Whatever life holds in store for me,

86
00:04:47,431 --> 00:04:52,431
I will never forget these words with 
great power comes great responsibility.

87
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,760
This is my gift,
my curse.

88
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,180
Who am I?
I'm Spiderman.

89
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:05,623
Uh.
