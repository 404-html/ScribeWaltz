1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,140
Wedged into the middle of the great 
novel,

2
00:00:04,141 --> 00:00:04,974
the hunchback of Notre Dame,
Victor Hugo pauses the narrative to 

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,150
philosophize on the ancient significance
of architecture.

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,013
From the beginning of time he says,
cultures of the Earth wrote their 

5
00:00:16,201 --> 00:00:17,034
thoughts with rock.
They made words by superimposing stone 

6
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:21,533
upon stone.
The Celtic Doma and chrome lack that 

7
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:27,990
trust can tubulus the Hebrew Gal Gal our
words,

8
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:28,853
sometimes on a vast beach.
They join these stone words and wrote a 

9
00:00:31,741 --> 00:00:32,574
sentence.
The traditions had given birth 

10
00:00:33,721 --> 00:00:34,554
dissembles under which they disappeared 
like the trunk of a tree under its 

11
00:00:38,311 --> 00:00:39,144
foliage and the rock symbols had need to
expand into a structure in this way he 

12
00:00:43,801 --> 00:00:44,634
says,
architecture developed concomitantly 

13
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:47,363
with human thought reflected by the 
great styles of the era and by the 

14
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:51,624
political and social revolutions,
Hindu architecture gateway to 

15
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:55,763
Phoenician,
Egyptian to Greek and Roman Esk to 

16
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:01,050
gothic locked into the walls of these 
temples,

17
00:01:01,051 --> 00:01:05,460
palaces and churches.
A civilization could launch what it knew

18
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:06,323
into the future,
confident that only the greatest 

19
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,730
upheavals and natural disasters might 
dislodge it from the earth,

20
00:01:11,731 --> 00:01:15,900
but as Notre Dame makes clear the gothic
period was the final page.

21
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:16,733
In this important epoch of architecture,
the advent of the printing press by 

22
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:24,450
Johannes Gutenberg changed everything in
printed books,

23
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:29,451
ideas found an even more durable capsule
for transmission into posterity,

24
00:01:29,521 --> 00:01:33,840
one that cost it far less to produce and
one that could be copied and sent across

25
00:01:33,841 --> 00:01:34,674
the world.
The rise of the printing press mirrors 

26
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:37,883
the decline of architecture as the 
dominant aesthetic for on Tumbler last 

27
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:42,803
week,
and this is what got me thinking about 

28
00:01:43,501 --> 00:01:44,334
this topic.
The Cajun Cavalier asked me what role I 

29
00:01:46,771 --> 00:01:47,604
thought architecture plays in society 
besides that of being a defense against 

30
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:52,493
the elements,
and it seems to me that these days 

31
00:01:54,001 --> 00:01:57,600
architecture is govern like most arts by
pluralism.

32
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:58,643
There is no consensus,
nor perhaps neither be as to a 

33
00:02:01,771 --> 00:02:02,604
representative style of the age arrows 
that came after the sunset of the 

34
00:02:06,151 --> 00:02:06,984
renaissance.
We're very reactionary to the revivals 

35
00:02:09,241 --> 00:02:10,074
of the past and sought to create a new 
aesthetic following from first the 

36
00:02:13,231 --> 00:02:14,064
functionalist objectivity of modernism,
and then the psychological subjectivity 

37
00:02:18,481 --> 00:02:19,314
of postmodernist after just major urban 
expansion that greatly emphasized the 

38
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,210
function of structures over aesthetic or
function as aesthetic.

39
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:31,650
Contemporary architectural concerns seem
largely to deal with our societies next,

40
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:32,484
great challenge,
sustainability or integration with the 

41
00:02:35,101 --> 00:02:35,934
environment,
and that's a concern that has to be met 

42
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,810
with action,
but it seems to me,

43
00:02:39,811 --> 00:02:40,644
and I may be wrong about this,
that there is a gross under emphasis of 

44
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:49,470
the power that architecture plays on our
consciousness and culture,

45
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:50,363
the demarcation of physical spaces,
the spatial arrangement of inside and 

46
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:55,770
outside.
What's communal,

47
00:02:55,771 --> 00:02:56,604
what's private in an urban environment 
have a massive effect on the way we see 

48
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:03,310
ourselves and our place in the society 
at large.

49
00:03:03,311 --> 00:03:06,580
What does it mean to live in a cramped 
studio apartment in Manhattan?

50
00:03:06,581 --> 00:03:07,414
What does it mean to live in suburbia 
among cookie cutter homes with perfect 

51
00:03:10,151 --> 00:03:13,450
lawns?
The utilitarian function of architecture

52
00:03:13,451 --> 00:03:14,284
is so obvious that it almost disappears 
into the background or rather it 

53
00:03:17,861 --> 00:03:20,780
disappears as the background and when we
let it do so,

54
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:23,500
when architecture becomes invisible to 
us,

55
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:28,060
it's influenced for good or bad,
becomes invisible as well.

56
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:31,720
In the inner city where I lived,
demand is so high for livable spaces.

57
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:36,160
New structures are built with such 
rapidity that it's impossible to imagine

58
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:39,730
any kind of central architectural theory
winning out.

59
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,640
That's pluralism at work tolerant but 
messy,

60
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,480
inclusive,
but alien.

61
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,830
The period after postmodernism has gone 
mostly undefined.

62
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:48,693
I don't know if a school of architecture
will ever again rise to cultural 

63
00:03:51,881 --> 00:03:52,714
predominance,
just like I don't know if we'll ever 

64
00:03:53,861 --> 00:03:54,694
have a classic literature with the same 
weight as Shakespeare or f Scott 

65
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,553
Fitzgerald,
but if there ever was a time Cajun 

66
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,380
cavalier for a new architecture,
a new idea,

67
00:04:05,381 --> 00:04:10,381
a new choreography of space and humanity
would be in the void of now.

68
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:17,250
Hey everybody.
Thanks for watching.

69
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:20,130
As you know,
a lot of time and research goes into the

70
00:04:20,131 --> 00:04:20,964
making of these videos,
so I want to thank the good 

71
00:04:22,321 --> 00:04:23,154
people@audible.com
for sponsoring this one and allowing me 

72
00:04:25,921 --> 00:04:29,310
to do all that research and spend all of
that time.

73
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,200
You haven't heard about it.
Audible.com

74
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,063

00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:37,800

77
00:04:37,801 --> 00:04:39,390

free audio.

80
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:49,530
That's a great opportunity to learn more
about architecture,

81
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,633
but in this case,
I'm going to recommend the hunchback of 

82
00:04:52,411 --> 00:04:54,740
Notre Dame by Victor Hugo.
Um,

83
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,110
it is an amazing book.
It's a classic and it's by the way,

84
00:04:58,111 --> 00:05:01,170
some way darker and better than the 
Disney version.

85
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,153
And also I,
I went to the site and check it's read 

86
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:07,350
by George Dahl,
who is one of the masters of audio books

87
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:09,990
and I might just listen to it again just
to hear him do it.

88
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,660
They have a free app so you can download
it and put it on your phone,

89
00:05:12,661 --> 00:05:13,494
which is what I usually do.
Listen to it on the subway or I'll 

90
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,790
listen to it like in my bed before I go 
to sleep.

91
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:22,650
For some reason that soothing to me.
I'm so go to audible.com/Evan.

92
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,513
Get the hunchback of Notre Dame on me.
I do want to mention that the idea for 

93
00:05:27,061 --> 00:05:30,120
this video came from the occasion 
cavalier on Tumbler.

94
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,083
Um,
last week I did a video on video games 

95
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,300
and all week long we were having 
conversations about it,

96
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,250
me and all the people who watch this 
video.

97
00:05:38,251 --> 00:05:39,084
So I want to thank all of you.
You've been commenting in the video 

98
00:05:40,801 --> 00:05:41,634
below.
You've been asking me anything on 

99
00:05:42,751 --> 00:05:45,900
tumbler where I can sort of expand on 
things a little bit more.

100
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:46,883
Um,
so keep doing that and I will see you 

101
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:48,923
next Friday.
