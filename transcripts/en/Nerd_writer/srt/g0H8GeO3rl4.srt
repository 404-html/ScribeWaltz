1
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,390
One of the great overlooked pop songs of
2016 was drake's feel,

2
00:00:09,391 --> 00:00:10,224
no ways of his April release views,
I think overlooked because in terms of 

3
00:00:13,351 --> 00:00:14,184
radio play,
I think the song was lost in the shadow 

4
00:00:15,871 --> 00:00:20,590
of one dance and controller to dancehall
and few singles that dominated the grip.

5
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,840
Sonia from way back when you know that I
don't play,

6
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,780
which is a shame because I feel no ways 
I think is just as good,

7
00:00:27,781 --> 00:00:30,450
if not better than those songs and more 
than that,

8
00:00:30,451 --> 00:00:31,284
it tells an interesting story about 
Drake's place at the center of Popular 

9
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:35,303
Music in 2016.
Now I want to spend most of my time 

10
00:00:37,021 --> 00:00:37,854
discussing the production here,
but lyrically we should note that feel 

11
00:00:40,411 --> 00:00:43,440
no ways treads over some familiar 
territory.

12
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:44,483
He's lamenting the end of a relationship
that he's had to cut short because it 

13
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:49,080
was holding him back.
Personally.

14
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:51,210
This is drake and full emotional pop.

15
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:55,950
Now some people come to drake for rap.
Others come to him for RNB inflicted pop

16
00:00:55,951 --> 00:00:56,784
like this,
but most of us love him and his music 

17
00:00:58,561 --> 00:01:01,260
for the bridge that he navigates.
Between those two things.

18
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:06,120
A bridge that was really first explored 
in a big way by Kanye west on his hugely

19
00:01:06,121 --> 00:01:06,954
influential album,
eight weeks in Hartland gene may cause 

20
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,073
within this 80 style electro r and b 
that young drake found a lane for 

21
00:01:19,921 --> 00:01:20,754
himself to dominate and perfect.
A drake himself cited Kanye as an 

22
00:01:24,121 --> 00:01:26,940
inspiration and drake's longtime 
producer and collaborator,

23
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,510
no afford 40 should be described as one 
of the early Eureka moment.

24
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,373
The experience of hearing drake rap over
Kanye say you will the first track from 

25
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:35,700
eight.
Wait,

26
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,700
why do I feel so alone?
Like everybody passes out the role.

27
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:43,493
I tried seven years later,
drake and 40 have shifted the pop focus 

28
00:01:47,221 --> 00:01:49,050
into their own center of gravity.

29
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:54,080
This Toronto Cold Edis Electro R and B 
rap pop hybrid that you hear everywhere,

30
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:58,650
most notably in the musician straight 
has signed his own record label.

31
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,513
October is very unsound or ops,
the producer from one of those 

32
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:03,223
extraordinary omen from Majid Jordan and
rnb duo composed feel no ways and it's 

33
00:02:07,701 --> 00:02:11,970
sort of the perfect distillation of the 
sounds and moods that we've been talking

34
00:02:11,971 --> 00:02:13,770
about.
Don't feel no ways is made up.

35
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,710
Essentially have three parts,
Greg's voice,

36
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,633
a break beat drum patterns and an 
electric piano that plays a simple but 

37
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,090
catchy chord progression that goes like 
this,

38
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:25,853
c major seven,
g major seven and a minor seven with a 

39
00:02:33,901 --> 00:02:34,734
few little flourishes here and there.
This progression pretty much loops for 

40
00:02:37,441 --> 00:02:38,274
the entire song,
but what's more significant than the 

41
00:02:40,441 --> 00:02:44,340
courts are the sounds that omen selected
for the song.

42
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:48,090
The synth being used here is the famous 
Yamaha dx seven,

43
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,200
which was only made between the years of
1983 and 1989.

44
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,423
The dx seven is one of the most 
commercially successful synthesizers of 

45
00:02:56,161 --> 00:02:56,994
all time.
It came equipped with 30 odd factory 

46
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,200
meant to emulate different instruments.
Now,

47
00:03:02,201 --> 00:03:03,034
in theory,
you could program more sounds in 

48
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:05,674
addition to this,
but the interface was so notoriously 

49
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:11,860
confusing that most people stuck to the 
presets and as a result,

50
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:12,723
a whole decade of music became infused 
and associated with these instantly 

51
00:03:16,721 --> 00:03:19,570
recognizable.
Sounds to the point of cliche

52
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:37,370
considering how tacky the dxf and 
sounded by the end of the eighties,

53
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,810
it's amazing how draken omen 
reappropriate it for this driving upbeat

54
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,280
pop song.
In 2016,

55
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:44,653
of course it wasn't sound as fresh by 
itself and that's why I think the true 

56
00:03:48,111 --> 00:03:51,200
cleverness here is how omen pairs this 
reality.

57
00:03:51,201 --> 00:03:52,034
DX seven,
emulation of a fender Rhodes piano with 

58
00:03:54,411 --> 00:03:55,244
another classic Edis Element,
a drum sample from the very origins of 

59
00:03:59,421 --> 00:04:00,254
hip hop.
This breakbeat comes from an absolutely 

60
00:04:05,131 --> 00:04:05,964
incredible album called scratch him,
which is an early hip hop record from 

61
00:04:09,241 --> 00:04:13,860
1983 put together by maybe the most 
unlikely guy.

62
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:14,723
Imagine that's Malcolm Mclaren,
a British impresario who helped launch 

63
00:04:19,501 --> 00:04:24,501
the punk movement in the UK by founding 
the sex pistols in 1975 in the eighties.

64
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:27,900
He went solo and released an album 
called duck rock under his own name,

65
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:30,570
which brought together African music and
American hip hop,

66
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:35,040
helping to popularize the sound and 
America and exported around the world on

67
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:35,874
duck rock and dlx scratching.
Mclaren collaborated with Djs from one 

68
00:04:38,701 --> 00:04:41,310
of the earliest and best hip hop radio 
shows.

69
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:45,300
The world's famous supreme team,
which aired at 4:00

70
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,133
AM on the east coast for an hour.
Omen brilliantly pulled the beat from 

71
00:04:49,351 --> 00:04:50,184
their song,
world's famous and put the DJ's own 

72
00:04:52,231 --> 00:04:53,790
voices and the breakdown

73
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:11,510
because way

74
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:18,050
two main elements pulls from both sides 
of drake's musical aesthetic,

75
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:18,923
eighties R and B and hip hop and fuses 
them under his voice which pops out of 

76
00:05:23,671 --> 00:05:24,504
the instrumentation like cold water.
I tried to sleep in the song is the 

77
00:05:33,391 --> 00:05:34,224
perfect encapsulation of the pop music 
that drake and his team have defined in 

78
00:05:37,411 --> 00:05:38,244
the last few years.
A kind of music that feeds its 

79
00:05:40,231 --> 00:05:43,080
influences within the elements that make
it up.

80
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:46,380
Of course eventually pop music,
we'll move on.

81
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,350
The style will change.
Someone new will move to the center,

82
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:53,710
but it's good to appreciate the moment 
we're in while we're in it,

83
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:58,400
especially in those rare times when the 
most popular

84
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,400
artist is also one of the best.
Hey everybody.

85
00:06:07,581 --> 00:06:11,090
Thanks for watching.
I'm so the nerdwriter crossed 900,000

86
00:06:11,091 --> 00:06:12,670
subscribers,
which um,

87
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,500
you know,
when I started this five years ago,

88
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:19,040
it never occurred to me that there would
be such an audience for the show.

89
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,310
And the more audience that comes on,
the more people that watch,

90
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:26,960
the more responsibility I feel to just 
keep making better and better and better

91
00:06:26,961 --> 00:06:29,510
content.
So thank you for watching.
