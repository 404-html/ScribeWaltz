00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,833
Hello,
all you vagrants and vagaries coffee on 

2
00:00:02,131 --> 00:00:07,131
a Tuesday and Vlog 57.
You know,

3
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:11,210
we have to put this Tuesday thing to bed
because you guys always comment,

4
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:13,550
but you don't release on a Tuesday.
What's the deal with that?

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:17,960
The truth is I don't film on a Tuesday.
I don't write on a Tuesday.

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,153
Sometimes I edit on Tuesday and I most 
usually don't release on a Tuesday 

7
00:00:22,281 --> 00:00:23,114
either.
It's just sort of become this running 

8
00:00:24,171 --> 00:00:25,370
joke.
I mean I sometimes think,

9
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:27,020
you know,
it's Tuesday somewhere,

10
00:00:27,021 --> 00:00:27,854
but then I realized that doesn't make 
any sense and then I think I just liked 

11
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:33,374
the way it sounds.

12
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:38,610
Okay.

13
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:42,860
Rem Koolhaas in his famous delirious New
York writes,

14
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:43,713
the metropolis strives to reach a 
mythical point where the world is 

15
00:00:46,431 --> 00:00:51,431
completely fabricated by man so that it 
absolutely coincides with his desires.

16
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:53,930
You're right,
it's true here.

17
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,793
All geometries are achingly formal,
even the parks and public gardens fits 

18
00:00:58,451 --> 00:01:02,420
snugly into the parallelograms that the 
streets and avenues draw.

19
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,920
Anything you want.
You can have.

20
00:01:03,921 --> 00:01:06,950
The metropolis is made for consumption,
leisure,

21
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:07,963
ease of travel.
It compliments and encourages that 

22
00:01:09,951 --> 00:01:14,030
profound pulp fiction novel truth,
which is that after 1920,

23
00:01:14,031 --> 00:01:17,560
the whole world became about Saturday 
night getting set

24
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:18,703
in this round.
Each player has only one minute to 

25
00:01:20,721 --> 00:01:21,554
retrieve a woman's phone number.
Let's see how our players perform at 

26
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:26,250
speed.
What of

27
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,750
the inevitability is about this city and
all cities,

28
00:01:28,751 --> 00:01:33,751
I suspect is that as you consume it,
it consumes you and it fills you up with

29
00:01:34,181 --> 00:01:36,790
its own self.
To the exclusion of all else,

30
00:01:36,791 --> 00:01:37,624
man hadn't is the perfect metaphor for 
itself because it's literally an island 

31
00:01:40,961 --> 00:01:44,770
and if it all of a sudden broke off and 
float it out into the Atlantic,

32
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,200
it's unclear how many of us would really
mine.

33
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:50,140
Of course we'd have to take Brooklyn in.
Tow.

34
00:01:50,141 --> 00:01:50,974
Cities are designed in a very insular 
way to obscure the world outside their 

35
00:01:54,401 --> 00:01:55,234
walls from the ground.
You can only see a few blocks in every 

36
00:01:57,341 --> 00:02:00,490
direction and the city just recedes into
more city.

37
00:02:00,491 --> 00:02:01,324
Its residence in this way worship the 
present moment in salvos of anxiety and 

38
00:02:06,101 --> 00:02:06,934
pleasure,
and in that worship and within these 

39
00:02:08,081 --> 00:02:11,350
geometric towers,
there is no anchor to the outside world.

40
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,213
No frame of reference in time spins out 
of control like how in the lack of 

41
00:02:16,301 --> 00:02:17,134
properly defined seasons,
Los Angeles skips from year to year 

42
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:23,350
without remark and in the absence of 
structure,

43
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:24,303
a relativism takes hold.
A feeling of an Omi sits heavily on the 

44
00:02:28,451 --> 00:02:29,284
salt and Omi,
the lack of social or ethical standards 

45
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:32,463
in an individual or group.
As God dies and the great cities are 

46
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:37,114
born and Omi is the keynote of the world
and we wait for the harvest of a 

47
00:02:41,231 --> 00:02:43,090
godless,
relativistic morality.

48
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:43,983
Last Friday was the full moon.
I came out of the subway and was 

49
00:02:47,051 --> 00:02:51,640
transfixed as transfixed as if I had 
seen an intruder in my home.

50
00:02:51,641 --> 00:02:52,474
It hung there brightly indifferently 
shining and observing the comings and 

51
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:57,124
goings of all the harried city dwellers 
as the culture around them decayed and 

52
00:03:01,031 --> 00:03:04,640
advanced at just the same right.
I was reminded of the night a stall,

53
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,210
foes brief sojourn to the moon in our 
stoves.

54
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:11,980
Famous Orlando Furioso were searching 
for a cure to Orlando's madness.

55
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:12,963
The night comes upon that valley where 
all last things on earth are found deep 

56
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:21,850
in a veil conducted by his guide where 
Rosa Mountain steep on either side.

57
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:26,940
He came and saw a wonder to relate 
whatever was wasted in our earthly state

58
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,160
here,
safely treasured each neglected,

59
00:03:30,161 --> 00:03:33,140
good time,
squandered or occasion it'll bestowed,

60
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,013
not only here our wealth inceptors found
that everchanging shift the unsteady 

61
00:03:38,681 --> 00:03:39,514
round,
but those possessions while on Earth we 

62
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:45,670
live which fortunes hand can neither 
take nor give much.

63
00:03:45,671 --> 00:03:50,500
Fame is there which here the creeping 
hours consume till time at length.

64
00:03:50,501 --> 00:03:54,880
The whole devours their vows and their 
unnumbered prayers remain,

65
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,550
which often God the center makes in 
vain.

66
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,350
The frequent tiers that lover's eyes 
suffuse the size they breed.

67
00:04:02,351 --> 00:04:03,184
The days that gamesters lose the leisure
given which fools so often neglect the 

68
00:04:07,841 --> 00:04:10,330
week designs that never take effect.

69
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:11,163
Whatever designs the mortal breasts,
a sale in countless numbers filled the 

70
00:04:15,131 --> 00:04:19,660
uncovered vale for whatever is lost by 
humankind.

71
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,960
Ascending here,
you treasured safe may find.

72
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:23,823
And then I wondered if a [inaudible] saw
the long lost tenants of common law or 

73
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,033
under some garland chance to find the 
sea cast fragments of unquiet mind 

74
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:34,323
discarded like flattery's proffer toward
that bone white kingdom without a lord 

75
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:39,874
as a fool to a stranger's care consigns 
his own children and foremost rhymes 

76
00:04:44,741 --> 00:04:45,574
would the night please with Orlando's 
vial on his chariot span the starlit 

77
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,183
aisle,
and bring to those who cast off and 

78
00:04:53,171 --> 00:04:56,710
forgot the essence of this urban 
thought.
