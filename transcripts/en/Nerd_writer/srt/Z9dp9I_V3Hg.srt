1
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:02,423
When it comes to retail shopping,
statistically there is no day more 

2
00:00:06,241 --> 00:00:10,080
harmful to your physical wellbeing than 
black Friday.

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:10,943
It's a day that can even be fatal.
In 2008 customers broke down the doors 

4
00:00:14,971 --> 00:00:15,804
at a Walmart in valley stream,
New York and an employee was killed in 

5
00:00:19,711 --> 00:00:21,480
the ensuing stampede.
Since then,

6
00:00:21,481 --> 00:00:25,950
the occupational safety and Health 
Administration or Osha has issued safety

7
00:00:25,951 --> 00:00:30,660
guidelines for stores wanting to avoid a
similar incident and why do people go so

8
00:00:30,661 --> 00:00:33,960
crazy on black Friday?
It's the deals of course,

9
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:34,823
the deals,
the opportunity to get a 32 inch plasma 

10
00:00:36,631 --> 00:00:37,464
TV for $179.
The chance to finish all your Christmas 

11
00:00:40,321 --> 00:00:41,154
shopping in one go.
The super big huge black promises of 

12
00:00:48,061 --> 00:00:52,380
such Gargantuan savings have 
traditionally made black Friday the most

13
00:00:52,381 --> 00:00:53,214
profitable shopping day of the year.
Indeed a number of businesses that 

14
00:00:56,281 --> 00:00:59,400
operate at a financial loss between 
January and November,

15
00:00:59,401 --> 00:01:00,234
one smart read in ledger books report 
sales during the holiday season that 

16
00:01:03,841 --> 00:01:06,210
make the entire year profitable.

17
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:08,790
Profits by the way,
are written in black ink,

18
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:11,040
hence black Friday.
I'm about but but,

19
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:11,874
but the only problem is both the name 
and the savings of black Friday aren't 

20
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,960
exactly what they see.
Let me explain.

21
00:01:18,961 --> 00:01:19,794
The first instances of the term black 
Friday actually have nothing to do with 

22
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:23,813
accounting jargon,
but with a newsletter from the 

23
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:27,720
Philadelphia police department in the 19
sixties.

24
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:32,370
Lamenting the huge crowds,
traffic jams in general chaos on the day

25
00:01:32,371 --> 00:01:33,204
after thanksgiving.
It was not a term of endearment for 

26
00:01:35,581 --> 00:01:36,414
Philly.
Cops knocked by a long shot despite 

27
00:01:37,891 --> 00:01:39,960
efforts to change the name to big 
Friday,

28
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:40,973
the term stuck so it was left to 
marketing executives to put a positive 

29
00:01:44,491 --> 00:01:45,324
spin on the whole thing and that's how 
you get the black ink thier and indeed 

30
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:49,734
like the name,
the promise savings of black Friday are 

31
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,240
largely an illusion as well and 
illusion,

32
00:01:54,241 --> 00:01:55,074
carefully designed for you the customer 
to act as irrationally and stupidly as 

33
00:02:00,331 --> 00:02:00,870
possible.

34
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,510
Big Box stores like Walmart and target 
and best buy.

35
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:06,120
Don't put everything out for sale on 
black Friday.

36
00:02:06,121 --> 00:02:06,954
Instead,
they put out select items as lost 

37
00:02:09,301 --> 00:02:10,134
leaders.
Product sold at or close to a loss for 

38
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:15,360
the company to get you in the door.
And amongst everything else,

39
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,750
they're still selling at a high margin.
You've got the TV,

40
00:02:18,751 --> 00:02:20,790
but now you need the normally priced 
wall mount,

41
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:24,240
the normally priced Hcmi cables and the 
normally priced Roku.

42
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,470
Actually,
when you look again,

43
00:02:25,471 --> 00:02:29,580
you see that the Roku though normally 
priced comes with a $40 rebate,

44
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,920
which you can get back in two months.
Not Bad,

45
00:02:31,921 --> 00:02:32,754
except for about 60 percent of rebates 
never get fulfilled because people just 

46
00:02:37,051 --> 00:02:37,884
forget or they fail to comply with all 
the print requirements they didn't read 

47
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:43,860
when rushing around,
best buy in a friends.

48
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:46,200
Indeed,
retailers know exactly what it's like to

49
00:02:46,201 --> 00:02:49,830
be in a hectic shopping environment and 
they exploited it to the extreme.

50
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:53,070
They know that rebates feel good,
but people forget.

51
00:02:53,071 --> 00:02:56,190
They know that warranty is may seem like
peace of mind and the checkout lane,

52
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:01,420
but actually fuel a 15 billion industry 
of pure profit,

53
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,240
pure profit.
It feels so good.

54
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,103
They know that we shopped by means of 
rationalization and justification that 

55
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:08,854
by putting a super expensive item next 
to a normally price one will increase 

56
00:03:12,251 --> 00:03:15,130
the sales of the latter because we don't
see price,

57
00:03:15,131 --> 00:03:15,964
we see price different.
They know everything that this article 

58
00:03:18,341 --> 00:03:19,174
by economic researchers proved with the 
help of Mri scans that we are not 

59
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:23,463
rational actors when we shop,
but that the image of a deal lights up 

60
00:03:26,501 --> 00:03:27,334
our brain with pleasure like a Christmas
tree and that we choose between that 

61
00:03:31,091 --> 00:03:34,600
pleasure and the pain of spending when 
deciding on a purchase.

62
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:39,040
Retailers do everything they can to 
remove the immediate pain of spending,

63
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:41,050
hence rebates in store,
credit cards,

64
00:03:41,051 --> 00:03:44,650
installment plans and the like,
but it's these things often riddled with

65
00:03:44,651 --> 00:03:45,484
hidden fees and Hula hoops that ended up
killing and eclipsing the savings you 

66
00:03:49,211 --> 00:03:50,860
thought you were getting in the first 
place.

67
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:52,840
As Derek Thompson writes in the 
Atlantic,

68
00:03:52,841 --> 00:03:53,674
the first and last rule of prices is 
that nobody knows what anything is 

69
00:03:57,071 --> 00:04:00,130
really worth.
Shoppers are guided by shallow clues.

70
00:04:00,131 --> 00:04:01,930
This is cheaper than that and latent 
emotions.

71
00:04:01,931 --> 00:04:05,770
It just feels like a good deal rather 
than knowledge and deliberate thinking,

72
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,633
but this isn't just the case for black 
Friday and increasingly anachronistic 

73
00:04:09,431 --> 00:04:10,264
term.
In a world of Cyber Mondays and 

74
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:16,440
Thursdays where Santa is an employee of 
Ford and Chevy and Mercedes-benz.

75
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:17,643
It's true the whole year round,
perhaps in this case the black ink 

76
00:04:20,201 --> 00:04:21,034
theory is worth keeping in mind.
It's the retailers that go into the 

77
00:04:24,101 --> 00:04:24,934
black on black Friday,
not the customers think of it that way 

78
00:04:28,151 --> 00:04:33,151
and it's easier to see that despite 
every single ad saying otherwise the day

79
00:04:33,701 --> 00:04:37,090
was never really about you.
It's about them

80
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,333
black.

81
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:44,663
Hey everybody.
Thanks for watching and happy 

82
00:04:45,781 --> 00:04:48,090
thanksgiving.
There is so much more to say about black

83
00:04:48,091 --> 00:04:48,924
Friday,
particularly how it relates to economic 

84
00:04:50,521 --> 00:04:52,380
inequality in our country.
I didn't get into that,

85
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,393
but if you want to read more about it,
you can find that in the description 

86
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:57,150
this thanksgiving.
I am grateful to you,

87
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,133
all of you.
Thank you so much for watching and 

88
00:04:59,131 --> 00:05:03,180
engaging all the comments on last week's
video about sexism or amazing,

89
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:04,043
incredibly thought out and I'm so glad I
got to have the conversation with you 

90
00:05:06,991 --> 00:05:09,390
and comments.
That's where it's always happening.

91
00:05:09,391 --> 00:05:12,750
So I'm in comments and you can comment 
and I will respond to you.

92
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:16,140
Make sure to follow me on twitter if you
haven't already.

93
00:05:16,141 --> 00:05:16,974
A lot of you guys did last week.
Thank you for that and I will see you 

94
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:24,290
next time.
That's my commercial voice.

95
00:05:28,051 --> 00:05:30,900
You can find my resume for voiceover 
work in the description.

96
00:05:30,901 --> 00:05:31,950
I have no resume.
