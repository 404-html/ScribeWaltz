1
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:23,213
Generally,
it's the attitude with which humor is 

2
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:33,430
towed,
which I enjoy

3
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:56,450
that little bit of slapstick comedy by 
the Great Rowan Atkinson is as simple as

4
00:00:56,451 --> 00:00:59,420
it gets.
Unsuspecting man walks into a tree.

5
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:00,853
It's probably the most famous bit from 
the late 1970 [inaudible] sketch show 

6
00:01:03,051 --> 00:01:05,450
that Atkinson starting called not the 
9:00

7
00:01:05,451 --> 00:01:09,470
news and what elevates it beyond a 
simple joke is the same thing that makes

8
00:01:09,471 --> 00:01:13,970
Atkinson one of the world's most gifted 
physical comedians attitude.

9
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:17,240
I mean,
look at this sweet little man noticing a

10
00:01:17,241 --> 00:01:21,980
camera being self conscious at first,
but just at the moment he starts to feel

11
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:24,440
a little bit special.
He's undercut.

12
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:29,150
Atkinson has the chops of the very best 
physical comedians like Charlie Chaplin,

13
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,100
Buster Keaton or shock dot,
but what sets them apart I think is this

14
00:01:34,101 --> 00:01:38,270
natural gift for characterization.
Nonverbal characterization,

15
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:41,270
not just the ability to do funny things 
physically,

16
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:45,380
but the ability to use that physicality 
to broadcast and attitude.

17
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,290
The things that make me laugh on 
characters,

18
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,133
you know,
it's people who kind of present a sort 

19
00:01:50,241 --> 00:01:51,200
of truth to.

20
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,103
I mean,
even though it's mad or it's funny or 

21
00:01:53,091 --> 00:01:55,760
it's wacky or it's rude or it's or it's 
silly,

22
00:01:55,761 --> 00:01:58,880
but there's a sort of a truth there that
you identify with.

23
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:01,910
Of course,
most people know Atkinson as Mr Bean,

24
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:06,080
the globally famous character he created
who's mostly wordless antics,

25
00:02:06,081 --> 00:02:08,660
call back to the visual comedy of silent
films.

26
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,650
Most Americans probably know him from 
the being feature films that came later,

27
00:02:12,651 --> 00:02:13,484
but the original Sitcom which ran for 
only 15 episodes across six years is 

28
00:02:17,811 --> 00:02:18,644
where the best being work is.
That's generally because the more 

29
00:02:21,861 --> 00:02:24,320
cinematic the format,
the less interesting Mr.

30
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:27,590
Bean becomes.
Atkinson doesn't need much more than the

31
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:30,980
single two shot to work wonders.
Unlike Chaplin Keaton,

32
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:34,580
Atkinson isn't a director.
He's a performer through

33
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:39,200
this is hell no,
I am the devil.

34
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,023
Good evening,
but you couldn't call me toby if you 

35
00:02:44,481 --> 00:02:49,070
like.
We tried to keep things informal here as

36
00:02:49,071 --> 00:02:54,071
well as infertile.
That's just a little joke is why

37
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:01,750
I think Atkinson's purist and often work
is in his stage shows no frills,

38
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:02,974
just a man and his audience.
These shows make the most of Atkinson's 

39
00:03:05,711 --> 00:03:07,630
talents.
The skits are funny,

40
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:10,950
but the attitude in which they're 
performed is the

41
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,280
Jordan tried to keep things in full here
as well as in fertile.

42
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:23,700
That's just a little joke on,
on names,

43
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:30,710
anus.
Awesome.

44
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:41,650
I'm a dick.
I'm a dick.

45
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:45,763
You know,
a lot of prospective brides asked me 

46
00:03:48,381 --> 00:03:50,570
these days,
father,

47
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:54,410
what is the church's attitude to 
fellatio?

48
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,373
And I tend to reply by telling them a 
little story about the first time I was 

49
00:04:07,281 --> 00:04:08,114
asked that question.
All jokes that require the performer to 

50
00:04:14,631 --> 00:04:16,580
strike the exact right tone

51
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,860
because it's the character that makes 
them work,

52
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:19,793
not the punchlines.
It's the way this freeze cracks the 

53
00:04:21,811 --> 00:04:24,270
communion wafer and dips it into the 
wine.

54
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:25,283
It's the dead pan seriousness of this 
school master doing a totally absurd 

55
00:04:28,921 --> 00:04:31,680
roll call.
It's the way the devil drops his head to

56
00:04:31,681 --> 00:04:36,681
the side with a bit of self deprecation.
The character is the joke.

57
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:50,770
This is the comedy personality.
It's not about doing funny things.

58
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:57,620
It's about doing something quite normal 
in a funny way

59
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:02,480
that's actually Atkinson himself acting 
in narrating a documentary,

60
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:06,350
really along video essay on the 
principles of visual comedy.

61
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,513
I'll link to it below.
Definitely watched the whole thing in 

62
00:05:09,441 --> 00:05:10,274
describing the comedy of personality.
Atkinson is describing what excites him 

63
00:05:13,701 --> 00:05:15,710
the most,
but also what he's the best app.

64
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,873
For example,
if you were to take the comedy of 

65
00:05:17,781 --> 00:05:18,614
personality to its most extreme,
he probably get a sketch like this one 

66
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,413
where Atkinson gives an acting lecture,
portraying a bunch of different 

67
00:05:26,361 --> 00:05:27,194
personalities,

68
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,550
Imessenger and just bearing good news

69
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:39,470
I mentioned to inches

70
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:41,460
bad news

71
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,230
messenger

72
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:51,410
and just burying bad news,
which he thinks is good news.

73
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,343
There's really no joke at all here.
Just personalities and personalities 

74
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,113
within personalities.
Atkinson is playing his self serious 

75
00:06:06,311 --> 00:06:07,144
actor playing various different parts.
The actor is proudly displaying his 

76
00:06:10,631 --> 00:06:12,280
talent,
but when something goes wrong,

77
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:13,480
we get a glimpse of

78
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,513
character underneath and it's even funny
to really grasp and audience with 

79
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:19,050
comedy.

80
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:19,883
This takes enormous precision and those 
who can do it have a style that is 

81
00:06:23,281 --> 00:06:24,114
completely inimitable,
which is sort of ironic since being a 

82
00:06:26,671 --> 00:06:27,504
physical comedian requires a mastery of 
invitation and a minute study of human 

83
00:06:31,831 --> 00:06:32,664
behavior.
These comedians find comedy in the 

84
00:06:34,471 --> 00:06:35,304
slightest things,
the way someone flicks a wrist or the 

85
00:06:38,461 --> 00:06:39,294
way someone pronounces the first letter 
in a word and he knew we're feels a 

86
00:06:46,861 --> 00:06:51,470
single piano note.
We're signifies a whole nationality with

87
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,313
the tiniest

88
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:53,483
as well as the Russians.
Generally the things that make me laugh 

89
00:07:02,751 --> 00:07:03,830
or characters,
you know,

90
00:07:03,831 --> 00:07:07,430
it's people who kind of present a sort 
of truth to you.

91
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:10,910
I mean even though it's mad or it's 
funny or it's wacky or it's rude or it's

92
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:13,970
though it's silly,
but there's a sort of a truth there that

93
00:07:13,971 --> 00:07:18,950
you identify with and you think that 
situation I've been there,

94
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:19,823
I've seen someone like that on the train
or I am someone like that and I prefer 

95
00:07:25,281 --> 00:07:27,260
to keep it hidden.
And yet here,

96
00:07:27,261 --> 00:07:32,261
here I am being characterized extremely 
well and that's

97
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,033
one of the questions you guys asked me 
all the time is what kind of software I 

98
00:07:58,651 --> 00:07:59,484
use to make these videos will to edit.
I use final cut pro 10 and since 10 is 

99
00:08:03,811 --> 00:08:06,210
so different from the program that came 
before it.

100
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:10,110
I depended a lot on online videos to 
teach me all the new features.

101
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,213
These days you can pretty much teach 
yourself anything this way and
