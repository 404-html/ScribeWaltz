1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,430
Whenever I want to learn how a movie is 
put together,

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:04,293
one of the first things I do is get a 
pen and paper and just count the shots 

3
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:09,663
seriously.
It's not very technical and it's a bit 

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,300
tedious,
but just tallying.

5
00:00:13,301 --> 00:00:16,840
Every time there's a cut forces you to 
see things in a different way.

6
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:17,733
It kills the illusion just enough that 
the nuts and bolts start to come into 

7
00:00:21,611 --> 00:00:22,750
view.
For example,

8
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:27,220
let's take a look at pt Anderson's.
There will be blood already by the third

9
00:00:27,221 --> 00:00:28,054
shot.
I noticed a camera technique that would 

10
00:00:29,531 --> 00:00:31,600
be used again and again throughout the 
film.

11
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:35,980
This heavy emphasis on double and triple
framing in single shots.

12
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,810
Anderson and cinematographer Robert 
Elswit.

13
00:00:37,811 --> 00:00:41,620
We're clearly interested in making a 
movie comprised largely of long takes,

14
00:00:41,621 --> 00:00:42,454
but they keep up the momentum by 
collapsing multiple shots into one 

15
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:47,620
thing's never dragged on or get too 
boring,

16
00:00:47,621 --> 00:00:51,250
which is definitely a consideration when
your movie is two and a half hours long.

17
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,113
In fact,
by the end of the 14 and a half minute 

18
00:00:53,231 --> 00:00:54,700
dialogue,
free introduction,

19
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:59,760
I was struck by the length of the shots 
and by how few there actually were 73 to

20
00:00:59,831 --> 00:01:00,664
be exact and 14 and a half minutes 
divided by 73 means that each shot on 

21
00:01:04,721 --> 00:01:09,250
average was about 12 seconds long.
That's a really long average shot length

22
00:01:09,251 --> 00:01:10,084
by today's standard and something I 
wasn't expecting Anderson to keep up 

23
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:14,530
throughout the rest of the film.
This graph,

24
00:01:14,531 --> 00:01:15,364
by the way,
showing that average shotlink have 

25
00:01:16,661 --> 00:01:19,810
decreased over the years,
comes from the work of Barry Salt,

26
00:01:19,811 --> 00:01:22,990
who's been writing about film metrics 
since the sixties and seventies,

27
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:25,120
and if you want to dive deeper into 
metrics like these,

28
00:01:25,121 --> 00:01:29,110
I highly recommend visiting his websites
in the metrics were all kinds of data is

29
00:01:29,111 --> 00:01:31,750
listed out for literally thousands of 
movies,

30
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:35,500
but I think the best insights come from 
doing the counting yourself.

31
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:36,363
For example,
one of the things that occurs to you 

32
00:01:37,361 --> 00:01:38,194
watching there will be blood like this,
is that the value of a simple cut 

33
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:44,050
increases as the number of cuts 
decreases.

34
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:45,213
It's amazing how impactful a cut can be 
when you're not watching them happened 

35
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,430
at breakneck speed.
I don't mean to say that films with more

36
00:01:51,431 --> 00:01:52,264
cuts are necessarily worse or better.
Just that a movie like there will be 

37
00:01:55,901 --> 00:01:59,200
blood finds a lot of power in a common 
cinematic device.

38
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:01,240
The moment you make a decision,
it's,

39
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:04,900
it's very,
it's in stark relief to the audience and

40
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:05,853
there's.
There's a lot of a big spotlight on now 

41
00:02:10,391 --> 00:02:11,224
I'm changing perspective.
Now I'm telling you something else with 

42
00:02:13,151 --> 00:02:13,984
so few cuts his ticket,
nor says the contrast of each is dialed 

43
00:02:16,451 --> 00:02:18,820
up considerably and like Daniel 
plainview,

44
00:02:18,821 --> 00:02:21,850
Anderson and ticket or mine,
that contrast for meaning.

45
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:23,043
A lot of times it's literal cutting 
between dark frames and right frames or 

46
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:27,790
loud moments and quiet one.

47
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,990
Just a quick side note.
This sequence right here,

48
00:02:34,991 --> 00:02:36,100
by the way,
shots to 50,

49
00:02:36,101 --> 00:02:36,934
62,
63 are the quickest cutting in the film 

50
00:02:38,651 --> 00:02:39,484
by Far Anderson,
you so few shots that Dick nor had to 

51
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:46,270
find ways to artificially add more cuts 
to build up the momentum of this moment.

52
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:47,343
You can actually see that shots to 58 to
60 are just alternate angles of the 

53
00:02:50,711 --> 00:02:54,040
shots that came before them.
It's really good editing anyway.

54
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:54,933
Other times the contrast is personal.
If you want it to suggest that two 

55
00:02:57,431 --> 00:02:59,800
characters were different sides.
The same coin,

56
00:02:59,801 --> 00:03:00,940
for example,
archrivals,

57
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,960
but cut from the same cloth.
All you need is two shots,

58
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:08,050
one tracking into a character,
mumbling to himself,

59
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:11,200
bathed in light,
another tracking out from a character,

60
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,540
mumbling to himself,
covered in shadow.

61
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:14,613
What I realized after a while is that 
there's a domino effect longer takes me 

62
00:03:17,591 --> 00:03:20,650
more impactful cuts mean more attention 
to composition,

63
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,630
and if you want your framing to mean 
something,

64
00:03:22,631 --> 00:03:23,464
then your cuts up to mean something 
because the cut is where the viewer 

65
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:29,230
really sees the framing and they see it 
with a fresh memory,

66
00:03:29,231 --> 00:03:32,230
almost an after image of the frame that 
came before.

67
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,093
Sometimes it is actually a memory,
and if you want your cuts to mean 

68
00:03:36,191 --> 00:03:37,024
something,
then you have to use them sparingly and 

69
00:03:38,741 --> 00:03:39,574
with care.
Every single shot is filled with a kind 

70
00:03:41,771 --> 00:03:45,430
of anticipation because these cuts are 
registered consciously.

71
00:03:45,431 --> 00:03:46,264
On the viewer's mind,
we're all waiting for the next one to 

72
00:03:48,221 --> 00:03:49,450
come and everything around you.

73
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:52,913
Sure.

74
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:56,423
Yes,
and knows that anticipation is just a 

75
00:03:57,781 --> 00:03:58,614
form of focus and he's great at 
channeling that heightened focus toward 

76
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:05,640
the performances and when you have an 
actor as magnetic as Daniel Day Lewis,

77
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:06,503
the longer the take,
the more you hang on his every word and 

78
00:04:09,481 --> 00:04:14,481
pause.
I see the worst in people.

79
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:20,650
I don't need to look past seeing them to
get online.

80
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,753
Watching this movie,
I noticed that conversations like this 

81
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,940
or the place with the most frequent 
editing on average and necessity of shot

82
00:04:28,941 --> 00:04:30,590
reverse shot,
but even here,

83
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:32,810
everything is deliberate.
This sequence,

84
00:04:32,811 --> 00:04:35,690
for example,
is 16 shots in three and a half minutes.

85
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:36,773
Take an hour.
Holds firm on the wide until Eli makes 

86
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:41,580
the key comment.
What is it that brought you here,

87
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:44,870
sir?
Good Lord's guidance.

88
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:47,810
Of course,
developing news.

89
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,700
He cuts in,
but only a little while.

90
00:04:49,701 --> 00:04:51,710
Daniel thinks he's still dealing with 
the father.

91
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:54,310
Then when it's clear,
eli is the prime negotiator.

92
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:58,160
The scene locks on closeups as they 
battled back and forth,

93
00:04:58,450 --> 00:04:59,390
though,
I don't know for sure.

94
00:04:59,391 --> 00:05:00,224
It looks a lot like ticking or extended 
the silences here to augment the 

95
00:05:02,961 --> 00:05:03,794
intensity.

96
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,710
That's good.
It works.

97
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,633
Giving the shots,
breathing room on both sides of the 

98
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:12,910
dialogue,
far from making the scene drag,

99
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:13,773
dials up the emotion considerably,
and this is something Henderson does 

100
00:05:16,121 --> 00:05:16,954
throughout the film.
Closeups are used again and again from 

101
00:05:19,051 --> 00:05:19,884
moments of silence,
just as much for important pieces of 

102
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,290
dialogue.
Pt Anderson,

103
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:24,124
like the Coen brothers is great at 
casting for faces and he wants us to 

104
00:05:27,341 --> 00:05:28,174
watch them as much as listen,
and of course he wants us to watch 

105
00:05:31,271 --> 00:05:32,104
Daniel plainview the most who corrodes 
with bitterness across a series of 

106
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,430
closeups even as he finds success in the
solitude that he craves.

107
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:40,330
I drink

108
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:45,330
water.
I drink it every day.

109
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,840
I drink the blood of flack from bandage 
cracked.

110
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:54,310
There are 678 shots in there will be 
blood over two and a half hours.

111
00:05:54,311 --> 00:05:58,340
That means that each shot is 13 point 
three seconds on average,

112
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,473
more than the introduction.
The movie is remarkably consistent on 

113
00:06:01,941 --> 00:06:02,774
this front.
Each hour or half hour taken alone will 

114
00:06:04,881 --> 00:06:07,520
average somewhere around 12 to 14 
seconds.

115
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,650
Maybe this is what gives the movie,
it's steady,

116
00:06:09,651 --> 00:06:10,484
but unrelenting pace,
the feeling that you're watching a 

117
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,000
train,
you can't stop.

118
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,460
There are tons of ways to deconstruct a 
movie,

119
00:06:16,461 --> 00:06:17,294
but it's amazing what you can learn just
from looking at the shots one by one as 

120
00:06:20,931 --> 00:06:22,580
they go by.
For many of us,

121
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:27,290
loving a film means wanting to know how 
it works with the spirit of an engineer.

122
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:28,790
We take it apart,
twist it,

123
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:29,840
turn it,
bend it,

124
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,600
and put it back together.
Or at least we try to.

125
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:35,630
A great movie will never give up all at 
secrets,

126
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,830
but it will give up.

127
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,753
Some of this episode is brought to you 
by the great courses plus the great 

128
00:06:43,371 --> 00:06:45,740
courses plus is an on demand video 
learning service,

129
00:06:45,741 --> 00:06:48,210
which basically means it's got around 
7,000

130
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:49,123
online video lecture series from some 
great professors about all kinds of 

131
00:06:52,611 --> 00:06:53,740
subjects.
Math,

132
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:54,620
history,
archeology,

133
00:06:54,621 --> 00:06:55,490
art,
you name it.

134
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:56,683
One that I think you should really check
out is called the inexplicable universe 

135
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:02,510
unsolved mysteries by Neil de Grasse 
Tyson,

136
00:07:02,511 --> 00:07:05,960
which is super heady and interesting,
and it's taught by Neil Tyson,

137
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:06,853
which is all you should need to know.
