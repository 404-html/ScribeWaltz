1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:03,290
Coffee on the Tuesday and blog eight.

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,100
Right.

3
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,620
So Halloween was yesterday and the 
weekend was a whole lot of fun.

4
00:00:16,621 --> 00:00:18,060
My friends had a lot of cool costumes to
it.

5
00:00:18,061 --> 00:00:18,950
I love that.
You know,

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:19,793
I have friends who put a lot of work 
into it because just makes the holiday 

7
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,063
fucking awesome.
I'm actually going to put these down 

8
00:00:23,821 --> 00:00:26,130
because it's a little bit dangerous to 
have adamantium near a computer screen.

9
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,140
So before we get to the main event,
this luggage,

10
00:00:28,141 --> 00:00:30,630
when I mentioned for a moment what I did
last night for actual Halloween,

11
00:00:30,631 --> 00:00:33,000
I actually got the chance to see one of 
my heroes last night in concert,

12
00:00:33,001 --> 00:00:35,160
the author Neil Gaiman at the theater 
on.

13
00:00:35,161 --> 00:00:36,540
We'll show you haven't read anything by 
Neil Gaiman.

14
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,393
Start doing that right now and if you 
ever get the chance to hear him read 

15
00:00:39,601 --> 00:00:42,540
live in concert,
just buy the ticket.

16
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:44,250
Don't even think about it.
Performed with his wife,

17
00:00:44,251 --> 00:00:47,760
Amanda Palmer of the Dresden dolls.
I never was too much interim music,

18
00:00:47,761 --> 00:00:51,720
but to hear her live a was breathtaking.
After the show,

19
00:00:51,721 --> 00:00:52,554
they came up to sign autographs and by 
some weird turn of luck they just 

20
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,150
started the line right where we were 
standing,

21
00:00:57,151 --> 00:00:57,984
so I got a chance to shake meals hand 
and just extend my thanks for 

22
00:01:00,751 --> 00:01:01,501
everything.
Unfortunately,

23
00:01:01,501 --> 00:01:03,630
I don't have any video that.
Oh wait a second.

24
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:05,680
Ah,

25
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:09,250
proof just goes to show how many times I
wear a pair of jeans.

26
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:10,143
Okay.
Let's get to the main event of this 

27
00:01:10,871 --> 00:01:11,704
blog,
which my friends do a web series and 

28
00:01:12,341 --> 00:01:15,300
sketch comedy shorts called the Burns 
Worth Saturdays,

29
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,320
so in honor of Halloween they did a 
short film called Pten.

30
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:18,183
Larry go to the haunted hotel and rented
out a room at the beautiful Langham 

31
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,980
Hotel in Pasadena and film there for 
about 12 hours.

32
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:24,973
About a week ago was primarily my 
friends Steven's project and I helped 

33
00:01:26,831 --> 00:01:27,664
out as much as I could do.
I wanted to film some behind the scenes 

34
00:01:30,161 --> 00:01:30,994
footage that I could put it on this blog
and show you what it's like to make a 

35
00:01:33,821 --> 00:01:36,160
film over a full day.
Without any further ado,

36
00:01:36,161 --> 00:01:36,994
here it is.
The making of Pete and Larry at the 

37
00:01:39,581 --> 00:01:40,940
haunted hotel.
What are we do?

38
00:01:40,941 --> 00:01:41,774
What are you doing?

39
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:44,450
I want it to be static.
I mean,

40
00:01:44,451 --> 00:01:48,460
what are you doing right now?
Nothing.

41
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:52,460
Get that fucking cocaine that you guys 
should both freeze frame,

42
00:01:52,461 --> 00:01:55,190
like not an actual person,
but you guys are just not moving and I'm

43
00:01:55,191 --> 00:01:55,900
going to stop.
So yeah,

44
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,060
like I kind of punch you out.
I finish up my pine tonight.

45
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:00,080
I'm just standing there like this and 
see if it goes.

46
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:05,170
Oh hell Larry.
Alright.

47
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:11,330
We'll see what they have on the door.
Bit looked so sloppy.

48
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:14,720
I really think that if it's.
If we look at the same time,

49
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:19,960
that's the only way it's gonna work.
What seems to be a serious problem?

50
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:28,060
You got a major problem was that it's 
filthy in here.

51
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:29,823
My brother is having a conference,
the keynote speaker at the [inaudible] 

52
00:02:33,221 --> 00:02:38,221
conference,
so I suggested come in,

53
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:46,320
come in to me like we're hugging.
They put it in the eight.

54
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,480
So where are we in the filming of the 
movie yet?

55
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:56,890
The second set of day I watched,
I watched the dark night again,

56
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:01,780
thinking you guys are insane because 
it's just on a whole nother level.

57
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:06,430
Even with Heath Ledger,
it's just a whole nother level of moving

58
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,580
from that navigant.

59
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,413
You're saying that you think we're 
insane thing that that begins is better 

60
00:03:10,281 --> 00:03:11,390
than dark night?
Absolutely.

61
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:15,290
When the truth is found to be lies.

62
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:31,760
Wow.
That's all I got for that.

63
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:02,570
Woo Woo.
Oh,

64
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:17,280
cool.
Good shots.

65
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,513
It's just one single family.
There's a lot more than covering that's 

66
00:04:25,831 --> 00:04:28,480
happening in the shots that the problem 
is.

67
00:04:28,481 --> 00:04:30,760
This whole scene just keeps going.
Action.

68
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
No one look at me.
Oh,

69
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:54,250
from what?
No,

70
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:11,460
somebody else.
Yeah,

71
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:19,730
it's too bad.
Well,

72
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:27,480
that's something where it's needed.
God.

73
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:37,020
Larry King of haunted hotel,
which is what we're filming right now.

74
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:39,200
Indeed.
Our.

75
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:43,270
And you just turn your head gear head on
top of mind.

76
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,013
Yeah,
that's fine.

77
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,290
Yeah.
Yeah.

78
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,710
That sounds fair enough.
Yet what's wrong?

79
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,700
So there you go.
That's about 12 hours of film,

80
00:05:56,701 --> 00:05:57,990
a condensed into four minutes.
Check

81
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:01,190
for the link of that short film and the 
rest of the Saturdays in the dubliner.

82
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,033
I also want to say that I'm really proud
of my friend Steven and all my friends 

83
00:06:04,521 --> 00:06:05,790
were continuing to make things.
You know,

84
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,673
they want to do it for a living,
but I think it's important that 

85
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,450
everybody does that.
Everybody makes things,

86
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:12,300
whether it be a comedy short,
a dramatic show,

87
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,250
a painting,
a book,

88
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,010
a song,
Nsx sculpture or dance,

89
00:06:15,011 --> 00:06:17,080
a show what as important that no matter 
who you are,

90
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:17,943
no matter what you do for a living,
that you take some time to make 

91
00:06:20,061 --> 00:06:22,700
something that has no other purpose 
besides itself.

92
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:23,563
It's important to tell about our souls 
so that when people watch the things we 

93
00:06:25,701 --> 00:06:28,520
make or read the things we make or 
listen to,

94
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:31,220
the things we make,
they can know who we are.
