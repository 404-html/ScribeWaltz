1
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,880
Coffee on a Tuesday,
Flanagan second.

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:05,240
What are you doing?
Uh,

3
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:06,380
I thought I could just do

4
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:20,870
so.
Maybe you've had this experience before.

5
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:21,733
You were dreaming something terrible 
like you were a little child and your 

6
00:00:23,631 --> 00:00:26,960
mother was yelling at you or a giant 
evil baby was chasing you or you saw the

7
00:00:26,961 --> 00:00:28,550
death of your wife.
Whatever it is,

8
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,190
you wake up feeling like shit.
You say to yourself,

9
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:34,040
this is going to be a shitty day.
I just have a feeling.

10
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:34,903
Then getting out of the shower,
you slip and fall and layer you trip on 

11
00:00:36,951 --> 00:00:40,910
the sidewalk and spill your coffee 
everywhere and then you do it again.

12
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,700
Your friend calls you and says she can't
make it for lunch.

13
00:00:43,701 --> 00:00:44,534
Your job application comes back,
rejected you burn your hand on the 

14
00:00:46,521 --> 00:00:48,290
stove.
There was no toilet paper.

15
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:51,320
Desperate housewives is a repeat and you
go to bed thinking,

16
00:00:51,321 --> 00:00:54,320
what a shitty day.
I knew it was gonna be shit.

17
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:56,390
Now.
I think we can see right here that there

18
00:00:56,391 --> 00:00:57,224
was nothing in the physical universe,
which is guaranteeing a bad day for our 

19
00:00:59,901 --> 00:01:00,530
friend Justin.

20
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:01,363
No,
the universe doesn't care what kind of 

21
00:01:02,121 --> 00:01:02,954
data is.
It's just another rotation of 360 

22
00:01:04,341 --> 00:01:05,174
degrees,
but it's here that Justin decides and 

23
00:01:06,201 --> 00:01:07,034
all his infinite wisdom that he's going 
to make a prediction about the day to 

24
00:01:09,921 --> 00:01:14,120
day is going to be bad and all that bad 
stuff really does happen,

25
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,073
so going to bed,
Justin believes that his prediction was 

26
00:01:17,421 --> 00:01:18,254
dead on.
This is called a self fulfilling 

27
00:01:19,311 --> 00:01:21,590
prophecy,
a false definition of the situation,

28
00:01:21,591 --> 00:01:22,424
evoking new behavior which makes the 
originally false definition come 

29
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:28,500
consciously or unconsciously.
Justin created his own bad day,

30
00:01:28,501 --> 00:01:29,334
but he's no different than any of us.
Self fulfilling prophecies are 

31
00:01:30,681 --> 00:01:31,514
inexorably weaved into all of our lives 
and we go through life thinking that 

32
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,530
this is going to be a bad day or I'm 
definitely going to get this job or that

33
00:01:36,531 --> 00:01:39,050
student's going to do really well,
or these banks are in trouble,

34
00:01:39,051 --> 00:01:40,940
so I withdraw my money just to be safe.

35
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:41,803
In every example,
false definitions lead to real outcomes 

36
00:01:43,641 --> 00:01:44,474
like a bad day or a good job or a 
straight a student or a global 

37
00:01:48,381 --> 00:01:49,940
recession,
and the concept is old.

38
00:01:49,941 --> 00:01:51,680
See oedipus Macbeth,
Star Wars,

39
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:54,830
but the idea of self fulfilling prophecy
has much deeper connotations.

40
00:01:54,831 --> 00:01:55,664
Then Justin's bad day.
Each and every one of our identities 

41
00:01:58,191 --> 00:02:01,280
comes into existence by way of them as 
cute little infants.

42
00:02:01,281 --> 00:02:03,590
We are psychologically no different from
animals.

43
00:02:03,591 --> 00:02:06,580
We react to the stimuli around us based 
on genetic program.

44
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:09,470
We have no sense of meaning,
no sense of ourselves,

45
00:02:09,471 --> 00:02:10,640
no identity,
but as babies.

46
00:02:10,641 --> 00:02:12,200
Our parents don't treat us like animals.
No,

47
00:02:12,201 --> 00:02:14,000
they treat us like we do have 
identities.

48
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:14,834
They talked to us like we can understand
what they're saying and what they're 

49
00:02:17,151 --> 00:02:22,151
saying is basically this,
we love you and you are there.

50
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,520
They show us what it is to be 
recognized.

51
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:27,620
Now,
in order for that recognition to blossom

52
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:28,483
into a self,
the baby has to be courageous to risk 

53
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:35,020
that first communication,
mom or a dad.

54
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:35,854
The edit is a risk.
The self is a very tumultuous thing to 

55
00:02:37,971 --> 00:02:40,370
have.
It's much easier just to stay silent,

56
00:02:40,371 --> 00:02:42,860
but those good parents have been very 
encouraging,

57
00:02:42,861 --> 00:02:43,694
will love you.
No matter what they say will apply to 

58
00:02:46,191 --> 00:02:49,430
you or mirror you.
You can trust in this way.

59
00:02:49,431 --> 00:02:50,264
Parents create their children's 
identities by way of self fulfilling 

60
00:02:52,731 --> 00:02:53,564
prophecy.
They predict the identity and then 

61
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:59,440
organize their behavior so as to bring 
it about and the more loving the parent,

62
00:02:59,441 --> 00:03:01,480
the more courageous the baby will be.
Now,

63
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:02,314
the self is not a prize.
It needs to be worked on all the time 

64
00:03:04,631 --> 00:03:07,970
and this too is a constant process of 
self fulfilling prophecy.

65
00:03:07,971 --> 00:03:08,804
Social reality is very flexible.
It's subject to a variety of 

66
00:03:10,961 --> 00:03:11,650
interpretations.

67
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:12,483
We define the world and our place in it 
every single day and as it was our 

68
00:03:15,341 --> 00:03:17,320
parents,
we literally created our identities.

69
00:03:17,321 --> 00:03:22,030
Our conception of how they see us 
remains a huge part of ourselves like it

70
00:03:22,031 --> 00:03:22,864
or not.
And it's the same with friends and 

71
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,513
lovers.
We are all continuously creating one 

72
00:03:26,861 --> 00:03:29,920
another's identities and it's all self 
fulfilling prophecy.

73
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,210
Now,
Justin had a bad day.

74
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:34,510
There's no question about that and it 
was self fulfilling prophecy,

75
00:03:34,511 --> 00:03:35,344
but one thing you didn't see was when I 
called him after the desperate 

76
00:03:37,811 --> 00:03:38,644
housewives disappointment and told them 
about my own shitty day and listen to 

77
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:43,540
his getting off the phone.
I said,

78
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:44,560
don't worry about it,
buddy.

79
00:03:44,561 --> 00:03:45,394
Shit happens.
And you can always vent to me because 

80
00:03:46,901 --> 00:03:48,430
I'm sure as hell can.
I've vent to you.

81
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,370
He laughed and got off the phone,
went to his bed and thought,

82
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:54,130
what a shitty day.
I knew it was going to be Shitty,

83
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,300
but.
Well,

84
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,220
you never know about tomorrow.

85
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,650
Pretty good.
Susan,

86
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:04,500
what are you doing?
My son,

87
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:09,680
my son,
I

88
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:10,693
did.
