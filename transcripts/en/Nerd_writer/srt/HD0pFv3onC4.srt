1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,640
Coffee on a Tuesday and Vlog,
43.

2
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,970
Minimalism is everywhere.

3
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:24,923
It's a style in which the simplest and 
view as elements are used to create the 

4
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:28,794
maximum effect and you can find 
minimalism and almost every art form or 

5
00:00:31,351 --> 00:00:33,810
kind of media in the visual arts and 
music and literature.

6
00:00:33,811 --> 00:00:36,030
You can find it in architecture and 
expensive food,

7
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,430
but most importantly,
I think for the current age,

8
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:41,790
you see it as defining trends in 
advertising and design.

9
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:42,653
The influence here is in good part 
Japanese where Zen Buddhist concepts of 

10
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:49,440
simplicity inform living spaces and ways
of life and not only for its aesthetics,

11
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:53,040
but also as a moral imperative to 
respect the quintessence of thing.

12
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,210
No filmmaker,
for example,

13
00:00:54,211 --> 00:00:57,000
did a better job of capturing this.
Then Yasuhiro,

14
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:01,560
whose films you should watch immediately
after this video is over.

15
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,540
Of course,
camera always placed low to the ground.

16
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:04,374
Ozu films have a two dimensional quality
exhibiting what is essentially an 

17
00:01:07,321 --> 00:01:09,080
organization of geometric shapes.

18
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,990
I never forget the film frame itself is 
directing.

19
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,890
This for me is the key of minimalism.
It's a movement of organized geometry.

20
00:01:16,891 --> 00:01:17,724
The relationships of shapes inside what 
is essentially just a bunch of 

21
00:01:20,431 --> 00:01:21,720
rectangles,
the TB screen,

22
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,220
the computer screen,
the film frame,

23
00:01:23,221 --> 00:01:24,630
the Youtube player,
the billboard,

24
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,370
the street sign,
or the page.

25
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:30,020
A more recent influence is the Dutch 
dish style movement or neoplastic system

26
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:30,893
as Pete Mondrian,
whose paintings you will most certainly 

27
00:01:32,581 --> 00:01:33,414
recognize said it is possible that 
through horizontal and vertical lines 

28
00:01:36,151 --> 00:01:36,984
constructed with awareness but not with 
calculation led by high intuition and 

29
00:01:39,991 --> 00:01:40,824
brought to harmony and rhythm,
that these basic forms of beauty 

30
00:01:43,471 --> 00:01:48,180
supplemented if necessary by other 
direct lines or curves can become a work

31
00:01:48,181 --> 00:01:50,970
of art.
As strong as it is true and it's true,

32
00:01:50,971 --> 00:01:55,350
the geometrical organization is one of 
intuition influenced perhaps by symmetry

33
00:01:55,351 --> 00:01:57,690
and weight in photography by the rule of
thirds,

34
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,240
but finally achieved by a feeling.

35
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,420
This feels right,
comfortable balance.

36
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,100
Take my end screen.
For example,

37
00:02:05,101 --> 00:02:05,934
I must've spent and hour making my newt 
millimeter changes to the elements that 

38
00:02:09,881 --> 00:02:12,480
you see here,
which when paired down look like this,

39
00:02:12,481 --> 00:02:13,314
three rectangles in a circle,
inside a larger rectangle trying to 

40
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:19,320
achieve a kind of harmony between the 
distances and empty blue space.

41
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:20,183
Maybe it was an hour wasted or maybe we 
are more attracted to pieces of design 

42
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,433
that work in the minimal sense.
Maybe in the full appraisal that you 

43
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:29,880
take of my work,
the end screen design,

44
00:02:29,881 --> 00:02:30,930
the framing,
the text,

45
00:02:30,931 --> 00:02:35,010
the pictures reinforce or intensify the 
reaction you have to the content.

46
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,820
The rise of minimalism is symptomatic of
a chaotic culture,

47
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:39,683
bombarded with information.
The organizational impulse is amplified 

48
00:02:42,211 --> 00:02:43,044
and we're drawn to messages or products 
that help us to assemble disparate data 

49
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,510
into a coherent whole.
So instead of this,

50
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,740
we want this and instead of these we use
this,

51
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:55,860
life is marked with contradictory,
but balancing trends.

52
00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:00,890
Tendencies that aim in their way to 
harmonize the of maternity minimalism is

53
00:03:01,361 --> 00:03:02,194
a reminder and a welcome one that in a 
fog of appointments and facebook 

54
00:03:04,961 --> 00:03:05,794
notifications and different types of 
shampoo and homework and real work that 

55
00:03:10,241 --> 00:03:11,074
you can breathe

56
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,920
right.
