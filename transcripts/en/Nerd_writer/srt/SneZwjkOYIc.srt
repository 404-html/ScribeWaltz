1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:03,180
Coffee on a Tuesday and block 36,

2
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:16,270
so living in New York City for a few 
months now.

3
00:00:16,271 --> 00:00:20,320
I've noticed that a lot of the shops and
restaurants are cash now.

4
00:00:20,321 --> 00:00:23,680
This is generally pretty annoying since,
as I imagine a lot of you out there like

5
00:00:23,681 --> 00:00:27,720
me and I've gotten pretty used to paying
for things with credit or debit card.

6
00:00:27,721 --> 00:00:28,554
So the question is why?
Why do so many establishments only 

7
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:35,170
accept cash?
What's the incentive for them to be cash

8
00:00:35,171 --> 00:00:36,004
only in June,
let's say you're buying a $2 cup of 

9
00:00:37,751 --> 00:00:38,351
coffee.
Okay,

10
00:00:38,351 --> 00:00:39,184
so you hand over your credit card to the
Barista who swipes it in her credit 

11
00:00:42,011 --> 00:00:42,460
card.
Trump,

12
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,500
you know you've seen,
you've seen what those things look like.

13
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:45,423
That thing reads the magnetic strip on 
the back of the card and sends the 

14
00:00:48,791 --> 00:00:49,624
transaction to the acquiring bank.
Acquiring Bank pays the coffee shop $2 

15
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:56,740
and the acquiring bank,
it's their $2 from an issuing bank.

16
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,450
Think Citibank,
Wells Fargo,

17
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,313
Bank of America,
which in turn takes the money from your 

18
00:01:01,031 --> 00:01:01,864
account.
This relationship between the coffee 

19
00:01:02,891 --> 00:01:05,650
shop and the acquiring bank is called a 
merchant account.

20
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:06,543
When the coffee shop opened up,
in order to get one of those fancy 

21
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:11,390
credit card terminals,
it had to set up a merchant account with

22
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,810
an acquiring bank.
Then it could take your plastic.

23
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,673
Are you with me so far about merchant 
accounts work and a lot of different 

24
00:01:17,081 --> 00:01:17,914
ways,
but all of them are going to impose a 

25
00:01:19,151 --> 00:01:22,260
certain number of fees on our little 
coffee shop.

26
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:24,550
Some of those feeds come from the 
acquiring bank,

27
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:25,384
but most are coming up through the 
system from the issuing bank set by the 

28
00:01:29,561 --> 00:01:31,000
credit card companies,
mastercard,

29
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:31,811
visa,
discover,

30
00:01:31,811 --> 00:01:32,644
so when our coffee shops swipes your 
card and for every other card and 

31
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:36,094
swipes,
the issuing bank is going to charge a 

32
00:01:37,571 --> 00:01:39,610
small interchange fee.

33
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:40,443
Most commonly these fees are set up into
what's called a three tier pricing 

34
00:01:43,151 --> 00:01:43,900
system.
Now,

35
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:47,470
a normal swipe of the card,
that's going to be first tier and you'll

36
00:01:47,471 --> 00:01:48,304
take the smallest charge of all,
probably about one point two percent of 

37
00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:52,510
the cost.
The fees don't end.

38
00:01:52,511 --> 00:01:54,430
Their car doesn't get accepted the first
time.

39
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,350
That's a nuisance.
Every swipe,

40
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,450
no matter what,
if it's going to the issuing bank,

41
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,553
that's an authorization thing.
At the end of every month you have a 

42
00:02:01,861 --> 00:02:04,150
statement that didn't pay enough and 
these that.

43
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:06,040
Don't worry,
we'll just add a little bit more to make

44
00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:09,310
sure you hit your monthly minimum things
settling out all your days.

45
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:10,210
Purchases.
Well,

46
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:11,043
that's a batch we need to use customer 
service to figure out what the hell is 

47
00:02:13,451 --> 00:02:16,630
going on with all these fees.
Customer service fee.

48
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,340
Okay,
so you've had enough.

49
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,233
You're sick and tired of the fees you 
want out of this credit card thing for 

50
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,200
early termination fee.

51
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,463
Sorry to be sure there are good reasons 
for charging our little coffee shop 

52
00:02:28,451 --> 00:02:29,284
rates and fees.
There is such a thing as transaction 

53
00:02:31,211 --> 00:02:32,740
costs,
but as you can probably guess,

54
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:33,783
there are serious abuses as what an 
enormous antitrust lawsuit which was 

55
00:02:37,061 --> 00:02:37,894
filed by 7 million merchants in 2005 was
settled earlier this year in which the 

56
00:02:42,521 --> 00:02:47,020
car companies paid out seven point 
$3,000,000,000

57
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:48,123
with a beat.
The accusation was that credit card 

58
00:02:49,301 --> 00:02:50,134
companies had colluded with banks to 
engage in anti competitive activities 

59
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:53,943
which allowed them to raise fees higher 
than normal on credit card purchases 

60
00:02:57,191 --> 00:02:58,024
without letting the little coffee shops 
of the world raise their prices to 

61
00:03:00,851 --> 00:03:02,380
accommodate.
In addition to the payout,

62
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,233
the lawsuit changed just that it allows 
merchants to raise their prices to 

63
00:03:06,851 --> 00:03:07,684
accommodate credit card fees.
The thinking was that if they could do 

64
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:12,640
this,
make a dissuade people from using credit

65
00:03:12,641 --> 00:03:13,474
cards and the credit card companies will
be forced to bring the transaction fees 

66
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:18,124
day,
but with a whopping 68 percent of all 

67
00:03:20,621 --> 00:03:24,130
credit card purchases coming from visa 
and mastercard,

68
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:25,323
that may be a pipe dream.
Maybe you can understand why a lot of 

69
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:29,530
small businesses don't accept credit 
cards.

70
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:33,310
They can't afford it and they have to 
hope that people like me will go out and

71
00:03:33,311 --> 00:03:34,144
get the cash instead of going somewhere 
else like starbucks who can handle the 

72
00:03:37,811 --> 00:03:40,450
feets and I would do it too.
I get real money.

73
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,160
The problem is that the ATM next door to
the coffee shop,

74
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:48,460
it charges me 2:50
to take out cash.

75
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,480
Fifty two books,
52 weeks.

76
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:57,530
Fifty two books.
Did you weeks?

77
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,473
If you follow me on Tumbler,
I will feel bad about not reading the 

78
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:02,674
books if I don't read them.
So that's why you should follow me 

79
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:08,380
because you are the ones that are gonna.
Help me finish all these books.

80
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,110
Support small business.
