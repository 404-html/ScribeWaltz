1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:07,320
The Art of performing magic is really 
the art of managing attention up here.

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,590
Look at the car at three to three,
three,

3
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,120
three.
It doesn't matter.

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,213
The general rule of thumb is that when a
magician says that something doesn't 

5
00:00:16,781 --> 00:00:19,420
matter,
the opposite is usually true.

6
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:20,283
For example,
a couple of minutes ago when David 

7
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:22,893
Blaine flipped three more cards into 
what everyone else thinks is a pile of 

8
00:00:25,751 --> 00:00:26,584
10,
then asked to read to put them over his 

9
00:00:27,911 --> 00:00:28,744
heart.
The only thing that matters is that 

10
00:00:30,941 --> 00:00:31,774
Jimmy Fallon chooses the number three 
from this forced flourish so that when 

11
00:00:34,841 --> 00:00:35,674
Blaine says that three cards will 
magically fly from his deck into creeks 

12
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:39,933
hand,
the 13 cards will be there and everyone 

13
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:44,270
will freak out.
10 zero.

14
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:52,030
Did you catch it that time?
Ten,

15
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:52,973
10,
zero.

16
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:59,440
There's three and there's four more.
Now there's 20 cards.

17
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:06,803
This is a great trick from David Blaine 
and it functions on a simple concept 

18
00:01:09,841 --> 00:01:13,470
which all magic depends on selective 
attention.

19
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,270
The idea that the eyes and the mind can 
only focus on one thing at a time.

20
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:19,343
This principle is something that 
magicians have known for centuries in 

21
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,360
the earliest known book of Magic and 
English Hocus pocus.

22
00:01:24,361 --> 00:01:29,190
The author includes in his four required
skills for magic tricks such gestures of

23
00:01:29,191 --> 00:01:30,024
body as may lead the spectators eyes 
from a strict and diligent beholding of 

24
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,270
his manner of conveyance.
A few hundred years later,

25
00:01:36,271 --> 00:01:37,104
scientists began conducting tests on 
selective attention like this one from 

26
00:01:40,471 --> 00:01:44,250
deckland serve owned from 1983,
which asked subjects to count the number

27
00:01:44,251 --> 00:01:45,084
of times the white shirted players pass 
the ball back and forth and this in 

28
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:50,130
other tests like it.
A majority of people,

29
00:01:50,131 --> 00:01:50,964
more than half fail to see the woman 
with the umbrella walking directly 

30
00:01:54,661 --> 00:01:56,280
through the middle of the scene.

31
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,263
The important thing to note is that 
selected the tension is something that 

32
00:01:59,311 --> 00:02:02,100
organizes our entire experience as human
beings,

33
00:02:02,101 --> 00:02:03,810
not just our vision.
I mean,

34
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,290
David Blaine may be distracting Jimmy 
Fallon and the roots when he loads these

35
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:08,124
extra cards into the pile,
but what's more amazing than the slight 

36
00:02:10,381 --> 00:02:11,214
of hand is that he's doing it in exactly
the place where everyone is looking and 

37
00:02:15,511 --> 00:02:19,980
this shows just how powerful selective 
attention can be in magic.

38
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,920
Manipulating attention is fun.
It's what we expect,

39
00:02:22,921 --> 00:02:25,950
but it's not the only place we find this
kind of activity.

40
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:30,540
Let's take a look at another trick.
Are you watching closely on Sunday,

41
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:31,403
November 27th,
The New York Times published a 

42
00:02:32,971 --> 00:02:36,780
comprehensive piece of good journalism 
detailing country by country,

43
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:37,614
the empire of business interests that 
Donald trump has around the globe and 

44
00:02:41,101 --> 00:02:43,800
how they might conflict with his job as 
president.

45
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:46,200
The story was at the top of the front 
page.

46
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:50,460
Then at around 1230 that afternoon,
trump tweeted this,

47
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:54,000
in addition to winning the electoral 
college in a landslide,

48
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,900
I won the popular vote.
If you deduct the millions of people who

49
00:02:57,901 --> 00:03:00,400
voted illegally,
make no mistake.

50
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,460
This is a kind of magic trick like David
Blaine,

51
00:03:03,461 --> 00:03:04,294
like any magician,
Donald Trump is using selective 

52
00:03:06,401 --> 00:03:07,234
attention for his own gain.
He's misdirecting sucking all the air 

53
00:03:10,361 --> 00:03:12,130
out of a story that he wants you to 
forget.

54
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,313
Mr [inaudible] is not new to politics.
Politicians have been manipulating our 

55
00:03:15,851 --> 00:03:16,684
attention for years.
I mean when the public asks a question 

56
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:23,560
politicians figured out long ago that 
rather than actually answer it,

57
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,130
it's much,
much better to change the question.

58
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,410
When you address negative publicity on 
its own terms,

59
00:03:29,411 --> 00:03:31,480
you end up with stuff like this.

60
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,590
People have got to know whether or not 
their president is a crook.

61
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,090
Well,
I'm not a crook.

62
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,670
I earned everything I've got.

63
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:42,350
Instead of moving attention away from 
the question of his criminality,

64
00:03:42,351 --> 00:03:46,760
Nixon aim the focus directly onto that 
issue by denying it outright.

65
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:48,043
A better magic trick is something that 
happened a few years earlier when 

66
00:03:50,511 --> 00:03:53,450
Vietnam war protests were gripping the 
country in the 19 sixties,

67
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:58,010
politicians and elites who supported the
war didn't address the protestors actual

68
00:03:58,011 --> 00:04:00,320
concerns about the legitimacy of the 
conflict.

69
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,573
Instead,
they reframed the antiwar protests as 

70
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:04,933
anti troop protests,
and this political sleight of hand has 

71
00:04:08,511 --> 00:04:11,570
proven really fruitful and undercutting 
protesters,

72
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,180
not just the Vietnam War,
the Gulf War,

73
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,500
and the war on terror.

74
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:17,243
Scare every American to find a way to 
thank the men and women who are 

75
00:04:21,641 --> 00:04:22,630
defending our freedom.

76
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,690
I'm Donald Trump.
Takes this a step further.

77
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,010
He uses twitter to maneuver attention 
away from negative press,

78
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:31,323
but he doesn't reframe the debate so 
much as distract the country with 

79
00:04:34,421 --> 00:04:37,510
statements so glaringly false and 
controversial,

80
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:42,700
but the media is forced to expend its 
energy on refuting them or covering them

81
00:04:42,701 --> 00:04:43,534
because they have to because the winning
president elect saying without evidence 

82
00:04:46,421 --> 00:04:47,254
that millions of people voted illegally 
will get ratings because when the 

83
00:04:50,711 --> 00:04:54,130
president makes a force of the 
presidency,

84
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:59,320
that is in some sad way newsworthy,
and then when you're done covering that,

85
00:04:59,321 --> 00:05:00,154
a new tweet comes in that says flag 
burners should perhaps lose their 

86
00:05:02,441 --> 00:05:04,390
citizenship or be sent to jail for a 
year.

87
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,400
I mean,
it's really amazing.

88
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:11,350
The attention goes where he wants it to 
go and without the pressure of sustained

89
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,213
focus.
The Chairman of the House oversight 

90
00:05:13,841 --> 00:05:16,000
committee is free to brush the real 
issue.

91
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:16,863
The one we all forgot about aside,
I think you can expect this kind of 

92
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:23,560
thing for the next four years.
Expect every substantive criticism to be

93
00:05:23,561 --> 00:05:24,394
met with a ridiculous tweet.
It's time for all of us to start 

94
00:05:27,371 --> 00:05:28,204
thinking of our own attention as a 
limited and valuable resource because 

95
00:05:32,741 --> 00:05:33,574
when you do,
you can be a little more certain that 

96
00:05:35,861 --> 00:05:37,720
the card,
your choosing.

97
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:42,160
It's actually yours.
Stop.

98
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:47,070
There is a new nerd writer video every 
Wednesday guys.

99

101
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:52,823
Sorry,
David Blaine for revealing how your 

102
00:05:53,611 --> 00:05:54,460
trick is done.
Um,

103
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,940
but it was a useful metaphor for what I 
wanted to talk about.

104
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,710
Thank you to squarespace for sponsoring 
this video.

intuitive websites where you can go and 

106
00:06:02,991 --> 00:06:04,760
make a website without having to know 
coding.

107
00:06:04,761 --> 00:06:05,594
I made one called the nerd writer.net,
which you can check out and see sort of 

108
00:06:07,431 --> 00:06:09,230
an example.

112
00:06:17,451 --> 00:06:20,060
That's a huge thing for me as as a lot 
of you guys know.

113
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:22,610
Anyway else.
See the rest of you next Wednesday.
