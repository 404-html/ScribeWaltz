1
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:15,890
Who was the first person to ever have 
the idea of traveling through time?

2
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,513
If I had to guess,
I'd say it was probably an early human 

3
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:20,693
tens of thousands of years ago who 
stubbed his toe or tripped or lit his 

4
00:00:24,271 --> 00:00:27,600
hair on fire and in searing pain had the
thought,

5
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,170
I wish I would have not done that in 
this really limited way.

6
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,440
Time travel as an idea.
It's probably as old as regret,

7
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:37,350
which is to say as old as humanity 
itself,

8
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,273
human beings have an instinctive sense 
for cause and effect and a particular 

9
00:00:42,271 --> 00:00:43,104
skill for manipulating causes to get the
effects that they want and it makes 

10
00:00:47,131 --> 00:00:47,964
sense that are wandering minds would 
look at the effects of what's already 

11
00:00:50,581 --> 00:00:51,414
happened in wonder what things might 
look like if the causes had been 

12
00:00:54,661 --> 00:00:57,390
different somehow.
Which makes it kind of weird that time.

13
00:00:57,391 --> 00:01:02,280
Travel as a device to tell stories is a 
relatively recent phenomenon.

14
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:03,463
It might not seem that way since 
traveling through time is such a staple 

15
00:01:05,641 --> 00:01:08,700
of modern science fiction and really the
modern imagination.

16
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:13,050
We've been so saturated with time 
traveling novels and TV shows and movies

17
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:14,213
that the average person pretty much 
understands all the basic concepts and 

18
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:18,323
paradox,
but the time travel genre is only about 

19
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:25,230
100 years old and change depending on 
where you mark the beginning.

20
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,790
Many people see hg wells,
the time machine in 1895 as the start of

21
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:32,130
the genre.
Others look to mark Twain's,

22
00:01:32,131 --> 00:01:35,460
a Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's 
court from a few years later.

23
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,473
Some even cite Charles Dickens' a 
Christmas carol with it's ghost of 

24
00:01:39,061 --> 00:01:42,150
Christmas,
past and future from 1843.

25
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:43,463
The truth is you can't really pinpoint a
specific novel as the genesis of time 

26
00:01:46,951 --> 00:01:51,390
travel fiction because the genre doesn't
pop into existence out of nowhere,

27
00:01:51,391 --> 00:01:56,391
like Cyborg from the future.
It grew slowly from the ashes of a genre

28
00:01:56,581 --> 00:01:57,414
that no one really knows about anymore,
but to understand that there is one 

29
00:02:01,111 --> 00:02:05,010
specific book you can mention in more 
ways than one.

30
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:05,903
Charles Darwin's on the origin of 
species triggered a sea change in 

31
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:13,350
science and culture after origin was 
published in 1859.

32
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,213
The idea of evolution,
not necessarily the idea of natural 

33
00:02:16,861 --> 00:02:20,490
selection was adopted fast,
really fast,

34
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,533
just a decade later,
evolution was assumed at several top 

35
00:02:24,571 --> 00:02:27,840
universities and it filtered down into 
the popular consciousness.

36
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:31,140
It colored the way people thought,
not just about biology,

37
00:02:31,141 --> 00:02:31,974
but about sociology too.
If species we're getting fitter and 

38
00:02:35,551 --> 00:02:36,780
fitter,
better and better.

39
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:38,003
Why not societies?
It's in this period that a certain kind 

40
00:02:40,501 --> 00:02:41,334
of novel becomes really popular.
It's called the Utopian Romance and it 

41
00:02:46,231 --> 00:02:49,260
culminates in Edward Bellamy's 1888 
book,

42
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,393
looking backward in Bellamy's book,
the hero Julian West falls into a deep 

43
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:58,820
hypnotic sleep and wakes up 113 years 
later in the year 2000.

44
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,710
The world is totally changed into a 
socialist utopia.

45
00:03:02,711 --> 00:03:03,544
Essentially Bellamy's version of the 
perfect society evolved out of the 

46
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,673
Society of his own day.

47
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:09,813
The book was a huge success.
The second novel in all of American 

48
00:03:12,671 --> 00:03:16,390
literature to sell over a million copies
like successful things do,

49
00:03:16,391 --> 00:03:17,224
it exploded the genre,
resulting in dozens and dozens of 

50
00:03:19,391 --> 00:03:20,224
Utopian stories written along a very 
similar structure and with evolution as 

51
00:03:23,921 --> 00:03:24,754
the guiding principle utopias,
we're no longer on a last island or a 

52
00:03:28,331 --> 00:03:29,164
different world.
They were in the future in his 

53
00:03:33,761 --> 00:03:35,650
extraordinary book on time travel 
fiction,

54
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,513
David Wittenberg shows that overtime the
utopian romance became really 

55
00:03:40,061 --> 00:03:43,360
preoccupied with how its heroes got to 
the future.

56
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:46,840
A lot of the time people fell asleep and
woke up years later.

57
00:03:46,841 --> 00:03:47,674
Other times,
people's minds were sent forward and 

58
00:03:49,691 --> 00:03:52,870
were able to come back.
People traveled to the future in hot air

59
00:03:52,871 --> 00:03:53,704
balloons by lightening storms,
even once with the use of a special 

60
00:03:57,011 --> 00:03:58,300
shampoo.
In fact,

61
00:03:58,301 --> 00:04:02,080
when hg wells solves the problem with 
the mechanical time machine,

62
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:03,123
he's doing it for the same reason as 
everybody else to create a realistic 

63
00:04:06,401 --> 00:04:09,760
frame for his own Utopian story or in 
this case,

64
00:04:09,761 --> 00:04:12,230
his criticism and satire of that shot.

65
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:13,563
Eventually,
the Utopian craze fell under the weight 

66
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:19,750
of its own propaganda.
Today barely anyone reads or writes that

67
00:04:19,751 --> 00:04:24,490
kind of fiction and nobody knows the 
name of the author or the book that sold

68
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:28,780
a million copies 100 years ago,
but as Utopian fiction collapsed,

69
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:33,370
it left us with a framing device that 
grew into its own genre.

70
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,900
That's where,
or rather when time travel fiction as we

71
00:04:37,901 --> 00:04:40,360
know it comes from in the following 
decades,

72
00:04:40,361 --> 00:04:43,870
the genre would be transformed by the 
discoveries of Einstein.

73
00:04:43,871 --> 00:04:44,704
It would use a popular understanding of 
space time to probe the paradoxes of 

74
00:04:48,251 --> 00:04:51,040
causality that we've all become so 
familiar with,

75
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,083
but is Wittenberg notes time.
Travel fiction is essentially the child 

76
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:59,110
of narrative itself.
Examining the nature of causality is the

77
00:04:59,111 --> 00:04:59,944
same thing as examining the nature of 
story because that's what a story is 

78
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:06,010
caused an effect.
It's white time travel.

79
00:05:06,011 --> 00:05:08,650
Movies and books are obsessed with 
rules.

80
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,170
They're like laboratories of 
storytelling.

81
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:14,650
Just create a world,
establish its rules,

82
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:18,040
and to ask what's possible.

83
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:26,080
Hey everybody,
thank you so much for watching.

84
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,490
This episode was sponsored by the new 
youtube red original series,

85
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,590
lifeline.
It's the first,

86
00:05:32,591 --> 00:05:33,424
the very first Saifai narrative series 
that red has produced about a company 

87
00:05:37,061 --> 00:05:37,894
called lifeline that sends its agents 
into the future to save clients that 

88
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,753
they know are going to die.
It's a really great concept and 

89
00:05:45,281 --> 00:05:49,750
personally I'm super excited that red is
actually green lighting shows like this.

90
00:05:49,751 --> 00:05:52,810
I hope the future brings more by 
talented creators.

91
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:53,644
In this case,
Sam and Nico from corridor digital are 

92
00:05:55,391 --> 00:05:58,750
directing the entire series and I've 
been a fan of theirs for a while.
