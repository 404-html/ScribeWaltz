1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:02,873
Much like game of thrones before it,
Hbo Westworld is an elaborate at big 

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,153
puzzle box of a production that serves 
in the end as an excuse to explore 

3
00:00:11,551 --> 00:00:15,270
something much smaller and much more 
important character.

4
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:16,343
This is why despite the sweeping vistas 
what holds everything else up or the 

5
00:00:20,011 --> 00:00:20,844
conversations,
how they're written and how they're 

6
00:00:22,711 --> 00:00:23,544
acted,
and today I want to take a look at one 

7
00:00:24,961 --> 00:00:27,180
conversation featuring the Great Anthony
Hopkins.

8
00:00:27,181 --> 00:00:28,014
Specifically,
I want to examine how hopkins acts the 

9
00:00:30,151 --> 00:00:30,984
scene,
how he elevates every line of dialogue 

10
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:37,500
to a hypnotically interesting level.
You'll imagine I've gone mad.

11
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:43,850
You lost my way.
Simply concerned about the extent of the

12
00:00:43,891 --> 00:00:47,340
changes you're making.
You want to protect the legacy.

13
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,740
My legacy.
Okay.

14
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:50,603
The background of the scene is that 
Teresa Colon and operations manager of 

15
00:00:53,581 --> 00:00:54,414
the westworld theme park is trying to 
stop or at least stall the creation of 

16
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:01,680
Robert for Anthony Hopkins,
new storyline for the guests.

17
00:01:01,681 --> 00:01:05,160
The storyline that is generally wreaking
chaos on things to the point of worrying

18
00:01:05,161 --> 00:01:05,994
the parks financier's.
It's clear that Theresa feels that 

19
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:09,003
Ford's undertaking is just too risky,
but instead of forthrightly telling him 

20
00:01:11,911 --> 00:01:16,410
so she puts things in euphemistic terms,
you want to protect your legacy

21
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:18,093
legacy.

22
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:25,813
Okay,
that pause is fully seven seconds long 

23
00:01:27,471 --> 00:01:32,270
and it is amazing after reacting in 
disbelief at such a shameless euphemism,

24
00:01:32,271 --> 00:01:33,104
hopkins in silence cycles through a few 
emotions first disbelief than a 

25
00:01:38,841 --> 00:01:42,590
consideration of the words for a split 
second at their face value.

26
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,633
Maybe he should safeguard his legacy.
Maybe he shouldn't be so ambitious at 

27
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,930
his age.
Then a smile and this scene will feature

28
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,793
several shades of smile.
This one is kind as kind as can be in 

29
00:01:55,191 --> 00:01:57,110
the face of what he considers to be an 
attack.

30
00:01:57,111 --> 00:02:01,430
One that insults his intelligence as he 
looks down and chuckles.

31
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:04,910
The smile seems to acquire some 
suppressed anger.

32
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,810
You can only bear to look at her in 
quick glances as he composes himself.

33
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,620
Then he fires back and antagonistic 
remark.

34
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,470
You're done.
Like this space that amounts to.

35
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:17,733
I've seen many of you come and go over 
the years and I can tell the ones who 

36
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:23,080
enjoy the time here,
the ones who don't.

37
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:24,483
What's impressive here is how hopkins 
breaks down the dialogue as written in 

38
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:28,803
interviews.
Hopkins has described how he reads 

39
00:02:30,071 --> 00:02:30,904
scripts 200 times or so to the point 
where the dialogue is lodged in his 

40
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:36,660
brain that he steps away.
Let's sit,

41
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,130
gestate in his mind,
and when he arrives on set,

42
00:02:39,131 --> 00:02:39,964
he relaxes himself and let the punk days
where you by having such a command over 

43
00:02:44,771 --> 00:02:48,340
the words,
hopkins is able to modulate the tempo of

44
00:02:48,341 --> 00:02:50,410
their delivery to get the most out of 
it.

45
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,820
This sentence,
for example,

46
00:02:51,821 --> 00:02:52,654
is spread through.
I've seen many of you come and go over 

47
00:02:54,551 --> 00:02:56,560
the years and as as the first part of 
the next sentence,

48
00:02:56,561 --> 00:03:00,100
until a pause,
after who drawing out the word enjoy,

49
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:02,320
which falls right back into a speedy 
delivery,

50
00:03:02,321 --> 00:03:05,710
almost slipping over the words until the
final two,

51
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,280
which coupled with icontact,
slowed down to function.

52
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,173
As an accusation.
I've seen many of you come and go over 

53
00:03:11,501 --> 00:03:16,310
the years and I can tell the ones who 
enjoy the time on pseudo.

54
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:21,470
I admire it,
the audacity of it,

55
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:23,973
a small interjection,
but see how he opens up like a flower 

56
00:03:26,681 --> 00:03:27,514
from the hunched position,
how he releases a little tension to 

57
00:03:30,011 --> 00:03:32,140
receive the compliment.
Great touch.

58
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:34,930
I came there once as a child with my 
parents.

59
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:39,910
I think we even sat at this table when I
started working here.

60
00:03:39,911 --> 00:03:40,744
I realized this place wasn't something I
would enjoy and then we get a second 

61
00:03:44,861 --> 00:03:47,140
interjection.
When his suspicions are confirmed,

62
00:03:47,141 --> 00:03:50,500
followed by hunching again and at the 
fleeted neck.

63
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:54,250
Then from this position,
Hopkins launches into his key speech.

64
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:56,973
In the beginning,
I imagined things would be perfectly 

65
00:03:59,891 --> 00:04:04,250
balanced.
Even the beds with my partner Arnold,

66
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:07,590
to that effect,
they made 100 hopeful storylines.

67
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,790
Of course,
almost no one took us up on the last.

68
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:11,723
The bad.
Arnold always held a somewhat dim view 

69
00:04:16,721 --> 00:04:18,850
of people.
He preferred the hosts.

70
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:22,230
They begged me not to let you people in 
the money,

71
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,830
man,
tell us,

72
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:24,963
okay,
we're about to learn that this whole 

73
00:04:25,841 --> 00:04:26,674
meeting is a threat setup by Hopkins and
to signal that Hopkins incrementally 

74
00:04:30,551 --> 00:04:31,384
dials up the menace across three terms 
that specify who he threatening you 

75
00:04:35,381 --> 00:04:36,430
people,
money,

76
00:04:36,431 --> 00:04:38,320
men delos,
listen to it again.

77
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:41,440
They begged me not to let you people in 
the money,

78
00:04:41,441 --> 00:04:44,330
men Delis,
but I told him,

79
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:47,200
if you find that you didn't understand 
what you are paying for,

80
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:48,813
it's not a business venture.
Now seem an entire world designed every 

81
00:04:55,961 --> 00:04:56,794
inch of it,

82
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:04,750
every blade of grass in here.
We have a God's Mandy August.

83
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:12,823
Watching this,
the first time it was here that it 

84
00:05:14,061 --> 00:05:18,620
struck me how crucial Ford's personality
is to the functioning of the series.

85
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:19,663
I mean,
westworld is in many ways a ridiculous 

86
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:25,310
idea both as a theme park and as a TV 
show to work.

87
00:05:25,311 --> 00:05:28,310
The conceit had to be mapped,
reflected,

88
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:33,320
justified in the complex desires and 
ambitions of its creators.

89
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:37,580
The writers have achieved that in Fort,
but it's hopkins who really brings these

90
00:05:37,581 --> 00:05:41,670
things to light and how did that work?
For sadly,

91
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,010
he lost his perspective.
He went mad.

92
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,120
I haven't,
as you well know,

93
00:05:50,121 --> 00:05:55,121
I've always seen things very clearly the
threat now,

94
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,710
explicit hopkins colors the rest of the 
scene with a sinister glean.

95
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:05,910
This is the table I sat with my parents.
They know everything about our guests.

96
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:09,680
Don't pay as we know everything about 
our employees.

97
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:13,100
From here on out,
he presses his advantage not with force,

98
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,350
but with comfort,
with a smile,

99
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:18,260
no longer needing to convince Teresa of 
his dominance,

100
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:19,303
hopkins dances and different attitudes 
for a couple of seconds before falling 

101
00:06:22,911 --> 00:06:25,940
back into that smile like right here 
where he's.

102
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:26,773
Matter of fact,
we know everything about our guests 

103
00:06:28,461 --> 00:06:29,294
don't pay as we know everything about 
our employees or here where he's 

104
00:06:33,201 --> 00:06:34,034
concerned,
I do hope he will be careful with a nod 

105
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,850
or here where he's genuinely caring as 
his eyes wander off for a moment too.

106
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,033
It has a sensitive disposition.
The producers of the show are smart to 

107
00:06:49,251 --> 00:06:50,084
keep the camera fixed on Hopkins face.
His ability learned across many decades 

108
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:55,933
to convey such a web of feeling and 
suggest such a universe of feeling 

109
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:04,010
within about a character we know little 
about expands.

110
00:07:04,011 --> 00:07:09,011
The entire shows range and strengthens 
it's persuasive power as a piece of art.

111
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:14,120
That's what a great actor can do.
You can give words and images or a short

112
00:07:14,121 --> 00:07:19,121
scene like this of volcanic energy with 
the quiet look and Anthony Hopkins hands

113
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:24,980
in his eyes.
Westworld isn't just a reflection of its

114
00:07:24,981 --> 00:07:28,160
creators personality.
It's a self portrait.

115
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,083
You can tell the board that I needed to 
be completed on time and it won't be a 

116
00:07:33,861 --> 00:07:38,861
retrospective as I'm sure you have so 
sentimental.

117
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:56,200
How.

118
00:07:58,990 --> 00:07:59,823
Hey everybody,
there is a new nerd writer video every 

119
00:08:01,431 --> 00:08:03,240
Wednesday,
so if you click right there,

120
00:08:03,241 --> 00:08:05,480
you'll subscribe to this channel and get
all the videos.

121
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:06,613
Sorry,
I've been so irregular with my posting 

122
00:08:07,611 --> 00:08:08,900
recently.
I've been in Italy.

123
00:08:08,901 --> 00:08:09,734
It's been crazy,
but also have been writing a couple of 

124
00:08:10,401 --> 00:08:12,050
speeches for the Singapore Writers 
Festival,

125
00:08:12,051 --> 00:08:13,780
which I'll be at in a couple of weeks.
Um,

126
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,350
and so that's been taking a lot of my 
time.

127
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:18,710
I have to shout out a channel that I 
really love called wisecrack.

128
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,650
They do video essays like me,
eight,

129
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,070
the philosophy,
earthlink,

130
00:08:22,071 --> 00:08:22,831
cinema,
stuff like that.

131
00:08:22,831 --> 00:08:24,350
They just did something on bojack 
horseman,

132
00:08:24,351 --> 00:08:26,240
which is a show I love and the video is 
great too,

133
00:08:26,241 --> 00:08:28,100
so I'll link that below.
Check that out.

134
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:31,700
Thanks guys for watching.
I'll see everybody next Wednesday.

135
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:32,563
Hopefully.
