1
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:08,663
I started analyzing paintings as a way 
to confront the problem of not engaging 

2
00:00:12,781 --> 00:00:16,410
with certain forms of genres of art.
I mean you stand at a museum,

3
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:21,420
look at a Kandinsky or a monet or Surat,
and wonder what exactly am I supposed to

4
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:22,883
feel here?
Certain paintings seem particularly 

5
00:00:25,201 --> 00:00:26,034
stubborn,
unwilling to move even an inch in your 

6
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:28,494
direction,
leaving you with a massive void to fill 

7
00:00:30,631 --> 00:00:31,464
with unanchored interpretation,
but what about paintings that do the 

8
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,330
opposite?
Rename a greets.

9
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:43,400
The treachery of images moves more than 
an inch in the direction of the viewer.

10
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:45,203
It goes all the way.
The painting speaks in a language that 

11
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:51,870
we can understand,
which is to say language itself,

12
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,760
sustain.
Pass on peep.

13
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,170
This is not a pipe.
The painting actually says something.

14
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,240
It engages.
It talks.

15
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,060
So what's it trying to say?
First,

16
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:05,180
let's talk for a moment about renamer 
greed.

17
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,520
One of the most famous and lasting of 
the surrealist artists.

18
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:11,940
A man who never really thought of 
himself as a painter,

19
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:12,803
more a thinker that used images to 
express himself once he landed on an 

20
00:01:16,741 --> 00:01:17,574
aesthetic style.
It never really changed or evolved 

21
00:01:19,531 --> 00:01:20,364
throughout his career.
Well versed in philosophical writing 

22
00:01:22,501 --> 00:01:27,450
from Plato to Food Co,
he used that style to investigate ideas.

23
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,170
His program was to confuse,
to evoke mystery,

24
00:01:31,171 --> 00:01:32,004
to show us that what we want is always 
behind the thing we see and that the 

25
00:01:37,201 --> 00:01:38,034
obstruction can never be removed 
completely because it's not in the 

26
00:01:41,131 --> 00:01:45,000
object.
It's envisioned and thought itself.

27
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,210
The treachery of images approaches these
themes directly.

28
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,060
The painting at first is obvious in its 
message.

29
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:55,800
It shows an image of a pipe and then 
underneath the image it tells or reminds

30
00:01:55,801 --> 00:02:00,801
the viewer that this is not a pipe and 
we can infer the rest.

31
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,673
Obviously that's not a pipe.
It's a representation of a pipe and 

32
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,310
regret means to show us that 
representations are not the real thing.

33
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:13,050
They only resemble the real thing,
but of course that's common sense.

34
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,660
Who in the world would argue the 
opposite position,

35
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,450
but a curious question comes out of 
this.

36
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:22,410
If someone showed you this image and 
asked you what it was,

37
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:25,800
what would you say?
Probably you'd say it's an apple,

38
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,780
right?
Or what about this image?

39
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,240
It's a man or this.
This is a train.

40
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,370
This is a house,
this is a dog.

41
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,680
This is a hand.
This is a pipe.

42
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:39,240
This little accident of language is not 
really an accident at all.

43
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:42,780
For many hundreds of years,
human beings have supposed that language

44
00:02:42,781 --> 00:02:43,614
and reality had an organic relationship 
that the names of things in a way arose 

45
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:48,923
out of the things themselves,
that a tree was in fact a tree that 

46
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:58,190
Kanye West is in fact Kanye west and 
that a pipe is really a pipe.

47
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:03,520
All of that was challenged by the famous
linguist Ferdinand and sauce.

48
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,393
You're an extremely influential figure 
who saw that a thing and it's name have 

49
00:03:08,411 --> 00:03:13,411
a totally arbitrary relationship that we
don't really know things but only access

50
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,273
their shadow through language in which 
everything has a meaning in the context 

51
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,373
of the system.
After so many centuries of trusting the 

52
00:03:22,721 --> 00:03:25,840
word implicitly,
these insights were hard.

53
00:03:25,841 --> 00:03:26,674
One so hard,
one that marguerite saw that the old 

54
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,270
wrongheaded ways of thinking about 
language.

55
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:35,860
We're still hiding in the way we thought
and talked about images.

56
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,023
Realistic painting plays on resemblance 
and resemblance suggests a hierarchy 

57
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,303
that the image of a pipe resembles that 
it points outside language to the thing 

58
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:47,883
in itself.
The falseness of this claim is what 

59
00:03:49,331 --> 00:03:53,980
inspired the abstract artists to move 
beyond resemblance into a field in which

60
00:03:53,981 --> 00:03:57,370
painting had no reference in reality.
As such,

61
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,233
we agreed on the other hand,
makes this point using the false 

62
00:04:00,971 --> 00:04:04,420
premises of resemblance and shatters 
them from within.

63
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,720
The visual secret dependence on language
is laid bare in the treachery of images.

64
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:10,743
Indeed,
that dependence is the treachery of 

65
00:04:13,001 --> 00:04:13,834
images.
Here we have an image and a sentence 

66
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:20,470
laid out like a page from a botanical 
textbook begging to be connected,

67
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,513
but why should we connect them?
Why should the sentence and the image 

68
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:28,420
refer to one another?
How do we know that the word this points

69
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,610
upward?
Of course we don't know,

70
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:33,370
but the Pronoun,
the resemblance and the name,

71
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:38,850
I'll make that connection inevitable and
it's that inevitability that's made real

72
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,233
in every aspect of our lives.
We go about our days confident that 

73
00:04:43,511 --> 00:04:47,680
everything we see could be said and that
the images we say it could be seen,

74
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:50,950
but if you've ever used the phrase you 
had to be there,

75
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,023
you know that these are two realities 
that do not overlap in the way we act 

76
00:04:55,931 --> 00:04:58,600
like they do.
This is not a pipe.

77
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:02,470
Yes,
but this is not a pipe either.

78
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:03,933
And if this is not a pipe than the 
sentence scrawled in it's cute 

79
00:05:06,251 --> 00:05:09,550
schoolboy.
Cursive is actually a contradiction.

80
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:14,350
The contradiction that pulls the whole 
painting apart at the seams and makes it

81
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,273
utter nonsense.
I don't know if Margaret laughed about 

82
00:05:17,861 --> 00:05:18,694
that,
but I hope he did because what's more 

83
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:21,154
forceful,
not moving an inch in the direction of 

84
00:05:23,471 --> 00:05:24,304
the viewer or moving a question all the 
way into the center of the viewer's 

85
00:05:28,301 --> 00:05:29,134
mind.
That on the slightest prodding and 

86
00:05:30,941 --> 00:05:33,830
examination implodes.

87
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:40,400
Hey everybody,
thanks for watching.

88
00:05:40,401 --> 00:05:41,110
Boy,
that was,

89
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,560
that was really fun to do.
Um,

90
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,753
I wanted to let you know that there are 
only five nerd writer mugs left on my 

91
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,103
patrion page.
So if you want to claim one of the last 

92
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,360
few,
click anywhere here on the mug or in the

93
00:05:50,361 --> 00:05:51,320
description.
Also,

94
00:05:51,321 --> 00:05:52,154
a lot of people in the last video 
commented who didn't live in the US 

95
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:55,880
saying they might also be interested in 
a mug.

96
00:05:55,881 --> 00:05:56,714
So if you are,
let me know in comments below so that I 

97
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,024
can gauge interest in.
Maybe we can do a whole separate batch 

98
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:01,813
for you guys.
Thank you so much for supporting me on 

99
00:06:03,411 --> 00:06:04,910
Patrion guys.
Really it is.

100
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:06,380
I say this again and again,
but it.

101
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:08,990
It is what makes this channel possible.
It wouldn't exist.

102
00:06:08,991 --> 00:06:13,220
The nerd writer would not exist without 
your help and I am trying to build it up

103
00:06:13,221 --> 00:06:15,980
a little by little.
It's a model for supporting content that

104
00:06:15,981 --> 00:06:16,940
I really believe in.
I mean,

105
00:06:16,941 --> 00:06:20,210
you pay to get the content that you 
want.

106
00:06:20,211 --> 00:06:23,150
There's nothing in between you and me.
It's just me and you.

107
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,340
A,
it's a beautiful break.

108
00:06:24,341 --> 00:06:25,400
It's my birthday today.
Actually.

109
00:06:25,401 --> 00:06:26,234
It will be my birthday yesterday,
but it's a beautiful birthday gift from 

110
00:06:27,741 --> 00:06:30,800
you guys and I will see you guys next 
Wednesday.
