1
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:04,993
Looking back at the 19th century,
it's possible to say that the extreme 

2
00:00:08,631 --> 00:00:09,464
popularity of serial novel,
the novel released in installments over 

3
00:00:13,761 --> 00:00:17,360
time was inevitable in London,
changing economics.

4
00:00:17,361 --> 00:00:19,850
We're creating the perfect conditions 
for this to happen.

5
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:22,190
Thousands of people were moving into the
city.

6
00:00:22,191 --> 00:00:25,730
Literacy among the lower and middle 
classes was increasing.

7
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:29,480
A new printing and distribution 
technologies were coming into their own,

8
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:30,373
but the magic that made cereal such a 
huge success wasn't only in the 

9
00:00:33,831 --> 00:00:34,664
conditions of the times and publisher's 
like Chapman and hall knew that it was 

10
00:00:38,601 --> 00:00:42,770
also in the genius of upstarts like the 
one they chose.

11
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:43,783
A young writer named Charles Dickens,
Chapman and whole commission dickens to 

12
00:00:46,851 --> 00:00:47,684
write a few sporting stories to be 
released with sketches done by the 

13
00:00:50,661 --> 00:00:52,010
artists,
Richard Seymour.

14
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,200
Altogether.
The project was called the posh,

15
00:00:54,201 --> 00:00:58,070
the papers of the pickwick club or the 
pickwick papers for sure.

16
00:00:58,580 --> 00:00:59,413
The first part was horrendous failure.
Only 400 copies were sold after the 

17
00:01:03,801 --> 00:01:06,890
second part seem more committed suicide 
and had to be replaced.

18
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:08,053
It wasn't until the fifth installment 
when Dickins introduced a funny working 

19
00:01:11,331 --> 00:01:15,740
class character named Sam dweller that 
the project struck gold,

20
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:19,730
whether it was a massive hit and after 
the insistence of the readership,

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,833
the character was expanded throughout 
the rest of the series launching its 

22
00:01:23,091 --> 00:01:28,091
sales from 400 to 40,000
for installment thanks to Dickens,

23
00:01:28,971 --> 00:01:30,860
thanks to publishers like Chapman at 
hall,

24
00:01:30,861 --> 00:01:34,190
thanks to new printing presses and 
liberal education in railways.

25
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:38,690
The serial novel dominated the world of 
literature for the next 60 years,

26
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:41,360
and though most novels these days aren't
published,

27
00:01:41,361 --> 00:01:42,194
like the pickwick papers were the genre 
of serialization and it is a genre has 

28
00:01:46,761 --> 00:01:47,594
proven to be remarkably strong 
flourishing and almost every 

29
00:01:50,481 --> 00:01:51,314
storytelling medium,
and this is no accident as Jennifer 

30
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,180
Hayward notes in her incredible book 
consuming pleasures.

31
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:59,930
The cereal is sort of the perfect form 
for capitalism.

32
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,850
It captures readers with the promise of 
more constantly delaying gratification,

33
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:05,893
and this makes it very commercially 
effective and for the same reasons for 

34
00:02:08,931 --> 00:02:11,210
its appeal to mass market.
Consumers,

35
00:02:11,211 --> 00:02:14,540
cereals have been castigated by critics 
from the jump.

36
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:15,403
Before Dickens became a household name.
High Society reviewers raked his work 

37
00:02:19,701 --> 00:02:20,534
through the mud and the same kind of 
treatment has been meted out on every 

38
00:02:23,181 --> 00:02:25,970
new incarnation of the CEO,
whether it's comics,

39
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,760
the serial films of the forties,
pulp novels,

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,833
soap operas,
or the endless sequels of Hollywood 

41
00:02:32,061 --> 00:02:37,061
blockbusters somewhere in the space.
This may be happening right now,

42
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,593
Star Wars olds.
I think an interesting place in the 

43
00:02:43,971 --> 00:02:44,804
history of the cereal,
a history that began with dickens and 

44
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:48,423
like Dickens,
George Lucas is a special kind of 

45
00:02:51,201 --> 00:02:52,034
visionary going against the grain of 
gritty realistic films that dominated 

46
00:02:55,311 --> 00:02:56,210
the 19 seventies.

47
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,043
Lucas devised a sweeping space epic with
broad themes influenced by the first 

48
00:03:02,681 --> 00:03:05,050
generation of film cereal like Flash 
Gordon's,

49
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:09,310
and he was shrewd enough to understand 
the advantages of serialization.

50
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,920
When it came up to doing the contract 
for the film.

51
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:17,040
I knew that what I really had to do was 
to protect the unwritten part,

52
00:03:17,561 --> 00:03:18,394
the other two parts of the script.
The truth is that all cereals share a 

53
00:03:21,161 --> 00:03:21,994
group of common features and 
characteristics going all the way back 

54
00:03:24,551 --> 00:03:29,110
to the pickwick papers like Dick and 
stories in comic book universes and Star

55
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:29,943
Wars.
Cereals tend to feature giant casts of 

56
00:03:32,141 --> 00:03:32,974
characters and those characters tend to 
resemble the mass public that consumes 

57
00:03:36,371 --> 00:03:37,204
them over time and often far too slowly.
Cereals trend toward diversity and 

58
00:03:42,191 --> 00:03:43,024
because of the massive casts,
cereals also have lots of subplots and 

59
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:47,853
the main plots often feature a 
surprising reversals and twists and 

60
00:03:50,561 --> 00:03:53,860
revelations that keep the audience 
reaching for the next installment,

61
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:54,993
and this can make for cliche and 
hackneyed storytelling like in the case 

62
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:58,624
of soap operas,
which reconstructed the form to the 

63
00:04:00,551 --> 00:04:03,970
point of delaying all conclusions 
infinitely,

64
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:09,630
but even soap operas demonstrate what is
probably the two most important features

65
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:13,320
of cereals,
the creation of interpretive communities

66
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:16,590
and their sensitivity to the audience's 
desires.

67
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:17,963
A lot of the criticism of dickens work 
centered around it's addictive quality 

68
00:04:21,151 --> 00:04:24,150
that the books took their readers out of
everyday life,

69
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,493
but the truth was the opposite.
Cereals created social bonds around the 

70
00:04:29,491 --> 00:04:30,324
content in question acting in this case 
against the alienating effects of 

71
00:04:34,201 --> 00:04:36,240
capitalism and the industrial 
revolution.

72
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:37,403
What's more within this space?
Even the lower classes had a forum for 

73
00:04:41,521 --> 00:04:42,354
engaging in political discourse 
discussing what you thought about bleak 

74
00:04:45,181 --> 00:04:49,020
house or Oliver twist was a way of 
debating social norms.

75
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,390
When the force awakens came out last 
year,

76
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,313
it's emphasis on practical effects and 
tactile imagery was as much a result of 

77
00:04:56,371 --> 00:05:01,371
the audience's referendum on the prequel
films as the expansion of the Sam Weller

78
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,930
character was for Dickens and the 
pickwick papers,

79
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:05,243
but this relaunch of the star wars 
cereals strikes me as something new 

80
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,833
under the sun like soap operas.
It's promising to be endless like the 

81
00:05:13,681 --> 00:05:14,730
marvel film franchise.

82
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,980
It's promising to be connected and 
intertwined,

83
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,263
but unlike most of the comic film,
so many of the stories and characters 

84
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,013
have yet to be written and it's going to
be the first film cereal in which 

85
00:05:24,661 --> 00:05:25,494
subplots are going to be told as 
dedicated features in their own run in 

86
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:33,120
the anthology series.
This means opportunity for audiences.

87
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,223
The so called new golden age of TV is 
almost exclusively down to serialized 

88
00:05:38,181 --> 00:05:41,850
shows that up their game because that's 
what audiences demanded.

89
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,253
The new star wars franchise is primed to
explode in a thousand directions and 

90
00:05:46,711 --> 00:05:47,544
right now at the beginning is when we 
can help to write the rules for what 

91
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:51,624
kind of cereals that we want to see.
A new incarnation of serialization is 

92
00:05:55,651 --> 00:05:56,484
here,
fulfill 180 years after the pickwick 

93
00:05:58,431 --> 00:06:01,850
papers were first published.
That's a long history,

94
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,313
so why not mine it for all the best 
qualities of this resilient and 

95
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,230
receptive Sean.

96
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,120
Hey everybody.
Thanks for watching.

97
00:06:14,121 --> 00:06:17,380
I really want to recommend Jennifer 
Hayward's book consuming pleasures.

98
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:19,400
If you want to know more about the 
history of serialization,

99
00:06:19,401 --> 00:06:22,160
not just the novels but in comics,
and so Barbara's.

100
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,710
It is required reading.
I loved it so much.

101
00:06:24,711 --> 00:06:26,630
So I'll put a link in the description 
below.
