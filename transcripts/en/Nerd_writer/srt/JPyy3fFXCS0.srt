1
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:06,590
Copy on a Tuesday and blog,
14 crosswalk buttons.

2
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:20,060
What do they work?
So contrary to popular belief,

3
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:20,894
people do walk in Los Angeles.
I come across the crosswalk button 

4
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,710
almost everyday.
It usually goes like this.

5
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:26,540
I hit the button,
nothing happens.

6
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,060
Then I hit it repeatedly.
Nothing happens.

7
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,770
Then I hold it down as if to say,
come on.

8
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:34,700
Then something happens and I feel like 
this.

9
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:41,283
I realize I probably just contracted 
leprosy because I've been talking that 

10
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:44,770
filthy buttons.
So what's the deal?

11
00:00:44,771 --> 00:00:45,604
Is it all in my head or am I really most
at this article from the New York Times 

12
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:49,114
in 2004 years?
Well worn push buttons have offered 

13
00:00:51,221 --> 00:00:54,730
harried walkers are rare.
Promise of control over their pedestrian

14
00:00:54,731 --> 00:00:55,780
lives.
First of all,

15
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:56,873
you Michael Lewis

16
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:01,900
studied journalism.
Mass is probably the right adjective.

17
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:06,480
I'm making fun of Novelis.
It turns out the city,

18
00:01:06,481 --> 00:01:08,490
the activated most of it's pedestrian 
buttons longer ago,

19
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,770
more than 2,500
of the 3,250.

20
00:01:10,771 --> 00:01:11,604
What?
Buttons that now exist function 

21
00:01:12,211 --> 00:01:15,360
essentially as mechanical placebos your 
mechanical placebo,

22
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,940
but it's true with the advent of 
computer controlled traffic signals.

23
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:19,970
Crossword buttons have largely been 
deactivated.

24
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:20,813
Major cities.
Traffic is controlled by a centralized 

25
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:22,614
computers executing complex timing pet.
It's how seth green can help Mark 

26
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,590
Wahlberg get places in his mini coop.
But the article is about New York.

27
00:01:28,591 --> 00:01:30,110
What about Los Angeles?
So is it,

28
00:01:30,111 --> 00:01:32,490
is it true that there are certain parts 
of the day in which

29
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:33,910
the,
uh,

30
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,510
the buttons won't affect

31
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,393
the,

32
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:39,970
the light because of the,
because of the,

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,990
because of the complex pattern

34
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:43,123
that I have not heard directly,
but I could imagine that that would be 

35
00:01:46,161 --> 00:01:46,994
the case where there might be certain 
person the day where it's gonna turn 

36
00:01:50,661 --> 00:01:54,950
green on its own timing regardless of 
whether somebody has thought about it or

37
00:01:54,951 --> 00:01:56,120
not.
Because you know,

38
00:01:56,121 --> 00:01:59,220
say if it's rush hour,
they want to get the cars brew.

39
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:01,390
Sure.
So placebos were everywhere,

40
00:02:01,391 --> 00:02:04,890
yet still we press well,
the short answer is humans love.

41
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:06,660
But we've been conditioned all our 
lives.

42
00:02:06,661 --> 00:02:09,010
I believe that buttons do things.
Maybe you should just do it.

43
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:11,763
No,

44
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,333
it's at crosswalks.
We see ourselves pushing the button and 

45
00:02:16,231 --> 00:02:18,710
then we see the little white man cause 
and effect.

46
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,553
Who cares what's happening in between.
We hit the stimulus and get the reward 

47
00:02:21,961 --> 00:02:22,794
that we want.
His tendency is called the illusion of 

48
00:02:24,481 --> 00:02:25,314
control.
It's an idea first developed in 1975 by 

49
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:27,624
ellen langer.
A professor of psychology at Harvard 

50
00:02:29,011 --> 00:02:31,470
says that we overestimate our ability to
control events.

51
00:02:31,471 --> 00:02:33,360
Here's one example in casinos at the 
craps table.

52
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:36,660
It's been shown that people roll harder 
when they want to get higher numbers and

53
00:02:36,661 --> 00:02:38,130
software when they want to get lower 
numbers,

54
00:02:38,131 --> 00:02:42,120
even though dice rolling you,
unless you're George Clooney is a chance

55
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,350
event.
Suzanne Thompson,

56
00:02:43,351 --> 00:02:44,184
professor of Psychology Pomona college 
says that the illusion of control is 

57
00:02:46,501 --> 00:02:47,334
determined by a control your risk 
puristic as an experienced based common 

58
00:02:50,371 --> 00:02:51,204
sense method of problems.
The control heuristic is based on two 

59
00:02:53,671 --> 00:02:54,504
conditions,
the intention to create the outcome and 

60
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:57,200
the relationship between the outcome and
the action.

61
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,300
When I pressed the crosswalk button,
I wanted to chant.

62
00:02:59,301 --> 00:03:00,134
It does change eventually.
That's according to the control here 

63
00:03:01,511 --> 00:03:03,400
ristick my illusion of control.
His strength.

64
00:03:03,401 --> 00:03:04,980
I'm more likely to press it again in the
future.

65
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:08,020
Is this good or bad for me?
You have to decide that for yourself,

66
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,820
consider this even with higher illusions
of control,

67
00:03:09,821 --> 00:03:13,840
are more likely to try new things and 
subsequently do new things in those with

68
00:03:13,841 --> 00:03:16,840
lower loop people who are depressed,
show lower illusions of control and it's

69
00:03:16,841 --> 00:03:19,510
not hard to see why when you consider 
their self worth,

70
00:03:19,511 --> 00:03:20,344
but it has also been shown that people 
with higher illusions of control are 

71
00:03:22,301 --> 00:03:25,030
more likely to commit to failing courses
of action.

72
00:03:25,031 --> 00:03:25,864
It has been argued that a lack of 
illusions is associated with a 

73
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:28,174
non-defensive personality oriented 
toward growth and understanding with a 

74
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:34,150
low ego involvement in outcome.
Now,

75
00:03:34,151 --> 00:03:35,500
I think this point is really important.

76
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,350
First,
let me say that we are Westerners in the

77
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:40,990
tradition of a western philosophy.
It means that we are doers,

78
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,580
actors,
believers in the will,

79
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:43,443
that it can create and change things.
I'm proud of that tradition and growing 

80
00:03:45,821 --> 00:03:46,654
up in it,
I know that I can never totally be a 

81
00:03:47,621 --> 00:03:50,290
part of eastern philosophy,
which is the opposite.

82
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,970
Though I believe that there are things 
we can change.

83
00:03:51,971 --> 00:03:53,820
I also believe that there are things we 
can.

84
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:54,693
One thing we can't change is people,
and maybe that seems like an obvious 

85
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,203
factor,
but I think sometimes we want it so 

86
00:03:59,711 --> 00:04:02,920
badly that we have the illusion that 
it's in our control,

87
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:03,903
so maybe your short,
like 100 percent positive that someone 

88
00:04:05,951 --> 00:04:08,290
you know is going about something wrong.
Well,

89
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:11,830
it takes a non-defensive personality to 
see that it would be wrong to try to get

90
00:04:11,831 --> 00:04:14,290
them to do it right.
It may be a little bit counterintuitive,

91
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:15,940
but telling someone what's right for 
them,

92
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:19,360
thinking that you know what's right for 
them is a way of exercising control,

93
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,130
failed to imagine one another 
complexity,

94
00:04:21,131 --> 00:04:21,964
and in our simplistic view that we can 
handle another's problems better than 

95
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,580
even thinking it's an illusion.
We'd be better off.

96
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,293
Friend dependent will never fully know 
until you let go of the illusion of 

97
00:04:36,571 --> 00:04:37,404
control.

98
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,330
Yeah.
The is the best animated movie.

99
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:01,363
Yeah.
