1
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:10,723
No,

2
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:40,263
you know that voice in your head,
one that tells you right from wrong 

3
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,460
creeps on this time.
No,

4
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:48,050
he has a sleeping disorder.
The Bible,

5
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:51,720
it was buried here with me.
You're here to keep it safe.

6
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:52,863
Him,
not all worlds in on the action you got 

7
00:01:05,741 --> 00:01:10,180
knocked out by a rebel.
Wilson is coming to television.

8
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:11,123
The Edward's brother.
10 singles would do ridiculous things 

9
00:01:13,901 --> 00:01:18,901
for everything.
A teenager again is one tough mother.

10
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:23,920
Spend your time worrying about the worst
case scenario and it actually happens.

11
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:29,190
You've lived it twice.
If you're gay,

12
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:36,030
then how did you and mom have sex?
What's this for?

13
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:05,540
My son died 32 years ago.
Well,

14
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:10,050
there goes a million miles per hour frog
and the blender.
