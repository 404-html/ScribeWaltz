1
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,153
Okay,
so when the final scene of kill bill 

2
00:00:17,331 --> 00:00:18,164
volume two by Quentin Tarantino,
the eponymous villain bill tranquilized 

3
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,013
as the hero and the narrative to deliver
a short monologue on his deep affection 

4
00:00:25,311 --> 00:00:29,270
for comic book Superheroes,
namely Superman Man of steel,

5
00:00:29,271 --> 00:00:31,580
he says,
stands apart from other heroes like that

6
00:00:31,581 --> 00:00:32,270
man,
Spiderman,

7
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:33,440
etc.
In that,

8
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,720
unlike those others who have to don the 
costume,

9
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:36,703
that they may become the hero,
superman wakes as superman and must 

10
00:00:39,891 --> 00:00:40,724
instead down the costume of clark at the
mild mannered reporter from the daily 

11
00:00:43,461 --> 00:00:47,420
planet who bill believes is superman's 
critique on the human race.

12
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,433
Now,
I don't know if tarantino believes this 

13
00:00:49,431 --> 00:00:53,090
or it's just build who does,
but being a huge fan of superman.

14
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:57,920
I have to say that I can't agree with 
this characterization of the last son of

15
00:00:57,921 --> 00:00:58,754
crypto.
Not too long ago when I didn't have to 

16
00:00:59,781 --> 00:01:03,770
pay for rent or utilities or groceries 
or car insurance.

17
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:04,993
I used to read comic books.
Every wednesday I go to the local comic 

18
00:01:07,131 --> 00:01:09,230
book store and pick up new editions of 
the dc monthly.

19
00:01:09,231 --> 00:01:10,064
It's mainly the for superman titles,
which were at that time still running 

20
00:01:12,321 --> 00:01:14,210
action comics,
superman,

21
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,490
the adventures of superman and the man 
of steel.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,780
I was the only one of my friends who who
read comics regularly and so it was sort

23
00:01:20,781 --> 00:01:21,614
of a thrill going there every wednesday 
because it was my first real sense of a 

24
00:01:23,991 --> 00:01:26,750
community in which everyone was 
connected by their love of something.

25
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,160
In this case,
comics,

26
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:31,040
and I've been a huge fan of communities 
like that ever since.

27
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,030
Hence.
Anyway,

28
00:01:32,031 --> 00:01:32,864
I became fascinated with superman 
probably for the same reason that a lot 

29
00:01:35,061 --> 00:01:35,894
of young boys do.
They get lost in that fantasy of 

30
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:38,624
unlimited physical power.
superman could fly and it is an 

31
00:01:41,181 --> 00:01:45,620
immutable fact of the universe that 
every boy everywhere knows exactly which

32
00:01:45,621 --> 00:01:46,454
combination of muscles to clench in 
order to take off into the sky or shoot 

33
00:01:49,761 --> 00:01:51,800
fire from your eyes or see through 
walls.

34
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:53,990
Superman could do all those things.
He could fly at.

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,360
Super speed here,
cries for help at great distances.

36
00:01:56,361 --> 00:02:01,100
He could pick up cars and hurl them like
baseballs and how cruel where the stupid

37
00:02:01,101 --> 00:02:01,934
stupid laws of physics for preventing 
all this regular humans from doing such 

38
00:02:05,271 --> 00:02:06,104
things when it's so easy to imagine.
I don't think that those fantasies ever 

39
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,060
leave us,
but as I grew older,

40
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:14,330
the story of superman began to captivate
me for different reasons.

41
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,253
I think when we're young,
we feel that to achieve those feats of 

42
00:02:17,151 --> 00:02:18,800
strength would solve a lot of our 
problems.

43
00:02:18,801 --> 00:02:21,560
If I could only fly,
if I can be the one who flies,

44
00:02:21,561 --> 00:02:24,830
then I could be special and important 
and all those abstract things.

45
00:02:24,831 --> 00:02:26,420
But as we make our way through 
adolescence,

46
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,470
the complexities of the inner life begin
to muddy those waters.

47
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,810
The pen with which you have to write 
your own identity,

48
00:02:32,811 --> 00:02:33,644
gets put into your hand and you realize 
that no feat of strength or speed will 

49
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,070
help you with that task or superman.

50
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:42,020
The tasks would be even more difficult.
His strength,

51
00:02:42,021 --> 00:02:43,700
his speed,
his ability to fly,

52
00:02:43,701 --> 00:02:44,534
serve only to neutralize the physical so
that the intellectual and emotional 

53
00:02:47,961 --> 00:02:49,940
problems that plague all of us.
how to love,

54
00:02:49,941 --> 00:02:51,920
how to be loved,
how to know who we are,

55
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:53,540
what we should want,
how we should act,

56
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:56,210
why we're here,
appear only in starker relief.

57
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,310
All his incredible power becomes an 
equally helplessness.

58
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,173
Clark can't,
can't wake up fried from these things 

59
00:03:02,861 --> 00:03:03,694
just as neither you nor I can ignore the
personal and ethical dilemmas that 

60
00:03:06,851 --> 00:03:09,370
define us and it's ironic that in the 
comics,

61
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:10,483
his feelings of being an alien from 
another planet of not fitting in or the 

62
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:13,984
cause of so much sorrow because it has 
these same feelings of sorrow for not 

63
00:03:17,171 --> 00:03:18,340
fitting in,
for not belonging,

64
00:03:18,341 --> 00:03:22,060
that make the rest of us human.
Clark kent is clark kent.

65
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:27,240
He puts on the costume to become 
superman and his as godly and perfect as

66
00:03:27,311 --> 00:03:29,170
we would have others believe that we 
are.

67
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:32,350
He saves the world from extraterrestrial
existential threats,

68
00:03:32,351 --> 00:03:34,840
from villains of every shape,
size and hairstyle.

69
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:37,780
Good.
He is as impotent as the rest of us when

70
00:03:37,781 --> 00:03:38,614
it comes to saving himself from the 
bumbling stuttering forever struggling 

71
00:03:41,711 --> 00:03:42,544
condition of life and maybe clark kent 
is clark kent's critique on the human 

72
00:03:46,241 --> 00:03:48,370
race,
but to say that is simply to say that we

73
00:03:48,371 --> 00:03:51,070
are all continuously critiquing the 
human race.

74
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,570
When we,
for example,

75
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,553
make total fools of ourselves in front 
of the lowest lanes of our lines and as 

76
00:03:58,481 --> 00:03:59,314
beautiful as lois seems to clark,
we know that she herself feels 

77
00:04:04,301 --> 00:04:09,301
inadequate and the presence of superman,
the great hero who is after all,

78
00:04:09,701 --> 00:04:12,850
only the same clark kent,
who's invincible knees,

79
00:04:12,851 --> 00:04:16,840
can't seem to keep from going week in 
the presence of her kryptonite eyes.

80
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:18,813
Some critique.
