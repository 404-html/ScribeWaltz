1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,021
Okay,
okay.

2
00:00:01,021 --> 00:00:02,010
Okay.
Okay.

3
00:00:02,011 --> 00:00:03,090
Okay.
Okay.

4
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,120
Coffee on a Tuesday and Vlog 38.

5
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:16,960
Okay.

6
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:20,560
Laziness.
Being unwilling to use work or energy.

7
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:23,620
A lazy person sometimes called slacker 
couch potato.

8
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:25,420
Nerdwriter bludger.
Wait,

9
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:26,110
no,
that's wrong.

10
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:30,910
Blood sugar is the furthest thing from 
laziness is dead serious.

11
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:36,340
What the hell?
I consider laziness to be the LEX luthor

12
00:00:36,341 --> 00:00:38,200
of my life.
Which begs the question,

13
00:00:38,201 --> 00:00:39,034
was kryptonite really the weakness of 
superman or was it lex luther or was it 

14
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:45,160
love Ludovic?
Van misstates,

15
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:46,023
the Austrian economist wrote the 
expenditure of labor is deemed painful 

16
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:53,440
not to work is considered a state of 
affairs more satisfactory than working.

17
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,303
Leisure is other things being equal.
I prefer to travail people work only 

18
00:00:57,521 --> 00:01:02,080
when they value the return of labor 
higher than the decrease in satisfaction

19
00:01:02,081 --> 00:01:04,330
brought about by the curtailment of 
leisure.

20
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,500
Is that true?
I mean,

21
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:06,483
I remember those days in college when I 
had a long paper test to finish and I 

22
00:01:10,031 --> 00:01:11,830
thought to myself,
if I just finished this,

23
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:16,330
I'll have three or four days where I 
won't have to do anything and it will be

24
00:01:16,331 --> 00:01:19,090
glorious.
I was living for the gaps as it were,

25
00:01:19,091 --> 00:01:23,560
those times when I could just be lazy 
and even now having worked at a real job

26
00:01:23,561 --> 00:01:24,394
for some time,
I'm beginning to learn the meaning of 

27
00:01:25,601 --> 00:01:27,400
that classic Loverboy Song.

28
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,660
Don't get me wrong,
I have a great job,

29
00:01:31,661 --> 00:01:32,494
but it's still work and there are times 
when I find myself daydreaming about my 

30
00:01:35,801 --> 00:01:37,990
couch,
my boxers,

31
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:39,543
Jersey shore.
I've always felt like this laziness 

32
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,393
wasn't me,
like it was some disease I had 

33
00:01:44,081 --> 00:01:46,600
contracted,
like my bad work ethic was the result of

34
00:01:46,601 --> 00:01:49,630
being spoiled as a kid or the coddling 
of contemporary society.

35
00:01:49,631 --> 00:01:51,910
I felt this way because I couldn't 
change it.

36
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:52,744
I couldn't excise it from myself.
All I had was my fear of failure to 

37
00:01:56,471 --> 00:01:58,180
fight it,
and when you graduate from school,

38
00:01:58,181 --> 00:02:00,220
when the educational system spits you 
out,

39
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,280
it dawns on you that if you don't make 
money,

40
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:04,923
you're going to become homeless.
Of course you might be lucky enough to 

41
00:02:07,301 --> 00:02:08,800
have parents to help you out part of the
way,

42
00:02:08,801 --> 00:02:11,200
but unless you're inheriting a large 
fortune,

43
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,090
you're going to have to figure it out 
for yourself.

44
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,400
At that point,
you can still use the fear of failure to

45
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:17,830
guide you or you can use the 
disappointment of others,

46
00:02:17,831 --> 00:02:18,664
or you can find something that you 
really love that doesn't seem like work 

47
00:02:21,131 --> 00:02:21,964
at all.
Never underestimate the power of not 

48
00:02:23,681 --> 00:02:24,514
wanting to disappoint your mother.
Hard work is considered by almost 

49
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:31,090
everyone a virtue,
but laziness may in fact be our nature.

50
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,073
A lot of animals are just lazy.
They only get what they need and they 

51
00:02:34,091 --> 00:02:35,610
just lounge around for the rest of the 
time,

52
00:02:35,611 --> 00:02:39,070
but theories abound which give Leisure 
and laziness more credit.

53
00:02:39,071 --> 00:02:41,170
For example,
in ecclesiastics 14,

54
00:02:41,171 --> 00:02:42,004
it says,
wisdom is good together with an 

55
00:02:43,271 --> 00:02:44,104
inheritance or Schopenhauer,
the man to whom nature and fate have 

56
00:02:46,391 --> 00:02:47,224
granted the blessing of wisdom will be 
most anxious and careful to keep open 

57
00:02:50,591 --> 00:02:55,591
the fountains of happiness which he has 
in himself and for this independence and

58
00:02:55,601 --> 00:02:56,434
leisure,
or necessarily the point is that 

59
00:02:57,851 --> 00:02:58,684
leisure,
those hours when don't have to work for 

60
00:03:00,251 --> 00:03:03,370
our bread may be the best for 
inspiration.

61
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,010
In fact,
the modern economy echoes that sentiment

62
00:03:06,011 --> 00:03:07,480
somewhat.
The virtuous phrase,

63
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:12,570
work hard has almost totally been 
replaced with worksmart or work uniquely

64
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,220
many like those in the web development 
community.

65
00:03:15,221 --> 00:03:18,160
Use Leisure to their business advantage.
Be sure the terms,

66
00:03:18,161 --> 00:03:20,800
Leisure and laziness have nuances of 
their own.

67
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:21,634
Suffice it to say that complete laziness
won't sustain and total leisure doesn't 

68
00:03:25,901 --> 00:03:29,620
exist in the realm of practical life.
It comes down to a dualistic mantra.

69
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:31,900
Be Happy,
make money,

70
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:35,003
avoid.

71
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,100
Okay,
daily grace.

72
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:41,500
We both know you're getting my tweets to
collaborate,

73
00:03:41,501 --> 00:03:42,334
so what I'm going to do now is enlist 
all the viewers watching this video to 

74
00:03:44,831 --> 00:03:47,350
tweet daily grace to collaborate with 
the nerdwriter.

75
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:48,370
Why?
Well,

76
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:49,203
because I'm handsome because I'm 
charming because I'm well at the moment 

77
00:03:52,601 --> 00:03:53,434
I'm Gassy,
but I don't consider that powerhouse in 

78
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:57,550
the kitchen.
Mediocre at basketball,

79
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:01,420
the most sonorous high fives you've ever
received.

80
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:05,350
I have a heart of gold and I desperately
need surgery.

81
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:08,680
I've been known to give massages.
No,

82
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,480
no,
that's wrong.

83
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,830
I.
I like massage.

84
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,710
Can you give me a massage?
