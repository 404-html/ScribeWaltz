1
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:06,243
I can't quite believe that three years 
ago I began my life as a youtuber with 

2
00:00:11,141 --> 00:00:14,820
this video explaining that I had become 
disillusioned with filmmaking,

3
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:17,890
my major at school,
and wanted to become a novelist.

4
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:21,040
The plan back then was to follow the 
example of John Green,

5
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:24,670
who is just then finishing the fault in 
our stars because morning it's Monday.

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,450
The vlogs purpose was to find an 
audience for a novel I had written while

7
00:00:28,451 --> 00:00:31,540
living in Paris and hoped at some point 
to publish.

8
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,850
A couple of weeks later,
I came up with the name.

9
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:34,713
Here's my thinking.
I'm an editor and a writer and they're 

10
00:00:37,841 --> 00:00:40,210
fighting writer,
a nerd writer these days.

11
00:00:40,211 --> 00:00:41,044
Youtube is like the wild west of media,
and even the ones who've made it can't 

12
00:00:44,351 --> 00:00:48,790
quite conceive of their profession 
because whenever they started doing what

13
00:00:48,791 --> 00:00:50,650
they're doing,
it didn't exist.

14
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:52,840
At least that's been the experience for 
me.

15
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,570
Early on.
I knew that what I was doing here as the

16
00:00:55,571 --> 00:00:56,404
nerd writer was more exciting and 
fulfilling than any other work in my 

17
00:00:58,901 --> 00:01:02,010
life,
but exactly what it was alluded.

18
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:04,240
So today,
now,

19
00:01:04,241 --> 00:01:05,074
three years later,
I want to update the mission statement 

20
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:08,283
of this project.
What we do here besides talk with our 

21
00:01:10,721 --> 00:01:13,690
hands a lot,
is cultivate worldview.

22
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,150
I think those two words sum it up 
nicely.

23
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,440
Worldview is,
as you know,

24
00:01:17,441 --> 00:01:18,274
a particular philosophy of life.
It implies the entirety of what we 

25
00:01:21,371 --> 00:01:24,190
comprehend and believe about the world,
about ourselves,

26
00:01:24,191 --> 00:01:28,150
about how each interacts with the other.
It suggests a commitment,

27
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:30,940
a modest one to the well rounded 
individual,

28
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:35,830
the intellectual life we at the nerd 
writer are men and women of letters.

29
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:39,520
As Taran said,
nothing human is foreign to us.

30
00:01:39,521 --> 00:01:42,370
We recognize that life is philosophical,
moral,

31
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:43,930
political,
financial,

32
00:01:43,931 --> 00:01:45,160
psychological,
artistic,

33
00:01:45,161 --> 00:01:45,994
scientific,
and that what is worth knowing is worth 

34
00:01:47,771 --> 00:01:51,160
weaving into a complex and comprehensive
web.

35
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:52,023
That's what goes on here at the nerd 
writer and it's a process that takes 

36
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,593
time.
I researched right film and edit this 

37
00:01:57,041 --> 00:02:01,240
project by myself and the free time I 
have after working a full time day job,

38
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:05,590
but my dream is to do this with you full
time.

39
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:06,453
I've set up an account on Patrion.com
and today I'm asking for your help to 

40
00:02:09,761 --> 00:02:12,220
keep this project going.
If you don't know what Patrion is,

41
00:02:12,221 --> 00:02:16,660
it's a really cool way for fans to 
become patrons of the content they love.

42
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:19,990
The way it works is like this.
When you become a patron of an artist,

43
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,090
you're agreeing to give that artist a 
tip.

44
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,400
Every time they release a piece of 
content.

45
00:02:24,401 --> 00:02:25,234
For the nerd writer,
what you can expect is three to four 

46
00:02:26,921 --> 00:02:29,260
videos a month,
maximum four,

47
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:30,123
so if you pledge $1,
say that means you're going to be 

48
00:02:32,111 --> 00:02:35,050
spending somewhere between three to $4 a
month.

49
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:38,920
It's important to note that the nerd 
writer will always be free.

50
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:39,783
You will always be able to access this 
channel and the videos here without 

51
00:02:43,241 --> 00:02:44,074
charge.
This is just for people who have the 

52
00:02:45,341 --> 00:02:48,130
ability and the desire to help support 
this channel.

53
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,220
I don't want anyone stretching their 
budgets if they can't afford it.

54
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,143
For those of you who donate $1,
you'll get a text mention at the end of 

55
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:58,180
all my following videos.
For those of you who donate $3,

56
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:02,920
you'll get a personal type written poem 
by me sent to your house.

57
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,910
For those of you who donate $5,
and this is by far my favorite.

58
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:07,773
You can get a limited edition nerd 
writer Mug at matches the Mug logo at 

59
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:14,980
the beginning of my videos or other perk
ideas.

60
00:03:14,981 --> 00:03:16,540
I want to know what you think they're 
for you.

61
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:17,374
So I think she'd probably have a say in 
what they are giving me suggestions in 

62
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,273
the comments here at the nerd writer.
We think and speak critically 

63
00:03:24,611 --> 00:03:27,010
dispassionately,
precisely as we can.

64
00:03:27,011 --> 00:03:30,250
We try to see the world and ourselves 
for what they are.

65
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:31,084
We try to think about how we would like 
them to be and why it is we would like 

66
00:03:34,241 --> 00:03:35,074
them to be that way and we think about 
thinking to hear we cultivate worldview 

67
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:43,330
and have had a fucking good time doing 
it.

68
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:47,290
So thank you.
And coffee on a Tuesday.
