1
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:03,370
I was totally against the war in Iraq 
from a.

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:07,990
You can look at esquire magazine from 
[inaudible] you can look at before that,

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,153
and I was against the war in Iraq,
so you're moderating a forum with a 

4
00:00:12,071 --> 00:00:12,904
candidate for president of the United 
States and you get hit with a couple of 

5
00:00:15,251 --> 00:00:19,180
statements that are presented as truth.
The crux of the answer is that he,

6
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:20,043
Donald Trump,
never supported the invasion of Iraq in 

7
00:00:21,911 --> 00:00:25,090
2003.
This part you can check pretty easily.

8
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,313
Trump's referring to this article in 
which he doesn't so much explicitly 

9
00:00:28,931 --> 00:00:29,764
state his opposition to the war as say 
what a mess it is and that he would 

10
00:00:32,381 --> 00:00:34,330
never have handled it that way.
Also,

11
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:38,020
trump's repeated claim is that he 
opposed the war from the beginning,

12
00:00:38,021 --> 00:00:38,854
which was a year before.
This article was published in August 

13
00:00:41,081 --> 00:00:43,030
2004 right at the moment,
by the way,

14
00:00:43,031 --> 00:00:46,510
when public opinion was changing on the 
war from positive to negative.

15
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,673
In fact,
esquire felt so strongly that trump had 

16
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,460
misrepresented his position in the 
piece,

17
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:54,010
particularly in this major foreign 
policy speech.

18
00:00:54,011 --> 00:00:54,844
From August.
I was an opponent of the Iraq war from 

19
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:02,740
the beginning that they added an 
editor's no correcting him at the top of

20
00:01:02,741 --> 00:01:03,574
the article.
Being a well informed and prepared 

21
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:05,764
moderator,
you would of course know all these 

22
00:01:06,821 --> 00:01:08,620
things that trump's opposition to the 
war,

23
00:01:08,621 --> 00:01:12,730
a cornerstone of his foreign policy 
credentials is questionable at best,

24
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,793
and you would also know this,
which was set on the same stage to you 

25
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:19,990
less than an hour before.
Now my opponent was for the war in Iraq.

26
00:01:19,991 --> 00:01:21,550
He says he wasn't.
You can,

27
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:24,160
you can go back and look at the record.
He supported.

28
00:01:24,161 --> 00:01:27,310
He told Howard stern he supported it.
Are you for invading Iraq?

29
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,710
Yeah,
I guess so.

30
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:33,850
So now's your chance to push back on a 
statement that you know is a lie,

31
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:34,773
a lie about an issue that was decisive 
in Hillary Clinton's defeat by Barack 

32
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,080
Obama in 2008 ally.

33
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:42,310
This candidate used to separate himself 
from his primary opponents.

34
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:46,750
Just a fucking why.
Correcting that sort of deceit is what a

35
00:01:46,751 --> 00:01:50,810
journalist is trained to do for.
You could just move on.

36
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:54,590
People talk about you and commander in 
chief and not just secretary Clinton,

37
00:01:54,591 --> 00:01:57,230
but some of your Republican opponents in
the primary season.

38
00:01:57,231 --> 00:01:58,064
Then they wonder about your temp.
We shouldn't be too harsh on Matt Lauer 

39
00:02:00,681 --> 00:02:01,514
alone.
Fact checking in the 2016 election has 

40
00:02:02,931 --> 00:02:03,764
proven to be a Gargantuan and uniquely 
difficult task in the face of two 

41
00:02:07,071 --> 00:02:09,710
candidates with shaky relationships to 
the truth.

42
00:02:09,711 --> 00:02:10,544
I mean there are no shortage of clip 
compilations on Youtube Showing Hillary 

43
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,860
Clinton being less than honest.
Just a few weeks ago,

44
00:02:15,861 --> 00:02:17,030
for example,
she said,

45
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:21,590
I'm the only candidate who ran an either
the democratic or the Republican primary

46
00:02:21,591 --> 00:02:22,424
who said from the very beginning,
I will not raise taxes on the middle 

47
00:02:26,091 --> 00:02:26,810
class,
which

48
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:27,643
is kind of odd considering that 15 out 
of 17 gop candidates for president 

49
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,000
actually signed a written pledge 
agreeing to no tax likes,

50
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:37,520
not just on the middle class on 
everyone.

51
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:40,760
I found that live pretty easily with the
help of politifact.com,

52
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:43,700
one of the largest online fact checking 
sites in the world,

53
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:44,863
and the Internet has been at the 
forefront of dedicated fact checking 

54
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:48,374
operation since the early 2000 in 2016.
The Duke reporters' lab found 96 active 

55
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:54,483
checking projects in 37 different 
countries and these organizations do 

56
00:02:58,071 --> 00:03:01,870
great work,
dubious political statements and judging

57
00:03:01,871 --> 00:03:06,800
their accuracy on nuanced rating scales,
but there was one problem,

58
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,370
Mr Trump.
Let's stay on this issue of immigration.

59
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:13,050
You have been very critical of Mark 
Zuckerberg of facebook who is wanting to

60
00:03:13,051 --> 00:03:16,500
increase the number of these.
H One is not at all critical of him.

61
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,610
Where did I read this and come up with 
this that you were to league?

62
00:03:19,611 --> 00:03:21,660
I don't know.
Your people write this stuff.

63
00:03:21,661 --> 00:03:22,494
I don't know.

64
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,040
The problem is that television is still 
the number one source of information for

65
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:28,874
American voters and on television.
Politicians who lie often get a free 

66
00:03:32,901 --> 00:03:33,860
pass.
In the clip,

67
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:37,220
we just saw that moderator went on to 
apologize for her mistake.

68
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,293
That's pretty unbelievable considering 
that the article she mentioned with 

69
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:43,940
trump's criticism of mark Zuckerberg not
only existed,

70
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:48,560
it existed on trump's home website,
that's unpreparedness to the extreme,

71
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:49,483
but it goes further than that because 
even when you are aggressive and 

72
00:03:51,891 --> 00:03:52,724
prepared,
trump has a way of wriggling out of the 

73
00:03:54,951 --> 00:03:55,784
truth.
Like when he lied and said that he saw 

74
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,990
Arabs cheering in Jersey City on nine 
slash 11,

75
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:00,720
you know,
the police

76
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,553
say that didn't happen at all.
Those rumors have been on the Internet 

77
00:04:03,691 --> 00:04:06,110
for some time.
So did you meet Mr Yesterday?

78
00:04:06,111 --> 00:04:08,610
I saw it.
Was that with your own eyes,

79
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,953
George,
we didn't have a people that were 

80
00:04:11,221 --> 00:04:12,054
cheering and the other side of New 
Jersey where you have large Arab 

81
00:04:14,941 --> 00:04:15,774
populations,
they were cheering is the world trade 

82
00:04:17,671 --> 00:04:18,504
center came down.

83
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:21,520
We have three extremely important 
presidential debates coming up.

84
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:22,413
Those moderators have a huge task taking
on candidates as shameless as trump and 

85
00:04:26,591 --> 00:04:27,424
as calculated as Clinton,
but their focus should be on the 

86
00:04:30,641 --> 00:04:35,200
audience and on what works and what 
works on TV is imagery,

87
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,400
graphics.
I mean,

88
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:40,600
one of the most effective fat checks 
this election season was by Fox News,

89
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,940
who not only called trump out on his 
lies,

90
00:04:42,941 --> 00:04:47,080
but projected the actual facts onto the 
screen for the audience to see

91
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:49,040
your numbers don't add up.

92
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:53,240
The second thing networks should do is 
fact check in real time on Chiron's,

93
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,640
as was pointed out to me by master fact 
checkers,

94
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:58,100
Alexios [inaudible] lease over at the 
poynter institute,

95
00:04:58,101 --> 00:05:02,210
CNN experimented with fact checking 
Chiron's earlier this election season.

96
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,460
Now,
it's unclear if it was a mistake,

97
00:05:04,461 --> 00:05:06,950
but for God's sake,
it was awesome.

98
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,143
A huge problem with lies on TV news is 
that they tend to be repeated or shown 

99
00:05:11,151 --> 00:05:13,670
without any clear indication that 
they're false.

100
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:14,773
In fact,
I did that at the beginning of this 

101
00:05:16,101 --> 00:05:16,934
video in 2012.
The new America Foundation found that 

102
00:05:19,011 --> 00:05:19,844
the more familiar a claim becomes,
the more likely we are to think it's 

103
00:05:23,001 --> 00:05:25,790
true even after we've heard a 
correction.

104
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:29,360
So instead of that completely stupid 
audience reaction,

105
00:05:29,361 --> 00:05:30,194
oh,
meter networks carrying the debates 

106
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:35,900
could throw up a Kyron that refutes 
patently false claims in real time.

107
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,700
TV networks,
by and large,

108
00:05:37,701 --> 00:05:38,534
have steered clear of these measures,
perhaps out of some vague notion of 

109
00:05:41,211 --> 00:05:42,044
neutrality.
One debate moderator has already said 

110
00:05:43,521 --> 00:05:46,790
that he doesn't feel like it's his job 
to be a truth squad.

111
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:51,320
What do you do if the they make 
assertions that you know to be untrue?

112
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:54,110
That's not my job.
That's how I do not believe that it's my

113
00:05:54,111 --> 00:05:55,790
job to be a truth squad.
What

114
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:56,803
are news,
if not truth squads free people the 

115
00:06:00,771 --> 00:06:01,604
world over still care about facts,
and we look to our news media to sort 

116
00:06:05,571 --> 00:06:10,571
through bullshit and lies to find them.
The fact is that neutrality doesn't mean

117
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:11,683
equivalency.
Hillary Clinton lies more than she 

118
00:06:13,851 --> 00:06:14,684
should,
and it's important for fact checkers to 

119
00:06:15,771 --> 00:06:17,900
call her and every other politician on 
it.

120
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,940
You talk about leveling with the 
American people.

121
00:06:19,941 --> 00:06:23,280
Have you always told the truth?
I've always tried to always,

122
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:24,523
always.
Some people are going to call that 

123
00:06:27,381 --> 00:06:29,780
wiggle room,
but let's be honest,

124
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,230
Donald Trump exists in a totally 
different category.

125
00:06:33,231 --> 00:06:36,430
Lies and bullshit are his political 
currency.

126
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:39,250
What do I know about it?
All I know is what's on the Internet.

127
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,590
You may not be able to get through to 
Donald Trump,

128
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:45,310
but good journalism can get through to 
the rest of us,

129
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:49,420
so if you get a chance to speak to any 
of our leaders in a public forum,

130
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,880
make sure you're well prepared and 
aggressive,

131
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:55,030
and if you understand what the facts 
are,

132
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:56,823
let us know.

133
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,910
There is a new nerve read video every 
Wednesday,

134
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:06,630
so if you go right there and click that,
you'll subscribe to this channel and get

135
00:07:06,631 --> 00:07:07,464
all the videos.
I really have to thank Alexios 

136
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,270
[inaudible],
who is the director of the international

137
00:07:12,271 --> 00:07:13,104
fact checking network at the poynter 
institute who collaborated with me on 

138
00:07:16,021 --> 00:07:19,650
this project and whose work has been 
invaluable and the research of it.

139
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,633
I'm going to put everything he's ever 
written on this in the description 

140
00:07:22,381 --> 00:07:24,420
below.
It's all really great stuff.

141
00:07:24,421 --> 00:07:25,254
You should definitely check it out.
I'm going to put his twitter handle 

142
00:07:26,461 --> 00:07:28,440
right below me too.
Thank you very much,

143
00:07:28,441 --> 00:07:30,150
Alexios.
You're awesome.

144
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,400
Anyway,
I'll see you guys next Wednesday.
