1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,640
Alright baby,
let's do this thing.

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:04,980
Coffee on a Tuesday and block 39,

3
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,083
so I know it's not good to talk about 
politics or religion in polite 

4
00:00:19,941 --> 00:00:22,910
conversation,
but flame wars be damned.

5
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:23,803
I'm doing it.
I had quite a wonderful time last 

6
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,610
Thursday watching the vice presidential 
debate.

7
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,890
It was a hoot and holler and stripped to
the waist,

8
00:00:30,891 --> 00:00:33,080
bare knuckle boxing match,
twix,

9
00:00:33,081 --> 00:00:33,914
Joey Mac and the spell poindexter.
The debate range from Libya to Iran to 

10
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:38,804
Medicare to taxes to abortion and Martha
Raddatz was wonderful indeed and though 

11
00:00:42,531 --> 00:00:44,900
she held the debate by the scruff of its
neck,

12
00:00:44,901 --> 00:00:45,734
she was not opposed to letting the 
opponents slug it out when it came to 

13
00:00:48,231 --> 00:00:51,800
blows because that's what they went 
there to do.

14
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:52,663
That's democracy.
Let's take a look at one exchange that 

15
00:00:54,891 --> 00:00:55,530
interested me.

16
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,270
I am.
I'm not allowed to show letters,

17
00:00:57,271 --> 00:01:00,090
but go on our website.
He sent me two letters saying,

18
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,103
by the way,
can you send me some stimulus money for 

19
00:01:03,961 --> 00:01:06,360
companies here in the State of 
Wisconsin?

20
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:07,343
We sent millions of dollars.
You know why he said it asked for 

21
00:01:09,781 --> 00:01:11,510
stimulus.
By the way,

22
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,080
on two occasions we,
we,

23
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,110
we advocated for

24
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:16,000
constituents who are applying for grants
now,

25
00:01:16,001 --> 00:01:16,834
Ryan and the Romney,
Ryan ticket and the House Republican 

26
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:20,733
Caucus and Senate Republicans and 
Republicans generally have spent a lot 

27
00:01:22,751 --> 00:01:27,751
of time decrying the efficacy of the 
recovery act called by many the stimulus

28
00:01:27,971 --> 00:01:29,950
package.
They spend a lot of time saying how this

29
00:01:29,951 --> 00:01:31,360
didn't work,
how it failed,

30
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:32,373
and they're repetitive.
Persistence in this matter has worked 

31
00:01:34,181 --> 00:01:36,640
out pretty well for them considering 
that this huge,

32
00:01:36,641 --> 00:01:37,474
some would say signature piece of 
legislation from the Obama 

33
00:01:39,101 --> 00:01:43,300
administration is barely ever talked 
about by the administration itself,

34
00:01:43,301 --> 00:01:44,134
but as the exchange showed spelled 
poindexters own requests for stimulus 

35
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:48,124
funds for his state seems to contradict 
his party's assertion that the stimulus 

36
00:01:51,281 --> 00:01:53,200
did nothing for small businesses.
In fact,

37
00:01:53,201 --> 00:01:54,034
the stimulus achieved a whole host of 
things including getting a two drowning 

38
00:01:56,951 --> 00:01:57,784
states tax cuts for middle income 
Americans grants for schools based on 

39
00:02:00,611 --> 00:02:02,840
performance.
It paved the way for a smart grid.

40
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,530
It accelerated the process of digitizing
health records.

41
00:02:05,531 --> 00:02:06,364
It's spent money on homelessness.
Prevention on infrastructure upgraded 

42
00:02:08,861 --> 00:02:12,430
236 miles of flood control levees,
350 military base,

43
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:17,290
850 wastewater systems and 400,000
public housing apartments.

44
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,153
It helped bring broadband internet too 
far out communities and it invested in 

45
00:02:21,521 --> 00:02:23,650
future technologies and fledgling 
industries.

46
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:24,693
An example of both is green energy now.
This in particular has Paul Ryan in a 

47
00:02:28,961 --> 00:02:29,794
tizzy $90,000,000,000
in green pork to campaign contributors 

48
00:02:32,921 --> 00:02:36,850
and special interest groups like he 
himself urge Labor Secretary Hilda Solis

49
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:39,940
to fund a green jobs training program in
Wisconsin.

50
00:02:39,941 --> 00:02:40,774
Green energy is a special favorite of 
mine when it comes to the recovery act 

51
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:45,340
because at the end of the Bush 
administration,

52
00:02:45,341 --> 00:02:47,830
that sector was on the edge about to 
die.

53
00:02:47,831 --> 00:02:49,540
Solar companies,
wind companies,

54
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:50,374
biofuel companies,
we're ready to move their businesses to 

55
00:02:51,881 --> 00:02:55,270
other places in the world because in 
America the money just wasn't there.

56
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:57,340
In just the decade before Obama took 
office,

57
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:02,520
our share in global solar production and
deployment fell from 40 percent to eight

58
00:03:03,161 --> 00:03:03,994
percent.
The recovery acts investment in Green 

59
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,633
Tech is a great example of how a 
government should seek to affect change 

60
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,070
without the billions of dollars in 
grants from the stimulus.

61
00:03:12,071 --> 00:03:15,910
Green energy companies were dead in the 
water compared to dirty energy.

62
00:03:15,911 --> 00:03:16,744
Companies whose costs from huge scale 
allowed them to produce at a much 

63
00:03:19,721 --> 00:03:23,440
cheaper and more competitive rate,
not to mention the billions in subsidies

64
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,440
dirty was and is getting from the 
government already.

65
00:03:26,441 --> 00:03:29,560
Green Tech needed help to bridge what's 
called the valley of death.

66
00:03:29,561 --> 00:03:32,710
That period of time for startups when 
they acquire lots of debt,

67
00:03:32,711 --> 00:03:33,544
building their product and achieving the
economies of scale necessary to make 

68
00:03:36,701 --> 00:03:39,610
that business profitable.
Green Tech was dying because each of its

69
00:03:39,611 --> 00:03:40,444
various technologies was too young or 
too risky for private investors who 

70
00:03:45,251 --> 00:03:46,930
could make easier money on other things.

71
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:50,650
Some will tell you that government 
investment like the $90,000,000,000,

72
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,573
that green tech guide in the stimulus 
package is bad because it crowds out 

73
00:03:54,731 --> 00:03:55,564
private investment in 2009 at the height
of the recession when capital money was 

74
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,250
nowhere.
The crowding out argument doesn't really

75
00:04:03,251 --> 00:04:04,084
hold water.
The recovery act actually crowded in 

76
00:04:06,161 --> 00:04:08,240
private investment by helping new 
technologies,

77
00:04:08,241 --> 00:04:08,921
solar,
wind,

78
00:04:08,921 --> 00:04:10,780
battery,
biofuel bridge,

79
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:14,140
the valley of death,
making the opportunity sexier.

80
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,003
Solar was dying.
Now it's one of the fastest growing 

81
00:04:17,771 --> 00:04:18,604
industries in the country and if we just
take a look at Romney's old five point 

82
00:04:22,481 --> 00:04:23,330
plan here,
we'll see.

83
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:25,443
Oh yes.
Second we'll give our fellow citizens 

84
00:04:27,071 --> 00:04:30,300
the skills they need for the jobs of 
today and the careers are tomorrow.

85
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,173
Jobs of tomorrow check.
So if you wanna learn more about the 

86
00:04:37,751 --> 00:04:39,250
recovery act,
I highly,

87
00:04:39,251 --> 00:04:40,084
highly,
highly recommend you read Michael 

88
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,440
Grunwald new book,
the new new deal.

89
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,560
It should be required reading for anyone
who is going to vote next month.

90
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,210
It's got pictures in it to look.
Look,

91
00:04:52,211 --> 00:04:53,044
look,
it's Joe Biden and President Obama were 

92
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,410
just hanging out,
hanging out.

93
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:57,423
But.
