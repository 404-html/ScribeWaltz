1
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:10,950
We have people coming into our country 
that are looking to do tremendous harm.

2
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,360
Exactly.
One year ago today,

3
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:17,620
I did my best to explore the way Donald 
Trump answers a question.

4
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:18,783
His use of language in speech I thought 
was fascinating and unique and 

5
00:00:21,821 --> 00:00:22,654
illuminated.
Why he's so successful at selling a 

6
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:28,540
feeling now that trump has been 
president elect for 50 days.

7
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,140
We don't get to hear much of trump's 
speech anymore.

8
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:33,063
His interview appearances are dwindling 
and his press conferences or 

9
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:36,523
nonexistent,
but that doesn't mean he stopped using 

10
00:00:38,441 --> 00:00:39,274
and manipulating language these days.
The language that trump puts on the 

11
00:00:42,311 --> 00:00:45,400
public record and comes largely from 
writing,

12
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:50,550
specifically from writing on twitter in 
140 character notes as of December 29th,

13
00:00:51,521 --> 00:00:52,354
2016,
trump has tweeted 221 times as the 

14
00:00:55,331 --> 00:00:56,164
president elect.
It's important to note at the outset 

15
00:00:57,701 --> 00:01:00,250
that these tweets come largely from a 
few sources.

16
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:01,810
Thanks to info from the metadata.

17
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:02,643
We know that of the 221,
153 or 69 percent come from an android 

18
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:11,500
phone.
Trump's personal samsung galaxy 59 or 27

19
00:01:11,501 --> 00:01:12,334
percent come from an iphone and nine or 
four percent come from the twitter web 

20
00:01:15,981 --> 00:01:19,000
client as in someone typing the tweets 
into a computer.

21
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:19,863
A number of commentators and data 
analysts have surmised that the iphone 

22
00:01:22,241 --> 00:01:26,200
tweets are not written by trump himself,
but by his staff.

23
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:30,100
I think that's almost certainly true.
If you look at those tweets exclusively,

24
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,113
you capture all of the announcements and
cabinet picks as well as the holiday 

25
00:01:34,481 --> 00:01:38,320
messages and the notes of condolence of 
those 59 tweets,

26
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:43,350
49 share links or are retweets and all 
or almost all of them are likely written

27
00:01:43,961 --> 00:01:47,950
by Dan Scavino,
trump's director of social media or Brad

28
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:48,783
Parscale,
a website designer turned high level 

29
00:01:49,631 --> 00:01:53,560
staffer who trump and trusted with 
tweeting for him during the presidential

30
00:01:53,561 --> 00:01:57,760
debates of the 153 tweets that come from
trump's personal samsung.

31
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,910
Not One shares a link,
so that's a good rule of thumb.

32
00:02:00,911 --> 00:02:04,000
If you want to determine which tweets 
are from him and which aren't.

33
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,313
The huge majority of the android tweets 
are trump's personal thoughts or 

34
00:02:08,441 --> 00:02:09,274
reactions.
Then you can split them up in a few 

35
00:02:10,601 --> 00:02:11,680
ways.
For example,

36
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:15,190
40 of those are positive were 
congratulatory and tone.

37
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:20,370
Ninety four are negative or critical in 
tone and 19 are pretty much neutral like

38
00:02:21,401 --> 00:02:23,200
in a speech.
One thing trump is really,

39
00:02:23,201 --> 00:02:24,034
really good at is emotionally framing 
his tweets and most of them are 

40
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:28,564
emotionally charged,
which is why 87 percent of them are 

41
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,133
negative or positive in tone.
Trump doesn't want a sympathetic reader 

42
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:40,300
to spend any time at all the ciphering,
how to feel about what he's saying.

43
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:41,403
A lot of people have mocked the way he 
concludes tweets with one or two word 

44
00:02:43,811 --> 00:02:44,644
exclamations like sad or too bad,
but these punctuations are actually 

45
00:02:48,581 --> 00:02:53,110
powerful framing devices that lubricate 
the content of his message.

46
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:57,940
They also reflect a key insight that 
trump has knowingly or unknowingly about

47
00:02:57,941 --> 00:03:00,970
twitter and texting as a form of 
communication.

48
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:03,700
While tweets are technically a kind of 
writing,

49
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:04,863
scholars have long theorize that 
computer mediated communication more 

50
00:03:08,651 --> 00:03:09,484
closely resembles speech than writing 
were funky punctuation substitutes for 

51
00:03:14,381 --> 00:03:16,450
conversational cues.
For example,

52
00:03:16,451 --> 00:03:20,170
every time you see someone extend toward
by adding letters saying,

53
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:24,370
I'm so sad,
or I love breaking bad,

54
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:25,443
what they're essentially doing is trying
to transmit some emotional content that 

55
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:31,360
would have existed in face to face 
conversation,

56
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,253
instant messages,
text messages and tweets attract these 

57
00:03:34,601 --> 00:03:37,900
speech like qualities and Donald trump 
understands this.

58
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,090
While he doesn't extend words with extra
letters,

59
00:03:40,091 --> 00:03:43,460
his punctuation at the end of tweets are
extremely speech.

60
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,333
Slide 50,
one of his 153 personal tweets end with 

61
00:03:47,021 --> 00:03:49,120
exclamations like this.
In [inaudible] 95,

62
00:03:49,121 --> 00:03:50,860
there was at least one exclamation 
point.

63
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,950
Whereas opponents and other politicians 
right through twitter,

64
00:03:53,951 --> 00:03:55,110
trump speaks through.

65
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:58,930
Instead of asking us to read,
he forces us to here,

66
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,120
but all of this begs the important 
question,

67
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:04,330
what's the point?
Trump is no longer a candidate.

68
00:04:04,331 --> 00:04:06,400
He doesn't have to persuade us to vote 
for him.

69
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,890
I mean,
you could spend a lot of time looking at

70
00:04:08,891 --> 00:04:09,724
a tweet like this from the president 
elect of the United States scratching 

71
00:04:12,821 --> 00:04:13,654
your head and you could wonder about the
message or the distraction it causes 

72
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:19,990
were the headlines that generates,
but if that's the way you think,

73
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:25,180
this man will always baffled you.
Trump doesn't resemble other politicians

74
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:28,390
on twitter.
He resembles the rest of us.

75
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:29,373
He resembles that person you know on 
facebook who was posting all the time 

76
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,033
about how happy they are.
Nice people don't tweet or post because 

77
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,500
they're trying to relay relevant 
information.

78
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:39,783
They do it to carefully craft their own 
identities against some imagined 

79
00:04:43,661 --> 00:04:48,040
audience that exists only to reinforce 
what they need to believe.

80
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:49,203
The media and the public act like 
trump's tweets contain messages that 

81
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,133
were meant to receive when the truth is,
I think that he's not thinking of us at 

82
00:04:58,601 --> 00:05:00,460
all.
When you look at it through this lens,

83
00:05:00,461 --> 00:05:02,590
trump's twitter account makes a lot more
sense.

84
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,424
It makes sense that a lot of his 
congratulatory tweets are self 

85
00:05:06,401 --> 00:05:10,300
congratulatory and his negative tweets,
which account for an astounding majority

86
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,050
are personal in their attacks and sense 
of victimization,

87
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:18,100
and it makes sense that we should react 
to it so strongly.

88
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:18,993
We're all in this age of social media,
intimately familiar with this kind of 

89
00:05:21,761 --> 00:05:24,480
behavior.
We do it ourselves every day.

90
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:25,613
What we're not familiar with not yet at 
least is this kind of thing from the 

91
00:05:29,221 --> 00:05:30,054
most powerful person in the world.
How it will fall out when you hold a 

92
00:05:34,021 --> 00:05:38,040
position where even your words 
desperately tweeted into the void,

93
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:43,050
have global impact,
but give it time and we will be.

94
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,990
There are going to be tons more at nerd 
writer episodes in 2017.

95
00:05:49,991 --> 00:05:54,820
So if you want to join this crazy thing 
that I started five years ago,

96
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,070
you can click that box right over there 
and subscribe to channel and you'll

97
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:02,300
get all the videos.
I really am so excited for next year.

98
00:06:02,301 --> 00:06:03,134
I want to level up the show,
make content that you have not seen 

99
00:06:06,111 --> 00:06:08,780
anywhere else on youtube or the rest of 
the world,

100
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,570
and I'm really excited to bring that to 
you guys.

101
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:12,404
I'm working really hard to do it.
I have to think crunchy roll for 

102
00:06:13,881 --> 00:06:17,150
sponsoring this episode.
If you really love anime shows,

103
00:06:17,151 --> 00:06:20,390
which I do and you can't find what 
you're looking for on Netflix,

104
00:06:20,391 --> 00:06:22,770
you can go to control.
It's like the Netflix of animated.

105
00:06:22,771 --> 00:06:24,830
They have hd episodes,
thousands of titles,

106
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:27,590
something areas in Japan.
You can get it an hour later on.

107
00:06:27,591 --> 00:06:30,350
Crunchy roll.
I want to recommend attack on Titan,

108
00:06:30,351 --> 00:06:32,240
which is super,
super weird show,

109
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:34,280
but an amazing show I can pitch you.
Love it.

110
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,273
Um,
if you use [inaudible] dot com slash 

111
00:06:36,591 --> 00:06:39,920
nerd writing and get 30 day free trial 
and watch that show and let me know what

112
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:42,110
you think of the comments.
Thank you guys so much.

113
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:45,770
I will see all of you next year.
I'm so excited.
