1
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:22,370
I had just turned 13 when the first 
Harry Potter movie came out.

2
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:23,803
According to Warner brothers,
nearly 60 percent of the people who saw 

3
00:00:26,451 --> 00:00:30,870
that movie were 17 or younger.
For a whole general,

4
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:32,423
the Harry Potter series spanned are 
adolescents and imprinted onto our 

5
00:00:35,491 --> 00:00:37,170
lives.
A love of reading,

6
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:38,813
but less has been said about the films.
I think their commitment to good 

7
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:43,703
cinematic work was potentially just as 
important for young people's filmic 

8
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:48,863
education as j Dot k dot rowling's 
accomplishments were for our literary 

9
00:00:52,321 --> 00:00:53,580
upwork.
For me,

10
00:00:53,581 --> 00:00:56,040
that all starts with Alfonzo,
Koran,

11
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:56,963
and the third film in the series,
the prisoner of Azkaban coming at a 

12
00:01:00,361 --> 00:01:03,000
crucial time in both the books and the 
films.

13
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:04,163
Azkaban marks.
Potters transitioned from perilous 

14
00:01:06,031 --> 00:01:06,864
adventure stories for children to 
increasingly dark increasingly nuanced 

15
00:01:12,451 --> 00:01:15,720
treatments of character and plot.
Pick,

16
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:16,291
inquire,
Ron,

17
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:17,124
to handle this passage seems perfect in 
retrospect as it set the tone for the 

18
00:01:21,031 --> 00:01:24,390
grimmer and grimy or final installment 
of the series,

19
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:25,763
but warner brothers has to be credited 
for taking a chance on a director whose 

20
00:01:28,501 --> 00:01:32,190
previous film was an explicit Mexican 
road trip,

21
00:01:32,191 --> 00:01:34,660
drove about sexual discovery.

22
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:39,010
A lot of the style of that film and 
Korans previous work is readily apparent

23
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:39,863
in Azkaban,
most notably his fondness for a moving 

24
00:01:42,701 --> 00:01:46,390
often handheld camera.
Just take a quick sped up.

25
00:01:46,391 --> 00:01:49,060
Look at this early scene from the Great 
Hall,

26
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,433
not a single shot is stationary.
This gives the scene and the film a 

27
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:58,230
feeling of forward momentum and 
establishes a curious camera,

28
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,333
but it also lends to the film a sense of
unease and inability to find stable 

29
00:02:04,221 --> 00:02:05,054
footing.
Now for a film that is to be haunted by 

30
00:02:06,861 --> 00:02:07,694
a feared killer throughout such a style 
is fitting and this isn't the only 

31
00:02:12,271 --> 00:02:17,271
signature technique Koran brings to 
potter is famous use of the long tail is

32
00:02:17,491 --> 00:02:18,324
here as well.
The shot right here is a minute and 49 

33
00:02:20,881 --> 00:02:21,714
seconds long,
and as the critic Kristen Thompson has 

34
00:02:23,191 --> 00:02:24,024
noted,
it marks a crucial tonal shift in the 

35
00:02:26,311 --> 00:02:28,140
film.
The first two scenes,

36
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:32,970
one in which Harry blows up,
his horrible aunt and one which he takes

37
00:02:32,971 --> 00:02:33,480
a ride on.

38
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,900
The ridiculous night busts are both 
pretty lighthearted.

39
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:37,973
Good.
Almost say that these two scenes are a 

40
00:02:38,911 --> 00:02:39,744
nod to the two comparatively lighter 
films that came before this in this 

41
00:02:44,641 --> 00:02:45,474
scene and this shot Harry learns of the 
true danger he faces than what's 

42
00:02:50,191 --> 00:02:52,080
important to notice here is that with 
deeper,

43
00:02:52,081 --> 00:02:52,914
more significant peril comes deeper,
more significant isolation Mr Weasley 

44
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:00,940
pulls Harry into another part of the 
leaky cauldron,

45
00:03:00,941 --> 00:03:01,774
separating him from his friends while 
keeping the specter of Sirius black in 

46
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,753
the foreground.
When the conversation turns explicitly 

47
00:03:08,681 --> 00:03:09,514
to black,
is images placed between them with 

48
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,750
family and friends framed in the 
background.

49
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:17,800
Then Mr Risley pulls Harry into an 
alcove so that they are alone,

50
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,930
asking Harry not to go looking for 
black.

51
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:24,640
And finally for the key dramatic 
question and period on the scene.

52
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:28,610
Well Ron Frames Harry completely by 
himself.

53
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,900
Now,
this is great film.

54
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:36,230
Isolation will go on to be a key theme 
in Asca Pan and the rest of the series,

55
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,333
despite its constant message of 
friendship and it's focus on the bond 

56
00:03:40,671 --> 00:03:42,620
between Harry Ron and her mining.

57
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:45,980
The series returns with Ridley to 
Harry's,

58
00:03:45,981 --> 00:03:50,981
feelings of being alone.
The chosen one is gradual realization of

59
00:03:50,991 --> 00:03:53,780
a burden that he must carry without 
help.

60
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:55,413
Prisoner of Azkaban reflects,
deepens and foreshadows these feelings 

61
00:03:58,661 --> 00:03:59,494
by separating Harry out from his 
surroundings or else placing him apart 

62
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:07,750
from those around him.
Koran never misses a chance to return to

63
00:04:07,751 --> 00:04:08,584
this theme,
whether it means separating Harry from 

64
00:04:10,601 --> 00:04:13,150
his friends in a shot about something 
else,

65
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:18,510
telling Emma Watson to neal out of a 
shot or ending the movie by having Harry

66
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:24,210
literally fly away from a crowd.
Internal consistency.

67
00:04:24,251 --> 00:04:25,084
This is one of Koran's major strengths.
That's what makes the prisoner of 

68
00:04:27,911 --> 00:04:30,910
Azkaban a cut above the rest of the 
films in the series,

69
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:31,893
some of which are quite good motifs 
shoot back and forth across the runtime 

70
00:04:37,171 --> 00:04:40,060
like magic spells and comment on each 
other,

71
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:40,923
tightening a web that leases meaning 
throughout little things like following 

72
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:50,890
empty footsteps in the snow before 
introducing a key object that visualizes

73
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:54,520
people moving through hogwarts castle 
with footsteps.

74
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:55,923
Some immediate foreshadowing there,
but what about some longer 

75
00:04:58,211 --> 00:04:59,044
foreshadowing?
Maybe a little bird that flies around 

76
00:05:01,511 --> 00:05:02,344
the grounds in the beginning of the film
to places will only later occur to us 

77
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:09,640
that map the sites of significant scenes
in the movie,

78
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:10,803
or what about something more meaningful 
like Korans recurring motif of moving 

79
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:15,214
the camera through glass,
a Motif that pays off twice in this 

80
00:05:19,121 --> 00:05:21,550
scene where the students fight off of 
Bulger,

81
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,413
a creature that visualizes your worst 
fear twice in this seat into beautiful 

82
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:30,400
shots.
The camera moves through the mirrors.

83
00:05:30,401 --> 00:05:31,234
Have this wardrobe suggesting that while
it's important to look through windows 

84
00:05:34,871 --> 00:05:38,590
and see the world,
you can also look through mirrors,

85
00:05:38,591 --> 00:05:39,424
which is to say into yourself.
Not to mention that these shots just 

86
00:05:43,391 --> 00:05:44,860
make you think,
wait,

87
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:49,630
how did he do that?
A great question for any young film goer

88
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,940
to ask,
and that's the point here,

89
00:05:51,941 --> 00:05:52,360
isn't it?

90
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,193
We hear so much about a film industry 
that continues to pump out crap films 

91
00:05:57,621 --> 00:06:00,740
that's ruled by lowest common 
denominator fair.

92
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:02,870
Oh,
there are a number of reasons for that,

93
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:03,963
but one of them is that a lot of the 
movie going public suffers from 

94
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:10,850
cinematic illiteracy.
We don't know what makes a good film,

95
00:06:10,851 --> 00:06:15,170
so the industry serves up superficial 
projects that play on cheap emotions and

96
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,273
make us into passive viewers,
but learning film is always an active 

97
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,213
enterprise.
All great movies are teaching movies 

98
00:06:24,831 --> 00:06:29,630
because they encourage us to participate
with them and with the whole of cinema.

99
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,660
This is why the prisoner of Azkaban is 
so important,

100
00:06:32,661 --> 00:06:33,494
like anything,
it's easy to develop a taste for 

101
00:06:34,731 --> 00:06:36,860
something when we learn it.
Young.

102
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,220
Harry Potter is a mega franchise.
One,

103
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,113
millions of kids bought tickets for and 
millions more will watch and rewatch at 

104
00:06:46,521 --> 00:06:47,354
home.
Having a great film like this in that 

105
00:06:50,211 --> 00:06:51,440
roster.
Well,

106
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:52,303
the results could be exponential.
Small light that in the end shines much 

107
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:02,060
brighter than anyone would expect.

108
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:08,860
Hey,

109
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:11,950
thanks for watching.
Obviously I'm a huge Harry Potter Fan.

110
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,470
I grew up with those books,
those ages at the beginning.

111
00:07:14,471 --> 00:07:18,010
We're actually my ages,
so this was a blast to make.

112
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:21,240
I want to thank you guys actually 
because a lot of people actually pledged

113
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:22,074
a dollar or $3 after last week's video 
and those small pledges really mean so 

114
00:07:26,651 --> 00:07:30,880
much because what matters to me is that 
if you have the ability to pledge,

115
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:31,773
I'm trying to do so over a longterm 
period because the patrion is really my 

116
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,024
salary.
So knowing what I'm going to get gives 

117
00:07:39,281 --> 00:07:43,090
me the ability to plan new projects,
bigger projects in the future.

118
00:07:43,091 --> 00:07:44,680
It just makes everything a lot more 
stable.

119
00:07:44,681 --> 00:07:46,930
So I'd rather you do a dollar,
you know,

120
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,520
over a year,
then,

121
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,830
you know,
$5 or $10 over a couple of weeks.

122
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,753
Obviously if you can do $5 over a year,
you're amazing and I can't even believe 

123
00:07:54,671 --> 00:07:55,650
it.
Um,

124
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,630
but thank you guys for everything you've
donated to this channel.

125
00:07:58,631 --> 00:07:59,464
It's been amazing.
It's helped me grow this thing and it's 

126
00:08:02,021 --> 00:08:04,150
growing really fast now and it's a 
really exciting.

127
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:05,740
People are watching and paying 
attention,

128
00:08:05,741 --> 00:08:08,560
which is all I ever wanted to start.
So thank you again.

129
00:08:08,561 --> 00:08:10,420
I will see you guys next Wednesday.
