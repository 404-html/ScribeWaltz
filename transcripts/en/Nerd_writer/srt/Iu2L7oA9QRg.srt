1
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:10,670
The end of the 19th century,
the cigarette existed at the center of a

2
00:00:10,671 --> 00:00:11,504
lot of different cultural forces.
The one you're looking at right here is 

3
00:00:14,451 --> 00:00:15,284
from a painting by Edvard Munch,
most famous for another canvas called 

4
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,233
screen.
This self portrait with cigarette may 

5
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,580
two years later,
though less jarring is just as concerned

6
00:00:25,581 --> 00:00:26,414
with monks personal psychology and the 
dark underside of his identity as the 

7
00:00:31,611 --> 00:00:32,444
scream is,
but to his critics in his hometown of 

8
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:36,770
Oslow,
the portraits dark.

9
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:41,270
He's unfinished.
Feeling was not only unfit for art,

10
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,300
it was dangerous to the psychology of 
the city and the age as monks.

11
00:00:46,301 --> 00:00:49,640
Self portrait demonstrates he is by no 
means a normal man.

12
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:54,230
When an artist is abnormal,
a shadow is thrown over all his art.

13
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:57,040
That's a quote by Johann 
Scharffenberger,

14
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:57,893
Norwegian medical student who was 
echoing align of conservative moral 

15
00:01:01,671 --> 00:01:02,504
thinking that feared the decay of 
society resulting from art like that 

16
00:01:06,261 --> 00:01:08,600
monk and his contemporaries or making.

17
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:09,703
This pessimistic attitude was 
popularized in a large book called 

18
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:14,990
degeneration by this guy,
Max,

19
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:15,824
nor Nordell,
who attacked pretty much every kind of 

20
00:01:17,451 --> 00:01:18,284
art that wasn't up to his moral 
standards as poisonous and corrupting 

21
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:22,783
for Scharfenberg nor Dow.
The cigarette was symptomatic of 

22
00:01:25,581 --> 00:01:28,640
societies degeneration.
It was along with alcohol,

23
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:29,563
one of civilizations ugly indulgences,
but for monk and his circle of decadent 

24
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:34,994
artists,
the cigarette was something much 

25
00:01:36,621 --> 00:01:37,454
different for them.
The end of the 19th century also 

26
00:01:39,651 --> 00:01:43,820
represented a change,
but it was a chance for a break from the

27
00:01:43,821 --> 00:01:44,654
stale bourgeoisie values,
the prudish and uptight conservative 

28
00:01:48,171 --> 00:01:52,520
values of Nortel and his acolytes.
In 18 nineties,

29
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:53,373
Europe.
The cigarette still wasn't all that 

30
00:01:54,411 --> 00:01:56,330
popular.
Only 10 years earlier,

31
00:01:56,331 --> 00:01:57,164
James Albert bond sack invented a 
rolling machine which made it possible 

32
00:02:00,021 --> 00:02:04,550
to mass produce 200 cigarettes a minute,
but they were still dwarfed by the sales

33
00:02:04,551 --> 00:02:06,140
of cigars and pipes.

34
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:07,363
The since the beginning when beggars in 
Spain took the discarded tobacco from 

35
00:02:10,821 --> 00:02:14,360
Cigar Butts and reroll them.
The cigarette had always been associated

36
00:02:14,361 --> 00:02:16,670
with the lower classes in the Crimean 
war.

37
00:02:16,671 --> 00:02:19,280
Soldiers Roll Tobacco and old 
newspapers,

38
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,313
and by the 18 nineties when machine made
cigarettes were cheaper to produce and 

39
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:23,684
by the working classes of Europe began 
adopting the cigarette while the 

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,120
middleclass especially the men stuck to 
their cigars.

41
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:33,620
This lithograph by Thea fill steenland 
captures the feeling perfectly.

42
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:34,573
Notice how the bourgeoisie man clad in 
his proper dress and hat uses his cigar 

43
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:39,463
to light the cigarette for the man with 
the loose color who is clearly of a 

44
00:02:42,441 --> 00:02:43,274
lower social standing.
It was in the lower classes that monk 

45
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:46,603
and his Bohemian contemporaries found 
their alternative to the suffocating 

46
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:50,773
middleclass value system.
They traded in drawing rooms for late 

47
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:57,980
night cafes,
dinner parties for nightclubs and cigars

48
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:58,993
for cigarettes.
Cigarettes became the essential prop of 

49
00:03:02,021 --> 00:03:05,520
the Bohemian lifestyle in this painting 
by mentor Christian Kroger,

50
00:03:05,521 --> 00:03:06,354
you can see a 21 year old edvard monk 
lighting up with his friends and fellow 

51
00:03:09,521 --> 00:03:12,880
painters in his studio in this etching 
by Moog himself.

52
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:13,743
Smoke snakes and fills up the atmosphere
of a cafe where Bohemian intellectuals 

53
00:03:18,161 --> 00:03:21,520
of both genders drink and debate art and
ideas.

54
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:22,743
In other words,
everything Max nor Dow despised as 

55
00:03:25,961 --> 00:03:27,580
critic Patricia Berman.
Notes,

56
00:03:27,581 --> 00:03:28,414
Bohemians of the 18 eighties and 
nineties embraced the deviancy that 

57
00:03:31,601 --> 00:03:32,434
people like Nortel assigned to them.
They existed somewhere between the 

58
00:03:35,831 --> 00:03:40,831
middle class and the NRC of the streets 
and their aesthetic revolt was the birth

59
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:45,660
of what we can see now.
Was cigarette cool for monks work.

60
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:49,030
This meant moving away from the 
naturalism of his predecessors,

61
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,850
the scientific recording of the natural 
world,

62
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,713
even moving away from impressionism,
which monks all as little more than 

63
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,333
formal exercises with light,
his task would be to dig into his own 

64
00:04:00,551 --> 00:04:01,384
psyche and record subjective experience.
That's how you get something as 

65
00:04:05,501 --> 00:04:06,334
terrifying as the scream.
This is how dark subjectivity warps the 

66
00:04:09,851 --> 00:04:11,980
natural world.
As he wrote later,

67
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,380
I was walking along the road with two 
friends.

68
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:18,220
The Sun was setting.
Suddenly the sky turned blood red.

69
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,383
I paused,
feeling exhausted and leaned on the 

70
00:04:20,981 --> 00:04:21,814
fence.
There was blood and tongues of fire 

71
00:04:23,381 --> 00:04:25,780
above the blue,
black fjord and the city.

72
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:26,643
My friends walked on and I stood there 
trembling with anxiety and I sensed an 

73
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:34,710
infinite screen passing through nature.
You read any diary or memoir of a suffer

74
00:04:34,961 --> 00:04:39,310
of depression and you'll find similar 
moments of disturbing transformation.

75
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:40,773
The truth is that mental illness was 
underscoring this whole transitional 

76
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:44,584
time in history.
As nations came to grips with the rapid 

77
00:04:46,931 --> 00:04:48,610
growth of anxiety,
depression,

78
00:04:48,611 --> 00:04:50,710
mania,
and other mental illnesses,

79
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,410
different groups reacted in different 
ways.

80
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:57,280
It's what's really at the heart of 
Nordhaus fears of degeneration.

81
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:01,060
It's what a number of Bohemian artists 
of the era were attempting to explore in

82
00:05:01,061 --> 00:05:01,894
their work.
The tragic relationship between madness 

83
00:05:04,361 --> 00:05:08,650
and creativity is undeniable.
Some ran from that fact.

84
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:11,500
Others refuse to look away.
At this time,

85
00:05:11,501 --> 00:05:14,710
there was a kind of catchall term that's
no longer really in use.

86
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:15,933
Neurasthenia,
something that's probably more akin 

87
00:05:17,681 --> 00:05:18,514
today to acute anxiety or mild mania and
here to the cigarette is significant 

88
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,830
because there was a belief floating 
around that cigarette smoking was one of

89
00:05:26,831 --> 00:05:27,664
the causes of insanity.
A theory put forward in a book by Dr El 

90
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:35,020
Brammer called tobacco insanity and 
nervousness and another doctor,

91
00:05:35,021 --> 00:05:35,854
the surgeon Theodore Bill Roth,
believed that the widespread cases of 

92
00:05:38,801 --> 00:05:43,180
Neurasthenia and neuroses were due to 
alcohol and cigarettes.

93
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,640
Now,
if you look again at monks self portrait

94
00:05:45,641 --> 00:05:46,474
with cigarette,
you can see a nexus of all these social 

95
00:05:49,631 --> 00:05:52,480
constructions.
Monk is aware of his critics,

96
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:56,590
their belief in his degeneration and the
cigarette as one of its causes.

97
00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:01,370
He uses it as a formal reason why the 
painting is nebulous.

98
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,473
It's shrouded in cigarette smoke,
but he's also using this dissolution by 

99
00:06:05,931 --> 00:06:09,950
way of cigarette to signal the 
intersection between Bohemian life,

100
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:14,060
mental illness and art,
the prevalence of mental illness.

101
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:14,893
It's connection with genius and the 
failure of Bourgeoisie moralizing to 

102
00:06:18,471 --> 00:06:19,304
come to grips with these realities.
He encoded the cigarette as a complex 

103
00:06:22,911 --> 00:06:23,744
symbol through which he asserted his 
complex identity and created a site of 

104
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:28,663
recognition for those who suffer today 
because the problem of mental illness 

105
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:33,913
has only grown and its growth has grown 
to and we're not that much more 

106
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:41,060
enlightened as to its causes than we 
were then.

107
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:47,220
But I think that monks work is the 
constellation because it proves that our

108
00:06:47,811 --> 00:06:48,644
confusion about mental illness in 
medicine and science will always be 

109
00:06:52,731 --> 00:06:57,731
matched by a probing and nuanced 
understanding and art of all kinds.

110
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:06,700
Hey everybody.
Thanks for watching.

111
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,510
Welcome to my new apartment in Los 
Angeles.

112
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:12,500
I just moved down here a couple days ago
with my girlfriend and it's actually our

113
00:07:12,501 --> 00:07:15,290
one year anniversary today,
so if you're watching this,

114
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:18,260
actually you're definitely watching this
because we're in the other room watching

115
00:07:18,261 --> 00:07:20,720
this together right now.
I love you so much.

116
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:21,973
Happy Anniversary.
It's been the best year of my life and 

117
00:07:24,411 --> 00:07:25,244
you're the best person that I've ever 
known and I'm definitely not going to 

118
00:07:28,341 --> 00:07:29,174
choke up on this end screen,
so I'll just close it here by saying 

119
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:34,190
I'll see you guys next Wednesday.
