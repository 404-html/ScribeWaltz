1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:04,920
Coffee at 4:00
AM on a Saturday night and blog 28,

2
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,440
and so tonight we are on the set of my 
very good friend,

3
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:19,283
Nolan as new short film Motel Blues.
Tonight we're filming at the pear 

4
00:00:22,521 --> 00:00:23,354
blossom motel up about 60 miles north of
Los Angeles and we have the whole motel 

5
00:00:28,191 --> 00:00:29,024
rented out for the night,
which by the way is one of the coolest 

6
00:00:30,741 --> 00:00:34,070
things about independent filmmaking and 
filmmaking in general is that you get to

7
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:37,730
use real locations like this and 
repurpose them for your movie.

8
00:00:37,731 --> 00:00:40,940
Tonight I want to show you what goes 
into making a short film of this stature

9
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:41,893
and one thing you should understand is 
that the only difference between this 

10
00:00:43,731 --> 00:00:44,564
and a movie you might see at your local 
AMC is the amount of money in the 

11
00:00:47,331 --> 00:00:48,164
budget.
The way this film is being made is the 

12
00:00:48,951 --> 00:00:51,310
way all films are made.
A big budget blow.

13
00:00:51,311 --> 00:00:52,130
It might have,
you know,

14
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:55,160
more people on the crew,
more freedom with time and locations and

15
00:00:55,161 --> 00:00:55,994
equipment,
but all the necessary stuff is here and 

16
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:01,490
it's left like all films to the actors.
The story,

17
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:04,340
the filming techniques and the vision of
the director,

18
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,810
but let me,
let me introduce you to the quick.

19
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:07,693
Let's.
Let's.

20
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:28,993
Okay,
so first we had the unit production 

21
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:31,424
manager or ups whose job it is to manage
the production from before the filming 

22
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,253
to after upm will create a working 
budget before principal photography and 

23
00:01:39,531 --> 00:01:42,500
do her level best to make sure that the 
final cost,

24
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,960
it doesn't go too much over the mark on 
smaller productions.

25
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:49,610
The UPM is also responsible for hiring a
casting agent as well as anyone else the

26
00:01:49,611 --> 00:01:50,630
crew might need.
In short,

27
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:55,430
this person's sails the ship as calmly 
as she can to ward principle photography

28
00:01:55,431 --> 00:01:56,264
when the assistant director or add 
assumes the job as onset organizer 80 

29
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,053
maintains order on the set as hooligans 
from every department and run this way 

30
00:02:04,671 --> 00:02:05,504
and that to arrange the shot,
the 80 rights and sends out call sheets 

31
00:02:08,151 --> 00:02:08,984
which are scheduled for the days of 
shooting and the 80 calls out 

32
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:13,630
necessarily commands before the shot 
starts.

33
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:18,630
It sounds sort of like this.
Roll audio roll camera.

34
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:25,070
Next we have the sound record is quite 
possibly the most overlooked,

35
00:02:25,071 --> 00:02:27,920
underrated,
and important job on an indie film set.

36
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:28,783
It's difficult to communicate just how 
much sound determines the way we 

37
00:02:32,001 --> 00:02:32,834
perceive a movie.
Filmmaking gets branded as largely a 

38
00:02:35,001 --> 00:02:36,740
visual medium,
but poorly recorded.

39
00:02:36,741 --> 00:02:40,580
Sam can destroy an otherwise great 
project to record good sound,

40
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,593
good dialogue,
which means recording all the many 

41
00:02:42,801 --> 00:02:46,430
frequencies of the human voice.
The record is used as a boom or lavalier

42
00:02:46,431 --> 00:02:49,730
mic to get as close to the actors' 
mouths as possible.

43
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,310
This requires coordination with the DP 
and the director,

44
00:02:52,311 --> 00:02:53,144
making sure that they set up the shot so
that the recorders can position his mic 

45
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,700
close,
but at a frank.

46
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:01,000
Next we have the and his assistant.
The best board.

47
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,073
These gentlemen are responsible for 
lighting a movie and as a film is 

48
00:03:04,781 --> 00:03:07,360
essentially a combination of light and 
darkness.

49
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,313
They're responsibility is huge.
Film lighting is exceedingly tricky 

50
00:03:11,411 --> 00:03:12,244
because the camera lens sees differently
than the I and the gaffer must 

51
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:18,220
understand that often irrational 
relationship between the two.

52
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,323
When you have a talented one like our 
friend Justin here who can work quickly 

53
00:03:21,641 --> 00:03:22,474
to produce stunning images,
you simply put up with his embarrassing 

54
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,980
personality,
Colby,

55
00:03:26,981 --> 00:03:29,620
Jack.
Next we have hair and makeup and the art

56
00:03:29,621 --> 00:03:30,454
director.
Hair and makeup is responsible for 

57
00:03:31,391 --> 00:03:32,224
making the accurus look good and the art
director has that same responsibility 

58
00:03:34,871 --> 00:03:35,704
for the set.
The Art director can take an otherwise 

59
00:03:37,331 --> 00:03:40,090
blend space and create the appropriate 
mood with furniture,

60
00:03:40,091 --> 00:03:41,440
trinkets,
whatever he can find.

61
00:03:41,441 --> 00:03:42,274
There's nothing and art director likes 
more than a thrift store full of other 

62
00:03:44,981 --> 00:03:45,814
people's throwaway junk.
Next we have the assistant camera 

63
00:03:47,981 --> 00:03:48,814
people,
those quiet warriors who serve as the 

64
00:03:50,351 --> 00:03:51,041
third,
fourth,

65
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:52,030
fifth,
and sixth,

66
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:53,080
the hands of the DP.

67
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,060
The Camera Department must assemble the 
camera,

68
00:03:55,061 --> 00:03:55,894
attach it to whatever tripod or rig will
be used for the shot and question and 

69
00:03:58,691 --> 00:04:01,630
perform that daunting and also under 
appreciated task.

70
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:03,210
No,
as focus pulling,

71
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:04,443
see a camera lens can only focus on one 
cross section of space away from the 

72
00:04:07,961 --> 00:04:10,180
camera.
It being a larger small cross section,

73
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:13,870
depending on the lens and the light,
if either the actors where the camera is

74
00:04:13,871 --> 00:04:14,704
moving during the shot,
the noble focus puller must buy soft 

75
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:18,543
adjustments of the Lens,
make sure the talent stays within the 

76
00:04:21,221 --> 00:04:24,430
given cross section or depth of field.
It's like a game.

77
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:28,090
The most infuriating game ever created,
all the work done by the gaffer.

78
00:04:28,091 --> 00:04:28,924
His assistant and the camera department 
is done to satisfy the demands of the 

79
00:04:31,781 --> 00:04:32,614
director of photography or DP,
working closely with the director and 

80
00:04:35,051 --> 00:04:37,900
being his first partner.
The DP determines the shot,

81
00:04:37,901 --> 00:04:39,610
how it will be lit,
how the camera will move,

82
00:04:39,611 --> 00:04:40,444
what the framing will be,
all in an effort to serve the needs of 

83
00:04:42,971 --> 00:04:43,690
the story.

84
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:48,100
Everything a camera does is felt by the 
audience and the DEP must understand and

85
00:04:48,101 --> 00:04:52,540
manipulate the rules of composition that
we might feel what the story wants us to

86
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:53,374
feel.
The DP directs our attention to what we 

87
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:55,894
need to see.
The other job of the DP always make the 

88
00:04:58,121 --> 00:05:00,070
actors look good.
The of supply,

89
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:00,923
the human element to it felt they take 
written characters and make them real 

90
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:06,100
for the audience to love or hate 
whatever the story demands.

91
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,113
They are subservient to the director,
but often is the case that actors being 

92
00:05:09,671 --> 00:05:10,504
students of human behavior find a way to
present their characters which the 

93
00:05:12,881 --> 00:05:16,360
director would never have thought of in 
which in fact serve his ends better.

94
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:17,283
It's important therefore to give actors 
freedom to find what's real in the 

95
00:05:20,231 --> 00:05:22,150
dialogue and action written for them.
After all,

96
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,860
the audience will never see the script.

97
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,380
They will see the actors and nine times 
out of 10,

98
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:27,363
the performances are what they'll be 
talking about on the car ride home and 

99
00:05:30,191 --> 00:05:32,980
finally we get to the most important 
part of a film.

100
00:05:32,981 --> 00:05:35,650
The part on which everything else 
hinges.

101
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,750
Craft services,
yes.

102
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:38,643
Where the food is.
It's perhaps impossible to say what a 

103
00:05:40,331 --> 00:05:43,300
film shoot can become if the crew is not
satiated.

104
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,193
It starts with whispers of maltreatment.
Wines and backtalk sharp attitudes and 

105
00:05:48,251 --> 00:05:49,270
chatting.
Before you know it,

106
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,380
someone is throwing a one k at the 
director's head for goodness sakes.

107
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,440
Feed your crew if it's possible,
spoil them.

108
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,480
The respect and quality work you'll get 
in return will be worth it.

109
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,670
And lastly,
the director there will fill,

110
00:06:01,671 --> 00:06:02,504
might sometimes start it's journey to 
the theater at the pen of a 

111
00:06:04,911 --> 00:06:05,744
screenwriter,
and though in unhappy circumstances it 

112
00:06:07,521 --> 00:06:10,010
may end its journey with the discretion 
of a producer.

113
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,200
There was no question that the artist of
a film,

114
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:16,670
the one whose vision the rest are trying
to realize is the director in its purest

115
00:06:16,671 --> 00:06:17,504
form.
A director plays all the parts I just 

116
00:06:19,221 --> 00:06:20,054
mentioned that of writer director and 
trump card holder in large budget 

117
00:06:23,211 --> 00:06:24,044
pictures.
This is rarely the case and there have 

118
00:06:25,281 --> 00:06:27,260
been plenty of fine films made in that 
system,

119
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,260
but the characteristic quality of low 
budget film,

120
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,153
especially no budget short films,
is that necessity requires that the 

121
00:06:34,371 --> 00:06:36,260
director does indeed play all these 
parts,

122
00:06:36,261 --> 00:06:38,210
including that of the editor.
Here.

123
00:06:38,211 --> 00:06:39,044
We really get to see what's in the 
filmmakers heart and how he translates 

124
00:06:42,351 --> 00:06:43,184
it to the screen.

125
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:51,090
The no escaping slaves like I can be 
submerged and God bless America.

126
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:58,060
God bless America right.
