1
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:02,603
You know,
I don't really get upset about Oscar 

2
00:00:05,401 --> 00:00:08,880
snubs anymore because,
I mean it's the Oscars,

3
00:00:08,881 --> 00:00:09,714
but I was a little sad to hear that Sean
Baker's the Florida project didn't make 

4
00:00:13,411 --> 00:00:14,244
the cut for best picture this year 
because I think when it comes to the 

5
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:18,623
Academy Awards,
the nominations really matter more than 

6
00:00:20,581 --> 00:00:21,414
who the eventual winner is.
It's always silly to pick the best 

7
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,630
anything when it comes to art,
but with the nominations,

8
00:00:27,631 --> 00:00:28,464
at least the 7,000
members of the academy get a chance to 

9
00:00:30,661 --> 00:00:34,470
highlight the field of diverse 
transformative films.

10
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,750
If the Oscars won't highlight the 
Florida project,

11
00:00:39,751 --> 00:00:42,270
then I'm happy to because it's without a
doubt.

12
00:00:42,271 --> 00:00:43,104
One of the best films of 2017 and 
watching it for me was one of those 

13
00:00:47,251 --> 00:00:51,930
transporting experiences that I only get
a few times a year if at all.

14
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:56,370
His story is about a group of kids and 
their parents who live in a budget motel

15
00:00:56,371 --> 00:00:57,204
outside of Disney world in Florida,
that people who live in this community 

16
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:01,830
are the economic margins.

17
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:02,663
Not quite homeless,
but not quite able to keep a permanent 

18
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:05,964
roof over their heads either.
The struggles of living in this kind of 

19
00:01:08,281 --> 00:01:10,530
poverty give the film and undertone of 
sadness,

20
00:01:10,531 --> 00:01:11,364
but the genius of the Florida project is
that it tells its story from the 

21
00:01:14,521 --> 00:01:19,100
perspective of the children who can't 
help but see their world as a playgroup.

22
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:21,630
Baker is pulling heavily from Hell 
roaches,

23
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:24,030
little rascals,
a classic series of comedy,

24
00:01:24,031 --> 00:01:24,864
Short films from the Twenties and 
thirties that was groundbreaking in the 

25
00:01:27,271 --> 00:01:28,104
way that it showed the kids as well,
kids trying to capture the nuances of 

26
00:01:32,461 --> 00:01:33,294
their behavior and energy in a 
naturalistic way like the Florida 

27
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:36,624
project.
Rascals was set against economic 

28
00:01:37,981 --> 00:01:39,360
hardship,
the Great Depression,

29
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,970
these kids to work growing up in 
poverty,

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,833
but the focus was never on that.
It was on the scrappy optimism of 

31
00:01:46,381 --> 00:01:47,300
childhood.
Now,

32
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,710
the Florida project has deeper ambitions
than rascals,

33
00:01:49,711 --> 00:01:50,544
but that optimism,
the brightness of this point of view is 

34
00:01:53,461 --> 00:01:54,150
everything.

35
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,670
It keeps the subject matter from being 
too overwhelming.

36
00:01:56,671 --> 00:02:00,060
Something that can shut down our ability
to empathize and sympathize.

37
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,253
Sean Baker,
I think understand something really 

38
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:03,414
critical about storytelling,
that we don't absorb things by looking 

39
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:07,794
directly at them.
Often we see more clearly through 

40
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:13,290
indirect means.
There's a lot that Baker and co writer,

41
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:14,124
Crispr,
Gosh want to say about the hidden 

42
00:02:15,091 --> 00:02:15,924
homeless in America,
but they don't just come right out and 

43
00:02:17,701 --> 00:02:18,534
say it or show it.
The reality of these troubled lives 

44
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,900
exists in the peripheral vision of a 
child's Day.

45
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,520
Baker in a cinematographer,
Alexis,

46
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:30,630
sob a keep the camera low.
Parents are often framed peanut style,

47
00:02:30,631 --> 00:02:33,300
just a bunch of legs,
even when the kids aren't around,

48
00:02:33,301 --> 00:02:34,134
they favor low angles so that adults 
tower over the frames and through the 

49
00:02:37,141 --> 00:02:37,974
course of the film,
you remember what it's like to see the 

50
00:02:39,931 --> 00:02:41,430
world from such a low ankle.

51
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,473
You remember how big everything seemed 
and how much sky there actually is 

52
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:50,813
carefully building this perspective pays
off in a scene like this where you have 

53
00:02:54,511 --> 00:02:56,850
a key piece of information about these 
people's lives,

54
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:57,893
which is that they struggle so much to 
make their bills that they need the 

55
00:02:59,921 --> 00:03:00,754
assistance of a local church.
Food Bank make replace the scene again 

56
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:04,863
from young Mooney's perspective and we 
have to piece together what's really 

57
00:03:07,931 --> 00:03:08,764
happening here.
He doesn't want to show us the food 

58
00:03:10,601 --> 00:03:14,230
assistance itself.
He wants to show us how normal something

59
00:03:14,231 --> 00:03:17,470
like that is to Moonee.
That's the devastating thing.

60
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,300
In fact,
all of the films,

61
00:03:19,301 --> 00:03:22,150
most crushing moments are played from 
the perspective of kids.

62
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,390
When Mooney's mother's starts 
prostituting herself to make rent.

63
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:28,120
This is the way that the Florida project
shows us

64
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,350
be right back.

65
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,373
This is how the film talks to us.
Something is always seen through 

66
00:03:44,931 --> 00:03:47,360
something else.
The decaying edge lands outside.

67
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:48,194
Disneyworld are seen through the 
colorful imagination of an adventurous 

68
00:03:50,841 --> 00:03:52,820
kid,
the promise of Disney world,

69
00:03:52,821 --> 00:03:55,400
as seen through the poverty that 
surrounds it.

70
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:56,503
The pain of living without work is seen 
through the kindness of neighbors and 

71
00:03:59,751 --> 00:04:03,290
strangers and motel managers and Mooney 
and her mother,

72
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:06,140
Haley,
the films two main characters are seeing

73
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,000
through each other.
In some ways.

74
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:11,060
Haley is a loving,
caring mother and others.

75
00:04:11,061 --> 00:04:13,400
She's a delinquent,
selfish mother.

76
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:14,323
These are all things that we see and 
learn through the way that Mooney acts 

77
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:25,220
in Haley.
We see a Moonie that was child that grew

78
00:04:25,221 --> 00:04:26,054
out of her innocence,
and we also see a Moonie that might be 

79
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,680
this grace.

80
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,373
It's in the continuum of these two that 
the film finds a way to express trues 

81
00:04:39,531 --> 00:04:40,364
that are larger than the movie itself,
for those living in the margins of late 

82
00:04:43,761 --> 00:04:46,940
capitalism tossed around by the wave of 
the great recession,

83
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:51,950
Moonee and Halley are representative of 
a cycle of hardship that can lock itself

84
00:04:51,951 --> 00:04:52,784
into a family tree for decades.
Mothers like Haley bear some of the 

85
00:04:56,301 --> 00:04:57,134
responsibility for the situation,
but we bear some of the responsibility 

86
00:05:00,021 --> 00:05:03,840
too because as the film shows us,
mothers like Haley,

87
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:08,390
really just kids like Mooney and Mooney 
is nothing but innocent.

88
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:13,280
It's a way of understanding the 
individual and societal responsibilities

89
00:05:13,281 --> 00:05:14,114
for poverty that only a film can achieve
and only a film with this kind of 

90
00:05:17,601 --> 00:05:18,470
discipline.
Now,

91
00:05:18,471 --> 00:05:19,304
this doesn't mean that the Florida 
project is trying to Trojan horse a sad 

92
00:05:21,831 --> 00:05:25,160
story to the viewer.
It's an incredibly joyous movie.

93
00:05:25,161 --> 00:05:29,630
It's fun to watch like the little 
rascals and the particular heartbreak we

94
00:05:29,631 --> 00:05:32,780
feel doesn't end.
Can't exist without that joy.

95
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:33,703
Baker couldn't express one without 
expressing the other because he 

96
00:05:36,681 --> 00:05:39,140
understands that they're part of the 
same thing.

97
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,393
That's the kind of understanding,
and this is the kind of filmmaking 

98
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:46,070
academy members should promote through 
their nominations.

99
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,400
It's a shame they didn't,
but I guess I shouldn't mind about snubs

100
00:05:49,401 --> 00:05:52,520
because I mean it's the Oscars.

101
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,660
Hey everybody.
Happy Wednesday.

102
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,583
Thank you so much for watching.
This episode was brought to you by

104

verve is a service that pulls together a
lot of great content channels like 

105

crunchy roll funimation to watch all in 
one place so you can see some of the 

107
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:22,964
best enemy are definitely,
but they've also added a lot of new 

108
00:06:25,131 --> 00:06:30,131
channels like movie which hosts are 
rotating roster of 30 indie movies,

109
00:06:30,231 --> 00:06:31,064
which is something that I love.
One other show that I would personally 

110
00:06:33,231 --> 00:06:34,064
like to recommend is the director's 
chair where director Robert Rodriguez 

111
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:41,120
interviews other directors like Coppola,
George Miller,

112
00:06:41,121 --> 00:06:43,970
Guillermo del Toro.
I've been looking for somewhere to watch

113
00:06:43,971 --> 00:06:47,720
these episodes for so long,
so I'm thrilled that verve has it.

00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,410

122
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,370
I'll see you next time.
