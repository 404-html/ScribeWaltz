1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,870
Okay,
here's an interesting story.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,220
An amendment was made to the clean air 
act in the United States,

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:09,083
aimed at reducing the release of carbon 
monoxide into the atmosphere to reduce 

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:13,763
air pollution.
Part of the law mandated that gasoline 

5
00:00:15,481 --> 00:00:19,410
and automobiles must have a minimum 
amount of oxygen at additive.

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,273
A chemical compound that helps fuel burn
more completely in this limits the 

7
00:00:23,731 --> 00:00:28,731
certain carbon monoxide released into 
the atmosphere from 1992 to 2005.

8
00:00:29,221 --> 00:00:32,520
The most popular oxidative for gasoline 
was methyl,

9
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:34,740
ethyl,
ether or Mtbe,

10
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:35,783
but in the early two thousands,
the number of cases of mtbe 

11
00:00:37,681 --> 00:00:41,670
contaminating groundwater raised 
concerns about its health effects.

12
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:46,230
Gasoline additive mtbe was first noticed
in the water in 2000.

13
00:00:46,231 --> 00:00:48,450
One residential reportedly got sick from
drinking it,

14
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,680
2004,
both New York and California banned that

15
00:00:51,681 --> 00:00:55,050
chemical from the state.
A big blow considering Kelly and and why

16
00:00:55,051 --> 00:00:58,680
accounted for 40 percent of nationwide 
mtbe consumption.

17
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,673
A year later in 2005,
23 more states followed suit and band 

18
00:01:03,181 --> 00:01:04,980
that chemical.
In that same year,

19
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:05,814
Congress passed the Energy Policy Act,
which did not include provisions to 

20
00:01:09,571 --> 00:01:14,100
shield MTB manufacturers from those 
pesky water contamination lawsuits,

21
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,460
and so with no protections against 
growing public outcry,

22
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:18,443
the country was forced to turn to 
alternative ways of gasoline 

23
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:22,493
oxygenation.
What filled the void was ethanol in the 

24
00:01:24,991 --> 00:01:28,350
last 10 years,
ethanol manufacturer and consumption has

25
00:01:28,351 --> 00:01:29,184
risen like a rocket ship in 2010.
The US was the world's top ethanol 

26
00:01:33,031 --> 00:01:33,864
producer with 13 point 2 billion gallons
or 57 point five percent of global 

27
00:01:39,151 --> 00:01:41,050
production.
Ethanol is a biofuel,

28
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:44,100
which means that it's a fuel produced 
from living organisms.

29
00:01:44,101 --> 00:01:47,760
In the case of America,
the majority of ethanol comes from corn.

30
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:48,623
The increase of demand for ethanol 
driven in part by US legislation to 

31
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:52,374
reduce air pollution has led to the 
widespread expansion of crop land to 

32
00:01:56,671 --> 00:01:57,504
produce more corn,
especially in the Midwest and Great 

33
00:01:59,431 --> 00:02:04,431
Plains right smack Dab in the middle of 
the monarch butterfly migration path.

34
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,860
Whoa.
The butterflies dude,

35
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,753
indigenous to North America and 
instantly recognizable to anyone who 

36
00:02:11,161 --> 00:02:12,750
lives here.
The monarch butterfly,

37
00:02:12,751 --> 00:02:13,584
it makes the longest and most 
spectacular migration of any insect in 

38
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:18,504
the world.
Every winter the monarch population 

39
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:23,070
flies 2,500
miles from its many homes in America and

40
00:02:23,071 --> 00:02:23,904
Canada to specific warm sites in Mexico 
and Southern California on the way it 

41
00:02:28,201 --> 00:02:32,940
lays eggs for the next generation,
but it can only lay them in one place.

42
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:34,043
Milkweed plant.
It's an odd feature of nature that 

43
00:02:35,431 --> 00:02:38,640
monarch larva eat milkweed leaves and 
nothing else,

44
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:40,890
but they do and as much as monarch 
larva.

45
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,010
Love that.
Milkweed farmers hate it.

46
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:47,790
It's a week we'd reduce yield and less 
yield means less money.

47
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:51,530
So in addition to clearing pristine 
lands in the great plains where milkweed

48
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,553
thrives,
farmers have increasingly adopted 

49
00:02:54,181 --> 00:02:58,710
genetically modified crops which are 
resistant to herbicides like roundup.

50
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:00,910
To introduce you to round up quick pro.

51
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,313
This product is produced by Monsanto.
It is a post emergent nonselective 

52
00:03:06,281 --> 00:03:07,330
herbicide.
Naturally,

53
00:03:07,331 --> 00:03:10,960
this poses a serious danger to the 
population of the monarch butterfly,

54
00:03:10,961 --> 00:03:15,961
which has fallen a mindblowing 90 
percent since its peak in 1996.

55
00:03:16,211 --> 00:03:20,080
The losses of milkweed are only part of 
the reason why the monarch population is

56
00:03:20,081 --> 00:03:20,914
crashing,
illegal deforestation of their winter 

57
00:03:22,601 --> 00:03:23,434
home in Mexico and a couple of years of 
bad weather have hurt their ability to 

58
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,990
make the long journey south and north 
again,

59
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,033
but even when conditions are right,
monarchs now have to fly farther and 

60
00:03:33,371 --> 00:03:37,840
longer to find places to lay their eggs.
Often they die before making it there.

61
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:40,900
No one is talking about the extinction 
of the monarch just yet,

62
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,800
but a 56 percent loss of monarch 
population in one year,

63
00:03:44,801 --> 00:03:45,634
2013 is nothing to sneeze at.
Both America and Mexico have pledged to 

64
00:03:49,301 --> 00:03:52,120
do what's necessary to save the monarch,
and if you want to help,

65
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,090
you can learn how to build butterfly 
gardens in your backyard.

66
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:58,750
I don't know about you,
but to me this is an amazing story.

67
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:03,160
A story of the unintended consequences 
of human action on earth.

68
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,023
Legislation passed in the US years ago 
to fight pollution has come to pose a 

69
00:04:08,051 --> 00:04:11,920
serious longterm threat to one of 
nature's loveliest creatures.

70
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,850
It's certainly a cliche to say 
everything in nature is connected,

71
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,193
but it is.
