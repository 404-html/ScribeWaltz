1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,060
They must goes into a podiatrist's 
office and the podiatry side that says,

2
00:00:05,221 --> 00:00:07,350
what's the problem?
And the mom says,

3
00:00:07,351 --> 00:00:09,690
what's the problem?
Where do I begin?

4
00:00:09,691 --> 00:00:10,524
Man?

5
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:11,383
Norm Mcdonald is one of those comedians 
who functions as a litmus test for 

6
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:18,290
people's sense of humor.
If you find norm hilarious,

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,320
for example,
I know that your sense of humor and mine

8
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:22,183
are probably pretty similar.
Norm splits people and if he does so 

9
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:26,024
more than most,
I think it's because his vision of 

10
00:00:27,741 --> 00:00:32,741
comedy is unflinching unflinchingly 
devoted to what he finds funny,

11
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,010
which means that he won't ever try to 
modify his work to appease an audience.

12
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:37,903
Of course,
this has led to what I think is the 

13
00:00:39,231 --> 00:00:40,064
mistaken notion,
one that you often see in youtube 

14
00:00:41,931 --> 00:00:45,320
comments that norm just doesn't care 
what people think

15
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:49,100
because I go to work for a gregory,
a linen,

16
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:52,490
which honestly I don't even know what 
I'm doing anymore.

17
00:00:52,491 --> 00:00:54,980
I don't even know if Gregory Olin 
Yvette's knows.

18
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:58,720
He only knows that he has power over me 
and that seems to bring up

19
00:00:58,970 --> 00:00:59,803
in us.
I think norm cares deeply about his 

20
00:01:01,671 --> 00:01:02,504
audiences.
He wouldn't spend thousands of hours 

21
00:01:04,131 --> 00:01:06,890
honing his material if you didn't want 
to make people laugh.

22
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:10,220
He just doesn't let the audience dictate
the direction of this work.

23
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,110
He doesn't pander.
In fact,

24
00:01:12,111 --> 00:01:15,110
during his time at snl as the host of 
weekend update,

25
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:16,213
he often did the exact opposite norms,
distaste for performing in front of an 

26
00:01:19,551 --> 00:01:22,010
audience that was essentially forced to 
laugh,

27
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:26,540
urged him to tell jokes that would shock
them into silence or gasps.

28
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:27,463
A decade before Ricky Gervais' made a 
splash by making fun of celebrities at 

29
00:01:30,111 --> 00:01:33,530
the Golden Globes norm hosted the sps 
with jokes.

30
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:34,893
Hey,
began the first defensive player to win 

31
00:01:36,201 --> 00:01:37,940
the heisman trophy,
and congratulations,

32
00:01:37,941 --> 00:01:38,774
Charles.
That is something that no one can ever 

33
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:43,340
take away from you unless you kill your 
wife later,

34
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,183
in which case

35
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,380
take bravery.
It takes dedication.

36
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:54,470
At night I sometimes wake up and I 
turned to some old lady in my bed that's

37
00:01:56,281 --> 00:01:59,650
on my arm,
a lady that I once loved duck.

38
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:04,470
I don't know where to turn to my 
youngest Alexandria.

39
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,270
She fell in the.
In the,

40
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,370
in the cold of last year.

41
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,293
Norms,
dedication to the craft is almost 

42
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:17,850
inhuman and so much of it is unseen.
He's one of the smartest,

43
00:02:17,851 --> 00:02:18,684
well-read people in stand up 
particularly well read in Russian 

44
00:02:20,671 --> 00:02:21,504
literature.
If you couldn't tell by the names that 

45
00:02:22,711 --> 00:02:23,544
he's making up in the mouth joke,
and yet his whole act is predicated on 

46
00:02:26,761 --> 00:02:28,950
this folksy,
dopey innocence.

47
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:33,090
He's like that magician from the 
prestige who devotes his whole life to a

48
00:02:33,091 --> 00:02:35,550
character just to pull off a great 
trick.

49
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:36,120
This

50
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:36,953
he's the truth.
This is one owner can detect this total 

51
00:02:42,721 --> 00:02:47,550
devotion to his own self sacrifice at my
other boy.

52
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,830
This is the hardest pill to swallow my 
after boy,

53
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:59,110
Greg Arrow.
Then a little

54
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,990
I no longer love him,
not trying to pull off tricks.

55
00:03:07,991 --> 00:03:12,370
Of course he's trying to pull off jokes,
a joke with a premise and the punchline,

56
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:15,310
it's kind of funny.
Norm was known for his super short jokes

57
00:03:15,311 --> 00:03:16,144
during this weekend update period and 
now he's known for these super long 

58
00:03:18,941 --> 00:03:22,120
rambling jokes that he often tells on 
late show appearances.

59
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,193
It's these longer jokes which bear a 
resemblance to shaggy dog stories that 

60
00:03:26,981 --> 00:03:30,830
often get him labeled as an anti comic 
or a medical clinic,

61
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:35,080
but he strongly insists that he is 
neither of these things in interviews.

62
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:38,560
Norm rejects anything that sees itself 
as above comedy.

63
00:03:38,561 --> 00:03:41,760
Looking down on it either to ridicule or
to comment.

64
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,400
His jokes always have punchlines.
Punchlines.

65
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,770
That makes sense.
Whether or not you think they're funny,

66
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:50,160
he can deliver a joke quickly.
Hey,

67
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:54,700
you know the funniest part of doing an 
office Congo line.

68
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:56,643
When you look back and realize they're 
doing it alone and you're not in an 

69
00:04:00,221 --> 00:04:01,054
office,
you're in a psychiatric hospital where 

70
00:04:03,431 --> 00:04:08,110
he can string out punchlines like pearls
on a wire across a long story.

71
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:11,920
This joke from his special me doing 
standup is 12 minutes long.

72
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:16,120
Seems like there's too much news because
now they have 24 hour news.

73
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,690
Now,
when I was a young boy,

74
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,850
the news was half a hour.
That was the whole.

75
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,713
It starts by talking about 24 hour news 
and eventually makes his way to a 

76
00:04:23,991 --> 00:04:28,160
detailed description of how he would 
murder someone and the progression.

77
00:04:28,161 --> 00:04:29,120
It's completely natural.

78
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:34,550
I would take her body to the woods and 
barrier in a very,

79
00:04:34,551 --> 00:04:38,110
very,
very deep grave along the way.

80
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:41,980
There was plenty of punchlines to laugh 
at and as things get crazier,

81
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:43,720
you get drawn into a kind of.

82
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:46,670
A lady has vanished cetera.
Fat.

83
00:04:46,671 --> 00:04:51,470
I'm Kinda happy it's Janice and not 
somebody I know to meet her one day.

84
00:04:51,471 --> 00:04:52,880
That would be a lot of fuck.
I forgot.

85
00:04:52,881 --> 00:04:57,881
She vanished time.
They will find you in a shallow grave.

86
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:03,430
Serial killers are supposed to be so 
shrewd and cunning and you know,

87
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:06,800
but then when it comes time for the 
grave,

88
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:09,690
it'll hasty.
You know,

89
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:14,030
what I would do is I would like,
I would look at the lay,

90
00:05:14,031 --> 00:05:16,880
I would select a lady and then I would 
follow her habits.

91
00:05:16,881 --> 00:05:17,714
You understand what I'm saying?
What would I be a holding in my right 

92
00:05:21,051 --> 00:05:23,990
hand in the parking lot,
but a cheese sandwich.

93
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,830
I got a whole fucking van full of,
um,

94
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:31,970
get in there and I would do that thing 
that makes me feel like God.

95
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:37,230
And then I would take her body to the 
woods and barrier in a very,

96
00:05:38,361 --> 00:05:40,490
very,
very deep brave,

97
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,540
which is have this joke is there if you 
want to look for it,

98
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,400
the word choices,
the freezing.

99
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:48,493
It's all precisely chosen,
but norm doesn't call attention to his 

100
00:05:50,971 --> 00:05:51,804
own intelligence.
The punchlines just appear like flashes 

101
00:05:54,451 --> 00:05:54,960
of light.

102
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,960
If only the cowardice was stronger than 
perhaps grabs I couldn't bring myself to

103
00:06:01,681 --> 00:06:05,130
reach over to that cocked and loaded gun
that lays on the bed.

104
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,660
And then this hellish facade,
one

105
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:15,960
constellation of comedy greats.
Norm is among the least famous,

106
00:06:15,961 --> 00:06:18,120
but he's also one of the most 
underrated.

107
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:19,283
That's because standup was never a 
stepping stone for him to greater 

108
00:06:21,871 --> 00:06:25,140
success or greater fame,
but an end in itself,

109
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:30,200
an art to perfect is kind of comedy is 
built to last like a low frequency noise

110
00:06:30,871 --> 00:06:34,950
that might not demand the same kind of 
attention is high pitch sounds,

111
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:38,100
but we'll travel a much greater distance
in the end.

112
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:41,610
Enormous jokes are the ones you'll 
remember latent to your life.

113
00:06:41,611 --> 00:06:42,444
The ones will all be telling for years 
to come because they're construction is 

114
00:06:45,721 --> 00:06:46,554
sophisticated,
but their delivery is easy to 

115
00:06:48,451 --> 00:06:49,284
understand.
Getting that balance exactly right is 

116
00:06:51,871 --> 00:06:52,704
the work of an entire career,
but norm mcdonald more than anyone else 

117
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,480
knows that a long winding journey is 
okay.

118
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,460
As long as the payoff is worth it.

119
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,373
It says dark because I feel like a 
spider even though I have a ma just 

120
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:16,540
barely hanging on to my web with 
everlasting fire underneath me,

121
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:21,070
I'm not feeling good and so the mice,
the director says,

122
00:07:21,071 --> 00:07:21,821
math,
man,

123
00:07:21,821 --> 00:07:26,320
you're a troubled but you shouldn't be 
seeing a psychiatrist.

124
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:29,560
Why on earth did you come here?
And then the Ma said,

125
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:34,920
because the light was on,
everybody's

126
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,040
eating so much for watching my episode 
on norm.
