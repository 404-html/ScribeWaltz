1
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:03,583
We have to admit there's something 
insidious and detestable about late 

2
00:00:06,771 --> 00:00:09,110
night television,
the kind of vicious circle.

3
00:00:09,111 --> 00:00:09,944
It's hard to realize until you actually 
go to a taping and the warmup comedian 

4
00:00:13,031 --> 00:00:17,330
gauges your laugh on a one to 10 volume 
scale and instructs you that you're only

5
00:00:17,331 --> 00:00:18,164
at about a seven and you need to keep it
up and turn it up for every little joke 

6
00:00:20,901 --> 00:00:21,734
you're about to see because the 
microphones are way up in the ceiling 

7
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:24,463
and they won't hear you otherwise.
It begins to dawn on you after about 10 

8
00:00:27,081 --> 00:00:27,914
cheerless guffaws that you came to the 
taping because you thought the show was 

9
00:00:31,521 --> 00:00:32,354
funny and you thought the show was funny
because all the jokes were followed by 

10
00:00:35,481 --> 00:00:36,314
maps and cheers and the lapse in cheers 
we're forced to make are what's causing 

11
00:00:40,371 --> 00:00:41,204
the audience at home.
To think the show is funny and it's why 

12
00:00:43,671 --> 00:00:45,380
they want to come to the taping 
themselves,

13
00:00:45,381 --> 00:00:48,650
which they do and they laugh and the 
cycle begins.

14
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:50,510
Again,
disappointing as this is.

15
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:51,523
It's also truly absurd.
A self generating observed that appears 

16
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:56,383
normal to us because it's all we know 
and if a really smart and innovative 

17
00:01:00,171 --> 00:01:01,004
comedian wanted to draw attention to the
normalization of this absurd American 

18
00:01:04,971 --> 00:01:05,804
ritual,
perhaps the first thing to do would be 

19
00:01:07,731 --> 00:01:11,840
to grab hold of the absurdity and turn 
it way.

20
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:13,063
Oh,
that's the biggest job I've ever seen 

21
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:30,403
and I don't think this is the right.
We're going to keep going with this and 

22
00:01:34,351 --> 00:01:37,960
we're going to see when we hit the 
pixelation,

23
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:50,840
the only unmarried looking for love life
was passing me by,

24
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:54,560
so I sent off my four two hobbies and 
age magazine,

25
00:01:54,561 --> 00:01:55,394
marriage.
I try to read his lovely Japanese girls 

26
00:01:58,611 --> 00:02:00,920
have been trained in the art of fees in 
men.

27
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:03,980
Be Lonely,
no more open destinies for $1.

28
00:02:03,981 --> 00:02:06,260
They arrange a meeting for 10 years

29
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,133
years.
The brilliant Craig Ferguson has lit a 

30
00:02:08,771 --> 00:02:11,020
fire from within the late night talk 
show universe.

31
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:13,720
Systematically deconstructing all its 
elements,

32
00:02:13,721 --> 00:02:16,540
whether it's the deferential sidekick,
the live band,

33
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:18,970
with the pre interview.
More than any,

34
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:22,060
the preinterview means nothing.
It means nothing.

35
00:02:22,061 --> 00:02:22,894
It's meaningless.
The pre interviews a formality like 

36
00:02:24,521 --> 00:02:25,354
wearing a tie or underpants,
it seemed like the biggest enemy to 

37
00:02:27,911 --> 00:02:28,744
Ferguson sense of comedy was the very 
foundation of late night TV structure 

38
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:33,913
itself.

39
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,150
Ferguson.

40
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:44,430
We sought out the unrehearsed,
the spontaneous.

41
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:46,560
He encouraged the awkward,
the weird,

42
00:02:46,561 --> 00:02:50,410
the difficult to know.
We should start rehearsing and recognize

43
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,263
and despise late nights deification of 
celebrity and took every opportunity to 

44
00:02:55,471 --> 00:02:56,930
mock us for buying into it.
I mean,

45
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,620
it's a short time on this planet,
man.

46
00:02:58,621 --> 00:02:59,950
It's a date and then a hyphen

47
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,440
and then another day and we have the 
hyphen and I'm like,

48
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,740
I'm not spending the whole time talking 
celebrities.

49
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,330
Now this isn't to say that

50
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:09,183
that hosts like Jimmy Fallon,
who I do like is somehow bankrupt 

51
00:03:11,861 --> 00:03:12,694
because all he does is pay homage to the
format by putting it in terms young 

52
00:03:16,181 --> 00:03:17,014
people of today can understand.
It's just that he and Ferguson sit at 

53
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:24,550
opposite ends of the spectrum or rather 
ferguson more than anyone else.

54
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,473
Willingly places himself outside the 
spectrum and his relationship to late 

55
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:32,950
night is an altogether different quality
or revolutionary one.

56
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:39,100
Americans not here.
You're going to lift the Dragon Tattoo.

57
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:42,843
The tension between

58
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:46,390
Ferguson and late night was what made 
Ferguson so funny.

59
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:49,480
His ability to express contempt for his 
position,

60
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,890
his network,
his job,

61
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:55,300
his willingness to admit his failures to
dwell on it was for many of us,

62
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:56,163
extremely liberating,
and that's because late night tv is a 

63
00:03:59,081 --> 00:04:01,120
fantasy,
a fantasy of sophistication,

64
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:04,600
charm and fun.
A standard to which after enough time we

65
00:04:04,601 --> 00:04:05,434
hold ourselves unwittingly.
No one knew this better than Craig 

66
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:12,490
Ferguson for 10 fucking awesome fucking 
weird years.

67
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,473
He tried to show us that life bears far 
less resemblance to a string of funny 

68
00:04:17,321 --> 00:04:22,150
stories than to the long awkward pauses 
that exists between,

69
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:51,390
well,
I hope we've done is.

70
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:56,250
It is maybe a to maybe art is a very 
grand word,

71
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,060
but,
but,

72
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:57,893
but what I was trying to do here and 
what I think that we've managed to do 

73
00:05:01,681 --> 00:05:02,514
here,

74
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:04,370
make something that wasn't here before

75
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,900
all I like,
I like chocolate milk.

76
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,620
Chocolate.
Dark chocolate is in.

77
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:13,540
You didn't lie.
You didn't want them.

78
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:14,783
You didn't want to.
Robot someone who creates them his own 

79
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:22,443
chocolate.
