1
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:13,963
Today I want to take a little bit of a 
closer look at a scene from Alfred 

2
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:17,443
Hitchcock's masterpiece vertigo.
It's an early scene in the movie when 

3
00:00:20,121 --> 00:00:20,954
the retired detective Scotty,
played by Jimmy Stewart visits an old 

4
00:00:23,601 --> 00:00:25,560
college friend,
Gavin elster.

5
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:28,573
Specifically,
I want to look at how hitchcock blocks 

6
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:35,770
this five minute and 22nd scene and how 
is staging of the characters adds to the

7
00:00:36,021 --> 00:00:36,854
story I married into it now.
I should say that there are two ways to 

8
00:00:39,561 --> 00:00:40,394
look at the scene from the perspective 
of a first time viewer who has to take 

9
00:00:42,981 --> 00:00:47,030
the information it presents at face 
value or from the perspective of someone

10
00:00:47,031 --> 00:00:47,864
who's already seen the film and knows 
the true intentions and outcomes of 

11
00:00:50,961 --> 00:00:51,794
what's revealed here.
I'm going to take a look at this from 

12
00:00:53,421 --> 00:00:54,254
the second perspective,
which means that there's going to be 

13
00:00:55,311 --> 00:00:56,930
spoilers,
so just a heads up,

14
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:01,280
so if you've seen vertigo,
you know that in this scene Gavin elster

15
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:02,143
is spinning and elaborate lie in order 
to create an alibi so that he can get 

16
00:01:06,021 --> 00:01:09,110
away with murdering his wife and his 
plan.

17
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:09,973
Scotty is the alibi.
Gavin tell Scotty that his wife has 

18
00:01:13,521 --> 00:01:17,270
possessed by an old spirit,
ask Scotty to spy on her,

19
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,433
then switches his wife out for an 
actress who plays that part cleverly 

20
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:24,650
exploiting Scotty's desire and his 
vertigo,

21
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:28,580
Gavin and the actress murder his wife 
and leave Scotty traumatized,

22
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:29,230
believing that

23
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:30,550
the wife committed suicide.

24
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:34,813
The scene in question,
the one in Gavin's office at his ship 

25
00:01:36,701 --> 00:01:37,534
building business,
comes only 11 minutes into the film and 

26
00:01:39,921 --> 00:01:43,880
comprises Gavin's attempt to learn 
Scotty into his deception.

27
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,580
How did you get in the shipbuilding 
business?

28
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,633
I'm married.

29
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:49,773
The scene starts with Gavin seated at 
his desk and Scotty standing behind a 

30
00:01:53,141 --> 00:01:55,450
chair in the center of the room.
In the beginning,

31
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,313
it's Scotty who's dominant.
He's asking questions moving around 

32
00:01:59,231 --> 00:02:00,064
Gavin's desk,
leisurely inspecting various objects 

33
00:02:02,531 --> 00:02:03,364
like a retired detective,
Mike by acting and sitting rather coyly 

34
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:10,540
Gavin lures.
Scotty into his space and his confidence

35
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,460
under the illusion of sincerity.

36
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,450
What was it like to hear?
How long have you been back?

37
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,273
Almost a year,

38
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:18,323
Scotty.
He continues his inspection moving to 

39
00:02:19,631 --> 00:02:22,810
the other side of the room to see an old
picture of San Francisco.

40
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:26,350
His back is turned just as Gavin makes a
key confession.

41
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,840
Yes,
I would like to live here.

42
00:02:27,841 --> 00:02:32,841
Then kinda excitement.
A freedom.

43
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:34,043
It's that freedom.
He desires freedom from his wife that's 

44
00:02:36,451 --> 00:02:37,284
launching this cruel plan.
Of course the audience can't know it 

45
00:02:40,021 --> 00:02:41,790
then,
but hitchcock's foreshadowing.

46
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,970
It's there and it's in the staging to 
while he sits.

47
00:02:44,971 --> 00:02:45,804
Gavin is in front of a window that shows
a shit behind being put together piece 

48
00:02:49,561 --> 00:02:50,394
by piece,
not unlike the story he's about to spin 

49
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,620
for.
Scotty.

50
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,370
Would you like a drink now?
No,

51
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:59,560
I don't think so.
A little early in the day for me.

52
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:00,503
Scotty moves toward Gavin again and sits
in the center chair asking him the 

53
00:03:04,261 --> 00:03:08,370
purpose of their meeting and hear the 
power changes hands.

54
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:09,383
As Scotty sits in the hot seat,
Gavin stands and begins to tell his 

55
00:03:13,591 --> 00:03:16,620
story.
He moves around the desk and up a couple

56
00:03:16,621 --> 00:03:19,470
of stairs so that he's towering over 
Scotty even higher.

57
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,230
I want you to follow my wife.
No,

58
00:03:22,231 --> 00:03:24,720
it's not.
They were very happily married.

59
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:27,450
Well,
I'm afraid to sound harsh.

60
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:31,080
May come to someone.
Did.

61
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,890
When Gavin makes his big reveal that his
wife is being supernaturally possessed,

62
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:36,873
hitchcock brings them in closer to 
Scotty so that the ankle is even more 

63
00:03:39,581 --> 00:03:40,414
extreme far now from being coy,
Gavin's blocking becomes aggressive and 

64
00:03:44,231 --> 00:03:45,064
the next thing that happens is perhaps 
the most interesting moment in the 

65
00:03:47,471 --> 00:03:48,304
scene.
Kevin and Scotty remain fixed in their 

66
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:51,064
positions,
but the camera dollies backwards to 

67
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:57,400
bring them both into frame.
Now the camera moves all over the scene,

68
00:03:57,401 --> 00:04:01,150
but this movement is the only that 
really calls attention to itself.

69
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:02,383
This is a reminder that for hitchcock 
blocking involves the position of the 

70
00:04:05,441 --> 00:04:08,260
camera too.
There are three elements in this scene,

71
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:12,430
not just to Scotty expresses his 
disbelief at the situation,

72
00:04:12,431 --> 00:04:15,190
and Gavin sitting again,
softer in tone,

73
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,780
acts like he understands.

74
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,480
Sorry,
I wasted your time.

75
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:20,670
Thanks for coming in.
And Scotty.

76
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:21,603
Scotty,
he gets up and moves toward the door to 

77
00:04:23,231 --> 00:04:24,064
leave.
Gavin lets this happen because he knows 

78
00:04:25,571 --> 00:04:27,580
that too.
Really Rope Scotty and he has to make it

79
00:04:27,581 --> 00:04:28,414
seem like it's his own choice.
Scotty apologizes and Gavin moves into 

80
00:04:32,201 --> 00:04:34,900
his space again and before Scotty can 
say anything,

81
00:04:34,901 --> 00:04:37,600
Gavin starts in on the details of his 
life,

82
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:40,810
how his wife seems to fade in and out of
her personality,

83
00:04:40,811 --> 00:04:45,811
how she wanders around to odd places and
Gavin himself is wandering in the second

84
00:04:45,971 --> 00:04:46,804
room which is raised a few steps like a 
stage and Scotty moves to the chair on 

85
00:04:51,281 --> 00:04:54,330
the opposite side,
like an audience member watching

86
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:55,243
his performance.
I've followed her one day wash check 

87
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:00,150
coming out of the apartment.
I went,

88
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:03,600
I didn't know even walked a different 
way.

89
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:08,790
Got into her car and drove out to golden
gate park.

90
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:12,840
Five months,
sat by the lake,

91
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:15,550
staring across the water,
the pillows,

92
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,160
the stand on the shore,
you know,

93
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:21,570
portals of the past.
Is there a long time without moving?

94
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,630
I had to leave.
Get back to the office.

95
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:28,200
When I got home that evening,
I asked her what she'd done all day.

96
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:32,520
She said she did not have to golden gate
park and sat by the lake.

97
00:05:32,521 --> 00:05:37,521
That's a speedometer on her car.
She that she drove 94 months.

98
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:41,983
Of course,
what Gavin is doing here isn't 

99
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,263
recounting details,
but planting them in Scotty's head 

100
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,473
details that will match with his 
actresses actions in the following 

101
00:05:50,121 --> 00:05:50,954
scenes.
This layer of stage performance is a 

102
00:05:53,361 --> 00:05:56,570
stroke of genius on Hitchcock's part 
because on one level,

103
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:00,980
vertigo is about the power of film and 
the power of narrative,

104
00:06:00,981 --> 00:06:04,160
how a really good narrative can 
manipulate us,

105
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,023
whether it's for the purposes of 
entertainment or something more 

106
00:06:07,131 --> 00:06:07,964
sinister.
The narrative laid out for Scotty in 

107
00:06:09,741 --> 00:06:12,260
this scene will drive the whole rest of 
the story.

108
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,153
It'll drive Scotty's actions in the 
first part of the film and eventually 

109
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:20,950
it'll drive his own obsessive narrative 
creation and the second part I've got to

110
00:06:20,951 --> 00:06:21,784
know this guy where she goes and what 
she does before I get involved with 

111
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:25,403
doctor.
Talked to the doctors at all are 

112
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,673
carefully.
When Gavin steps back down into the 

113
00:06:30,661 --> 00:06:31,494
lower room,
the monologue ends and the conversation 

114
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:34,863
resumed.

115
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:38,580
Scotty gets up from the chair to protest
Gavin's request for help,

116
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,833
but he's moving toward him.
Gavin mirrors his movement and 

117
00:06:42,061 --> 00:06:44,280
approaches Scotty entering his space 
again.

118
00:06:44,281 --> 00:06:47,430
This time with his final barking,
a simple request.

119
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,470
We're going to an opening of the opera 
tonight with dining into Annie's.

120
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:53,940
First.
You can see how then the scene ends with

121
00:06:53,941 --> 00:06:58,500
Gavin literally leaning into Scotty and 
Scotty finally relenting.

122
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,650
The trap has been set.
Hitchcock even frames it so that the two

123
00:07:01,651 --> 00:07:02,484
are overlapping.
I've always loved the scene in Vertigo 

124
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:06,323
in college.
I used to diagram it out in my 

125
00:07:07,771 --> 00:07:08,604
notebooks,
trying to figure out where he put the 

126
00:07:09,901 --> 00:07:10,734
camera on what lenses he used,
but it's the blocking for these five 

127
00:07:13,831 --> 00:07:17,910
continuous minutes that are the real 
mark of hitchcock's mastery of the form.

128
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:22,500
The scene is small and often overlooked,
but it holds up the rest of the film.

129
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:23,543
How many other directors could 
choreograph this conversation in such a 

130
00:07:26,161 --> 00:07:26,994
way that it works like a dance where one
man is leading and performing and the 

131
00:07:31,171 --> 00:07:34,370
other is a spectator and a patsy without
knowing it.

132
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:39,380
Yet both Gavin elster and this scene 
have hitchcock written all over them.

133
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,713
In other words,
I don't think it's a coincidence that 

134
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:46,490
the man himself isn't too far away.

135
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,690
Hey everybody.
Thanks for watching.

136
00:07:57,691 --> 00:07:58,524
I really did diagram the scene in my 
college notebooks and I encourage you 

137
00:08:01,591 --> 00:08:04,540
guys to pick out a favorite scene of 
yours with complicated blocking and,

138
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:07,050
and do the same.
I think it can be really illuminating.

139
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:08,123
Um,
thanks to squarespace for sponsoring
