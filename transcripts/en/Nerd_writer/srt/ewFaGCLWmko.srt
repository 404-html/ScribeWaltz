1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,970
Oh,
coffee on a Tuesday in 19

2
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,090
the pole j Getty Museum in Los Angeles 
is beautiful,

3
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,030
not only for the breathtaking artifacts 
and it's large collection,

4
00:00:24,031 --> 00:00:28,050
but for the palatial architecture and 
for the experience of going there to the

5
00:00:28,051 --> 00:00:28,884
top of that mountain and a trolley car 
above the city from some of its 

6
00:00:31,471 --> 00:00:32,304
balconies.
You can see the entirety of greater Los 

7
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:35,890
Angeles sat beneath its film,
move,

8
00:00:35,891 --> 00:00:37,950
smug,
and you can see the ocean and the West.

9
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:39,053
It's gardens or tranquil.
You can sit on the grass and enjoy the 

10
00:00:41,131 --> 00:00:44,880
day and then it's back down the trolley 
and you feel educated,

11
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:45,743
cultured better for the experience.
The next morning over coffee and you 

12
00:00:48,451 --> 00:00:49,284
read in the paper that archeological 
sites in Iraq have been ravaged by 

13
00:00:51,991 --> 00:00:52,824
looters who have sunk holes into the 
dirt and rip thousands of year old 

14
00:00:55,891 --> 00:00:56,724
artifacts from the ground to sell them 
on the market for cat still fresh from 

15
00:00:59,761 --> 00:01:00,510
your trip to the getty.

16
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:01,343
Your newfound sense of culture is 
outraged by such disregard for history 

17
00:01:04,621 --> 00:01:05,454
and you begin to think of those 
artifacts you saw yesterday in the 

18
00:01:06,751 --> 00:01:09,510
museum as the luckiest orphans in the 
world.

19
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,550
Thank God for museums.
You say,

20
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:12,413
thank God for the getty.
Here's the essential problem of the 

21
00:01:14,191 --> 00:01:15,024
antiquities market.
On the one side you have leaders who 

22
00:01:16,261 --> 00:01:17,094
everybody hates,
and on the other side you have museums 

23
00:01:18,151 --> 00:01:18,984
which everybody loves.
It's hard to see at first glance that 

24
00:01:21,121 --> 00:01:23,520
these two things are unavoidably 
connected.

25
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:24,390
See looters,
Luke,

26
00:01:24,391 --> 00:01:25,224
because there's money in it.
These are poor people and they need to 

27
00:01:27,091 --> 00:01:28,170
feed their families.
Okay,

28
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,090
so let's say that it circulates around 
the village,

29
00:01:30,091 --> 00:01:30,924
that there is a man entailed,
willing to pay good money for Sumerian 

30
00:01:34,081 --> 00:01:35,550
cylinder,
seals from the Babylonian era,

31
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,490
and the guy next door knows exactly 
where to find them.

32
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:39,443
Well,
our would be luder travels with his 

33
00:01:40,981 --> 00:01:43,710
neighbor in the middle of the night to 
the chosen archaeological site and sinks

34
00:01:43,711 --> 00:01:46,830
holes into the ground looking for 
Sumerian cylinder seals.

35
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:47,663
He doesn't find anything for awhile.
Eventually he comes upon a pocket of 

36
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:51,444
them.
Now his shovel has smashed five beyond 

37
00:01:53,131 --> 00:01:53,964
all recognition,
but two are still intact even in good 

38
00:01:56,341 --> 00:01:57,174
condition,
and this will feed his family for a 

39
00:01:58,981 --> 00:01:59,814
month.
So he goes to town and seeks the buyer 

40
00:02:00,901 --> 00:02:01,734
out.
Now he pays a little bit less than was 

41
00:02:02,971 --> 00:02:03,804
reported,
but beggars can't be choosers and this 

42
00:02:05,281 --> 00:02:06,114
is his first time.
Now the buyer is excited because these 

43
00:02:07,591 --> 00:02:08,424
cylinder seals are very hot right now 
among private collectors and he expects 

44
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:12,923
a good turnover from here.
The cylinder seals run a complicated 

45
00:02:14,911 --> 00:02:15,744
route of buyers and sellers and 
smugglers and dealers across oceans and 

46
00:02:18,331 --> 00:02:19,164
international borders.
Maybe staying awhile in the Geneva 

47
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:24,900
freeport where storage items are exempt 
from customs regulations,

48
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,120
you know,
just to keep a low profile.

49
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,980
It's an almost impossible route to 
follow.

50
00:02:28,981 --> 00:02:29,814
An antiquities dealers are very good at 
confusing the authorities who mostly 

51
00:02:32,251 --> 00:02:35,100
stay five steps behind and out of 
jurisdiction.

52
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:36,030
Eventually,
those very,

53
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:39,390
very old Sumerian cylinder seals will 
end up in one of two places.

54
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,790
Private collections or museum.
Why?

55
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:42,630
Well,
because like I said,

56
00:02:42,631 --> 00:02:46,830
those seals are very hot right now and 
in an estimated $4,000,000,000

57
00:02:46,831 --> 00:02:49,740
a year.
Industry hot is really.

58
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:51,510
Yes,
the dealer is fooled the authorities,

59
00:02:51,511 --> 00:02:52,344
but it's small potatoes.
When you consider how much they fooled 

60
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,073
us,
see the whole thing can be boiled down 

61
00:02:56,221 --> 00:03:00,250
to a simple business model.
Supply and demand without demand.

62
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,113
There is no supply and so museums like 
the getty in Los Angeles where the met 

63
00:03:04,241 --> 00:03:05,074
in New York City or the MFA in Boston 
can go on demanding elicit artifacts 

64
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:11,800
because most people don't realize that 
this causes this.

65
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,840
It's why when people like Philippe de 
Montebello,

66
00:03:13,841 --> 00:03:15,850
the former director of the met say 
things like,

67
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,710
we're lucky,
allergist abandoned the shivering orphan

68
00:03:17,711 --> 00:03:19,390
child on a cold,
rainy day in the street.

69
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,500
Defense,
defensive their practices,

70
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:22,450
we can call a big bullshit.

71
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,130
These people are the parents orphaning 
their children off the metaphor.

72
00:03:27,131 --> 00:03:27,964
It isn't really.
It was Montebello in 2006 who had to 

73
00:03:29,441 --> 00:03:30,274
return the fame Euphronios Krater to 
Italy after it was shown to have had 

74
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,140
been clearly alluded from a tomb and 
secretary.

75
00:03:35,141 --> 00:03:35,974
He later said,
how much more could you learn from 

76
00:03:37,061 --> 00:03:39,130
knowing which particular hole that came 
out of?

77
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,233
Well,
this just shows you how ignorant these 

78
00:03:41,831 --> 00:03:44,590
people really are.
As the answer to his question is,

79
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,360
of course,
virtually every.

80
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:48,670
There's an archeological term called 
provenience.

81
00:03:48,671 --> 00:03:49,504
It means the location of an object in 
three dimensional space in relation to 

82
00:03:52,241 --> 00:03:53,074
all the things around it.
Another word would be context and 

83
00:03:55,211 --> 00:03:56,044
objects for tells us 99 percent of the 
information about its significance and 

84
00:03:58,901 --> 00:03:59,734
use.
It's why archeologists use all those 

85
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,700
little tools to dig things up to 
preserve the provenience.

86
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:04,840
Okay,
so an example.

87
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:05,683
If a Roman coin was found by a 
snorkelers off the coast of Alexandria 

88
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,513
and sold to museum,
the experts there could probably tell 

89
00:04:11,561 --> 00:04:15,310
you a lot about what year it was made 
and what meant it came from even in.

90
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:17,260
That's a nice amount of superficial 
information.

91
00:04:17,261 --> 00:04:18,094
Let's say the circle or didn't touch the
coin and instead reported the fine will 

92
00:04:20,321 --> 00:04:21,154
archeologists searching the area,
then find many more coins and not only 

93
00:04:23,531 --> 00:04:26,620
can they tell you about the year that it
was made in the mint that it came from,

94
00:04:26,621 --> 00:04:27,454
but they can start to tell you a new 
story about the shipping trade in the 

95
00:04:30,851 --> 00:04:33,910
Roman era.
Mediterranean Sea context is everything.

96
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,070
The aim of archeology is to tell the 
most true,

97
00:04:36,071 --> 00:04:36,904
most comprehensive story about the past,
under the assumption that both the past 

98
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:43,030
and the truth are worth something to.
In 2007,

99
00:04:43,031 --> 00:04:43,864
the getty returned 40 artifacts to Italy
under mounting pressure from 

100
00:04:45,851 --> 00:04:46,684
international authorities.
Now they did it quietly and without 

101
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:49,653
admitting wrongdoing,
but these repatriations are becoming 

102
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:52,624
more to stop the supply.
You have to choke the demand and to do 

103
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:58,720
that you have to educate people about 
how the antiquities market really works.

104
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,553
You have to show them how they are being
fooled by palatial architecture and 

105
00:05:01,751 --> 00:05:02,584
great presentation.
You have to say to them that though 

106
00:05:03,851 --> 00:05:04,684
these places are undeniably beautiful,
sitting as they do on the top of 

107
00:05:07,121 --> 00:05:07,954
mountains above the city,
that there are cultures being destroyed 

108
00:05:10,361 --> 00:05:11,194
and forgotten every day and they had 
their own ideas about architecture and 

109
00:05:14,321 --> 00:05:15,154
presentation in beauty.
Don't you think that their ideas in our 

110
00:05:17,921 --> 00:05:20,410
culture has a right to be remembered 
correctly?

111
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:23,260
High nerd writer here,
this is my friend Sam.

112
00:05:23,261 --> 00:05:25,030
He just finished making a World War II 
short,

113
00:05:25,031 --> 00:05:25,864
epic called the American starring made.
You want to check it out and I suggest 

114
00:05:28,631 --> 00:05:30,130
that you do it because it is pretty 
fucking awesome.

115
00:05:30,131 --> 00:05:33,790
You can find that link in the doodly.
Do anything to add Sam.
