1
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:06,660
Universities are often cited as 
mythologies of the modern era,

2
00:00:06,661 --> 00:00:08,060
Superman,
spiderman,

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:08,970
wonder woman,
and the hulk.

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:14,210
These are the new gods,
the site and Apollo Zeus of our debt,

5
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:19,050
but the strongest similarities between 
Greek myth and American comics have less

6
00:00:19,051 --> 00:00:19,884
to do with the characters or their 
supernatural powers than with an ever 

7
00:00:24,151 --> 00:00:29,151
growing interweaving tapestry of story.
There will be very little force,

8
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:30,203
for example,
in escalas is Oresteia the story of 

9
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:33,624
arrestees revenge on his mother 
Clytemnestra murder of her husband 

10
00:00:36,481 --> 00:00:37,314
agamemnon arrestees father.
If the story of Agamemnon had not 

11
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:41,303
already been told in homer's Iliad,
the dark family history of Agamemnon is 

12
00:00:45,571 --> 00:00:49,170
assumed in escalates.
His tragedy all at symbolisms of rape,

13
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:53,370
murder and incest.
Augment the RSD is expansion of it.

14
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:57,240
That same idea goes for Frank Miller's.
The dark knight returns,

15
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,350
the new orange tail of a geriatric 
Batman coming out of retirement.

16
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,213
Miller drew on what was then 48 years of
Batman stories from Bob Kane to Dennis 

17
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,260
O'neil from sixties camp to seventies,
brooding.

18
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,153
All of it informs the Dark Knight 
returns introspective depiction of a 

19
00:01:14,281 --> 00:01:16,950
beast at war with the man who embodies 
them,

20
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:17,813
both stories,
drug depth from the narrative universes 

21
00:01:20,041 --> 00:01:20,874
to which they belong,
more depth in either could achieve 

22
00:01:22,441 --> 00:01:23,274
alone,
and the stories that came after use 

23
00:01:25,381 --> 00:01:28,950
these in the same way.
This is a unique feature of mythology.

24
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:32,100
Every story lends special weight to 
every other.

25
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:35,340
Shared characters develop a life's worth
of pain,

26
00:01:35,341 --> 00:01:36,510
triumph,
anxiety,

27
00:01:36,511 --> 00:01:38,550
affection,
and as the tapper street grows,

28
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,240
larger and tighter,
individual threads become more sensitive

29
00:01:42,241 --> 00:01:43,074
to effects on others and the whole.
It's why we keep returning to Greek 

30
00:01:45,811 --> 00:01:48,570
myth.
It's why we love comic books and when it

31
00:01:48,571 --> 00:01:49,404
comes to film,
Marvel comics understands with ironman 

32
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,940
the incredible hulk captain America,
the first Avenger and thor marvel rolled

33
00:01:56,941 --> 00:01:57,774
out and incredible and incredibly 
successful campaign to entwine it's 

34
00:02:01,771 --> 00:02:04,140
heroes world.
The first phase,

35
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:06,030
as they called it,
featured origin stories.

36
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:06,863
Unnecessary hurdle.
Average filmgoers weren't familiar with 

37
00:02:09,091 --> 00:02:09,924
thor or ironman.
Then with the groundwork laid in a 

38
00:02:12,001 --> 00:02:12,834
number of hints that something bigger 
was on the way marvel studios delivered 

39
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:19,890
the avengers,
the first shared universe comic film.

40
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:24,070
It's hard to overstate the impact of 
this under the guidance of Sweden.

41
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:24,963
The avengers came off beautifully,
but the real payoff was next with iron 

42
00:02:29,061 --> 00:02:29,894
man,
three marvel released a film in which 

43
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:36,590
the facts of a shared universe fed back 
and added special way to Tony Stark's,

44
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,890
new life and story.
It's something more than sql.

45
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:40,853
It's something that's never been done 
before and Phil compared to this DC 

46
00:02:44,851 --> 00:02:45,684
comics heroes are hopelessly alone.
They exist awkwardly on separate film 

47
00:02:50,101 --> 00:02:52,080
islands.
Superman doesn't know Batman,

48
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:52,921
Greenland,
or does it.

49
00:02:52,921 --> 00:02:55,800
No wonder woman or Martian manhunter or 
Aquaman.

50
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:56,663
Nobody knows the flash.
Christopher Nolan did a superb job with 

51
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:02,170
Batman begins and the dark night,
but he's got them.

52
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:07,170
City has no sister in metropolis.
Every hero is the first of its kind.

53
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:08,043
Hopefully the upcoming superman versus 
Batman movie is assigned that DC 

54
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,610
starting to get its act together.
Of course,

55
00:03:12,611 --> 00:03:15,040
Dave Cast Ben Affleck,
but that's another story.

56
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,530
There were even rumors that a Justice 
League movie,

57
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:20,590
the superior analog of the avengers,
in my opinion,

58
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:25,330
is in the cars for 2017 fingers and toes
crossed.

59
00:03:25,331 --> 00:03:28,360
Who knows what phase marvel will be in.
By then,

60
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:31,120
the stories can only get deeper and more
complex.

61
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:31,983
It's a big production to fold directors 
and actors and writers into a shared 

62
00:03:36,071 --> 00:03:36,904
universe,
but it's worth all that trouble if the 

63
00:03:38,861 --> 00:03:43,810
product is a whole new class of cinema.
Hey everybody.

64
00:03:43,811 --> 00:03:47,020
Thanks for watching.
I'm a huge comic Book Fan and Comic Book

65
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:47,853
Movie Fan.
You might know that from some previous 

66
00:03:48,641 --> 00:03:52,300
videos on the DC person.
I've always read DC comics.

67
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,400
Superman has been my favorite superhero 
forever,

68
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:59,401
so it's so painful to watch what DC is 
doing in their film universe,

69
00:03:59,801 --> 00:04:04,801
especially giving Zack Snyder the reigns
to superman and Batman and it just,

70
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,570
it it.
It pains me a lot.

71
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:10,960
If you have an idea for a topic you'd 
like me to cover a write in the comments

72
00:04:10,961 --> 00:04:13,360
and also I love your comments.
Keep commenting.

73
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:14,403
I'm.
I'm going to try to respond to as many 

74
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,050
as I can.
Hopefully I can do all of them.

75
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,990
Thanks for watching and I'll see you 
next time.
