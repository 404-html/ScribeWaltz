1
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,720
With all the excitement surrounding the 
2008 election,

2
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:13,583
it might be surprising to learn that 
only 56 point nine percent of eligible 

3
00:00:17,701 --> 00:00:20,130
citizens a little over half the 
population,

4
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:22,980
it turned out to vote that year.
That's pretty bad,

5
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:27,210
but at least it was a few points better 
than 2012 and this kind of voter turnout

6
00:00:27,211 --> 00:00:30,000
puts us pretty low on the list of 
developed countries,

7
00:00:30,001 --> 00:00:30,834
which is not something to be proud of,
but it also means that voter 

8
00:00:33,781 --> 00:00:37,590
mobilization efforts have the potential 
to yield massive results.

9
00:00:37,591 --> 00:00:38,520
I mean,
for example,

10
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:42,510
Romney only lost to Obama by 5 million 
votes last time.

11
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,553
It's a pretty small number compared to 
the $112 million still up for grabs and 

12
00:00:47,801 --> 00:00:48,634
get out the vote.
Campaigns come in a few different 

13
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,233
varieties.
The most inane and probably the least 

14
00:00:53,461 --> 00:00:54,294
effective is that kind work.
Leonardo Dicaprio in a laundry list of 

15
00:00:57,001 --> 00:01:00,000
other celebrities command you to vote 
from the TV.

16
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:00,781
I mean,
seriously,

17
00:01:00,781 --> 00:01:03,360
after all this,
after this whole video,

18
00:01:03,361 --> 00:01:06,090
if you're not going to vote,
I don't even know what the sad anymore.

19
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:06,901
Wow.
Leo,

20
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:11,730
that really hurts even self-aware and 
comedic campaigns in this vein,

21
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,730
like the one just Sweden made earlier 
this year like lead,

22
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:15,573
don't move the needle all that much 
because they rely on old fashioned 

23
00:01:18,751 --> 00:01:19,584
techniques,
namely a handful of righteous messages 

24
00:01:21,811 --> 00:01:25,950
that include things like it's your 
responsibility to vote for your voice,

25
00:01:25,951 --> 00:01:29,910
won't be heard otherwise,
or it's historic and slash or really,

26
00:01:29,911 --> 00:01:31,950
really close election.
The while,

27
00:01:31,951 --> 00:01:34,080
these are all really good reasons to 
vote.

28
00:01:34,081 --> 00:01:38,970
They all operate under the assumption of
a behavioral theory called rational self

29
00:01:38,971 --> 00:01:42,870
interest for decades and decades.
People assume that if social norms about

30
00:01:42,871 --> 00:01:43,704
voting,
we're heavily reinforced like they are 

31
00:01:45,211 --> 00:01:48,540
in those ads,
then people would just comply to satisfy

32
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:51,450
their sense of civic duty.
Unfortunately,

33
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,313
when put to the test,
these techniques came up way short than 

34
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:54,930
a landmark.

35
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:55,763
Two thousand eight paper from Gerber 
Green and larimer extensive studies 

36
00:01:58,471 --> 00:01:59,304
found that theories based on rational 
self interested behavior generally fail 

37
00:02:02,771 --> 00:02:06,360
to predict significant turnout.
This goes for celebrities talking to you

38
00:02:06,361 --> 00:02:09,060
through the TV or online,
as well as phone banks,

39
00:02:09,061 --> 00:02:11,250
direct mail,
or door to door canvasing.

40
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,280
The problem is that plenty of people 
tell you they're going to vote,

41
00:02:14,281 --> 00:02:17,460
but don't actually do so when the time 
comes,

42
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:18,653
but behavioral research can offer us 
some tricks to help study show for 

43
00:02:21,421 --> 00:02:22,254
example,
that if you ask people about their 

44
00:02:23,581 --> 00:02:24,414
specific plan,
ask them where they're voting or how 

45
00:02:26,401 --> 00:02:27,234
they're going to get there.
You could double or triple your 

46
00:02:28,861 --> 00:02:30,120
effectiveness.
Also,

47
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:30,983
campaigners often tell people that every
vote counts more when there's a low 

48
00:02:34,231 --> 00:02:37,050
turnout,
so their vote is extra important,

49
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:38,243
but the research shows that people are 
more likely to vote if they think 

50
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:42,480
there's going to be a high turnout.

51
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,840
In other words,
if everyone else is doing it too.

52
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,873
Okay,
but what if you really wanted to boost 

53
00:02:49,201 --> 00:02:50,034
the vote?
Is there anything that would motivate 

54
00:02:51,481 --> 00:02:54,030
people in a really big way?
Well,

55
00:02:54,031 --> 00:02:54,864
let's go back to that paper from Gerber 
Green and Larabar because I think it's 

56
00:02:57,481 --> 00:02:58,314
really fascinating what they did.
They basically conducted a large scale 

57
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,133
field experiment where they mailed out 
letters to four different groups of 

58
00:03:04,961 --> 00:03:08,530
people.
The first was a standard campaign mailer

59
00:03:08,531 --> 00:03:09,364
that said,
do your civic duty vote basically like 

60
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:15,790
those commercials who were looking at 
the second inform people that they would

61
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:18,970
be confidentially studying voter turnout
for the election.

62
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,073
Now,
let me just pause here to say something 

63
00:03:21,521 --> 00:03:26,500
that you may not know in America,
everyone's voting record.

64
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,030
It's public.
Now,

65
00:03:28,031 --> 00:03:31,510
don't freak out because you can't find 
out who people voted for,

66
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,390
only if they voted or not.
In fact,

67
00:03:34,391 --> 00:03:35,224
in the third meal or the researchers did
just that they mailed people their own 

68
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:40,690
voting record from the past two 
elections.

69
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:45,930
Looks like Robert Wayne wasn't able to 
make it out there in 2004 and the fourth

70
00:03:45,971 --> 00:03:46,804
mailer,
and this is where it gets really 

71
00:03:47,921 --> 00:03:50,290
interesting,
takes it one step further.

72
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:53,530
Not only did they send out people's 
voting records,

73
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:54,873
but they also included the voting 
records of their neighbor so that 

74
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,620
everyone could see who voted and who 
didn't.

75
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,450
Now,
while the turnout of the first group,

76
00:04:01,451 --> 00:04:03,670
the group who got the regular mailer 
raised,

77
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,593
one point eight percentage points,
turnout in the last group increased by 

78
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:08,943
eight point one percentage points,
which is a huge increase and it makes 

79
00:04:13,331 --> 00:04:15,580
sense.
I wouldn't want to be the only one on my

80
00:04:15,581 --> 00:04:16,414
block who didn't vote.
Now I'm not saying this is the right 

81
00:04:19,121 --> 00:04:20,890
thing to do.
It's probably not,

82
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:21,933
but imagine if facebook told you that it
was instituting a flair on your avatar 

83
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:29,980
after the election based on the public 
record that simply said,

84
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:33,580
voted something that you didn't have to 
put up if you didn't want to,

85
00:04:33,581 --> 00:04:34,414
but couldn't put up if you didn't vote 
or imagine if it just put a big didn't 

86
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,183
vote after someone's saying,
I bet you'd see a pretty significant 

87
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,170
increase in voting across the board.

88
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:45,723
Now I realized that shaming people is 
probably not the best motivator and 

89
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:52,840
researchers found that this method did 
receive a fair amount of backlash,

90
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:53,823
but it is interesting to think about 
voter participation is something that 

91
00:04:56,561 --> 00:04:57,394
concerns all of us because only about 
half of Americans vote every four years 

92
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,110
and far fewer at local elections in 
between.

93
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:06,003
I mean,
just imagine if the over 100 million 

94
00:05:07,871 --> 00:05:10,420
people who don't vote could be motivated
to do so.

95
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:15,930
The political landscape that everyone 
seems to be so tired of could be totally

96
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:17,880
transformed,
but you know,

97
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:19,720
don't take it from me.
I mean,

98
00:05:19,721 --> 00:05:21,040
seriously,
after all this,

99
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:23,750
after this whole video,
if you're not going to run,

100
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:25,480
I don't even know what to say to you 
anymore.

101
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,270
There is a new nerve writer video every 
Wednesdays.

102
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,110
Be in that box right there.
You know what?

103
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:34,280
Forget about this.
Can you see it as Florence,

104
00:05:34,281 --> 00:05:36,050
Italy and it's the most beautiful thing 
I've ever seen.

105
00:05:36,051 --> 00:05:37,390
I'm here with my parents today,
Hon.

106
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,510
sorry.
The videos had been late.

107
00:05:38,511 --> 00:05:41,630
I just spent so much here to Italy.
It's been so amazing.

108
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:42,943
Anyway,
I have to think squarespace for 

109
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,720
