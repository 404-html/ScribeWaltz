1
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:08,053
Me,

2
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:18,290
my heart aches and a drowsy,
numbness,

3
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,133
pains,
my sense of him like I had drunk and 

4
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,193
emptied some dough opiate to the drains 
in one minute past leafy words had some 

5
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:30,983
is that through envy of buy happy lot,
but being too happy and nine happiness 

6
00:00:34,031 --> 00:00:38,770
the Dow light when you're dry out of the
trees in some melodious plot of beach in

7
00:00:38,771 --> 00:00:40,250
green and shadows.
Number list,

8
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,900
singer stuff.
Summer in full throated ease.

9
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:48,963
Oh,
for drafting vintage that has been 

10
00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:55,951
cooled along age and the deep delving.
Earth tasting of flora in the country.

11
00:00:56,441 --> 00:00:57,970
Green,
dense and prevent style,

12
00:00:57,971 --> 00:01:01,020
song and sunburnt mirth.
Oh,

13
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,890
for beaker,
full of the warm south,

14
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,630
full of the truth,
the blush,

15
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:05,464
full hypocretin with beaded bubbles 
winking at the brim and purples stated 

16
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,040
mouth that I might drink and leave the 
world unseen and with the fade away into

17
00:01:17,471 --> 00:01:18,304
the forest and fade faraway dissolve and
quite forget what thou among the leads 

18
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:29,590
has never known the weariness,
the fever,

19
00:01:29,591 --> 00:01:32,260
and the fret here where men sit and hear
each other grown.

20
00:01:32,261 --> 00:01:33,094
We're posey shakes.
A few sad last gray hair is where youth 

21
00:01:37,151 --> 00:01:37,984
grows pale and specter thin and dyes 
were but to think is to be full of 

22
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:49,573
sorrows and let denied despairs where 
beauty cannot keep her less resize or 

23
00:01:56,261 --> 00:01:57,094
new love pine at them beyond tomorrow,
away away for I will fly with the nut 

24
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,860
charioted by back,
sent his parts,

25
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:06,903
but on the swings of Posey,
though the Dole brain perplexes and 

26
00:02:09,851 --> 00:02:10,684
retards already with the tender is the 
night and happily the queen moon is on 

27
00:02:14,711 --> 00:02:17,650
her throne,
clustered around by all her story phase,

28
00:02:17,651 --> 00:02:22,651
but here there is no light.
Say what?

29
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:25,743
From heaviness,
with the reasons blown through virtuous 

30
00:02:26,981 --> 00:02:28,540
glooms and winding Masi ways,

31
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:36,670
I cannot see what flowers are at my 
feet,

32
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:39,820
nor what soft incense hangs upon the 
bowels,

33
00:02:39,821 --> 00:02:40,654
but in embalmment darkness,
guests each suite where with the 

34
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:45,880
seasonable month endows the grass,
the thicket,

35
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,103
and the fruit tree,
wild white Hawthorne in the pastoral 

36
00:02:48,611 --> 00:02:50,200
Eggland time,
fast fading,

37
00:02:50,201 --> 00:02:53,080
Violet's covered up and leaves and mid 
maze.

38
00:02:53,081 --> 00:02:56,650
Eldest child,
the coming must gross full of do we wind

39
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,470
murmurs,
haunt flies on summaries.

40
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:14,140
Darkling.
I listened for many a time.

41
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,210
I have been half in love with easeful 
death

42
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,760
called him names and many amused Ryan to
take into the air.

43
00:03:27,731 --> 00:03:28,564
My quiet breath now more than ever.
Seems it rich today to cease upon the 

44
00:03:33,161 --> 00:03:33,994
midnight with no pain.
Well that are pouring for thei soul 

45
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:39,063
abroad in such an ecstasy still would've
stopped soon and I had ears in vain to 

46
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:55,200
high requiem become a site that was not 
born for death.

47
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,580
Mortal Bird,
no hung regenerations tread the down.

48
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:03,650
The same voice I hear this passing night
was heard in ancient days by emperor and

49
00:04:03,651 --> 00:04:04,484
clown,
perhaps the self same song that found a 

50
00:04:05,931 --> 00:04:08,600
path through the sad part of ruth when 
sick for home.

51
00:04:08,601 --> 00:04:13,601
She stood in tears amid the alien core 
in the same that oftentimes have charmed

52
00:04:13,671 --> 00:04:18,671
magic casements opening on the foam of 
perilous seas in fairy lands for Lauren.

53
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:35,110
Very word.
He's like a bell to tow me back from the

54
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,450
to my soul self.

55
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:40,043
Do you

56
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:44,390
the fancy cannot cheat so well as she 
has failed to do deceiving.

57
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:46,880
Uh,
do you?

58
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,290
Uh,
do you buy plaintiff?

59
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:51,320
Anthem fades past the near meadows,
over the stream,

60
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:52,243
up the hillside.
And now is buried deep in the next 

61
00:04:54,951 --> 00:04:55,784
valley glade.

62
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:02,663
Was it division

63
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:10,190
or a waking dream?
Flood.

64
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,153
Is that music?

65
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,600
Do I wake or sleep.
