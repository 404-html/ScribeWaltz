1
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:03,750
Well,
I have 20 minutes to five.

2
00:00:03,751 --> 00:00:08,751
We can now say the decision taken in 
1975 by this country to join.

3
00:00:08,941 --> 00:00:13,941
The common market has been reversed by 
this referendum to leave the EU.

4
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:19,430
You know whether you think brexit is a 
good or a bad idea at this point.

5
00:00:19,431 --> 00:00:20,264
One thing is beyond doubt.
It's an idea whose time has come to the 

6
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:30,610
independent United Kingdom.
This isn't something that just happened.

7
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:31,753
What the world witness last Friday was 
the culmination of a pressure movement 

8
00:00:34,341 --> 00:00:35,174
that started over 20 years ago,
a movement that has evolved and evolved 

9
00:00:38,871 --> 00:00:39,704
across the years and bite it.
It's time exploiting every national and 

10
00:00:42,711 --> 00:00:45,480
political crisis to achieve its end.
Now,

11
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:46,403
of course,
choosing a starting point for this is a 

12
00:00:47,901 --> 00:00:48,734
bit arbitrary.
There have been so called euroskeptic 

13
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:51,613
since 1973 when the UK first joined,
what was then called the European 

14
00:00:54,891 --> 00:00:57,260
community,
but if I had to pick a date,

15
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:00,920
I might pick September 20th,
1988.

16
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:05,360
When Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher 
gave a famous speech in Bruge,

17
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:06,283
laying out a number of the ideas that 
would influence euro skepticism for 

18
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,310
years to come.

19
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:15,310
We have not successfully rolled back the
frontiers of the state in Britain own to

20
00:01:15,611 --> 00:01:16,444
see them reimposed,
so tiotropium level with the European 

21
00:01:19,881 --> 00:01:23,390
superstate exercising or new dominance 
from Brussels.

22
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,280
The result of the speech with something 
called the Bruce Group,

23
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,293
a conservative think tank that promoted 
rolling back the [inaudible] trend 

24
00:01:29,851 --> 00:01:31,800
towards centralization.
Remember,

25
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:32,663
this was at the end of the Soviet Union 
and the world's great experiment with 

26
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:39,180
socialism.
Any form of one party centralization was

27
00:01:39,181 --> 00:01:42,690
a feared prospect by many.
One member of the Bruce Group,

28
00:01:42,691 --> 00:01:43,524
the historian Alan Scott,
took the idea a step further and 

29
00:01:46,261 --> 00:01:47,094
launched his own political party.
It was called the Anti federalists 

30
00:01:50,101 --> 00:01:53,910
league and it's one aim was to remove 
Britain from the EU.

31
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,700
We call Rhonda and affairs.
Nobody can.

32
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,070
This should be old,
too obvious,

33
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:01,680
but skids party had problems from the 
very start.

34
00:02:01,681 --> 00:02:02,514
In 1992,
the anti federalists league went up for 

35
00:02:04,201 --> 00:02:07,530
only one seat in parliament and only got
point two percent of the vote,

36
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:10,560
and it was the same in the European 
elections in 1995.

37
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,693
The young movement just lost faith in 
[inaudible] ability to lead them and 

38
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:18,030
there were internal arguments about 
whether the party which was soon renamed

39
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:22,380
Ukip or the United Kingdom Independence 
Party should remain a single issue,

40
00:02:22,381 --> 00:02:26,160
pressure group or expand into other 
issues and become a real party.

41
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:30,060
That in 1994 arrival,
euro skeptic party called the referendum

42
00:02:30,061 --> 00:02:31,830
party,
exploded onto the scene,

43
00:02:31,831 --> 00:02:33,960
led by a billionaire,
James Goldsmith,

44
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,450
who had no such problems with 
infighting.

45
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,470
All he wanted to do was have a 
referendum about leaving the EU,

46
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,333
and once they got it,
they would dispatch a politician's 

47
00:02:45,091 --> 00:02:50,091
betraying trust by holding a referendum 
which is binding on the government.

48
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,940
The referendum party trounced Ukip in 
1997,

49
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:54,893
but both were trounced by Tony Blair and
the rise of New Labor which would hold 

50
00:02:57,961 --> 00:02:58,794
the country for the next 13 years.
And yet for those who were looking 

51
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:04,120
closely,
it was possible to see Elaine opening up

52
00:03:04,121 --> 00:03:07,060
for doubt about the EU.
In 92.

53
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:10,930
Only nine percent thought Britain should
leave the EEC by 97.

54
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,793
That number had risen to 14 percent.
And if you added to those who thought 

55
00:03:14,711 --> 00:03:15,544
the EEC should at least reduce its 
powers and you have 66 percent of the 

56
00:03:18,761 --> 00:03:21,730
electorate expressing some form of euro 
skepticism,

57
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:25,360
there are a number of reasons why Europe
was brought into voters' minds,

58
00:03:25,361 --> 00:03:28,990
but the most significant has got to be 
the signing of the master treaty and the

59
00:03:28,991 --> 00:03:30,700
adoption of a single currency.

60
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,533
Something that in 1997,
only 16 percent of Britain's were in 

61
00:03:34,721 --> 00:03:38,260
favor of despite these trends,
you can look dead in the water,

62
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,990
but it was about to hit a few strokes of
good luck.

63
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,913
Well,
bad luck for James Goldsmith who passed 

64
00:03:43,751 --> 00:03:46,210
away only three months after the 97 
election.

65
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:47,223
Effectively disbanding Ukips only direct
competitor Alan scared was replaced by 

66
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:54,100
more aggressively populous figures like 
Nigel Farrage,

67
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:54,934
who was himself a seat in 1999.
And ironically the European Parliament 

68
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,260
by 2001,
despite not winning any parliament seats

69
00:04:02,261 --> 00:04:03,094
in Westminster,
Ukip had become the fourth party in the 

70
00:04:05,171 --> 00:04:06,004
UK.
After labor conservatives and the 

71
00:04:07,631 --> 00:04:10,090
Liberal Democrats,
their profile rose even more.

72
00:04:10,091 --> 00:04:10,924
When Robert Kilroy Silk,
a former MP and chat show personality 

73
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:14,963
join the

74
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,953
the main issue,
politicians in London decided to open 

75
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:25,020
our doors to a potential 70 million 
migrants from eastern Europe.

76
00:04:25,201 --> 00:04:26,580
That $73 million

77
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:30,260
kilroy silk was a controversial figure 
stemming mostly from an article he wrote

78
00:04:30,261 --> 00:04:32,720
called we owe Arabs.
Nothing.

79
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:34,063
Silk delivered you kips largest victory 
in 2004 is European parliamentary 

80
00:04:37,701 --> 00:04:40,850
elections coming in third above the 
Liberal Democrats,

81
00:04:40,851 --> 00:04:44,810
but more infighting eventually ousted 
him from the party within that year.

82
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,093
Yet his example shows the willingness of
UK to engage in the worst forms of 

83
00:04:50,121 --> 00:04:51,390
populism,
race,

84
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:52,940
baiting,
nationalism,

85
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,013
and fear.
Throughout the two thousands and into 

86
00:04:55,641 --> 00:04:56,474
the 20 tens,
you kept capitalized on a growing 

87
00:04:58,191 --> 00:04:59,024
sentiment among the British people of 
national decline in the post colonial 

88
00:05:02,331 --> 00:05:03,164
era.
Most keenly felt by the oldest citizens 

89
00:05:05,361 --> 00:05:07,730
who made up the core of the vote to 
brexit.

90
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:11,690
They capitalized to on crises like the 
financial meltdown in 2008,

91
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,450
the riots that swept the country in 
2011,

92
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:17,990
and now the migrant crisis and 
international terrorism,

93
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:19,283
Ukip and the far right assigned folk 
devils to many of these cases like 

94
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,710
immigrants,
Muslims,

95
00:05:24,711 --> 00:05:26,990
minorities,
and welfare recipients.

96
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,600
All of these things can bolster 
resentful,

97
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,463
nationalism,
but they have to be triggered by 

98
00:05:31,701 --> 00:05:33,620
something closer to home.
In this case,

99
00:05:33,621 --> 00:05:37,520
a lot of the research points to the idea
of class trajectory.

100
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:38,430
I have no

101
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:39,263
p as all up in my area.
I can't get onto the housing ladder and 

102
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:42,624
have three kids in one room.
A place where I grew up is now was a 

103
00:05:45,151 --> 00:05:46,950
lovely area,
but it's now a no go zone.

104
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,530
How are you,
Mike?

105
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,670
I can see my style of living in.
My family's done living,

106
00:05:50,671 --> 00:05:55,500
going down because of this influx that 
we can't control.

107
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:59,030
You can't say that you kept is the soul 
force behind Brexit,

108
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,953
but they've been there throughout the 
years to help link these real feelings 

109
00:06:03,711 --> 00:06:08,150
of falling trajectories to emotions 
about national decline and moral panics.

110
00:06:08,151 --> 00:06:08,984
That group,
the public and fear growing from 

111
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:13,730
minuscule routes into a significant 
player in the country's politics.

112
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,193
The United Kingdom is not a far right 
state with a nationalistic 

113
00:06:17,751 --> 00:06:18,584
anti-immigrant and racist people,
but their decision last week to leave 

114
00:06:21,351 --> 00:06:25,880
the EU one by a 52 percent,
majority of 72 percent of the population

115
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:30,920
can be viewed as an expression of a 
reactionary far right politics,

116
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,070
and that's the point about far right 
political organizations,

117
00:06:34,071 --> 00:06:34,904
they use the fulcrum of populism and 
fear to lift many times their weight in 

118
00:06:39,741 --> 00:06:40,574
people.
The ideas that animated this vote are 

119
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:46,790
there in Thatcher speech from 1988.
Of course,

120
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,830
the irony is that that's your herself 
campaign for Britain to join the EEC the

121
00:06:51,831 --> 00:06:52,664
first time around in 1975.
The even greater irony is that the 

122
00:06:55,881 --> 00:06:56,714
unchecked capitalism she championed as 
prime minister lead to a form of 

123
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:03,620
globalization that has ravaged the 
middle class,

124
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,633
the real cause of the frustration that 
you kept exploits to advocate of leaf 

125
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:09,643
foe,
but that's the difference that 40 years 

126
00:07:12,021 --> 00:07:13,580
can make.
Brexit,

127
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:14,623
recontextualizes,
all these small phenomenon threads a 

128
00:07:17,581 --> 00:07:22,581
string through them and shows that 
transformation doesn't always

129
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:23,743
have to.

130
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,660
Hey guys,
thanks for watching.

131
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:32,880
Sorry this is a day late.
Vidcon pushed me back,

132
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:35,520
but a hankering took responsibility for 
it on twitter,

133
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:37,350
so you can blame him for that.
