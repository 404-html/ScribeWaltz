1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,640
Okay,

2
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,280
copy on a Tuesday and blog 10.
We made it.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,781
Okay,
everybody.

4
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:15,614
Let's play.

5
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,390
What the fuck is going on in Europe 
tonight?

6
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:27,820
Okay,
so sovereign debt,

7
00:00:27,821 --> 00:00:28,654
also known as government debt is money 
or credit owed by a central government 

8
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,690
issue,
but it's also known as security.

9
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,030
Basically it's like me hitting you a 
piece of paper and saying,

10
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:37,893
I want to borrow $1,000,000
for you and I'll pay it back in two 

11
00:00:39,761 --> 00:00:41,590
years.
Let's take a look at you.

12
00:00:41,591 --> 00:00:42,700
Okay,
well dressed,

13
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,740
well spoken,
good looking.

14
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:46,290
Okay,
I'll do it.

15
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:49,140
I'll give you a million dollars,
but only if you pay me back a little bit

16
00:00:49,141 --> 00:00:51,180
extra in return,
but I thought we were friends.

17
00:00:51,181 --> 00:00:53,190
There are no friends in finance,
but okay.

18
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,113
How much do you want?
I want my million back plus three 

19
00:00:55,951 --> 00:00:56,920
percent.
A little bit about.

20
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:59,610
Okay,
where do I sign right here?

21
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,473
Governments do the same thing.
They issue sovereign bonds and accrue 

22
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,083
sovereign debt.
Such bonds are usually referred to as 

23
00:01:05,521 --> 00:01:07,680
risk free bonds because if the 
government can pay,

24
00:01:07,681 --> 00:01:09,690
all they have to do is raise taxes and 
print more money.

25
00:01:09,691 --> 00:01:10,524
Ice Cream,
because governments never ever default 

26
00:01:11,551 --> 00:01:12,384
on their debt.
It's practically unheard of that a 

27
00:01:13,051 --> 00:01:13,861
government could ever,
ever,

28
00:01:13,861 --> 00:01:14,790
ever get close to

29
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:18,200
you.
Hold on,

30
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,360
I'll get to you first.
Let's wind back the clocks.

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,350
On February seventh,
19,

32
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:25,184
92 presidents and prime ministers from 
12 different European countries 

33
00:01:27,591 --> 00:01:30,140
assembled mess to read Netherlands 
design the mess.

34
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:32,583
It was the document that led to the 
creation of the European Union and the 

35
00:01:35,181 --> 00:01:37,460
implementation of a single currency 
called the.

36
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:41,330
To join the EU countries needed to meet 
strict criteria like no budget.

37
00:01:41,331 --> 00:01:43,340
Deficits of more than three percent of 
GDP.

38
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:44,403
Debt ratios of more than 60 percent of 
GDP and interest rates on sovereign 

39
00:01:47,031 --> 00:01:49,600
bonds had to stay within two percent of 
the EU effort.

40
00:01:49,601 --> 00:01:52,580
Remember those numbers on January first 
1999,

41
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:54,590
the euro was introduced in nonphysical 
form.

42
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,453
Individual currencies like the German 
mark or the Greek drama were locked at 

43
00:01:58,131 --> 00:01:58,964
fixed rates against each other,
making that insignificant subdivisions 

44
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,410
of the Europe.
They had to get rid of three years later

45
00:02:03,411 --> 00:02:04,244
in 2002,
the notes and coins of the yard were 

46
00:02:05,661 --> 00:02:08,030
printed and distributed and countries 
started.

47
00:02:08,031 --> 00:02:10,340
The process of exchanging all their 
money for you,

48
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,750
why did they do it?
Why was the euro create?

49
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:13,131
Well,
you see,

50
00:02:13,131 --> 00:02:13,964
most of the trade in Europe is among its
own country by removing exchange rate 

51
00:02:16,671 --> 00:02:18,290
risks,
cutting the cost of transactions,

52
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:20,840
encouraging firms to trade across 
international borders.

53
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:24,420
The euro made the euro zone into an area
of monetary stability.

54
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,380
Data euro is the second most traded 
currency in the world

55
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:29,690
behind the dollar.

56
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,033
Through renewed cooperation,
Europe sought not only to ensure 

57
00:02:34,781 --> 00:02:35,614
economic stability,
but the international peace and peace 

58
00:02:37,841 --> 00:02:38,674
they got,

59
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:44,100
but ha ha,

60
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:51,310
I thought my jokes were bad in Greece 
where civilization itself was born,

61
00:02:51,311 --> 00:02:52,144
things had been going awry for quite 
some time after the switch to the euro 

62
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:57,100
that traditionally strong Greek public 
sector,

63
00:02:57,101 --> 00:02:57,934
so wages rise to outstanding.
Not to mention that the retirement age 

64
00:03:00,821 --> 00:03:03,550
in Greece was very low and its benefits.
Very generous.

65
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,090
These things aren't enough to sink a 
whole country.

66
00:03:06,091 --> 00:03:08,470
It was ultimately tax evasion,
which did

67
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:09,563
the coastal suburb of Kubota.
He is home to Athens elite an apartment 

68
00:03:12,971 --> 00:03:14,800
here.
It costs more than a million euros,

69
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,800
but despite the obvious signs of wealth 
efficiently,

70
00:03:17,801 --> 00:03:18,634
only 16,000
Greeks declared an income of more than 

71
00:03:21,461 --> 00:03:24,610
100,000
euros on their taxes last year

72
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,880
when people in businesses don't pay 
their taxes.

73
00:03:26,881 --> 00:03:29,190
It limits revenue.
What the country takes.

74
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,153
When the money ran out,
atkins turned to other European banks 

75
00:03:32,281 --> 00:03:33,114
for loans.
Soon they owed billions of euro and the 

76
00:03:34,261 --> 00:03:35,094
debt kept going up,
but how to grease acquire so much debt 

77
00:03:36,781 --> 00:03:38,400
when the guidelines of the European 
Union,

78
00:03:38,401 --> 00:03:40,170
we're supposed to keep decks reigned in.

79
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:44,420
I'm going to make this pencil 
disappeared.

80
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,960
It's hits

81
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,433
in 2010.
It was discovered that Greece had paid 

82
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:54,834
banks like Goldman Sachs,
hundreds of millions of euro and fees 

83
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:00,900
for arranging transactions that would 
hide the actual level of borrowing.

84
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:03,240
This allowed them to keep spending it 
accrue more debt.

85
00:04:03,241 --> 00:04:06,090
Upon the inauguration of George Peppard 
dre in 2009,

86
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:06,953
the Greek government revealed that it's 
finances were far worse than anyone 

87
00:04:10,051 --> 00:04:10,884
expects.
Their budget deficit was 12 point seven 

88
00:04:12,481 --> 00:04:13,314
percent,
four times more than the euro zone's 

89
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:15,504
limit.
The public debt was estimated at $329 

90
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:22,230
billion,
144 percent of GDP and April of 2010.

91
00:04:22,231 --> 00:04:23,064
Standard and Poor's decreased Greece's 
debt rating to the upper levels of junk 

92
00:04:26,671 --> 00:04:28,230
status.
Junk Status Bitch.

93
00:04:28,231 --> 00:04:30,330
Take a look at what happened to the 
interest rates.

94
00:04:30,331 --> 00:04:32,910
Have two year box.
Holy Shit.

95
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:35,400
Let's go back to that earlier 
conversation,

96
00:04:35,401 --> 00:04:36,234
but I thought we were friends.
There are no friends and finding well 

97
00:04:38,401 --> 00:04:40,610
with the EU.
That's not exactly the case.

98
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:41,483
By adopting the euro,
the countries involved basically agreed 

99
00:04:43,201 --> 00:04:44,034
that they would all be economic friend 
and when the drunken indulgent little 

100
00:04:46,561 --> 00:04:48,990
brother passes out in the gutter in the 
wrong part of town,

101
00:04:48,991 --> 00:04:49,824
they're responsible.
Older brother has to see that he gets 

102
00:04:51,751 --> 00:04:52,584
home safe in times of economic emergency
countries can usually just print more 

103
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:55,794
money and accept the inflation and 
devalued currency that comes along with 

104
00:04:58,561 --> 00:04:59,394
it,
but the countries in the EU gave up the 

105
00:05:00,691 --> 00:05:01,524
right to print their own money,
so now they have to depend on one and 

106
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:06,360
agrees is a relatively small country in 
the scheme of things.

107
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:09,360
A little economy compared to German,
but when Greece owes money,

108
00:05:09,361 --> 00:05:10,960
a campaign to Portugal and Portugal owes
money,

109
00:05:10,961 --> 00:05:13,080
you can't pay to Spain and Spain was 
when you can't pay to Germany,

110
00:05:13,081 --> 00:05:15,780
then a problem arise.
It's the domino effect.

111
00:05:15,781 --> 00:05:16,614
People fear it ripples through the EU 
that can hurt comparatively stable 

112
00:05:19,441 --> 00:05:22,740
countries like France and Germany and 
even the United States,

113
00:05:22,741 --> 00:05:24,960
so Greece needs help to save the euro.

114
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,793
The other countries have ultimately 
decided to bail out Greece on fifty 

115
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,750
cents of every dollar that it owes way 
to soothe.

116
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,320
It wasn't cheap.
You oughta know you bought it.

117
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,100
This in exchange for internal reform in 
the way of harsh austerity measures,

118
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,890
no more early retirement,
reduced pay for public workers.

119
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:43,650
Large scale cuts to social programs,
higher taxes,

120
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,160
and a staggered repayment of the reduced
debt.

121
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,540
A lot of people in Greece think the 
austerity measures are too harsh,

122
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:51,720
and so they've incited protests which 
continue to this day.

123
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:52,653
The problem with the European debt 
crisis is that Greece isn't the only 

124
00:05:55,741 --> 00:05:57,980
country in trouble.
How much Ireland owed

125
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,840
$865.
Billion?

126
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:02,300
Correct.
How much does Spain and Italy owed?

127
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,310
$1,000,000,000,000
each.

128
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,270
Correct who to mainly France,
Britain and Germany.

129
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,280
Correct.
And how Germany,

130
00:06:10,281 --> 00:06:11,510
France,
and Britain going,

131
00:06:11,511 --> 00:06:14,360
Roger will and struggling a bit of a.
correct.

132
00:06:14,361 --> 00:06:15,194
Why?
Because they've been told these vast 

133
00:06:17,451 --> 00:06:18,284
amounts of money to other European 
economies that can't possibly pay them 

134
00:06:20,241 --> 00:06:21,170
back.
Correct.

135
00:06:21,171 --> 00:06:24,230
So what are they going to do?
They're going to have to bail them out.

136
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:25,483
Correct.
Where are they getting the money to do 

137
00:06:26,391 --> 00:06:28,590
that?
Roger is a good question.

138
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,120
The answer to that one.
How much does Portugal?

139
00:06:32,121 --> 00:06:32,960
Oh,
hang on a minute.

140
00:06:32,961 --> 00:06:35,960
What was the answer to that alien?
Just keep answering the questions,

141
00:06:35,961 --> 00:06:36,400
Roger.
So

142
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,090
what is the longterm solution?
Most of the bailout money is coming from

143
00:06:40,091 --> 00:06:42,420
the European financial stability 
facilities.

144
00:06:42,421 --> 00:06:46,840
Someone to make the efs as a permanent 
fixture in the EU for whenever a country

145
00:06:46,841 --> 00:06:47,674
is.
Some had suggested that the weak 

146
00:06:48,431 --> 00:06:52,030
countries lead the euro's to others,
that the eurozone should be dismantled,

147
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,260
complete,
whatever the solution,

148
00:06:53,261 --> 00:06:54,790
whatever money's going to be put on the 
table,

149
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:55,624
it's all going to be conditional on 
serious structural reform within the 

150
00:06:58,271 --> 00:06:59,104
euro.
You hate to see a few bad seeds ruined 

151
00:07:00,611 --> 00:07:01,444
the party for everything.

152
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:02,303
If we don't deal with this now,
soon little at Germany here won't be 

153
00:07:09,751 --> 00:07:14,220
able to get a nickel for his grandma 
from the cloud.

154
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:15,923
Let's not blow this out portion.
You think you could steal from us and 

155
00:07:21,451 --> 00:07:22,830
just walk away?
Yeah.

156
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,873
Thanks for joining us.
That's another edition of what the fuck 

157
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:27,630
is going on in Europe.
