1
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:07,970
So I just watched Casey,
nice guide to instagram.

2
00:00:07,971 --> 00:00:10,850
Video is right here if you guys want to 
check it out.

3
00:00:10,851 --> 00:00:12,050
And I,
I couldn't agree more.

4
00:00:12,051 --> 00:00:13,490
Instagram has become,
you know,

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:14,473
my favorite social media platform to,
for all the reasons you know that he 

6
00:00:17,631 --> 00:00:21,860
mentioned that it's pure,
simple unsullied by the information dump

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,210
of facebook.
He just said dumb,

8
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:28,340
but more than being just unsettled by 
the volume of facebook.

9
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:32,180
It's also free of the performances of 
facebook too.

10
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:35,900
I've talked about our social media 
personalities before in Vlog Twenty,

11
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:37,280
70.
Click it right here.

12
00:00:37,281 --> 00:00:38,840
If you want to check that out.
For instagram,

13
00:00:38,841 --> 00:00:42,680
I personally follow three simple rules,
three simple donuts and I,

14
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:43,603
I've told these to my friends so I might
as well tell them to you to rule number 

15
00:00:45,621 --> 00:00:48,680
one,
don't take pictures of yourself.

16
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,090
Rule number two,
don't take pictures of food.

17
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:56,060
What could possibly be interesting?

18
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,160
How about your beef?
Boring,

19
00:00:58,161 --> 00:00:58,994
young.
What could be interesting about your 

20
00:01:00,141 --> 00:01:01,620
pasta sauce?
A doubt,

21
00:01:01,621 --> 00:01:04,340
your pepper Jack Cheese fondue,
and rule number three,

22
00:01:04,341 --> 00:01:06,390
and I think this is,
this is the hardest one to follow.

23
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:10,820
Don't take pictures that show you 
clearly having fun.

24
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:11,743
Now I still use facebook to be sure,
but I've moved more toward instagram 

25
00:01:15,561 --> 00:01:18,980
because facebook sort of became this 
virtual,

26
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:23,360
keeping up with the Joneses where 
instead of getting more and more stuff,

27
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:25,850
it was trying to look more and more 
cool.

28
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:28,310
I think of the instagram camera as my.
I,

29
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:32,150
I use it to share what I see so that 
people,

30
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:34,700
my friends can experience what I'm 
experiencing.

31
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:37,980
Do I sometimes break those rules above?
I mean no.

32
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,320
Never,
never.

33
00:01:39,321 --> 00:01:41,660
Do I ever break those rules?
Of course I do,

34
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:46,160
but they're in my head nonetheless.
If you have your own instagram rules,

35
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:49,490
leave them in the comments below and 
don't be afraid of those people who like

36
00:01:49,491 --> 00:01:50,120
to say,

37
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:50,953
I don't like to live by any rules and 
you can tell me what to do because that 

38
00:01:54,261 --> 00:01:58,550
person always talks like this and they 
have to live with that.

39
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,340
He's a nice that you live in New York 
City,

40
00:02:02,341 --> 00:02:03,780
right?
Let's collaborate.
