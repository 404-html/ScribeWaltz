1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,300
Coffee on the Tuesday and black.

2
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:12,500
Yay.

3
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,380
So today I want to talk about the 
greatest writer that ever lived.

4
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:28,640
Now maybe you know,
or maybe you don't know,

5
00:00:28,641 --> 00:00:32,090
but Roland emerick's new movie,
anonymous tickets is this Friday.

6
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:37,430
We'll know William Shakespeare,
the most famous author of all time,

7
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,080
right,
heard of 37 plays,

8
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:40,973
154 sonnets.
Several epic poem and why we are here 

9
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:50,820
today.
But what if I told you Shakespeare never

10
00:00:50,821 --> 00:00:52,920
wrote a single word.

11
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:55,250
Movies meant to explore the theory that 
William Shakespeare,

12
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:56,103
the average man from Stratford,
did not actually write any poems or 

13
00:00:58,661 --> 00:00:59,031
playing.
Now,

14
00:00:59,031 --> 00:01:00,520
conspiracy theories like this aren't 
new,

15
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:01,423
but it may be important to note that not
a single person doubted shakespeare 

16
00:01:03,051 --> 00:01:05,720
until about 150 years after his death.
In 17,

17
00:01:05,721 --> 00:01:08,420
69,
Herbert Lawrence publishes a book called

18
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:09,463
the life and adventures of common sense 
suggests that the culprit might be in 

19
00:01:12,321 --> 00:01:15,260
fact Francis Bacon.
Shakespeare depicted as a degenerate and

20
00:01:15,261 --> 00:01:17,960
a thief steals from the character called
wisdom,

21
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,913
who is the father of common sense.
And wisdom is meant to be amongst my 

22
00:01:22,101 --> 00:01:22,934
father's baggage.
She presently has designed upon a 

23
00:01:25,371 --> 00:01:26,204
commonplace book in which was contained 
and infinite variety of modes and forms 

24
00:01:30,201 --> 00:01:33,260
to express all the different sentiments 
of the human mind,

25
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:34,123
but this allegation is forgotten in its 
time and isn't revived until Delia bake 

26
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,920
in know relationships with the proper 
treatment and her 582 page book,

27
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:42,550
the philosophy of the plays of 
Shakespeare unfold in it.

28
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:43,383
She suggests that Bacon was directing a 
group of intellectuals who actually 

29
00:01:47,121 --> 00:01:48,980
wrote all the place.
Oh,

30
00:01:48,981 --> 00:01:49,814
clever bacon.
The Bacon theory falls completely into 

31
00:01:51,531 --> 00:01:52,460
madness.
When in 18,

32
00:01:52,461 --> 00:01:53,294
88,
Ignatius Donnelly starts claiming that 

33
00:01:54,831 --> 00:01:57,770
he's found codes inside the texts.
That's not all.

34
00:01:57,771 --> 00:01:58,550
By the way,
Bacon,

35
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:59,383
according to Donald,
is also Christopher Marlowe and 

36
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:02,543
maintained to check out these two final 
lines from the epilogue of the tempest 

37
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,510
as you from crimes with pardon be 
lecture,

38
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:10,060
indulgence set me free.
According to the audience.

39
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:13,730
These lines are actually an Anagram for 
tempest of Francis Bacon.

40
00:02:13,731 --> 00:02:17,780
Lord Vellum,
do you narrow divulge me words?

41
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,673
It is a shame that the literary appears 
twice in the first lines in three times 

42
00:02:20,751 --> 00:02:24,020
the second lines,
but no problem say that they come here,

43
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,930
just pop it apostrophe here and Bob's 
your uncle.

44
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,793
Apostrophes are so helpful like that,
but the man who was more recently 

45
00:02:29,511 --> 00:02:31,670
replaced back in as the elite contender,
the protagonist,

46
00:02:31,671 --> 00:02:33,940
the Roland emerick's film anonymous 
Edward de Vere,

47
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:34,813
the 17th earl a box for this theory was 
advanced in two large books by Charlton 

48
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:38,480
alcorn and his wife.

49
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,313
This star of England and the mysterious 
William Shakespeare of the central 

50
00:02:41,481 --> 00:02:42,314
arguments,
what the man from strapper couldn't 

51
00:02:43,281 --> 00:02:46,250
possibly have had the brain or the 
experience to write all those plays.

52
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,230
Only the Lord could have written them to
do their,

53
00:02:48,231 --> 00:02:49,064
had the perfect social background,
living for years and Queen Elizabeth 

54
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,473
Court and three did not want his name to
be known because a writing plays was 

55
00:02:55,281 --> 00:02:58,940
considered a vulgar pursuit for royalty 
and be the place show so much slimy,

56
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,913
corrupt,
loyal behavior that it would have just 

57
00:03:00,701 --> 00:03:04,280
totally blown up his spot.
And let's not leave out the secret codes

58
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:05,590
single.
Look at this line from act one.

59
00:03:05,591 --> 00:03:07,830
Scene five of the time is that of joint.
Oh,

60
00:03:07,831 --> 00:03:08,800
curse.
It's right.

61
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:11,080
They never.
I was born to set it right.

62
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:13,650
What?
What?

63
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:14,910
Oh,
oh,

64
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,050
no,
no,

65
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,550
no,
no.

66
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:19,223
Come on

67
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:20,223
about the poem by Ben Johnson and titled
to the Memory of my beloved William 

68
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:25,210
Shakespeare and that Johnson called 
Shakespeare the swan of Avon.

69
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,380
Oops.
Sticking to bear.

70
00:03:26,381 --> 00:03:29,410
Have property on the Avon River.
Nevermind that Shakespeare was born in,

71
00:03:29,411 --> 00:03:30,244
died in Stratford on bond.
This Johnson poem was actually the 

72
00:03:32,321 --> 00:03:33,154
preface to the first folio,
which is the first time that all of 

73
00:03:35,201 --> 00:03:38,410
Shakespeare's plays were collected in 
one place in 16,

74
00:03:38,411 --> 00:03:39,244
23.
The folio was prepared by John 

75
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,540
Hemorrhages and Henrico doctors who had 
worked with Shakespeare for 20 years and

76
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:45,740
gave him repeated credit of authorship 
and nevermind.

77
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,590
Also the Edward de Vere died in 16.
Oh,

78
00:03:47,591 --> 00:03:49,660
four.
And a play like the tempest for example,

79
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,370
is clearly dated 2:16,
11.

80
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,440
You know the [inaudible] have an answer 
for that.

81
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:56,350
They have an answer for everything,
but each arm reaches further and further

82
00:03:56,351 --> 00:03:59,110
out of its socket to find connections 
that just don't exist.

83
00:03:59,111 --> 00:04:00,970
And round and round we go.

84
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,833
Even Herman Melville and his final book,
Billy Budd names the captain of the 

85
00:04:04,061 --> 00:04:05,740
ship,
Indomitable Edward,

86
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,080
there,
Melville later said on that subject,

87
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:08,943
the names of all fine authors are 
fictitious ones simply standing as they 

88
00:04:12,341 --> 00:04:16,480
do for the mystical,
ever alluding spirit of all beauty which

89
00:04:16,481 --> 00:04:17,314
ubiquitously possesses men of genius,
but I think we shouldn't let this make 

90
00:04:20,201 --> 00:04:23,230
us complacent when it comes to the 
smearing of Shakespeare's name.

91
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,093
The people who don't have as much 
craving for conspiracy as Roland 

92
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,360
Emmerich won't suddenly be turned by his
movie,

93
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,223
but the world is full of idiots.
It's full of people sitting on their 

94
00:04:30,581 --> 00:04:31,414
couches and watching TV and watching the
trailer flicker by and saying to the 

95
00:04:33,821 --> 00:04:34,840
other guy on the couch,
hey,

96
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:35,501
actually,
you know,

97
00:04:35,501 --> 00:04:37,210
that's true.
He never did write those plays.

98
00:04:37,211 --> 00:04:41,740
There's like evidence.
There needs to be some respect for human

99
00:04:41,741 --> 00:04:42,574
genius,
especially when that genius comes from 

100
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:47,560
simple beginnings because that is where 
most genius comes from.

101
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:51,370
It comes from Lincoln Shyer or the 
Bronx,

102
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:52,383
or it comes from Liverpool or Stratford.
It grows out of practice and it comes 

103
00:04:57,381 --> 00:04:59,660
from the stars and I don't mean from 
aliens.

104
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,553
Oh,
in,

105
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:01,523
I mean that a genius can be any person 
who looks at a night sky full of stars 

106
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:07,340
and never gets over it for the rest of 
his life.

107
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,800
He does not in the stars to hold our 
destiny,

108
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,120
but in ourselves.
