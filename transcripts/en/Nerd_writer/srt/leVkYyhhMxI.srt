00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,370
Another day,
another 10th blog,

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:05,840
coffee on a Tuesday and Vlog 50.

3
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:19,760
In vlog 48,
I talked about reality,

4
00:00:19,761 --> 00:00:23,120
how growing up it seemed to me that much
of our social arrangements,

5
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:26,870
our convention,
less rules than communal guidelines only

6
00:00:26,871 --> 00:00:27,704
as strong as the community makes them 
and since the community is nothing but 

7
00:00:30,711 --> 00:00:31,544
people its rules,
its reality is as malleable as fluid as 

8
00:00:35,811 --> 00:00:36,644
we are in Vlog 49 without saying so 
challenge that premise somewhat by 

9
00:00:39,891 --> 00:00:42,950
asking whether or not you should give 
money to panhandlers.

10
00:00:42,951 --> 00:00:43,784
Now,
it would be silly to think that by 

11
00:00:44,751 --> 00:00:45,584
asking such a question,
I was trying to get at the incidental 

12
00:00:47,601 --> 00:00:50,690
convention of my given community at my 
given time,

13
00:00:50,691 --> 00:00:53,660
even if that type of answer is the most 
forthcoming,

14
00:00:53,661 --> 00:00:54,494
I was trying to uncover a deeper rule,
a rule applicable to all circumstances 

15
00:00:58,490 --> 00:00:59,323
and all times I was trying to suss out 
the older and wiser sister of 

16
00:01:02,421 --> 00:01:05,000
convention.
It's partner in the social universe.

17
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,193
The moral role.
Today I'd like to complete this trilogy 

18
00:01:08,211 --> 00:01:13,010
of videos and complete this line of 
thinking about morality as best I can.

19
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:13,883
Morality is about art.
It's about what we ought to do when 

20
00:01:17,121 --> 00:01:17,954
formulating a moral rule.
We're not saying what we should do in 

21
00:01:20,091 --> 00:01:24,020
order for this or that to happen.
We have to be confident that what we say

22
00:01:24,021 --> 00:01:27,350
is applicable to all people.
As a general rule.

23
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:28,213
For example,
let's say your friend tells you that 

24
00:01:29,181 --> 00:01:31,310
they just got a new haircut.
They love it,

25
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:33,740
but they want to know what you think.
Well,

26
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:34,603
you may think it looks bad,
but you say that it doesn't because you 

27
00:01:37,671 --> 00:01:40,310
don't want to hurt their field.
Now the moral rule isn't.

28
00:01:40,311 --> 00:01:43,760
Don't tell jerry his bulk cut looks like
shit because he's got a thin skin.

29
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:47,060
Clearly that applies only to Jerry.
The moral role might be worded.

30
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:49,780
Don't make people feel sad.
If you can help them,

31
00:01:49,781 --> 00:01:52,250
maybe you think it's right to tell Jerry
that his haircut,

32
00:01:52,251 --> 00:01:54,800
his unflattering,
you value the truth.

33
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,560
Even if it hurts another legitimate 
moral rule.

34
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:01,250
Always be honest.
You can see that morality is about right

35
00:02:01,251 --> 00:02:03,770
with a capital r and wrong with a 
capital w,

36
00:02:03,771 --> 00:02:08,030
and of course people can disagree on 
that like Jerry's two types of friends,

37
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:08,893
but that's a pretty innocuous example.
Here's another from Jonathan hates the 

38
00:02:11,841 --> 00:02:12,674
righteous mind.
Decide whether the people in this story 

39
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:15,943
have done something morally wrong,
so a family has a dog named spot that 

40
00:02:19,281 --> 00:02:21,290
they love.
They've lived with them for many years.

41
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:24,970
One day spot is tragically killed by a 
car in front of the families.

42
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,940
The family having heard that dog meat is
delicious.

43
00:02:28,941 --> 00:02:31,220
Cut Up spots,
body cook it and eat him for dinner.

44
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:32,810
Nobody sees them do this.

45
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,200
So what do you think as hate explains 
what you're probably feeling is disgust.

46
00:02:38,511 --> 00:02:41,300
You want to say that this family has 
done something wrong,

47
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:45,770
but then you remember it's their dog who
was already dead,

48
00:02:45,771 --> 00:02:47,990
so they didn't hurt it and nobody saw 
them,

49
00:02:47,991 --> 00:02:48,824
so nobody was offended.
Maybe in the end you decide that what 

50
00:02:51,081 --> 00:02:51,914
the family did was disgusting.
Something that you would never dream of 

51
00:02:54,711 --> 00:02:56,540
doing,
but morally wrong.

52
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:57,374
Well,
you have to say no if that's your 

53
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,460
answer.
If that's the way you feel,

54
00:03:00,461 --> 00:03:01,294
you're most likely from the west and 
you're most likely eliminate your 

55
00:03:04,511 --> 00:03:05,344
morality boils down more or less to what
the utilitarian genius John Stuart Mill 

56
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,513
wrote in his essay on liberty,
what most western governments are based 

57
00:03:12,641 --> 00:03:13,474
on.
The only purpose for which power can be 

58
00:03:14,591 --> 00:03:15,424
rightly exercised over any member of a 
civilized community against his will is 

59
00:03:19,391 --> 00:03:21,040
to prevent harm to others.

60
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:21,903
In other words,
maybe they're not people you'd want to 

61
00:03:22,691 --> 00:03:24,760
be friends with,
but it's their dog.

62
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,620
They're eating it.
Nobody was hurt,

63
00:03:26,621 --> 00:03:28,300
so leave them alone.
Now,

64
00:03:28,301 --> 00:03:30,640
if on the other hand,
you hear the story and you still say,

65
00:03:30,641 --> 00:03:31,474
yes,
this is morally wrong than you are 

66
00:03:33,491 --> 00:03:36,970
working off another axis of morality,
and to understand it,

67
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:40,570
we have to look closer at what Haidt 
calls moral foundations theory,

68
00:03:40,571 --> 00:03:41,404
the six axes of morality mixed and 
matched in different peoples around the 

69
00:03:45,011 --> 00:03:45,700
world.
First,

70
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,533
we have care harm what we've essentially
already covered and what makes up most 

71
00:03:50,051 --> 00:03:50,884
of the Western liberal morality.
Making sure that nobody is hurt unless 

72
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:57,400
they're trying to hurt others and that 
everyone is properly cared for.

73
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,780
Second,
you have fairness.

74
00:03:58,781 --> 00:03:59,614
Cheating,
something that will also be familiar to 

75
00:04:01,091 --> 00:04:01,924
us,
we believe that people should read a 

76
00:04:02,711 --> 00:04:07,420
proportional share of what they saw and 
we despise those who try to get more for

77
00:04:07,421 --> 00:04:07,920
less work.

78
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,100
Third,
loyalty,

79
00:04:09,101 --> 00:04:12,040
betrayal,
what makes us feel pride for our groups,

80
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:15,160
whether they be sports teams or 
political parties or nations,

81
00:04:15,161 --> 00:04:15,994
and what makes us feel rage against 
those who are traders to fourth 

82
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,520
authority.
Subversion,

83
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:21,363
which highlights the feeling that we 
need leaders and that we fall into some 

84
00:04:23,951 --> 00:04:27,490
manmade or natural hierarchies like a 
family or a corporation.

85
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,473
Navigating this moral terrain means 
respecting your superiors while gaining 

86
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:32,374
the respect from those below you so that
you can move up and down the social 

87
00:04:34,931 --> 00:04:37,120
ladder without triggering.
Number five,

88
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,410
liberty,
oppression.

89
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,393
We have a sense of when vulnerable 
groups are being exploited or when our 

90
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:46,510
liberties are being infringed upon,
say by a tyrant.

91
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,673
This can be interpreted differently 
based on what your political leanings 

92
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,550
and finally,
number six,

93
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:54,610
sanctity degradation,
what may cause us to feel that yes,

94
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,593
eating your own dog is morally wrong.
There are higher and lower ways of 

95
00:04:59,741 --> 00:04:59,980
light.

96
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:00,813
This foundation holds like a spectrum 
stretching from lowly degenerates to 

97
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:06,100
pure soul.
The Western liberal morality,

98
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:06,993
as I said,
leans heavily on the care harm 

99
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:10,930
foundation with a little bit of 
fairness.

100
00:05:10,931 --> 00:05:13,060
Cheating and liberty oppression thrown 
in.

101
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:16,390
Liberals don't care so much about the 
other three.

102
00:05:16,391 --> 00:05:19,250
In fact,
they may rail against them as immoral,

103
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:22,000
but ours is not the only morality in the
world.

104
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,170
Many cultures,
in fact,

105
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,400
most cultures,
in fact,

106
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:28,300
some in our own country put a lot of 
their stock in sanctity degradation,

107
00:05:28,301 --> 00:05:30,460
for example,
especially religious culture.

108
00:05:30,461 --> 00:05:34,120
The Bible and other sacred texts are 
filled with rules on how you're supposed

109
00:05:34,121 --> 00:05:34,954
to act to align yourself with God.
For what reason should the Bible teach 

110
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:42,730
abstinence or the Torah forbid poor.
If not that chastity is considered godly

111
00:05:42,731 --> 00:05:45,520
and pork is considered unclean and 
impure.

112
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:46,383
These are just a couple of the modern 
manifestations of sanctity degradation 

113
00:05:49,031 --> 00:05:51,220
and like authority,
subversion and loyalty,

114
00:05:51,221 --> 00:05:51,820
betrayal.

115
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:56,110
They are felt more strongly in cultures 
where the community is the central unit,

116
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:59,600
not the individual.
This is why patriarchal societies exist,

117
00:05:59,601 --> 00:06:02,570
in which there are roles for women that 
would make feminist gas,

118
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:03,404
but in which those women don't speak out
because they see the family as more 

119
00:06:06,531 --> 00:06:07,364
important than themselves.
All of these are real moralities and 

120
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,480
each foundation is the product of 
millions of years of evolution.

121
00:06:14,481 --> 00:06:15,314
They were naturally selected to overcome
certain adaptive challenges like caring 

122
00:06:19,251 --> 00:06:23,600
for one's children or forming cohesive 
coalitions or avoiding contaminants.

123
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,463
Of course,
the modern triggers for these 

124
00:06:25,011 --> 00:06:27,770
foundations can be very different from 
the original ones.

125
00:06:27,771 --> 00:06:28,820
100,000
years ago,

126
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:31,730
staying pure meant staying clean to 
avoid infection,

127
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,820
passing on animal meat that was rotten 
or poisonous.

128
00:06:34,821 --> 00:06:38,150
Today it finds expression in virtue and 
vice as they say,

129
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:42,410
cleanliness is next to godliness.
The essential point is that morality,

130
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:47,500
a product of evolution functions on more
axes than simply the golden rule.

131
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,793
That's a descriptive fact about humans 
and understanding all six foundations 

132
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:56,480
will help you not to immediately brush 
off as stupid or evil.

133
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,433
Those who think differently than you.
It's not to say to be clear that all 

134
00:07:01,881 --> 00:07:05,390
moralities and all moral foundations are
equally good,

135
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,840
but deciding what combination is best 
for society is the work of another field

136
00:07:13,191 --> 00:07:15,740
called normative ethics.
It's work.

137
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:18,710
I'm afraid that I ought to leave up to 
you.

138
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,373
Hey everybody.
Thank you so much for sticking with me 

139
00:07:26,841 --> 00:07:30,470
for 50 blogs.
I can't believe we've done that many.

140
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:34,640
I think the nerd writer has transformed 
a lot since the beginning.

141
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:35,743
You know,
this is not a vlog about factoids or 

142
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:42,270
just learning stuff.
It's a flag about building worldview.

143
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,153
That's what the experiment of the nerd 
writer is and I don't mean for you to 

144
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:50,090
take my worldview and that's what these 
videos are.

145
00:07:50,091 --> 00:07:53,720
It's to see how you can build one for 
yourself.

146
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:57,260
If you want to watch parts one and two 
of the morality trilogy,

147
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:58,490
you can find them here.
Also,

148
00:07:58,491 --> 00:08:02,390
don't forget to follow me on tumbler and
twitter links in the description.

149
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,060
I hope you stay with me for another 50
