1
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:06,130
It was Stephen Fry,
I think,

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:11,020
who said a truth thing poorly expressed 
is alive.

3
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,133
It's the theory that the language you 
speak determines how you think it 

4
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:22,060
affects how you see everything.
The point being that there is no thought

5
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:25,480
without expression,
no content without form,

6
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:29,620
that an idea,
however profound it feels to you,

7
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:35,050
does not really exist until you can 
write it down or in some cases put it on

8
00:00:36,371 --> 00:00:37,204
film to watch Disney Villeneuve's 
arrival is to watch a film maker in 

9
00:00:40,751 --> 00:00:44,440
command of the language.
His ideas presuppose,

10
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:48,370
which is to say that he has a firm grasp
on craft.

11
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:49,293
I can't really tell you how soothing 
this is for me as a film goer to feel 

12
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:53,223
that I'm in the hands of someone who 
knows why the film is constructed the 

13
00:00:56,261 --> 00:00:57,094
way it is.
So much of today's filmmaking is all 

14
00:00:59,141 --> 00:00:59,974
over the place,
to the point where the viewer has to 

15
00:01:01,571 --> 00:01:06,190
exert themselves more to compensate for 
a lack of focus in this way.

16
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:09,670
I think arrival is the perfect response 
to the bad movies.

17
00:01:09,671 --> 00:01:12,640
We see so much of pretty much everything
they do,

18
00:01:12,641 --> 00:01:14,710
wrong arrival dose,
right?

19
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,633
It is effective and impactful and it 
does this by focusing on the very thing 

20
00:01:19,211 --> 00:01:24,211
that affects and impacts us language,
but I think arrival is just as concerned

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
with the language of film as it is with 
written or spoken or alien language.

22
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:31,143
For example,
the first couple of scenes are kind of 

23
00:01:32,561 --> 00:01:35,890
like an enlarged experiment in the 
coolest shop effect,

24
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:36,813
the phenomenon in which a viewer derives
meaning from two sequential shots that 

25
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:41,583
hitchcock famously illustrated by 
turning a kindly gentleman into a 

26
00:01:45,131 --> 00:01:47,860
pervert by replacing a single reverse 
shot.

27
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:49,840
They'll move,
does the same thing in a rival,

28
00:01:49,841 --> 00:01:50,674
but on the scene level.
The first scene is a montage of the 

29
00:01:53,471 --> 00:01:56,620
birth and young death of Amy Adams 
starter.

30
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:57,603
The second scene is Adam's coming to 
teach at her school on the day of the 

31
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:01,533
aliens arrival and because of the 
tragedy we witness in the first scene 

32
00:02:04,631 --> 00:02:07,000
and our assumption that the film's 
timeline is linear.

33
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,043
We read Adam's disinterest here as 
despondency and her general demeanor as 

34
00:02:13,031 --> 00:02:13,864
one of deep sadness and heartache.
It's not until we finished the film and 

35
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:18,304
learn that the opening montage happens 
after the events of the movie that we 

36
00:02:21,731 --> 00:02:26,731
understand Adams in the second scene was
merely a blank canvas that we attached,

37
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:28,630
meaning to

38
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:29,463
montage means the assembly of pieces of 
film which moved in rapid succession 

39
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,830
before the I create an idea

40
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:40,003
what separates Ville knew from many 
other filmmakers is his ability to 

41
00:02:42,891 --> 00:02:46,910
generate ideas with cinematic craft.
Then on another level,

42
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:47,773
mingle those ideas collide and blend 
them to create a higher order of 

43
00:02:51,381 --> 00:02:53,690
meaning.
What's the meaning,

44
00:02:53,691 --> 00:02:54,524
for example,
that bill knew suggests with this 

45
00:02:55,881 --> 00:03:00,881
coolest job effect experiment perhaps 
that the future can influence the past.

46
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:02,403
That's certainly a reasonable thing to 
derive from this kind of experience in 

47
00:03:05,381 --> 00:03:06,430
the film.
In fact,

48
00:03:06,431 --> 00:03:07,264
it's an idea that turns out to be the 
key to the climax of arrival as Adam's 

49
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:11,314
learns that the aliens are higher 
dimensional beings that can see all of 

50
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:15,723
time at once and uses that skill to 
access future events to influence her 

51
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,263
present,
but you could also read another meaning 

52
00:03:26,951 --> 00:03:27,784
from the same experience.
Namely that communication is limited by 

53
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,660
perspective.
From our perspective at the beginning of

54
00:03:34,661 --> 00:03:35,494
the film,
everything tells us that Adams is 

55
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:38,284
grieving.

56
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:40,780
Only later did we learn that that wasn't
true.

57
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:41,703
It's to is a major theme of a rifle.
The limits of human communication are 

58
00:03:45,911 --> 00:03:49,090
reinforced and expanded upon in probe 
throughout the film,

59
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:52,840
the limits of our biology of relying on 
what our census report,

60
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:57,580
the limits imposed on us by our culture 
or our own personalities.

61
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:58,443
Trust me,
you can understand communication and 

62
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:03,550
still ended up staying in conversation 
with the aliens.

63
00:04:03,551 --> 00:04:06,580
Communication is literally imagined as a
screen,

64
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:10,900
a mediator that blurs intention.
Now screens can connect us.

65
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:14,320
They can also divide us and it's the 
same with communication.

66
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:17,260
Communication is a link between two 
parties,

67
00:04:17,261 --> 00:04:20,050
but it's a link that often facilitates a
split

68
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,113
language is the foundation of 
civilization use glue that holds people 

69
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:27,720
together is the first weapon drawn into 
conflict.

70
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:30,240
We are falling asleep.
I don't up people.

71
00:04:30,241 --> 00:04:32,100
You know what I'm talking about.
I know you do.

72
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:35,190
What's important here is not that both 
these readings are valid,

73
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,173
they are,
but that both have echoes elsewhere in 

74
00:04:37,651 --> 00:04:40,380
the film and echo off each other a 
theme.

75
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:44,400
Once introduced isn't wasted,
the alien language is circular,

76
00:04:44,401 --> 00:04:45,234
so the film is to the difficulty of 
cooperation in the small group at the 

77
00:04:48,451 --> 00:04:49,284
Montana site,
echoes the difficulty of cooperation 

78
00:04:51,241 --> 00:04:52,074
between nations.
Louise's understanding of her 

79
00:04:53,971 --> 00:04:54,804
displacement in time happens 
simultaneously with the audiences 

80
00:04:57,631 --> 00:05:00,600
realization that the events depicted 
aren't linear,

81
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,463
non zero sum game.
Every theme is filtered through other 

82
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:05,004
moments and characters and eventually 
other themes until it starts to feel 

83
00:05:08,371 --> 00:05:09,204
like something solid.
You start to think what is the 

84
00:05:11,701 --> 00:05:16,701
relationship between language and time?
Maybe it's that the mind is not a thing,

85
00:05:17,311 --> 00:05:20,370
but a process language happening in 
time.

86
00:05:20,371 --> 00:05:24,210
Just like film is communication 
occurring in time.

87
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:26,760
You had noise in schools anymore.

88
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:36,040
A Muslim is video,

89
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:41,580
so much of arrival seems to be about the
possibility of meaning in film.

90
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,470
What is it?
Where does it come from?

91
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,700
I think Villeneuve imagines it as an 
alien spacecraft,

92
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,410
mysterious,
obscure,

93
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:50,693
and expression that's not quite written 
or spoken language and so always 

94
00:05:53,851 --> 00:05:54,684
difficult to decipher something when 
born out of craft and character and 

95
00:05:58,431 --> 00:06:03,431
story is always hovering over the film.
It's always in the background scene from

96
00:06:03,771 --> 00:06:06,260
different angles,
impossible to avoid.

97
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:11,510
Arrival isn't just a repudiation of bad 
movies because it leads by example.

98
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:12,860
It's also,
I think,

99
00:06:12,861 --> 00:06:16,850
an active exploration into what makes a 
movie great.

100
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:17,933
It explores the kind of unique 
perspective that a film can gift to the 

101
00:06:21,831 --> 00:06:26,831
film goer like a language gifted by 
aliens and what kind of brand new world.

102
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:31,430
That perspective allows us to see.

103
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,590
Hey everybody.
Thanks for watching.

104
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,800
Happy Wednesday and have you been on 
time?

105
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,400
Stay to my girlfriend who's sitting 
right over there,

106
00:06:46,401 --> 00:06:48,980
even though it's a day late.
I recorded this on Valentine's Day,

107
00:06:48,981 --> 00:06:50,750
so I love you baby.
Anyway,

108
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:54,470
thank you to squarespace for sponsoring
