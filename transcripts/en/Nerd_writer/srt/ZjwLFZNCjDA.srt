1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,650
All right,
welcome.

2
00:00:01,651 --> 00:00:02,484
Thank you so much for coming.
So it took a lot of work to get this 

3
00:00:06,121 --> 00:00:06,954
play off the ground.
I don't want to say too much because I 

4
00:00:08,791 --> 00:00:09,624
don't want to spoil anything,
but all I'll say is I hope you enjoy 

5
00:00:12,961 --> 00:00:15,360
this as much as we enjoyed making it

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,240
either basic purpose of art is to 
eliminate human nature.

7
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:23,423
Then I think comedy central's Nathan for
you deserves a spot in the conversation 

8
00:00:26,591 --> 00:00:28,900
about the best tv shows of this era.

9
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,870
A while ago I was working with a juggle 
child.

10
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:32,973
His name was a dandy.
He was a great inspiration for me and 

11
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:37,383
unfortunately,
tragically he died and when baboons 

12
00:00:39,971 --> 00:00:42,090
kidnapped and ate him,
not

13
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,960
only is it so funny that I cry laughing 
at almost every episode,

14
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,400
but it reveals small truths about human 
nature in a way that's unique.

15
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,340
I think for television in this episode,
for example,

16
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:54,203
Nathan on his never ending quest to help
small businesses meets a bar owner who 

17
00:00:58,531 --> 00:01:03,531
says her bottom line was cut in half by 
laws that prohibit smoking indoors.

18
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:04,913
So to fix this,
Nathan finds a legal loophole that says 

19
00:01:07,411 --> 00:01:11,880
people can smoke inside if the smoking 
is part of a theatrical production,

20
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:12,953
so we tell smokers to come back,
then invites a couple of theater goers 

21
00:01:16,081 --> 00:01:16,914
to sit in a special audience section 
where they think they're watching a 

22
00:01:20,671 --> 00:01:21,504
legitimate play.
It's so funny because it's like so 

23
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:27,660
nothing in a way but incredibly 
profound.

24
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,553
There are three categories of people 
involved in this scheme and the each 

25
00:01:31,471 --> 00:01:33,600
know different things.
Well,

26
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,760
four categories if you're counting 
Nathan,

27
00:01:35,761 --> 00:01:37,170
but we'll get to him later.

28
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:39,750
The first is ellen,
the bar owner.

29
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,860
She thinks Nathan is a business 
consultant with a reality TV show who is

30
00:01:43,861 --> 00:01:47,640
genuinely trying to help her by 
exploiting a loophole in the law.

31
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,593
Then there are the bars,
patrons who think they found a place to 

32
00:01:51,181 --> 00:01:54,030
smoke inside without reproach.
Unlike Ellen,

33
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:56,580
the patrons don't know about the 
theatrical framing,

34
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,473
presumably thinking that the audience 
section is just another seating area in 

35
00:02:00,901 --> 00:02:02,040
the bar.
Finally,

36
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:06,690
there are the theater goers who don't 
know about the business consultation and

37
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,480
genuinely think they're seeing an 
experimental production.

38
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,780
There are a lot of ways that you can 
read this show.

39
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,210
Full fat videos made an excellent piece 
recently on how Nathan,

40
00:02:15,211 --> 00:02:18,270
for you satirizes the phenomenon of fake
news.

41
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:20,160
I'll link to it below,
definitely check that out,

42
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,293
but one of the other key things I think 
Nathan is interested in here is showing 

43
00:02:23,941 --> 00:02:24,774
us how people really act when normal 
expectations are met with absurd 

44
00:02:29,161 --> 00:02:29,994
circumstances.
As John Teddy of the navy club once 

45
00:02:32,341 --> 00:02:33,174
said,
fielder uses the rank artificiality of 

46
00:02:35,581 --> 00:02:40,581
TV and TV making to extract this 
surprising authenticity out of people.

47
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,250
Everybody involved in this setup knows 
that they're being filmed.

48
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,263
They just don't know what they're being 
filmed for or rather what they think 

49
00:02:48,691 --> 00:02:49,524
they're being filmed for is wrong,
and the dramatic irony opened up by the 

50
00:02:52,981 --> 00:02:56,010
difference between what they think and 
what we know.

51
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:00,400
Let's a realness in their character 
slipped through our realness.

52
00:03:00,401 --> 00:03:01,930
They don't even know they're offering

53
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:02,893
the couple stands out to me because it 
tells a story that maybe they're in a 

54
00:03:07,431 --> 00:03:08,264
new relationship and I think that 
curiosity is what makes me want to 

55
00:03:12,411 --> 00:03:16,460
continue to watch.
Do you think this has theatrical merit?

56
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:22,170
You know,
this is slice of life theater and uh,

57
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,290
for that aspect,
I think it's important

58
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,233
for Nathan,
one level of artificiality is never 

59
00:03:27,551 --> 00:03:30,820
enough spurred on by the real praise of 
his fake play.

60
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:33,520
He transcribes the real actions of the 
patrons,

61
00:03:33,521 --> 00:03:34,354
turns it into a real script,
and hire is real actors to play all the 

62
00:03:37,601 --> 00:03:40,570
parts.
Then he invites a real audience to watch

63
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,960
a real play,
which is all based on fakeness.

64
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:45,161
This time,
however,

65
00:03:45,161 --> 00:03:45,994
all the people involved are aligned.
The actress think they're participating 

66
00:03:48,641 --> 00:03:49,474
in a play and they are.
The audience thinks they're watching a 

67
00:03:51,701 --> 00:03:54,910
play and they are an ellen.
Well,

68
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,620
who the hell knows what Elon thinks at 
this point?

69
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:01,890
The only two categories of people who 
really know better are Nathan and us.

70
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,543
The original pretense of the episode,
Helping Ellen with her business problem 

71
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,293
is gone.
To have the external omniscient 

72
00:04:09,341 --> 00:04:12,610
perspective,
you actually need to know about the show

73
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:14,830
Nathan for you and what it's all about.

74
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:15,933
In fact,
that's what this moment is effectively 

75
00:04:17,561 --> 00:04:18,394
doing.
It's demonstrating the premise of the 

76
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:23,530
show itself.
I hope you enjoy this play as much as we

77
00:04:23,531 --> 00:04:24,364
enjoyed making it.
One aspect of this episode and really a 

78
00:04:27,011 --> 00:04:31,000
theme of the whole series is Nathan's 
desperate attempts to connect with other

79
00:04:31,001 --> 00:04:31,834
people.
Most of the time we're encouraged to 

80
00:04:33,491 --> 00:04:38,491
believe that Nathan is making people 
uncomfortable for our benefit so that he

81
00:04:38,561 --> 00:04:40,260
can reveal them to us.
I mean,

82
00:04:40,261 --> 00:04:41,860
I wouldn't want to be a third wheel,
you know,

83
00:04:41,861 --> 00:04:43,030
that's what it would be.
So.

84
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:43,830
Oh,
okay.

85
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:44,663
Yeah,
but the show also encourages us to 

86
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,720
question that idea sometimes intensely

87
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:52,780
look into my eyes and say,

88
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:58,430
I love you.
I love you again.

89
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:05,060
I love you again.
I love you again.

90
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:16,250
I love you again.
I love you.

91
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:27,410
Okay.
I love you.

92
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,480
Got It.

93
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,680
Oh yeah.

94
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:39,530
What you begin to realize is that no 
one,

95
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,070
not even the TV audience,
can have a more omniscient perspective.

96
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,233
The nathans own.
There's only ever one man behind the 

97
00:05:47,001 --> 00:05:47,834
curtain though.
The show does make a pretty strong 

98
00:05:50,181 --> 00:05:51,014
argument that he too is unsure of 
whether there's anything at the core of 

99
00:05:54,951 --> 00:05:58,190
all these layers of artifice,
of weird having cameras

100
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,023
around.
Right?

101
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:05,980
We can turn them off with a good way.
I feel like that.

102
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:11,990
Does that defeat the purpose?
I don't know.

103
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,300
What's the purpose,

104
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:15,643
Nathan,
for you is hands down one of the 

105
00:06:16,761 --> 00:06:17,594
funniest shows and TV history.
I'm obviously a huge fan and I've seen 

106
00:06:21,171 --> 00:06:22,004
some major results physically,
but there's more to this show within 

107
00:06:25,671 --> 00:06:26,504
just comedy.
Nathan uses comedy and the construct of 

108
00:06:29,091 --> 00:06:34,091
television to let us see into people's 
souls these little interactions,

109
00:06:34,491 --> 00:06:37,220
these moments of awkwardness,
insincerity,

110
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,410
what people are willing to say for 
success,

111
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:43,160
what people are willing to go along with
to preserve the status quo.

112
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,530
These are the building blocks of 
culture.

113
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,500
In the later chapters,
it actually says you spend a lot of time

114
00:06:48,501 --> 00:06:52,160
volunteering with jungle children,
but I don't know what that is,

115
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:55,610
but you might want to bring it out 
because audiences love someone who gives

116
00:06:55,611 --> 00:06:57,400
back and is charitable.
Okay,

117
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,970
but I'll be able to.
I'll tell them,

118
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,013
you know what they want to hear.
It can be shocking to see people like 

119
00:07:02,181 --> 00:07:06,200
this and part of the reason we laugh is 
to express this shock,

120
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,870
this embarrassment that seeing someone 
so nakedly,

121
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:14,030
but I think this laughter is recognition
to in the end,

122
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,073
these people are really no different 
than us who knows how we would react if 

123
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,760
we found ourselves in one of Nathan 
schemes without knowing it

124
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:26,530
work with a child named Andy who was a 
very.

125
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,460
It was an inspiration and just like to 
help and and,

126
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,940
and work with people with kids and at 
that time,

127
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:39,540
tragically he was kidnapped and he was 
eating by baboons at that time.

128
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,690
Hey everybody,
