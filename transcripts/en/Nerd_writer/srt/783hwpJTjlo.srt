1
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,300
Thomas pynchon,
sprawling,

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:07,570
epic,
postmodern novel gravity's Rainbow.

3
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:08,823
There's a sequence in which the main 
character is interrogated by the US 

4
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:16,090
government under the influence of Sodium
Amatol,

5
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:21,300
commonly called truth serum.
The writing slips into several dreamlike

6
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:23,740
rips on language.
In one,

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,633
a telegram from Wisconsin launches the 
main character into an obsessive 

8
00:00:28,241 --> 00:00:33,130
meditation on the possible constructions
of a six word sequence.

9
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:34,563
You never did the Kenosha kid.
As more and more examples are presented 

10
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:40,143
each with different punctuations,
we become aware of a key postmodern 

11
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:48,220
truth that words can point toward 
reality,

12
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:49,503
but they can never get there.
They always mean different things in 

13
00:00:52,361 --> 00:00:56,380
different contexts,
but just how many different contexts are

14
00:00:56,381 --> 00:00:58,840
there will pinch in,
only gives us seven.

15
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:01,900
There are far too many punctuation marks
and emphases,

16
00:01:01,901 --> 00:01:02,734
far too many combinations for a single 
writer to catalog them all besides in 

17
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:10,270
the aesthetic universe of the novel.

18
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:14,290
Cataloging them all would be exhaustive 
and redundant.

19
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,920
Enter the Internet and a man named 
Darrius Kazimir.

20
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:20,023
Hi everybody.
He makes what he likes to call weird 

21
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:23,173
Internet stuff.
I make what I like to call weird 

22
00:01:25,131 --> 00:01:25,964
Internet stuff,
which I recently come to accept is 

23
00:01:27,981 --> 00:01:29,570
Internet art.
Last year,

24
00:01:29,571 --> 00:01:33,110
Darrius made a twitter Bot that did what
the writer,

25
00:01:33,111 --> 00:01:33,944
Thomas Pynchon can't ever do.
It automatically generates a different 

26
00:01:37,491 --> 00:01:38,324
construction of the.
You never did the Kenosha kids sequence 

27
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:43,040
every two hours,
and as of this video,

28
00:01:43,041 --> 00:01:43,874
the account has already tweeted 8,600
times and with the number of 

29
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:48,763
permutations possible could continue for
years without exhausting every one go 

30
00:01:53,271 --> 00:01:56,030
there sometime.
Try reading a few outloud.

31
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:00,250
The effect of pensions language 
experiment is compounded,

32
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,120
updated the truth that wants to 
communicate is received in a new way,

33
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,253
and the exhaustive list that would have 
been inappropriate in a book is made 

34
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,070
novel and strangely vital in this new 
form.

35
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:14,503
I think what this shows us is that the 
aesthetics of Internet art of art made 

36
00:02:18,921 --> 00:02:19,754
with and for and on,
the Internet won't conform to any that 

37
00:02:23,241 --> 00:02:24,074
we've known before and that's fitting 
because a lot of internet artists made 

38
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,513
unlike any art that came before it.
Because Amy's twitter bots aren't made 

39
00:02:32,091 --> 00:02:34,610
with paint brushes or musical 
instruments.

40
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,920
They're made with algorithms with code.
This is what the Kenosha kid twitter Bot

41
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:43,430
really looks like.
Is there any beauty in that,

42
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,910
but what about this box?
No,

43
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:50,950
it's just a set of instructions.
Here's what those instructions do.

44
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:01,780
This programming rules perform a simple 
task.

45
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,913
They access the Texas Department of 
criminal justice and pull from the 

46
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:07,054
public.
Last word statements of death row 

47
00:03:09,251 --> 00:03:10,084
inmates.
Any sentence that contains the word 

48
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,193
love.
This art piece isn't out to make an 

49
00:03:16,331 --> 00:03:18,850
overtly political statement on capital 
punishment,

50
00:03:18,851 --> 00:03:19,684
like all good art.
This project organizes elements in the 

51
00:03:22,301 --> 00:03:26,470
world around it to help an audience see 
and feel in a new way.

52
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,113
The difference is that the World Kazemi 
is commenting on it isn't the physical 

53
00:03:32,021 --> 00:03:34,390
world not really.
It's the digital world,

54
00:03:34,391 --> 00:03:35,224
the world of the Internet,
and indeed much of our digital internet 

55
00:03:37,991 --> 00:03:38,824
art is focused on itself on the visible 
and more importantly invisible aspects 

56
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:47,680
of a network that's all around us.
Computation is now everywhere.

57
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:51,640
It is lead of everything and we are 
living inside that computer as well.

58
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,820
That's James Bridle,
a critic and digital artists.

59
00:03:54,821 --> 00:03:57,880
Bridal did a project recently called 
Rainbow planes,

60
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:58,923
a project that started when he noticed 
some odd artifacts from google earth of 

61
00:04:03,161 --> 00:04:06,010
planes with rainbow after images.

62
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,650
It's a glitch.
Um,

63
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:11,020
but like all true glitches,
it's not just a mistake,

64
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,023
um,
it's kind of an opportunity to look 

65
00:04:13,151 --> 00:04:15,580
through into the underlying systems that
produce this image.

66
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:16,443
In this case,
it shows us that the satellites 

67
00:04:17,681 --> 00:04:20,920
composing these images aren't using 
cameras,

68
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,023
but rather are collecting data from a 
broad swath of the electromagnetic 

69
00:04:25,781 --> 00:04:28,600
spectrum and they record red,
green and blue separately when they,

70
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,613
when they make these data images.
And so occasionally you find within 

71
00:04:31,691 --> 00:04:35,170
satellite images these artifacts which 
are produced by fast moving objects,

72
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:40,500
bridals digital art wants to help us see
the way technology sees us,

73
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,033
how hugely powerful systems have moved 
slowly into our lives without much 

74
00:04:46,811 --> 00:04:50,110
protest.
These systems are not like us.

75
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,990
We see with eyes,
they see with data,

76
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,183
we think with mines,
they think with algorithms aren't like 

77
00:04:57,221 --> 00:05:01,240
this shows us that our increasing 
dependence on sophisticated technologies

78
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:06,540
comes at the cost of substituting our 
values and our motives for theirs.

79
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:09,523
So maybe the aesthetic value of Internet
art is measured by its ability to help 

80
00:05:12,951 --> 00:05:17,720
us see the internet,
just as a novel can help us see language

81
00:05:17,721 --> 00:05:18,554
or an image can help us see reality.
That's just an idea and I can't say how 

82
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:27,800
valid it is for you,
but I think we do have to try to develop

83
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:32,690
an aesthetic for this new digital art,
a way by which we can determine which of

84
00:05:32,691 --> 00:05:35,530
it is good,
which of it is crap in which we consider

85
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:36,383
truly essential because what we think is
great art speaks ultimately to what we 

86
00:05:41,421 --> 00:05:42,254
think is valuable in culture and 
articulating our values about the 

87
00:05:46,371 --> 00:05:47,204
internet,
the global network in the years before 

88
00:05:49,311 --> 00:05:54,311
it consumes everything might just be the
most important thing.

89
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,320
Our generation.
Good effort to.

90
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:03,050
Hey everybody,
thanks for watching.

91
00:06:03,051 --> 00:06:06,260
Getting this in just before sunset here,
welcome to 2016.

92
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,553
You want to help me out in 2016,
you can pledge a dollar or $3 per video 

93
00:06:11,331 --> 00:06:14,930
by clicking right below here and going 
to my patrion page.

94
00:06:14,931 --> 00:06:19,100
That money will go toward making 50 new 
videos for you guys this year.

95
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,353
Just an exciting prospect to make what I
hope is content unique to youtube and 

96
00:06:24,891 --> 00:06:25,740
the Internet.
Um,

97
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
so thank you guys again.
I will see you all next Wednesday.
