1
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:06,323
Sentence should swing the sword.
I forget what you are the rest of the 

2
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:10,884
world.
We're not just sticking with the 

3
00:00:11,241 --> 00:00:12,074
printing.
The mind needs books like a sword needs 

4
00:00:13,981 --> 00:00:16,250
a wet stone.
Love comes in at the eyes,

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,153
the occasional kindness.
We spend all sorts of trouble down the 

6
00:00:18,721 --> 00:00:19,554
road.
Don't think someone says before the 

7
00:00:20,371 --> 00:00:23,350
word,
but mainly council desires I've added.

8
00:00:23,351 --> 00:00:24,184
It's to align with the phone.
Purse is only one God and his name is 

9
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:29,993
Mayan.
Doesn't concern himself with the 

10
00:00:31,021 --> 00:00:33,630
opinions of a sheep.
When you play the game of thrones,

11
00:00:33,631 --> 00:00:36,740
you're when you're dying and only by 
admitting what we are,

12
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:37,583
can we get what we want?
It's always the innocence was going to 

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,833
die.
I'll be with a song in my hot water is 

14
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:44,063
honor compared to a woman to love.
Doug is coming for all of us like crap 

15
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:49,923
about it.
They say the goes through life with his 

16
00:00:52,621 --> 00:00:52,960
bathroom.

17
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,960
Lines are down.
You can often be blind to the innovators

18
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,170
of your side.
God's wanting us to have to take will be

19
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:03,023
dyed or anything with a cook is easy to 
full power resides when then believe it 

20
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:10,280
resides.
There's no appeal for being a good act.

21
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:13,020
Does not wash out the bad,
bad,

22
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:15,210
good amount is what are the say?
He is.

23
00:01:15,211 --> 00:01:17,370
I know more Spanish to be cruel than 
weak.

24
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:19,890
No one can survive in this world without
how.

25
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:20,813
The more people you love,
the way you treat your oath recklessly 

26
00:01:23,401 --> 00:01:25,770
and your people will do the same.
People shouldn't live anywhere.

27
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:28,080
You need to burn shit to keep warm 
jugglers.

28
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:32,490
Singers required.
Plos influence grows like a weed.

29
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:33,533
Sometimes.
Severity is the price we pay for 

30
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,173
greatness.
It's a rare enough seeing man who lives 

31
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:44,500
up to his reputation.
It doesn't matter what we want.

32
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:48,130
Once we get it,
we want something else.

33
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:50,360
You waste time trying to get people to 
love you.

34
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,930
You'll end up the most popular man in 
town.

35
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,580
We do not choose our destiny.
We must do our duty.

36
00:01:58,581 --> 00:01:59,414
No.
All men should keep their words king's 

37
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,900
most of all.
Ready?

38
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:04,910
Hi,
I'm the king.

39
00:02:04,911 --> 00:02:08,710
Has No true cake.
Does that count?

40
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:12,453
Trying to work out who deserves what and
before long they spend the rest of your 

41
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:19,240
days,
we ping for each and every person in the

42
00:02:19,241 --> 00:02:20,074
world.
There's nothing worse than a late 

43
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,890
blooming philosopher.

44
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,320
Thanks for watching.
Hope you enjoyed it.

45
00:02:27,321 --> 00:02:30,140
