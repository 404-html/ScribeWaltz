1
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:06,620
So the original star wars trilogy 
episodes four,

2
00:00:06,621 --> 00:00:07,454
five,
and six has a total run time of six 

3
00:00:09,951 --> 00:00:10,784
hours and 20 minutes.
Each movie is pretty much the same 

4
00:00:13,551 --> 00:00:15,230
length,
a little over two hours,

5
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:17,420
and they're also the same in another 
respect.

6
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,350
The amount of time that they feature the
series main villain.

7
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:24,560
Darth vader in terms of actual 
screentime vader,

8
00:00:24,561 --> 00:00:25,394
gets astonishingly little in a new hope.
He's in the film for only eight minutes 

9
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:30,493
in empire strikes back.
He's in it for 12 minutes and in return 

10
00:00:33,231 --> 00:00:34,064
of the Jedi,
he tops out at about 14 minutes on 

11
00:00:36,561 --> 00:00:37,394
screen,
but these altogether and darth vader 

12
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:43,520
maybe cinemas most iconic villain,
if not character in general,

13
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:47,990
flashed across movie screens for a total
of only 34 minutes.

14
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:48,883
In this video,
I want to take a look at vader's visual 

15
00:00:50,781 --> 00:00:51,614
footprint in the original trilogy to see
if we can't locate what gives him this 

16
00:00:55,341 --> 00:00:57,680
iconic status in such a short time.

17
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:58,813
In episode four,
Darth Vader is only in six percent of 

18
00:01:00,651 --> 00:01:01,484
the movie and his scenes are striking in
how the character fades into the 

19
00:01:05,241 --> 00:01:08,030
background both narratively and 
visually.

20
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:09,163
For the bulk of episode four or Vader is
portrayed as the subordinate of grandma 

21
00:01:12,831 --> 00:01:15,770
off Tarkin,
so a good portion of his screen time has

22
00:01:15,771 --> 00:01:18,260
him in the background or off to the 
side,

23
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:19,243
cut off,
sometimes out of focus even when he's 

24
00:01:21,741 --> 00:01:22,574
being filmed directly.
Vader's black uniform feeds into the 

25
00:01:25,191 --> 00:01:26,024
shadows of the set and there is a 
noticeable lack of separation between 

26
00:01:29,001 --> 00:01:32,150
foreground and background.
Now it's hard to say how much of this is

27
00:01:32,151 --> 00:01:32,984
a narrative or thematic choice and how 
much is down to the constraints of 

28
00:01:35,931 --> 00:01:36,764
filming all of Darth vader scenes in 
episode four with the exception of the 

29
00:01:39,741 --> 00:01:44,540
first take place in or around the 
deathstar Gilbert Taylor,

30
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:45,374
the cinematographer,
was famously annoyed with filming these 

31
00:01:47,871 --> 00:01:52,640
scenes because he didn't like the black 
and gray sets made by John Barry,

32
00:01:52,641 --> 00:01:55,820
which provided little opportunity for 
targeted lighting.

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,833
Taylor was actually forced to cut holes 
in the sets and outfit them with courts 

34
00:02:00,201 --> 00:02:01,034
lamps that lit the environment evenly 
for flexibility in shooting flexibility 

35
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,133
but not specificity.
This is not to say that darth vader 

36
00:02:08,691 --> 00:02:11,140
doesn't make an impact in episode four.
I mean,

37
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:13,580
this is the film that launched the whole
thing,

38
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:18,440
and visually the movie does make a bold 
statement out of the gate by introducing

39
00:02:18,441 --> 00:02:19,274
vader right away as a menacing jet black
presidents against the white interior 

40
00:02:24,051 --> 00:02:24,884
walls of a rebel spaceship,
but I do think that there's more iconic 

41
00:02:28,551 --> 00:02:31,550
vader imagery to come.
You see that right away.

42
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:32,384
In episode five,
the Empire strikes back the first time 

43
00:02:34,551 --> 00:02:35,384
vader appears on screen.
You get this iconic helmet shot from 

44
00:02:38,331 --> 00:02:39,164
behind.
What's so cool about this shot is that 

45
00:02:40,821 --> 00:02:41,654
it's essentially black on black and yet 
director Irvin Kershner and 

46
00:02:44,781 --> 00:02:45,614
cinematographer Peter [inaudible],
find a way to make vader stand out with 

47
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:53,180
reflections and texture and shape all 
throughout the film.

48
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,043
They find ways to key into the elemental
quality of Vader as an archetype or 

49
00:02:58,341 --> 00:02:59,174
representation of evil,
and they upped the ante on the work 

50
00:03:01,631 --> 00:03:03,730
done.
And episode four in that movie,

51
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:05,350
vader's helmet,
for example,

52
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:06,184
is dirty smudged used.
This might have something to do with 

53
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:13,090
Lucas's desire to have a naturalistic 
documentary feel to the movie.

54
00:03:13,091 --> 00:03:15,550
Something he often argued about with Gil
Taylor,

55
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:16,743
but an empire.
The helmet is as smooth as volcanic 

56
00:03:19,481 --> 00:03:20,314
glass and always spotlessly clean so 
that it features these fat white 

57
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,890
reflections which highlighted shape 
Kirschner,

58
00:03:26,891 --> 00:03:27,724
and so she seemed to understand that 
visually vader increased in dramatic 

59
00:03:31,601 --> 00:03:34,810
weight.
The less naturalistic and more pure that

60
00:03:34,811 --> 00:03:35,644
he seemed after all,
the most iconic symbols in our culture 

61
00:03:37,711 --> 00:03:38,544
are the ones that can be boiled down to 
their basic shape and still be 

62
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:42,363
instantaneously recognizable.
Episode five takes advantage of this 

63
00:03:45,401 --> 00:03:46,234
with the masterful use of silhouette.
It's in these moments that vader 

64
00:03:49,421 --> 00:03:54,421
transcends his role as a character in a 
movie and becomes a symbol for something

65
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,400
much deeper and much more universal.

66
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,333
The empire strikes back,
I think is inventive with it's darth 

67
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:02,944
vader imagery in a way that both of the 
other films aren't as much with only 12 

68
00:04:06,941 --> 00:04:07,774
minutes of screen time.
The filmmakers do a lot to add to the 

69
00:04:09,911 --> 00:04:14,110
mystique of the character and the film 
features those images of vader that have

70
00:04:14,111 --> 00:04:14,944
seared themselves onto my mind.
From the very first time I watched 

71
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:19,043
episode six,
return of the Jedi largely holds onto 

72
00:04:21,401 --> 00:04:22,234
that pristine look from empire.
It even copy some of the empire shots 

73
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:29,020
exactly,
but overall Jeddah is less inspired when

74
00:04:29,021 --> 00:04:29,854
it comes to Darth vader cinematography.
He often looks flat against backgrounds 

75
00:04:33,071 --> 00:04:33,904
and the framing and lighting isn't 
nearly as compelling as Kirsch nurse 

76
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:37,624
work on episode five,
Kershner was so devoted to his own 

77
00:04:40,451 --> 00:04:43,060
vision that he didn't shoot master 
shots,

78
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,103
which meant that Lucas would have to 
edit the scenes roughly how Kirschner 

79
00:04:47,351 --> 00:04:48,184
intended them.

80
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:49,323
By most accounts,
Lucas' hired Richard Markwan as a sort 

81
00:04:51,461 --> 00:04:53,710
of working man's director for episode 
six,

82
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:54,723
somebody who could bring the film in on 
time and within budget and give Lucas 

83
00:04:58,421 --> 00:05:01,510
enough options to construct the film in 
the edit.

84
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:02,403
As a result,
episode six lacks the character work 

85
00:05:04,151 --> 00:05:06,130
that was a signature of [inaudible] 
style,

86
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,063
or what jetblue does give us is that 
famous final scene where Darth vader is 

87
00:05:10,211 --> 00:05:11,044
finally unmasked.
It's a moment that brings the archetype 

88
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,230
down to earth.
The actual face of evil is just the face

89
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:20,200
of a broken man,
more pathetic than anything,

90
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:23,470
and then that way deeply human.
Of course,

91
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:26,350
the legacy of Darth vader is an all in 
the visuals,

92
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:27,970
the writing,
the costume,

93
00:05:27,971 --> 00:05:31,570
and James Earl Jones vocal performance 
contribute hugely to the characters,

94
00:05:31,571 --> 00:05:34,690
continued faint,
even his breathing is iconic,

95
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,063
but film is a visual medium and when all
these things are wrapped in the right 

96
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,880
image,
the effects can be mythic.

97
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,313
What's amazing is that Lucas Kirschner 
achieved this in just a handful of 

98
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:51,690
minutes and the impact for itself.

99
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:03,840
