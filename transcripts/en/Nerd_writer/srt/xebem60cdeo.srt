1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,620
The beard is gone,
the hair was gone.

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,260
The coffee on the Tuesday is right here.
Why not?

3
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:16,860
So maybe you heard this story in the 
news.

4
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,570
The UN Population Fund says the world is
about to add.

5
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,553
It's 7000000000th person.
The UN says the world's population will 

6
00:00:25,981 --> 00:00:27,660
reach a milestone.
This Monday,

7
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,120
7 billion.
Pete,

8
00:00:29,121 --> 00:00:32,280
the world's population will hit 7 
billion,

9
00:00:32,281 --> 00:00:34,650
7 billion,
7 billion come Halloween.

10
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:38,250
There will be so many of us on earth 
that it's actually kind of scary.

11
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,050
It appears that the good old human races
now 7 billion strong,

12
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:41,953
that's nine zero,
133 times around the world counted in 

13
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:47,210
step 200 years to count aloud.
Starting from one,

14
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:48,740
two,
three,

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,460
four.
I did it.

16
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,473
So most of what I write is science 
fiction and the reason I love sciflies 

17
00:00:56,151 --> 00:00:56,984
because I believe that talking about our
future is the best way today to talk 

18
00:00:58,761 --> 00:00:59,930
about our president.
Whereas in the past,

19
00:00:59,931 --> 00:01:01,730
the best way to talk about our person 
was talking about our past.

20
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,313
Put it this way.
If the rate of technological evolution 

21
00:01:04,491 --> 00:01:08,360
being so fast,
our actions today directly implicate the

22
00:01:08,361 --> 00:01:10,280
situation tomorrow.
The president.

23
00:01:10,281 --> 00:01:13,010
So close to our future that it's like 
the shingles on the roof of the house.

24
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:13,880
Years,
days.

25
00:01:13,881 --> 00:01:14,714
Moments almost overlap.
Each science fiction can explore this 

26
00:01:17,571 --> 00:01:20,960
intimate relationship anywhere from the 
gutter to the very top all the time.

27
00:01:20,961 --> 00:01:23,300
Warning that if the structure isn't 
sound,

28
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,620
the roof will collapse.

29
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,620
When I tell people my right side fire,
I get the same question again and again.

30
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:29,450
What happens when there are too many 
people?

31
00:01:29,451 --> 00:01:32,180
What happens when the world becomes 
overpopulated?

32
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,033
Well,
it's a good question and one I tried to 

33
00:01:33,981 --> 00:01:37,900
address in my first long fiction novella
called big city.

34
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:41,000
I put the link to that whole book online
for your pleasure.

35
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:41,834
You can find it in the doodly do,
but let's return to the idea of 

36
00:01:44,151 --> 00:01:44,984
population growth.
If you want to know anything about this 

37
00:01:46,371 --> 00:01:47,204
subject,
you have to start with Thomas Malthus 

38
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:50,503
and his book.
An essay on the principle of population 

39
00:01:52,241 --> 00:01:53,074
was mount.
This is idea that humans are the only 

40
00:01:54,591 --> 00:01:55,424
animal on earth that increases its 
population beyond its available 

41
00:01:58,101 --> 00:01:59,150
resources.
Basically,

42
00:01:59,151 --> 00:01:59,984
we grow faster than we create food.
That leaves us with a whole hell of a 

43
00:02:02,271 --> 00:02:04,700
lot of people who are underfed and 
malnourished.

44
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:07,340
According to Malthus,
humanity grows exponentially.

45
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:08,203
Nothing,
not even the plague or two world wars 

46
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:11,840
can put so much as a blip in that graph 
in the year 1800,

47
00:02:11,841 --> 00:02:15,220
we were 1,000,000,200
years later and we're 7 billion.

48
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:16,083
Obviously we can't keep growing forever,
so eventually we're going to hit an 

49
00:02:17,931 --> 00:02:18,764
asymptote and level out what scientists 
have a very hard time agreeing on what 

50
00:02:21,501 --> 00:02:22,610
that number will be.
Yes,

51
00:02:22,611 --> 00:02:25,050
it's range from 10 billion to 20 billion
years.

52
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:27,860
What we do now during the agricultural 
and industrial revolutions,

53
00:02:27,861 --> 00:02:28,694
the life expectancy of children 
increased dramatically between 1730 and 

54
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:32,443
18.
Ten percentage of children who died 

55
00:02:33,801 --> 00:02:38,801
before the age of five decreased from 74
point five to 31 point eight.

56
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:39,763
Advances in medicine like compulsory 
vaccination had increased the life 

57
00:02:41,811 --> 00:02:45,820
expectancy from 38 and 18,
50 to 78 in 2011.

58
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:50,150
The population growth rate hated speed 
during the 19 sixties baby boom and just

59
00:02:50,151 --> 00:02:50,984
over two percent ridiculously high.
Some people started to freak out like 

60
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:55,460
Paul Albert,
you predicted in his 19,

61
00:02:55,461 --> 00:03:00,460
68 book the population bomb that we were
headed for severe worldwide.

62
00:03:00,461 --> 00:03:01,810
Fortunately,
early was wrong.

63
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:04,470
Innovation stepped in and saved the day,
and in this case innovation,

64
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,400
his name was Norman Burlap,

65
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:07,283
more than half the farmers of the world 
living the subsistence agriculture 

66
00:03:11,851 --> 00:03:14,430
outside of the economies of their own 
country.

67
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:20,510
They have had very little or no money 
with which to make purchases of the many

68
00:03:21,811 --> 00:03:23,700
items that you need for a decent life,

69
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:27,430
for is the father of the green 
revolution initiatives to develop higher

70
00:03:27,431 --> 00:03:30,690
yield crops using synthetic fertilizers 
and hybrid ice.

71
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:34,210
The Nobel Committee estimated that in 
1970 by the time he received the prize,

72
00:03:34,211 --> 00:03:35,044
he had saved a billion lives.
Don't you just feel like shit in his 

73
00:03:37,421 --> 00:03:38,254
acceptance speech,
he said there can be no permanent 

74
00:03:39,821 --> 00:03:40,654
progress in the battle against hunger 
until the agencies that fight for 

75
00:03:43,481 --> 00:03:48,430
increased food production and those that
flight for population control unite in a

76
00:03:48,431 --> 00:03:49,264
common efforts.
Through that the growth rate has been 

77
00:03:50,321 --> 00:03:51,154
falling ever since the baby boom and 
chances already won't reach that rate 

78
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,450
ever again.
But consider this diagram,

79
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,313
well,
birth rates in the developed world 

80
00:03:57,071 --> 00:04:02,030
decrease and level out around one point 
seven children per woman in Subsaharan,

81
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:04,750
Africa.
The rate remains at five or more,

82
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:05,643
or take a look at the distribution of 
ages in the developed and undeveloped 

83
00:04:08,351 --> 00:04:09,184
world.
Look at how many children there are in 

84
00:04:11,531 --> 00:04:12,364
the letter.
Subsaharan Africa is also where we see 

85
00:04:13,931 --> 00:04:14,764
the most poverty and malnourished.
Clearly there is a connection between 

86
00:04:16,991 --> 00:04:17,824
fertility rate and quality of lives.
It tells us that a large part of the 

87
00:04:20,141 --> 00:04:20,974
problem concerning population growth can
be addressed by the empowerment of 

88
00:04:23,741 --> 00:04:24,574
women.

89
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,330
Okay.

90
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,673
That's Joel Cohen,
mathematical biologist and author of 

91
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:44,943
educating all children a global agenda,
saying that not only is nutrition a 

92
00:04:48,161 --> 00:04:50,650
vital part of balancing population 
growth in hunger,

93
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,670
but also the use of contraception and 
most importantly education.

94
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,970
You can find the link to his Amazon page
in the dubliner.

95
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,873
I want to make one final point on 
population growth and I'll have malthus 

96
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,300
helped me out.
Again,

97
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,133
I believe that it is the intention of 
the creator that Earth should be 

98
00:05:04,181 --> 00:05:05,014
replenished,
but certainly with a healthy virtuous 

99
00:05:07,151 --> 00:05:07,984
and happy population,
not an unhealthy vicious and miserable 

100
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:11,434
one and if and endeavoring to obey the 
command to increase and multiply we 

101
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:15,214
people at only with beings of this 
latter description and suffer 

102
00:05:17,351 --> 00:05:18,184
accordingly.
We have no right to impeach the justice 

103
00:05:20,801 --> 00:05:21,634
of the command,
but only our rational emotive executing 

104
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,630
the justice of the committee.
Here.

105
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:29,110
He's talking about God's desire for us 
to multiply and grow.

106
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,970
Of course that's fully.
There is no god.

107
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:34,180
There is no question that as a species 
and like every other species on earth,

108
00:05:34,181 --> 00:05:37,450
we had the innate desire to procreate.
Part of it is evolutionary,

109
00:05:37,451 --> 00:05:40,210
but the question must be is all of the 
evolution.

110
00:05:40,211 --> 00:05:41,044
Do you want to have kids because you 
want to ensure the future survival of 

111
00:05:43,001 --> 00:05:45,040
the human race?
Or do you want them for other reasons?

112
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:45,874
Social reasons,
because it's strange not to or personal 

113
00:05:47,501 --> 00:05:48,334
reasons because you crave a specific 
kind of love because you want to be 

114
00:05:50,471 --> 00:05:51,304
needed.
Even secret reason secret to yourself 

115
00:05:52,571 --> 00:05:53,404
because you know that you will die and 
there's no escaping it in one way to 

116
00:05:56,201 --> 00:06:00,050
ease the pain of is to know that someone
will remember you and tell about you and

117
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:02,390
in that you achieve a kind of 
immortality.

118
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:05,900
Humanity can outgrow its evolutionary 
instructions.

119
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:07,010
By the time you die.

120
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,873
How many times do you think you'll have 
had sex to procreate and how many times 

121
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,163
just for pleasure?
Advances in medicine will allow us to 

122
00:06:13,611 --> 00:06:18,260
live longer just as we jumped from 38 to
78 and 150 years.

123
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:19,123
Advances in technology will not only 
allow our world to be energy 

124
00:06:21,021 --> 00:06:22,430
independent,
but ourselves.

125
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,980
Imagine getting all this sustenance you 
need from the sun.

126
00:06:24,981 --> 00:06:25,814
Imagine living to the age of 200 when 
you'll really be able to count to 7 

127
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:29,840
billion.
Maybe it seems out there too,

128
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:33,140
but evolution like population is 
exponential and when we can live as long

129
00:06:33,141 --> 00:06:33,974
as we want,
what will happen to our desire to 

130
00:06:34,911 --> 00:06:36,260
procreate,
to have children?

131
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,910
There is no easy way to answer this 
question,

132
00:06:37,911 --> 00:06:40,280
but I do my best to try in a second long
fiction,

133
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:43,700
a novel called all languages.
The rows coming soon.
