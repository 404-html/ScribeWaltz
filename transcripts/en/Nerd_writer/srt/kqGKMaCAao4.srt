1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:01,773
Mm.

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:03,903
Music videos are a weird art form.
They're often just a promotional add on 

3
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:10,030
to a medium that works just fine on its 
own.

4
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:11,013
In fact,
I think most of the time music works 

5
00:00:12,281 --> 00:00:16,420
better without visuals.
Videos seem to limit song somehow.

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,660
For me at least,
they closed down the possible ways I can

7
00:00:19,661 --> 00:00:22,150
experience the music most of the time.

8
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:27,310
Thirty minutes later,
the feds watching it on my gosh.

9
00:00:27,311 --> 00:00:29,310
Yes.
I mean you ain't getting attempts.

10
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:33,450
I'd be yelling stat in now.
Dual gram I do for content.

11
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,190
Lamar is new.
Video for his song element is a powerful

12
00:00:37,191 --> 00:00:41,270
example of a music video actually 
expanding my experience of a song rather

13
00:00:41,271 --> 00:00:42,104
than collapsing it and it's got me 
thinking again about what exactly makes 

14
00:00:45,561 --> 00:00:49,460
for compelling work in this,
in between medium watching this,

15
00:00:49,461 --> 00:00:52,310
I think the answer has something to do 
with collaboration.

16
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:53,323
Kendrick is known for a lot of things.
He occupies a really rarefied place in 

17
00:00:56,601 --> 00:00:57,434
popular culture,
celebrated for quality and integrity 

18
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:02,930
pretty much across the board with a 
couple of notable exceptions.

19
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,793
This is why I say that hip hop is that 
more damaged to young African Americans 

20
00:01:07,881 --> 00:01:08,714
than racism in recent years,
but we'll get back to that in a little 

21
00:01:12,471 --> 00:01:13,304
while.
One of the things that's less talked 

22
00:01:14,211 --> 00:01:17,720
about is Kendrick's ability to work 
seamlessly with other artists.

23
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:18,853
Of course,
collaboration is sort of a prerequisite 

24
00:01:20,841 --> 00:01:23,540
for hip hop.
Could rap music depends on the fusion of

25
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:24,710
lyrics and production.

26
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:25,723
Kendrick's role as a marquee artists and
hip hop is a lot like that of a film 

27
00:01:28,821 --> 00:01:29,654
director who acts in his own work.
He can control the lyrical content and 

28
00:01:32,481 --> 00:01:33,314
its delivery himself,
but it's also up to him to choose other 

29
00:01:35,631 --> 00:01:36,464
artists according to their strengths and
help them realize their own creativity 

30
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,173
in the service of his vision.
Working with him throughout the process 

31
00:01:43,431 --> 00:01:46,700
for me was like very.
It was like being needed,

32
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:48,380
like a,
like a piece of dough,

33
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,393
you know?
It felt like somebody was like bending 

34
00:01:50,271 --> 00:01:51,570
and stretching into like,
you know.

35
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:53,480
Yeah.
Pulling different things out.

36
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:54,403
It's this kind of skill for directorial 
collaboration that makes Kendrick's 

37
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:00,110
music videos so strong.
To understand the element video,

38
00:02:00,111 --> 00:02:03,560
you have to understand first the 
collaborators in this case,

39
00:02:03,561 --> 00:02:05,810
there are two,
one living and one dead.

40
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,033
The first is Jonas Lindstrom,
a commercial fashion photographer from 

41
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:13,550
Berlin lindstrom directed the video 
alongside the little homies,

42
00:02:13,551 --> 00:02:16,310
which is a pseudonym for Kendrick and 
Dave free.

43
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,173
The president of top Dawg entertainment 
element is highly reminiscent of 

44
00:02:19,911 --> 00:02:22,670
Lindstrom previous work,
namely his short film,

45
00:02:22,671 --> 00:02:23,504
truth or dare,
which features 21 performances or 

46
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:30,320
vignettes and elevated version of the 
content found on mobile phones.

47
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:33,290
Interested in the boundary between 
photography and film.

48
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:34,124
Lindstrom is great at creating these 
slow moving tableaus that serve as a 

49
00:02:37,671 --> 00:02:40,670
reference point for a larger environment
in element.

50
00:02:40,671 --> 00:02:41,504
Kendrick has them apply that to his own,
namely to the violence that's been an 

51
00:02:44,751 --> 00:02:47,390
inescapable fact of that environment for
his whole life.

52
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,330
Violence has always been a preoccupation
of Kendrick's work.

53
00:02:50,331 --> 00:02:51,164
He's examined it from every angle.
Looking at the violence that he's 

54
00:02:53,661 --> 00:02:56,240
endured sometimes at the hands of those 
closest to him.

55
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,270
At this data in front of my Mama,
my comes every medic

56
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:04,600
to come us bit jummah grandma's bed,
so when a buddy brand for me,

57
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:07,750
I'm on your head.
The violence he's caused,

58
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:08,683
the violence used to oppress his race 
and the violence is friends and family 

59
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,293
visit on themselves.
Each of these facets of violence is 

60
00:03:16,301 --> 00:03:20,110
distilled into a photographic moments.
Some of them connect,

61
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,393
but they're scrambled drawing you into 
this churning cycle of violence that is 

62
00:03:24,491 --> 00:03:25,324
the result of all these distinct images.
Kendrick can't be sure that he himself 

63
00:03:29,771 --> 00:03:34,000
hasn't contributed to this cycle.
He's deeply conflicted about his violent

64
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:38,080
past and about his position as wraps,
quote unquote savior.

65
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:42,070
Following the rapturous reception of his
last album to pimp a butterfly.

66
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:47,370
In many ways dam is a rebuke to that 
perceived divine status and element is a

67
00:03:47,411 --> 00:03:48,244
prime example of that rebuke.
Showing that he's not above hip hop's 

68
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:53,710
competitive shit talking.
They just that they wouldn't go see me,

69
00:03:53,711 --> 00:03:54,340
Huh?

70
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,260
Nigga stop decade.
That real life at the same light.

71
00:03:56,261 --> 00:03:57,094
The CLTV Huh?
They just want to flex Somia P and l a 

72
00:03:59,051 --> 00:03:59,910
for free.
Huh?

73
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:02,440
Next time that you get the 10 freeway,
we need receipt on.

74
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,423
The one thing Kendrick Lamar is sure 
about is that the music itself is not 

75
00:04:07,301 --> 00:04:08,134
the problem.
This is why I say that hip hop has done 

76
00:04:09,971 --> 00:04:14,650
more damage to young African Americans 
than racism in recent years.

77
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,900
Kendrick plays the sample elsewhere on 
the album.

78
00:04:16,901 --> 00:04:18,790
Clearly it's something he's wrestled 
with,

79
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:22,960
but for Kendrick music is a way to cope 
with an understand his world,

80
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:23,823
not the cause of its ills,
and this is where his second 

81
00:04:26,441 --> 00:04:27,274
collaborator comes in.
Three of the shots in elephant are 

82
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:32,350
direct references to the work of Gordon 
Parks.

83
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:35,780
One of America's all time great photo 
journalists and filmmakers.

84
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:36,813
Parks was the first prominent commercial
photographer to capture the black 

85
00:04:40,001 --> 00:04:40,834
experience for a nationwide audience is 
focused on the inner cities for life 

86
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:47,230
magazine was hugely important during 
that period,

87
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:48,064
and the power of his photography is that
it forces people to see what would 

88
00:04:51,641 --> 00:04:52,474
otherwise remain invisible to them.
Parks was heralded for his ability to 

89
00:04:55,931 --> 00:04:56,764
get close to his subjects,
to earn their trust so that he could 

90
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:01,570
eliminate the intimate truths of their 
lives.

91
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,390
I'll give a fuck.
I don't give a fuck.

92
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,980
I don't give up.
Don't give up.

93
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,053
Don't give a fuck

94
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:11,703
by citing parks.
Kendrick aligns their artistic goals he 

95
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,213
liked parks,
commits to depicting the realities of 

96
00:05:16,841 --> 00:05:17,674
his community with clear eyes,
even if that means depicting himself as 

97
00:05:21,101 --> 00:05:21,934
the product of a violent culture or a 
violent country or sometimes as someone 

98
00:05:26,171 --> 00:05:29,920
who perpetuates those things.
I'm not a big fan of music videos,

99
00:05:29,921 --> 00:05:30,754
but the way Kendrick brings the visions 
of Lindstrom and parks into sync with 

100
00:05:34,181 --> 00:05:35,014
his own,
his masterful the result of the 

101
00:05:36,551 --> 00:05:37,384
collaboration is a music video that 
operates a lot more like a poem that 

102
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:44,700
connects the song and the album's 
content with more touchstones,

103
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:45,653
not less element is a video that lets 
you look into Kendrick's world and in 

104
00:05:49,031 --> 00:05:53,440
the end for a brief terrifying moment,
forces you to see through its eyes.

105
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,090
Got It,
got the,

106
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:04,670
made it look sexy.
My element by element.

107
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:14,400
Hey everybody,
thank you so much for watching.

108
00:06:14,401 --> 00:06:17,220
This episode was brought to you by 
Casper mattresses.

109
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:20,190
There is a mattress in this box right 
now.

110
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,353
It's actually a really cool sponsorship 
for us because we needed a new mattress 

111
00:06:24,421 --> 00:06:26,610
in our bedroom and casper's are really 
comfortable.

112
00:06:26,611 --> 00:06:27,444
I had one when I was living in San 
Francisco and I've been meaning to get 

113
00:06:29,911 --> 00:06:30,301
one.
Anyway,

114
00:06:30,301 --> 00:06:33,390
it's a foam mattress that comes 
delivered in a box just like this,

115
00:06:33,391 --> 00:06:35,850
and when you open it,
it expands into the size.

116
00:06:35,851 --> 00:06:38,640
In this case of a Queen Mattress,
let me show you how it works.

117
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:40,020
Okay,
so this is insanely easy.

118
00:06:40,021 --> 00:06:43,050
You take the mattress out of the box 
like you can see me doing right here.

119
00:06:43,051 --> 00:06:43,884
You unfurl it on the bed frame and then 
just remove the vacuum sealed plastic 

120
00:06:46,081 --> 00:06:46,914
wrap and it expands.
The mattresses are obsessively 

121
00:06:49,111 --> 00:06:49,944
engineered to have the ideal amount of 
firmness and balance and it's foam 

122
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:54,204
layers.
It's super affordable because it's sold 

123
00:06:55,951 --> 00:06:56,784
directly to consumers.
You get free shipping and 100 day free 

124
00:06:58,861 --> 00:07:00,960
trial with no hassle returns.
If you're not happy,

125
00:07:00,961 --> 00:07:04,230
and if you go to casper.com
and use the offer code nerdwriter,

126
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,290
you can get $50 off the purchase of a 
mattress.

127
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:08,610
Thanks for the mattress,
Casper.

128
00:07:08,611 --> 00:07:09,870
I will see you guys next time.
