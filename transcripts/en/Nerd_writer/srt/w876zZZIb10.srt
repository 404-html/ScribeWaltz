1
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:07,590
It's likely that by now you've heard 
about movie pass,

2
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,730
the subscription service that allows you
to see one movie per day in theaters for

3
00:00:11,731 --> 00:00:13,140
$9,
95 a month,

4
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:14,430
except you can't see it will be more 
than once.

5
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:15,264
You have to be a hundred yards from the 
theater to book the ticket and during 

6
00:00:16,201 --> 00:00:17,520
certain times you have to pay a little 
extra,

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,000
but despite all that movie pass is still
a pretty good deal.

8
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:21,953
In fact,
the deal might be too good for moving 

9
00:00:23,701 --> 00:00:24,534
past,
just as you've probably heard about 

10
00:00:25,381 --> 00:00:26,214
movie pass,
you've probably also heard the company 

11
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:30,690
is losing money faster than a Tarantino.
Henchmen loses blood.

12
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,280
The problem is simple.
Movie past charges nine 95 a month,

13
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:38,700
and the average movie ticket and America
costs $9 and sixteen cents.

14
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:42,270
When you see a movie with movie pass,
they pay the full price of the ticket as

15
00:00:42,271 --> 00:00:44,700
if they were buying a normal ticket for 
a friend.

16
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,070
That means if you see just two movies a 
month,

17
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,790
movie passes losing double what a gains 
from you more.

18
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:53,580
If you're buying in a city where ticket 
prices are more expensive,

19
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:54,743
multiply that by $3,
million friends and you can see why 

20
00:00:57,121 --> 00:00:57,954
movie pass is in a lot of trouble 
financially according to the best 

21
00:01:00,571 --> 00:01:01,404
estimates.
The average movie pass subscriber sees 

22
00:01:02,701 --> 00:01:03,534
about one point five movies a month and 
even though that's not three movies or 

23
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,003
even to the numbers are still lopsided 
and that point five of a movie is 

24
00:01:11,851 --> 00:01:13,890
bleeding them dry.
In 2017,

25
00:01:13,891 --> 00:01:14,724
the company that owns movie pass,
Helios and Matheson lost a $150 million 

26
00:01:18,451 --> 00:01:19,284
dollars and in May the company revealed 
in an sec filing that it's losing 21 

27
00:01:22,981 --> 00:01:27,120
point $7,000,000
per month on average at that time and at

28
00:01:27,121 --> 00:01:27,954
that rate they only had enough cash 
available to stay solvent for two more 

29
00:01:30,811 --> 00:01:31,644
months.

30
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:35,760
It's two months later now and well,
the website still works,

31
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,820
so that's a good sign.
If you're consistently losing money as a

32
00:01:38,821 --> 00:01:39,654
business,
there's only one way to stay afloat by 

33
00:01:41,881 --> 00:01:42,714
finding investors to give you money in 
the hope that some day you'll be 

34
00:01:45,391 --> 00:01:46,224
profitable in the future.
Investors investing in spotify or uber 

35
00:01:49,771 --> 00:01:50,604
or dropbox or blue apron,
all companies that have yet to become 

36
00:01:53,671 --> 00:01:54,504
profitable,
in fact of the 108 companies that went 

37
00:01:56,731 --> 00:02:00,480
public in 2017,
over three quarters weren't profitable.

38
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,930
Now not all unprofitable companies are 
created equal.

39
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:04,913
Amazon was unprofitable for years,
but it had the revenue so it was just 

40
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:11,790
putting them back into investments.
In the case of movie pass,

41
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:16,380
the revenue just isn't enough to pay for
the costs and movie past says it,

42
00:02:16,381 --> 00:02:17,214
understands this.
It says it always knew it was going to 

43
00:02:19,441 --> 00:02:23,760
lose money on its path to acquiring more
subscribers and greater market share.

44
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,113
And to be fair,
the growth of the company has been 

45
00:02:26,611 --> 00:02:30,030
impressive.
Last August movie pass only had 20,000

46
00:02:30,031 --> 00:02:33,330
subscribers when they lowered their 
price to $10 a month,

47
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:34,493
almost a year later and they're 
approaching $3 million with projections 

48
00:02:37,411 --> 00:02:39,300
of up to 5 million by the end of the 
year.

49
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,273
The theory behind the price drop and the
reason they haven't yet raised it 

50
00:02:43,081 --> 00:02:43,914
substantially to stem their losses is 
that it's supposed to attract the 51 

51
00:02:47,431 --> 00:02:51,510
percent of movie goers who only see 
about three to six movies a year.

52
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,720
People who might pass on $20 or even $15
but can't resist 10 these people,

53
00:02:58,171 --> 00:02:59,004
the theory goes,
we'll bring the average movie per 

54
00:03:00,701 --> 00:03:01,534
subscriber down,
but movie pass needs to look for cash 

55
00:03:04,121 --> 00:03:04,954
and other places to.
The original idea was that it could use 

56
00:03:06,881 --> 00:03:07,714
the app to track the movie going habits 
of its users and sell that data to 

57
00:03:11,381 --> 00:03:15,400
studios for targeted advertising and to 
restaurants nearby the theater who could

58
00:03:15,401 --> 00:03:17,770
advertise to customers when they're in 
the area.

59
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,213
Movie pass,
things that eventually if it can grow 

60
00:03:21,251 --> 00:03:24,070
enough,
it can negotiate a percentage of the new

61
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:24,904
business.
It's bringing two theaters and the 

62
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:29,050
surrounding stores.
It thinks that it could potentially even

63
00:03:29,051 --> 00:03:33,610
get a slice of a theaters only real 
moneymaker concessions.

64
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:34,953
Let's see what the CEO of America's 
largest theater chain has to say about 

65
00:03:37,211 --> 00:03:37,930
that.

66
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:38,763
Absolutely no intention,
no intention of sharing any of our 

67
00:03:41,361 --> 00:03:44,160
admissions revenue or concession.
Terrific Bitch.

68
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,510
Okay.
I added that last part.

69
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,620
It was good to get to it.

70
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,630
Sure.
There are a lot of forces at work in the

71
00:03:50,631 --> 00:03:54,850
movie theater ecosystem and movie pass 
is laying them all bear.

72
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:55,963
People are seeing fewer movies overall,
so theater chains have been raising 

73
00:03:59,571 --> 00:04:00,404
ticket prices and higher ticket prices 
means people see fewer movies still and 

74
00:04:03,861 --> 00:04:07,910
don't take chances on what they do see 
at theaters have it hard as it is.

75
00:04:07,911 --> 00:04:11,810
Most ticket revenues get kicked back to 
the studios who leveraged their power to

76
00:04:11,811 --> 00:04:15,470
get even more percentage and now here 
comes the subscription service,

77
00:04:15,471 --> 00:04:16,304
the valuing the price of a ticket in the
minds of consumers asking for a cut of 

78
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:24,551
concessions and yet movie pass is 
bringing them business.

79
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,630
It's users are taking chances.
Again,

80
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:28,580
seeing movies on a whim.
Again,

81
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:31,550
it's bringing more people to the movies 
more often.

82
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:35,590
It's just not bringing enough people.
Not yet.

83
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,810
The studios don't want to pay for the 
data.

84
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:40,933
The theaters don't want to cut them in 
and movie pass subscribers are just 

85
00:04:44,491 --> 00:04:45,324
seeing too many movies.
If there's a size at which this would 

86
00:04:48,211 --> 00:04:49,044
all change,
20 million subscribers maybe or 50 

87
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:52,890
million or 100,
I don't know,

88
00:04:52,891 --> 00:04:57,891
but it's a race now can move you past,
get to that critical size before it runs

89
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:01,290
completely out of money.
I guess we'll see.

90
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:05,040
Until then.
It is genuinely one of the best deals in

91
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:05,874
town.
Something I thought I'd never see a 

92
00:05:08,191 --> 00:05:13,050
bunch of rich investors taking millions 
of people out to the movies.

93
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,760
Everybody.
Thank you so much for watching.

94
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:22,320
This episode was brought to you by 
skillshare and online learning community

95
00:05:22,321 --> 00:05:24,690
for creators,
but more than 18,000

96
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:28,260
classes and everything from graphic 
design to film editing,

97
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,250
finance it security.
You know,

98
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,093
when I learned photoshop,
I learned it through this mishmash of 

99
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:39,480
disconnected youtube videos and I think 
the process would have gone a lot faster

100
00:05:39,481 --> 00:05:40,314
if there was a class dedicated to 
teaching me everything about that 

101
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:43,884
program in a systematic way.
Learning new skills is really valuable 

102
00:05:46,951 --> 00:05:48,810
to me because whenever I learn a new 
skill,

103
00:05:48,811 --> 00:05:51,990
it's like a bunch of new ideas are 
suddenly unlocked in my head.

104
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:54,510
I think,
what can I do with this and that.

105
00:05:54,511 --> 00:05:57,410
Always always helps me with writer's 
block.

106
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,573
A premium membership begins around $10 a
month for unlimited access to all 

107
00:06:01,131 --> 00:06:01,964
courses,
but the first 500 people to sign up 

108
00:06:03,951 --> 00:06:04,784
using the link in the description below 
will get their first two months for 

109
00:06:07,641 --> 00:06:08,474
free,
and those two months you could easily 

110
00:06:09,381 --> 00:06:12,110
learn the skills you need to start a new
hobby or business.

111
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,183
More importantly,
the skills you learn will help give you 

112
00:06:14,901 --> 00:06:18,440
the ideas for what that business or our 
project could be.

113
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,270
Definitely try it out.
Thanks guys.

114
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,133
I'll see you next time.
