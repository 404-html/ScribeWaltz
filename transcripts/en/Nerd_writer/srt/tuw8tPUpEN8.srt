Okay.
Get ready to go.

3
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,660
Let the computer away.
Here's the keys.

4
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:25,740
Wallet.
You got the phone.

5
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:31,300
Got To get my nice shoes with them on.
Just ready to go.

6
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:35,260
Yeah.
Yeah.

7
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,320
I mean I just,
he's my friend now.

8
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,110
Right?
Ready to go.

9
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,090
It's bringing this up.
Joseph.

10
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:47,650
Much appreciate it.
Um,

11
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:53,190
until uh,
for 20,

12
00:00:53,921 --> 00:00:54,754
25,
30 years.

13
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,670
Thank you so much for us.
We really appreciate it.

14
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:58,983
Thank you.
I had to go get on the Lawrence 

15
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:05,290
O'donnell show.
You got the backstage pass.

16
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:10,700
Okay.
That'd be great.

17
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:11,780
Waterman.
Okay,

18
00:01:11,781 --> 00:01:12,421
cool.
Thank you.

19
00:01:12,421 --> 00:01:16,920
When you go see you in the green room 
for now and after he kicked me out,

20
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:19,543
mirror say is the right time to do the 
right thing and all those other 

21
00:01:22,021 --> 00:01:23,040
products.
It's Chris,

22
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:28,050
but I think a big news event would be 
like tsunami kind of thing.

23
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:29,453
That would be like,
you can't not talk about it the whole 

24
00:01:31,171 --> 00:01:32,820
time.
This is big.

25
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:37,140
This is big for MSNBC.
It's nice to be properly laid.

26
00:01:37,141 --> 00:01:40,690
I must say.
Oh No.

27
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,730
Television has a strange power.
Especially in American culture.

28
00:01:44,731 --> 00:01:45,564
It lends credibility,
instant credibility to people that 

29
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:51,710
sometimes don't want to.
Absolutely true.

30
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:59,150
Right.

31
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:02,993
Hello everyone.
I am here in the studio where I will be 

32
00:02:04,851 --> 00:02:06,600
recording.
Hello everyone.

33
00:02:06,601 --> 00:02:09,390
I'm here in the studio where we're.
Hello everyone.

34
00:02:09,391 --> 00:02:10,680
I'm here in the studio.
Where will we be?

35
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,550
Where I will be recording.
Hello everyone.

36
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:18,240
I'm here in the studio where I will be 
recording my segment on the last word.

37
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:21,750
This is a little studio that they,
they got us in right here.

38
00:02:21,751 --> 00:02:24,510
I got this earpiece in my ear.
I can hear the host,

39
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:25,344
Melissa Harris Perry talking right now.
That's the camera that we'll be filming 

40
00:02:28,771 --> 00:02:32,430
us and this is the little tvs where we 
are.

41
00:02:32,431 --> 00:02:33,264
I can see myself,
which I have asked them to turn off 

42
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:38,970
because as I said that my first flog,
I cannot not look at myself.

43
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,093
Um,
so we're waiting right now listening to 

44
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:44,460
Melissa do the show,
but she's going to,

45
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:45,810
uh,
uh.

46
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:47,183
Hi Evan.
How are you?

47
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,120
Good,
how are you,

48
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:48,953
Melissa?
Oh,

49
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:52,620
we were absolutely blown away by your 
video.

50
00:02:52,621 --> 00:02:53,454
Can I tell you?
We had been emailing it to one another 

51
00:02:54,901 --> 00:02:58,470
and playing it over and over again.
What inspired you to make it?

52
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,033
Well,

53
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:02,440
I was watching last night when Lauren 
said,

54
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,540
you know,
it was the simplicity of the idea and I,

55
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:09,610
I completely agree with that,
but I think it's that plus the fact that

56
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,130
it's something that you,
you don't think of,

57
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,263
you know,
and that's what struck me when I 

58
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:16,960
originally heard them announce it a year
ago on the show,

59
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,360
is it something that you never think of?
And so it sort of hits you in that,

60
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,180
that feel bad Oregon,
whatever that is.

61
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,313
And you,
you get that reflexive feeling like he 

62
00:03:26,111 --> 00:03:27,430
said last night to donate.

63
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:32,540
So it was uploaded five days ago and 
you've gotten more than 200,000

64
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:34,320
hits.
What is,

65
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:37,130
what has been the reaction you've been 
getting from people online who have seen

66
00:03:37,131 --> 00:03:37,610
it?

67
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:41,660
The reaction has been,
I use the word aggressively generous.

68
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:42,723
It is.
The comments just on the video has been 

69
00:03:45,021 --> 00:03:49,070
like donated.
They just say donate or they say,

70
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,093
you know,
I just took a kid off the floor and 

71
00:03:51,051 --> 00:03:54,550
Malawi.
And to know that you could possibly kind

72
00:03:54,551 --> 00:03:57,410
of do make that effect in the world by 
making a video is it,

73
00:03:57,411 --> 00:03:58,250
is truly incredible.

74
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:59,660
Now,
speaking of that,

75
00:03:59,661 --> 00:04:01,730
I mean it's a small,
small thing and desks.

76
00:04:01,731 --> 00:04:03,440
It's a small thing to make a video.
So.

77
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:06,680
So what is your ultimate goal though?
So you have this small thing,

78
00:04:06,681 --> 00:04:10,370
but then you have a video that 
Crescendos to winning the Nobel prize.

79
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:12,300
What was your Christian?
No,

80
00:04:12,301 --> 00:04:12,771
here.
What,

81
00:04:12,771 --> 00:04:14,300
what would you like this video to do?

82
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:17,920
What I would like it to do is it was a,
um,

83
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:20,140
it was a video for the project for 
awesome,

84
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:21,123
which is a youtube charity event that 
happens every year where people make 

85
00:04:25,001 --> 00:04:27,160
videos on the charity of their choice.
They submit them,

86
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:28,203
the community watches them.
It's hosted by John and Hank Green of 

87
00:04:30,701 --> 00:04:31,534
the vlog brothers.
We just have a lot of people at their 

88
00:04:32,771 --> 00:04:36,100
disposal online and we all donated to 
the project for awesome.

89
00:04:36,101 --> 00:04:36,934
I think it raised about $71,000.
And what we're waiting for now is the 

90
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:44,260
top voltage charities are going to get 
some of that money.

91
00:04:44,261 --> 00:04:47,140
They're going to be divvied up based on 
what the votes are and the ultimate goal

92
00:04:47,141 --> 00:04:47,974
for this is to get some more money for 
the kind fund because we could actually 

93
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:55,900
make a huge difference.
I'm getting getting classrooms,

94
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,800
you know,
not just kids,

95
00:04:56,801 --> 00:04:57,850
but classrooms off the floor.

96
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:01,780
Well,
and then the video is indeed awesome and

97
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:05,200
all I have absolutely no authority to do
so.

98
00:05:05,201 --> 00:05:06,034
I got to tell you,
that's a good enough video that I don't 

99
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,053
know.
Maybe somebody ought to be talking to 

100
00:05:09,731 --> 00:05:12,910
you here at Msnbc coming up.
That was a great video.

101
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:14,950
Thank you very much.
I appreciate it.

102
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,640
Thanks Evan Lawrence,
the entire last word team.

103
00:05:18,641 --> 00:05:20,140
All of us.
Thank you for your help.

104
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,560
Now you can find it.

105
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,440
Got It.
Thank you very much.

106
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,760
Have a nice day.
Okay.

107
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,900
Spot is over.
I'm sweating at the armpits.

108
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:31,410
You can't see because I'm wearing two 
shirts.

109
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,310
Let's,
let's get out here.

110
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,503
So we just finished building it.
Pacific television studios did the 

111
00:05:41,491 --> 00:05:42,720
segment.
I think it went great.

112
00:05:42,721 --> 00:05:44,880
I was really nervous.
It went by so fast.

113
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:47,400
She was really nice,
extremely,

114
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:48,743
you know,
gracious and I just tried to gracious 

115
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:51,863
back and I hope we watch it tonight and 
it looks good and you can't see the 

116
00:05:55,951 --> 00:05:56,784
sweat from under my arm.

117
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:03,790
So thank you very much for tuning in.
Back to the limo.
