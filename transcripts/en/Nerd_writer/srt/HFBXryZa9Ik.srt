1
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:04,910
Yeah,

2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:05,743
you often hear from people who don't 
live in New York City and having lived 

3
00:00:09,141 --> 00:00:09,974
in New York City that they couldn't live
in New York City because they're not 

4
00:00:13,251 --> 00:00:14,084
that kind of person.
That's always struck me as strange and 

5
00:00:16,431 --> 00:00:17,264
somewhat incomprehensible thing to say.
Being myself in New York City and 

6
00:00:20,751 --> 00:00:24,760
meeting everyday people who because they
live here must be that kind of person.

7
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:27,120
It's strange because taking together all
of them,

8
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:29,450
the web of their qualities and desires 
and flaws,

9
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,450
I can't quite envision the types who are
left out.

10
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:36,170
The thing is I don't trust them.
I don't trust that they haven't confused

11
00:00:36,171 --> 00:00:39,350
and idea of New York City for the real 
thing and for that matter,

12
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:43,040
I don't trust that they haven't confused
and idea of themselves.

13
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:43,903
For the real New York,
it's conventionally thought is big and 

14
00:00:46,011 --> 00:00:49,370
loud and fast and drunk.
Edit is those things

15
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:03,150
man,

16
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,233
but New York can be as small as it is 
big as quiet and slow as it is loud and 

17
00:01:20,651 --> 00:01:21,484
fast.
The city when viewed from within is 

18
00:01:22,781 --> 00:01:25,120
really a collection of peculiar 
neighborhoods,

19
00:01:25,121 --> 00:01:27,490
which is to say a collection of Charles 
is my friend now,

20
00:01:27,491 --> 00:01:29,560
this is Jerry.
Each has their own secrets.

21
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:30,453
Each has their own weird identities and 
each has their own set of random 

22
00:01:33,491 --> 00:01:36,280
accumulated rules like when the horses 
come out at 2:00

23
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,113
AM on Essex in the lower east side,
or when the wealthy folk go out to get 

24
00:01:39,311 --> 00:01:41,590
their brunch on Sunday mornings in the 
upper west,

25
00:01:41,591 --> 00:01:45,250
or how we all just assume that street 
meat is perfectly safe because it tastes

26
00:01:45,251 --> 00:01:46,870
so good.
Mustard,

27
00:01:46,871 --> 00:01:49,540
please copious amounts of mustard 
always,

28
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:51,223
always pagel.
These neighborhoods cohere around 

29
00:01:53,171 --> 00:01:54,004
equality common to all but by a kind of 
the consignee and family resemblance by 

30
00:01:57,551 --> 00:02:01,570
a series of overlapping similarities 
like the series of overlapping character

31
00:02:01,571 --> 00:02:04,990
traits that give to it's eight point 2 
million inhabitants,

32
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:09,610
a kindred bond and a bond that holds 
fast in tragedy and paint.

33
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,473
For me,
what makes being in New York City 

34
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:15,640
extraordinary is the feeling of standing
on the knife's edge of history.

35
00:02:15,641 --> 00:02:19,300
What it must've felt like to be at Rome 
during the caesars were at London in the

36
00:02:19,301 --> 00:02:20,134
height of empire.
It's as if you're surfing the wave of 

37
00:02:22,421 --> 00:02:26,560
time and you can see what's coming and 
you can see every expression of humanity

38
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:29,980
amplified and multiplied,
made stranger and more tolerant.

39
00:02:29,981 --> 00:02:33,040
New York overwhelms you into a kind of 
unceasing Oh,

40
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:36,370
and you could feel everything on every 
corner all the time.

41
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,323
There are a lot of hedonists in New York
City and a lot of good people that it 

42
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:42,790
may be the best place in the universe 
anyway.

43
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:45,250
It's the best place in the universe to 
get a drink at four in the morning.

44
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:46,920
Yep,
Yep.

45
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:47,883
Come in.
