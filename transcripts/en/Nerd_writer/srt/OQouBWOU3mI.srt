1
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:22,443
It's tempting to think of the ocean as a
domain of quiet or Jacques Cousteau 

2
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:30,100
himself,
called it the silent world,

3
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:34,810
but in fact,
the sea is full of noise.

4
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:39,880
Sea Mammals,
crustaceans,

5
00:00:39,881 --> 00:00:40,714
diving birds,
and a number of fish communicate with 

6
00:00:42,521 --> 00:00:44,110
pulses of sound.
Dolphins,

7
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:44,944
as we all know from the modern cinematic
masterpiece flipper use echolocation 

8
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,273
Dolphin's sonar.
So you flipped her sense of of sound 

9
00:00:52,781 --> 00:00:56,500
toward an object and receives an echo 
back he can see in total darkness.

10
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:58,413
Yeah,
about 20 million years after Dolphins 

11
00:01:00,431 --> 00:01:01,264
mastered echolocation.
It occurred to human beings that the 

12
00:01:03,401 --> 00:01:04,234
skill might have some use when a young 
man named Leonardo dicaprio drowned 

13
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,740
needlessly in the ocean following an 
unfortunate incident with the ship.

14
00:01:11,741 --> 00:01:16,741
I can't remember the name of sonar or 
sound navigation and ranging is only one

15
00:01:16,751 --> 00:01:17,584
of the ways that human beings have 
doubled noise levels in the ocean every 

16
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,753
decade since the mid 20th century.
What was once the exclusive domain of 

17
00:01:23,921 --> 00:01:27,070
clicks,
wines and whale songs is now throng with

18
00:01:27,071 --> 00:01:27,904
the thunder of ship propellers,
ultra loud naval sonar and seismic 

19
00:01:31,181 --> 00:01:35,560
surveys of oil and gas companies,
which blast air guns so loud,

20
00:01:35,561 --> 00:01:36,394
they penetrate kilometers into the ocean
floor so loud that they are a million 

21
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,870
times more intense than that.

22
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:43,733
Sounds good.

23
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,700
The effect of such deafening noise is 
devastating to the oceans ecosystem,

24
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:50,683
and by extension the world's at large.
It is particularly destructive to Wales 

25
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:58,160
who use low frequency noises to 
communicate across large distances,

26
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,263
trapped in that disorienting.
Could Kaufmanni whales swim dive 

27
00:02:01,951 --> 00:02:04,130
erratically,
radically causing decompression sickness

28
00:02:04,131 --> 00:02:04,964
and mass strandings on nearby beaches.
In July of this year of the Obama 

29
00:02:07,251 --> 00:02:08,084
administration authorized Seismic Aragon
testing for an unprecedented swath of 

30
00:02:12,141 --> 00:02:12,974
the Atlantic Ocean.
Something that government itself 

31
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:17,420
determined would injure more than 
138,000

32
00:02:17,421 --> 00:02:20,870
dolphins and whales,
including the North Atlantic right whale

33
00:02:20,871 --> 00:02:24,860
of which and where there are only a 
meager 500 left.

34
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:25,843
My charity for the 2014 project for 
awesome is the largest international 

35
00:02:30,111 --> 00:02:33,830
advocacy organization focused solely on 
ocean conservation.

36
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,840
They have the resources,
the coordination,

37
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:36,853
and a laundry list of victories against 
the admittedly huge interests that 

38
00:02:40,131 --> 00:02:42,740
degrade RC everyday.
You know,

39
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:43,663
100 years ago we had no fear that what 
we did could affect the vastness of the 

40
00:02:47,721 --> 00:02:51,530
ocean than a few of our bravest went up 
into space and the pictures they took,

41
00:02:51,531 --> 00:02:52,364
their gave us an urgent new perspective 
helping us to see that the world which 

42
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,550
made us could buy us the unmet.
