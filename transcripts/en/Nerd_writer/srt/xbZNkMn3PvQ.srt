1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,153
Mm,

2
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:19,370
I

3
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:23,600
think it's okay to start my analysis of 
Guillermo del Toro's,

4
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:28,190
Pan's labyrinth with a spoiler Ofelia 
the main character.

5
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:29,323
She dies at the end.
I feel fine doing that because del Toro 

6
00:00:33,411 --> 00:00:35,870
does the exact same thing with his 
movie.

7
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:36,983
The first shot of Pan's labyrinth is the
ending and it's also the first way in 

8
00:00:40,401 --> 00:00:44,360
which deltoro complicates that epic,
but before we get into that,

9
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:48,380
a few things about fairytales,
but for most of us,

10
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:53,410
the authoritative source for fairytales 
is Walt Disney and that's no accident.

11
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:57,290
Disney set out to claim that authority 
when he made films like snow,

12
00:00:57,291 --> 00:01:01,310
White Cinderella,
sleeping beauty by adapting folktales in

13
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:02,144
the public domain and copywriting the 
adaptations still because film was a 

14
00:01:06,051 --> 00:01:06,884
relatively new medium.
Capturing the authority he wanted 

15
00:01:09,381 --> 00:01:10,214
require Disney to remain faithful to the
original versions of these stories 

16
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:17,390
popularized by Charles perrow and the 
brothers Grimm.

17
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:18,583
He made the transition from print to 
cinema as smooth as possible for the 

18
00:01:21,651 --> 00:01:24,560
audience even going so far as to begin 
his movies.

19
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:27,740
With the opening of a book,
Disney was smart.

20
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:28,813
His films are now regarded as classics,
and yet by remaining so faithful to the 

21
00:01:32,841 --> 00:01:33,674
stories 19th century antecedents,
he inherited and furthered their 19th 

22
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:39,014
century morality,
a conservative patriarchal value system 

23
00:01:42,531 --> 00:01:46,000
in which the prince always comes to save
the helpless heroin,

24
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,850
a value system that was antiquated.
Even then in this way,

25
00:01:49,851 --> 00:01:54,851
Disney limited the kinds of things a 
fairytale can do in Pan's labyrinth.

26
00:01:55,941 --> 00:01:56,774
Guillermo del Toro attempts to explode 
these limitations and he does so by 

27
00:02:00,381 --> 00:02:02,270
recontextualizing.
These stories,

28
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:04,940
instead of pulling from a single 
authoritative source,

29
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:08,030
del Toro pulls from a huge number of 
sources,

30
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,013
giving none precedence over the others 
and letting them all play against one 

31
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:13,124
another to create meaning.
The film tells the story of the little 

32
00:02:15,561 --> 00:02:16,394
girl Ofelia and her mother Carmen,
as they go to live with the hyper 

33
00:02:19,551 --> 00:02:21,290
fascist to captain vidal.

34
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:22,363
Five years after the Spanish civil war,
the Dallas trying to sniff out the last 

35
00:02:25,641 --> 00:02:29,900
remnants of rebellion in the mountains,
awaiting his child's birth by Carmen.

36
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:30,973
While Ofelia becomes ensnared in a 
magical quest after a fond tells her 

37
00:02:35,031 --> 00:02:38,180
that she is the lost princess of an 
underground realm.

38
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,673
From here,
the story spins out into two parallel 

39
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:42,703
narratives,
the magical quest and the political 

40
00:02:44,811 --> 00:02:46,190
drama.
Crucially,

41
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:50,000
neither of these narratives becomes 
reducible to the other.

42
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:50,983
Del Toro makes a point of this by 
entwining them in ways that makes any 

43
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,980
totalizing explanation problematic.
At the end of the film,

44
00:02:57,981 --> 00:02:58,814
for example,
we get seems to be the nail in the 

45
00:03:00,671 --> 00:03:01,504
coffin for the magical quest,
but dol approaches Ofelia speaking with 

46
00:03:04,721 --> 00:03:07,420
the font and when the camera cuts to his
point of view,

47
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,673
the font is not there.
This appears to be solid evidence for 

48
00:03:10,871 --> 00:03:15,280
those who read Ofelia's quest as a 
coping mechanism for her set life,

49
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:16,503
but if we back up,
we can see how Deltoro complicates that 

50
00:03:19,691 --> 00:03:20,524
reading by remembering that the dol has 
just been drugged with a heavy dose of 

51
00:03:23,471 --> 00:03:25,510
sleeping medication.
In other stories,

52
00:03:25,511 --> 00:03:26,344
drug induced hallucinations are used to 
explain a way why people see the 

53
00:03:29,381 --> 00:03:31,780
supernatural,
but in Pan's labyrinth,

54
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,793
it's the opposite.
Del Toro uses the device to destabilize 

55
00:03:35,951 --> 00:03:39,070
our trust in Captain v Dot Dallas point 
of view here and elsewhere.

56
00:03:39,071 --> 00:03:44,071
The film refuses to obey our desire for 
an all encompassing explanation.

57
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,333
Of course,
disobedience is a major theme in this 

58
00:03:47,711 --> 00:03:48,544
film

59
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:54,250
I see,

60
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:00,873
whereas in many fairytales,
disobedience is the act that sets the 

61
00:04:03,551 --> 00:04:04,384
story in motion here.
Disobedience is framed as a vital and 

62
00:04:07,841 --> 00:04:08,674
important quality.
There's the disobedience of the rebels 

63
00:04:11,081 --> 00:04:13,450
who seek to free Spain from the grip of 
fascism,

64
00:04:13,451 --> 00:04:16,000
the disobedience of Mercedes,
who works with the rebels,

65
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,073
and of course the disobedience of Ofelia
who by turns questions and disregards 

66
00:04:21,341 --> 00:04:25,060
the commands of her mother,
the captain and the font,

67
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,073
but the most effective and I think 
impressive disobedience here is that 

68
00:04:29,441 --> 00:04:32,290
displayed within the very text of the 
movie,

69
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:35,830
and this is where del Toro's intense 
referencing comes into play.

70
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:38,980
The name of the game here is 
multiplicity,

71
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:39,993
undermining a single authoritarian 
master narrative like those champion by 

72
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,840
the dol and fascism in general by 
setting up a network of inter texts that

73
00:04:49,061 --> 00:04:53,470
make meaning a matter of choice.
I think of all the linking references in

74
00:04:53,471 --> 00:04:55,150
the pale man scene,
for example,

75
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,193
you have the ogre himself nodding to 
other child eating ogres and other 

76
00:04:58,811 --> 00:05:00,460
mythologies like krampus.

77
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,130
It also refers to the Greek Titan 
Kronos,

78
00:05:03,131 --> 00:05:06,580
who devoured his god.
Children in order to like fascist Spain,

79
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:10,000
keep the young from replacing them and 
coming into their own.

80
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,073
Also,
it should be noted that Kronos is the 

81
00:05:12,101 --> 00:05:12,934
title of Del Toro's first film,
one of many things that links his body 

82
00:05:16,121 --> 00:05:16,954
of work together.
The table itself links back to the 

83
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:19,384
banquet scene earlier in the film,
putting the Pale man in the same 

84
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:24,400
position as the Dell who will go on to 
kill a child.

85
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,293
The pile of shoes link forward and we'll
go on to recontextualize Ofelia's red 

86
00:05:29,081 --> 00:05:29,914
shoes itself,
a link to the wizard of Oz and the 1948 

87
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:37,630
film by Powell and Pressburger 
recontextualize as images reminiscent of

88
00:05:37,631 --> 00:05:42,631
the piles of clothes from Nazi 
concentration camps and the scene itself

89
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,120
functions as a metaphor for how beauty,
like say,

90
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,013
the beauty of old fairytales can enchant
us into certain lines and ways of 

91
00:05:51,161 --> 00:05:53,650
thinking that may not be in our 
interest.

92
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:55,503
Here you have constructed a vast network
of citation that reaches elsewhere in 

93
00:05:59,571 --> 00:06:00,404
the film and outside of it.
The lines of that network are for the 

94
00:06:03,831 --> 00:06:08,630
viewers to follow as they see fit.
Del Toro laces these references together

95
00:06:08,631 --> 00:06:09,464
with camera work and editing to achieve 
a narrative momentum that's undeniable 

96
00:06:13,401 --> 00:06:14,234
when you watch his movies.
It was the purpose of the doll like it 

97
00:06:18,201 --> 00:06:19,034
is the purpose of all authoritarian 
regimes or patriarchal moralistic 

98
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:23,563
fairytales to limit the number and kinds
of stories that can be told from a set 

99
00:06:28,371 --> 00:06:32,780
of facts or events.
Indeed limited to one story.

100
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:38,620
The only thing for us is to disobey you.
In old fairytales.

101
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:43,010
The stories were closed out in contained
by two words.

102
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,280
The end adult touros genius is to use 
perhaps this most formulaic genre of all

103
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:54,760
and disobey our expectations and how it 
should unfold and how it should end.

104
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:55,663
The rebels capture and kill the doll,
but Spain will continue under 

105
00:06:59,241 --> 00:07:03,740
authoritarian dictatorship for 30 years.
Ophelia is murdered,

106
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:07,400
but completes her quest and returns to 
the underground realm.

107
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:11,360
Or you can read that as a poetic ending 
to a sad story,

108
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:12,403
but happy ending to a fairytale or 
Ophelia's final choice of the story she 

109
00:07:17,181 --> 00:07:21,080
wants to tell for and about herself.
Of course,

110
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,020
she doesn't have

111
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:22,853
to choose at all.
No single story could contain her for 

112
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:30,360
even when she returned to the world of 
magic,

113
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:35,820
it has said she left small traces of her
time on earth,

114
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,100
visible to those who know where

115
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:40,470
and how to look.

116
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,400
Hey everybody,
thanks for watching.

117
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:51,443
Pan's labyrinth has been one of my 
favorite movies since I saw it in 

118
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:56,370
theaters,
so this was just a blast to make.

119
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:57,683
If this is the type of content that you

123
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,950

possible and keeps it going.

124
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:14,190
So I'm going to Paris for the next 
couple weeks.

125
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:15,263
I might miss a week.
I'm talking to you from the past right 

126
00:08:17,251 --> 00:08:20,070
now,
but if I don't see you next Wednesday,

127
00:08:20,071 --> 00:08:21,690
I'll see you the Wednesday after that.
