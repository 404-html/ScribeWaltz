00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,120
Goodbye Philadelphia and goodbye family.
Hello coffee on a Tuesday in hd.

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:11,270
Well,
so last week,

3
00:00:21,301 --> 00:00:26,130
48 civilian protesters were killed in 
Tahrir Square Cairo in Egypt.

4
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,790
Two thousand nine months ago.
The square looked like this.

5
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,033
So what happened?
Maybe you know the story of ancient 

6
00:00:37,731 --> 00:00:40,010
Egypt.
Maybe Mr Greg spent three whole weeks on

7
00:00:40,011 --> 00:00:43,340
it in fifth grade and you learned about 
Pharaohs and Hieroglyphics and pyramids,

8
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:44,323
which you later made for a project out 
of foam board or cardboard or sugar 

9
00:00:47,921 --> 00:00:50,540
cubes or cheats at the very least.
You know

10
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,793
a young man,
he never thought in people's standard 

11
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,530
feed the boy

12
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:00,703
and maybe you thought all that was 
fascinated with the story of modern 

13
00:01:03,231 --> 00:01:04,064
Egypt is just as incredible and it's so 
much at the heart of the cultural shift 

14
00:01:06,531 --> 00:01:07,364
happening in the Middle East right now 
that we ought to get an idea of how it 

15
00:01:09,741 --> 00:01:10,574
goes.
Well,

16
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:15,730
it goes like this.
The man looks and Egyptian military cask

17
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:20,900
held power in Egypt from 1250 to 1517 
when the Turks,

18
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:21,883
the Ottoman Empire bitch him out and 
took control and he kept it until 1798 

19
00:01:25,491 --> 00:01:28,100
when Napoleon bitched them.
And finally in 18,

20
00:01:28,101 --> 00:01:28,934
oh,
one napoleon himself was bitched by the 

21
00:01:30,531 --> 00:01:31,364
Brits.
The Brits were only there because the 

22
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:33,770
French war,
so when the French were expelled,

23
00:01:33,771 --> 00:01:35,900
the Brits left to eating a vacuum of 
power,

24
00:01:35,901 --> 00:01:38,420
which the Turks and the mamluks jumped 
to fill.

25
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:40,400
In the end,
it was neither work nor Mamluk who seize

26
00:01:40,401 --> 00:01:41,234
control,
but rather an Albanian commander who 

27
00:01:42,831 --> 00:01:45,980
played the two against each other called
Mohammed Ali.

28
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,290
No,
not that one or that one.

29
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:51,260
That one here is the beginning of modern
Egypt.

30
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:55,310
18 Ali began reforming the country into 
a modern state building.

31
00:01:55,311 --> 00:01:57,140
It's military,
it's industry,

32
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:58,003
and it's educated bureaucracy basically 
from scratch it more than any man ever 

33
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:01,754
had for Egypt,
single handedly sparking the Arab 

34
00:02:03,951 --> 00:02:04,784
renaissance or the Alda.
He won some battles and gain some 

35
00:02:07,491 --> 00:02:09,950
territory and lost some battles and lost
some territory.

36
00:02:09,951 --> 00:02:11,810
He got older,
he got paranoid.

37
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,590
He went crazy and he died.
His son assuming power.

38
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,433
Then he died shortly after his nephew 
assumed power and he was killed in his 

39
00:02:17,961 --> 00:02:18,794
fourth son.
Then his grandson and his great 

40
00:02:20,151 --> 00:02:21,660
grandson,
lesser men.

41
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:24,440
By the 18 eighties,
Egypt had become completely dependent on

42
00:02:24,441 --> 00:02:25,274
England and France for a healthy economy
and when they tried to break away 

43
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:27,943
England,
sent in its forces and occupied the 

44
00:02:29,361 --> 00:02:30,194
country,
state under occupation until after the 

45
00:02:31,581 --> 00:02:32,320
first world war.

46
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,430
When the war party led by sod,
so cool.

47
00:02:34,431 --> 00:02:35,264
Ask for independence from Britain,
something they thought they had been 

48
00:02:37,641 --> 00:02:42,641
promised for their sacrifice in the war.
They exiled to go to Malta,

49
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:47,720
and this sparked a grassroots uprising,
the revolution of 1919.

50
00:02:47,721 --> 00:02:48,554
The result of this was the official 
independence of Egypt in 1992 and the 

51
00:02:51,681 --> 00:02:54,050
drafting of the Constitution a year 
later,

52
00:02:54,051 --> 00:02:57,950
but their independence was largely in.
The agent was now a monarchy with a king

53
00:02:57,951 --> 00:03:00,720
backed by the British and subservient to
the British Consulate,

54
00:03:00,721 --> 00:03:01,554
Jim.
He died before World War Two and was 

55
00:03:02,531 --> 00:03:05,300
replaced with 16 year old King Farouk.
The.

56
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:10,030
This guy was a British puppet.
The Brits used Egypt as a base of allied

57
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:13,120
operations all throughout World War II 
propaganda from Germany,

58
00:03:13,121 --> 00:03:17,470
the Soviet Union and the United States 
all added to anti British.

59
00:03:17,471 --> 00:03:20,980
Sent them in 1948 Egypt blunder through 
the Arab Israeli war,

60
00:03:20,981 --> 00:03:21,814
losing 78 percent of Palestine and the 
process the country blamed you guessed 

61
00:03:25,181 --> 00:03:26,014
it for the movement called the Free 
Officers led by Mohammed the grief and 

62
00:03:29,141 --> 00:03:29,530
the mall.

63
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:32,770
Nasir orchestrated a military coup in 
1952,

64
00:03:32,771 --> 00:03:33,604
Egypt's second 20th century revolution.
They overthrew for root tossed away the 

65
00:03:36,881 --> 00:03:40,190
1923 constitution and declared Egypt a 
Repub,

66
00:03:40,191 --> 00:03:44,680
setting up a one party system made of 
all three officers called the liberation

67
00:03:44,681 --> 00:03:45,910
route.
Now Gleam was declared,

68
00:03:45,911 --> 00:03:48,770
the first president of Uja drafted a new
constitution,

69
00:03:48,771 --> 00:03:49,604
a secular in nature,
which a group called the Muslim 

70
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:52,870
Brotherhood apoe.
Two years later,

71
00:03:52,871 --> 00:03:56,170
the Muslim Brotherhood was outlawed as 
an illegal political organization.

72
00:03:56,171 --> 00:03:57,004
Two years after that,
and the Gui was replaced with Nasser as 

73
00:03:59,081 --> 00:04:01,960
the second president of Egypt,
and his first action was to announce the

74
00:04:01,961 --> 00:04:05,440
nationalization of the Suez Canal is a 
manmade canal,

75
00:04:05,441 --> 00:04:06,274
was a trade super highway for the middle
of England and France were pissed 

76
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:09,874
because they use the canal so much that 
they hatched a plan with Israel to 

77
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:14,573
overflow.

78
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:25,250
Naval Base Britain prepares well.
The worst crisis,

79
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:28,960
it was a secret plan at a stupid plant 
and they should have told the US because

80
00:04:28,961 --> 00:04:30,790
when I found out he was pissed,

81
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:34,670
not consulted in any way about any phase
of these actions.

82
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,450
Wes was like,
get the fuck out of their service.

83
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:42,310
Prestige was cemented by a proxy victory
of the Suez Canal crisis.

84
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,173
He rolled for another 18 years,
promoted pan Arab Islam all throughout 

85
00:04:46,061 --> 00:04:48,490
his term lead the six day war against 
Israel,

86
00:04:48,491 --> 00:04:52,210
which he lost embarrassingly and then he
died quietly,

87
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:57,010
is vice president Anwar Sadat succeeded 
him as the third president of Egypt,

88
00:04:57,011 --> 00:05:00,430
so that's most notable accomplishment 
was his participation in the camp.

89
00:05:00,431 --> 00:05:04,720
David accords with President Carter and 
Prime Minister David Ben Gurion,

90
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,930
which led to the eventual peace treaty 
with Israel Treaty,

91
00:05:07,931 --> 00:05:08,764
which is still honored today,
but Sudan and Egypt were ostracized for 

92
00:05:11,231 --> 00:05:12,064
this from the Arab League.
Opposition came at them from all sides 

93
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,880
and during a military parade on the 
sixth of October,

94
00:05:15,881 --> 00:05:16,714
1981 for assassins broke through the 
barricades and killed his vice 

95
00:05:20,201 --> 00:05:23,440
president.
Hosni Mubarak assume power as the fourth

96
00:05:23,441 --> 00:05:24,274
and last president of Egypt.
Mubarak maintain the peace agreement 

97
00:05:26,771 --> 00:05:27,604
with Israel while salvaging Egypt's 
relationship with the Arab Lee being 

98
00:05:31,091 --> 00:05:31,780
readmitted.

99
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:32,613
In 1989,
he privatized much of the economy and 

100
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:37,330
Egypt saw extreme growth in the 19 
nineties,

101
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,830
partly due to the $14,000,000,000,
had gotten debt relief for participation

102
00:05:41,831 --> 00:05:42,664
in the Gulf War,
but Mubarak was an autocrat like sedans 

103
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:51,300
before him and Nasir before him.
He reigned unchallenged for 26 years and

104
00:05:52,031 --> 00:05:55,840
in the first election that saw a second 
candidate in 2005.

105
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:57,250
That candidate,
Amen.

106
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,133
Our was imprisoned and we can forget 
that Egypt has been under emergency law 

107
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,103
since 1967,
which is spends constitutional rights 

108
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:10,100
legalize the censorship and extends 
police powers under Mubarak.

109
00:06:10,101 --> 00:06:10,934
There were repeated occurrences of 
police brutality and severe corruption 

110
00:06:13,821 --> 00:06:14,654
among government officials who were 
hoarding massive amounts of wealth for 

111
00:06:18,081 --> 00:06:18,914
themselves.
By 2011 after a severe worldwide 

112
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:22,003
economic crisis,
the emotion came to a head and we 

113
00:06:24,201 --> 00:06:25,034
watched day by day as protestors storm 
tower your square and demanded Mubarak 

114
00:06:29,361 --> 00:06:31,430
stepped down.
After 29 years

115
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,630
inspired by a popular uprising in 
Tunisia,

116
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:35,493
thousands of Egyptians took to the 
streets demanding the alto of president 

117
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:39,683
postnatal.

118
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:42,430
Oh,
800 years of history.

119
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,083
You can see how Egypt has just a how it 
moved from a tribal state to assault in 

120
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,253
it to a kingdom to republic.
You can see in Egypt the weight of 

121
00:06:53,261 --> 00:06:54,094
Middle Eastern history as it tries to 
crash on the shore of freedom and 

122
00:06:57,371 --> 00:06:58,204
democracy,
but you can also see that their history 

123
00:06:59,261 --> 00:07:00,094
is one of blood and ferment,
lit exclusively by military leaders and 

124
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:06,880
always in flow well,
it's the military who has control,

125
00:07:06,881 --> 00:07:08,150
again,
as the interim leaders,

126
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,500
a Supreme Council of Twenty generals 
postpones,

127
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:15,280
a civilian rule government to the dismay
of many protests begin again.

128
00:07:15,281 --> 00:07:17,830
Dozens have been killed,
the council and apologizes,

129
00:07:17,831 --> 00:07:18,664
but it falls on deaf ears.
Monday saw the start of a long process 

130
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:22,474
of parliamentary elections,
which won't deliver a new president 

131
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:27,580
until mid to late 2012.
In the meantime,

132
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:30,130
the counsel stays in charge who will 
step forward.

133
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:30,993
The Muslim Brotherhood made legal again 
after 57 years and sure to be a big 

134
00:07:34,091 --> 00:07:36,250
winner in the first round of 
parliamentary election.

135
00:07:36,251 --> 00:07:38,230
Will it be leftists,
revolutionaries,

136
00:07:38,231 --> 00:07:39,064
or just successes and Mu Bar?
Nobody really knows how it's all going 

137
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:42,044
to turn out,
but maybe this is the most important 

138
00:07:43,781 --> 00:07:44,614
statistic.
It's how much 40 percent of Egypt makes 

139
00:07:48,071 --> 00:07:49,930
per day.
Egyptians want change,

140
00:07:49,931 --> 00:07:54,931
but they need stability and with change 
there is no stability and with stability

141
00:07:55,151 --> 00:07:55,984
there is little change.
How do they find democracy and who will 

142
00:07:59,801 --> 00:08:04,801
be the stewards of revolution in Egypt 
and the movement and the movement called

143
00:08:04,931 --> 00:08:09,931
the three officers led by Muhammad and 
the movement and the movement called the

144
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,300
Free Officers led by Mohammad.
