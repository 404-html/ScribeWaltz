1
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:07,880
You try to preserve a fleeting moments 
well,

2
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:12,070
depends what you call bleeding.
Sometimes a geologic sense,

3
00:00:12,071 --> 00:00:16,310
the years of a pretty woman and 
sometimes with the people,

4
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,170
the 25th of a second

5
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:20,003
these days,
you're most likely to see the work of 

6
00:00:21,811 --> 00:00:22,644
American photographer,
ansell Adams on a postcard or on the 

7
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:27,624
wall of your boss's office.
His photographs are so ubiquitous now 

8
00:00:30,961 --> 00:00:31,794
that it's easy to walk by them without 
noticing their technical anesthetic 

9
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,540
mastery.
Indeed,

10
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:38,910
thanks to things like instagram and 
snapchat,

11
00:00:38,911 --> 00:00:39,744
photographs in general are so ever 
present in our lives that standards 

12
00:00:43,141 --> 00:00:43,974
about what we believe to be great work 
in this field are drowned out by the 

13
00:00:47,551 --> 00:00:51,150
literally billions of photos that are 
uploaded to the services.

14
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:54,350
Every day I come across something that 
excites me.

15
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:00,380
I see the picture in my mind is high and
I make the photograph and then I give it

16
00:01:00,381 --> 00:01:03,810
to you as the equivalent of help.
In the beginning,

17
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,673
ansell Adams took photographs.
Not unlike all those millions of us on 

18
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:11,040
instagram as a visual diary of his 
experience,

19
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,173
Adams took his first Brownie box camera 
on trips to the Sierra Nevada mountains 

20
00:01:15,631 --> 00:01:18,270
to place that wouldn't throw him for the
rest of his life.

21
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:22,410
His early photographs are enthusiastic,
but uninspired.

22
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,393
Adam had that feeling that I have every 
single time I pick up a still camera of 

23
00:01:27,301 --> 00:01:30,930
not getting in the print.
What I see with my eyes.

24
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:32,323
Now,
this is largely because of the dynamic 

25
00:01:33,361 --> 00:01:34,194
range of the human eye.
The brightest and darkest thing it can 

26
00:01:36,511 --> 00:01:40,380
see at the same time exceeds any film or
Digital Camera,

27
00:01:40,381 --> 00:01:43,260
especially those answers was using in 
the early 20th century,

28
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:46,500
but this all changed friends on April 
10th,

29
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:47,940
19,
27.

30
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:50,430
The footage you're watching right now is
from an excursion.

31
00:01:50,431 --> 00:01:52,620
Adams took with his future wife,
Virginia,

32
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:55,020
to the half dome in Yosemite National 
Park,

33
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,920
holding his corona view camera,
two lenses to filters,

34
00:01:58,921 --> 00:02:02,010
a heavy wouldn't tripod and 12 class 
plates.

35
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,143
He made his way onto the so-called 
diving board where you can look along 

36
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:06,803
the side of the massive granite dome.
And here Adams had a vision of what he 

37
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:15,831
wanted his image to look like.
He cites this as his first conscious use

38
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:16,703
of the technique called visualization,
the whole key live specifically in 

39
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:25,950
seeing it to the mind's eye,
which we call it visualization.

40
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,650
First,
Adam's tried his yellow filter.

41
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,753
This is the image it produced similar 
probably to what Adam saw looking 

42
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:33,444
through the camera's viewfinder,
but it's not what he visualized in his 

43
00:02:36,091 --> 00:02:38,460
mind's eye.
There was no excitement in the frame,

44
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:41,130
so he took out his red filter for a 
second shot.

45
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,570
He said the exposure at [inaudible] and 
expose the plate for five seconds.

46
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,150
When Adam's developed this photo and it 
his internal visualization,

47
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:03,910
he knew that this was his life's 
calling,

48
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,283
and look at the difference,
it makes the darkened sky charges the 

49
00:03:07,481 --> 00:03:10,450
image with drama and intensity in 
contrast,

50
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:13,870
and Adams had an instinctive genius 
about tonal balance.

51
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:14,733
In contrast,
and to formalize this craft to ensure 

52
00:03:16,511 --> 00:03:18,670
that he could achieve his 
visualizations.

53
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:19,803
He developed another tool with his 
friend Fred Archer called the zone 

54
00:03:23,021 --> 00:03:26,380
system.
The zone system splits the full range of

55
00:03:26,381 --> 00:03:27,214
black to white into 11 separate zones,
each one f stop or aperture setting 

56
00:03:31,781 --> 00:03:34,330
apart.
The photographer spot meter is different

57
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:38,530
elements in his frame and determines 
where everything fits in the zones.

58
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,690
This way,
the photographer has a sense of what his

59
00:03:40,691 --> 00:03:41,524
entire frame will look like before he 
shoots knowing how everything will 

60
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:48,550
change with different exposures.
To take a look at Adam's famous photo of

61
00:03:48,551 --> 00:03:51,700
the tetons and the snake river taken in 
1942.

62
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:55,210
The contrast here is really incredible 
and to get a better sense of it.

63
00:03:55,211 --> 00:03:56,044
Let's pixelate the image.
Look how Adams represents basically 

64
00:03:58,721 --> 00:04:02,260
every zone in the system all the way 
from zone zero,

65
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:03,123
full black in the shadow of the 
mountains here to zone 10 in the light 

66
00:04:06,821 --> 00:04:07,654
reflecting off the river.
What's even more extraordinary is his 

67
00:04:09,881 --> 00:04:14,290
ability to capture the highlight detail 
in the clouds and elsewhere on the river

68
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:17,830
and the shadow details and the trees 
that covered the bank.

69
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:23,440
Perhaps music is the most expressive.
However,

70
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:30,260
as a photographer,
I believe that a photography practice in

71
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:36,580
terms of quality may also reveal endless
horizons,

72
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,593
meaning

73
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:39,843
ansell Adams work,
his devotion to craft and more 

74
00:04:42,221 --> 00:04:45,640
importantly,
intention in photography is an important

75
00:04:45,641 --> 00:04:50,530
example in our time when there are more 
pictures posted in six months than there

76
00:04:50,531 --> 00:04:55,480
are stars in the Milky Way Galaxy.
Having fought so hard for the acceptance

77
00:04:55,481 --> 00:04:56,314
of photography as an art,
Adams probably would've laughed at a 

78
00:04:59,321 --> 00:05:02,590
statistic like that today.
Everyone has a camera,

79
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,890
but how many visualize what they're 
going to capture beforehand?

80
00:05:05,891 --> 00:05:06,724
How many measure the light or hike for a
day to reach the perfect spot so the 

81
00:05:11,321 --> 00:05:15,460
next time you walk by one of Ansell 
Adams photographs in the hallway of your

82
00:05:15,461 --> 00:05:19,780
doctor's office,
take a longer look and remember that our

83
00:05:19,781 --> 00:05:23,770
photographic world is the one he gave 
us.

84
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:27,130
Anything that excites me is that within 
not too many years,

85
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:30,690
we're going to have a title,
a new medium of expression that they hit

86
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:34,570
me and I know the potentials are there.
I don't want to be wonderful.

87
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:38,630
Hey everybody.
Thanks for watching.

88
00:05:38,631 --> 00:05:39,464
I love insulate them.
Such a good hearted person and a great 

89
00:05:43,161 --> 00:05:44,810
artist and I had so much fun making 
this,

90
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:46,790
a lot of cool things that I was 
experimenting with here,

91
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,073
which is what I love to do.
I just love to experiment with editing 

92
00:05:50,031 --> 00:05:52,730
and try to give you something that I 
hope you haven't seen before on Youtube.

93
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:53,803
Um,
so if you want to help support this 

94
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:55,604
channel,
you can go right here and go to my 

95
00:05:56,571 --> 00:05:58,940
patrion page,
pledge a dollar or $3 per video.

96
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,013
Everything helps.
You guys have been amazing and I will 

97
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:03,750
see you guys next Wednesday for 
something new.

98
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:04,913
I'm excited.
