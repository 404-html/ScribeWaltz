00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,820
Congrats to the Baltimore Ravens,
you guys suck,

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:05,940
but you want a coffee or a Tuesday and 
Vlog 48.

3
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,330
So when I finished the sixth grade and 
was ready to make the big move,

4
00:00:20,331 --> 00:00:22,040
did junior high.
My parents said,

5
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:22,970
you know,
Evan,

6
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:26,810
elementary school was easy,
but next year junior high,

7
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,850
it's not going to be so easy.
Next year is going to be hot,

8
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:30,703
so I steeled my 11 year old self and 
brace for junior high with a certain 

9
00:00:33,111 --> 00:00:35,930
figure and expectation that life has so 
far been a light breeze,

10
00:00:35,931 --> 00:00:36,764
but now that was over there was going to
be a certain fundamental change and 

11
00:00:39,371 --> 00:00:41,450
things in that change would be for the 
worse.

12
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:42,650
Well,
seventh grade came in,

13
00:00:42,651 --> 00:00:45,650
seventh grade went and when I opened my 
eyes,

14
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,320
everything was still pretty simple and 
pretty easy.

15
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,300
Things really hadn't changed that 
summer.

16
00:00:50,301 --> 00:00:51,260
My parents said,
you know,

17
00:00:51,261 --> 00:00:53,000
Evan,
seventh grade was easy,

18
00:00:53,001 --> 00:00:54,520
but eighth grade,
whoa,

19
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:57,200
things are going to get serious now.
Get ready.

20
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:58,820
Eighth grade came and went that summer.

21
00:00:58,820 --> 00:00:59,653
My parents warned me about high school,
but by that time I had come to believe 

22
00:01:02,331 --> 00:01:05,840
that they were pretty unreliable sources
in this particular field.

23
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:06,703
Nonetheless,
they kept saying so every year through 

24
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:12,370
high school and college and every year I
couldn't help but almost believed them,

25
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,780
but every year they were wrong.
Now,

26
00:01:14,781 --> 00:01:15,614
to be very clear,
I am not implying in any way that I'm 

27
00:01:17,991 --> 00:01:20,300
gifted or smarter than the average 
person.

28
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,180
The whole point of the nerd writer is 
that I'm not,

29
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:26,060
but I never did do much work in school.
I never did try very hard.

30
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:29,210
I found despite my parents' warnings,
that I didn't need to.

31
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:30,103
I often joke with friends that in school
I studied the teachers and not the 

32
00:01:33,561 --> 00:01:34,394
subjects and it's true.
If I deconstructed the personalities of 

33
00:01:36,681 --> 00:01:39,530
the great givers of how they were to 
test and awarded points,

34
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:40,573
I could construct my own personality and
word my own answers in a way that was 

35
00:01:44,511 --> 00:01:46,540
complimentary and that's how I got 
through.

36
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:50,210
I think I saw even at a young age that 
reality was fluid.

37
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:52,760
It was in constant,
which made it flexible.

38
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:56,150
A huge number of the rules of society 
were convention.

39
00:01:56,151 --> 00:01:56,984
They were as alterable as people were 
persuadable at the risk of self 

40
00:02:00,381 --> 00:02:03,110
psychoanalysis.
I think this comes in large part from my

41
00:02:03,111 --> 00:02:07,280
dad who is in a word in cordial.
He's a born Hagler,

42
00:02:07,281 --> 00:02:08,114
unwilling to believe that something 
can't be done until these strided 

43
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,590
himself.
It's a great quality,

44
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:13,453
but enough about me.
Is this just all in my head or is there 

45
00:02:15,561 --> 00:02:17,230
some truth to this id?
Well,

46
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,113
in the end,
what we're really talking about is 

47
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:21,830
evolution.
We're talking about intuition,

48
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:22,723
reason morality.
We're talking about the way people were 

49
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:29,420
early in Plato's Republic,
a dialogue about justice and the perfect

50
00:02:29,421 --> 00:02:30,254
society.
The precocious young glaucon puts a 

51
00:02:32,001 --> 00:02:34,280
question to socrates worded in the 
popular,

52
00:02:34,281 --> 00:02:35,960
would you rather style it's this?

53
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:36,823
Would you rather be an honest and fair 
person and have everyone believe that 

54
00:02:39,501 --> 00:02:40,334
you're a liar and the Douche bag,
or would you rather be a liar and a 

55
00:02:43,731 --> 00:02:44,564
douchebag and have everyone believed 
that you're a fair and honest and 

56
00:02:47,241 --> 00:02:49,850
wonderful person?
Now it's Plato's prerogative to prove to

57
00:02:49,851 --> 00:02:53,150
glaucon that being good is better than 
seeming good.

58
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,013
That our minds are perfect reasoning 
machines meant to find truth and master 

59
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,820
the lowly passions despite the 
reputational costs,

60
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:01,863
and that in truth is happiness.
Glaucon like a good little bitch is 

61
00:03:04,511 --> 00:03:06,460
eventually brought around,
but to be fair,

62
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:11,020
socrates is a master debater and what 
he's saying sounds good,

63
00:03:11,021 --> 00:03:15,460
but the reality of humanity is somewhat 
different than Plato's idea of the truth

64
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:20,050
about us is that our minds are less 
equipped for reasoning than they are for

65
00:03:20,051 --> 00:03:20,884
justification.
A number of studies by moral 

66
00:03:22,511 --> 00:03:23,344
psychologist Robert Howard Margolis and 
Jonathan Haidt show us that intuitions 

67
00:03:27,851 --> 00:03:28,684
and emotions rule that when in contact 
with anything we react instantaneously 

68
00:03:33,431 --> 00:03:36,910
for or against that thing,
and our reason goes to work,

69
00:03:36,911 --> 00:03:37,744
looking not for the truth,
but for a way to justify what we've 

70
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:41,410
already decided.

71
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:45,010
Ever try telling someone they're wrong 
about something flat out well.

72
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:45,903
Your tone has already defeated.
Your purpose of that person senses 

73
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:49,443
confrontation.
Their whole being will turn away from 

74
00:03:51,371 --> 00:03:52,204
you,
the smart little politician in their 

75
00:03:53,411 --> 00:03:54,244
head.
The reason that Plato imagines is 

76
00:03:55,691 --> 00:03:58,150
working to find the truth instead goes 
to work.

77
00:03:58,151 --> 00:03:58,984
Finding the reasons why your wrong.
We've evolved to become outstandingly 

78
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:03,124
adept at justifying our intuitions and 
it explains a lot why we argue when 

79
00:04:06,611 --> 00:04:09,040
we're wrong,
why we forgive good looking people their

80
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:13,300
flaws and vice versa,
why we lie and omit and carefully carved

81
00:04:13,301 --> 00:04:15,490
the versions of ourselves that we show 
to others.

82
00:04:15,491 --> 00:04:16,324
Simply the evolutionary advantages of 
discovering the truth are less than the 

83
00:04:19,751 --> 00:04:23,410
evolutionary advantages of having a good
reputation glaucon,

84
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,393
who in the end would rather be a liar 
that everyone likes has got us pinned 

85
00:04:27,671 --> 00:04:30,580
more accurately than even the great 
plato.

86
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:33,250
To know these things gives one a great 
power.

87
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,710
You're likely to get more out of life if
like my dad,

88
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,753
you haggle with reality,
addressing someone's intuitions or 

89
00:04:39,461 --> 00:04:42,880
emotions will more readily yield the 
results that you want from them.

90
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:46,360
People are fluid.
Reality is people.

91
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,350
Reality is fluid.
There is an insidious side to this and I

92
00:04:50,351 --> 00:04:52,300
think you could hear it.
Essentially,

93
00:04:52,301 --> 00:04:56,290
we are made to be manipulated and 
there's no shortage of that.

94
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:57,700
Of course,
in human history,

95
00:04:57,701 --> 00:04:58,534
probably in your personal history too,
but along with our intuitive desire to 

96
00:05:01,841 --> 00:05:02,674
get what we want,
we are also guided by the intuitive 

97
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,860
aversion to harm our reasoning.
Faculty is not a slave to our emotions,

98
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:09,813
but a politician and the best 
politicians like the best people can 

99
00:05:12,731 --> 00:05:15,850
navigate a fluid reality of flexible 
rules seeking,

100
00:05:15,851 --> 00:05:20,170
ever subtler ways not to harm the people
they share the world with.

101
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,530
And you know what harms people 
manipulation.

102
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,600
Hey everybody,
thanks for watching.

103
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:37,570
Don't forget to follow me on twitter and
tumbler links in the description.

104
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:38,404
Also,
if you want to read more about moral 

105
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:42,220
psychology,
I highly recommend the righteous mind by

106
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,740
Jonathan Haidt is,
it's a great book,

107
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,350
extremely well written,
uh,

108
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:49,240
and you'll learn a little bit more about
why we think the way we think.

109
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,273
Um,
so read that and I will see you next 

110
00:05:52,331 --> 00:05:53,164
time.
