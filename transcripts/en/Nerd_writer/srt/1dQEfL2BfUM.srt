1
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:09,850
One of my favorite comics,
masterpiece mouse,

2
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,940
comes in the very first chapter here.
The comic,

3
00:00:12,941 --> 00:00:13,774
if you don't know,
is about spiegelman's father's 

4
00:00:15,341 --> 00:00:18,010
experience in the Holocaust.
More specifically,

5
00:00:18,011 --> 00:00:21,820
it's about spiegelman's own efforts to 
come to grips with that experience while

6
00:00:21,821 --> 00:00:25,570
navigating a really strained 
relationship with his dad.

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,433
Mouse is obsessed with this 
correspondence between the past and the 

8
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:33,640
present and it's a theme that Spiegelman
is determined to workout visually in his

9
00:00:33,641 --> 00:00:35,380
comic.
How does he do that?

10
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:36,573
Well,
let's take a look at the page that I 

11
00:00:37,181 --> 00:00:38,014
mentioned earlier.
Panel by panel in the first 

12
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,713
spiegelman's.
Father Vladik takes his grown son 

13
00:00:42,371 --> 00:00:43,204
already backup to his old bedroom after 
dinner so that he can do some exercise 

14
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:49,390
already.
The past is signaled here with the empty

15
00:00:49,391 --> 00:00:50,224
bedroom.
Have a child that's moved out in the 

16
00:00:51,611 --> 00:00:52,444
second panel.
We get a closer look at that room and 

17
00:00:53,771 --> 00:00:56,680
what Vlad ics done with it.
More remnants of the past,

18
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:59,410
like the pennant banner from 
Spiegelman's College Harper,

19
00:00:59,411 --> 00:01:01,060
where he studied art and philosophy.

20
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:04,990
We get our first glimpse of the 
exercycle that Vladik uses to work out,

21
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,153
and this is where art broaches,
the subject of the book that we're 

22
00:01:08,711 --> 00:01:09,544
reading now,
notice that the body's of both father 

23
00:01:11,501 --> 00:01:12,334
and son are leaning at the same angle,
spiegelman's asking his dad to open up 

24
00:01:15,761 --> 00:01:16,594
so he parallels his body language.
He's also equating these two men 

25
00:01:19,931 --> 00:01:23,800
visually and the book will continue to 
compare and contrast them until the end.

26
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:24,933
In the third panel,
the heads are parallel this time arts 

27
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,113
looking at a picture,
but we won't learn what it is until a 

28
00:01:29,801 --> 00:01:32,890
few panels down and the fourth panel,
nothing changes,

29
00:01:32,891 --> 00:01:33,724
but art's head which swivels around to 
his father as he makes his request 

30
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:37,723
explicit,
and then we come to the fifth panel 

31
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:41,560
which stretches the entire width of the 
page.

32
00:01:41,561 --> 00:01:42,394
It has a lot going on right away.
You can see three key signifiers of the 

33
00:01:45,281 --> 00:01:46,450
past,
the picture,

34
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:47,343
the identification,
Tattoo Vladik received outfits and the 

35
00:01:50,201 --> 00:01:54,790
speech bubble where Vladik says it would
take many books my life and no one wants

36
00:01:54,791 --> 00:01:57,970
anyway to hear such stories as critic 
Hillary Chute notes.

37
00:01:58,030 --> 00:01:58,863
It's as if the past articulated,
inscribed in documented were flanking 

38
00:02:04,031 --> 00:02:08,320
both men closing in on them,
and of course within this rd is enclosed

39
00:02:08,321 --> 00:02:10,570
by his father.
In the six panel,

40
00:02:10,571 --> 00:02:13,840
we learned that the photograph is of 
already mother on Joe,

41
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,080
which helps us understand the panels 
that came before.

42
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,103
In the seventh panel,
we see Vladik shoe peddling with effort 

43
00:02:20,171 --> 00:02:22,150
on the bike,
but going nowhere.

44
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:25,270
Then in the eighth and final circular 
panel,

45
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,133
we get our first window into the past,
into the story within a story that will 

46
00:02:29,621 --> 00:02:31,930
consume the book.
The different shape signals,

47
00:02:31,931 --> 00:02:32,764
a new narrative thread.
While the image of latic echoes the 

48
00:02:35,441 --> 00:02:39,070
photograph that's been a dominant 
feature of the rest of the page

49
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,460
and a comic.
You have various panels.

50
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,970
Those panels are each units of time.
You see them simultaneously,

51
00:02:44,971 --> 00:02:49,380
so you have various moments in time 
simultaneously made present.

52
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:50,363
That's art spiegelman explaining why 
it's a bit unfair to do what I just did 

53
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,770
and considered the value of a panel on 
its own.

54
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:59,530
For spiegelman,
the basic unit of comics is the page,

55
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:00,543
its basic function,
that interplay of moments that happens 

56
00:03:02,621 --> 00:03:06,790
when you take in several panels all at 
once in a way that's unique to comics.

57
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:11,200
Time is made spatial spread out across a
surface so that you can see not only how

58
00:03:11,201 --> 00:03:13,870
the past affects the future,
but vice versa.

59
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,440
What you learn here,
that this picture is of art's Mom,

60
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:22,270
white ex wife who committed suicide,
transforms the meaning of this look here

61
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,373
and all it takes is a glance,
the slightest movement in the eyes to 

62
00:03:26,381 --> 00:03:30,250
access that connection.
You don't need to rewind or read back or

63
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:35,140
start over again on the page.
Those two moments exist simultaneously.

64
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,093
In this sense,
graphic design becomes a vital part of 

65
00:03:38,531 --> 00:03:39,340
comic making.

66
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:42,340
As the Great Cartoonist Seth Aka Gregory
Golan once said,

67
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,473
the words and pictures that make up the 
comics language are often described as 

68
00:03:46,571 --> 00:03:49,930
pros and illustration combined a bad 
metaphor.

69
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:52,510
Poetry and graphic design seems more 
apt.

70
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:53,643
Poetry for the rhythm and condensing 
graphic design because cartooning is 

71
00:03:57,401 --> 00:04:01,210
more about moving shapes around 
designing than it is about drawing.

72
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:02,163
This page of mouse is the perfect 
illustration of that sentiment and take 

73
00:04:05,171 --> 00:04:07,810
a closer look.
What do you see in this design?

74
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:11,920
What about now in Spiegelman's book and 
life?

75
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:15,280
His father is a towering figure,
is experience surviving.

76
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,353
The most horrifying event in history 
becomes the central fact and not just 

77
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:21,003
his life but in his sons and that's how 
the trauma of the Holocaust invaded the 

78
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:26,164
world and how the past invades the 
present in mouse Vladik literally 

79
00:04:30,281 --> 00:04:35,281
invades the page and pumping away on his
exercycle as shoot points out already.

80
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,740
His father is literally unable to move 
forward,

81
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:42,610
which is why it makes sense that the 
past begins in the wheel.

82
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:47,260
If that blank art spiegelman set out to 
create a comic that would be readable,

83
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:52,000
that's why he spent 13 years writing,
drawing and designing mouse.

84
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,490
Every page is a new pattern to pick 
apart.

85
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:58,930
A new configuration of moments passed 
and president words and images.

86
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:02,710
Father and son.
This attention to design is why mouse is

87
00:05:02,711 --> 00:05:05,830
often regarded as the best graphic novel
ever written.

88
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:06,903
It's not that the subject matter is 
inherently dramatic and effecting which 

89
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:11,344
it is.
It's that spiegelman wanted to tell a 

90
00:05:13,001 --> 00:05:13,834
story in a way that was unique to the 
comics medium though to extract the 

91
00:05:17,321 --> 00:05:22,030
truth of the Holocaust and I'll just 
family that only comics could tell.

92
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,540

Thanks guys.
I'll see you next time.

108
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:12,950
Okay,
real quick.

109
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:13,783
Here's another page I really love for 
the way that it plays with how a comics 

110
00:06:17,241 --> 00:06:18,074
page is normally read.
It's the point in the story when black 

111
00:06:20,211 --> 00:06:24,260
is first entering Auschwitz.
Now everyone who reads comics knows that

112
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:27,380
you're meant to go left to right,
then down,

113
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,700
then left,
right again,

114
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,653
but here spiegelman cleverly uses 
overlapping speech bubbles to pull you 

115
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:34,184
down the left side,
and at that point you have to read down 

116
00:06:36,861 --> 00:06:39,990
again and that becomes a descent into 
the beast.

117
00:06:39,991 --> 00:06:42,350
Small,
horrifying,

118
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:44,180
but beautiful.
Anyway,

119
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,263
see you guys.
