00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,760
We survived the blizzard coffee on a 
Tuesday and blog,

2
00:00:02,761 --> 00:00:03,594
49.

3
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:15,533
Life often perfectly manageable is 
sometimes subject to intense and 

4
00:00:19,471 --> 00:00:20,304
revealing human moments.
Moments when the inscrutable veil that 

5
00:00:22,831 --> 00:00:23,664
is the exterior of ourselves suddenly 
becomes transparent so that anyone in 

6
00:00:27,391 --> 00:00:30,960
the vicinity who can see us can also see
through us.

7
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:31,853
You know what I mean?
If you've ever been embarrassed or seen 

8
00:00:33,571 --> 00:00:35,400
someone embarrassed,
you know what I mean?

9
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:37,320
The machinations behind the eyes 
normally,

10
00:00:37,321 --> 00:00:38,154
so swift and indecipherable fall away 
and you are left with the person so 

11
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:42,263
utterly and pathetically readable.
We try our best to avoid moments like 

12
00:00:45,361 --> 00:00:47,430
this.
It's in our interest to be a mystery.

13
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,470
Most of the time in social 
relationships,

14
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:50,453
people value unpredictability,
so we're unpredictable and there is no 

15
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:57,600
nakedness more naked than the experience
of being figured out,

16
00:00:57,601 --> 00:00:58,434
but here at nerdwriter industries,
we love this kind of moment because it 

17
00:01:01,141 --> 00:01:04,200
tells us something about people,
about naked people,

18
00:01:04,201 --> 00:01:06,540
and we love people at their most naked.

19
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,120
No way that that came out wrong or did 
it.

20
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:14,280
I live in New York City and I ride the 
subway everyday.

21
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,143
The subway,
like a cafe is a place where people are 

22
00:01:17,131 --> 00:01:17,964
alone together.
Most people read books or listen to 

23
00:01:20,281 --> 00:01:22,110
music or just stare off into the middle 
distance.

24
00:01:22,111 --> 00:01:26,190
The subway is not a destination.
It's a place between destinations and we

25
00:01:26,191 --> 00:01:28,620
have no intention of making it a 
destination,

26
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:31,350
so we all agree not to speak to one 
another.

27
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,213
Now,
one thing about the New York subway is 

28
00:01:33,091 --> 00:01:35,550
that it does have panhandlers homeless 
people,

29
00:01:35,551 --> 00:01:36,384
people down on their luck asking for 
money and it's a pretty frequent 

30
00:01:38,941 --> 00:01:42,000
occurrence exacerbated I'd imagined by 
the state of the economy.

31
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:43,920
These people,
despite their misfortunes,

32
00:01:43,921 --> 00:01:44,754
wield and incredible power,
when they come onto the train and give 

33
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:48,750
their speech,
always practiced,

34
00:01:48,751 --> 00:01:49,584
always forceful.
They create one of these intense and 

35
00:01:51,931 --> 00:01:52,764
revealing human moments,
and a subway car of 50 opaque souls 

36
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:00,360
becomes as transparent as clean water as
the downtrodden person,

37
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,700
either with musical instruments,
a sad face child or an associate.

38
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,553
A dog comes down the subway car in hand.
They force each and every writer to 

39
00:02:08,341 --> 00:02:11,760
confront their desperation.
A couple give a few coins or a dollar.

40
00:02:11,761 --> 00:02:15,840
Some look up and shake their heads.
Most people just stare aggressively into

41
00:02:15,841 --> 00:02:16,674
their books or at their feet ignoring 
and refusing the shameless person's 

42
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:23,550
existence.
People on the subway don't want this.

43
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:24,443
That's obvious.
A beggar violates the agreed rules of 

44
00:02:26,191 --> 00:02:27,024
the situation not to interact with.
Fact is that this person who may need 

45
00:02:29,521 --> 00:02:33,600
food or money to house their children or
money to pay for power has presented the

46
00:02:33,601 --> 00:02:36,510
train car with an explicit moral 
problem.

47
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:40,200
Should you give them money or not try as
we might.

48
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:44,040
There is no way once posed not to answer
this question.

49
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:44,903
I guess that the writers intuitive 
dislike of being forced to do something 

50
00:02:47,611 --> 00:02:48,444
in a place where they expect to do 
nothing is what influences most of them 

51
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,730
not to give and make no mistake.

52
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:57,390
Most people don't.
This echoes the theme of my last Vlog.

53
00:02:57,391 --> 00:02:59,830
We use our reason to justify our 
feelings.

54
00:02:59,831 --> 00:03:01,660
If you're offended by this person to 
start,

55
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,740
then here are some reasons not to.
Maybe they won't use the money for food,

56
00:03:05,741 --> 00:03:06,970
but instead for drugs,
maybe.

57
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,400
Maybe I'm making the problem worse.
This is my money.

58
00:03:09,401 --> 00:03:11,200
I earned it.
I worked hard for it.

59
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,063
They have no right to that.
I don't have enough money myself to be 

60
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:14,890
giving it away to others.
You know,

61
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:18,490
I only have a $5 bill in my wallet.
If I had a dollar bill or some coins,

62
00:03:18,491 --> 00:03:20,260
you know I do it,
but you know five's too much.

63
00:03:20,261 --> 00:03:21,094
You know what?
This will only perpetuate their 

64
00:03:22,421 --> 00:03:23,680
homelessness.
I know about these things.

65
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:26,350
They need to get a job.
I can't give everyday how much,

66
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,620
how much they want for me.
I'm not going to solve their problems is

67
00:03:29,621 --> 00:03:30,700
useless to give it all.

68
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:33,520
If your inclination on the other hand is
to give,

69
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,473
then you have to ask,
should you give every time and how much 

70
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:39,910
and to whom and knowing that beggars are
going to be on the subway.

71
00:03:39,911 --> 00:03:41,830
Should you be sure to have money with 
you always.

72
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,290
When you leave the house,
should you beat yourself up?

73
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,330
When you forget,
is it enough to deal with poverty?

74
00:03:46,331 --> 00:03:49,360
Only when it crosses your path,
should you be allowed to feel good about

75
00:03:49,361 --> 00:03:50,194
yourself?
If you give only once and it's only a 

76
00:03:51,911 --> 00:03:52,744
die,
there are no easy answers to these 

77
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:56,140
questions,
nor is there an easy answer to the first

78
00:03:56,141 --> 00:03:58,630
question.
The one in the moment when they hold out

79
00:03:58,631 --> 00:03:59,464
their hand,
all I can say is trying not to make the 

80
00:04:02,081 --> 00:04:06,550
perfect the enemy of the good.
What I do know is that the no stops this

81
00:04:06,551 --> 00:04:07,384
line of questioning in its tracks.
While the yes opens up that vast moral 

82
00:04:11,141 --> 00:04:11,974
web in which we are forced to consider 
the needs and desires of others forced 

83
00:04:14,951 --> 00:04:15,784
to confront and workout are messy 
responsibility in relation to everyone 

84
00:04:19,451 --> 00:04:21,250
else.
Still the fact is,

85
00:04:21,251 --> 00:04:22,084
given the truth that almost everyone 
doesn't give that there are a good 

86
00:04:25,691 --> 00:04:30,691
number of people like me that decided 
that they should but don't.

87
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,560
I think this tension,
insights of valuable pain in our hearts,

88
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:43,710
but I have to wonder,
is it valuable enough?

89
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:07,823
Great.
