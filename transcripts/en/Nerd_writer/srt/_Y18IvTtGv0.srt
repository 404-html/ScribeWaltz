1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:04,260
Teams are amazing,
you know,

2
00:00:04,261 --> 00:00:05,320
after the,
um,

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:11,630
the clint would speech Eastwick became a
thing Hashtag [inaudible],

4
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:15,330
which just means it means that you are 
going to entirely.

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:20,560
It means you take a picture of yourself 
looking at a chair and there are,

6
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:25,350
there are,
there are no pictures of dogs online.

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,690
This was the day after.
I mean that's,

8
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:32,310
that's I think also venues have the half
life of like reddit is the place where a

9
00:00:32,311 --> 00:00:35,190
lot of that original,
which is interesting.

10
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,630
It's like the,
what's the deal?

11
00:00:36,631 --> 00:00:37,710
You vote,
you voted up.

12
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:41,300
It's just an up vote down vote system.
So anyone who has an account,

13
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:44,620
can you go cast a vote which is like a 
thumbs up or down,

14
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:45,653
which is,
and that's how they aggregate the 

15
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,620
reaction and whoever has whatever,
whatever,

16
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,400
no matter what has the most uploads,
it goes to the top of their list.

17
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:57,263
You think,
you think that's where a lot of the 

18
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:58,503
names,
especially because you look at all of 

19
00:01:01,021 --> 00:01:05,130
these content sites with a post or all 
of these websites,

20
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:08,240
buzzfeed or something less feed ton of 
them.

21
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:09,503
Also,
a lot of them youtube clips that can 

22
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:13,950
come that go viral first,
get their big first push on Reddit,

23
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,620
some Weirdo we'll post it to.
It's called subreddits.

24
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,150
More specified topics within reddit.
So there's like,

25
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,780
are you active?
Are you an active redditor?

26
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,333
I look at it every day.
I will contribute and I don't have an 

27
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:29,590
account.
Yeah.

28
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:30,840
Um,
I'd,

29
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,790
I'd just like to observe.
I look at Buzzfeed,

30
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,780
do buzzfeed.
I do sometimes when I'm feeling not good

31
00:01:36,781 --> 00:01:39,100
as particularly shitty about myself.
There's interesting because it's,

32
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:44,120
it's the most successful rags slash 
highly opinionated.

33
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:47,430
It is arrived.
It's total rag,

34
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,720
but at the same time they have 
interesting things to say.

35
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,210
Sometimes there's this spoiler or 
they'll,

36
00:01:53,211 --> 00:01:57,120
they'll promote interesting conversation
sometimes like half of it is,

37
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,340
you know,
who just had tweeted like newt,

38
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,000
like nudes of themselves,
Dick Pics.

39
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:08,430
And the other side is a civil rights.
Like no,

40
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:12,960
like being in informing important 
political things.

41
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,160
This is why I hate,
by the way,

42
00:02:14,161 --> 00:02:14,994
this is why I hate getting coffee into 
the saucer because every time you lift 

43
00:02:18,421 --> 00:02:20,700
it up,
it drips onto the paper.

44
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:25,730
Do this.
Let's see that,

45
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,580
that,
that,

46
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:30,380
that made it 100 percent,
you know,

47
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,650
drip,
drip.

48
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:33,630
But now,
now I know that ended that saucer,

49
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,700
this with coffee everywhere.
