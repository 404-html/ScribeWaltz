1
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:05,353
Detective fiction always turns on it's 
revelations on those moments when 

2
00:00:09,681 --> 00:00:14,210
information suddenly transforms into 
cause and effect,

3
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:16,910
no one is better at achieving those 
revelations.

4
00:00:16,911 --> 00:00:17,744
Then private detective Sherlock Holmes,
and these days no one is better at 

5
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:24,380
visualizing them.
Then the creators of Sherlock,

6
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:29,620
the intoxicatingly inventive TV show 
that uses and imagines film editing as a

7
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:33,270
function of its main character's mind.

8
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,800
You said your life turned on one word.

9
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:39,320
Yes.
The name of the person the father wanted

10
00:00:39,321 --> 00:00:39,930
to kill.

11
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:40,763
Today I want to look at how sherlock 
gets from point a to point b from 

12
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,710
problem to solution,
mystery to clarity,

13
00:00:46,711 --> 00:00:50,580
and one of the shows most extraordinary 
visual revelations.

14
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,510
It's a sequence that lasts three minutes
and 42 seconds with a fresh,

15
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:59,100
weird idea and almost every beat.
It's a complete joy to watch unfold.

16
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:01,660
You said your life turned on one word.

17
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,100
Yes.
The name of the person the father wanted

18
00:01:05,101 --> 00:01:05,700
to kill

19
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,533
the background is this,
the daughter of famous multimillionaire 

20
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:09,624
Culverton Smith knows her father wants 
to kill someone but doesn't know who it 

21
00:01:13,861 --> 00:01:14,694
is.
I need to kill someone and she was told 

22
00:01:16,501 --> 00:01:17,334
the name once,
but under the influence of a drug that 

23
00:01:19,111 --> 00:01:22,300
wiped her memory.
All she knows is that it's one word

24
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,730
that's the impossible thing.
Just that right there.

25
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,990
Some possible names are one word that 
always at least two.

26
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:28,913
The added element here at one that's 
going to spin this revelation into a 

27
00:01:31,381 --> 00:01:35,460
whole nother gear is that Sherlock 
Holmes is on drugs.

28
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:36,563
He's been shooting cocaine,
a reference to the original Conan doyle 

29
00:01:39,061 --> 00:01:39,894
stories,
and it's accelerating and twisting his 

30
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:42,780
mind.
In fact,

31
00:01:42,781 --> 00:01:43,614
it's a pain of withdrawal from these 
drugs that puts the entire sequence in 

32
00:01:47,431 --> 00:01:48,264
motion.

33
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:51,140
You know what?
I expect it.

34
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,910
What am I nicer

35
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,553
in a mystery,
a revelation on the part of the 

36
00:02:14,361 --> 00:02:15,194
detective or the audience only works 
when it arises from information already 

37
00:02:18,591 --> 00:02:21,590
known.
What's new is the perspective,

38
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:22,783
and that change in perspective is 
triggered usually by something that 

39
00:02:25,281 --> 00:02:26,114
doesn't mean to.
I mean this kind of revelation is a 

40
00:02:28,191 --> 00:02:29,024
cliche by now,
but what sherlock does differently is 

41
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:35,420
stage those perspective shifts in its 
camera work and editing.

42
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:36,643
In that first subsequence,
we see sherlock from every possible 

43
00:02:39,711 --> 00:02:40,544
angle,
even from one that's impossible thanks 

44
00:02:42,651 --> 00:02:43,484
to his drug induced state,
punctuated by subliminal negative shots 

45
00:02:46,911 --> 00:02:51,020
of the confession paper that faith was 
holding and a compliment.

46
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:54,700
You know what?
I expect it nicer.

47
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,310
Anyone.

48
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:06,340
It's not just that sherlock 
recontextualizes old information.

49
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:07,203
The filmmakers take great pains to 
choreograph a relationship between old 

50
00:03:10,931 --> 00:03:13,540
and new perspectives that is 
conversational,

51
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:16,510
like the present and the past are 
speaking to each other.

52
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:17,920
In this part.
For example,

53
00:03:17,921 --> 00:03:20,800
sherlock stalks the location of an old 
episode,

54
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:23,800
the previous one,
but now everything is changed.

55
00:03:23,801 --> 00:03:25,990
Instead of seeing the street from a 
different angle,

56
00:03:25,991 --> 00:03:28,300
we see it from a totally different 
camera lens.

57
00:03:28,301 --> 00:03:29,134
Adding to that sense of attenuated 
drugged up disorientation and hear the 

58
00:03:33,251 --> 00:03:35,470
conversation with the past is even more 
literal.

59
00:03:35,471 --> 00:03:36,304
It's a present shot.
Past reverse shot is only one way that 

60
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:41,123
I've been sold.
If you've already moved the camera and 

61
00:03:42,641 --> 00:03:43,474
you've already changed the Lens,
why not transplant an entire set from 

62
00:03:47,531 --> 00:03:49,610
earlier in the episode?
I need to kill something.

63
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,440
Hey,

64
00:03:56,030 --> 00:04:00,770
anyone?
Anyone?

65
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,263
Anyone else?

66
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,790
Anyone?
Anyone?

67
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:06,123
Anyone?
Anyone.

68
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:09,403
Even more impressive than how Sherlock 
arrives at his revelation is how the 

69
00:04:12,891 --> 00:04:14,900
hero untangles,
what that means,

70
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:17,750
and what can only be called a leapfrog 
scene.

71
00:04:17,751 --> 00:04:20,210
Transition.
Maybe my favorite of all time.

72
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:23,810
Sherlock awakes from his reverie.
It goes like this.

73
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:27,590
Sherlock realizes where he is in the 
middle of a busy street,

74
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:30,080
a man yells at him,
reverse shot,

75
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:31,850
sherlock,
reverse shot.

76
00:04:31,851 --> 00:04:36,680
That man is now his drug dealing friend 
on the street reverse shot,

77
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,240
sherlock,
reverse shot.

78
00:04:38,241 --> 00:04:42,020
His drug dealing friend is actually 
speaking to him from Baker Street.

79
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,213
Reverse shot sherlock still outside,
reverse shot drug dealer telling him 

80
00:04:46,881 --> 00:04:50,390
that he's actually at Baker street to 
reverse shot.

81
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:53,900
Cue the best location,
transition effort.

82
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:02,350
Now let's watch that in real time.
What are you doing?

83
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:12,700
What were you doing in the middle of a 
bloody street?

84
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:16,400
Baker Street.
So will you.

85
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:20,040
It's

86
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,873
hard to imagine a scenario where more 
could be accomplished with 10 shots and 

87
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:28,590
sherlock's mind catches up with itself 
and he grapples with the thought of just

88
00:05:28,591 --> 00:05:29,424
how many serial killers might be hiding 
behind wealth and fame like Culverton 

89
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,530
Smith,
the revelation,

90
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,560
the drugs and the sequence reach their 
crescendo with the set itself turning on

91
00:05:40,261 --> 00:05:41,094
its axis.
It's important I think to remember that 

92
00:05:42,901 --> 00:05:43,734
what we've seen here has taken place in 
the span of only three minutes and 42 

93
00:05:48,421 --> 00:05:49,254
seconds.
I mean there are full movies with fewer 

94
00:05:51,811 --> 00:05:55,140
original ideas.
There is no CGI in the sequence,

95
00:05:55,141 --> 00:05:58,430
no digital fireworks.
This is just filmmaking,

96
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,293
just the laws of editing embodied 
brilliantly as the workings of an 

97
00:06:03,741 --> 00:06:04,760
extraordinary mind.

98
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:14,363
So the nerdwriter crossed a million 
subscribers last week and that is the 

99
00:06:18,091 --> 00:06:20,910
biggest professional milestone in my 
life.

100
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:21,803
In 2017,
I want to make a show that lives up to 

101
00:06:24,091 --> 00:06:25,710
the amount of people who are watching 
it.

102
00:06:25,711 --> 00:06:27,630
I hope.
When you tell people about the show,

103
00:06:27,631 --> 00:06:32,460
you say it something that you've never 
seen on youtube or TV or anywhere.

104
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,473
That's the vision I have in my head and 
that's what I'm always thinking about 

105
00:06:35,941 --> 00:06:38,610
when I'm making new episodes,
so thank you for watching.

106
00:06:38,611 --> 00:06:41,430
