1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:04,590
Coffee on a Tuesday block 13.
Oh,

2
00:00:04,591 --> 00:00:04,990
hey,
listen,

3
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:05,823
spider.
You're trying to scare me because it's 

4
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,630
13 flood.

5
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:13,160
Yeah.

6
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:22,980
Yeah,
that's right.

7
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:25,500
I said it.
Raising awareness is for pussies.

8
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:28,440
What we explained,
you can see very clearly on this diagram

9
00:00:28,441 --> 00:00:29,274
that I just made,
that there are three different types of 

10
00:00:31,471 --> 00:00:32,940
rates.
You can raise awareness,

11
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,080
you can raise understanding,
or you can raise money.

12
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:36,933
Of those three,
clearly one stands out as being for 

13
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:40,623
postings,
so all you fund hipsters out there who 

14
00:00:42,151 --> 00:00:47,010
grew your mustache for movember to raise
some awareness for prostate cancer.

15
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,220
I say yes,
it is better than doing nothing,

16
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,570
but you are nonetheless still pussies

17
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:55,923
to prove it to you.
I'm here at the Comerica Bank Tower in 

18
00:00:57,701 --> 00:00:58,534
downtown Los Angeles and I'm about to 
walk up 50 flights of steps to raise 

19
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:07,920
awareness for cystic fibrosis.
Look at all these pussies.

20
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:10,083
I'm going to do one better.
Not only am I going to climb 50 flights 

21
00:01:12,281 --> 00:01:16,120
of stairs when I'm going to raise some 
understanding in the process,

22
00:01:16,121 --> 00:01:16,954
so every 10 flights,
I'm going to explain a little bit more 

23
00:01:19,271 --> 00:01:20,920
to you about what?
Cystic.

24
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:24,030
Okay,
here we go.

25
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,293
Yeah,

26
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,840
you have a team that makes it

27
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:58,813
10 existing fibrosis is an inherited 
disease that affects the lungs and the 

28
00:02:08,551 --> 00:02:09,384
digestive system and affected gene and 
its protein product cause the body to 

29
00:02:13,111 --> 00:02:13,944
produce unusually thick and sticky 
mucous that clogs the lungs that leads 

30
00:02:17,251 --> 00:02:18,084
to life threatening lung infections and 
obstructs the pancreas which makes 

31
00:02:20,371 --> 00:02:24,420
enzymes that help the body break down 
food and absorb nutrients.

32
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,950
Currently about 70,000
people in the world happened.

33
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,410
That's about 100,000,
so maybe you know someone who hasn't.

34
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:33,000
Maybe you don't.
I do these 22 years,

35
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:36,690
the median life expectancy of a sufferer
of cystic fibrosis days late 30,

36
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:41,790
50 years ago.
It was about six months necessarily 20,

37
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,900
already filled the muscle on the muscle,
burn up,

38
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:47,893
power it suffers of cystic fibrosis,
have a mutation on their seventh 

39
00:02:51,391 --> 00:02:52,224
chromosome on a gene called the cystic 
fibrosis transmembrane conductance 

40
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:56,993
regulator for cf ball,
cftr closest thick respiratory 

41
00:03:00,551 --> 00:03:01,384
secretions that are hard to clear from 
the sewing bacteria become more easily 

42
00:03:04,891 --> 00:03:07,800
tracked and causing infection and 
inflammation in the.

43
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,610
Also in the pancreas organ that helps 
you break down all the fat,

44
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,810
protein,
carbs,

45
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:13,733
and fat.
You will find the disease blocks these 

46
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:15,983
enzymes that prohibits digestion.
This means that necessarily fat soluble 

47
00:03:19,681 --> 00:03:20,514
score,
vitamins don't get absorbed into the 

48
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,880
bloodstream.
Okay.

49
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:25,823
10 flights.

50
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:33,850
Honestly,
this is easy.

51
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:39,450
Thank you so much.
So the medicine,

52
00:03:40,801 --> 00:03:44,160
we follow the same enzymes,
vitamins,

53
00:03:44,161 --> 00:03:48,510
antibiotics to stop infection,
mucus thinner as an bronco.

54
00:03:48,511 --> 00:03:52,200
Dilators to facilitate read,
suffers from cystic fibrosis,

55
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,470
digests less.
They have to eat more,

56
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,900
more calories and more fat all while 
maintaining a healthy weight.

57
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:01,200
Because a healthy body makes for a 
strong immune system.

58
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:02,880
And in this case it has to work 
overtime.

59
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:06,360
Exercise like this is a must,
so let's

60
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,353
good.

61
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:17,943
Okay,
so how is their life different from 

62
00:04:20,941 --> 00:04:21,774
ours?
They have to take different medicines 

63
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:23,543
all day long.
They have to use a nebulizer to inhale 

64
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:27,600
special ms medicines directly into their
lungs.

65
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:28,434
They have to watch their sugar because 
diabetes is especially prevalent among 

66
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:33,240
the cystic fibrosis community.
They're in and out of the hospital.

67
00:04:33,241 --> 00:04:34,074
They can't smoke cigarettes or marijuana
because they're especially susceptible 

68
00:04:36,751 --> 00:04:39,540
to fungal and bacteria.
They can drink alcohol,

69
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:40,374
but only in moderation though that might
be said for everyone should have 

70
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,260
scratched,
scratched,

71
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:47,883
shouldn't stress

72
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:56,150
like a before.
Thank you.

73
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,183
He's let it be known that Justin Syriana
the camera and also made it up 50 

74
00:05:16,971 --> 00:05:18,350
flights with me.
Thank you very much,

75
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:20,780
Jay.
That's not a trick.

76
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,713
Now.
That'd be really ready to take it away 

77
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:26,920
at home.
Thanks Evan.

78
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:30,210
So do you remember the cft?
Rg?

79
00:05:30,211 --> 00:05:31,044
Well,
here's what's happening on a molecular 

80
00:05:32,841 --> 00:05:33,674
level.
A gene is like a little instruction 

81
00:05:34,881 --> 00:05:35,714
manual.
It tells amino acids how to shape 

82
00:05:37,401 --> 00:05:41,390
themselves into proteins.
Proteins are these wildly complex shapes

83
00:05:41,391 --> 00:05:44,600
like bunches of ribbon that perform 
various functions in the bottle.

84
00:05:44,601 --> 00:05:48,320
The shape is everything.
It's a name and a job all in one.

85
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,620
It tells everything around what it's 
there to do.

86
00:05:51,621 --> 00:05:52,454
The cftr protein coming from the CFTR 
gene sits on the membrane of cells and 

87
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,290
the coming and going of sodium chloride 
or salt.

88
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:01,250
Okay,
good.

89
00:06:01,251 --> 00:06:02,084
So far,
the mutation associated with cystic 

90
00:06:03,141 --> 00:06:03,974
fibrosis is a faulty instruction.
The protein is constructed wrong and 

91
00:06:07,911 --> 00:06:10,220
instead of facilitating the passions of 
salt,

92
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,073
it blocks it.
And this is what creates the mucus 

93
00:06:12,621 --> 00:06:13,454
buildup and all the other troubles.
Now there's a drug in development by 

94
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:19,160
vertex pharmaceuticals called VX seven,
seven.

95
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:23,830
It's a CFTR potentiator and it aims to 
increase the function of those effective

96
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,673
cftr genes by increasing the gating 
activity or the ability for ions to be 

97
00:06:29,121 --> 00:06:29,954
transported across the cell membrane.
It's currently in phase three of FDA 

98
00:06:33,051 --> 00:06:33,884
trials and it has had promising results 
so far along partly due to the 

99
00:06:36,801 --> 00:06:40,550
fundraising done by the cystic fibrosis 
foundation or the CFF.

100
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,833
And we can only hope for the best.
This is why raising understanding is 

101
00:06:44,511 --> 00:06:45,344
better than raising awareness because 
you know where your money is going if 

102
00:06:47,751 --> 00:06:48,584
you donate to this cause,
you're donating to the research and 

103
00:06:49,941 --> 00:06:50,774
development of gene therapy treatments 
that will attack this disease at its 

104
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:57,530
root and potentially cure those affected
with cystic fibrosis forever.

105
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:01,640
We all get just one life and then we die
and that's the end.

106
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:06,700
All we can hope for is to get 60 or 80 
or 100 years of it to do what we love,

107
00:07:07,131 --> 00:07:09,110
to spend it with family and friends to 
create,

108
00:07:09,111 --> 00:07:09,944
to learn to do whatever we feel is 
donate and give those with cystic 

109
00:07:13,191 --> 00:07:14,024
fibrosis the chance of 100 years.
It's why raising money is better than 

110
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:20,540
raising understand and it's what they 
all did

111
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,860
and it's what he did,
which I guess makes me the pussy.

112
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:31,773
No,
you could find information about where 

113
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,200
to donate the dude

114
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,930
blog 13.
