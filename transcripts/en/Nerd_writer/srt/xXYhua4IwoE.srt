1
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:18,510
History,
emotional anxiety,

2
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:21,083
anxiety about emotions and thinkers from
the classical period to the modern have 

3
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:31,040
pitted emotion against reason as 
opposing forces vying for the minds,

4
00:00:31,321 --> 00:00:34,560
control and emotional person was seen as
weak,

5
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:35,423
giving into the path of least resistance
to base desires ruled by capricious 

6
00:00:40,231 --> 00:00:42,990
feelings.
Q is the path to the dark side.

7
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:47,280
Strong on the other hand,
would rule their emotions with reason.

8
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:51,060
Everyone feels pressure.
Winners don't let it show.

9
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:51,923
Disney personified this struggle in a 
short eight minute cartoon from 1943 

10
00:00:55,561 --> 00:00:59,130
called aptly reason and emotion within 
each of us.

11
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:00,003
These two wages ceaseless back from 
mastering the short is a lightly 

12
00:01:02,911 --> 00:01:03,744
disguised propaganda piece,
heartening Americans against fear 

13
00:01:05,911 --> 00:01:08,940
tactics used by the axis powers in World
War II,

14
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:12,420
but it was nonetheless a point of 
reference for the Pixar team,

15
00:01:12,421 --> 00:01:16,590
led by director Pete doctor responsible 
for the film inside out.

16
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:17,583
Doctors.
Film is a far more nuanced take on the 

17
00:01:19,831 --> 00:01:20,664
inner workings of the mind,
appropriate for a post 40 and post 

18
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:24,834
cultural revolution age when we're 
encouraged extensively at least to 

19
00:01:27,871 --> 00:01:31,090
embrace emotions rather than urged to 
masterman.

20
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,210
The film tells the story of the 11 year 
old Riley as she navigates a move across

21
00:01:36,211 --> 00:01:39,390
the country and more centrally,
how five emotions,

22
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,460
joy,
the leader sadness,

23
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,660
fear,
disgust,

24
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,553
and anger balanced the control of her 
mind from a mission control like 

25
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,263
headquarters in this model,
each day consists of discrete moments 

26
00:01:51,451 --> 00:01:52,284
colored by one of the five emotions 
which are sent during sleep to a vast 

27
00:01:56,131 --> 00:01:56,964
archive of longterm memories,
very rarely inexperienced is so 

28
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:01,374
formative that it creates a core memory 
which goes on to form the basis of 

29
00:02:05,221 --> 00:02:10,050
Riley's personality,
imagined as themed Park Islands when joy

30
00:02:10,051 --> 00:02:13,050
and sadness are accidentally injected 
from headquarters.

31
00:02:13,051 --> 00:02:13,884
The film chronicles their Cathartic 
journey through several other mental 

32
00:02:16,561 --> 00:02:18,750
regions,
including imagination land,

33
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,733
a dream production company that looks 
like the paramount lot abstract thought 

34
00:02:23,281 --> 00:02:24,114
and a subconscious jail.
The Catharsis comes when joy realizes 

35
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:30,810
that sadness is not only useful but 
essential,

36
00:02:30,811 --> 00:02:34,650
perhaps even more essential than she is 
to Riley's harmonious,

37
00:02:34,651 --> 00:02:37,020
mental functioning and overall 
happiness.

38
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,680
The film itself and its message to 
embrace sadness,

39
00:02:40,681 --> 00:02:41,514
to feel what needs feeling is surely a 
token of progress against our long 

40
00:02:45,771 --> 00:02:46,604
standing emotional anxiety,
but is this model of the mind and its 

41
00:02:50,321 --> 00:02:53,640
emotions and accurate one inside out 
basis.

42
00:02:53,641 --> 00:02:54,474
It's theory of emotions in large part on
the work of Paul Ekman and influential 

43
00:02:58,321 --> 00:02:59,154
scientists in the psychology of emotion,
Ekman posits that there are seven basic 

44
00:03:03,431 --> 00:03:04,264
emotions with universal facial signals.
The ones featured in the film plus two 

45
00:03:08,441 --> 00:03:10,720
that were cut,
surprise and content.

46
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:15,100
These basic emotions are ubiquitous.
The world over Eckman says,

47
00:03:15,101 --> 00:03:15,934
and can be read on the faces of anyone,
whether that's by an astute listener or 

48
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:20,913
facial recognition.
Software like those Ekman has helped 

49
00:03:22,991 --> 00:03:26,260
develop controversially for security and
marketing uses.

50
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:27,653
Ekman and other consultants on the film 
have praised inside out for providing a 

51
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:35,770
model for kids that is engaging as well 
as scientifically sound,

52
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:36,963
but the edmunds model may be the 
dominant one in the psychology of 

53
00:03:39,971 --> 00:03:40,540
emotion.

54
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,373
Right now,
it's by no means the only indeed the 

55
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:44,524
field is a far more fractious one than 
the film scientific consultants lead on 

56
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,073
inside out seems to suggest that a 
child's experiences will be defined by 

57
00:03:53,141 --> 00:03:53,974
whichever emotion is at the health.
What's more that overall personality 

58
00:03:58,031 --> 00:04:01,960
determined by colored core memories has 
an emotional driver.

59
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:06,880
This model stands opposite to the key 
insights of psychoanalysis,

60
00:04:06,881 --> 00:04:07,714
for example,
which hold that emotions can be 

61
00:04:09,461 --> 00:04:10,294
transferred,
transformed or distorted expressions of 

62
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:16,420
unconscious ideas and repressed 
experiences.

63
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,433
In other words,
feelings of sadness or joy or fear are 

64
00:04:20,711 --> 00:04:23,770
frequently far removed from their 
causes.

65
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:28,420
Understanding them as specific entities 
is troublesome because they're often not

66
00:04:28,421 --> 00:04:29,254
what they seem to be,
which is to say that understanding of 

67
00:04:30,991 --> 00:04:31,824
motion as the driver and not the 
expression of ideas and experience may 

68
00:04:35,321 --> 00:04:37,680
ignore underlying causes.
Indeed,

69
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:38,523
the idea that emotions or memories can 
be separate or discrete in any way is a 

70
00:04:42,221 --> 00:04:43,054
dubious one.

71
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,013
The film itself begins to challenge this
at the end when the control panel in 

72
00:04:46,691 --> 00:04:47,524
headquarters is expanded to fit all the 
emotions and when the memory orb start 

73
00:04:51,101 --> 00:04:51,934
to reflect mixed experience,
but a sense that experience can be 

74
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:59,320
quantified,
pervades the film and like anything that

75
00:04:59,321 --> 00:05:00,154
may reflect more about our culture at 
the moment than the science itself for 

76
00:05:03,801 --> 00:05:07,100
joy and sadness.
The scariest place in the film isn't the

77
00:05:07,101 --> 00:05:10,130
subconscious prison that houses Riley's 
worst fears,

78
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:11,293
but a giant pit in the center of Riley's
mine where memories are forgotten 

79
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:15,943
forever without any hope of recall in an
increasingly data driven culture where 

80
00:05:20,811 --> 00:05:21,644
more data equals more truth.
The greatest anxiety of all is the loss 

81
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,480
of information and the headquarters of 
Riley's.

82
00:05:29,481 --> 00:05:30,314
Mine does feel a bit managerial with its
control panel and user manuals and 

83
00:05:34,521 --> 00:05:35,354
Riley,
a bit like an automaton controlled by a 

84
00:05:37,251 --> 00:05:39,830
highly sophisticated technocratic 
operation.

85
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:40,693
The decision making process is a bit 
wonky to since the latest neuroscience 

86
00:05:43,731 --> 00:05:48,620
tells us that the frontal lobe and Max 
kind of executive function that mediates

87
00:05:48,621 --> 00:05:49,454
between the emotions and the limbic 
system and higher cognitive functions 

88
00:05:52,591 --> 00:05:57,060
like reflection and critical thinking.
Obviously not always in favor of the.

89
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,070
Maybe

90
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,620
at this point you're saying the same 
thing as the voice.

91
00:06:00,621 --> 00:06:02,960
In my own head,
it's a kid's movie.

92
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,350
It's a comedy and that's very true,
and the director,

93
00:06:06,351 --> 00:06:08,230
Pete doctor,
has never held this film up

94
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:09,163
as an academic or therapeutic tool.
He admits the need for poetic and 

95
00:06:12,501 --> 00:06:13,334
comedic license to adding an executive 
function like the kind of just 

96
00:06:16,101 --> 00:06:16,940
mentioned,
for example,

97
00:06:16,941 --> 00:06:19,340
would no doubt make the film too 
complex,

98
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:20,383
as with any number of other things like 
the two basic emotions he left out or 

99
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:27,320
any other emotion,
I don't think his dramatic instincts can

100
00:06:27,321 --> 00:06:28,154
be questioned here under the premises of
the emotional model that inside out 

101
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:34,670
presents the narrative unfolds with 
grace,

102
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:37,130
subtle,
deep and intense poignancy.

103
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,650
I'll leave the formal critique to 
someone else,

104
00:06:39,651 --> 00:06:43,360
but there's no doubt that this is 
masterful filmmaking.

105
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:44,623
I had the tiers to prove it,
but it does raise questions about the 

106
00:06:47,751 --> 00:06:48,584
effect of popular models of the mind.
Pixar tell stories so mythic and 

107
00:06:52,941 --> 00:06:53,774
archetipal and so well that it's all but
impossible not to internalize some of 

108
00:06:58,461 --> 00:07:00,710
their elements,
especially for kids.

109
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:05,120
If the result is that children learn 
earlier and better why it's important to

110
00:07:05,121 --> 00:07:05,954
accept and expect sadness,
then I think it's unquestionably a good 

111
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:14,510
thing,
but sadness and joy and fear and disgust

112
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:19,540
and anger are not discrete things or 
self contained or even fully internal.

113
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:25,190
Neither are personality traits or for 
that matter personalities,

114
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:30,620
any model of emotion is going to reflect
a split between biology and culture,

115
00:07:30,621 --> 00:07:34,340
between neuroscience and theoretical 
psychoanalysis.

116
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,513
Don't let anyone tell you that that 
debate has been decided one way or the 

117
00:07:38,031 --> 00:07:38,864
other.
There are as many emotional theories as 

118
00:07:40,701 --> 00:07:41,534
there are emotional psychologists.
What's interesting and ironic about 

119
00:07:45,591 --> 00:07:48,800
inside out is that Riley may come off as
a bit robotic,

120
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,083
but a more complex and complete 
framework for the inner workings of the 

121
00:07:53,301 --> 00:07:56,510
mind can be found.
Enjoy herself.

122
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,373
A character who questions and reflects 
who turns inward not to another smaller 

123
00:08:02,451 --> 00:08:03,284
headquarters,
but a cauldron of indistinct compounds 

124
00:08:06,141 --> 00:08:06,974
of feeling influenced by chemistry 
situation and other people inside out 

125
00:08:12,171 --> 00:08:13,004
may not be perfectly accurate,
but the film inspires something more 

126
00:08:17,031 --> 00:08:17,864
important than that.
Something that doesn't require 

127
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:25,120
scientific exactness,
emotional intelligence.

128
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:33,500
It is a sunny day outside right now.
Hey everybody,

129
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,310
thanks for watching.
I'm,

130
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,353
I love Pixar generally,
but I love this movie just because it 

131
00:08:38,271 --> 00:08:39,104
gives you so much to dig into an 
explorer and I had a lot of fun making 

132
00:08:41,511 --> 00:08:42,970
this and putting this together.
Um,

133
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:43,903
if you think that the nerd writer and 
what I'm doing here is something that 

134
00:08:46,911 --> 00:08:47,744
you're not seeing elsewhere on youtube,
you can pledge little to my channel by 

135
00:08:51,021 --> 00:08:51,854
clicking here and going to my patriots 
what funds this project and helps me 

136
00:08:56,521 --> 00:08:58,890
improve the quality.
There's so much more I want to do.

137
00:08:58,891 --> 00:09:00,810
There's more series that I'm going to be
introducing soon.

138
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,380
And the funding is what makes it 
possible.

139
00:09:04,381 --> 00:09:05,214
I mean that.
That's the unique relationship between 

140
00:09:06,211 --> 00:09:07,044
you and me.
There's nothing in between us and what 

141
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:09,414
you give me.
The money you give me helps me to make 

142
00:09:11,191 --> 00:09:15,960
this project better and more in depth.
And I hope that you trust that I will do

143
00:09:15,961 --> 00:09:16,794
that by,
by the quality of the content that I've 

144
00:09:18,631 --> 00:09:19,464
made so far.
So thank you so much again for watching 

145
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,380
and I'll see you guys next Wednesday.
