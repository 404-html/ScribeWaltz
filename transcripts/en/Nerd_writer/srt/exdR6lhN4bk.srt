1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:04,140
Let's just be honest with ourselves for 
a minute.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,800
Economics is a mind boggling discipline 
for economists that's bad,

3
00:00:10,231 --> 00:00:11,064
but also sort of good news because you 
can make almost any argument stick if 

4
00:00:14,971 --> 00:00:17,460
you just troll around in the data for 
long enough,

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,230
but to the average person,
the layman,

6
00:00:19,231 --> 00:00:20,064
it's a little bit different.
The global economy must feel like a 

7
00:00:22,681 --> 00:00:23,514
giant,
hulking mass that grinds against the 

8
00:00:25,381 --> 00:00:30,000
world unstoppable and on answerable to 
the small problems of individuals.

9
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,380
So when your boss asks you to work 
overtime but won't pay you for it,

10
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,633
you don't argue or demand to be paid 
because how could an ant influence a 

11
00:00:38,881 --> 00:00:39,714
conversation between people or when you 
ask for a raise and the boss threatens 

12
00:00:43,411 --> 00:00:44,244
to fire you,
you don't stick up for yourself because 

13
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:47,173
no raise is better than no job.
Threats like these don't just function 

14
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,430
on the level of individuals in many 
ways.

15
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:57,750
It's how the entire American economy has
operated for almost 40 years.

16
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:58,823
That's how you end up with a graph like 
this which shows the wealthiest sliver 

17
00:01:02,491 --> 00:01:06,060
of society getting virtually all the 
gains from economic growth,

18
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:08,820
siphoning money from the middle class 
and the poor.

19
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:13,470
Take a step back from this in a 
democratic system which extends the vote

20
00:01:13,471 --> 00:01:14,304
to all citizens over 18.
It's hard to imagine how such a small 

21
00:01:18,001 --> 00:01:18,834
percentage of people could convince the 
rest to perpetuate a system that does 

22
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,233
this.
The truth is there's only one way to do 

23
00:01:27,241 --> 00:01:28,074
this.
You have to create an economic theory 

24
00:01:30,121 --> 00:01:30,954
that makes the exploitation of the 
people look like the solution to their 

25
00:01:34,621 --> 00:01:36,390
problems.
In other words,

26
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,350
you have to tell a story.
That's all the economy is.

27
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,213
It's a story that we tell ourselves,
a story that tells us what decisions to 

28
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:46,380
make about our own resources.

29
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:49,980
So what if your story is that lowering 
taxes on the rich,

30
00:01:49,981 --> 00:01:54,930
especially on unearned income,
deregulating finance and privatizing the

31
00:01:54,931 --> 00:01:59,910
public comments is like taking the 
living economy out of the shade and into

32
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:04,230
the sun where it can flourish.
It's a pretty good story and in fact,

33
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,333
those are the basics of a story that 
have animated our politics and our 

34
00:02:08,401 --> 00:02:09,234
economy since Ronald Reagan,
a story that has produced advocates and 

35
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,990
presidents on both sides of the 
political spectrum.

36
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,730
This story didn't help the middle class 
or the poor,

37
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,960
not really.
Their wages haven't risen since we began

38
00:02:21,961 --> 00:02:22,794
telling it,
but it did give the top one percent 

39
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:30,930
greater access to and greater power over
all the best storytellers,

40
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,240
politicians,
academics,

41
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,700
and the media.
To change the economy,

42
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:38,910
you have to change the story.
A difficult thing to do,

43
00:02:38,911 --> 00:02:42,810
considering how much power has 
consolidated in the hands of so few,

44
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,220
but it's not impossible.

45
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:46,560
Take the minimum wage.
For example,

46
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:50,490
right now the federal minimum wage $7 
and twenty five cents an hour.

47
00:02:50,491 --> 00:02:52,950
That's about $15,000
a year.

48
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,820
In 1968,
the minimum wage was a dollar 60,

49
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:57,683
but when you adjust for inflation,
that number it all the way up to $8 and 

50
00:03:00,671 --> 00:03:04,960
fifty four cents an hour,
a dollar and twenty nine cents more than

51
00:03:04,961 --> 00:03:06,850
it is today.
Meanwhile,

52
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:07,723
American worker productivity has never 
stopped growing so much so that if the 

53
00:03:10,901 --> 00:03:13,030
minimum wage kept pace with 
productivity,

54
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:18,300
it would have been $21 an hour by now,
so in the absence of federal action,

55
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:21,340
states have raised their own minimum 
wages,

56
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:24,810
30 of which are higher than the federal,
most notably of all,

57
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:29,830
California just voted to raise its 
minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2022.

58
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,173
That's something that was unthinkable 
even five years ago in New York did the 

59
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:40,081
same a short time after this movement.
The fight for 15 is part of a new story.

60
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:45,070
The story that believes in finally 
growing the wages of the middle class so

61
00:03:45,071 --> 00:03:45,904
that their collective purchasing power,
their demand can grow the economy 

62
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,253
organically in a way that's not 
dependent on speculation or financial 

63
00:03:53,891 --> 00:03:54,724
bubbles.
It believes in regulating the abuses of 

64
00:03:56,891 --> 00:03:57,724
Wall Street and making what should be 
accessible to all education and 

65
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,530
healthcare.
Part of our comments,

66
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:05,140
again,
there are no shortage of articles.

67
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:07,960
Politicians or studies showing,
for example,

68
00:04:07,961 --> 00:04:11,710
that increasing the minimum wage is a 
risky gamble or a job killer.

69
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:15,370
No shortage of doomsday forecasting that
prices would rise,

70
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
but remember that this status quo has a 
huge interest in maintaining itself just

71
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:22,983
like a boss.
It uses threats to keep the society in 

72
00:04:25,511 --> 00:04:26,344
line.
Here's a Meta analysis of pretty much 

73
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,570
every single minimum wage study,
the closer to the top,

74
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,210
the more precise and accurate the study 
is,

75
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,373
and this shows that all the most 
comprehensive analysis of the minimum 

76
00:04:37,661 --> 00:04:41,980
wage show that it would have little to 
no negative effect on employment lows,

77
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,323
and yet it could raise the incomes and 
standards of living of millions in 

78
00:04:47,591 --> 00:04:48,424
places where the minimum wage has 
increased like Seattle prices haven't 

79
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:51,820
skyrocketed.

80
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:52,653
Instead,
people are actually able to buy the 

81
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:59,620
things they've consistently increased 
their productivity to produce.

82
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:00,733
Minimum wage increases,
won't solve all the problems in the 

83
00:05:03,251 --> 00:05:04,390
economy,
not even close,

84
00:05:04,391 --> 00:05:05,224
it's just one thing,
but the victory of an idea that runs 

85
00:05:08,591 --> 00:05:13,330
counter to the dominant ideology is 
hugely significant.

86
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,490
Otto von Bismarck said that politics is 
the art of the possible,

87
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:20,043
but I think that sometimes invoking the 
possible is just another tactic and 

88
00:05:24,301 --> 00:05:25,134
other negotiating strategy,
another threat used on behalf of the 

89
00:05:28,391 --> 00:05:29,224
status quo.
To restrict the movement of alternative 

90
00:05:31,721 --> 00:05:32,554
ideas,
the story of this economy has been 

91
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:37,750
laboring under for 40 years,
is failing.

92
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,780
People feel it even if they don't know 
why.

93
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,580
A moment like this is when alternative 
ideas can populate the center.

94
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:47,283
So maybe it's time to stop leading with 
what is possible and start leading with 

95
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:58,350
what's right.
Hey everybody,

96
00:06:03,081 --> 00:06:03,914
thanks for watching the.
I have to thank Nick Hanauer who helped 

97
00:06:05,961 --> 00:06:10,310
me research and sponsored this video.
He's been an activist in the fight for a

98
00:06:10,311 --> 00:06:13,070
$15 minimum wage movement for a long 
time.

99
00:06:13,071 --> 00:06:15,680
He's written a lot about it and he's got
a great ted talk too,

100
00:06:15,681 --> 00:06:17,570
which I'll link to over there.
Definitely watch that.

101
