Hello little turtles and Octopi coffee 
on a Tuesday and blog,

2
00:00:03,901 --> 00:00:05,220
54

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,980
at night.
I often wonder what I imagined is not an

4
00:00:19,981 --> 00:00:23,760
uncommon reverie.
If there are aliens out there on planets

5
00:00:23,761 --> 00:00:28,260
orbiting distant stars looking up and 
wondering the exact same thing.

6
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:31,680
If they have evolved like us to build 
massive powerful telescopes,

7
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,440
they of course see turning the lens in 
our direction,

8
00:00:34,441 --> 00:00:39,441
the great spiral that is the Milky Way,
a kind of motion in celestial stillness,

9
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,480
but that's not all dates.
Zooming out a bit more,

10
00:00:42,481 --> 00:00:43,314
they'd catch a pair of bright clouds 
looking almost like children chasing 

11
00:00:46,531 --> 00:00:49,390
each other in empty space around their 
parent galaxy.

12
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:50,243
Older and larger sibling would appear 
about a 10th as bright as the Milky Way 

13
00:00:53,311 --> 00:00:56,400
and the smaller siblings about a fourth,
as bright as that.

14
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:00,660
These are the magellanic clouds just to 
have over a dozen satellite galaxies are

15
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,720
orbiting the Milky Way.
What makes these two so distinct is that

16
00:01:03,721 --> 00:01:06,630
unlike their brethren,
there are still alive with the materials

17
00:01:06,631 --> 00:01:08,370
necessary for making stars.

18
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:09,203
In fact,
the larger Magellanic cloud is so 

19
00:01:10,561 --> 00:01:13,380
fertile,
it boasts the largest stellar nursery in

20
00:01:13,381 --> 00:01:14,214
our local group.
Beating out the vastly bigger Andromeda 

21
00:01:16,081 --> 00:01:16,914
galaxy and even our own Milky Way.
Most galactic satellites are dead in 

22
00:01:20,101 --> 00:01:20,934
this respect.
The Gargantuan Gravitational Force of 

23
00:01:22,531 --> 00:01:27,210
the parent galaxy usually robs them of 
their gas in a process known as titled,

24
00:01:27,211 --> 00:01:28,740
stripping.
Without gas,

25
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:29,873
there can be no stars.
These dark dwarf steroidals are the 

26
00:01:32,011 --> 00:01:34,430
haunted houses.
Have a galactic subgroups,

27
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,273
so faintly do they move across the sky 
that the first one discovered the 

28
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:38,933
sculptor tour in 1938,
was mistaken for a fingerprint on a 

29
00:01:42,091 --> 00:01:42,924
photographic plate.
Why then or the Magellanic cloud still 

30
00:01:44,881 --> 00:01:45,570
viable?
Well,

31
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:48,720
new data from the Hubble is starting to 
reveal some clues.

32
00:01:48,721 --> 00:01:49,554
Yellow astronomer,
each a colleague whose name I've just 

33
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,333
murdered,
says that there are likely passing us 

34
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,273
for the very first time.
This means their orbits once thought to 

35
00:01:58,531 --> 00:02:02,040
be one to 2 billion years around the 
Milky Way might be much,

36
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,080
much longer.
They only got close to us.

37
00:02:04,081 --> 00:02:07,950
It seemed some 200 million years ago,
which is to say just now,

38
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:08,813
for all that previous time they were as 
the man indeed and astronomer named 

39
00:02:18,731 --> 00:02:19,564
Martina Bates,
left from Columbia University thinks 

40
00:02:21,491 --> 00:02:22,324
that the smaller cloud actually smashed 
right through the larger initiating an 

41
00:02:25,871 --> 00:02:29,410
accelerated star creation and leaving 
many of its own stars

42
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,640
behind.
And you know,

43
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:40,630
as I was reading this article in 
scientific American from which I learned

44
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,070
many of these things,

45
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,673
I had a thought.

46
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:45,603
I was thinking how noteworthy it is that
the mechanics of nature so mimic the 

47
00:02:51,941 --> 00:02:54,350
emotional mechanics of our lives.
I mean,

48
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,153
have you ever

49
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:57,123
smashed right into somebody?
Have you move through someone and not 

50
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,760
afterwards retained some of their own 
stars?

51
00:03:03,761 --> 00:03:04,594
Do we not like these brilliant clouds 
leave a trail of ourselves in the wake 

52
00:03:07,811 --> 00:03:08,644
of our movement through the world?
What is this parallelism between nature 

53
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:17,080
and humanity?
I began to think the mighty heaven says,

54
00:03:17,081 --> 00:03:22,081
the philosopher PROC lists exhibits in 
its transfigurations clear images of the

55
00:03:22,121 --> 00:03:27,121
splendor of intellectual perceptions.
And as the Magellanic clouds move closer

56
00:03:27,281 --> 00:03:28,114
in their transit to the Milky Way,
the nearer is pulled away from its 

57
00:03:31,421 --> 00:03:32,254
partner and left at such a distance,
as would make it impossible for the 

58
00:03:35,201 --> 00:03:36,034
dance to continue.
The lesser fractured from its earlier 

59
00:03:38,981 --> 00:03:43,981
collision will hurdle in the dark to a 
gas lists fate and empty nursery,

60
00:03:44,831 --> 00:03:48,340
some haunted fingerprint on the 
photographic plate.

61
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:03,963
The Universe is the externalization of 
the soul wherever the life is that 

62
00:04:08,021 --> 00:04:08,854
bursts into appearance around it.
Our science is central and therefore 

63
00:04:12,281 --> 00:04:14,380
superficial.
The earth and the heavenly bodies,

64
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,423
physics and chemistry,
we sensually treat as if they were self 

65
00:04:18,311 --> 00:04:19,144
existent.
But these are the retinue of the being 

66
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:24,610
that we have.
