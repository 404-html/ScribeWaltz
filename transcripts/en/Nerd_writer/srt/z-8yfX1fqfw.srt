00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:05,210
Hey everybody,
welcome to a little impromptu nerd,

2
00:00:05,211 --> 00:00:09,970
writer q and a filmed on my new fisheye 
iphone lends attachment,

3
00:00:09,971 --> 00:00:12,640
which I'm really excited about.
I put on twitter for questions.

4
00:00:12,641 --> 00:00:14,800
You guys put a lot of cool ones in 
there.

5
00:00:14,801 --> 00:00:19,540
So let's get right down to it at Daemen.
Five wants to know what is your research

6
00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:20,840
process like?
Um,

7
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:21,893
so my research process has always been 
the same and the way that it works is 

8
00:00:24,611 --> 00:00:25,890
when I pick a topic,
um,

9
00:00:25,891 --> 00:00:28,240
and that's a whole nother story,
but when I finally choose one,

10
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:32,110
I kind of immersed myself in everything 
that I could possibly read about it.

11
00:00:32,111 --> 00:00:33,910
I read articles,
academic journals.

12
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,730
I got to log in from a Grad school 
friend of mine.

13
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:38,650
They'll tell anybody,
uh,

14
00:00:38,651 --> 00:00:41,920
and I,
I read as much as I can about it until I

15
00:00:41,921 --> 00:00:44,680
feel sort of comfortable with the issue 
that,

16
00:00:44,681 --> 00:00:46,810
that,
that I know everything.

17
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:51,340
And then I kind of let the structure of 
what the video is going to be bubbled up

18
00:00:51,341 --> 00:00:53,020
into my head.
That's always how it works.

19
00:00:53,021 --> 00:00:53,854
Eventually I'll get to a point where the
structure of the video I say we'll just 

20
00:00:58,001 --> 00:01:00,370
become apparent.
I don't know why that is,

21
00:01:00,371 --> 00:01:01,204
but it just happens.
And then I'll start to write a going on 

22
00:01:03,641 --> 00:01:04,810
from there,
you know,

23
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:05,981
either.
All right,

24
00:01:05,981 --> 00:01:08,540
the whole script and then edit over it.
Um,

25
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:11,110
or all right.
The first part of it and think,

26
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:11,973
well,
I have to edit this to know what comes 

27
00:01:14,321 --> 00:01:16,330
next.
Once I edit this first part,

28
00:01:16,331 --> 00:01:19,870
I'll see what the rhythm is like and 
then I can write the next part of it.

29
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:22,510
So it depends on the topic and it 
happens in different ways.

30
00:01:22,511 --> 00:01:23,170
But,
um,

31
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:24,003
the research processes intensive,
I only have like a week or a couple of 

32
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,500
weeks to do the research proper for a 
video.

33
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,100
So I dive in heart at Devante wants to 
know,

34
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:35,470
do you have a preferred Stanley Kubrick 
film?

35
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,660
Um,
I'd have to say 2001.

36
00:01:37,661 --> 00:01:38,494
A space odyssey at the rising tides 
wants to know what tips do you have for 

37
00:01:41,081 --> 00:01:44,680
people looking to get into video essays 
other than just start?

38
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:45,773
Um,
so he's referring to a tweet that I put 

39
00:01:47,111 --> 00:01:47,944
out recently where I said that so many 
people will actually messaged me 

40
00:01:50,201 --> 00:01:52,150
everyday to say that they want to get 
into this,

41
00:01:52,151 --> 00:01:55,480
but they don't know where to start.
And my advice is the same for everybody.

42
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:56,733
It's just start.
And that might sound a little bit 

43
00:01:58,091 --> 00:01:58,924
reductive,
but it's really the best advice that I 

44
00:02:01,001 --> 00:02:01,751
could give.
You know,

45
00:02:01,751 --> 00:02:02,584
so many people I know never get past the
idea phase or the conceptualizing phase 

46
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:12,210
and what creative work requires is that 
you make something,

47
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,533
finish it,
identify what you didn't like about it 

48
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:17,620
and approve on it in the next one.

49
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:18,483
Youtube is unique and awesome for that 
reason because I get to put a video out 

50
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:22,774
every weekend and every week I look at 
it and get a chance to improve a little 

51
00:02:26,051 --> 00:02:26,884
bit.
But if I had never put something out 

52
00:02:27,341 --> 00:02:28,850
there,
if I had delayed,

53
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,670
delayed until,
until the thing was perfect,

54
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,010
I never would have gotten to where I am 
today.

55
00:02:33,011 --> 00:02:33,844
You know,
the only important thing in the 

56
00:02:34,871 --> 00:02:38,080
beginning is that you're confident and 
that you put something out there.

57
00:02:38,081 --> 00:02:41,050
And then if you know somebody who is 
trying to do this,

58
00:02:41,051 --> 00:02:41,884
that you give them the encouragement to 
actually start because that's the 

59
00:02:44,951 --> 00:02:45,784
hardest part.
Eventually you can give them 

60
00:02:47,231 --> 00:02:50,350
constructive criticism when they've 
established themselves a little bit.

61
00:02:50,351 --> 00:02:53,490
But in the beginning,
encouragement is key at neo too.

62
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,470
What John Wants to know.
Expanding beyond nerd writer,

63
00:02:56,471 --> 00:02:59,110
what is your longterm goal?
That's a good question.

64
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,390
Now.
I love the Internet.

65
00:03:01,391 --> 00:03:05,260
I love Youtube and I wouldn't rather be 
doing anything else.

66
00:03:05,261 --> 00:03:06,094
It's afforded me the opportunity to,
to have a career in which my creative 

67
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:10,803
output is 100 percent mine.
They editorial control is 100 percent 

68
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:14,944
mine.
No one else even works on the nerd 

69
00:03:15,711 --> 00:03:17,440
writer channel.
And that's really cool.

70
00:03:17,441 --> 00:03:18,274
I mean,
I've talked to and had conference calls 

71
00:03:19,751 --> 00:03:22,300
about potential things and other kinds 
of media,

72
00:03:22,301 --> 00:03:23,134
which is exciting,
but I'm not totally sure that I want to 

73
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:29,980
go those routes and give up the control 
that I have here because that has gotten

74
00:03:29,981 --> 00:03:31,900
to me,
were gotten me where I am today.

75
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:36,400
And people like the Vlog brothers who 
have rejected,

76
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:38,890
uh,
opportunities in legacy media is a real.

77
00:03:38,891 --> 00:03:39,724
I think,
um,

78
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:45,190
the real pioneers for people who want to
stay online at Mad Mozelle wants to know

79
00:03:45,551 --> 00:03:49,660
how to find one's purpose in life,
stick to a thing or keep searching.

80
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:54,370
Now this is a huge question.
I'm probably not qualified to answer it,

81
00:03:54,371 --> 00:03:55,204
but as far as purpose goes,
I think that there's a real tragedy 

82
00:03:58,571 --> 00:03:59,404
there,
which is that I think we're obviously 

83
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:04,000
not given any kind of objective or 
cosmic purpose.

84
00:04:04,001 --> 00:04:06,520
I don't believe that.
I don't believe that that exists or that

85
00:04:06,521 --> 00:04:07,354
you can find that,
but I think that even personally there 

86
00:04:10,431 --> 00:04:14,440
is nothing that there's no purpose that 
you have that you don't choose.

87
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:18,370
That's kind of how it works.
You have to choose your purpose and that

88
00:04:18,371 --> 00:04:20,050
choice is,
it's pretty much arbitrary.

89
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:22,330
People who say that they were born to do
this are born to do that.

90
00:04:22,331 --> 00:04:23,164
I feel like either they're,
they don't know that they're lying to 

91
00:04:25,211 --> 00:04:26,044
themselves or there's a little bit of 
self deception they are going on and 

92
00:04:27,731 --> 00:04:29,620
that's really hard.
If you come out of college and you don't

93
00:04:29,621 --> 00:04:31,700
know what you want to do and you feel 
like I,

94
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:33,750
I can't figure out what I want to do,
nothing,

95
00:04:33,751 --> 00:04:34,840
it's just occurring to me.

96
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,410
It's because nothing will occur to you.
You just have to choose at.

97
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:39,244
Darren Robertson wants to know.
I've seen people write off your videos 

98
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,360
as pretentious mostly because of how you
speak in them.

99
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:46,300
How do you feel about this?
I've seen those comments.

100
00:04:46,301 --> 00:04:47,134
I probably am pretentious,
so I don't really have that much of a 

101
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:52,090
response to that,
but you know,

102
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:53,580
as far as the way that I talk,
you know,

103
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:54,423
that's just the way that I talk.
I never ever tried to talk a certain 

104
00:04:56,831 --> 00:04:57,664
way.
People talk a lot about the pauses at 

105
00:04:59,111 --> 00:05:00,510
the end of my videos.
You know,

106
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,470
if you're an editor and you've edited 
for a long time,

107
00:05:02,471 --> 00:05:03,304
you learn to do things by instinct.
Then as far as those final lines in 

108
00:05:07,421 --> 00:05:08,254
every video go,
that's just the instinct of the rhythm 

109
00:05:09,551 --> 00:05:11,120
that I feel works.
So I,

110
00:05:11,121 --> 00:05:13,420
I always just go by my editing instinct.

111
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:14,800
Um,
and you know,

112
00:05:14,801 --> 00:05:15,634
I've,
I've paid more attention to it as more 

113
00:05:16,301 --> 00:05:19,870
people have brought it up and tried to 
like make the pauses a little less.

114
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:20,801
Um,
but,

115
00:05:20,801 --> 00:05:23,110
you know,
I'm just doing whatever I feel is right.

116
00:05:23,111 --> 00:05:24,790
It's all I can do.
And uh,

117
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,380
you know,
any accusations of,

118
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:27,243
you know,
a lot of my favorite creators have been 

119
00:05:28,301 --> 00:05:30,050
called potential,
so I'm,

120
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,760
I'm pretty okay with being put in that 
company at Ben Hawkes says,

121
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:36,580
what about a video of your impressions 
on your trip to France last summer?

122
00:05:36,581 --> 00:05:39,650
Why can't believe you remember that?
I did make a little video about that and

123
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,513
watch it here at Bryan spargo rights.
What do you think has been the biggest 

124
00:05:43,151 --> 00:05:46,110
tool for your growth and outreach?
Social media,

125
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,900
word of mouth or your own marketing?
The biggest tool for growth and outreach

126
00:05:49,901 --> 00:05:50,734
for me has just been grinding out the 
video's pushing through the times in 

127
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:54,394
which nobody was watching in the 
beginning and then the plateaus of not 

128
00:05:57,801 --> 00:06:00,420
much subscriber growth in the middle 
because that,

129
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,293
that I think will happen to everybody,
but I try to make my headlines as good 

130
00:06:03,561 --> 00:06:04,100
as possible.

131
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,550
I sort of hate headlining,
I hate clickbait.

132
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,513
I try to do my best to,
to sort of walk the line of being not 

133
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:12,830
too click Baity,
but being not too boring because now the

134
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:15,050
truth is people look at,
you know,

135
00:06:15,051 --> 00:06:19,340
they look at a million links a day and 
if you can't grab them a little bit with

136
00:06:19,341 --> 00:06:21,230
your headline or your thumbnail,
they're not going to watch you.

137
00:06:21,231 --> 00:06:22,820
So you think you have to be cognizant of
that.

138
00:06:22,821 --> 00:06:23,654
And Hank Green actually wrote a great 
article on medium where he talks about 

139
00:06:26,091 --> 00:06:26,924
how,
you know,

140
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:30,950
you shouldn't feel bad about clickbait 
titles if the content you're giving them

141
00:06:30,951 --> 00:06:33,260
as good work at j dot Williams.
Jay wants to know,

142
00:06:33,261 --> 00:06:36,050
what are some of your favorite novels?
Um,

143
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:36,770
I,
I,

144
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:38,300
I have to mention him.
John Harrison,

145
00:06:38,301 --> 00:06:39,134
again,
I always mentioned he's my favorite 

146
00:06:40,521 --> 00:06:41,880
novelist.
And so,

147
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,510
so,
so obscure.

148
00:06:44,511 --> 00:06:44,991
It's,
it's,

149
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,471
it's,
it's a,

150
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:49,730
it's a real tragedy and he's written a 
science fiction and literary fiction.

151
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:51,680
But I suggest you start with the novel 
light,

152
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:54,470
which is so good.
And I think you'll go on to read more of

153
00:06:54,471 --> 00:06:56,420
his after you read that one.
I'm also,

154
00:06:56,421 --> 00:06:58,280
I have to mention Lawrence Durrell,
who is,

155
00:06:58,281 --> 00:07:00,770
um,
who wrote the Alexandria Quartet and the

156
00:07:00,771 --> 00:07:01,750
Avignon quinten.
I've,

157
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:04,760
I've read most of what he's written also
kind of forgotten novelists,

158
00:07:04,761 --> 00:07:05,594
but his sort of theories and treatments 
of personality and friendship and 

159
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:14,060
relationships form the kind of basis of 
my philosophy of,

160
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:19,090
of relationships.
And I can't recommend him enough.

161
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:22,280
So check out Lawrence Darell really good
stuff that's stolen.

162
00:07:22,281 --> 00:07:23,114
PVP wants to know which presidential 
candidate seems competent this election 

163
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,103
year.
I'm not going to get into who I support 

164
00:07:28,221 --> 00:07:29,054
officially,
but I do really want to recommend a 

165
00:07:30,141 --> 00:07:32,850
website called [inaudible] dot org,
um,

166
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:33,703
in which you are.com
and which you are given questions about 

167
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:37,423
a lot of different issues and you're,
you're lined up with the candidate that 

168
00:07:40,011 --> 00:07:41,600
most represents your interests.

169
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,770
My sister who took it last week said 
that everyone should be required to take

170
00:07:45,771 --> 00:07:46,604
this little survey because I think 
that's a big problem with democracy in 

171
00:07:49,251 --> 00:07:51,350
our country is that people don't vote 
their interests.

172
00:07:51,351 --> 00:07:53,630
They don't know,
you know,

173
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:58,520
on a granular level what candidate 
supports what issue on what level.

174
00:07:58,521 --> 00:08:01,010
And I think knowing those things would 
help.

175
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:01,903
All of us had a break through the noise 
and see who will actually represent us 

176
00:08:06,021 --> 00:08:10,040
the way we want to be represented at pip
head to says tips for young writers.

177
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:11,390
Yes,
write more.

178
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:14,630
I've written hundreds of thousands of 
words since I started writing them.

179
00:08:14,631 --> 00:08:15,464
In the beginning it was crap and I knew 
it was crap and I hated it because like 

180
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,870
Ira glass one said my tastes with so 
much better.

181
00:08:20,871 --> 00:08:23,840
I want it to be like the people I love,
but I couldn't achieve it.

182
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,753
If you write a lot,
I think you'll see improvement in your 

183
00:08:28,191 --> 00:08:31,490
writing way quicker than you think.
I mean,

184
00:08:31,491 --> 00:08:32,324
it's not gonna happen overnight,
but improvement happens when you just 

185
00:08:34,911 --> 00:08:37,430
put the work in that uh,
Paul John Cannon wants to know,

186
00:08:37,431 --> 00:08:40,310
would you ever consider touring slash 
giving talks to promote your videos?

187
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,213
That's actually a great question because
I'm going to be giving my first Tedx 

188
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:44,623
talk in Pennsylvania,
actually near my hometown at Lafayette 

189
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,670
College next month.
And I'm really excited about that.

190
00:08:49,671 --> 00:08:52,460
I'm going to be talking about video 
essays and what they are.

191
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:56,020
So I think I will be doing more of this 
moving forward and uh,

192
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:57,960
I just want to make sure that it's 
great.

193
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:01,740
I want the speeches to be great.
So I'm going to be taking a week off,

194
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:03,750
I think this week that you're seeing 
this too,

195
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:04,584
right?
That ted talk and make sure that it's 

196
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,240
really good and up to snuff at social on
wants to know what is your setup,

197
00:09:09,241 --> 00:09:10,440
what programs do you use?

198
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:14,070
I'm just quickly.
I use final cut pro 10 and then a lot of

199
00:09:14,071 --> 00:09:14,904
people hate that program,
but Toni Jo at every frame convinced me 

200
00:09:17,671 --> 00:09:21,610
to use it and I actually really love it 
now and I mean it does everything I need

201
00:09:21,611 --> 00:09:22,141
it to do.
Oh,

202
00:09:22,141 --> 00:09:24,600
and the mic that this is an old Mc and 
people ask like,

203
00:09:24,601 --> 00:09:27,150
why is it so beat up around here?
It's because fall off my desk a bunch of

204
00:09:27,151 --> 00:09:28,420
times.
Um,

205
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:30,020
it's an old mike from best buy.
I can't,

206
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:30,993
I don't know if you can get any more,
but I really like the quality of it at 

207
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:34,423
ballsy.
Wants to know who is your favorite 

208
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:37,500
youtuber and who you get inspired by the
most.

209
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:38,820
Um,
so I just,

210
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:40,920
I'll split this question into two parts 
really quickly.

211
00:09:40,921 --> 00:09:42,420
First,
on a formal level,

212
00:09:42,421 --> 00:09:43,254
a lot of people love him,
but Casey Neistat is a real inspiration 

213
00:09:45,031 --> 00:09:48,840
for me because I think he's doing 
something that he's,

214
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,411
he's,
he's,

215
00:09:49,411 --> 00:09:53,790
he's pioneering a style that is 
completely unique to online video.

216
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,030
That's what I want to see more of.
And on a content level,

217
00:09:57,031 --> 00:09:59,940
I love the video essays that box is 
making right now.

218
00:09:59,941 --> 00:10:01,760
I think there are sort of,
you know,

219
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:05,130
they're the most prestige video essays 
from a corporation that I've seen.

220
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,780
I love New York Times.
Op Docs are too.

221
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,173
Also.
I really love every frame of painting 

222
00:10:10,501 --> 00:10:13,020
and Adam Westbrook's video essays at 
[inaudible] Dot TV.

223
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,220
I'm,
I'll put some more in the description at

224
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,250
Calabasas or wants to know,
do like pancakes.

225
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:18,143
Yes.
Obviously Atlanta home age wants to 

226
00:10:20,251 --> 00:10:21,660
know,
what were you doing before youtube?

227
00:10:21,661 --> 00:10:23,520
I might have answered this before,
but before,

228
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,350
directly,
before I was doing this full time,

229
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,540
was working at discovery discovery 
digital network,

230
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:29,340
uh,
producing a show called secret daily,

231
00:10:29,341 --> 00:10:31,770
which I wrote and hosted.
That was loosely,

232
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,840
very loosely based on the nerd writer.
Um,

233
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:34,763
they got me from MSNBC,
MSNBC got me from a video that I did a 

234
00:10:38,891 --> 00:10:39,724
while ago on the kind fund and then 
before that I was just doing odd jobs 

235
00:10:42,121 --> 00:10:45,150
and I tell them marketed for car 
warranties,

236
00:10:45,151 --> 00:10:46,110
which was so horrible.

237
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:47,360
And then,
uh,

238
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,370
before that I was in school.
Um,

239
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,213
so it's been a wild ride since I 
graduated and I'm glad I finally ended 

240
00:10:52,801 --> 00:10:53,634
up here working for myself,
not in an office because I hate offices 

241
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,080
so much at Tilghman.
Trevor wants to know what do you make of

242
00:11:01,081 --> 00:11:03,870
rotten tomatoes effect on modern day 
film culture?

243
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,670
That's a great question.
I,

244
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,533
you know,
I always check rotten tomatoes before 

245
00:11:07,441 --> 00:11:08,274
going to see a movie just because I 
don't want to spend $15 or $18 with 

246
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:16,530
ticket prices so high on seeing an okay 
movie.

247
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:17,603
I think the negative side of that is 
that we lose the ability to see nuance 

248
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,633
in our films and see the great things 
and bad movies or see the bad things in 

249
00:11:24,631 --> 00:11:26,970
good movies,
but you know,

250
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,360
maybe I'll just see nuance when I can 
watch it at home at Louis [inaudible] to

251
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:33,203
know in your opinion,
which is the best youtube video you 

252
00:11:34,441 --> 00:11:34,890
posted.

253
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:35,723
I really liked the video I did on 
Rihanna and dance hall just because it 

254
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:39,564
was a challenge to figure out how to 
express those ideas visually and once I 

255
00:11:42,331 --> 00:11:44,420
hit on how to do it,
um,

256
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:45,683
I was really excited.
And what is the most fun for me is 

257
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:52,080
experimenting with visual styles,
doing things that are new,

258
00:11:52,081 --> 00:11:52,914
innovating,
always trying to push the envelope a 

259
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:55,930
little bit to do something that people 
haven't done before.

260
00:11:55,931 --> 00:11:56,764
So that one I really loved.
I really loved my actually death with 

261
00:11:59,141 --> 00:12:00,130
dignity video.
I did.

262
00:12:00,131 --> 00:12:02,080
I tried a lot of interesting things 
there.

263
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,410
Anything that you see for me that is 
experimental,

264
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,600
just know that I was having a lot of fun
making it silent.

265
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:10,450
But sure,
nine months to know if you were a song,

266
00:12:10,451 --> 00:12:11,284
what song would you be?
I hope I'm doing a day in the life by 

267
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:16,900
the Beatles because that's my favorite 
song and I'd like to be my favorite song

268
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:17,740
at Souza.

269
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:18,573
Eduardo wants to know what's the role of
art and these postmodern filter bubble 

270
00:12:21,551 --> 00:12:24,520
internet days and how can we really 
connect to each other?

271
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:28,390
Well that's not.
I love the term postmodern filter.

272
00:12:28,391 --> 00:12:31,060
Bubble Internet days is a great for an 
album or a book.

273
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:33,003
I think,
you know,

274
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:33,983
it's interesting question because art 
clearly doesn't have the weight that it 

275
00:12:36,221 --> 00:12:37,480
used to have and there's never going to 
be,

276
00:12:37,481 --> 00:12:40,480
I think a dickens again,
but you know,

277
00:12:40,481 --> 00:12:42,910
I could make something and the whole 
world can see it.

278
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:44,163
It might be a little bit more fleeting 
than a past works past novels or past 

279
00:12:48,431 --> 00:12:50,650
sort of mediums,
but you know,

280
00:12:50,651 --> 00:12:51,484
it's a,
it's a whole new world and we have to 

281
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:54,124
work with the Times that we have as far 
as how do we really connect to each 

282
00:12:56,231 --> 00:12:57,064
other.
I mean got to just make friends and be 

283
00:13:00,881 --> 00:13:01,300
with people.

284
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:01,991
I mean,
you know,

285
00:13:01,991 --> 00:13:05,680
Internet is great and I have a lot of 
people who I communicate with you on the

286
00:13:05,681 --> 00:13:08,500
Internet and people communicate with me 
through my videos,

287
00:13:08,501 --> 00:13:09,334
but my actual physical friendships and 
relationships are the most important 

288
00:13:13,841 --> 00:13:17,290
thing to me in the world and we have to 
cultivate those I think because it keeps

289
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:18,124
us grounded and I love those people.
I Love My friends at Collin mx 31 wants 

290
00:13:21,761 --> 00:13:22,594
to know,
do you work off a template or have a 

291
00:13:24,521 --> 00:13:25,630
formula of some sort?
No,

292
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:29,110
I don't have a template and it would be 
no fun for me at all if I did.

293
00:13:29,111 --> 00:13:29,944
I mean that's part of the reason why I 
left discovery digital networks because 

294
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,333
the strictures of producing one video a 
day meant that I then everything had to 

295
00:13:36,431 --> 00:13:37,264
be templatized.
The editor is only had half a day to 

296
00:13:38,981 --> 00:13:41,890
work on it,
so everything had to look the same every

297
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:46,300
day and we sort of slotted as script 
into this be rolled formula.

298
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:49,510
That just wasn't interesting to me.
I think every piece of content has to be

299
00:13:49,511 --> 00:13:50,344
mapped with a form that is unique to it.
At vague solutions wants to know what's 

300
00:13:54,281 --> 00:13:56,160
the way to your heart?
Well,

301
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,700
you should probably ask my girlfriend 
about that.

302
00:13:57,701 --> 00:13:58,534
The amazing,
incredible Lisette Videa who hosts d 

303
00:14:01,211 --> 00:14:03,940
news.
She is the love of my life.

304
00:14:03,941 --> 00:14:04,774
I couldn't possibly love anyone more.
And she's talented and beautiful and 

305
00:14:07,811 --> 00:14:10,450
funny and weird like me in all those 
ways.

306
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:12,010
Um,
so check out her stuff.

307
00:14:12,011 --> 00:14:14,770
I'll link it here.
I love you at Citizen Austin.

308
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:15,604
One wants to know,
are there any films you could consider 

309
00:14:16,571 --> 00:14:17,404
it to be flawless of two films,
the big Lebowski and hot fuzz that keep 

310
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:22,360
calm,
read and wants to know.

311
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,194
I read your book,
Big City and loved it and he plans on 

312
00:14:24,761 --> 00:14:28,330
reading any more novels.
So I thank you for reading big city.

313
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:30,280
I sort of cringe when I read that now.
Um,

314
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,980
I wrote two novels that,
and another one which I never put out,

315
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:35,680
which I cringe even more to read,
but I,

316
00:14:35,681 --> 00:14:36,281
I,
you know,

317
00:14:36,281 --> 00:14:37,114
I love fiction.
I just think I love this a little more 

318
00:14:39,131 --> 00:14:43,270
and I knew that as I was starting this 
channel as learning that.

319
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:45,820
And um,
I have a third book that I'm writing now

320
00:14:45,821 --> 00:14:49,180
which is hard side pie and it's so cool,
but I just don't have the time.

321
00:14:49,181 --> 00:14:50,014
If you've written a novel,
you know that you have to really devote 

322
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:55,310
all your time to it because you have to 
sort of stay in the story in your mind.

323
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,400
I don't have the time to do that now.
Hopefully sometime in the future.

324
00:14:58,401 --> 00:14:59,234
I'd love for you guys to read it.
I was thinking about like putting it 

325
00:15:00,771 --> 00:15:01,604
out,
putting it out chapter by chapter and 

326
00:15:03,321 --> 00:15:04,130
letting you guys read it.

327
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:05,060
What,
what do you think about that?

328
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:05,923
Let me know in the comments.
Yeah.

329
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:07,760
Jay Sean wants to know how do you feel 
about Internet memes?

330
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:08,623
Just quickly,
I'd like to say that I love Internet 

331
00:15:09,621 --> 00:15:14,540
memes and nothing makes me laugh harder 
than some of the jokes on imager.

332
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:16,063
I don't know what it is.
It's like a whole new form of ultra 

333
00:15:18,561 --> 00:15:22,730
aggressive comedy that has ruined me for
a lot of other kinds of comedy.

334
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,593
And finally at Joseph Wallace wants to 
know what are the key components of a 

335
00:15:26,361 --> 00:15:27,194
great video essay?
How do you make people care about 

336
00:15:29,211 --> 00:15:31,690
something they didn't know before?
Um,

337
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,713
so this is,
this is really my job and I think the 

338
00:15:34,641 --> 00:15:36,680
most important thing is that you develop
a narrative,

339
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:37,970
uh,
about a,

340
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,650
about a topic,
about an issue,

341
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:42,260
you know,
you can present facts and information,

342
00:15:42,261 --> 00:15:46,580
but I think people really latch onto 
stories and that's what I try to do with

343
00:15:46,581 --> 00:15:47,414
every video.

344
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:49,730
You know,
this is a metaphor that I love,

345
00:15:49,731 --> 00:15:53,090
which is that I'm on film sets.
When you're a lighting them,

346
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:53,973
you know,
the way that it looks on the set has 

347
00:15:55,311 --> 00:15:56,480
nothing,
you know,

348
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:59,030
it doesn't look anything like the way 
that it looks when you see it on film,

349
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:00,163
but gaffers and directors of photography
know how that sort of weird code of how 

350
00:16:05,961 --> 00:16:08,090
to light something on a set to make it 
look a certain way.

351
00:16:08,091 --> 00:16:13,091
You just have to practice and know it.
And I think when I'm doing a video essay

352
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,144
on something,
what I'm trying to do is create a kind 

353
00:16:15,771 --> 00:16:16,604
of all chemical reaction in the story 
that I'm telling that makes you as 

354
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:22,430
inspired about this thing as I am.
Like I said before,

355
00:16:22,431 --> 00:16:25,430
these are primers and essays,
which means they're short.

356
00:16:25,431 --> 00:16:26,264
So I hope that I've inspired you enough,
like the greatest teachers I've had to 

357
00:16:29,451 --> 00:16:31,100
go out and learn more about it.

358
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:32,203
Um,
so I think narrative story is the most 

359
00:16:34,221 --> 00:16:37,190
important thing.
Getting people engaged in something that

360
00:16:37,191 --> 00:16:40,160
they wouldn't have thought they could 
have liked before.

361
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,230
Okay.
That was so much fun.

362
00:16:42,231 --> 00:16:43,064
Thank you for asking your questions.
I really appreciated all the questions 

363
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:47,040
you put in there.
Um,

364
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,223
I'm not that great of an extemporaneous 
talker of the nerdwriter is all about 

365
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:52,003
sort of writing and articulating the way
that I feel about something before 

366
00:16:55,131 --> 00:16:55,964
presenting it.
So that's the way I like to communicate 

367
00:16:58,191 --> 00:16:59,024
normally,
but I think this is a good opportunity 

368
00:16:59,871 --> 00:17:00,704
to put a,
put a lot of things on record about how 

369
00:17:02,241 --> 00:17:03,970
I feel about stuff and,
and,

370
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:08,270
and I appreciate your interest always.
Thank you so much for watching.

371
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:13,100
Thank you for continuing to watch.
I am working my ass off here to make the

372
00:17:13,101 --> 00:17:15,590
best possible video is for you that I 
can.

373
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,030
Um,
and uh,

374
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:19,820
and yeah,
I'll see you for the next video.
