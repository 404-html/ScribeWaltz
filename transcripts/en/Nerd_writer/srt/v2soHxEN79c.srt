1
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:04,950
Okay,
let's clear something up.

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:06,083
The enemy ghost in the shell from 1995 
and the live action ghost in the shell 

3
00:00:09,781 --> 00:00:12,810
from earlier this year are not the same 
movie.

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,360
They're both adopted from the same 
universe,

5
00:00:15,361 --> 00:00:18,570
originally created in the Manga by have 
mooney sheer route,

6
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,090
but they pulled from different parts of 
that universe.

7
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:22,103
Unfortunately,
the popularity of the 1995 animated 

8
00:00:24,751 --> 00:00:25,584
features seems to have convinced someone
that it was a good idea to graft images 

9
00:00:29,551 --> 00:00:33,780
and sequences from that movie onto a 
completely different story.

10
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,430
Don't get me wrong,
I like images as much as the next guy,

11
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:47,260
but the ones in ghost in the shell 2017 
don't really do it any favors.

12
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:48,303
The evocative colors in sharp contrast 
to the anime are replaced by drab dark 

13
00:00:52,721 --> 00:00:53,554
talents that are often hard to make out 
that sure animation is more likely to 

14
00:00:56,381 --> 00:01:00,070
have crispr lines of contrast,
but the live action movie not only fails

15
00:01:00,071 --> 00:01:02,260
to recreate the beauty of its 
predecessor,

16
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,660
it fails to understand the purpose of 
that.

17
00:01:04,661 --> 00:01:08,950
But take a look at these two shots.
How does each make you feel?

18
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,120
Okay.
For me,

19
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:13,350
the one on the left draws my attention 
to the bed.

20
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:16,770
It's the brightest part of an otherwise 
pretty uniformly colored frank.

21
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:17,703
If you blurt it out like this,
you can see that there is virtually no 

22
00:01:19,541 --> 00:01:20,374
contrast between the interior walls of 
the apartment and the cityscape through 

23
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,633
the window.

24
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:25,503
It makes for a blend bluish composition 
that doesn't ask you for any further 

25
00:01:28,331 --> 00:01:30,190
consideration.
Or what about this one?

26
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:31,203
Well,
the immediately recognizable difference 

27
00:01:32,361 --> 00:01:34,860
is the light source.
Instead of coming from the bed,

28
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:35,733
the light comes from the window and it's
blown out so much that it creates this 

29
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:42,940
frame within a frame effect that trout 
to the apartment and leaves the major in

30
00:01:42,941 --> 00:01:45,190
Silhouette.
There's great contrast here,

31
00:01:45,191 --> 00:01:47,590
but the purpose of the contrast is more 
important.

32
00:01:47,591 --> 00:01:51,190
It's almost as if the major shape is cut
out of the city itself.

33
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,203
In a video I made a couple of years ago,
I spoke about how the 1995 anamae 

34
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,190
explores the relationship between city 
and person.

35
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,730
It uses a futuristic,
pluralistic,

36
00:02:00,731 --> 00:02:01,564
dynamic Hong Kong to interrogate what it
means to build a personal identity in 

37
00:02:05,591 --> 00:02:06,424
the age of sidewalks.
It does this by visually framing 

38
00:02:08,471 --> 00:02:09,304
characters in relation to the city 
around them and by giving us time to 

39
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:14,770
contemplate the space where the story 
takes place,

40
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:15,813
most notably in a three and a half 
minute meditative sequence that allows 

41
00:02:18,161 --> 00:02:20,080
us to simply look at the city.

42
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:24,010
It's funny that the live action movie 
ads 20 more minutes of runtime,

43
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:27,220
but can't find any time for something 
like this.

44
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:30,220
In fact,
for all the cool visuals that boasts,

45
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,770
there is really no city at all in this 
movie.

46
00:02:32,771 --> 00:02:33,604
Just a digital canvas to show off.
Cyber punkish affects the way ghost in 

47
00:02:37,781 --> 00:02:40,030
the shell.
Twenty 17 one says to see the city is in

48
00:02:40,031 --> 00:02:40,864
these elaborate soaring shots that move 
and glide through the holographic 

49
00:02:44,861 --> 00:02:45,694
buildings,
but actual people don't see the city 

50
00:02:48,191 --> 00:02:51,070
that way.
One of the things that 2017 helped me to

51
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:51,904
realize is that every shot in the 
montage from the anime is from the 

52
00:02:55,151 --> 00:02:55,984
perspective of human beings.
The camera is placed only where could 

53
00:02:59,651 --> 00:03:02,950
actually stand or sit or gaze out of a 
window.

54
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:06,550
That's how you build a sense of place.
Not like this.

55
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,190
In fact,
you can learn a lot about what makes the

56
00:03:09,191 --> 00:03:12,520
anime so great by watching the live 
action ghost in the shell.

57
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,890
Let's take a look at this sequence.
For example,

58
00:03:14,891 --> 00:03:19,030
one of my favorite from the original 
story of the garbage man in the enemy.

59
00:03:19,031 --> 00:03:19,864
We get to spend three or four minutes 
with this guy and his coworker as they 

60
00:03:22,871 --> 00:03:23,704
work and chat.
He explains that his estranged wife 

61
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:26,283
won't let him see his daughter,
so he's hacking into her mind to find 

62
00:03:28,961 --> 00:03:31,720
out why she's doing this.
He even chose this colleague,

63
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,250
a picture of his daughter,
but

64
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,490
he doesn't really care.
She's my beautiful,

65
00:03:35,491 --> 00:03:38,210
precious angel.
See gannaway.

66
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:42,750
I'm not interested in crap like that.
In the 2017 version we get this.

67
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:45,190
You want me to pay for violin too?
Don't get me.

68
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:51,070
I love that 50 patients I do because 
she's amazing,

69
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:53,460
but when she practices the thing is 
painful,

70
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:56,550
right?
Why not piano?

71
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,053
That was 14 seconds.
You don't see these guys doing their 

72
00:04:00,431 --> 00:04:02,050
job.
You don't get any conversation.

73
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,153
In 14 seconds,
their minds are hacked and they become 

74
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,760
zombies.
After this,

75
00:04:06,761 --> 00:04:07,594
they staged the iconic fight scene from 
the enemy in the water in front of the 

76
00:04:10,571 --> 00:04:11,404
city.
It's virtually a shot for shot remake 

77
00:04:13,151 --> 00:04:13,984
with a few differences like these 
beautiful science versus these beige 

78
00:04:18,251 --> 00:04:19,084
buildings or this red shirt as a point 
of focus versus this beige overcoat or 

79
00:04:23,951 --> 00:04:28,150
even this little smile,
a man momentarily in awe of his city.

80
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,610
A brief moment like that can add so 
much,

81
00:04:30,611 --> 00:04:33,910
but ghost in the shell.
20 17 never has time for them.

82
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,133
Finally,
we get to the tragic moment when the 

83
00:04:36,251 --> 00:04:38,770
garbage man learns that he's been 
fooled,

84
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:42,760
that all his memories of his daughter or
fake implanted by a hacker.

85
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:46,330
The live action version shoots this in a
weird glass box with a man.

86
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:49,720
We've spent 14 seconds with cutting all 
over the place.

87
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,170
The enemy takes this moment largely in 
one shot,

88
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:56,740
garbage man in the harsh,
overexposed light of the truth.

89
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,750
The man doesn't believe it with a cop 
brings out the man's photograph and asks

90
00:05:01,751 --> 00:05:04,330
him what he sees.
I had a picture of her.

91
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:08,980
She was there.
She was smiling like an angel.

92
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:10,800
I'm sorry to put you through this.
Now.

93
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:17,250
Come on,
who do you see in the Nma?

94
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:18,123
We get this tragic little arc,
one that echos the larger themes of the 

95
00:05:21,161 --> 00:05:24,130
film and it's sequenced brilliantly 
following.

96
00:05:24,131 --> 00:05:24,964
This is the scuba diving scene where 
major ruminates on her own identity and 

97
00:05:28,571 --> 00:05:29,404
following that is the montage I 
mentioned before where we get to 

98
00:05:31,991 --> 00:05:32,824
ruminate,
where the ideas from both scenes 

99
00:05:34,151 --> 00:05:37,180
compound and reverberate across the 
city.

100
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,120
In the live action movie,
the character is a throwaway.

101
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,920
The scene is disconnected.

102
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:46,360
The scuba diving seen as isolated as 
well elsewhere in the movie at any time.

103
00:05:46,361 --> 00:05:49,060
For us to dwell on these ideas is 
nonexistent.

104
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:50,583
The worst part about it is that the 
story ghost in the shell 2017 once to 

105
00:05:53,471 --> 00:05:57,350
tell is actually really good.
It's from a part of the TV series,

106
00:05:57,351 --> 00:05:58,184
the standalone complex,
and it features the Revolutionary Qusay 

107
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,143
here played by Michael Pitt whose 
backstory is tragic and whose ideology 

108
00:06:06,351 --> 00:06:07,184
is profound.
We don't get to explore any of that 

109
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,120
because 2017 is busy trying to 
accommodate two stories.

110
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,040
There were interesting things about 
both,

111
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,113
but we get nothing but the surface level
of either those who adapt works of art 

112
00:06:22,251 --> 00:06:25,790
should be given the creative license to 
make the story work for them,

113
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:30,110
but you can't just mind the source 
material for parts,

114
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,453
adaptations and remakes,
don't require strict adherence or 

115
00:06:33,771 --> 00:06:34,604
obedience or even necessarily respect 
just an understanding of what made the 

116
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:42,770
original so powerful in the first place.

117
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,250
