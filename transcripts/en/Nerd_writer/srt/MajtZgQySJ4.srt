1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,000
Coffee on a Tuesday and blog 23 in an 
art studio.

2
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:20,951
Oh,
sorry.

3
00:00:20,951 --> 00:00:23,120
I was just checking the twitter APP on 
my iphone.

4
00:00:23,121 --> 00:00:23,590
Now.
Someone.

5
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:26,710
Someone tweeted me.
Actually that was like a minute ago.

6
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:30,310
Now I'm reading New York Times article 
about the Syrian uprising.

7
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,620
A really interesting,
a really devastating to,

8
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:36,760
but I'm actually.
That was like a minute ago to now or,

9
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:37,990
or um,
uh,

10
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:38,531
no,
no,

11
00:00:38,531 --> 00:00:40,390
that actually,
that was 20 minutes ago.

12
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:44,230
I guess you can really get lost in the 
temple.

13
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:47,260
If I was a kid,
eight to 18,

14
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,273
these last few minutes would consist 
only of a fraction of the seven and a 

15
00:00:50,651 --> 00:00:53,190
half hours a day that I spend with 
media.

16
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,380
Do I care?
Not really.

17
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,350
By which I mean of course that there was
a fat chance to them.

18
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,250
I'm going to stop doing seven and a half
hours.

19
00:01:00,251 --> 00:01:01,084
That's from a study conducted by the 
Kaiser Family Foundation in 2009 up 

20
00:01:04,211 --> 00:01:07,810
about an hour and a half from the same 
study done in 2004.

21
00:01:07,811 --> 00:01:08,644
So now in 2012,
I think it's safe to say that we're 

22
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:13,870
probably pretty close to eight hours.
What's the day into nice even thirds,

23
00:01:13,871 --> 00:01:14,704
right?
Eight hours of the day we sleep eight 

24
00:01:16,331 --> 00:01:17,164
hours of the day.
We consume media like rabbit hungry 

25
00:01:19,151 --> 00:01:20,490
wolves and eight hours of the day,
week,

26
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,820
what do we do for the other eight hours 
of the day?

27
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:27,300
Yeah,
so

28
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,133
what's to be made of all this?
I don't want to criticize those who 

29
00:01:29,551 --> 00:01:32,700
spend a lot of time with media.
Clearly your relationship with media,

30
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,830
like everything else is your own thing,
your own a affair,

31
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:35,843
but I do think that there's something 
missing from the Kaiser Family 

32
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:38,830
Foundation report.
See,

33
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:42,180
today's media is social,
which means that it consists not only of

34
00:01:42,181 --> 00:01:43,014
consumption but also of expression and 
these two things are relentlessly 

35
00:01:46,651 --> 00:01:47,484
intertwine.
Whatever you consume has been expressed 

36
00:01:48,871 --> 00:01:52,470
by someone else and whatever you express
will be consumed by others.

37
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,740
There was a total awareness of this in 
social media.

38
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,770
Facebook and twitter are not journals or
diaries.

39
00:01:58,771 --> 00:01:59,604
Whatever you post on there is posted 
with your complete understanding that 

40
00:02:02,971 --> 00:02:06,510
others will see it and not only see it,
but probably will comment on it and thus

41
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,690
express themselves for your own response
of consumption,

42
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:14,310
and so a facebook status like a novel or
a Vlog is a request for judgment.

43
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:15,503
Any cereal tweeter who tells you that he
or she doesn't care what other things 

44
00:02:17,701 --> 00:02:18,534
should be left at shared expression is 
the definition of caring what others 

45
00:02:20,911 --> 00:02:21,744
think.
There's such a thing as expression for 

46
00:02:22,591 --> 00:02:24,180
its own sake,
but that's what these are for.

47
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:28,080
The point is that whatever medium of 
shared expression you choose will be the

48
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:30,300
medium by which you are asking to be 
judged.

49
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,460
If all we're getting from you in terms 
of expression,

50
00:02:32,461 --> 00:02:33,294
is curling up in bed with the salad and 
a movie until the grammy's start to 

51
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,460
finally relaxed.
Feel so nice gifts.

52
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,330
Crack was a little too wet for Whitney 
Houston.

53
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,730
She did work in on a Saturday night,
man,

54
00:02:41,731 --> 00:02:43,720
I'm to lose work,
homemade crab Rangoon,

55
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:44,803
or you have to participate relentlessly 
in the manifestations of your own 

56
00:02:46,561 --> 00:02:48,180
blessings.
What?

57
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,043
Don't be surprised if you're treated 
equally as simple equally as trey 

58
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,470
equally as idiotic.

59
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,633
We should never forget or forgo the 
understanding that expression from a 

60
00:02:56,221 --> 00:02:59,980
conversation to a feature film is always
difficult to do.

61
00:02:59,981 --> 00:03:03,700
It well requires a measure of 
composition of time and a willingness to

62
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:05,410
improve.
Despite frustrations.

63
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,590
Your social media personality is not 
you.

64
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:11,410
It's a performance review and maybe for 
yourself.

65
00:03:11,411 --> 00:03:13,600
It's easy not to confuse that 
difference,

66
00:03:13,601 --> 00:03:14,434
but it's not so easy for all those who 
see only this performance and who are 

67
00:03:17,021 --> 00:03:17,854
disposed in many ways to treat others as
stereotypical as they can and maybe 

68
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:25,090
sometimes you get frustrated feeling 
that others don't understand.

69
00:03:25,091 --> 00:03:27,220
You don't see your respect,
what you want.

70
00:03:27,221 --> 00:03:28,054
Maybe you feel like you're always coming
out of conversations or arguments with 

71
00:03:30,731 --> 00:03:33,580
your point poorly made well,
I'll let you in on a secret.

72
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:34,743
Those who can speak well to the point 
and with lucidity practice these people 

73
00:03:37,991 --> 00:03:40,000
trip up like everyone else,
but less often.

74
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,833
More Times than not,
they make their point and come out of 

75
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,473
even in normal conversation,
feeling like you have a better 

76
00:03:45,521 --> 00:03:48,250
understanding of what they want and who 
they are.

77
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:49,893
Not everyone is or has to be an artist 
that everyone has to write a novel or 

78
00:03:52,421 --> 00:03:53,254
make an album,
but there is something to be said for a 

79
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:57,400
little bit of reserve when it comes to 
expression.

80
00:03:57,401 --> 00:03:59,950
That way you can preserve some of your 
own mystery,

81
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:03,010
some of your own subtlety.
You can escape some unnecessary judgment

82
00:04:03,011 --> 00:04:06,130
and you can recover the power of your 
own voice.

83
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:09,010
Oh,
sorry.

84
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:12,910
Just getting a tweet.
What could she possibly be painting?

85
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:19,863
Cut.
