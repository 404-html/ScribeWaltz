00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:15,140
Good friends at gibbons wrote of ancient
Rome that the devout polytheists,

2
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:17,460
though finally attached to his national 
rights,

3
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,660
admitted with implicit faith,
the different religions of the earth,

4
00:00:21,661 --> 00:00:22,890
fear,
gratitude,

5
00:00:22,891 --> 00:00:25,130
and curiosity,
a dream or an omen,

6
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:25,973
the singular disorder or a distant 
journey perpetually disposed him to 

7
00:00:30,061 --> 00:00:34,530
multiply the articles of his belief and 
to enlarge the list of his protectors.

8
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:38,310
Holly theism is a chaotic and 
historically beautiful condition.

9
00:00:38,311 --> 00:00:39,144
It's not so hard to imagine our 
forefathers of antiquity devoid as they 

10
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:46,050
were of explanations for earthquakes or 
debilitating diseases stars.

11
00:00:46,051 --> 00:00:46,884
It's not so hard to imagine them 
assigning these mysterious forces a 

12
00:00:49,981 --> 00:00:51,360
percentage,
a deity,

13
00:00:51,361 --> 00:00:52,194
of what else distinctly human shape and 
character whose job it was to oversee 

14
00:00:56,551 --> 00:00:57,384
this or that sphere of existence.
This way of thinking is called 

15
00:00:59,761 --> 00:01:00,594
[inaudible],
in which the world and its forces are 

16
00:01:02,281 --> 00:01:03,114
described by stories of holy origin.
When the mythical man wants to explain 

17
00:01:06,211 --> 00:01:09,270
the universe,
he does it based on God's and powers,

18
00:01:09,271 --> 00:01:12,420
and if he is a more elegant thinker in 
fiction and allegory,

19
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:17,510
the worldview of mythos and polytheism 
is necessarily disordered and archaic.

20
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:18,444
There need be no unifying principle to 
connect things because the universe as 

21
00:01:21,961 --> 00:01:22,794
such is at the caprices of these gods 
and goddesses who to read the poetry 

22
00:01:26,431 --> 00:01:29,340
about them agree about as much as we 
human story.

23
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,540
No.
Now there's

24
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:36,600
one institution that can exist in a 
world dominated exclusively by Mythos,

25
00:01:36,601 --> 00:01:39,690
and that is the institution of science.
Why?

26
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,553
Well,
because we know that the foundational 

27
00:01:41,761 --> 00:01:44,880
principle of science is the principle of
no contradiction.

28
00:01:44,881 --> 00:01:45,714
In other words,
it's scientific theory is only valid 

29
00:01:47,371 --> 00:01:51,780
until a contradiction is found.
In which case set theory must be revised

30
00:01:51,781 --> 00:01:52,614
or scrapped.
Nothing in polytheism resembles this 

31
00:01:55,861 --> 00:01:56,694
kind of logic.
Contradiction in mythos is totally 

32
00:01:59,191 --> 00:02:00,050
acceptable,
so we're.

33
00:02:00,051 --> 00:02:00,884
Does science come from well,
this is perhaps the greatest irony of 

34
00:02:03,211 --> 00:02:06,690
all science proceeds historically from 
monotheism,

35
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,000
a belief system held originally by the 
Jews,

36
00:02:09,001 --> 00:02:12,210
that there was one all powerful God from
who's massive.

37
00:02:12,211 --> 00:02:13,044
Mine comes.
The uniform ordered universe makes 

38
00:02:15,661 --> 00:02:16,471
sense,
doesn't it?

39
00:02:16,471 --> 00:02:17,304
For Science to work,
it must assume that the universe is 

40
00:02:19,321 --> 00:02:23,400
organized by a unifying principle and 
idea that doesn't appear until the early

41
00:02:23,401 --> 00:02:24,234
sixth century BC when exiled Jews in 
Babylon begin the process of redacting 

42
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,333
the many texts of the Hebrew tradition 
into what became the old testament was 

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,630
failing as a pre socratic Malaysian 
philosopher of the same era who saw that

44
00:02:36,631 --> 00:02:37,464
such a reduction,
the singular texts and the singular God 

45
00:02:39,961 --> 00:02:43,080
it described suggested the principle of 
no contradiction.

46
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,913
If God created a universe,
then it had to be ordered and uniform 

47
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:51,150
and so in the person of families and the
subsequent socratic thinkers,

48
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:55,440
the famous transitioned from myths.
Those two logos takes place.

49
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:58,350
Logos is a way of explanation 
concentrated around argument,

50
00:02:58,410 --> 00:02:59,243
what aristotle later formalizes as logic
in which an or can be brought around to 

51
00:03:03,251 --> 00:03:04,084
the other side of a logical disputes 
simply by being shown the contradiction 

52
00:03:07,241 --> 00:03:08,074
in his argument.
It's humbling to know the close causal 

53
00:03:10,301 --> 00:03:13,600
historical connection between monotheism
and modern science.

54
00:03:13,601 --> 00:03:16,990
That connection modern scientists are 
low dimension.

55
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:21,250
The truth is that science is as firmly 
rooted in belief as religion.

56
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:25,660
It cannot work without the assumption 
that the universe is ordered and follows

57
00:03:25,661 --> 00:03:28,330
the rule of no contradiction like 
science says it does.

58
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,740
Now,
as a postscript,

59
00:03:29,741 --> 00:03:33,100
you may be asking yourself,
does this mean that religion is as valid

60
00:03:33,101 --> 00:03:37,090
and epistemological system as sciences?
They are both based on belief.

61
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,140
Well,
there is a very simple answer for that.

62
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:41,583
No

63
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:48,890
city.
The city.
