1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:01,613
Dude,

2
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:10,290
favorite conversation among film Geeks 
is which Wes Anderson movie is the best.

3
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:11,853
I love this conversation because there's
so much to love about all of them and 

4
00:00:14,891 --> 00:00:15,724
you can't really argue with somebody who
picks rushmore or the royal tannenbaums 

5
00:00:18,761 --> 00:00:22,510
where the Grand Budapest hotel,
so really the conversation is less about

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,630
competition and more about how one 
particular movie in this director,

7
00:00:26,631 --> 00:00:29,620
his filmography affected someone 
personally.

8
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,633
How one particular angle of Anderson's 
vision hit that person squarely in the 

9
00:00:34,571 --> 00:00:39,571
face because of where or when or who 
they were at that moment in their lives.

10
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:41,613
For me,
that film is the Darjeeling limited the 

11
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:47,170
story about three brothers on a 
spiritual journey through India.

12
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,280
The brother who brings them together.
Francis says the journey is about trust,

13
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:55,630
but it's really about communication.
How after a year of not speaking and the

14
00:00:55,631 --> 00:00:56,464
lifetime of upper middle class anxiety,
their ability to talk with each other 

15
00:00:59,831 --> 00:01:00,664
coherently has completely broken down.
The first conversation they have on the 

16
00:01:03,401 --> 00:01:05,140
train tells you everything you need to 
know.

17
00:01:05,141 --> 00:01:05,974
It plays like some hilarious group chat 
where one or all three of the brothers 

18
00:01:09,701 --> 00:01:10,260
has terrible

19
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,330
well cell service and struggles to keep 
up the last two.

20
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,500
You want to read a short story I wrote 
in France.

21
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,333
I think everybody knows that close 
friends and especially family don't 

22
00:01:37,011 --> 00:01:39,620
always answer the questions that you ask
them,

23
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,493
the answer,
the question that they think your 

24
00:01:41,751 --> 00:01:42,584
question implies.
They try to anticipate where you're 

25
00:01:44,091 --> 00:01:46,910
going at its best.
This makes for a wonderful shorthand,

26
00:01:46,911 --> 00:01:50,120
but at it's worst,
assumptions like these can be incredibly

27
00:01:50,121 --> 00:01:50,954
frustrating and make for stilted 
communication that never hits its mark 

28
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:58,781
with everyone zigzagging and working at 
cross purposes in the Darjeeling Limited

29
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:03,220
Jack Francis and Peter's spend a lot of 
time communicating to themselves through

30
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,470
juggling.
Raise us.

31
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:08,483
Francis is especially guilty of this.
He organizes this bogus spiritual 

32
00:02:11,461 --> 00:02:14,880
journey to process his father's death.
Now a year past,

33
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:15,983
he thinks maybe that if he can't connect
his brothers through discovering some 

34
00:02:19,051 --> 00:02:22,920
deep profundity in India,
that the tragedy will be senseless.

35
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:26,130
After all,
we're told that pain makes us stronger,

36
00:02:26,131 --> 00:02:28,800
that it has lessons to teach.
What if it doesn't?

37
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:30,203
He's so desperate for connection that he
spends the entire movie literalized in 

38
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,340
it,
in the form of an agreement,

39
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,290
make an agreement.
Let's make another agreement.

40
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:39,600
Let's make another agree.
Let's make another agreement.

41
00:02:39,601 --> 00:02:43,110
We agreed to that and you agree to that.
We read to that can we agree to agree to

42
00:02:43,111 --> 00:02:43,944
that?
Jack and Peter Process the grief in 

43
00:02:45,781 --> 00:02:46,614
their own ways.
Jack writes a short story about the 

44
00:02:48,511 --> 00:02:50,700
funeral and he's also grieving by the 
way,

45
00:02:50,701 --> 00:02:51,534
the end of a romantic relationship,
something that's detailed in a really 

46
00:02:54,391 --> 00:02:58,020
great short film that Precedes 
Darjeeling called Hotel Shivali aid with

47
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,913
Natalie Portman.

48
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,093
The brothers seemed to think that his 
solution to everything is to run away 

49
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:04,063
from keeping his passport,
but it's that little gift from his ex 

50
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,680
shows.
Grief is like a scent.

51
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,390
It lingers and has a deep link with 
memory runaway and it'll follow you.

52
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,780
Try to destroy it and you'll only 
unleash the aroma in a more potent form.

53
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:20,470
Jesus,
Peter,

54
00:03:20,471 --> 00:03:21,304
I think who takes the tragedy hardest.
Not only is he the angriest of the 

55
00:03:24,341 --> 00:03:25,174
three,
but his entire life has become 

56
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,273
distorted.
His caring wife is weeks away from 

57
00:03:28,961 --> 00:03:31,750
having their first child and he's in 
India.

58
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:36,190
He appropriates his father's belongings,
namely his prescription sunglasses which

59
00:03:36,191 --> 00:03:39,180
make the world unfocused in the world.
Tenenbaums.

60
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,053
Richie hides behind giant sunglasses so 
that the world can't see him in 

61
00:03:43,451 --> 00:03:44,284
darjeeling.
Jack wears prescription sunglasses so 

62
00:03:46,481 --> 00:03:47,314
that he can't see the world.
I think that communication has been at 

63
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:53,050
the heart of West Anderson style from 
the start.

64
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,273
It might be that he has similar 
anxieties to Francis and need to ensure 

65
00:03:57,551 --> 00:03:58,384
that a message given has been received.
This is one way to read all his 90 and 

66
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,143
180 degree quick pants in the same way 
that Francis asks for an agreement for 

67
00:04:06,731 --> 00:04:07,564
everything.
Anderson takes the coolest chava effect 

68
00:04:09,611 --> 00:04:13,510
where viewers derive meaning from the 
relationship between two shots perfected

69
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:14,663
I hitchcock and fills in all the missing
information showing how those two or 

70
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:21,580
three or four compositions are 
connected.

71
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:22,443
Of course,
West Anderson loves to match personal 

72
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,024
crises with visual motifs,
and he doesn't shy away from obvious 

73
00:04:28,331 --> 00:04:31,810
ones either like brothers,
unwilling to feel real trauma,

74
00:04:31,811 --> 00:04:36,340
all having some form of painkiller 
symbols of failed communication can come

75
00:04:36,341 --> 00:04:37,174
in the form of a dropped bag.
A command shouted that no one in 

76
00:04:40,301 --> 00:04:43,660
particular,
a soft whisper before sex,

77
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,870
a sense of moving forward,
but not getting anywhere.

78
00:04:46,871 --> 00:04:50,110
It can be a train that gets lost,
lost sunrail.

79
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:54,010
Jack's tendency to turn his life into 
the perfect fiction can be made physical

80
00:04:54,011 --> 00:04:54,844
in the form of an ipod.
Speaker in this too is likely a 

81
00:04:57,071 --> 00:04:59,830
personality trait that Anderson shares.
I mean,

82
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:02,770
how is this any different from this?

83
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:17,660
I don't necessarily think the darjeeling
limited is the formal peak of Anderson's

84
00:05:17,661 --> 00:05:18,494
work,
but I think that it's the most human of 

85
00:05:20,481 --> 00:05:21,314
his films.
Since the ensemble is limited mostly to 

86
00:05:23,451 --> 00:05:24,284
three people,
we get a deeper dive into each 

87
00:05:26,241 --> 00:05:30,110
personality and much more importantly 
into the web that makes them,

88
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:34,610
in many ways a single organism.
One of my favorite things about the film

89
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:39,110
and not so obvious visual flourish is 
the design of the train compartment,

90
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:44,180
namely these two equally sized panels on
both sides of the interior wall.

91
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,660
One is a mirror and the other is an 
internal window,

92
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,660
but of course it's hard to tell those 
two things apart.

93
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:51,733
Francis,
Jack and Peter are constantly throwing 

94
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:54,613
barbs at one another,
feeling out the contours of own 

95
00:05:57,291 --> 00:06:00,050
identities.
Sometimes they hit the target.

96
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,810
Other times it's reflected back.
Mostly.

97
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,033
It's both.
I guess that's the point about 

98
00:06:05,841 --> 00:06:09,980
communication.
You can't help speaking to yourself when

99
00:06:09,981 --> 00:06:10,814
you speak to others.
Others can't help hearing something 

100
00:06:13,431 --> 00:06:17,730
about themselves even when they know 
that you're projecting onto them.

101
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,250
Strange.

102
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:28,570
The Darjeeling limited is my favorite 
wes Anderson movie.

103
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:29,423
It came out when I was just starting 
college trying to find my identity in 

104
00:06:33,001 --> 00:06:36,060
others and it hit me square in the face 
and yeah,

105
00:06:36,061 --> 00:06:39,330
I do think it's the best for now,
but that's not definitive.

106
00:06:39,331 --> 00:06:40,164
It's just the opening salvo in a 
conversation between me and everybody 

107
00:06:43,951 --> 00:06:46,680
who watches this channel.
A bunch of film Geeks,

108
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:49,020
so what do you think?

109
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:56,300
Hey everybody.
Thanks for watching.

110
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,790
I had been waiting for ever to do a 
video on West Anderson.

111
00:06:58,791 --> 00:06:59,624
This was so much fun and me and my 
friends really do have these 

112
00:07:01,311 --> 00:07:04,850
conversations all the time about which 
we think is the best and I love all.

113
00:07:04,851 --> 00:07:08,020
I love moonrise kingdom and I love life 
aquatic and,

114
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,820
and they're also good.
But uh,

115
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:10,663
you know,
everybody's got their favorite for one 

116
00:07:11,481 --> 00:07:12,740
reason or another.
This is mine.

117
00:07:12,741 --> 00:07:13,574
What's yours?

120
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:24,340
Thank you so much for watching.
I'll see you all next Wednesday.
