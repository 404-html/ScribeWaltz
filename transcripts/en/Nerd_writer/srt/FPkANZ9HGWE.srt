1
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,320
Commonly reported symptoms of clinical 
depression is a warped sense.

2
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:27,020
Everything can feel like it's moving in 
super slow motion.

3
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:28,423
In fact,
depression warps everything around it 

4
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:35,270
like a star warped spacetime that only 
your sense of duration,

5
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,760
but also your sense of yourself and 
others.

6
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:41,300
Your mental life is thrown out of all 
proportion.

7
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,190
In his film,
Melancholia,

8
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:44,053
Lars von Trier uses skewed proportions 
to communicate a feeling that he's 

9
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,710
intimately familiar with.
You know,

10
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,553
when I ride,
I can only write about myself and this 

11
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:58,280
is more or less a description of my,
my own depression.

12
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,593
The very first scene after the slow 
motion montage that speaking of warp 

13
00:01:02,601 --> 00:01:03,434
time shows both the end of the film and 
the end of world is the newly married 

14
00:01:07,821 --> 00:01:08,654
Justine and Michael trying to get from 
the ceremony to the reception in a 

15
00:01:12,891 --> 00:01:13,724
stretch limo that is almost comically 
too large for the country road that 

16
00:01:16,911 --> 00:01:17,744
they're driving.
Eventually they have to abandon the car 

17
00:01:20,091 --> 00:01:20,924
and walk,
and by the time they get to the castle 

18
00:01:22,401 --> 00:01:23,234
where the reception is,
half of the night has already been 

19
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:25,683
wasted.

20
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:31,880
What's interesting is that the viewer 
doesn't really feel that lightness.

21
00:01:31,881 --> 00:01:32,714
We're only at the beginning of the film 
and this I think gives us a hint of the 

22
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:39,200
weird,
almost dreamlike temporal quality of the

23
00:01:39,201 --> 00:01:40,034
wedding reception to come.
One thing that keeps getting stranger 

24
00:01:42,471 --> 00:01:47,120
and stranger to me as I rewatched the 
film is the relationship between Justine

25
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,013
and Michael.
I mean at times it almost seems as if 

26
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:51,163
they don't even know each other.
Michael seems to be completely unaware 

27
00:01:53,721 --> 00:01:54,554
of the severity of Justine's depression 
and there are a few shots where Michael 

28
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:00,650
just stares off blankly like a kind of 
dead puppet.

29
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:01,550
Here.
Again,

30
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:05,150
things are skewed.
Volunteer doesn't give us a sense of the

31
00:02:05,151 --> 00:02:08,330
couple's past,
but I'm getting ahead of myself.

32
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:12,410
The first half of the film is made up of
the wedding reception,

33
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,273
alternating between the party and 
justine's various exits as she falls 

34
00:02:17,301 --> 00:02:18,134
deeper and deeper into an oncoming bout 
of depression inventory or uses the 

35
00:02:21,861 --> 00:02:25,970
reception itself to set up an 
expectation of continuous time,

36
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:28,760
but Justin's exits make this 
problematic.

37
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,790
The two parts of the sequence don't seem
to fit together.

38
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:35,060
Justine rides off in a golf cart all the
way across the ground.

39
00:02:35,061 --> 00:02:38,750
She languishes in a bath,
but the party is always there,

40
00:02:38,751 --> 00:02:39,584
always still happening when she returns 
to it in moods that are increasingly 

41
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:46,640
detached,
even within the party time jumps forward

42
00:02:46,641 --> 00:02:48,890
at the whim of volunteers,
disorienting editing,

43
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:52,340
the film critic Marta grow.
It's drew my attention to the fact that,

44
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:53,443
for example,
the newlyweds first dance is actually a 

45
00:02:55,161 --> 00:02:59,770
montage of justine dancing with a number
of people while the song underneath it,

46
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:00,783
La Bomba plays continuously.
What all of this adds up to is an 

47
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:05,284
unsettling feeling of subjectivity,
of feeling that you're in the head of 

48
00:03:08,891 --> 00:03:12,460
justine and by extension,
volunteer who's attempts to get a handle

49
00:03:12,461 --> 00:03:16,210
on things to lock everything in place 
are upset,

50
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:17,303
and then finally dashed.
No one in the film seems capable of 

51
00:03:19,811 --> 00:03:20,644
measuring things correctly,
whether it's the number of beans in a 

52
00:03:23,561 --> 00:03:25,660
jar,
2,000,006

53
00:03:25,661 --> 00:03:26,494
piece,
or the correct trajectory of a rope 

54
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:29,584
planet.

55
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,600
Everything that's handled,
Burns,

56
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:32,463
creases or shatters,
and we ought to mention the several 

57
00:03:35,741 --> 00:03:38,200
artistic references volunteer makes in 
the film,

58
00:03:38,201 --> 00:03:40,510
many of which are in the very first 
sequence.

59
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:45,010
The most obvious is this shot,
which sites John Everett Malays Painting

60
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,470
Ofelia after the character in 
Shakespeare's hamlet,

61
00:03:47,471 --> 00:03:51,190
who is perhaps the most famous 
depressive in all of literature.

62
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:54,010
Then we have an actual shot of Roy 
goals,

63
00:03:54,011 --> 00:03:54,844
hunters in the snow,
a painting of hunters coming back to 

64
00:03:56,801 --> 00:03:57,634
their village empty handed,
which calls to mine another science 

65
00:04:00,161 --> 00:04:02,740
fiction film concerned with the depths 
of the soul.

66
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,753
Andre Tarkovsky is Solaris.
The volunteer is a massive fan of 

67
00:04:07,181 --> 00:04:10,180
Tarkovsky and there are other 
similarities here to sell.

68
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,170
Ours,
for example,

69
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,070
makes great use of box coral prelude in 
f minor,

70
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:17,590
repeating it throughout the film and as 
he's written,

71
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:21,040
Tarkovsky likes to use music as a 
reframe.

72
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,240
The refrain brings us back to our first 
experience of entering the poetic world,

73
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:26,283
making it immediate,
and at the same time renewing it 

74
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,493
voluntary or uses the same technique in 
Melancholia with wagner is a prelude to 

75
00:04:33,191 --> 00:04:34,024
Tristan and his old,
a romantic song that speaks to how the 

76
00:04:36,341 --> 00:04:40,160
filmmaker mixes his meditation on 
depression with beauty,

77
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:42,950
like a glowing blue planet and desire.

78
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:46,280
And there are plenty of other references
to like those to elaine.

79
00:04:46,281 --> 00:04:49,820
Rene's last year at Mary and bought 
another film with a dream like narrative

80
00:04:49,821 --> 00:04:50,654
structure,
and of course these early shots jump 

81
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:53,624
forward to reference,
but not exactly replicate later moments 

82
00:04:56,991 --> 00:04:57,824
in the film.
Melancholia is no doubt a polarizing 

83
00:05:00,981 --> 00:05:02,840
film.
It's beauty is undeniable,

84
00:05:02,841 --> 00:05:07,340
but I'm sure many will argue that it 
lacks coherence or focus and need.

85
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,740
I have my own problems with the second 
part of the film,

86
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,633
but this is one of the most striking 
portrayals to me of a disease that 

87
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:16,543
affects so many,
but which is still so little understood 

88
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,073
in my view.
Depression is what happens when your 

89
00:05:23,451 --> 00:05:24,284
identity,
that sense of the relationship you have 

90
00:05:26,271 --> 00:05:30,500
with the world around you becomes 
untethered and focused.

91
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,800
In this process,
everything starts to skew.

92
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:38,330
Time slows to a standstill.
Your body wants so easy to move.

93
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,180
It feels like it weighs a ton for a 
person.

94
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:45,110
Memories start to become disorganized.
The memories of a film,

95
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:49,280
on the other hand are all those works of
art that informed and proceeded.

96
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:53,330
Perhaps this is why Vaughan tree or 
surrounds his characters with so many.

97
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:56,630
By the time we get to the second half of
the film,

98
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:00,200
extraordinary situation,
the approach of the rogue planet,

99
00:06:00,201 --> 00:06:01,700
Melancholia,
warps,

100
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:02,563
even the characters dispositions,
justine emerging slowly from the depths 

101
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:10,990
of her illness reacts to the existential
situation with calm.

102
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:20,680
Claire on the other hand,
hurt seeing other half begins to panic.

103
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:25,810
The film in the end takes on the disease
of its main character.

104
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,490
I,
for one,

105
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:29,560
am happy to see a film.
So Ernest,

106
00:06:29,561 --> 00:06:30,394
about sadness as it stands,
science and medicine have come up short 

107
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,073
in their apprehension of mental illness.
So maybe we ought to look to art for 

108
00:06:39,881 --> 00:06:44,881
insights and solidarity about what it's 
like living a life out of proportion.

109
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,830
Hey everybody,
thanks for watching.

110
00:06:51,831 --> 00:06:53,240
Sorry,
this video is a little bit late.

111
00:06:53,241 --> 00:06:56,960
I had a horrible stomach flu yesterday 
that was just destroying me.

112
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:57,933
Um,
but I feel much better now and I love 

113
00:06:59,601 --> 00:07:00,434
this film.
You know,

114
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,273
I have certain problems with it,
but I think there's so much of value 

115
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:06,200
here.
And I love the opportunity to talk about

116
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:09,590
depression and mental illness through 
the lens of a film like this.

117
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,660
Um,
so I hope you guys liked it.

118
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:12,653
Um,
if you want to play through this 

119
00:07:12,821 --> 00:07:13,654
channel,
you can go right here and pledge a 

120
00:07:14,181 --> 00:07:17,060
dollar or $3 per video on Patrion page.
Everything helps.

121
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:17,894
You guys have been amazing.
Thank you for watching my q and a last 

122
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:20,760
week.
That was a lot of final.

123
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:23,660
Definitely do more and I will see you 
guys next Wednesday.
