00:00:58,051 --> 00:01:01,350
Pennsylvania.
So I'm going to vote.

14
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,393
Get my pen out here.
Not going to show you who I'm voting 

15
00:01:03,901 --> 00:01:04,734
for.
I know you thought it was going to do 

16
00:01:05,581 --> 00:01:06,414
it,
but I'm not gonna.

17
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,690
And then we're going to deliver it to 
the mailbox.

18
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,280
Okay?
The ballot is complete.

19
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,380
Let's go deliver it to the mailbox.

20

The deed is done.

If you haven't voted yet,
you're old enough to vote.

23
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,380
Go out and get a ballot.
If you're out of the state,

24
00:01:50,381 --> 00:01:52,320

Make sure you vote.

25
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:53,363

I don't want to wait four years to do 

26
00:01:55,951 --> 00:01:57,240
that again.
Whatever.

27
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,290
It was fun while it lasted.
