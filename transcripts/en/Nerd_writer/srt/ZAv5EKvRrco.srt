1
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:03,403
What happened to post modernism,
that great intellectual movement of the 

2
00:00:07,281 --> 00:00:08,114
late 20th century,
that question all objective conceptions 

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,130
of truth.
What happened to it?

4
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:14,083
Did it end?
Most people seem to agree that yet it 

5
00:00:16,881 --> 00:00:17,714
did end,
but if you ask those same people when 

6
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:23,900
postmodernism ended,
they can't really give you an answer.

7
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:24,973
This may be due to the fact that the 
idea of postmodernism is still pretty 

8
00:00:28,641 --> 00:00:29,474
fun.
It's hard to define it except as a 

9
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:35,870
reaction to the modernism.
It was created to refute that.

10
00:00:35,871 --> 00:00:38,270
Simplest way I can describe it is like 
this.

11
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,133
Modernism was a movement at the turn of 
the 20th century dedicated to building 

12
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:46,820
coherent theories about all the new 
information science,

13
00:00:46,821 --> 00:00:49,280
philosophy and psychology or giving to 
us,

14
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:50,293
and postmodernism was the period 
directly after that in which the 

15
00:00:53,391 --> 00:00:58,391
authority of all those theories was 
challenged as well as the very notion of

16
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:00,200
authority in the first place.

17
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:05,060
Postmodernism is a good catchall for all
the various and chaotic ways of thinking

18
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,910
that characterize the later part of the 
20th century.

19
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,073
But as we neared the millennials and the
need to react to or refute modernism 

20
00:01:13,401 --> 00:01:14,234
seemed less and less relevant,
postmodernism sort of fell apart and we 

21
00:01:18,501 --> 00:01:22,040
were left with,
well nothing indeed.

22
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:22,874
One of the key characteristics of our 
time is its inability to define itself 

23
00:01:26,901 --> 00:01:29,930
with a set of intellectual ideas.
Why is this?

24
00:01:29,931 --> 00:01:32,630
Why have categories like this broken 
down?

25
00:01:32,631 --> 00:01:35,570
Why don't they seem to suit the 
contemporary age?

26
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:38,330
Is it because everything is just too 
chaotic now?

27
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:39,223
Or is it because we have too much 
information and too much access for any 

28
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:45,440
one movement to congeal and rise to 
prominence?

29
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,720
Yeah,
I think that's probably true,

30
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:51,830
but it only tells us so much.
If we dig a little bit deeper,

31
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:52,723
we can see that what's really changed is
our relationship to history as science 

32
00:01:58,011 --> 00:02:02,030
fiction author Bruce Sterling,
one set history is not a science.

33
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:06,230
History is an effort and the humanities.
What sterling means is that history,

34
00:02:06,231 --> 00:02:11,231
studying it or writing it or knowing it 
has always been a game of meanings.

35
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:12,373
We look back in based on certain 
material facts and contemporary 

36
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,213
writings.
Try to tell a coherent story about past 

37
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:19,874
cultures and their values,
the meanings they ascribe to their time 

38
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:24,350
and existence.
Now,

39
00:02:24,351 --> 00:02:27,730
modernism and postmodernism had 
something in common there.

40
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:32,210
Access to history was enabled by paper,
by books,

41
00:02:32,211 --> 00:02:36,830
books with covers and bindings,
but more importantly with beginnings,

42
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:37,723
middles and ends.
Modernists and postmodernists thinkers 

43
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:43,280
had to resort to books.
They had no other choice.

44
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,263
They learned the authoritative sources 
on a given subject either to accept or 

45
00:02:47,871 --> 00:02:48,704
refute them and by responding to the 
tradition they themselves became a part 

46
00:02:53,151 --> 00:02:55,460
of it,
but these are different times.

47
00:02:55,490 --> 00:03:00,280
The book was replaced,
it was replaced with the network and the

48
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:02,980
network doesn't respect history or 
tradition.

49
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,900
Let's say you want to know something 
about,

50
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:05,943
I don't know the philosophy of stoicism.
I bet the very first thing you would do 

51
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,233
is open up a search engine,
probably Google and let a complex ever 

52
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:16,900
changing algorithm based on views,
recency,

53
00:03:16,901 --> 00:03:20,530
filters,
phrasing and much more prioritize.

54
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:25,180
A list of results within that list are 
all kinds of different and contradictory

55
00:03:25,181 --> 00:03:29,200
positions all the way from top 
university professors to some guy on his

56
00:03:29,201 --> 00:03:30,034
couch and in each article there is 
usually a common section with opinions 

57
00:03:33,341 --> 00:03:36,250
about those opinions.
Then if you can find the author's name,

58
00:03:36,251 --> 00:03:38,280
you can go back to Google and type that 
in,

59
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:39,123
see if you can somehow determine via 
their wikipedia page or number of 

60
00:03:42,221 --> 00:03:46,630
twitter followers what other people 
consider the level of their authenticity

61
00:03:46,631 --> 00:03:48,490
to be,
or you can just go to youtube,

62
00:03:48,491 --> 00:03:52,510
which I often do and see if someone's 
made a video about stoicism.

63
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:56,470
That's a little bit easier to digest.
In the network culture.

64
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,560
Everything is fluid,
poorly organized,

65
00:03:59,561 --> 00:04:02,860
but extremely persuasive.
Narratives accumulate,

66
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,040
alter and change as quickly as Google's 
algorithm does and we have access to all

67
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:12,520
of them instantaneously.
Sterling and fellow author,

68
00:04:12,521 --> 00:04:16,810
William Gibson name this unnameable 
transition period of culture.

69
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,123
A temporality in which we have this 
great unmooring from historical 

70
00:04:21,881 --> 00:04:24,970
knowledge just makes for a lot of unease
and our time,

71
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,190
the maps we have,
the network,

72
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,083
the Internet,
and all its social function can't seem 

73
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:31,773
to do its job.
It can't map a strong master narrative 

74
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,500
onto the world we see in front of us 
now,

75
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:41,440
maybe someday it will.
Sterling gives it 10 years,

76
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,310
but it won't look like any of the master
narratives from literary culture.

77
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,263
Really we have no idea what a master 
narrative in network culture could look 

78
00:04:51,671 --> 00:04:52,211
like.
Now.

79
00:04:52,211 --> 00:04:53,044
It's easy to see that such a disruptive 
break from the past also means and 

80
00:04:57,791 --> 00:05:01,870
uncertainty about the future,
about what progress looks like,

81
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,170
a lack of confidence in the market in 
nation states,

82
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:06,004
in groups of nation states like the EU 
and the belief that democracy can be 

83
00:05:09,431 --> 00:05:13,330
exported around the globe are all 
symptomatic of this.

84
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,140
A temporal transition period in the 
world and in the arts.

85
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:21,760
What you get is this collaging of past 
and future in the present,

86
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,950
the repurposing of old structures and 
obsessions with predicted futures of the

87
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:28,810
past.
That never came about.

88
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:30,970
I mean,
what's more out of time,

89
00:05:30,971 --> 00:05:33,730
for example,
then stuff like steam punk.

90
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:38,050
It's tempting to see this new historical
situation as a problem,

91
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:43,530
but you can look at it as an opportunity
to why not take up the whirling elements

92
00:05:43,991 --> 00:05:48,991
of the past and the future and design 
the contemporary moment that you want to

93
00:05:49,781 --> 00:05:50,614
see in art,
in your personal life or in the public 

94
00:05:53,021 --> 00:05:53,854
space.
Then maybe the highbrow philosophy of 

95
00:05:55,361 --> 00:05:56,194
the future can't be canonized.
Maybe there never will be another 

96
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:00,613
Charles Dickens or George Orwell,
but there's a great freedom in losing 

97
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:04,183
the Canon as well as sterling notes.
Historians really used to worry that 

98
00:06:08,421 --> 00:06:12,980
their interpretations of the past were 
clouded by their own values.

99
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:16,430
Maybe the good news is that for us right
now,

100
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:21,170
we just don't know what our values 
really are so that whether we're looking

101
00:06:21,171 --> 00:06:22,004
back or looking forward,
the a temporal age and the a temporal 

102
00:06:25,851 --> 00:06:29,690
person can finally see with clear eyes.

103
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,223
I want to thank everybody so much.
Who is pledged to the channel on 

104
00:06:34,451 --> 00:06:36,460
Patrion.
You're really making this possible.

105
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:37,323
You know,
I do this full time now and I've had 

106
00:06:38,921 --> 00:06:43,921
such a great time focusing all my energy
and effort on making I hope really,

107
00:06:44,621 --> 00:06:47,320
really great content for you and there's
a lot more coming up.

108
00:06:47,321 --> 00:06:48,154
So if you haven't already,
I want to ask you please to pledge to 

109
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:53,020
the nerd writer on Patrion as little as 
$1 per video.

110
00:06:53,021 --> 00:06:54,190
Everything helps.
I mean,

111
00:06:54,191 --> 00:06:56,080
if a bunch of people do $1,
it adds up.

112
00:06:56,081 --> 00:06:58,240
So don't be afraid to do a little if you
only have a little.

113
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,313
Thank you so much.
I'm going to keep bringing stuff to you 

114
00:07:00,941 --> 00:07:03,700
next Wednesday and if you want to check 
out my last understanding art,

115
00:07:03,701 --> 00:07:06,400
which is a poetry analysis,
click around here.

116
00:07:06,401 --> 00:07:08,880
It's about later and the swan by WB 
yeats,

117
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,840
one of my favorite poems ever.
And I love that video.

118
00:07:10,841 --> 00:07:11,730
So,
um,

119
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,810
thank you so much again and I'll see you
next time.
