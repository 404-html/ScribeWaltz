1
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:03,613
First Grade,
Scifi cover artist was frank or Paul 

2
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:10,510
discovered by the father of science 
fiction publisher Hugo Gernsback.

3
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:11,344
In 1914,
Paul define the imagery that came to be 

4
00:00:13,991 --> 00:00:18,100
associated with Scifi tails is covers,
have amazing stories.

5
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:21,070
The first magazine devoted solely to 
this new genre,

6
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:23,980
features,
spectacular spaceships and spacemen,

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,020
giant insects,
laser guns,

8
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:30,010
and a lot of really odd looking aliens 
in those years.

9
00:00:30,011 --> 00:00:30,844
The middle 19 twenties.
These covers were probably among the 

10
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:37,990
strangest art that the average American 
ever got to see on news stands,

11
00:00:37,991 --> 00:00:38,824
these colorful garish nightmare visions 
and leaped into the imaginations of 

12
00:00:42,881 --> 00:00:43,714
young readers.
Paul is such a towering figure in 

13
00:00:45,561 --> 00:00:46,394
science fiction because so many 
influential writers and artists in the 

14
00:00:49,071 --> 00:00:50,870
field,
not to mention readers,

15
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:51,763
can trace their obsession with the genre
to the unforgettable experience of 

16
00:00:55,311 --> 00:00:58,640
seeing his covers for the first time.
The purpose of a book cover,

17
00:00:58,820 --> 00:00:59,653
of course,
is to draw you in to peak your interest 

18
00:01:01,551 --> 00:01:04,910
enough to read the story behind it,
but on these covers,

19
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:09,800
paul launched a fascinating genre of 
painting and design that rarely gets the

20
00:01:09,801 --> 00:01:10,634
attention it deserves in the same way 
that science fiction and fantasy as 

21
00:01:14,481 --> 00:01:18,360
genres historically didn't get the 
attention that they deserved.

22
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:20,510
Interestingly,
one of the byproducts,

23
00:01:20,511 --> 00:01:21,344
I think of this lack of attention was 
that the cover art for these books got 

24
00:01:24,111 --> 00:01:24,944
to explore weirder and more avant garde 
artistic styles than they would have 

25
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:29,504
otherwise.
The revolution inside Fi covers came 

26
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:32,383
with a revolution and book selling.
In 1939 Robert to graph launched pocket 

27
00:01:36,891 --> 00:01:37,724
books,
the first mass market publisher of 

28
00:01:39,771 --> 00:01:43,520
paperbacks in America,
and he was hugely successful and amazing

29
00:01:43,521 --> 00:01:44,354
as it sounds.
No one really thought that people would 

30
00:01:46,161 --> 00:01:46,994
read paperbacks,
but when the pocket version of James 

31
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:52,640
Hilton's last horizon sold two and a 
half million copies,

32
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:56,870
people knew that there was a change in 
the air as marked are noted in the daily

33
00:01:56,871 --> 00:01:57,704
beast.
Suddenly the four point three by seven 

34
00:01:59,451 --> 00:02:00,284
inch format of mass market paperbacks 
became the canvas for cover artists and 

35
00:02:04,821 --> 00:02:07,820
with more scifi selling and with the 
genre getting more of it.

36
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:08,930
Stu,
culturally,

37
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:13,520
publishers look to artists who could 
reflect the deep themes that the story's

38
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,473
explored.

39
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:17,630
Take Penguin the British bookseller in 
the forties and fifties.

40
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:21,500
They were known for their classic orange
and white covers then in the sixties,

41
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:24,950
in an effort to raise the sophistication
of their science fiction offering.

42
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,720
Art Director Germano facility started 
pairing novels with covers featuring the

43
00:02:29,721 --> 00:02:32,990
work of popular modern artists.
For example,

44
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:33,853
James publishes a case of conscience 
takes place on the planet with organic 

45
00:02:37,581 --> 00:02:41,570
almost biological shape.
Buildings for the cover for steady chose

46
00:02:41,571 --> 00:02:44,180
a detail from data estin,
surrealist painter,

47
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:46,700
Max Ernst,
the eye of silence,

48
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,593
or Jg Ballard,
the drowned world of post apocalyptic 

49
00:02:50,061 --> 00:02:53,690
novel set in Oblique,
flooded uninhabitable London for this,

50
00:02:53,691 --> 00:02:54,524
for Seti,
chose Eve 10 surreal landscape of 

51
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:00,370
battered shapes and odd configurations 
called the Palace of windowed rocks.

52
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,263
After for Seti,
a series of art directors through the 

53
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:06,700
sixties and seventies commissioned 
original works or did it themselves.

54
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:07,803
There was Allen Aldridge who created a 
series of beautiful psychedelic images 

55
00:03:11,471 --> 00:03:13,450
over black in the late 19 sixties.

56
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,553
There was Franco Greg [inaudible],
who pioneered methods of experimental 

57
00:03:16,841 --> 00:03:21,841
photography resulting in a monochromatic
kaleidoscopic images in 1970.

58
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,200
Then there was David Pelham who made 
this iconic cover for a clockwork orange

59
00:03:26,201 --> 00:03:27,034
in 1972 and these gorgeous reprints of 
the Ballard classics a few years later 

60
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:32,883
over at ballantine books.
It was Richard powers who is really 

61
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:36,124
pushing the limits of the form.
The ballantine's essentially gained 

62
00:03:38,531 --> 00:03:39,364
powers,
free reign to pull from all his 

63
00:03:40,991 --> 00:03:41,824
modernists and surrealist influences,
sometimes pulling completely away from 

64
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:46,893
the actual content of the book.
The result was hundreds of covers that 

65
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:53,770
could have easily filled gallery spaces 
and modern art museums,

66
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:56,680
and while they were increasingly 
abstract powers,

67
00:03:56,681 --> 00:03:59,710
covers mind the subconscious in the 
surreal,

68
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:00,873
in the same way that the best science 
fiction does the present a world that's 

69
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:07,690
warped often in radical ways as a 
reaction to the world.

70
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:12,810
That is one of the things I love about 
Scifi cover art is how accessible it is,

71
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:15,520
like literally accessible.

72
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:16,383
You can walk into any used bookstore 
anywhere and get five of these old pulp 

73
00:04:19,191 --> 00:04:20,024
books for a dollar each.
I can own a vincent defeat and a Bob 

74
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:28,390
Pepper and Ian Miller's insane cover for
Bradbury's long after midnight,

75
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,240
and then the art is with you.
It's in your home.

76
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:33,820
As you read the stories,
it's on your bedside table.

77
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,820
It's art you hold with your hands.
It's not precious.

78
00:04:36,821 --> 00:04:40,960
It's been folded and creased and above 
all,

79
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,213
it's weird.
Scifi and fantasy covers had the chance 

80
00:04:44,801 --> 00:04:45,634
to be weird,
not only because of the weird things 

81
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:50,140
going on in the stories,
but because the genre was categorized as

82
00:04:50,141 --> 00:04:53,890
pope and weird imagery sort of came with
the territory.

83
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,113
There are hundreds of artists and 
thousands upon thousands of books in 

84
00:04:57,551 --> 00:04:59,890
this tradition.
I can't possibly cover it all here,

85
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,190
partly because a good amount of it is 
forgotten.

86
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,220
Hiding away in crates at the back of 
bookstores.

87
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:10,090
Next time you're at one,
pull some of those crates out and see if

88
00:05:10,091 --> 00:05:10,924
you can't find a last chapter in this 
eclectic and underappreciated sub genre 

89
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:16,893
of art history.

90
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:20,883
Everybody,
thank you so much for watching and 

91
00:05:22,001 --> 00:05:24,880
indulging me in this passion I have for 
Scifi book covers.

92
00:05:24,881 --> 00:05:26,350
I've been wanting to do this video for a
while,

93
00:05:26,351 --> 00:05:28,630
so I'm really,
really glad that I finally did it.

94
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,500
This episode was brought to you by VRV.
If you don't know,

95
00:05:32,501 --> 00:05:33,334
Vrv is a service that pulls together a 
lot of great content channels like 

96
00:05:36,281 --> 00:05:37,810
rooster teeth,
Mondo,

97
00:05:37,811 --> 00:05:41,260
crunchy roll,
and funimation all into one place so you

98
00:05:41,261 --> 00:05:42,094
can watch some of the best anime there,
but they've also added a lot of new 

99
00:05:45,131 --> 00:05:49,330
channels like movie which hosts a 
rotating roster of 30 indie movies.

100
00:05:49,331 --> 00:05:52,120
Something that I really love.
One other show that I personally like to

101
00:05:52,121 --> 00:05:52,954
point out is the director's chair where 
director Robert Rodriguez interview 

102
00:05:55,531 --> 00:05:57,470
interviews.
Other directors like Coppola,

103
00:05:57,471 --> 00:05:59,630
George Miller,
Guillermo del Toro.

104
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,140
I'm also Gary and his demons is a really
funny enemy.

105
00:06:03,141 --> 00:06:06,020
If you're into kind of like rick and 
Morty and that style of humor,

106
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,810
you can only watch those shows with vrv
