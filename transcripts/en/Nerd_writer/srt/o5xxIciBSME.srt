1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:04,980
Apple Needs Samsung,
let me put that another way.

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:10,380
Apple needs someone to manufacture the 
oled screens on it's brand new,

3
00:00:10,381 --> 00:00:14,000
flagship smartphone,
the iphone 10 and Samsung.

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,150
It's biggest smartphone competitor is 
the only company that can do it.

5
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:19,213
If you're wondering how Samsung stock 
price could look like this in a year 

6
00:00:21,631 --> 00:00:22,464
when the company had to replace them,
fully recall and exploding phone in a 

7
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:26,843
year when it's defacto.
Chief Executive was sentenced to five 

8
00:00:28,501 --> 00:00:30,720
years in jail for bribery and 
embezzlement.

9
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:31,973
This is how most people know Samsung as 
the company that sells them smartphones 

10
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,350
and tvs,
even refrigerators,

11
00:00:37,351 --> 00:00:41,820
but the strongest part of its business 
is actually the components it builds for

12
00:00:41,821 --> 00:00:42,654
other companies,
namely memory chips and displays like 

13
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:49,250
the old display that's going into the 
iphone 10 in these two key divisions.

14
00:00:49,251 --> 00:00:50,084
Samsung has the ability to supply 
products quickly to meet a Gargantuan 

15
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:54,263
worldwide demand.
The name of the game is market share 

16
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:59,520
that they of course supply their own 
devices with these components,

17
00:00:59,521 --> 00:01:03,810
but they want everyone else to turn to 
them too and they're investing heavily,

18
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:04,823
almost $19,000,000,000
on new plants in the next four years to 

19
00:01:07,441 --> 00:01:09,150
grab a bigger slice of that pie.

20
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,313
In July of this year,
Samsung overtook Intel as the world's 

21
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:13,493
number one chip maker and their 
dominance and owlette is even more 

22
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:18,210
extreme.
As of the beginning of 2017,

23
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:21,210
Samsung had over 90 percent of the 
market share,

24
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,253
basically a monopoly,
which means when demand for Olin grows 

25
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,500
like it has with the iphone.
Samsung groves to apple,

26
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,393
you might guess hates the situation 
because Samsung is the only old lead 

27
00:01:31,971 --> 00:01:35,160
maker in the world who can handle the 
demand for new iphones.

28
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,100
Samsung gets to set the price for 
reference.

29
00:01:38,101 --> 00:01:43,101
Kgi Securities estimates that Samsung 
will charge apple around 120 to $130 for

30
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,513
each oled screen compared to old lcd 
screens which only cost apple about 45 

31
00:01:48,991 --> 00:01:53,070
to $55 and this may be a contributor to 
the hefty $1,000

32
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,810
price tag on the iphone 10.
This sort of thing has to,

33
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:58,800
especially Tim Cook,
Apple Ceo Cooks,

34
00:01:58,801 --> 00:01:59,634
expertise is in supply chain in the 
process of how products get made and 

35
00:02:02,971 --> 00:02:06,210
distributed to customers and when he 
joined apple in 1998,

36
00:02:06,211 --> 00:02:07,044
he was instrumental in overhauling the 
supply chain and making it the most 

37
00:02:10,081 --> 00:02:11,730
efficient in the world.

38
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:12,803
One of the ways apple does this is by 
outsourcing pretty much all of its 

39
00:02:15,061 --> 00:02:18,870
production to suppliers mostly in Asia 
who compete for their business,

40
00:02:18,871 --> 00:02:22,290
but in the case of oled screens,
apple has no other choice but to go with

41
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:23,124
Samsung.
Apple wanted 80 million oled screens 

42
00:02:25,081 --> 00:02:28,530
just for the second half of 2017.
No one else can do that.

43
00:02:28,531 --> 00:02:29,364
Samsung barely has the capacity,
which is one of the reasons why the 

44
00:02:31,201 --> 00:02:32,034
iphone 10 comes out six weeks later than
the iphone eight in order to bring its 

45
00:02:35,521 --> 00:02:36,354
own lead costs down.
Apple needs for there to be a serious 

46
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:39,024
competitor in this space,
which is why it's investing two point 

47
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:44,040
$7,000,000,000
in LG display.

48
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:48,330
Basically a massive cash advance for 
them to build up their capacity.

49
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:49,463
Google has the same idea.
It's investing $880 million dollars in 

50
00:02:51,991 --> 00:02:55,200
to lg to break the Samsung monopoly for 
the near future,

51
00:02:55,201 --> 00:02:56,034
though it doesn't quite matter,
Samsung is likely to be the major 

52
00:02:58,471 --> 00:03:02,170
beneficiary of apple's lead needs,
at least through 2019.

53
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:05,430
Not to mention that we'll also be making
a huge number of theories.

54
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,303
Chips for apple to know.
It's one of the strangest relationships 

55
00:03:08,651 --> 00:03:09,484
in business.
Apple and Samsung have been feuding for 

56
00:03:12,131 --> 00:03:16,450
years ever since 2010 when Samsung 
essentially copied the iphone with their

57
00:03:16,451 --> 00:03:17,284
galaxy s smartphone.
The two companies have been locked in 

58
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:24,580
illegal war for almost seven years.
That has cost Samsung $150,

59
00:03:24,581 --> 00:03:27,490
million dollars and maybe more.
In the end,

60
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,383
it seems silly because apple is still 
shelling out millions upon millions to 

61
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:37,000
its archrival for parts bolstering 
Samsung's huge profits and its growth.

62
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:37,863
The iphone x is sort of the perfect 
symbol for the whole messy relationship 

63
00:03:41,561 --> 00:03:45,760
and it captures how the tech business 
works at the very highest level.

64
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:49,330
It's dysfunctional marriages like this.
Apple Needs Samsung.

65
00:03:49,331 --> 00:03:50,164
Yeah,
but Samsung is certainly profiting from 

66
00:03:51,941 --> 00:03:53,740
the business.
In other words,

67
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:57,580
these two mega companies really need 
each other.

68
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,060
Everybody.
