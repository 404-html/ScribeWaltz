1
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,633
Batman historian,
we'll brooker one set the defining 

2
00:00:19,281 --> 00:00:24,281
characteristic of Gotham city must be 
there was always correct

3
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:33,030
night and day.
He has only increased police forces,

4
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,880
helpless to cope with the situation,
but they have an ally.

5
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:37,043
Man.

6
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:42,410
There has to be crime in Gotham because 
Batman is on one key level,

7
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:43,573
the one who fights crime.
This highlights the inseparable 

8
00:00:46,911 --> 00:00:47,744
connection between Batman and his city.
It's actually more like a circular 

9
00:00:51,231 --> 00:00:55,400
connection and that one is always 
creating and perpetuating the other.

10
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:56,293
It was Gotham city that killed Bruce 
Wayne's parents in the form of a petty 

11
00:00:59,691 --> 00:01:00,524
thief that it's corrupt.
Conditions created sending in motion a 

12
00:01:03,351 --> 00:01:04,184
chain of events that led to the Batman's
obsessive mission to rid them of crime 

13
00:01:08,211 --> 00:01:12,860
and obsession that fostered a darker and
more twisted criminality.

14
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,550
I'm an agent of chaos.
In the beginning,

15
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:19,260
Gotham was just a backdrop,
a setting,

16
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,140
and deep.
It wasn't even Gotham.

17
00:01:21,141 --> 00:01:21,974
It was New York City until detective 
comics number 48 in the 1943 and 49 

18
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:29,240
television serial's of Batman.
Most of the action,

19
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:33,640
largely due to budgets takes place in 
interiors on sound stages.

20
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:36,770
Little attempt is made to signify Gotham
as a whole.

21
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:40,520
The same is true for the Adam West 
Batman series in the 19 sixties when the

22
00:01:40,521 --> 00:01:41,354
character was at the height of camp 
scrub through the entire feature length 

23
00:01:44,241 --> 00:01:48,740
movie from 1966 and you won't see so 
much as a skyscraper.

24
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,143
When the Adam West show failed,
Batman writers brought a darker tone to 

25
00:01:53,751 --> 00:01:54,584
the stories.
They brought an extended continuity and 

26
00:01:56,571 --> 00:01:57,404
continuity meant that individual 
locations in Gotham gained importance 

27
00:02:01,101 --> 00:02:04,760
and the city itself started to breathe 
as a character.

28
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:05,623
This run of dark comics culminated in 
1986 with Frank Miller's dark knight 

29
00:02:10,011 --> 00:02:10,844
returns,
which plumbed the obsessive tortured 

30
00:02:13,281 --> 00:02:14,114
psyche of the Batman and found a 
counterpoint to that troubled mind in 

31
00:02:17,511 --> 00:02:20,660
the diseased crime ridden streets of 
Gotham.

32
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:25,280
That essential feeling was intensified 
even more and three years later,

33
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:26,383
Gotham city became a nightmare in what 
has become the most iconic imagining of 

34
00:02:33,501 --> 00:02:34,334
the caped crusaders home.
Tim Burton and Anton first fashioned to 

35
00:02:37,701 --> 00:02:38,534
city as if hell burst through the 
pavement and grew drawing from a number 

36
00:02:42,441 --> 00:02:47,441
of garishly juxtaposed architectural 
styles and the charcoal drawings of Hugh

37
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:47,900
Ferris.

38
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:48,733
The creators of 1990 nines,
Batman took the eighties fears of 

39
00:02:52,401 --> 00:02:56,510
worsening crime and augmented them to a 
kafkaesque love.

40
00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:01,660
That aesthetic was made more grand and 
in Burton's sequel Batman returns,

41
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:06,010
and three years later,
a batman forever depicted at Gotham that

42
00:03:06,011 --> 00:03:07,780
was flashier,
colorful,

43
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,500
somehow even more removed from reality.
Finally,

44
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,393
what was mccobb and genuinely inspired 
in Burton's imagination became Gadi and 

45
00:03:17,711 --> 00:03:18,544
genuinely ridiculous in 1997 fourth 
installment in the series Batman and 

46
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,760
Robin as monkey business,
and yet as the movie's soured,

47
00:03:27,761 --> 00:03:30,910
Burton's vision of Gotham television and
comics,

48
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:31,744
we're taking all the best parts of the 
1989 aesthetic and developing a deeper 

49
00:03:35,771 --> 00:03:38,620
identity for the city and the Stellar 
Batman,

50
00:03:38,621 --> 00:03:42,190
the animated series.
Gotham city is all dark deco,

51
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,233
as if the 19 thirties world's fair had 
gone on for another 60 years in the 

52
00:03:46,991 --> 00:03:50,320
comics,
Batman was more low than ever to leave.

53
00:03:50,321 --> 00:03:51,154
Gotham and Gotham itself became more 
isolated and separated from the rest of 

54
00:03:54,491 --> 00:03:55,180
the world.

55
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,013
And the famous art called no man's land.
The national government chooses to 

56
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:03,520
abandoned Gotham entirely after the city
is almost destroyed by an earthquake.

57
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:07,960
The island quickly carved up by gangs 
and villains becomes a hell on earth.

58
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:12,340
Christopher Nolan made a similar 
isolating move in Batman begins when the

59
00:04:12,341 --> 00:04:13,174
police raised the bridges to stop escape
criminals from fleeing the city and 

60
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,670
again in the dark,
knight rises,

61
00:04:18,671 --> 00:04:19,504
when Bain destroys those bridges.
Of course Nolan's Gotham is decidedly 

62
00:04:23,951 --> 00:04:27,100
more grounded and realistic than its 
predecessors,

63
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,510
especially in the Dark Knight Burton's 
Gotham may be more nightmarish,

64
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,353
but a Gotham that resembles our own 
world can be even more terrifying when 

65
00:04:36,281 --> 00:04:37,114
it's shown to be fragile in the face of 
a violent disregard for the established 

66
00:04:41,351 --> 00:04:42,184
order from its earliest onscreen 
depictions in the 19 forties to the 

67
00:04:46,301 --> 00:04:47,134
latest in a series of gruesome video 
games and a network tv show that bears 

68
00:04:50,831 --> 00:04:51,664
its name.

69
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:56,850
Gotham has been flexible to account for 
a changing world and a changing Batman.

70
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,023
The one constant is crying and 
irrepressible criminal underclass that 

71
00:05:03,821 --> 00:05:04,654
plagues the streets with whom the police
are either in league or powerless to 

72
00:05:08,771 --> 00:05:10,060
stop.
Indeed,

73
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:10,983
the Batman is by definition unable to 
stop this scourge to or else his 

74
00:05:15,341 --> 00:05:18,700
existence would be unjustified.
You defending a city,

75
00:05:18,701 --> 00:05:19,534
so corrupt,
we have infiltrated every level of its 

76
00:05:21,971 --> 00:05:23,410
infrastructure.
Gotham,

77
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:24,303
I think is totally unique in the history
of cities real or imagined existing for 

78
00:05:29,771 --> 00:05:30,604
more than 70 years.
We have an exhaustive knowledge of it's 

79
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:34,743
attitude of its field of places.
They're like Wayne Tower or Arkham 

80
00:05:38,831 --> 00:05:40,270
asylum on crime,
Allie,

81
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:42,003
yet unlike a real city,
we can't map it out in the traditional 

82
00:05:45,161 --> 00:05:50,161
sense and every attempt to do so is 
subject to change in sort of absurd.

83
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:51,993
Gotham is a city that's performed.
We know it by the stories that happened 

84
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:00,740
there by the spaces generated from 
encounters in the night.

85
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,900
In this view,
it's many versions.

86
00:06:02,901 --> 00:06:03,734
Don't register as inconsistencies would 
cohere into perhaps a new way to think 

87
00:06:08,931 --> 00:06:13,931
of cities as a site of constant 
reinvention and varied interpretation as

88
00:06:14,151 --> 00:06:19,151
an expression of the traumas that are 
reenacted by those who have suffered and

89
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:23,450
as a place that can't be mapped by its 
buildings and streets,

90
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:28,780
but by the events and people and minds 
that make them

91
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,420
everybody,
and thanks for watching.

92
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:37,283
If you think this is the kind of content

youtube or the Internet,
you can pledge to my channel by clicking

94

right here,
going to my Patrion,

95
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:49,680
giving as little as a dollar per video.
This is a full time job made possible by

96
00:06:49,681 --> 00:06:50,600
you guys,
you know,

97
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:54,750
these take like 40 or 50 hours to make.
I work like nine or 10 hours a day doing

98
00:06:54,751 --> 00:06:55,584
these and I'm having so much fun and I 
think the quality of the content has 

99
00:06:59,251 --> 00:07:00,084
gotten better since I've gone full time 
and there's still a lot more stuff I 

100
00:07:02,551 --> 00:07:05,670
want to experiment with and do.
And that's all made possible by you.

101
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,080
Um,
so thanks again.

102
00:07:07,081 --> 00:07:09,180
There are still some stickers left.
Nerdwriter stickers.

103
00:07:09,181 --> 00:07:12,300
$3 a video you can pledge there.
Get them there.

104
00:07:12,301 --> 00:07:13,500
Um,
yeah.

105
00:07:13,501 --> 00:07:16,220
Thanks a lot.
This Batman video is so much fun to me.
