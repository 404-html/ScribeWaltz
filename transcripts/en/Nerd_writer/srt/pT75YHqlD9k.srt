1
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,330
Big Movies,
genres have life cycles,

2
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,550
they're born,
they become popular,

3
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,210
they exhaust themselves,
and then if they're important enough,

4
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,520
they transform.
Hugh Jackman,

5
00:00:23,521 --> 00:00:28,521
17 year tenure as wolverine.
I think bookends to important milestones

6
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:29,453
in the superhero film.
Sean to thousands x men directed by 

7
00:00:31,981 --> 00:00:32,814
Brian Singer was effectively the start 
of the superhero craze that's come to 

8
00:00:36,151 --> 00:00:36,984
dominate Hollywood for nearly two 
decades and now 2017 slogan directed by 

9
00:00:41,011 --> 00:00:45,270
James Mangled represents a response to 
the public's exhaustion.

10
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:46,163
Would that dominance,
if you want to understand how genres 

11
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:49,733
change the writer to look at is 
definitely John Qlt who's famous essay 

12
00:00:53,431 --> 00:00:54,264
on generic transformation is I think a 
good rubric for what's happening in 

13
00:00:56,911 --> 00:00:57,744
Logan go wealthy is basically interested
in what occurs when genre conventions 

14
00:01:00,961 --> 00:01:05,100
become so well known that the audience 
demands something new.

15
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:07,650
What forms does that change?
Take a look,

16
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:11,610
wealthy identifies for burlesque 
nostalgia,

17
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:14,460
demythologize nation,
and reaffirmation.

18
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:15,653
Burlesque is essentially a ridiculous 
exaggeration or a parody of genre 

19
00:01:18,751 --> 00:01:21,120
conventions.
To Finish Leo [inaudible] quote from the

20
00:01:21,121 --> 00:01:23,760
start of this video,
genres turned to self parody to say,

21
00:01:23,761 --> 00:01:24,594
well,
at least if we can make fun of it for 

22
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:28,440
being infant tile,
that will show how far we've come.

23
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:32,460
Mel Brooks is of course a master at this
kind of thing and not just for Westerns.

24
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,353
Moments of burlesque can be found in 
serious movies too when a trope is made 

25
00:01:36,361 --> 00:01:37,194
to suddenly look ridiculous,
undercutting the fantasy with reality 

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,833
and the superhero genre.
Deadpool film that helped pave the way 

27
00:01:43,171 --> 00:01:46,020
for logan is a burlesque through and 
through

28
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:46,863
superhero landing.
So you're going to do a superhero 

29
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,150
ladder.
You wait for it.

30
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:55,760
Superhero landing,
yeah,

31
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:58,040
that's really hard on your knees,
totally impractical.

32
00:01:58,041 --> 00:01:58,874
They all do it.

33
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,380
Nostalgic films,
the ones that are good anyway,

34
00:02:01,381 --> 00:02:04,020
do more than evoke a romanticized 
passed.

35
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,123
They update,
tried and true storylines with 

36
00:02:06,721 --> 00:02:07,554
contemporary elements.
They make the audience aware of the 

37
00:02:09,691 --> 00:02:13,350
relationship between past and present 
qlt sites,

38
00:02:13,351 --> 00:02:15,090
true grit,
but Shane Blacks Kiss,

39
00:02:15,091 --> 00:02:15,750
kiss,
Bang,

40
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,710
Bang,
fits the bill as well.

41
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,420
A hard boiled detective story in which 
many of the tropes are d romanticized,

42
00:02:21,421 --> 00:02:25,650
but the story ultimately follows the 
same beats of discovery and heroism.

43
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,610
Hold on demythologize films,
so the most complex of the bunch.

44
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,473
They subject popular myths and 
conventions to a reality that undercuts 

45
00:02:33,961 --> 00:02:36,980
and exposes them as inadequate or even 
harmful weld.

46
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:39,310
These archetypal example of this is 
Roman Polanski,

47
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,193
Chinatown,
a film that follows the hard boiled 

48
00:02:41,821 --> 00:02:45,480
detective genre of classic films like 
the Maltese Falcon or the big sleep.

49
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,840
Until events become so dark and twisted 
and devoid of moral content that justice

50
00:02:50,851 --> 00:02:51,840
has never served in.

51
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,540
The detective is left severely 
traumatized,

52
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,940
and another movie like this would be the
Cohen brothers.

53
00:02:56,941 --> 00:03:00,130
No country for old men in which the law 
of the new West,

54
00:03:00,131 --> 00:03:03,160
Tommy Lee Jones not only fails to 
capture the villain,

55
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,353
but fails to understand him.
I don't want to post bond chips for and 

56
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:11,950
go out and meet something I don't 
understand.

57
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:16,330
The final transformation is the 
reaffirmation of myth,

58
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,900
that kind of film that subverts genre 
like the Dean mythologize film,

59
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:24,340
but in the end chooses to reaffirm the 
myth not as something that's real,

60
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,860
but it's something that we need to 
believe.

61
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:29,980
I wonder if you could think of a 
superhero film that might fall into that

62
00:03:29,981 --> 00:03:33,580
category,
so what is Logan?

63
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,660
Clearly it represents some shift in this
extraordinarily popular genre.

64
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:38,643
If deadpool signals a self awareness 
that the myth of the superhero movie is 

65
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:42,514
losing a bit of it's power,
then I think Logan is an attempt to 

66
00:03:44,681 --> 00:03:45,514
interrogate the contours of that myth in
order to see if there are any 

67
00:03:47,951 --> 00:03:50,320
interesting directions left for it to 
go.

68
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,333
Director James Mangold is a movie buff 
and something that's really interesting 

69
00:03:53,771 --> 00:03:58,771
about logan is how he uses one genre to 
understand another mangled states.

70
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:02,500
Logan's key theme via a scene from 
Shane,

71
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,800
one of the most popular,
and it claimed Westerns of all time.

72
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:07,030
Matt has to be what it is.

73
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:11,570
Kept breaking.
I tried it.

74
00:04:11,571 --> 00:04:16,571
It didn't work for me.
Joy,

75
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:23,160
there's no living with.
There's no going back.

76
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:27,480
Westerns are really the perfect genre to
measure the superhero movie.

77
00:04:27,481 --> 00:04:28,314
The Myth of the superhero is in many 
ways a reincarnation of the myth of the 

78
00:04:31,621 --> 00:04:32,454
gunslinger.
Both are heroes who act outside the law 

79
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:35,483
to protect the community at large,
mangled makes these parallels explicit 

80
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:41,100
in a sequence midway through the movie 
when Logan,

81
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:41,963
Charles,
and Laura are taken in by a kindly 

82
00:04:43,831 --> 00:04:47,010
family,
the same way that Shane is taken in both

83
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,873
logan and Shane help the family with 
work and protect them from greedy 

84
00:04:50,881 --> 00:04:51,714
business interests,
but those shane is somewhat haunted by 

85
00:04:54,331 --> 00:04:55,164
his life is a gunslinger.
His purpose and the code of laws he 

86
00:04:57,781 --> 00:05:01,050
lives by is still necessary to protect 
the community.

87
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:02,880
In the end.
In mangolds version,

88
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:06,720
the violence that follows the hero can't
be contained far from the valley.

89
00:05:06,721 --> 00:05:10,200
Being saved.
Logan's kindly family is mercilessly and

90
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:12,840
utterly destroyed,
and if the point wasn't clear,

91
00:05:12,841 --> 00:05:15,690
it's by none other than a clone of Logan
himself.

92
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,690
This is the closest that logan comes to 
demythologize.

93
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,093
The whole movie is a meditation on the 
violence that all superhero films imply 

94
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,253
by earning an r rating,
mangled and Jackman get to show a type 

95
00:05:27,481 --> 00:05:28,314
of visceral brutality that complicates 
the heroics of Logan's past as well as 

96
00:05:32,101 --> 00:05:35,880
those of the x men and all superheroes 
like it does.

97
00:05:35,881 --> 00:05:40,500
Shane Logan holds up the romanticized 
past of previous superhero movies in the

98
00:05:40,501 --> 00:05:42,990
form of comic books.
You do know they're all bullshit,

99
00:05:42,991 --> 00:05:43,824
right?
Maybe a quarter of it happened and not 

100
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,713
let this.
Logan is attempting to expose the 

101
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:49,374
inadequacy of these fantasies,
trying to show that no personal moral 

102
00:05:51,901 --> 00:05:54,840
code can wield power without risking 
devastation.

103
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,860
This was made painfully clear in the 
character Xavier,

104
00:05:57,861 --> 00:06:01,910
who's aging mind it's implied,
may have unintentionally killed a number

105
00:06:01,911 --> 00:06:02,744
of innocent mutants for Logan himself.
The past exploits of heroism from the 

106
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:08,670
other movies,
reemergence as trauma,

107
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:12,320
nightmares,
and the touching scene with Laura.

108
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:15,080
Near the end,
he even admits to contemplating suicide.

109
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:16,463
Actually,
I am

110
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,460
see shooting myself.
Charles said in the end,

111
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,280
Logan makes the final turn into 
reaffirmation,

112
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:29,143
one last act of sacrificial heroics that
reaffirms the myth even after exposing 

113
00:06:33,321 --> 00:06:35,090
it as inadequate.
You know,

114
00:06:35,091 --> 00:06:38,390
it makes me wonder if this is the limit 
of superhero movies.

115
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:39,493
It's unclear whether a film that sought 
to fully demythologize this myth could 

116
00:06:42,261 --> 00:06:43,094
ever really get made or if the genre 
itself is even mature enough to handle 

117
00:06:46,611 --> 00:06:47,750
such a thing.
In fact,

118
00:06:47,751 --> 00:06:51,350
I think Logan leaves us with these exact
questions.

119
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,273
The movie itself is a conversation 
between nostalgia for the genre and are 

120
00:06:55,551 --> 00:06:58,880
increasing frustration with its limits.
More than anything,

121
00:06:58,910 --> 00:06:59,743
I'm just excited for what's to come 
because it's transition periods like 

122
00:07:03,081 --> 00:07:05,180
these,
as qlt might say,

123
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:07,300
when the really interesting thing.

124
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,330
Hey everybody,
