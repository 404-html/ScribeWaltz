00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:03,450
Coffee on Tuesday and blog for,

2
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:15,263
do they want to talk about the peaceful 
protests currently happening in Lower 

3
00:00:17,071 --> 00:00:17,904
Manhattan called Occupy Wall Street.
It's starting to get some buzz in the 

4
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:24,600
mainstream media,
which I watched obsessively and also the

5
00:00:24,601 --> 00:00:27,960
rosy eyes of Michael Moore,
so you know it's legitimate.

6
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,610
So occupy Wall Street is a leaderless 
protests with a vague set of demands.

7
00:00:31,611 --> 00:00:34,440
It started by Canadian activist group 
called ad busters and the names,

8
00:00:34,441 --> 00:00:37,320
the model of the protest from Tahrir 
Square in Egypt last March,

9
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:38,363
which unseated their President Mubarak.
The Tahrir Square protest had a simple 

10
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:46,200
but intense demand move.
Bark must resign.

11
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:49,200
The protest in Liberty Park is crowded 
with lots of littler,

12
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,093
less forceful demand.
Some of the come to protest 

13
00:00:51,361 --> 00:00:52,560
unemployment,
some protests,

14
00:00:52,561 --> 00:00:54,750
the wealth inequality in this country,
some of the wars,

15
00:00:54,751 --> 00:00:56,970
some of the corruption of campaign 
finance laws,

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,833
some environmental issues,
and some of them just to create a 

17
00:00:59,761 --> 00:01:00,594
spectacle despite their demands.
Presumably everybody is angry at the 

18
00:01:03,331 --> 00:01:04,020
same thing.

19
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:04,853
The reckless abandoned perpetrated on 
Wall Street which caused the subprime 

20
00:01:07,471 --> 00:01:08,304
mortgage crisis in 2008.
Maybe we should take a minute to 

21
00:01:10,321 --> 00:01:12,990
understand the financial crisis.
One Minute,

22
00:01:12,991 --> 00:01:13,824
so Wall Street started bundling home 
loans together and selling slices of 

23
00:01:15,661 --> 00:01:18,000
those loans to investors.
Investors were making big money,

24
00:01:18,001 --> 00:01:19,290
so they started pushing the lender 
saying,

25
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:20,700
we need more loans.
Lenders,

26
00:01:20,701 --> 00:01:22,200
we're already giving people loans with 
good credit,

27
00:01:22,201 --> 00:01:23,034
so they started lowering their criteria 
used to be you needed a credit score of 

28
00:01:25,261 --> 00:01:26,094
six,
20 and a down payment of 20 percent and 

29
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:30,030
they'll settle for a 500 credit score 
and no money down.

30
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,690
Joe Schmo buyer assumes that at the 
bank's willing to lend him money that he

31
00:01:33,691 --> 00:01:36,270
must be able to afford it.
He buys his dream house banks.

32
00:01:36,271 --> 00:01:38,370
New Securities based on bad mortgages 
were risky.

33
00:01:38,371 --> 00:01:41,790
So to control potential fallout,
they started buying insurance mortgages.

34
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:44,220
Default,
the insurance company pays default swap,

35
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,410
so the banks have potential losses.

36
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,550
In short,
the risk moves off their books.

37
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,300
They invest more.
One insurance company took on more swaps

38
00:01:51,301 --> 00:01:53,580
than any other American international 
group.

39
00:01:53,581 --> 00:01:56,090
Why did they do this?
Feeds premiums millions.

40
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,890
How'd you think of the housing market?
We keep going up,

41
00:01:58,891 --> 00:02:01,530
but then all of a sudden the housing 
prices go down.

42
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,200
Joe Schmo buyer bought his dream house 
at a teaser rate mortgage.

43
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:06,150
Now that rate goes away,
payments go up.

44
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,040
He defaults mortgage back securities 
tank.

45
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:10,500
Aig has to pay off the swaps,
all of them at the same time,

46
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,090
all over the world.
They can't afford it,

47
00:02:12,091 --> 00:02:13,650
of course,
so the government does this.

48
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:21,420
The government under treasury secretary 
Hank Paulson,

49
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,110
passes the emergency economic 
stabilization act through which they can

50
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:25,944
purchase troubled assets and inject 
capital into the banks from a fund 

51
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,570
called the troubled asset relief 
program,

52
00:02:30,571 --> 00:02:32,790
which holds a cool $700,
billion.

53
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:33,893
Now,
the quick legislation did prevent a 

54
00:02:35,371 --> 00:02:36,204
catastrophe,
but it didn't stop people from losing 

55
00:02:37,231 --> 00:02:38,064
confidence.
It didn't stop people from holding onto 

56
00:02:39,211 --> 00:02:40,044
their money.
It didn't stop them from not consuming 

57
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,960
the goods and services of this economy.
So demand goes down.

58
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:46,823
The economy contracts,
businesses stop hiring and three years 

59
00:02:49,981 --> 00:02:50,814
later,

60
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,333
not enough,

61
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:11,570
I think Wilson said this on Charlie rose
in 2008 constituents were angry and they

62
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:15,594
had a right to be angry.
They had no part in making this the 

63
00:03:18,571 --> 00:03:20,490
constituents,
that's us.

64
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,010
He had no part in making this,
but did we?

65
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:23,903
Are we guiltless?
They had no part in making this or have 

66
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,930
we as consumers pushed and pushed for 
years,

67
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:31,973
every corporation to get us the best 
deals on our goods and the best returns 

68
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:36,923
on our investments are we complicit in a
system which was driven to do anything 

69
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:44,430
to be Buffett stock value and lower its 
prices on goods,

70
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:49,820
even to the point of selling bundling 
and gambling on bad mortgages so that we

71
00:03:50,311 --> 00:03:52,090
could get tee shirts at 20th.

72
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,143
Capitalism has strengthened the part of 
our brain that our consumers and 

73
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:02,174
investors,
super capitalism has made us 

74
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:11,310
terrifically adept at thinking of 
ourselves and practicing being very,

75
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:19,090
very efficient and adept.
Consumers and investors,

76
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,023
don't get me wrong,
this is not to say that the Wall Street 

77
00:04:21,321 --> 00:04:24,470
titans are blameless,
but each of us are made up of two parts.

78
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:27,640
The part that is a consumer and the part
that is a citizen.

79
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,513
Yes,
Washington is awash with corporate 

80
00:04:30,201 --> 00:04:31,034
lobbyists,
but what are those lobbyists actually 

81
00:04:32,091 --> 00:04:32,924
doing?
Most of those lobbyists are there in 

82
00:04:35,121 --> 00:04:40,121
Washington to get a competitive 
advantage over their competitors who are

83
00:04:42,411 --> 00:04:43,244
also in Washington trying to use public 
policies to get a competitive advantage 

84
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:48,463
over their competitors.
The noise level is so high that the 

85
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:55,650
public,
you and I cannot be heard,

86
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:02,870
at least the citizen cannot be here,
the consumer and investor in us.

87
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:07,720
Here's the only voice that is being 
heard.

88
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:08,683
We're going to have to be willing to 
give up some of the benefits that the 

89
00:05:10,911 --> 00:05:11,744
consumer side of ourselves has gotten in
the last few decades and certainly it's 

90
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:15,374
important as citizens that we exercise 
our rights like the people in Liberty 

91
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:19,723
Park are doing right now,
but perhaps it's more important that as 

92
00:05:23,061 --> 00:05:26,510
Americans,
we exercise our privileges.

93
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,373
One of our privileges is to learn and 
study anything we want and do it 

94
00:05:30,261 --> 00:05:31,094
systematically.
It's important that we lead with reason 

95
00:05:32,811 --> 00:05:34,130
and not emotion.

96
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,470
People are angry and frustrated and 
worried about their jobs.

97
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:41,430
If they feel that they are not getting 
ahead and if they feel that the dice are

98
00:05:41,431 --> 00:05:45,960
loaded against them,
that somehow the economy is is fixed.

99
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,810
That government and business are in 
cahoots.

100
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:49,973
That's when you ignite the kind of 
social change that could be very 

101
00:05:53,881 --> 00:05:58,140
progressive and very reform minded,
but also could be very reactionary,

102
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,510
separate some cool articles in the 
jubilee to about this.

103
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:01,530
Thanks for listening and.
