1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,190
Animal crackers on the Tuesday and blog 
29.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,840
Ah,

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,540
so when we look at a map of the world,
we see countries,

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,330
countries divided up by very neatly 
drawn lines,

5
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,370
lines which have a nice sense of 
finality to them,

6
00:00:23,371 --> 00:00:24,204
right?
This land belongs to this country and 

7
00:00:25,591 --> 00:00:28,560
that land on the other side of this line
belongs to that one.

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,230
Of course,
we know that the geopolitical reality is

9
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:33,630
anything but as conclusive as these 
lines suggest.

10
00:00:33,631 --> 00:00:37,350
We know that there is civil fighting,
contestations of land and ownership,

11
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,850
local loyalties,
local hatreds,

12
00:00:38,851 --> 00:00:39,684
religion,
sex and factions who can and often do 

13
00:00:42,121 --> 00:00:46,320
flip their noses at straight lines drawn
in comfy rooms by foreigners.

14
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,333
At some time in the past,
we've come to use and our global 

15
00:00:49,051 --> 00:00:49,884
parlance,
the word nation state to identify these 

16
00:00:52,171 --> 00:00:53,004
places.
It's a term we don't think too much 

17
00:00:54,331 --> 00:00:55,164
about.
We use it freely without going to our 

18
00:00:56,101 --> 00:00:57,570
dictionaries,
but the truth is,

19
00:00:57,571 --> 00:01:02,250
of course that nation state as a term 
quite often fails to adequately describe

20
00:01:02,251 --> 00:01:03,990
many of these countries where,
for example,

21
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:05,940
civil war is a continuing reality.

22
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:10,290
So maybe by pulling the term apart,
we can get a better understanding of how

23
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:13,620
these two words,
nation and state can come together.

24
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:16,800
Now the state is what can be defined by 
lines on a map.

25
00:01:16,801 --> 00:01:17,634
The area over which the state central 
power called the sovereign has 

26
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:21,714
controlled the sovereign in theory,
has a monopoly on all the violence that 

27
00:01:24,931 --> 00:01:27,270
occurs in the state and on the 
international stage.

28
00:01:27,271 --> 00:01:31,020
The sovereigns voice in theory is an 
equal among other saffrons.

29
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,240
This is the basic definition of 
sovereignty,

30
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,253
equal abroad master at home.
It was John Bowden and the 16th century 

31
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:41,040
who first laid out these characteristics
in his six books of the Commonwealth.

32
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,350
Thereafter,
Beaudin and others having worked at it's

33
00:01:43,351 --> 00:01:44,184
used,
try to figure out where the source of 

34
00:01:45,631 --> 00:01:46,464
sovereignty light,
but and believed as was the custom of 

35
00:01:47,911 --> 00:01:48,744
his time,
that the sovereign then ruled by a king 

36
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:51,234
or prince was derived from God and 
political thinkers for the next two 

37
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:54,864
centuries continue to find the source of
sovereignty and divine right or in the 

38
00:01:57,811 --> 00:02:00,450
laws of nature or social contracts.

39
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:01,463
But by the end of the 18th century,
a revolutionary new idea came to the 

40
00:02:04,711 --> 00:02:05,544
fore.
It said that the source of sovereignty 

41
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:07,883
lay not in the man upstairs,
but in the many men and later women 

42
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:12,960
downstairs.
In other words,

43
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,430
the source of sovereignty was in the 
people.

44
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,313
You see it loud and clear.
In the very first line of the 

45
00:02:17,731 --> 00:02:20,580
declaration of independence,
when in the course of human events,

46
00:02:20,581 --> 00:02:24,210
it becomes necessary for one people to 
dissolve the political bands,

47
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,080
etc.
Etc.

48
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,640
OnE people.
In other words,

49
00:02:26,641 --> 00:02:27,474
one nation.
By this time the word nation had become 

50
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:33,420
synonymous with the word people.
So here you have a state which finds the

51
00:02:33,421 --> 00:02:34,254
justification for its sovereign power,
the monopoly on all the violence that 

52
00:02:37,681 --> 00:02:40,620
happens within its borders,
in the consent of the people,

53
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:43,290
the nation,
hence nation state.

54
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,200
The questiOn becomes,
how do you define a people?

55
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,423
What makes people a people?
We have a number of problematic nation 

56
00:02:50,401 --> 00:02:51,234
states in the world,
places couched in what seems like 

57
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:55,380
unceasing violence,
and to understand them,

58
00:02:55,381 --> 00:02:59,380
we must first understand how people 
develop a national identity.

59
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,030
Now,
there are a number of thIngs that groups

60
00:03:01,031 --> 00:03:03,610
can share.
A language race or religion,

61
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:07,270
but stronger than all of these is as 
John Stuart mill,

62
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:10,990
the great liberal thinker said,
and identity of political antecedents,

63
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:14,470
a possession of a national history,
a community of recollections,

64
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,423
collective pride and humiliation,
pleasure and regret connected with the 

65
00:03:18,191 --> 00:03:21,130
same incidents in the past.
A historical narrative,

66
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,053
a national memory.
This binds people closer together than 

67
00:03:24,251 --> 00:03:26,710
any other common trait.
Unfortunately,

68
00:03:26,711 --> 00:03:27,544
and as we know too well,
the many millions of people who find 

69
00:03:29,891 --> 00:03:33,340
themselves in a state very often don't 
have the same memory.

70
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,593
Narratives diverged or rewritten mixed 
with myth and fiction as the years and 

71
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:39,550
decades pile on.

72
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:43,780
All of a sudden you have one state with 
two people or three peoples,

73
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,930
and the proBlem grows.
It took 400 years and a lot of blood for

74
00:03:46,931 --> 00:03:50,890
the island of Ireland to resolve issues 
between nation and state.

75
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,060
Wasn't easy.
Catholic,

76
00:03:52,061 --> 00:03:56,380
irish and protestant irish have very 
different memories of a national history

77
00:03:56,381 --> 00:03:59,410
full of conquest and subjugation.
In 1921,

78
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:00,363
the largely catholic southern part of 
the island declared itself independent 

79
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,130
from britain.
the protestants being largely of british

80
00:04:06,131 --> 00:04:09,640
descent and who held power in the north 
had no desire to break from the uk,

81
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:14,320
so a partition was built separating the 
irish free state from north Ireland.

82
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,460
Good solution,
right?

83
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:16,413
Keep the warring factions apart.
The only problem is that the catholic 

84
00:04:19,131 --> 00:04:22,420
still in north Ireland became an ill 
treated minority.

85
00:04:22,421 --> 00:04:23,254
Here's a map showing the distribution of
catholics and protestants in northern 

86
00:04:25,841 --> 00:04:28,360
Ireland doesn't really suit straight 
lines on a map,

87
00:04:28,361 --> 00:04:28,690
does it?

88
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:29,523
Fortunately in 2007,
the irish troubles were settled 

89
00:04:31,481 --> 00:04:32,500
peacefully.
However,

90
00:04:32,501 --> 00:04:34,960
this kind of conclusion isn't really the
norm,

91
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:36,820
though there is a partition,
for example,

92
00:04:36,821 --> 00:04:37,654
on the island of Cyprus,
the northern turkish cypriots and the 

93
00:04:39,641 --> 00:04:40,474
southern greek cypriots haven't yet come
to the same conclusion because the 

94
00:04:43,961 --> 00:04:46,780
issues of nation and state there haven't
yet been resolved,

95
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:49,390
nor have they been resolved for kurdish 
muslims,

96
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:50,283
the largest single group of people in 
the world who don't have a state of 

97
00:04:52,781 --> 00:04:53,614
their own.
Now we know of course that many kurds 

98
00:04:55,301 --> 00:04:56,860
live in the northern part of Iraq,
but few,

99
00:04:56,861 --> 00:04:59,560
if any,
identify themselves as iraqi.

100
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:00,403
The example that we're perhaps most 
familiar with is that of Israel and 

101
00:05:02,801 --> 00:05:05,620
palestine.
We know the hiStory and we know how each

102
00:05:05,621 --> 00:05:08,980
party writes the narrative and who's to 
say which is right.

103
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:09,903
Just last saturday was landed and annual
day of palestinian protest for an event 

104
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:14,463
in 1976 in which the israeli government 
plan to expropriate thousands of 

105
00:05:18,221 --> 00:05:21,400
palestinian demands for security and 
settlement purposes.

106
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,110
One protester was killed,
more,

107
00:05:23,111 --> 00:05:23,944
were injured and sent to hospitals.
What are the remedies when you have to 

108
00:05:26,411 --> 00:05:30,240
peoples living in a territory to which 
both can lay claim territories which are

109
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,930
part of their history,
their family history.

110
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,180
Well,
you can have external forces come in and

111
00:05:34,181 --> 00:05:37,840
try to referee the situation,
but we've seen from firsthand experience

112
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:38,853
how imperfect such illusions can be.
How about partitions like in Ireland or 

113
00:05:42,461 --> 00:05:43,900
Cyprus?
Difficulty is.

114
00:05:43,901 --> 00:05:45,880
There's always gonna be people on both 
sides.

115
00:05:45,881 --> 00:05:49,780
We think the partition is unfair.
What about population movement?

116
00:05:49,781 --> 00:05:53,830
It kind of ethnic cleansing where one 
people has to move to another place.

117
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:56,890
It's a solution,
but an extremely painful one,

118
00:05:56,891 --> 00:05:59,510
which who are forced to move,
lose everything.

119
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,670
All of these remedies are not lightly 
taken,

120
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,760
but the sad truth is that they are often
better than the alternative,

121
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:08,510
which is endemic violence that feeds on 
itself.

122
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,583
Lessons here are feeble,
but maybe this is the most important 

123
00:06:11,661 --> 00:06:14,000
one.
Violence of this kind produces precisely

124
00:06:14,001 --> 00:06:16,760
those experiences which pass into 
history,

125
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,713
confirming,
strengthening the identity of both 

126
00:06:19,311 --> 00:06:20,144
sides.
Worse violence of this kind produces 

127
00:06:21,441 --> 00:06:23,540
people with a stake in it.
Continuing,

128
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:27,140
namely young men to whom such civil war 
becomes a way of life,

129
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:29,240
providing a source of employment,
excitement,

130
00:06:29,241 --> 00:06:30,800
adventure,
and most importantly,

131
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:33,050
purpose.
Sovereignty is a problematic thing.

132
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:35,750
It can often produce deeply depressing 
results,

133
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:38,780
but if there's one thing that we can do 
as an international community,

134
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:39,703
it's to try to understand the history 
and example of such cases to try to 

135
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,113
foresee and prevent new antagonisms 
before the violence that consumes them 

136
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,080
becomes a self generating monster.

137
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,320
Well,

138
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,160
you actually mentioned the manage to 
keep most of them in.
