1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,023
Oh,

2
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:02,830
Yay.

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:05,123
Coffee on a Tuesday in block 15.
Hello to everybody who is new speaking 

4
00:00:19,601 --> 00:00:22,090
for the 500 who were here before and 
myself.

5
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,250
Welcome to or generosity during the 
project for awesome.

6
00:00:24,251 --> 00:00:27,160
Expanded my conception of what could be 
done in this community.

7
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:32,320
And though it's not enough,
clearly I can only say thank you.

8
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:34,443
Oh,
window.

9
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:39,303
Okay,

10
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,433
so now that that's done,
I think the president wanted to say 

11
00:00:47,031 --> 00:00:47,864
something.
My fellow Americans major combat 

12
00:00:50,781 --> 00:00:52,130
operations in Iraq.
Wait,

13
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:52,471
wait,
wait,

14
00:00:52,471 --> 00:00:52,600
wait.

15
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,433
No,
no,

16
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,393
not that bright.
So as your commander in chief on behalf 

17
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:03,980
of a grateful nation,
I'm proud to finally say these two words

18
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,170
and I know your family's agree.

19
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:09,530
Welcome home.
Yes,

20
00:01:09,531 --> 00:01:10,031
yes,
yes,

21
00:01:10,031 --> 00:01:12,680
yes.
The Warner rack is over December 15th,

22
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:16,640
2011,
eight years and 270 days later,

23
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,980
but he's early as 2004.
I think the worse thing about a smart to

24
00:01:18,981 --> 00:01:21,260
most as deliberately putting your hand 
on a sizzling pam,

25
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,290
we have to be careful about simplifying 
a complex decade because it will be left

26
00:01:24,291 --> 00:01:25,124
to us nine years later to appraise this,
tell a story in a way which is loyal to 

27
00:01:28,581 --> 00:01:30,770
the truth,
but also answerable to the 4,000,

28
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:31,753
487 troops who gave their lives to it 
and the many more thousands who gave 

29
00:01:35,091 --> 00:01:37,520
their arms or their legs or their 
ability to use either,

30
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:39,050
but that I am not going to talk about 
the war proper.

31
00:01:39,051 --> 00:01:39,884
What I want to talk about is what 
happens when you burn your fingers on a 

32
00:01:42,081 --> 00:01:43,460
sizzling pan.
If it's happened to you,

33
00:01:43,461 --> 00:01:47,210
then you know that if it's a good solid 
burn that some of your skin is gonna.

34
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:48,043
Stay on that path and his troops.
Levi records a bit of our collective 

35
00:01:49,881 --> 00:01:53,270
skin which will stay in that country for
some time or roughly 16,000

36
00:01:53,271 --> 00:01:54,104
Americans still in Iraq to aid with the 
ongoing diplomatic effort there and 

37
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:57,583
effort which is primarily aimed at 
making sure we secure and alliance with 

38
00:02:00,051 --> 00:02:00,884
the young democratic government.
We worked so hard and spent so much to 

39
00:02:03,381 --> 00:02:04,214
put in place is particularly important 
because it sits on the largest oil 

40
00:02:07,071 --> 00:02:07,904
reserves in the world according to new 
seismic data and with so much 

41
00:02:10,431 --> 00:02:12,410
uncertainty in the region because of the
Arab spring.

42
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,640
Iraq remains a very strategic allies,
so the $16,000

43
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:17,180
split up like this.
2,000

44
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,940
diplomats and 14,000
civilian contractors are.

45
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,680
Those contractors are there for general 
light support.

46
00:02:21,681 --> 00:02:22,514
Everything from transportation to food 
service at mess hall and the other half 

47
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:28,100
are security contractors.
I want to talk about the ladder security

48
00:02:28,101 --> 00:02:30,380
contractors because you hear that term 
tossed around a lot,

49
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:32,690
but I think a lot of people don't really
know what it means.

50
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:33,663
I did the official name for the entity 
is private military company or PMC 

51
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:40,410
though many know them as security 
contractors or even mercenary,

52
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,900
so they don't really like that last.

53
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,950
Maybe,
maybe you

54
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,270
can see what whatever you want to call 
them.

55
00:02:52,271 --> 00:02:55,900
They are corporations that deal in the 
peripheral duties of war for profit.

56
00:02:55,901 --> 00:02:56,734
They can't engage in offensive 
operations according to the Geneva 

57
00:02:58,930 --> 00:02:59,763
Convention that they can do almost 
everything but including defensive 

58
00:03:02,231 --> 00:03:04,600
operations with a liberal use of the 
term defense.

59
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,040
They build planes,
maintain them,

60
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:06,874
even fly them in conflict zones.
They supply bodyguards for diplomatic 

61
00:03:08,811 --> 00:03:10,210
construct,
bass military camps,

62
00:03:10,211 --> 00:03:12,640
operate intelligence systems,
supply weapons and ammunition,

63
00:03:12,641 --> 00:03:14,260
and they trained soldiers.
In fact,

64
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:16,600
most security contractors are retired 
soldiers,

65
00:03:16,601 --> 00:03:17,434
men and women who come out of combat 
with a set of skills applicable nowhere 

66
00:03:20,081 --> 00:03:20,914
else,
but income that contract companies will 

67
00:03:22,151 --> 00:03:22,984
pay them generously for those skills,
often more than double what the army 

68
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:25,804
pay.
It's no skin off their back because the 

69
00:03:26,441 --> 00:03:29,770
private military industry has boomed in 
the last 10 years,

70
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,620
really ever since 1991.
When the Pentagon led,

71
00:03:32,621 --> 00:03:33,454
by then defense secretary,
Dick Cheney paid a company called Brown 

72
00:03:35,801 --> 00:03:38,050
and Root Services eight point 
$5,000,000,000

73
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:41,830
to study the use of private military 
forces with soldiers in combat zone.

74
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:44,290
Now,
brandon and services was a subsidiary of

75
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:45,124
Halliburton oil company where Cheney 
served as ceo between his time as 

76
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:49,294
defense secretary and vice president.
He's studied film that outsourcing 

77
00:03:51,701 --> 00:03:54,040
duties to private military companies was
cheap,

78
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:54,874
so after nine slash 11 when the Bush 
administration announced its war on 

79
00:03:57,011 --> 00:03:57,844
terror,
the role of pmcs was increased 

80
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:01,000
dramatically during combat operations in
Iraq.

81
00:04:01,001 --> 00:04:04,690
Tens of thousands of security contractor
supplied necessary goods and services to

82
00:04:04,691 --> 00:04:06,970
the troops as they toppled Saddam's 
regime.

83
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:09,280
And when the invasion ended and the 
occupation began,

84
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,293
contractors only grew in number.
The government was outsourcing its 

85
00:04:12,221 --> 00:04:14,650
responsibilities to the point of 
confusion.

86
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,820
April 2004 for contractors from a 
company called Blackwater were killed,

87
00:04:18,821 --> 00:04:19,654
burned,
and dragged through the streets of 

88
00:04:20,591 --> 00:04:21,424
Fallujah and central Iran.
This footage was released to the news 

89
00:04:23,381 --> 00:04:24,214
outlets and it prompted a revenge 
mission to recapture the city Operation 

90
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,800
Vigilante resolved in which 27 Americans
were killed.

91
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:33,490
One hundred 80 and surgeons and 600 
Iraqi civilians,

92
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,353
you see security contractors don't have 
access to all the tactical information 

93
00:04:36,731 --> 00:04:38,170
that the troops have,
yet still,

94
00:04:38,171 --> 00:04:40,750
they carry guns and operate within all 
the same theaters of conflict.

95
00:04:40,751 --> 00:04:41,584
They don't fall into the chain of 
command so they can leave anytime they 

96
00:04:43,571 --> 00:04:45,700
want to get multimillion dollar 
contracts with the State Department,

97
00:04:45,701 --> 00:04:46,534
but being private companies,
they don't have to provide itemized 

98
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:48,874
records of where the money is going.
Perhaps the most troubling thing of all 

99
00:04:50,621 --> 00:04:54,510
about plcs is that they don't fall under
the uniform code of military justice.

100
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,680
That lack of accountability,
that lack of oversight,

101
00:04:56,681 --> 00:04:57,514
which alarms many,
the questionable deaths of dozens of 

102
00:04:59,021 --> 00:05:01,480
Iraqis which will never be prosecuted as
the war ends.

103
00:05:01,481 --> 00:05:02,314
The contractors will stay indefinitely 
to provide security for the embassy in 

104
00:05:04,991 --> 00:05:07,680
Baghdad,
Iraq and Bosnia.

105
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:12,010
The last being a city 20 miles from the 
border of Iran and sitting on one of the

106
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:14,970
largest oil fields in the world.
Yes,

107
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,420
oil,
sexy,

108
00:05:16,421 --> 00:05:18,310
delicious,
scrumptious.

109
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:19,383
If I ran seizes,
control of it in one way or another 

110
00:05:20,411 --> 00:05:22,180
weekend,
see gas prices rise to five,

111
00:05:22,181 --> 00:05:22,900
six,
seven,

112
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:23,733
$10.
Again,

113
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:26,410
I think it's fair to say that the only 
reason we went to Iraq was for the oil,

114
00:05:26,411 --> 00:05:31,411
but there's no doubt that in large part 
and with the help of pmcs it's why we're

115
00:05:31,451 --> 00:05:32,284
staying.

116
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:45,163
No.

117
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,730
Hello everybody and welcome to the 
special ed message.

118
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,753
I got some news.
I'm going to be on the last word with 

119
00:05:53,401 --> 00:05:57,350
Lawrence O'donnell on Msnbc Thursday 
night this Thursday,

120
00:05:57,351 --> 00:05:59,720
December 22nd at 10:00
PM eastern time.

121
00:05:59,721 --> 00:06:02,330
So if you want to check it out,
I'm gonna be talking about the kind fund

122
00:06:02,331 --> 00:06:04,580
and project for awesome and the project 
for awesome video.

123
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:05,693
What I need you to do is storm John 
Green and hank green so that they know 

124
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,083
that this is happening so that I can 
know that we still have time to donate 

125
00:06:12,981 --> 00:06:13,814
because I think this could provide a 
nice big push to the project for 

126
00:06:15,981 --> 00:06:16,910
awesome.
Uh,

127
00:06:16,911 --> 00:06:17,744
and,
and,

128
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,753
and that's it.
So thank you very much for watching the 

129
00:06:20,301 --> 00:06:22,550
video and I will see you later.
