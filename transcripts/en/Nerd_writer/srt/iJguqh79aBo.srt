1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,820
So this is the last blog I'm going to be
doing in this apartment.

2
00:00:02,821 --> 00:00:03,654
I'm moving out of here next week.
So say goodbye to the beautiful brick 

3
00:00:06,151 --> 00:00:11,060
wall that I love so much.
Also coffee on a Tuesday and flogged.

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:11,933
Fifty nine.

5
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:23,210
Okay.

6
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:24,043
Nationally,
we've dealt with our share of tragedies 

7
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,130
in recent months.
Last October,

8
00:00:28,131 --> 00:00:31,700
Hurricane Sandy caused an estimated 
$71,000,000,000

9
00:00:31,701 --> 00:00:32,534
in damage to the east coast in December.
20 children were shot and killed at 

10
00:00:36,531 --> 00:00:38,660
Sandy Hook elementary in Connecticut in 
April.

11
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,673
Two bombs were set off at the Boston 
marathon and just last week a massive 

12
00:00:43,281 --> 00:00:47,930
tornado literally uprooted and Oklahoma 
town killing 24 internationally.

13
00:00:47,931 --> 00:00:48,764
There are of course,
tragedies beyond counting for some such 

14
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:52,634
tragedies are a way of life,
a daily affair for those who have 

15
00:00:55,341 --> 00:00:58,040
experienced the paint,
the residents at the Jersey shore,

16
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:58,883
the parents of the children at Newtown,
the marathon runners who trained and 

17
00:01:02,181 --> 00:01:03,014
trained and were robbed in violence of 
their triumph there opens up beneath 

18
00:01:06,291 --> 00:01:07,124
them a new basement of feeling which 
many of us cannot and hopefully we'll 

19
00:01:10,971 --> 00:01:13,280
never know,
such pain in this country,

20
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:16,940
especially in those relatively safe 
neighborhoods like the one I grew up in,

21
00:01:16,941 --> 00:01:18,440
must be alienating.

22
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,750
I've never experienced intense 
suffering,

23
00:01:20,751 --> 00:01:24,050
never seen death or had someone very 
close to me die.

24
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:28,550
So by what language could the victim 
communicate to me,

25
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:31,660
his sorrow?
What responsibility do I have to feel,

26
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,513
and what responsibility do I have to 
feel the day to day suffering for those 

27
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:41,260
in parts of the world to whom such deep 
pain is not alienating but inclusionary.

28
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:45,110
For a short time after college,
I studied philosophy and I've found that

29
00:01:45,111 --> 00:01:49,940
the more I read,
the more reading seemed insufficient.

30
00:01:49,941 --> 00:01:54,530
I was studying philosophy to figure out 
what to do and ironically,

31
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:58,070
as the concept of truth became 
increasingly murky to me,

32
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:03,370
how to act became increasingly playing,
the only thing really worth doing,

33
00:02:03,411 --> 00:02:06,140
I've found was helping other people.
Of course,

34
00:02:06,141 --> 00:02:09,920
people need help in a variety of ways.
In Stardust memories.

35
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:10,580
Woody Allen's

36
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,440
says,
excuse me,

37
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:12,693
you don't have enough to eat or 
something that becomes a major problem 

38
00:02:15,111 --> 00:02:15,944
in has become very clear cut,
but what happens if you're living in a 

39
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:18,904
more,
you know,

40
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:19,743
a more affluent society and you're lucky
enough to to not have to worry about 

41
00:02:22,571 --> 00:02:23,680
that.
Let's say you're surviving,

42
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:28,390
so then you problems become,
how can I fall in love or why can't they

43
00:02:28,391 --> 00:02:29,224
fall in love more accurately and why do 
I age and die and what meaning can my 

44
00:02:33,981 --> 00:02:37,750
life possibly have?
The issues become very complex for,

45
00:02:37,751 --> 00:02:38,584
you know,
for a guy that makes a lot of funny 

46
00:02:39,941 --> 00:02:41,910
movies,
you're kind of a depressive.

47
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:42,340
You know,

48
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:45,100
Alan is describing mazlow's hierarchy of
needs,

49
00:02:45,101 --> 00:02:45,934
a hierarchical list of our human needs 
often shown as a pyramid from our most 

50
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:54,730
fundamental to our most complex,
from our physiological needs of food and

51
00:02:54,731 --> 00:02:56,740
shelter,
to our need of safety,

52
00:02:56,741 --> 00:02:58,450
of friendship,
self esteem,

53
00:02:58,451 --> 00:03:03,320
and finally of self actualization,
our needs of creativity and morale.

54
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:04,203
The idea is that one cannot ascend the 
pyramid until the needs of lower orders 

55
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:12,730
are satisfied as a novelist and Vlogger,
as one with food,

56
00:03:12,731 --> 00:03:13,900
shelter,
safety,

57
00:03:13,901 --> 00:03:15,250
self-esteem,
friends,

58
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:20,790
I aim to treat issues of self 
actualization for myself and others.

59
00:03:20,831 --> 00:03:24,640
That's what this blog is,
but that's also a choice.

60
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:25,503
It means that my experience in its 
attempts at profundity will be holy and 

61
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:30,874
necessarily different from mine.
This is Sean Ahmed of the uncultured 

62
00:03:34,961 --> 00:03:35,794
project.
Sean withdrew from Grad School after 

63
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:40,630
hearing a speech by Dr Jeffrey Sachs 
about poverty.

64
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:45,160
He liquidated his savings and left his 
life to start a project in which he uses

65
00:03:45,161 --> 00:03:49,420
technology and the web to bring those in
need together with what they need.

66
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:50,283
Teaming up with various organizations.
Sean has provided clean water to 

67
00:03:52,871 --> 00:03:54,610
villages,
rebuilt a high school,

68
00:03:54,611 --> 00:03:55,444
destroyed by a psych loan,
provided emergency relief in multiple 

69
00:03:58,451 --> 00:03:59,284
disaster areas and helped over 10,000
children through longterm health worker 

70
00:04:03,551 --> 00:04:04,120
programs.

71
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,080
I just returned from Bangladesh where 
two major events happened.

72
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:11,320
First was the garment factory collapse,
which killed over 1000,

73
00:04:11,321 --> 00:04:12,154
100 people.
Also episodes of Muslim extremist 

74
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:15,124
violence,
uh,

75
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:18,880
which over a quarter million Muslim 
extremist congregated in the city.

76
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:20,810
There were clashes with security forces 
in many.

77
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,720
What I'm feeling right now are 
Bangladeshis,

78
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:25,990
resilience to tragedy.
And it's very hard to talk about this in

79
00:04:25,991 --> 00:04:26,824
a way that doesn't romanticize the poor 
or those suffering because in many 

80
00:04:30,851 --> 00:04:31,684
respects,
because they can handle it or they seem 

81
00:04:33,701 --> 00:04:35,230
to be handling it.
And I couldn't.

82
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:39,040
Sometimes it makes me feel like I should
put them on a pedestal for me.

83
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:39,874
I can actually have a normal day and 
then I could go to an h and m and then 

84
00:04:43,271 --> 00:04:46,570
all of a sudden I'm getting flashbacks 
of the garment factory collapse.

85
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:51,930
Or I can watch a movie where people die 
and they get flashbacks of the more.

86
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,090
I saw corpses from the Muslim 
extremists.

87
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,073
We're.
Yeah,

88
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,333
I don't.
Let's not show them just to keep it on 

89
00:04:59,271 --> 00:05:00,860
me.
Sean is livid.

90
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:02,870
The conclusion I came to a few years 
ago,

91
00:05:02,871 --> 00:05:03,704
a conclusion that I entertained in the 
comfort of my largely painless 

92
00:05:06,891 --> 00:05:07,724
existence,
but one which I did not see through for 

93
00:05:11,151 --> 00:05:14,720
reasons of family,
vocation and cowardice.

94
00:05:14,721 --> 00:05:15,554
To see what maslow doesn't cover is 
whether or not it's okay to ascend the 

95
00:05:19,821 --> 00:05:20,654
hierarchy of needs when just one other 
person with whom you share the world 

96
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:28,790
lacks the fundamentals of life for any 
need of a lower order.

97
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:29,643
When people ask me,
I tell them that I'm a writer because I 

98
00:05:32,331 --> 00:05:33,164
feel I have a knack for it because I 
believed that I could add something 

99
00:05:37,071 --> 00:05:39,410
significant to the history of 
literature.

100
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,910
About 60 percent of me believes that 
more or less by turns.

101
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:44,773
Of course,
these things don't have to be mutually 

102
00:05:46,251 --> 00:05:47,450
exclusive.
The vlog brothers,

103
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,553
self actualizer is if there ever were,
have raised millions of dollars for 

104
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:56,090
charities through Kiva Dot Com and the 
project for awesome last year.

105
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:57,163
$14 of that project for awesome money 
went to kids in need of desks in Milan 

106
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,100
this year.
Tens of thousands of dollars.

107
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:04,934
These go into the uncultured project.
These things make a real difference in 

108
00:06:08,031 --> 00:06:11,840
the world,
but now I will return to my videos in my

109
00:06:11,841 --> 00:06:15,020
writing.
Sean will return to his hands on work in

110
00:06:15,021 --> 00:06:18,320
Bangladesh and though sat just inches 
apart.

111
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:22,130
We are separated by a Gulf of 
experience,

112
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,173
a Gulf of pain and suffering and a 
sensory knowledge of privileges that 

113
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:32,050
feel to me like mere facts,
a golf which I cannot cross.

114
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:37,730
Let me go for which many in Bangladesh 
and to some extent me can never cross.

115
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:47,910
Hey everybody.
Thanks for watching.

116
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:48,953
Thank you.
So,

117
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:54,660
so here's the do one take videos.
So I get to do this.

118
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:57,503
It will be here for quite a while.
So if you should check out his other 

119
00:07:00,721 --> 00:07:01,554
videos,
he will have invitations to various 

120
00:07:03,421 --> 00:07:04,254
video,
but no on what you're seeing us right 

121
00:07:05,731 --> 00:07:06,564
now.
There'll be an annotation to the 

122
00:07:06,991 --> 00:07:07,824
uncultured project.
Goes there and watch all of Sean's 

123
00:07:09,991 --> 00:07:13,110
videos.
I admire everything he does.

124
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:17,880
I think it's absolutely incredible and I
think you'll think that to get here.
