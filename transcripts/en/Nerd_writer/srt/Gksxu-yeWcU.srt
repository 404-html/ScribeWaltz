1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:03,450
Here's a question for aspiring 
screenwriters.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:04,673
Is it possible to make the movie 
passengers better with some relatively 

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,470
minor changes?
You know,

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:11,363
I don't think this is a really bad film.
After hearing reviews from friends and 

5
00:00:14,461 --> 00:00:16,500
online,
I sort of expected it to be,

6
00:00:16,501 --> 00:00:18,840
but I think that feeling was mostly 
disappointed.

7
00:00:18,841 --> 00:00:21,930
Expectation passengers is by no means a 
train wreck.

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,530
It's just really,
really predictable to the plot goes like

9
00:00:25,531 --> 00:00:27,210
this.
After the interstellar spaceship,

10
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,930
avalon malfunctions,
Chris Pratt wakes up from hyper sleep 90

11
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:34,470
years before he supposed to 90 years 
before anyone else on the ship.

12
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,633
You can't go back to sleep.
You can't contact her if you can't get 

13
00:00:37,801 --> 00:00:38,634
to the ship's controls.
He tries to do all of these things and 

14
00:00:40,531 --> 00:00:42,270
fails.
As a year passes.

15
00:00:42,271 --> 00:00:43,104
He grows increasingly sad and hopeless,
so eventually he decides to wake up 

16
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,633
another passenger,
Jennifer Lawrence condemning her to the 

17
00:00:49,561 --> 00:00:50,394
same fate,
essentially death in order to give 

18
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:53,460
himself some more company.

19
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,000
He acts like gets another malfunction.
He doesn't tell her after a while,

20
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:00,930
they fall in love.
She finds out the truth gets really mad,

21
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,450
and then the ship begins to really 
malfunctioned.

22
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,313
So Pratt sacrifices himself to save it,
but in the end she saves him a fall in 

23
00:01:08,221 --> 00:01:09,054
love again and spend the rest of their 
lives alone on the ship happily ever 

24
00:01:12,301 --> 00:01:12,991
after.
Oh,

25
00:01:12,991 --> 00:01:17,991
and Laurence Fishburne send it to about 
12 or 13 minutes and act three,

26
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:20,010
but you know,
count your blessings.

27
00:01:20,011 --> 00:01:22,920
It's way better than what Oscar 
nominated actor Andy Garcia got.

28
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:26,550
So you can break this blood up into five
basic turning points.

29
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:27,413
One,
Chris Wakes up to Chris Wakes Jennifer 

30
00:01:29,351 --> 00:01:30,210
up.
Three,

31
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:34,230
she finds out for Chris Sacrifices 
himself and five,

32
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:35,183
she forgives him.
The most acute tension in the film 

33
00:01:36,991 --> 00:01:37,824
happens between parts two and three.
When Jennifer starts to fall in love 

34
00:01:40,411 --> 00:01:42,480
with Chris,
but doesn't yet know the truth.

35
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:45,210
We know the truth is coming.
There's a little dramatic irony there.

36
00:01:45,211 --> 00:01:49,350
And so we wait with increasing anxiety 
until it does and when it does,

37
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,213
predictably,
Jennifer freaks out predictably and we 

38
00:01:52,471 --> 00:01:55,080
feel a little sadness predictably at 
this point,

39
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:55,973
exactly an hour into the movie.
The script has sort of written itself 

40
00:01:58,741 --> 00:01:59,574
into a corner because Pratt is the real 
main character because we spend 30 

41
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:03,624
minutes alone with him at the start of 
the film and see everything through his 

42
00:02:06,061 --> 00:02:06,894
eyes.
There's really only two paths to take 

43
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:09,594
regarding the central relationship.
Either he dies or she forgives him in 

44
00:02:14,071 --> 00:02:14,904
both ways.
He finds APP solution for the sin he 

45
00:02:16,621 --> 00:02:20,220
committed because you're not going to be
able to turn him bad.

46
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:21,123
Not a character like this,
not unless you have five seasons to do 

47
00:02:23,911 --> 00:02:24,631
it,
and yes,

48
00:02:24,631 --> 00:02:26,700
I know there are some illusions to the 
shining here,

49
00:02:26,701 --> 00:02:27,534
put the shining,
spent pretty much no time at all and 

50
00:02:29,321 --> 00:02:31,440
deering us to the character of Jack 
Torrance.

51
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:34,620
Passenger spends the whole first act and
during us to the lovable,

52
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:35,880
scrappy,
Chris Pratt.

53
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:39,690
It's clear the creators or the studio 
were intent on this being a love story,

54
00:02:39,691 --> 00:02:41,850
so they chose to go with the schmaltzy 
ending,

55
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,630
but they could have chosen either the 
last 45 minutes would have been the same

56
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:46,543
movie,
pretty much devoid of real tension or 

57
00:02:48,361 --> 00:02:49,194
suspense,
which requires a completely new plot 

58
00:02:51,031 --> 00:02:52,200
device.
In the third act.

59
00:02:52,201 --> 00:02:54,480
The total malfunction of the ship to 
juice,

60
00:02:54,481 --> 00:02:56,430
the ending with some adrenaline.
You know,

61
00:02:56,431 --> 00:02:59,380
a couple of weeks ago I was watching 
Chris Sztokman and Doug Walkers,

62
00:02:59,381 --> 00:03:00,214
joint review of passengers and Walker 
said something interesting if they told 

63
00:03:03,621 --> 00:03:05,360
this in a different order.
Yeah.

64
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:08,440
When have been 10 times more 
interesting.

65
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,720
The thing I began to wonder is what if 
you rearrange the movie so that Jennifer

66
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:15,910
Lawrence was the point of view 
character,

67
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,193
not Chris Pratt.
What if the film began with her 

68
00:03:19,841 --> 00:03:21,040
experience?
Well,

69
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:24,430
I couldn't stop thinking about it,
so I re edited the existing footage.

70
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:29,790
See what would happen to the story.
Good morning,

71
00:03:41,611 --> 00:03:43,050
Aurora.
How are you feeling?

72
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,350
You just spent 120 years of suspended 
animation.

73
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:50,930
Grand Concourse.

74
00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:01,830
Anybody?
Hello?

75
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:08,260
Hi,
he passenger or crew passenger?

76
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:13,330
Jim Preston.
Do you know what's going on?

77
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,500
Nobody else from my Robo Cup.

78
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:21,240
Same for me when I made this change and 
just watched from there some interesting

79
00:04:21,241 --> 00:04:23,430
things started to happen.
First of all,

80
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:27,090
the first act changes its tone entirely 
with the original first act.

81
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,280
You're wandering around the ship with 
Chris Pratt.

82
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:30,443
You learn cool things.
You see him come to terms with the 

83
00:04:32,191 --> 00:04:33,720
situation,
have fun,

84
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:34,613
get depressed,
and finally reached the ethical dilemma 

85
00:04:36,571 --> 00:04:40,530
that's meant to animate the movie.
What you see is what you get here,

86
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,650
which makes for a somewhat passive 
viewing experience.

87
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:44,813
It's an amazing sequence,
but that's mostly down to cool 

88
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:49,510
production design and pratts always 
charming performance.

89
00:04:49,511 --> 00:04:52,320
I guess I am going to die of old age on 
this ship,

90
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:56,490
but in the new first act,
the story is infused from the start with

91
00:04:56,491 --> 00:04:58,770
mystery.
When I made the editing changes,

92
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:03,000
I was genuinely surprised by just how 
creepy pratts character is.

93
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,013
When you take away his point of view,
we don't know whether to trust him or 

94
00:05:06,841 --> 00:05:08,070
not,
believe him or not,

95
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,083
and that makes the audience's experience
an active one in every moment to you 

96
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:15,440
know what's going on.
Nobody else from my robot

97
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:16,323
cut.

98
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,213
Same for me as he leads Jennifer around 
the ship locations become crime scenes 

99
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:24,550
where the viewer tries to figure out 
what's happening.

100
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:25,600
This of course,
by the way,

101
00:05:25,601 --> 00:05:28,000
is what makes Andrei Tarkovsky Solara so
great.

102
00:05:28,001 --> 00:05:28,834
So much has happened on Solaris by the 
time the lead character arrives that he 

103
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:36,070
and the audience have to piece the 
fragments together themselves.

104
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,110
I mean,
just look at how creepy he is.

105
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:39,003
I actually think that pratts performance
takes on more dimensions from this 

106
00:05:41,621 --> 00:05:42,454
angle.
You're not always forced to see him as 

107
00:05:43,451 --> 00:05:44,284
sympathetic,
so his darker side comes out in greater 

108
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:47,440
relief.
More important than that.

109
00:05:47,441 --> 00:05:48,274
That dark choice that sits at the heart 
of this film hits with greater impact 

110
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:54,340
when seen from the first time from 
Lawrence's perspective,

111
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:58,220
because we feel the cruelty as she feels
it too to your wake me up.

112
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:01,483
I try not to,
so now we're at the point where the 

113
00:06:05,241 --> 00:06:08,660
original story hits that dead end,
but with this new edit,

114
00:06:08,661 --> 00:06:12,140
you have some more options to play with.
Namely with this configuration,

115
00:06:12,141 --> 00:06:14,510
you could actually turn Pratt into the 
villain.

116
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,373
The original film suggests that can't 
follow through on and make passengers 

117
00:06:18,981 --> 00:06:22,670
into the thriller horror film that so 
many critics wanted to see.

118
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,713
You could even cut back in that whole 
first section of Chris's time alone on 

119
00:06:26,481 --> 00:06:27,314
the ship,
but put it after the revelation without 

120
00:06:29,361 --> 00:06:32,900
the need to justify his good guidance.
You could show a deeper,

121
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:33,763
more desperate side to his loneliness.
Something that I think actually would 

122
00:06:36,591 --> 00:06:41,300
make him more sympathetic in the end and
the choice he makes more agonizing.

123
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:00,003
Of course,
the simple cut and paste doesn't solve 

124
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:03,910
every problem in the script.
The ending,

125
00:07:03,911 --> 00:07:05,440
for example,
there's still an issue.

126
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:08,260
I think you'd want to remove the 
malfunction macguffin,

127
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:12,370
but it might be just as trite to close 
the story and true horror fashion.

128
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,090
It could be cool to give it a twilight 
zone ending as Peter Spread at slashfilm

129
00:07:16,091 --> 00:07:20,710
suggested and have di and Lawrence get 
so lonely that she begins to contemplate

130
00:07:20,711 --> 00:07:21,544
the same horrible choice.
Brainstorming like this is obviously 

131
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:25,383
really fun and much easier than actually
writing a movie and making one for all 

132
00:07:28,631 --> 00:07:29,464
its faults.
Passengers is a big budget movie with a 

133
00:07:30,941 --> 00:07:31,774
completely original script and that 
should be celebrated because it's a 

134
00:07:34,931 --> 00:07:36,460
dying breed,
but if I'm like,

135
00:07:36,461 --> 00:07:37,294
this is a good opportunity for would be 
screenwriters to think about story 

136
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,343
because you can learn just as much from 
films that don't work as you can from 

137
00:07:44,891 --> 00:07:45,724
those that do.

138
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,270
Everybody.
Thank you so much for watching.

139
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:52,490
This episode was brought to you by 
dollar shave club.

140
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:53,493
Might have noticed that I have a beard.
Everybody with the beard will tell you 

141
00:07:55,731 --> 00:07:56,564
that if you don't keep things clean,
it can get really scruffy really 

142
00:07:58,581 --> 00:07:59,414
quickly,
so I use dollar shave club razors to 

143
00:08:00,621 --> 00:08:01,454
make sure all the lines on my neck and 
cheeks are smooth and even and it's the 

144
00:08:04,461 --> 00:08:05,294
smarter choice because they send 
everything you need right to your door 

145
00:08:07,251 --> 00:08:09,740
at an affordable price.
You have to go to the store.

146
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:13,040
You don't have to spend money on 
unnecessary technology and for a limited

147
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:16,550
time you can get the executive razor 
with a tube of Dr.

148
00:08:16,551 --> 00:08:17,384
carver's shave butter for just $5,
no shipping fee and razors are only a 

149
