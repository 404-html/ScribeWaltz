00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,900
Bye.
Paul Cezanne is a painting that dawns on

2
00:00:17,901 --> 00:00:22,610
you at first you see the whole group of 
women bathing by a river,

3
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:23,743
a subject that's anything but original.
The canvas is composed in a balanced 

4
00:00:27,411 --> 00:00:30,320
geometry of triangles,
one for the group on the left,

5
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:31,183
one for those on the right and one 
comprising them all bounded by the 

6
00:00:34,821 --> 00:00:36,890
leaning trees,
but after a minute,

7
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:37,783
you start to notice things like the 
figures behind the river or the swimmer 

8
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,390
in the water,
or almost disturbingly,

9
00:00:44,391 --> 00:00:45,224
that none of the bathers have any 
definable faces or that their bodies 

10
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:52,010
seemed to fold into one another as if 
they'd been painted over,

11
00:00:52,011 --> 00:00:55,280
but not completely.
The more you stare at it,

12
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:56,143
the more the canvas seems a chaos of 
elements deliriously rendered with the 

13
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:04,610
spontaneity that feels almost negligent.
Of course,

14
00:01:04,611 --> 00:01:05,444
we know that Cezanne labored on this 
painting for seven years all the way up 

15
00:01:09,231 --> 00:01:10,064
to his death.

16
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,620
Spontaneity is certainly part of the 
message,

17
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:13,603
but the painter was intensely purposeful
in what he wanted to say and how he 

18
00:01:17,901 --> 00:01:18,734
wanted to convey it.
From our perspective across the Gulf of 

19
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:24,740
cubism and all imaginable forms of 
abstraction,

20
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:29,300
it's hard for us Cezanne's distortions 
of color and form to shock us,

21
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,910
yet that's exactly what they did in 19 
Oh,

22
00:01:31,911 --> 00:01:34,340
six.
At the paintings first exhibition.

23
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:39,500
It's not wrong to say that Cezanne 
initiated what became the 20th century's

24
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:43,070
endless experimentation as Picasso 
himself said,

25
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:46,910
Cezanne is the father of us all in this 
way.

26
00:01:46,911 --> 00:01:47,744
He can sort of be seen as the bridge 
between what came before and all that 

27
00:01:52,251 --> 00:01:55,400
was to come.
The large bathers reaches in the past.

28
00:01:55,401 --> 00:01:56,234
We're calling similar scenes of nudes or
bathers like those by Titian or Nicola 

29
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:00,903
who sewn or Thomas Eakins among others 
certain of the figures of vote postures 

30
00:02:04,851 --> 00:02:05,960
from older works.

31
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,780
The women on the left striding upwards 
with the tree,

32
00:02:08,781 --> 00:02:09,614
for example,
bears a resemblance to an 18th century 

33
00:02:11,871 --> 00:02:12,704
sculpture of the goddess Diana,
or take the woman on the right here 

34
00:02:16,161 --> 00:02:16,994
who's raised knee and shoulders.
Remember the classical Venus de Milo by 

35
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:24,890
Alexandros of Antioch,
and perhaps it should be noted that none

36
00:02:24,891 --> 00:02:29,450
of the 14 women we see here were drawn 
from real models.

37
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:33,410
Suzanne took his examples from other 
works and picture books,

38
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,423
adding to that disquieting sense of 
remove that these figures have from any 

39
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:39,374
identifiable personalities that remove 
that alienation is echoed everywhere in 

40
00:02:44,661 --> 00:02:45,494
the painting of the 14 women,
six or simply turned away from the 

41
00:02:48,741 --> 00:02:49,574
viewer,
a few or even in the process of 

42
00:02:50,721 --> 00:02:54,200
dissolving or emerging from the foliage.
All around them,

43
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:58,490
most unsettling have all the figures are
pocked with areas of white,

44
00:02:58,491 --> 00:03:02,950
which on closer examination proves not 
to be any paint at all,

45
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:03,993
but the bare canvas itself interrupting 
the scene as if some force from a world 

46
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:11,890
beyond what is Cezanne trying to do 
here,

47
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:12,724
what are these disturbances amount to 
what are the effects of his short flat 

48
00:03:16,811 --> 00:03:17,644
brush strokes of distilling everything 
into its geometrical basis or freezing 

49
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:25,570
in paint that which doesn't appear to be
a scene at all,

50
00:03:25,571 --> 00:03:26,404
but something on the verge of becoming a
scene where else have dissolving out of 

51
00:03:31,031 --> 00:03:34,120
one Cezanne is emerging out of 
impressionism.

52
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,043
A movement that was obsessed with how 
colors and light really appeared to the 

53
00:03:39,521 --> 00:03:41,110
eye.
How did the atmosphere,

54
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:45,760
the rain or the sunset effect the visual
impression of the Observer?

55
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:46,623
The impressionists explored this by 
going out into nature and painting 

56
00:03:49,781 --> 00:03:53,770
rapidly applying just what they saw to 
the canvas in front of them.

57
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:56,440
Cezanne took the pallet of the 
impressionists,

58
00:03:56,441 --> 00:03:57,274
retaining the brilliant,
often surprising colors used to evoke 

59
00:04:00,221 --> 00:04:01,054
nature's effect on us,
but he took color a step further and 

60
00:04:04,241 --> 00:04:05,074
applied it to express form as well.
Ever since the renaissance depth was 

61
00:04:09,281 --> 00:04:10,114
rendered via perspective.
Cezanne seems to realize that 

62
00:04:13,811 --> 00:04:18,811
renaissance perspective is only a kind 
of code by which we understand the third

63
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:20,374
dimension and a canvas seeing itself.
The perception as distinct from the 

64
00:04:24,401 --> 00:04:27,280
understanding may not work on those 
principles.

65
00:04:27,281 --> 00:04:28,114
It may be far more unruly than that.
This is why he didn't shy away from 

66
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:36,850
distortion of objects of using colors to
bring elements in the background forward

67
00:04:36,851 --> 00:04:37,684
or melt things in the foreground into 
the architecture of colors that hold 

68
00:04:41,441 --> 00:04:42,030
them there.

69
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:47,030
There's a difference between the way we 
know what we see and how we actually see

70
00:04:47,831 --> 00:04:48,664
it.
Our minds are so incredibly good at 

71
00:04:50,921 --> 00:04:51,754
taking the anarchic varieties of 
sensible experience and within 

72
00:04:55,301 --> 00:04:58,870
milliseconds composing them into 
intelligible holes.

73
00:04:59,140 --> 00:04:59,973
It happens so fast that we can't even 
access that actual moment of perception 

74
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:08,650
and for the most part we should be happy
about that because raw experience like a

75
00:05:08,651 --> 00:05:12,600
kind of trauma,
it's just too much for us to extend.

76
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:13,913
In the large bathers.
Cezanne uses his various techniques to 

77
00:05:16,811 --> 00:05:20,650
visit that moment of perception,
confronted with it aesthetically.

78
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:25,830
All that's unsettling about experience 
is frozen for our contemplation in life.

79
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:27,603
It's a bridge we just can't cross and 
take a look at that man on the other 

80
00:05:30,521 --> 00:05:31,354
side of the river.
Many think that this figure is cezanne 

81
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:34,624
himself situated between the classical 
constructed dire ama have bathers and 

82
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:42,610
the pastoral impressionistic church 
scene in the distance.

83
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:47,440
Now I bet if we could turn the painting 
around and see it from that perspective,

84
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,573
it would look just as sensual,
erotic and beautiful as something by 

85
00:05:51,461 --> 00:05:55,480
Titian or any other painter who depicted
a similar scene in the past,

86
00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:00,170
but from our vantage,
the one Cezanne gave to us,

87
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:05,530
we're allowed a fugitive access to 
something far more disturbing the wheel.

88
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:15,461
He,
everybody,

89
00:06:15,461 --> 00:06:17,620
if you want to help me keep making these
videos,

90
00:06:17,621 --> 00:06:20,380
I'm doing a big push for patrion 
pledges.

91
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:22,990
Everything helps as little as $1 per 
video.

92
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:24,243
It really is the pledges that allow me 
to continue making this channel and you 

93
00:06:27,991 --> 00:06:28,811
know,
the more I get,

94
00:06:28,811 --> 00:06:29,644
the more time and effort I can spend on 
making really cool stuff and I have a 

95
00:06:33,131 --> 00:06:37,360
lot of stuff in the works right now 
which is going to be really great if you

96
00:06:37,361 --> 00:06:38,194
think the nerd writer is something that 
you're not seeing anywhere else and you 

97
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:41,374
want to see more of it.
I'm pledging is really the way to help 

98
00:06:43,511 --> 00:06:44,740
me.
So thank you so much.

99
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,750
And here are some more videos.
