1
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:22,940
Anyone familiar with the work of 
director?

2
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:28,060
David Cronenberg knows that he has an 
intense fascination with bodies,

3
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:34,160
physical bodies,
bodies transformed or bodies mutilated,

4
00:00:34,161 --> 00:00:39,161
bodies dripping or bodies explode,
so it's no surprise that his film,

5
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,490
eastern promises opens with a focus on 
three bodies,

6
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:44,653
the sliced body of a Chechen gangster,
the wounded expiring body of a pregnant 

7
00:00:48,741 --> 00:00:49,574
prostitute,
and the fragile small body of that 

8
00:00:52,101 --> 00:00:55,100
woman's infant who is soaked in her 
blood.

9
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:56,323
It will eventually become clear that 
these three bodies are connected by the 

10
00:00:59,301 --> 00:01:00,134
films narrative.
A point that is made explicit early on 

11
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:07,450
by one character's poor grasp of English
barrier secrets was her body's indeed.

12
00:01:11,301 --> 00:01:12,134
It is a central theme of Cronenberg that
body's only exist within a continuum of 

13
00:01:16,191 --> 00:01:20,660
other bodies to which they are connected
and from which they gain meaning.

14
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:22,043
For Cronenberg,
the body is representative of the 

15
00:01:24,471 --> 00:01:27,620
individual,
perhaps even more so than the mind,

16
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:28,663
despite the fact that we're mental 
creatures conceiving of things in 

17
00:01:31,311 --> 00:01:32,144
abstraction,
we are irrevocably tied to the physical 

18
00:01:34,791 --> 00:01:35,624
organism that's given to us and much of 
our anxiety about aging or disease or 

19
00:01:40,071 --> 00:01:44,150
deformity is directed toward the body in
eastern promises.

20
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,013
The physical reality of the body is 
examined in the context of the equally 

21
00:01:48,591 --> 00:01:49,424
physical reality of collective violence,
of which bodies are it's perpetrators 

22
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,793
and victims.
A Cronenberg only has a few scenes that 

23
00:01:57,141 --> 00:02:00,080
actually show that violence,
I think five in total,

24
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,153
but their presence saturates the rest of
the film and you're lingering memories 

25
00:02:05,031 --> 00:02:07,040
of it,
but take the very first scene,

26
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:09,530
the throat slitting,
the way it's filmed.

27
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,560
You're not allowed any distance from the
action.

28
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,450
You're right,
they're your own neck.

29
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,433
Feels sensitive.
Your own hand feels like it's holding 

30
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:18,613
the knife.
Cronenberg is a genius at placing the 

31
00:02:20,931 --> 00:02:24,500
audience in the middle of body on body 
clashes like this one.

32
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:28,430
The violence is literally embodied by 
the viewer,

33
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,710
but before I get too far ahead of 
myself,

34
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:31,573
eastern promises tells the story of the 
expatriate Russian mafia in London and 

35
00:02:36,141 --> 00:02:36,974
the ripples that run through it.
When a midwife played by Naomi Watts 

36
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:44,270
uncovers a diary with potentially 
damaging evidence against the family.

37
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,433
Connected to this is the story of 
Nikolai played expertly by Viggo 

38
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:52,580
Mortensen,
a driver slash thug who's ruthlessness,

39
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:57,200
judgment and efficiency propels him up 
the ranks of the crime organization.

40
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:58,453
That organization and the Russian crime 
world in general is evidenced on 

41
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:06,450
individual members by tattoos that tell 
the story of their lives and their rank,

42
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:12,330
emphasizing the real bodily relationship
between individuals and the group,

43
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:16,840
and I have tattoos.
You don't exist as well as a captain.

44
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,913
This body,
this corpse who the audience knows was 

45
00:03:20,021 --> 00:03:23,170
professionally processed by Nikolai 
earlier in the film,

46
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:27,910
sets up an interesting contrast because 
of that processing.

47
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:31,030
The police can't identify the 
individual,

48
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:34,180
only that individual's rank and history 
of crime,

49
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:35,693
and here's an example of how 
individuality is sacrificed to the 

50
00:03:38,381 --> 00:03:39,214
collective.
Most groups and especially those that 

51
00:03:40,961 --> 00:03:41,794
use violence as a means organized 
themselves around some kind of common 

52
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,293
ideal,
some code or traditional escalate God 

53
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:49,443
says,
never speak to anybody about you'll get 

54
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,360
sane individuals.

55
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,193
It's often hypothesize,
need a shared code like this to commit 

56
00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:01,270
acts of cruelty because in a group those
acts can be attributed to the collective

57
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,193
and it's goals and the individual 
doesn't have to face responsibility or 

58
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,633
individuality is that I think this makes
for a paradox and the problem or the 

59
00:04:11,801 --> 00:04:16,600
paradox is that collectives often ask 
people to relinquish individuality,

60
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:21,150
but the thing that defines individuality
and identity for so many people is their

61
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,520
place within a collective.
More on that in a moment.

62
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:25,503
The problem is that once a person 
sacrifices part of his or her 

63
00:04:28,391 --> 00:04:29,224
individuality to the group,
the group can then sacrifice the 

64
00:04:32,411 --> 00:04:36,100
individual Tatiana,
the pregnant woman from the beginning of

65
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,140
the film,
who's voiceover diary entries,

66
00:04:38,141 --> 00:04:38,974
hang like a specter over everything that
happens left Russia to find a better 

67
00:04:42,971 --> 00:04:45,760
life in the multicultural collective of 
London,

68
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:47,043
but she was absorbed into a vicious 
subgroup of that collective that 

69
00:04:49,991 --> 00:04:53,530
sacrificed her individuality for its own
ends.

70
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:54,933
Anna,
the midwife wants to connect with her 

71
00:04:56,081 --> 00:04:56,914
Russian heritage,
but she too brings herself within the 

72
00:04:58,781 --> 00:05:01,270
orbit of the Mafia.
Escaping.

73
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,223
We're Tatiana could not.
The head of the mafia son played by 

74
00:05:04,511 --> 00:05:09,430
Vincent Cassel is genetically linked to 
his fucking birthmark,

75
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:12,970
which means he has to sacrifice his 
homosexuality,

76
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:13,823
his individual truth to an organization 
and a culture that rejects such a 

77
00:05:17,831 --> 00:05:21,280
lifestyle at the risk of being 
ostracized or worse.

78
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:22,750
It's worth noting,
of course,

79
00:05:22,751 --> 00:05:23,584
that Cronenberg uses this case to 
highlight the way men use their bodies 

80
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:31,240
to project masculinity real or fake.
Of course,

81
00:05:31,241 --> 00:05:32,074
the major case study here is that 
Nikolai Nikolai sacrifices himself to 

82
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:37,294
the Russian mafia,
made perfectly clear by the way he 

83
00:05:39,611 --> 00:05:40,444
prefers his naked body to the group and 
the ritual almost eroticize scene in 

84
00:05:44,741 --> 00:05:48,670
which he earns the star tattoos almost 
immediately after this.

85
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,570
He learns the cost of that sacrifice 
when he is betrayed.

86
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:03,410
This isn't only one of the best scenes 
in film history,

87
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,150
beautifully choreographed,
filmed,

88
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:09,560
but it's the scene that brings all of 
Cronenberg's themes to a climax.

89
00:06:09,561 --> 00:06:13,850
This matrix of individual collective 
body and violence.

90
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:15,043
Individuals subsumed in groups like the 
Russian mafia or in a strange kind of 

91
00:06:18,981 --> 00:06:19,814
crisis.
The group doesn't so much demand the 

92
00:06:21,771 --> 00:06:22,604
disillusion of individuality,
but rather the maintenance of 

93
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,510
individuality that's always united with 
the group's intentions.

94
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:32,390
It's easy to see how paradoxical that 
is.

95
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:37,340
How can individuals define themselves by
connection to an organization that makes

96
00:06:37,341 --> 00:06:40,060
them interchangeable in the bathhouse 
seen,

97
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:44,150
the Russian mob uses this 
interchangeability to betray Nicholi,

98
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,080
letting the Chechens identify him as 
someone else by his tattoos.

99
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:49,163
Of course,
the tattoos or a form of body 

100
00:06:50,181 --> 00:06:51,970
manipulation that individuals like 
Nicole,

101
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:56,980
I use to code this paradoxical identity 
into reality to make it real.

102
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,263
A Cronenberg and Mortenson have Nikolai 
fight naked in order to show that by 

103
00:07:01,941 --> 00:07:02,774
joining this group,
it's not only individuality that's made 

104
00:07:05,121 --> 00:07:05,954
vulnerable,
but the body itself and when it's 

105
00:07:08,331 --> 00:07:08,900
revealed.

106
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:09,733
Finally,
that Nikolai is actually an undercover 

107
00:07:11,841 --> 00:07:12,674
agent.
It's these cuts and bruises that prove 

108
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:17,570
his devotion to another kind of 
collective,

109
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:18,733
the police and realize his identity as a
hero who uses the rules of individuals 

110
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:28,541
and groups to his own advantage.
Cronenberg is a master filmmaker because

111
00:07:29,451 --> 00:07:30,284
he can use the elements of a crime genre
film written by someone else to 

112
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:35,204
interrogate these big themes.
Human beings are individuals in 

113
00:07:39,411 --> 00:07:42,050
collectives,
they our minds and bodies,

114
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:45,860
they operate within ideas where blood is
symbolic,

115
00:07:45,861 --> 00:07:46,694
just a color or a bouquet of roses and 
yet live in the physical world where 

116
00:07:50,961 --> 00:07:54,530
blood can send you to jail or be the 
last thing you ever see.

117
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:59,150
Among these themes are paradoxes that we
can't resolve,

118
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,313
but our body's exposed the truth that 
David Cronenberg wants us to remember 

119
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:09,310
that we are all the victims and the 
perpetrators of reality.

120
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,720
Hey everybody,
thanks for watching.

121
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:15,643
If you liked this video and you want to

Thank you.
Thank you for that.

129
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:35,803
I love this movie.
I think this is just a great example of 

130
00:08:38,781 --> 00:08:43,520
an amazing director elevating a genre 
movie to become something more than that

131
00:08:43,521 --> 00:08:45,650
by,
by the power of his directing,

132
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:48,650
what he chooses to focus on and the 
themes that he laces through it.

133
00:08:48,651 --> 00:08:51,860
So I love Cronenberg.
I might analyze more of his movies.

134
00:08:51,861 --> 00:08:53,510
I don't know,
but this is a fantastic one.

135
00:08:53,511 --> 00:08:55,340
I think I.
let me go Mortenson,

136
00:08:55,341 --> 00:08:57,710
so I will.
I'll see you guys next Wednesday.
