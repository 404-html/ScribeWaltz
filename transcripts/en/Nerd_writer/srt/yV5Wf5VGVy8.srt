1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:03,690
I'm not really a big fan of John 
luchador anymore.

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,470
I think.
I'm not trying to be disrespectful.

3
00:00:05,471 --> 00:00:06,304
I just think I've outgrown him because I
was so influential to me that the 

4
00:00:08,471 --> 00:00:09,304
beginning of my aesthetic,
it's a director of like wanting to be a 

5
00:00:12,401 --> 00:00:13,234
director.
He's kind of like lack of complete any 

6
00:00:15,431 --> 00:00:16,264
type of film style.
Just this wanting to make movies for 

7
00:00:18,581 --> 00:00:19,414
love of it is the one who taught me the 
fun and the freedom and the joy of of 

8
00:00:24,761 --> 00:00:27,940
breaking rules just fucking around with 
the entire medium.

9
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,040
Like many other things in our modern 
world.

10
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:39,323
The course of film history was changed 
forever by the Second World War that 

11
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:44,893
despite having grown out of him,
Quentin Tarantino's self-conscious 

12
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,013
postmodern aesthetic is a direct 
descendant of the self conscious 

13
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:57,051
postmodern work of John Luca Dart and 
the French new wave of which Godard is a

14
00:00:57,211 --> 00:00:58,044
pioneer,
emerges and is a response to the 

15
00:01:00,331 --> 00:01:03,910
circumstances arising out of the end of 
World War Two.

16
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:06,960
Let me explain.
A year after the end of the war,

17
00:01:06,961 --> 00:01:09,720
after the liberation of France from Nazi
control,

18
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,673
French Prime Minister Leon blue traveled
to Washington DC to meet with Secretary 

19
00:01:14,731 --> 00:01:15,564
of state,
James Burns can negotiate an agreement 

20
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:20,690
that would cancel Francis $2,000,000,000
ward.

21
00:01:20,691 --> 00:01:21,524
They're the result of the bloom burns 
agreement was the almost complete 

22
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:28,740
opening of French markets to American 
cultural products,

23
00:01:28,741 --> 00:01:31,650
particularly films before this 
agreement,

24
00:01:31,651 --> 00:01:32,484
France had imposed quotas on the number 
of American films allowed to play in 

25
00:01:36,121 --> 00:01:40,860
French theaters as a way to preserve the
unique identity of French cinema.

26
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,920
The Bloomberg's agreement decimated 
those quarters,

27
00:01:43,921 --> 00:01:44,754
resulting in the free market domination 
of American Hollywood movies in France 

28
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,093
into this universe.
The founding members of the French new 

29
00:01:52,681 --> 00:01:53,514
wave grew up in the pages of Du Cinema.
They advanced a new form of film theory 

30
00:01:58,441 --> 00:01:59,274
criticizing many of their French 
forefathers and praising the work of 

31
00:02:02,281 --> 00:02:04,830
Hollywood studio directors like Alfred 
Hitchcock,

32
00:02:04,831 --> 00:02:05,664
Orson Welles and John finished that job 
awash in hundreds of Hollywood movies 

33
00:02:10,981 --> 00:02:11,814
and in depth analysis of American art 
tourers Gianluca Dart makes breathless 

34
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,690
from a story treatment by new wave 
compatriots,

35
00:02:18,691 --> 00:02:19,524
Francois Truffaut and Claude chabrol.
Breathless is an extended investigation 

36
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,103
of a French filmmaker identity in the 
shadow of Hollywood dominance of indeed 

37
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:33,990
whether an identity informed by another 
nation's culture can exist at all.

38
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,840
Breathless tells the story of small time
Crook,

39
00:02:36,841 --> 00:02:37,674
Michelle in the aftermath of his murder 
of a police officer on his way to see 

40
00:02:41,191 --> 00:02:44,100
his American lover,
Patricia in Paris.

41
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,203
Michel models his personality on 
Humphrey Bogart just as the film models 

42
00:02:49,081 --> 00:02:53,370
itself on the Hollywood crime thriller,
but in both cases,

43
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:57,000
these identifications are continually 
frustrated.

44
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:58,223
For example,
take a look at the films inciting 

45
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:00,933
incident.
The film opens with Michelle dressed 

46
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:03,583
like a parody of an American gangster 
mimicking a gesture attributed to folk 

47
00:03:07,631 --> 00:03:08,464
art.
He then steals and American oldsmobile 

48
00:03:10,331 --> 00:03:11,164
from an American military officer,
which almost immediately furnishes him 

49
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:17,080
with an implement to make his identity 
complete.

50
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:19,150
A revolver.
After running a light,

51
00:03:19,151 --> 00:03:21,820
Michelle is chased by two motorcycle 
cops.

52
00:03:21,821 --> 00:03:22,654
One eventually tracks him down and a 
shootout and sues the classic dramatic 

53
00:03:26,141 --> 00:03:27,970
moment of the film,
the war,

54
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,200
but look at the sequence of shots in 
which this shootout I'm full.

55
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:47,780
The whole scene plays like a misfire of 
these kinds of moments.

56
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:51,890
Not only does a murderer seemed totally 
unmotivated for the crime committed,

57
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,170
but we don't even get to see the cops 
face.

58
00:03:54,171 --> 00:03:55,004
The shootout takes place over only five 
shots in 10 seconds with imagery and 

59
00:03:58,371 --> 00:03:59,204
sound effects out of sync,
and the camera impulsively favors 

60
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:02,443
extreme closeups that obscure the action
instead of wide shots that would have 

61
00:04:05,691 --> 00:04:10,160
made everything clear.
Everything in the sequence serves to rob

62
00:04:10,161 --> 00:04:12,830
me,
shell of his part in the confrontation.

63
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,040
The film itself intervenes to strip the 
scene down to bare formulaic elements.

64
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,513
In this way,
the film is always watching over 

65
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,753
Michelle,
making comments on his immature desire 

66
00:04:24,861 --> 00:04:25,694
to become bogart or actually 
interjecting itself to upset that 

67
00:04:28,911 --> 00:04:30,290
desire.
Later,

68
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:31,124
Michelle confronts a poster of his hero,
a giant image of Bogart from his very 

69
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,770
last movie.
The harder they fall,

70
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:41,120
you can see Michelle's Pale reflection 
being dwarfed by his hero,

71
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:43,700
and then you have a face off between the
two men,

72
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:47,780
both totally stone faced and unreadable 
seconds later,

73
00:04:47,781 --> 00:04:52,010
the film loudly announces itself by 
ending the scene with a wacky,

74
00:04:52,011 --> 00:04:54,070
awkward,
outmoded Iris.

75
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:58,420
What's being called to attention here?
Well,

76
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,450
I think the late film critic Dennis 
Turner gives us a hint when he cites the

77
00:05:02,451 --> 00:05:05,000
French psychoanalyst,
Jacques Lacan seat,

78
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:05,853
Louis Kahn's.
Most famous contribution to our 

79
00:05:07,431 --> 00:05:11,960
understanding of human development is 
something called the mirror stage.

80
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:12,823
It describes the moment when a baby 
first sees itself in the mirror is that 

81
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:17,613
little girl,
you too young to have any control yet 

82
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:22,543
over itself.
The infant recognizes a unity in its 

83
00:05:25,671 --> 00:05:26,504
mirror version and aspires to that unity
projecting itself into the place of the 

84
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,113
other.
This means that the very formation of 

85
00:05:34,311 --> 00:05:35,144
ourselves,
the first time we perceive ourselves as 

86
00:05:37,281 --> 00:05:40,610
a subject,
what we perceive is not really us.

87
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:44,660
It's an imaginary projection of us.
For this reason,

88
00:05:44,661 --> 00:05:47,930
the human subjects says Lacan is always 
divided.

89
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:48,764
It's never really hold.
Michelle is someone consumed by his 

90
00:05:52,371 --> 00:05:53,204
identification looking at bogart.
He doesn't recognize the impossibility 

91
00:05:56,781 --> 00:06:01,250
of his hero.
He just stares intently forward and it's

92
00:06:01,251 --> 00:06:02,084
left to the film and it's anachronistic,
fade out to inform us that it knows 

93
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,424
better.
Michelle's immaturity is matched by his 

94
00:06:12,341 --> 00:06:13,930
love interests,
Patricia,

95
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:17,910
that long famous scene that sits at the 
heart of this movie with Michelle.

96
00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:18,744
Hold up in Patricia's bedroom is 
proceeded by a long look in the mirror 

97
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:27,220
by Patricia and it features mirrors all 
the way through and images of lovers and

98
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:28,054
other men and women.
Both characters are lost in search of a 

99
00:06:31,421 --> 00:06:34,990
solid identity that might be reflected 
in the other.

100
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,470
There are back and forth is a constant 
oblique,

101
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,700
probing into the other,
hoping to mind some reaction,

102
00:06:40,701 --> 00:06:43,420
some statement that might explain 
finally

103
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:44,613
who they are.

104
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,193
At the end of the film,
Michelle finally gets everything he 

105
00:06:52,571 --> 00:06:53,404
needs to escape,
but after Patricia betrays him to the 

106
00:06:56,201 --> 00:06:59,440
police,
his imaginary identification with Bogart

107
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:00,693
is finally broke.
The tragedy is that the film still 

108
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:09,120
forces him along the tracks of the genre
inside which he's trapped.

109
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:13,570
The cops bumbling like silly parodies of
themselves all throughout the film still

110
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:18,600
nonetheless gunned him down breathless 
like it's hero oscillates.

111
00:07:19,361 --> 00:07:23,470
Between these two registers,
it wants to participate in the Hollywood

112
00:07:23,471 --> 00:07:27,520
filmmaking it admires,
but it knows that such an identification

113
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:28,383
is impossible.
So it deals with this by being self 

114
00:07:31,161 --> 00:07:33,070
conscious,
by using jump cuts,

115
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:33,933
awkward transitions,
by robbing the classic moments of their 

116
00:07:35,981 --> 00:07:36,814
force or making the heroes bloody final 
steps way longer than it could ever 

117
00:07:40,421 --> 00:07:43,540
possibly be forcing you outside of the 
films,

118
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:45,820
text or back into it.
Again,

119
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:50,410
depending on how you look at it,
it's no surprise that the effects of war

120
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:55,030
are fast and unexpected.
America flooded France with its films,

121
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:55,893
onto which the new wave filmmakers 
projected a superiority that they 

122
00:07:59,981 --> 00:08:03,400
created by then identifying with it in 
their movies.

123
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:04,563
In other words,
American economic dominance created an 

124
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:07,743
ideological dominance in the minds of 
dominated for the only way to deal with 

125
00:08:12,611 --> 00:08:17,611
this was to be conscious of the dynamic 
unfixed nature of these identities.

126
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:18,993
Indeed,
it's the only way that we can deal with 

127
00:08:20,951 --> 00:08:24,430
the dynamic unfixed nature of our own 
identities.

128
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:29,800
The unexpected thing is how influential 
that consciousness was

129
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:34,020
when it eventually came back across the 
Atlantic.

130
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,640
Hey everybody,
buddy,

131
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,473
thanks for watching.
The first set of nerd writer stickers 

132
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:43,603
have been sent out in the mail.
So you got some of those on Patriot and 

133
00:08:45,671 --> 00:08:46,481
check for that.
Also,

134
00:08:46,481 --> 00:08:48,400
there are a lot more sicker than I 
thought,

135
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:52,450
so I'm going to put up 60 more sets of 
those stickers on my patrion page,

136
00:08:52,451 --> 00:08:55,000
which you can claim by clicking right 
here,

137
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:57,960
pledging $3 per video,
and you get two stickers.

138
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:58,853
You've already got the reward I'd asked 
you to keep pledging just because you 

139
00:09:01,261 --> 00:09:03,030
know,
that's what makes this channel possible.

140
00:09:03,031 --> 00:09:04,460
My patriotic,

141
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:08,970
these videos take like 50 hours to make.
So it is a full time job,

142
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,010

143
00:09:11,011 --> 00:09:14,300
and I hope you guys see that reflected 
in the quality of the content.

144
00:09:14,301 --> 00:09:15,134
Um,
so thank you guys so much again and I 

145
00:09:16,441 --> 00:09:18,960
will see you all next Wednesday.
