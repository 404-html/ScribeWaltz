00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,060
Welcome to a New Year of coffee on a 
Tuesday and it's going to show.

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:06,630
This is going to be late.
I'm sorry,

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:07,823
45.

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,010
So I have a reason why the Vlog is late 
this week.

5
00:00:22,011 --> 00:00:25,220
And that reason is of course Downton 
Abbey.

6
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:29,750
I thought I would just see what the fuss
was about this thing.

7
00:00:29,751 --> 00:00:30,584
So you know,
just put on one episode that was going 

8
00:00:31,861 --> 00:00:34,970
to be it,
but then you didn't have to marry him,

9
00:00:34,971 --> 00:00:36,470
you know,
and then months ago,

10
00:00:36,471 --> 00:00:39,190
before I left theater said we needed a 
rat poison and I bought.

11
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:44,150
And then what am I sitting in a swivel 
chair?

12
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,550
So I lost track of time.
Okay.

13
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:53,690
The Crawley's watching the show episode 
by episode though dangerous to my day to

14
00:00:53,691 --> 00:00:56,330
day responsibilities,
gave me a sense of the shows,

15
00:00:56,331 --> 00:00:59,480
broader narrative for me.
The show seems to follow this pattern,

16
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:00,770
desire,
desire,

17
00:01:00,771 --> 00:01:03,470
desire,
giving into that desire.

18
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:04,453
Then dealing with the consequences,
negative or positive from getting into 

19
00:01:07,011 --> 00:01:10,100
that desire and then starting the 
process all over again with a new set of

20
00:01:10,101 --> 00:01:10,850
initial condition.

21
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:13,520
Is this what our lives are really like?
After all,

22
00:01:13,521 --> 00:01:14,354
we are creatures of desire each day 
we're pushed and pulled by once by her 

23
00:01:17,621 --> 00:01:20,060
desire for things,
for status,

24
00:01:20,061 --> 00:01:22,280
for people for pleasure,
small pleasures,

25
00:01:22,281 --> 00:01:24,410
feelings of pleasure are the easiest to 
obtain.

26
00:01:24,411 --> 00:01:25,244
It's why we drink coffee or alcohol.
It's why we do drugs or lose ourselves 

27
00:01:28,461 --> 00:01:30,540
and upstairs downstairs British drama.
Smith,

28
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:31,573
our desires for a more sustained 
pleasure for status or knowledge take 

29
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:35,803
time to achieve.
We stave off the fulfillment of more 

30
00:01:38,061 --> 00:01:39,680
immediate pleasures.
If we can,

31
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:42,260
to work for something great,
these greater desires,

32
00:01:42,261 --> 00:01:44,450
we often seek to justify it to other 
people.

33
00:01:44,451 --> 00:01:49,370
We tell them about our plants in that 
process which may take months or years.

34
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:53,550
We're learning and growing all the time 
and our desires often change.

35
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:57,920
Sometimes we realize that we don't want 
what we originally set out to achieve.

36
00:01:58,370 --> 00:01:59,203
We want something new,
but all the time and energy we put into 

37
00:02:01,251 --> 00:02:02,084
our now defunct desires and all the 
people we've told about them and the 

38
00:02:04,911 --> 00:02:05,744
desire itself repeated so many times 
that it's entangled in our 

39
00:02:08,601 --> 00:02:11,570
personalities,
makes any change very hard.

40
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,360
Here we are at the first step of the 
Downton Abbey formula.

41
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:18,590
Subversive desire begins to grow within 
our already organized,

42
00:02:18,591 --> 00:02:20,810
like organized by ourselves,
by others,

43
00:02:20,811 --> 00:02:24,170
by our social class,
until the pressure becomes too great and

44
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:25,063
we give in and opened the door to both 
our desire and the consequences that 

45
00:02:28,431 --> 00:02:31,310
come from action sometimes actually 
almost all the time.

46
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:34,040
In fact,
giving into new desires is a gamble.

47
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:39,050
We're gambling what we have for what we 
want and we may come out a loser on both

48
00:02:39,051 --> 00:02:39,884
counts down nabby shows us that the risk
for those with means is not nearly as 

49
00:02:43,281 --> 00:02:44,114
great as it is for those without though 
neither can seem to resist giving in at 

50
00:02:48,771 --> 00:02:49,604
least once in a while.
Both the upper and lower classes in our 

51
00:02:51,531 --> 00:02:52,364
case,
the great middleclass must face the 

52
00:02:54,141 --> 00:02:59,141
truly absurd truth that our short lives 
are constrained by arbitrary rules,

53
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:04,471
rules we ourselves made up and agreed to
many of our best desires go unfulfilled.

54
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:05,863
The desires made to expand us,
to open us the desire to live unimpeded 

55
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:16,240
in a world of impediments well that sad 
to think about.

56
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:20,540
Maybe I can cheer myself up with the 
first episode of

57
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:22,123
breaking bad.
