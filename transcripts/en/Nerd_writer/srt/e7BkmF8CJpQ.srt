1
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:12,610
Before you see one single image in the 
Lord of the Rings trilogy and you hear a

2
00:00:13,311 --> 00:00:18,311
chorus singing in a somewhat unsettling 
harmonic minor key over black,

3
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,580
this is a musical theme that signals the
Loft Florian else.

4
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:25,723
It's the theme of glad drill,
who's about to narrate the story of the 

5
00:00:28,971 --> 00:00:32,780
one ring and prologue,
but not before the rings.

6
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,840
Own feet fades in with the first title 
as the prologue ends and an e flat minor

7
00:00:45,951 --> 00:00:46,784
chord shifts to an e flat major.
The narration shifts also from 

8
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,750
collateral to Bilbo Sean and the mood 
changes.

9
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:54,703
The lighter shyer theme is introduced as
Bilbo places us there on a map and 

10
00:00:59,331 --> 00:01:01,790
finally,
after he places us in time,

11
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:07,300
the fellowship theme plays in full 
statement as its corresponding subtitled

12
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:10,250
fades in racketing,
the opening of the film.

13
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,520
Now,
if this masterful interplay of themes is

14
00:01:19,521 --> 00:01:24,200
it enough to prove to you already that 
composer Howard shore is a genius,

15
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:26,720
that's okay.
There's a lot more to say.

16
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:27,883
The first thing is that these four 
themes that I've mentioned are actually 

17
00:01:30,321 --> 00:01:35,321
what's called light motifs and operatic 
technique popularized by Richard Wagner,

18
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:39,740
that fuses musical themes with specific 
people,

19
00:01:39,741 --> 00:01:40,574
events or places to eat,
and in some cases augment the dramatic 

20
00:01:44,391 --> 00:01:45,224
development of a story.
In order to show how short develops his 

21
00:01:48,171 --> 00:01:49,004
light motifs.
I'm going to isolate one the fellowship 

22
00:01:51,831 --> 00:01:52,664
theme,
which has the most variations and focus 

23
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:57,320
on its development in the fellowship of 
the ring.

24
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:02,330
Now before the fellowship theme can come
together in its full heroic glory short,

25
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:03,164
builds it up with a few variations.
The first time we hear it after the 

26
00:02:06,111 --> 00:02:11,111
title is when Frodo and Sam leave.
The Shire on the road to Rivendale short

27
00:02:11,511 --> 00:02:15,770
presents a small snippet of the shyer 
theme of foreshadowing of that themes,

28
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:16,723
final variation at the end of the film,
and then transitions into a humble 

29
00:02:20,151 --> 00:02:24,380
statement of the fellowship theme using 
just French Horn and core,

30
00:02:24,381 --> 00:02:25,214
and Glen.

31
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:29,720
It's a dangerous business for them going
out gentle.

32
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:34,730
This is almost immediately contrasted 
with another darker variation as Gandalf

33
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,630
rides into isengard to take counsel with
Sal.

34
00:02:37,631 --> 00:02:38,464
Roma sure adds crashing cymbals and 
plays the theme off Gandalf's galloping 

35
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,400
horse in this tense variation,
prefigure Sarah Mons eventual portrayal,

36
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,350
and the two versions playing off each 
other,

37
00:02:48,351 --> 00:02:51,620
anticipate the eventual fracturing of 
the fellowship later in the film.

38
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:52,783
The next time we hear the theme,
Frodo and the hobbits have accepted 

39
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:58,550
stridor or eric as their temporary 
leader.

40
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,470
The fellowship is growing,
so the brass section is growing too.

41
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:05,830
We started with one French horn.
Now we have three,

42
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,083
but the state lead melody of the student
is upset with the Timpani drumbeat that 

43
00:03:10,181 --> 00:03:11,014
adds urgency.
The Fellowship Light Motif doesn't 

44
00:03:15,741 --> 00:03:16,574
appear again until after Frodo has been 
stabbed by the ring greats as our when 

45
00:03:20,421 --> 00:03:21,254
racist to get him to Rivendale.
The fellowship theme mixes with a 

46
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,293
Raytheon threatening to overtake it.
The fellowship might dissolve before it 

47
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:29,050
even has a chance to fully

48
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:30,223
form

49
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:35,913
at the middle of the film.
The fellowship finally comes together 

50
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:39,183
and sure echoes that by presenting a 
string of three fellowship theme 

51
00:03:42,851 --> 00:03:46,540
statements in their full orchestration 
and full glory.

52
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:47,853
First as l,
Ron announces the fellowship third as 

53
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:54,970
the fellowship strides heroically away 
on own

54
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:56,003
quest.

55
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:05,470
But the second one is the most 
interesting to me,

56
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,300
just as the fellowship is about to 
depart.

57
00:04:07,301 --> 00:04:08,134
Shore softly teases the Shire theme 
before eight is overpowered by the 

58
00:04:12,161 --> 00:04:12,994
fellowship theme,
suggesting that the hobbits priorities 

59
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,710
have shifted and they now have to live 
with the consequences of that,

60
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,053
and it ends with a unique harmony on the
second half of the full statement as if 

61
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:25,570
to sow a seed of doubt right into the 
middle of the team.

62
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,873
As it comes together,

63
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,103
fellowship,

64
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,470
we're going to get another exciting full
statement in the mines of Moria.

65
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,333
The only time that the nine members of 
the fellowship will be an action 

66
00:04:42,191 --> 00:04:43,840
together,
but the three,

67
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:44,693
four time signature of the fellowship is
quickly swallowed up by the five four 

68
00:04:48,491 --> 00:04:51,760
time signature of the orcs and from now 
on,

69
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:56,050
after Gandalf is lost,
the fellowship theme will only appear in

70
00:04:56,051 --> 00:04:59,590
fragmented form until the very end of 
the trilogy.

71
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,020
Your foods,
for example,

72
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,980
after what's left with the fellowship 
departs Laurian.

73
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,510
The theme can only muster violins and 
cor.

74
00:05:07,511 --> 00:05:08,344
Anglais and sure has this already weak 
variation trampled on as soon as it 

75
00:05:12,371 --> 00:05:16,390
starts.
Then as they rest on the shore,

76
00:05:16,391 --> 00:05:21,040
the light motif can't find its footing.
It wanders away from its full expression

77
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:26,041
as uncertainty and suspicion creep,
been facing these insecure variations on

78
00:05:28,331 --> 00:05:29,230
the theme,
Harold,

79
00:05:29,231 --> 00:05:32,610
the breaking of the fellowship,
first with the death of former,

80
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,110
then with the departure of Frodo and 
Sam,

81
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,543
in fact,
short links these two moments with a 

82
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,393
severely deflated but poignant rendition
of the light motif that fades into 

83
00:05:45,521 --> 00:05:46,354
silence

84
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:58,823
like the fellowship itself.
The fellowship theme builds to its full 

85
00:06:02,481 --> 00:06:03,314
formation and then is deconstructed 
until it's only a shell of its former 

86
00:06:07,191 --> 00:06:10,340
self.
Shore does this with instrumentation,

87
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,233
with tempo and with harmony,
and he does it for several other light 

88
00:06:14,331 --> 00:06:15,164
motifs in the trilogy,
weaving them back and forth and through 

89
00:06:18,141 --> 00:06:18,974
one another so that the result is a 
complex web that entwines with the 

90
00:06:22,881 --> 00:06:23,714
story.
I think that we hardly grasp the 

91
00:06:26,931 --> 00:06:27,764
importance of music in film.
It's an invisible layer of pure emotion 

92
00:06:31,941 --> 00:06:36,230
that guides us or challenges us or 
guides or challenges.

93
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,530
The drama itself and the Lord of the 
rings trilogy.

94
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,393
Howard shore gave us perhaps the most 
complete and complex exploration of 

95
00:06:44,661 --> 00:06:45,494
light motifs in the history of cinema 
and the result is a score that says 

96
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,620
alive as the world Tokyo gave us.

97
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:07,450
