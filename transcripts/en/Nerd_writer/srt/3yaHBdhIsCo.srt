1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,040
There's something about treasure that 
capture every imagination,

2
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:10,840
maybe it's our love for adventure or our
love for solving puzzles,

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:12,533
or maybe it's just the anxiety of 
knowing that something's out there 

4
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:20,020
waiting to be found in the mid 19 
seventies in England,

5
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:24,040
they're renowned publisher Tom Maschler 
approached a little known painter by the

6
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:24,874
name of Kit Williams.
If the idea of making a children's 

7
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:28,743
picture book maschler when it's 
something that no one had ever done 

8
00:00:30,791 --> 00:00:33,550
before,
but Williams was resistant to the idea.

9
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:35,980
He didn't want to work on a dozen or 
more paintings,

10
00:00:35,981 --> 00:00:38,170
only to have people flip through them 
casually.

11
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:39,213
How could he get readers to give his 
pictures the attention they deserve 

12
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:43,323
without telling maschler Williams came 
up with the idea of a puzzle book 

13
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,553
containing 16 original paintings that 
had clues to the location of the 18 

14
00:00:51,701 --> 00:00:56,701
karat gold rabbit that he constructed 
himself and buried somewhere in England.

15
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:02,150
Now the has been buried for.
The book was called masquerade.

16
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:06,340
It was published in 1979 and it was a 
massive hit.

17
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,233
It went completely crazy.
We thought we'd have enough till 

18
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:12,980
Christmas and we reprinted a further 
50,000

19
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,550
a day off to publication and three days 
later,

20
00:01:15,551 --> 00:01:17,930
yet another $50,000,
I've really never seen it,

21
00:01:17,931 --> 00:01:20,110
but blanket thousands,
tens of thousands,

22
00:01:20,111 --> 00:01:24,100
hundreds of thousands of people set 
about solving the puzzle of masquerade.

23
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:28,030
A year went by and to and still nobody 
had cracked it,

24
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:31,330
but Williams was receiving huge numbers 
of letters every day,

25
00:01:31,331 --> 00:01:35,620
which she was forced to read or at least
skim through so he could confirm whether

26
00:01:35,621 --> 00:01:36,730
anyone had solved it.

27
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:42,290
This package,
this has been going on for so long.

28
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:46,980
Then

29
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:50,280
in March 1982,
a little over two and a half years after

30
00:01:50,281 --> 00:01:51,114
Williams buried the hair,
he received a letter from a man named 

31
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,533
Ken Thomas.
The letter didn't have any insight into 

32
00:01:56,641 --> 00:01:58,950
how the puzzle system worked in 
masquerade,

33
00:01:58,951 --> 00:01:59,784
but there was a crude map that pointed 
to the exact place where the treasure 

34
00:02:03,481 --> 00:02:06,660
was hidden.
Williams relieved at this point told him

35
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,790
that he was right and said,
go dig it up.

36
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:12,150
The puzzle of masquerade is completely 
unique.

37
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:13,043
Williams invented it himself so that 
theoretically anyone of any age could 

38
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:18,360
figure it out.
Here's how it works.

39
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,583
Every page feature is at intricately 
designed picture surrounded by an order 

40
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,533
with a phrase.
The trick was to identify every living 

41
00:02:27,631 --> 00:02:32,370
creature in the frame and trace a line 
from its left I through its lefthand.

42
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,410
It's right,
I threw its right hand,

43
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:37,290
it's left,
I threw its left foot and it's right,

44
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:38,700
it's right foot.

45
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:39,863
These lines would point to letters and 
the border that could be anjem tumbled 

46
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:43,583
into a word in this case burden.
If you follow this pattern for all 15 

47
00:02:48,061 --> 00:02:48,894
pages,
you'd end up with a master phrase that 

48
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:51,504
goes like this.
Catherine's long finger overshadows 

49
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:57,780
birth,
buried yellow ambulant midday points.

50
00:02:57,781 --> 00:03:00,100
The Hour.
In light of equinox,

51
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:01,103
look to figure out what this means.
You have to take the first letter from 

52
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:06,670
each pages word or words and string them
together.

53
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:10,570
If you do that,
you get close by and that's it.

54
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:14,680
MTL refers to the town of mtl about an 
hour north of London,

55
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:15,723
and Catherine's long finger refers to 
the tall cross that commemorates 

56
00:03:18,101 --> 00:03:20,560
Katherine of Aragon,
first wife of King Henry,

57
00:03:20,561 --> 00:03:21,394
the eighth,
located in Mtl Park at noon on the 

58
00:03:23,771 --> 00:03:24,604
equinox.
The Sun projects a shadow of that cross 

59
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:27,813
onto a specific spot in the grass.
That's where Williams hit the golden 

60
00:03:31,421 --> 00:03:32,254
hair.

61
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,440
No,
I never found it,

62
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:50,243
and that's how kit Williams,
masquerade golden hair was finally 

63
00:03:53,221 --> 00:03:56,490
found,
except there's a problem.

64
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,940
There is no Ken Thomas,
you see,

65
00:03:59,941 --> 00:04:00,774
six years after the nationwide search 
was over the Sunday Times in Britain 

66
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:05,003
with the help of a local paper and Mtl 
discovered that Ken Thomas was actually 

67
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:09,653
a pseudonym for duke called Thompson,
who was the business partner of a man 

68
00:04:13,741 --> 00:04:17,160
named John Guard,
who at the time of masquerade was living

69
00:04:17,161 --> 00:04:20,190
with Kit Williams ex-girlfriend,
Veronica Robertson.

70
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,593
Robertson had been to [inaudible] park 
with Williams on a couple of occasions 

71
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,540
and guests that might've had the prize,
their garden.

72
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:30,660
Thompson middle detected the whole area 
dug holes,

73
00:04:30,661 --> 00:04:31,494
but he couldn't find it.
It was only after they saw were two 

74
00:04:34,081 --> 00:04:36,720
physics teachers who had actually solve 
the puzzle,

75
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:40,320
had been digging that they were able to 
snatch the hair for themselves.

76
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:42,660
By the time everyone found out about 
this scandal,

77
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:43,523
Thompson had already used the hair to 
start a video game company called hair 

78
00:04:47,191 --> 00:04:47,940
soft.

79
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:48,773
Its flagship title.
Hair razor was a puzzle game that 

80
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:52,374
promise the real golden hair to the 
winter game is pretty much 

81
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:58,560
incomprehensible in hilarious video on 
hair racer,

82
00:04:58,561 --> 00:04:59,394
comedian stuart ash,
and details why it's probably 

83
00:05:01,441 --> 00:05:03,750
unsolvable.
I'll leave a link to it below.

84
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,673
Nevertheless,
by the time that the expo say on 

85
00:05:06,061 --> 00:05:06,894
masquerade came out in [inaudible] 88,
the company had gone bankrupt and the 

86
00:05:10,411 --> 00:05:15,360
golden hair was sold by Southerby's at 
auction for 32,000

87
00:05:15,361 --> 00:05:16,194
pounds.
No one knows who bought it though the 

88
00:05:18,331 --> 00:05:19,164
BBC did track it down for a documentary 
on Williams in 2009 after which it went 

89
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:27,270
back to its owners to live in secrecy.
Once again,

90
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:28,950
nice.
Think she again,

91
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:30,780
never,
ever say that again.

92
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:35,930
Masquerade launched a new genre of 
armchair treasure hunts like forest fens

93
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:39,870
million dollar chest of antiques,
hiding somewhere in the rocky mountains,

94
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:40,913
still unsolved,
and our love for hidden treasure is 

95
00:05:42,721 --> 00:05:43,554
clear in the popularity of books like 
the Davinci Code or games like pokemon 

96
00:05:47,731 --> 00:05:51,450
go or in escape rooms which have 
flourished across the world.

97
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,980
It's just fun to solve a puzzle and go 
searching for treasure.

98
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:57,163
Still a declaration of independence.
Don't steal the declaration of 

99
00:06:03,471 --> 00:06:04,304
independence.

100
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,793
One of the questions that I get asked 
all the time is what kind of program do 

101
00:06:13,011 --> 00:06:13,844
I use to put these videos together?
I use final cut pro 10 tate at the nerd 

102
00:06:17,361 --> 00:06:21,950
writer and there was actually a little 
bit of a hubbub when 10 came out because

103
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:25,570
apple completely redesigned the program 
from the previous version.

104
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:26,413
Final cut pro seven and editing tool 
that I had used for over 10 years was 

105
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:31,243
gone and it sucked,
but eventually I learned how to use 

106
00:06:33,381 --> 00:06:35,690
final cut pro 10 by watching a bunch of 
youtube videos.

107
00:06:35,691 --> 00:06:36,524
But what I really wish I had with 
something like today's sponsor 

108
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:39,913
skillshare.
Skillshare is an online learning 

109

animation,

111
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,400
web development,
and final cut pro 10,

112
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:50,743
all the classes are professional and 
understandable and follow a clear 

113

115
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:02,540
but the first 500 people to sign up 
using the link below in the description,

116
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,673
get their first two months for free,
and those two months you can easily 

117
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:07,634
learn final cut pro or after effects any
kind of skill that you might need to 

118
00:07:10,371 --> 00:07:11,870
start a new hobby or business.

119
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:14,150
Definitely check it out guys.
It's a really great program.

120
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,560
Thanks again.
I'll see you next time.
