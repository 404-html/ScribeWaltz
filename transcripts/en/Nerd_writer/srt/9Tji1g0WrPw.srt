1
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:04,583
Probably no surprise that Donald Trump 
has been the subject of over 2100 CNN 

2
00:00:09,121 --> 00:00:13,080
reports since he announced his candidacy
for president on June 16th.

3
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:14,363
Okay.
Maybe 10,

4
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:15,303
2100 is a little bit surprising,
but the basic calculus is something I 

5
00:00:18,181 --> 00:00:22,350
think everyone cynically understands.
Trump gets ratings.

6
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:23,453
The news carries a little less obvious 
is that trump's high poll numbers are 

7
00:00:28,021 --> 00:00:31,500
actually a result of his outside 
coverage in the media.

8
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:32,603
Political science professor John Sides 
has produced a number of handicrafts 

9
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:36,383
that show the correlation between 
trump's share of coverage versus his 

10
00:00:39,571 --> 00:00:42,300
poll numbers and it's pretty conclusive.
What's more,

11
00:00:42,301 --> 00:00:45,270
if you graph all the job candidates,
polling numbers,

12
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,070
verse their share of coverage,
you get a correlation of point nine six,

13
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:52,740
close to a straight line as I've ever 
seen.

14
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,850
Of course you could say causation moves 
the other way here.

15
00:00:56,851 --> 00:01:00,510
That whole numbers drive coverage and in
some way they do.

16
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:01,733
Only news coverage usually comes first.
People hear a lot about a candidate 

17
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:09,750
research that can they identify in the 
same way that you do when you hear a pop

18
00:01:09,751 --> 00:01:12,270
song on the radio over and over and over
again,

19
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:19,680
and that exposure ultimately means 
they're more likely to give that name to

20
00:01:19,681 --> 00:01:20,514
pollsters.
The news then reports more on the top 

21
00:01:23,311 --> 00:01:25,380
candidates,
which means even more coverage,

22
00:01:25,381 --> 00:01:26,214
which means even higher polling and it 
becomes a cycle that perpetuates itself 

23
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,100
until the top dog makes a mistake.

24
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:35,270
It's three agencies of government when I
get there that are gone,

25
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:39,100
commerce education and the uh,
uh,

26
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,140
what's the third one there?

27
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:44,210
Or a new fresh face,
steal some attention away.

28
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:47,420
Women all over this country heard very 
clearly what Mr Trump said.

29
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,870
The problem is that trump's mistakes are
often so inflammatory,

30
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:53,300
newsmaking that they worked to his 
advantage,

31
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:57,760
and new fresh faces are the ones that 
trump attacks the hardest,

32
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:00,020
listened to her for more than five 
minutes straight.

33
00:02:00,021 --> 00:02:02,210
You get a headache.
Twenty 100 news stories later.

34
00:02:02,211 --> 00:02:05,570
And here we are.
We know why the news works like this.

35
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:09,230
Less ratings mean less ad revenue means 
less.

36
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:12,890
Profit means lower stock prices means 
fewer investors,

37
00:02:12,891 --> 00:02:17,150
means layoffs in America who indeed in 
the global economy,

38
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,360
everything always has to grow the news,
especially Cable News,

39
00:02:22,461 --> 00:02:25,970
has a vague interest in keeping its 
dependence on capitalists.

40
00:02:25,971 --> 00:02:26,804
Incentives under wraps,
even though everyone knows that ratings 

41
00:02:29,711 --> 00:02:30,544
to a large part determined the news,
news organizations have to tout their 

42
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:38,450
journalistic integrity,
even if it's only a formality and this.

43
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:39,283
This might just be the gift that Donald 
Trump is giving to all of us more than 

44
00:02:44,191 --> 00:02:45,024
anything I can remember.
The trump phenomenon strips away the 

45
00:02:47,731 --> 00:02:52,080
false righteousness of the news media.
When trump does something outrageous,

46
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:57,110
CNN doesn't cover it by choice,
but because they are forced to do so,

47
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,373
the trump phenomenon strips away the 
false righteousness of politicians to 

48
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:06,310
trump has cooperated political language 
and employed it to such a ridiculous and

49
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:10,510
shameless degree that it's emptiness is 
laid totally bare,

50
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,583
and lastly,
trump strips away the false 

51
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,170
righteousness of us,
the American public.

52
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:22,590
The second gop debate was the highest 
rated program in the history of CNN.

53
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,970
CNN is forced to cover trump because we 
forced them.

54
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:28,993
Why?
When we put on something with Jeb Bush 

55
00:03:30,681 --> 00:03:34,010
talking about the economy or Scott 
Walker talking about labor unions,

56
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,360
why doesn't anybody watched that?

57
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:40,660
It's in our nature to gravitate toward 
confirmation bias and sensationalism.

58
00:03:40,661 --> 00:03:45,010
It takes a force of will to consume 
media that may be bored,

59
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:48,040
but crucial for making intelligent 
political choices,

60
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,520
and in large part,
it's a mental muscle that most of us,

61
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,840
myself often included,
don't want to exercise.

62
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,713
Donald trump exists at the nexus of all 
these things and his invocation of all 

63
00:04:00,191 --> 00:04:01,024
three is I think an important lesson.
The news media politicians and the 

64
00:04:05,441 --> 00:04:10,441
general public are all responsible for 
the existence of Donald Trump and no one

65
00:04:11,321 --> 00:04:14,560
of these things is going to change 
drastically overnight,

66
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,023
but if all of them move just a little 
bit in the right direction toward 

67
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,820
integrity,
honesty,

68
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:26,380
and engagement respectively,
the difference could be substantial.

69
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,873
We know that the news media is biased 
and politicians talk bullshit and the 

70
00:04:31,721 --> 00:04:35,800
news and the politicians know,
we know it still.

71
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:40,660
They go through the formalities.
It is exactly formalities like this that

72
00:04:40,661 --> 00:04:43,780
can keep the system alive longer than it
needs to be.

73
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:45,543
So maybe we need someone like Donald 
Trump to pull down that last layer of 

74
00:04:53,141 --> 00:04:55,330
credibility.
How are you going to create jobs in this

75
00:04:55,331 --> 00:04:58,270
country?
I'm just going to do it.

76
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,820
Hey everybody.
Thanks for watching.

77
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:08,030
We heard about $950 on the patron,
which is $50 away from the big goal of a

78
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,290
thousand dollars that starts to make 
this financially feasible for me.

79
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:16,380
So if you like the nerd writer have you,
there's something you don't think you're

80
00:05:16,381 --> 00:05:18,000
seeing somewhere else on youtube or the 
Internet.

81
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:19,043
Pledge a little bit money for the 
project and we can do a lot of more 

82
00:05:21,931 --> 00:05:24,180
stuff.
There's no more stickers or mugs left,

83
00:05:24,181 --> 00:05:26,880
but I want to order some more swag,
maybe some more mugs,

84
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:31,350
but I'd like to hear what you would like
of nerd writer swag and that universal.

85
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:34,560
Let me know in the comments and we'll 
we'll get some and put them up.

86
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:38,550
Thank you so much for watching and I 
will see you guys next Wednesday.
