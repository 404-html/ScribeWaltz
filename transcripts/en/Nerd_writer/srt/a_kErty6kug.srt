1
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:05,690
I think it's worth talking a little bit 
about Rosetta scientists,

2
00:00:05,691 --> 00:00:07,340
Matt Taylor,
now infamous.

3
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:08,174
Sure.
Sort of what we do here at the nerd 

4
00:00:09,281 --> 00:00:11,090
writer talk about morality,
things like that,

5
00:00:11,091 --> 00:00:11,924
but if you think you've heard everything
you ever want to hear about this 

6
00:00:14,391 --> 00:00:16,550
subject,
I'll give you a chance to get out now.

7
00:00:16,551 --> 00:00:19,460
Here's an awesome video of a dog trying 
to get a tater tot.

8
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:20,623
I'll see you some other time.
When the sand pepper thing happened a 

9
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:24,403
few weeks ago,
I was drawn to look at it from an 

10
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:26,353
anthropological perspective,
though I wholeheartedly agreed with the 

11
00:00:28,911 --> 00:00:29,744
criticism of pepper.
It was the form and impact of the 

12
00:00:32,781 --> 00:00:36,560
response that fascinated me most in the 
wake of shirk gate.

13
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:40,310
I just found myself wanting to know who 
was right and why.

14
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,173
This is an important exercise,
I think because it took all of three 

15
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:44,084
Internet seconds for arguments about 
this to devolve into Straw man attacks 

16
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:48,470
and character assassinations.

17
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:51,650
Soon as is so often the case in public 
discourse,

18
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:54,770
everybody loses.
The people who were criticizing Taylor's

19
00:00:54,771 --> 00:00:55,604
choice of shirt said essentially that 
images like these conserve to dissuade 

20
00:00:59,331 --> 00:01:02,270
girls who might otherwise go into stem,
science,

21
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:03,200
technology,
engineering,

22
00:01:03,201 --> 00:01:07,010
and math fields,
because images like these perpetuate the

23
00:01:07,011 --> 00:01:10,160
cultural stereotype that stem is a boys 
club,

24
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:11,083
just not something that girls do or as 
Mike over at idea channel set on his 

25
00:01:15,231 --> 00:01:16,064
tumbler.
The shirt was like the coloring on a 

26
00:01:17,391 --> 00:01:19,070
poisonous frog.
It's screams.

27
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,083
Stay away to some maybe lots of people,
particularly when Mike wrote about this 

28
00:01:24,801 --> 00:01:26,630
in response to a tumbler.
Ask that said,

29
00:01:26,631 --> 00:01:27,464
simply kill yourself.
Not the most articulate way to advance 

30
00:01:30,711 --> 00:01:31,544
your argument,
but of course hate is a huge part of 

31
00:01:33,981 --> 00:01:37,340
controversies like these.
Not only for those who speak out against

32
00:01:37,341 --> 00:01:38,174
perceived wrongs,
but even those who support those who 

33
00:01:40,941 --> 00:01:41,360
speak out.

34
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,193
On the slightly more articulate side,
you have commentators like the mayor of 

35
00:01:45,471 --> 00:01:46,304
London,
Boris Johnson who said there must be 

36
00:01:48,021 --> 00:01:48,854
room in our world for centricity.
Even if it offends the prudes and room 

37
00:01:53,091 --> 00:01:56,930
for the vague other worldliness that 
often goes with genius,

38
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,710
and then you have women across social 
media who said they weren't in the least

39
00:02:00,711 --> 00:02:04,130
bit offended by tailored shirt and after
all it's just a shirt,

40
00:02:04,131 --> 00:02:04,941
right?
Movies,

41
00:02:04,941 --> 00:02:06,110
TV,
magazines,

42
00:02:06,111 --> 00:02:10,130
billboards are filled with exploitative 
images of female sexuality.

43
00:02:10,131 --> 00:02:10,964
Help Kim Kardashians probably did more 
to damage young girls image of 

44
00:02:13,521 --> 00:02:14,900
themselves.
Then the rest combined.

45
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:19,700
Why are we crucifying Matt Taylor when 
everyone support something or other that

46
00:02:19,701 --> 00:02:24,140
has some kind of misogynistic undertone 
when none of us are blameless.

47
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:26,810
First off,
we're not crucifying Matt Taylor.

48
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:27,703
We're trying to show how wearing a shirt
like that on a global webcast might add 

49
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:33,470
to a culture of denigration of women.

50
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:34,573
Second,
it doesn't really matter if some women 

51
00:02:36,141 --> 00:02:40,040
aren't offended by Taylor shirt.
What matters are facts,

52
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:40,933
statistics like these statistics that 
show women earn 60 percent of all 

53
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:48,880
graduate degrees yet comprise less than 
25 percent of the stem fields.

54
00:02:48,881 --> 00:02:49,714
Statistics that show women are far less 
likely to be published in peer reviewed 

55
00:02:53,271 --> 00:02:57,530
scientific journals and just is unlikely
to be cited when they are published.

56
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:01,060
Maybe this is because women just like 
science as much as men,

57
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:02,860
and if you're operating on that 
assumption,

58
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:03,723
there's little I can tell you saved to 
suggest that maybe your assumptions are 

59
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:10,540
following from cultural norms,
so invisible.

60
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:15,250
They seem like insights about gender.
Really the strongest emotion I'm feeling

61
00:03:15,251 --> 00:03:18,790
from the Internet in the wake of shirt 
gate is annoyance.

62
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:19,803
Why do we have to cheapen this 
miraculous achievement of science and 

63
00:03:22,021 --> 00:03:26,890
humankind with petty bickering about one
man's stupid fashion choices,

64
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:30,400
and I think this gets to the beating 
heart of the matter.

65
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:33,760
The dirty secret about sexism,
racism,

66
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:37,360
homophobia,
prejudice is that it's pleasurable,

67
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,620
it's pleasurable to assert your 
dominance within a hierarchy.

68
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:42,903
You create splittable in the same way 
that winning at a sporting event is 

69
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:46,624
pleasurable.
The feeling of being a winner of 

70
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:51,370
bettering someone.
So when we think about issues like this,

71
00:03:51,371 --> 00:03:55,450
we have to keep in mind that what we're 
talking about is people's pleasure about

72
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,060
taking it away from them rightly so.
Yet,

73
00:03:58,061 --> 00:04:01,210
it will come as no surprise that there 
is reluctant to let it go here,

74
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,480
as in any other instance of 
gratification in the active sense,

75
00:04:04,481 --> 00:04:07,540
prejudice is easy to condemn,
but in the passive sense,

76
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:08,403
it's far more insidious to tell 
otherwise kind and good hearted people 

77
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:15,490
that by doing nothing at all,
they're perpetuating bigotry,

78
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,473
discrimination,
intolerance to require them to think 

79
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,500
about their actions and inactions may 
feel incredibly annoying.

80
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,290
That's what it is to take someone's 
pleasure away,

81
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,440
pleasure that's so normalized,
so baked into our lives.

82
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:32,890
It's removal feels a lot like paint.
I for one,

83
00:04:32,891 --> 00:04:37,000
think it's possible to hold two lines of
thought in the mind at once to marvel at

84
00:04:37,001 --> 00:04:37,834
the unbelievable magic of the Rosetta 
mission and to lament the real 

85
00:04:41,171 --> 00:04:42,004
contribution.
However small of one man's shirt on a 

86
00:04:44,381 --> 00:04:45,214
community of women who began at a loss,
so the next time you feel annoyed at 

87
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:53,320
feminists or social justice warriors 
were Mike from idea channel.

88
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:58,830
Take 60 seconds to think about whether 
in fact you feel annoyed or threatened.

89
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,330
If it's the latter,
ask yourself,

90
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:07,200
what is it that I'm in danger of losing?
Hey everybody.

91
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,410
As I said at the beginning of the video,
this is sort of what we do here.

92
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:15,670
We think about moral issues,
try to figure out what side we come out,

93
00:05:15,671 --> 00:05:16,504
and if we can't do that,
we just try to get a better 

94
00:05:18,491 --> 00:05:20,770
understanding of what the issue actually
is.

95
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:24,460
So thanks for watching.
Make sure to follow me on twitter if you

96

haven't already,
I'll leave the link in the description 

97
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,510
