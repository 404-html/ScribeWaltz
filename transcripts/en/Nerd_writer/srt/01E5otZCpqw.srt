1
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:26,253
When I write these film analysis,
I usually start by watching the film 

2
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:33,130
with a notepad and writing down all the 
things I think are interesting.

3
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:36,790
When I started watching long car wise in
the mood for love,

4
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:37,983
the first thing I wrote was five minutes
in and every shot is a frame within a 

5
00:00:43,421 --> 00:00:44,254
frame,
meaning that every single shot feature 

6
00:00:46,301 --> 00:00:50,770
characters not only framed by the 
rectangle of the film itself,

7
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,633
but by smaller internal shapes as well,
and this is the visual technique that 

8
00:00:55,631 --> 00:00:56,464
filmmakers have used for decades.
My favorite example is the great last 

9
00:01:00,251 --> 00:01:03,250
shot and John Ford's masterpiece,
the searchers,

10
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:08,080
but seldom is it used so ubiquitously as
the film went on.

11
00:01:08,081 --> 00:01:12,040
I had to cross out five from my little 
note and change it to six,

12
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,300
seven,
nine.

13
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:14,403
It wasn't until minute 12 that I saw the
first shot without some foreground 

14
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:18,940
obstruction.
This shot,

15
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:22,060
which crucially doesn't feature either 
of the two main characters,

16
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,313
but wait,
I'm getting ahead of myself in the mood 

17
00:01:24,881 --> 00:01:25,714
for love is the story of two married 
couples who happened to rent rooms in 

18
00:01:29,321 --> 00:01:32,710
the adjacent homes of older couples in 
19 sixties.

19
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:33,543
Hong Kong.
The film focuses on the husband of one 

20
00:01:35,681 --> 00:01:38,410
couple Mr Chow and the wife of the other
Mrs.

21
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,333
Chan,
as they both gradually discover that 

22
00:01:41,081 --> 00:01:41,914
their spouses are cheating on them with 
each other and then how those two 

23
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:49,300
innocent victims of infidelity come 
together to deal with the pain of that.

24
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,193
The film manages to be unsentimental 
with its subject matter while couching 

25
00:01:53,891 --> 00:01:57,310
the events in sumptuous painterly 
cinematography.

26
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:01,330
The narrative skips and jumps forward 
through time at an erratic speed,

27
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:02,463
as one might recall.
The story in memory and the viewer is 

28
00:02:05,051 --> 00:02:09,700
often left initially confused as to how 
much time has passed between scenes.

29
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:12,730
This prompts a strong engagement with 
the film,

30
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,593
a need to pay attention,
but it also reflects how the film was 

31
00:02:16,661 --> 00:02:17,494
made.
There was a little more than an outline 

32
00:02:18,881 --> 00:02:23,440
when long car why and his crew began 
filming a process that took a long,

33
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:24,573
15 months in which the script and the 
individual scenes were written on the 

34
00:02:28,361 --> 00:02:31,390
fly by the director and the actors 
together.

35
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,330
Which is surprising because watching the
film,

36
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:35,223
you can't help but feel that you're in 
the hands of somebody in complete 

37
00:02:38,351 --> 00:02:39,184
control visually and emotionally.
In the mood for love is fully 

38
00:02:42,821 --> 00:02:43,654
consistent,
the film is so self contained that it 

39
00:02:45,581 --> 00:02:46,414
only features a handful of locations 
each filmed from the same angle so that 

40
00:02:51,131 --> 00:02:56,131
you experience a kind of circular effect
of returning again and again to the same

41
00:02:56,561 --> 00:02:59,830
things.
This technique far from feeling sluggish

42
00:02:59,831 --> 00:03:04,330
or repetitive,
instead isolates against fixed backwards

43
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,030
the things that actually are changing in
the film,

44
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:08,223
the inner lives of the two leads and for
the most part these inner lives are 

45
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:12,724
explored worthless.
The real action of this movie is in 

46
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:19,720
posture glances,
touches by restricting the language.

47
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:20,583
One car.
Why echoes the restriction of action 

48
00:03:23,201 --> 00:03:26,340
that plagues Mr.
Chow and Mrs Chan in 19 sixties,

49
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,213
Hong Kong,
where they are under constant threat of 

50
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:30,183
gossip,
kind of surveillance from their 

51
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:36,170
landlords and the community at large,
the CCC,

52
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,313
but this is one reason why everything is
doubly framed by placing objects in the 

53
00:03:44,981 --> 00:03:45,580
foreground.

54
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:49,450
The director enhances the feeling that 
the characters have of being observed,

55
00:03:49,451 --> 00:03:54,451
not to mention our own feelings of being
observers observed and observing,

56
00:03:54,761 --> 00:03:58,390
seen and being seen what we desire from 
others,

57
00:03:58,391 --> 00:03:59,224
what others desire from us.
These are major themes of in the mood 

58
00:04:02,411 --> 00:04:03,244
for love.
I think the most extraordinary element 

59
00:04:05,351 --> 00:04:06,184
of this film is what's introduced just 
after the two main characters admit to 

60
00:04:10,121 --> 00:04:10,954
each other that their spouses are 
cheating instead of confronting the 

61
00:04:14,141 --> 00:04:18,850
situation head on,
their primary goal becomes to understand

62
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:19,743
exactly how it happened,
so we get this incredible scene where 

63
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,333
they reenact the seduction of their 
spouses in which each attempt to embody 

64
00:04:28,871 --> 00:04:29,704
the spouse of the other while being 
coached by the other on what they think 

65
00:04:33,461 --> 00:04:38,461
the spouse really would or wouldn't do.
This makes for a really complex but also

66
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,133
kind of perverse interplay,
though the film aggressively focuses on 

67
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:45,550
only Mr.

68
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,473
Chow and Mrs Chan to the point of never 
even showing the faces of their spouses 

69
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:54,580
were always aware that for people not to
are involved here,

70
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:59,910
but it's not for real people.
It's two people and two phantoms.

71
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:04,570
I think of what's being asked of Chow 
and Chan in the seduction scene.

72
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,360
In the guise of understanding what 
happened.

73
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:08,403
Each victim attempts to seduce their own
spouse in the form of the other's 

74
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:14,830
spouse.
A task.

75
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:15,843
It has to be doomed from the start 
because the fact of the affair itself 

76
00:05:19,091 --> 00:05:19,924
means that neither child nor chan can 
any longer elicit that kind of desire 

77
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:28,240
that they're trying to recreate.
You could describe this course of action

78
00:05:28,241 --> 00:05:29,074
as masochistic and one car.
Why lets us feel this by not making it 

79
00:05:33,191 --> 00:05:34,024
obvious when Mr Chow or Mrs Chan are 
being themselves or being each other's 

80
00:05:37,981 --> 00:05:40,570
spouses often were admitted into the 
scene,

81
00:05:40,571 --> 00:05:41,404
interpreting it one way before the 
reality or perhaps the unreality of the 

82
00:05:45,221 --> 00:05:47,650
moment hits us like a gut punch,

83
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:55,310
but because each player is constantly 
coaching the other,

84
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:56,383
they're able to construct fantasy in 
which they control their own betrayal 

85
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:06,080
and by never consummating their own 
butting love for each other.

86
00:06:06,081 --> 00:06:06,914
Mr.
Chow and Mrs Chan can infinitely delay 

87
00:06:09,391 --> 00:06:12,860
the moment in which they have to see 
things as they really are.

88
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:13,813
They can stay in their fantasy.
It's a tragic and twisted state of 

89
00:06:17,451 --> 00:06:18,284
affairs and one car wide has said that 
if Tony Young and Maggie Chung weren't 

90
00:06:21,921 --> 00:06:22,754
such beautiful actors,
the darkness at the center of their 

91
00:06:25,521 --> 00:06:28,820
characters and their fantasy would be 
obvious.

92
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:29,863
Of course they can't keep it up forever 
and in the scene where Mr Chow finally 

93
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:38,750
admits his love for Mrs Chin,
most of the fantasy comes crumbling down

94
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:42,050
as he says,
they are like their spouses,

95
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:45,260
which means that the thing they've been 
refusing to see,

96
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,183
their own lack,
that they've ceased to be an object of 

97
00:06:48,891 --> 00:06:49,724
love for their loved one rushes into 
consciousness like a wave and yet still 

98
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:59,570
they don't act on it,
can only let the brutal truth in so much

99
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:01,040
in order to survive.

100
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,130
In order to move forward,
Mr.

101
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:07,280
Chow and Mrs Chan doom themselves to 
missed connections.

102
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,173
This is why at the end,
the film jumps forward to see them just 

103
00:07:10,941 --> 00:07:14,210
missing each other twice,
just missing each other.

104
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,073
The mere possibility of a connection.
The connection itself is what sustains 

105
00:07:19,341 --> 00:07:20,174
them.
Now,

106
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:24,350
everybody lives within fantasy within 
frames.

107
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:28,730
Sometimes the frames are made by us.
Sometimes they're made by others.

108
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:32,780
Sometimes we need to believe that those 
made by us are made by others,

109
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:33,913
but whatever the case,
there is no way out of the frame when 

110
00:07:37,011 --> 00:07:40,220
fantasies rupture or crack or break down
completely.

111
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:45,050
That's trauma,
like living temporarily in a storm,

112
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:48,740
one car wise in the mood for love is a 
gorgeous,

113
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,873
quiet and painful exploration of what 
happens when the fantasy you create for 

114
00:07:54,261 --> 00:07:55,094
yourself is a perverse one when it only 
serves to keep you from confronting the 

115
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:00,104
pain and it was created to avoid.
And the reason the film is so 

116
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:10,090
heartbreaking is because this kind of 
perversity is really quite common to all

117
00:08:14,511 --> 00:08:15,344
of this.

118
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,630
Hey everybody,
thank you so much for watching.

119
