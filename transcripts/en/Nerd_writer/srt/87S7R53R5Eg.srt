1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:02,310
Okay,
whoever put me on reddit out there,

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:03,593
you know I got a bone to pick with you 
that the plan was to get subscribers at 

3
00:00:07,711 --> 00:00:10,710
a torturously slow incremental,
right over a period of decades.

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,240
That was the plan.
God,

5
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:15,390
some people,
you know what all I can say to you,

6
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:20,660
it's coffee on a Tuesday and Vlog 42,
so there's a feeling I sometimes get.

7
00:00:30,511 --> 00:00:32,310
Maybe you get it to.
That happens.

8
00:00:32,311 --> 00:00:35,430
For example,
when I come around a corner and all of a

9
00:00:35,431 --> 00:00:36,264
sudden I'm confronted by a sunset or at 
that moment in a movie when everything 

10
00:00:39,661 --> 00:00:40,494
just falls into place,
hairs stand up on the back of my neck 

11
00:00:42,901 --> 00:00:44,720
and it chill,
runs down my shoulders,

12
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:47,280
times it freezes me in place,
blanks my mind,

13
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:49,650
and the feeling I have is one of 
astonishment.

14
00:00:49,651 --> 00:00:52,020
And Jimmy Stewart,
my favorite actor,

15
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:53,100
describes it like this.

16
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:58,220
Creating moments in movies.
This I think is the important thing.

17
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:04,560
Nobody knows exactly how it happened.

18
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:06,550
Turns out there's a name for this 
feeling.

19
00:01:06,551 --> 00:01:10,180
It's called freezer.
It's a French word for cold chill,

20
00:01:10,181 --> 00:01:12,490
but really there is no English 
equivalent in French.

21
00:01:12,491 --> 00:01:14,260
It's pronounced like this free zone.

22
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:21,460
You can have free song with a person,
someone you're attracted to,

23
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:22,323
and if I had to guess,
it probably happens most frequently in 

24
00:01:24,131 --> 00:01:25,780
that nervous,
flirtatious,

25
00:01:25,781 --> 00:01:29,860
almost unbearable time before any 
feelings are expressed outright.

26
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:30,723
Okay,
so have you ever spent a subway ride or 

27
00:01:31,621 --> 00:01:32,454
a bus ride?
Sort of on off looking at someone from 

28
00:01:33,911 --> 00:01:35,740
across the train,
someone who is beautiful,

29
00:01:35,741 --> 00:01:38,110
someone who strikes you and who you 
stupidly fall in love with,

30
00:01:38,111 --> 00:01:40,330
with the 10 minutes it takes to get from
30 Fourth Street to Union Square.

31
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,193
You look at them as they look away and 
then you can feel their eyes on you as 

32
00:01:43,541 --> 00:01:44,374
you look away,
and then you sort of just wait there 

33
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:48,820
until you think it's safe to know this.
I contacted freezing,

34
00:01:48,821 --> 00:01:49,630
freezing,
freezing.

35
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:51,910
Maybe it's just me.
Whatever triggers it.

36
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:55,750
We all get these feelings of freedom.
One of the most common sources is music.

37
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:56,613
A study published last year in nature.
Neuroscience showed that the moment in 

38
00:01:59,081 --> 00:02:01,360
your favorite song when you experienced 
that chill,

39
00:02:01,361 --> 00:02:02,194
that feeling of free zone coincides with
the release of the neurotransmitter 

40
00:02:05,321 --> 00:02:06,154
dopamine into your brain opening.
Makes you feel good and it's commonly 

41
00:02:08,951 --> 00:02:09,784
released to reinforce or motivate 
biologically significant activity like 

42
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,713
eating or sex,
suggesting that for some reason unknown 

43
00:02:16,691 --> 00:02:17,524
to us,
music is inextricably linked to our 

44
00:02:19,811 --> 00:02:22,360
deepest reward systems,
but there's something else.

45
00:02:22,361 --> 00:02:23,194
See,
I also get a feeling of free when 

46
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,440
overwhelmed by a sad song.
It's a chill,

47
00:02:26,441 --> 00:02:27,274
but a kind of consoling David here on a 
professor at Ohio State University and 

48
00:02:30,851 --> 00:02:33,940
who runs the cognitive and systematic 
musicology laboratory.

49
00:02:33,941 --> 00:02:36,190
Awesome name has this to say about Sam

50
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,550
when a person is in a sad state,
uh,

51
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:40,703
uh,
this hormone called Prolactin is 

52
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:45,960
released and it has a psychological 
effect,

53
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:46,863
a consoling psychological effect.
It's as though the music has put them 

54
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:50,754
into a kind of sham state of sadness.
And the body has responded by releasing 

55
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,160
this hormone called Prolactin.
And it's,

56
00:03:00,161 --> 00:03:00,994
it's like mother nature sort of wrapping
our arms around you and consoling you 

57
00:03:04,091 --> 00:03:06,780
and saying there are there.
Everything's Okay and you have this kind

58
00:03:06,781 --> 00:03:07,900
of warm,
fuzzy feeling.

59
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,980
Extremely interesting.

60
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:09,993
But following from that,
I want to pick up on an earlier point 

61
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:12,573
biologically,
we really don't know why music affects 

62
00:03:14,231 --> 00:03:16,810
us so powerfully.
White gives us those feelings of Friesen

63
00:03:16,811 --> 00:03:17,644
or constellation or combination of both,
but psychologically I think that music 

64
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:21,903
is embedded in each one of us uniquely 
strong along our memories in the way 

65
00:03:27,281 --> 00:03:29,950
that Christmas lights are strung along a
tree branch.

66
00:03:29,951 --> 00:03:32,860
To me,
music is the raw or of beauty.

67
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,370
It goes deeper and affects them more 
potent emotional response than any other

68
00:03:36,371 --> 00:03:37,750
art form.
It's why when people ask,

69
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:38,584
I say that the Beatles or the artists of
any medium that have had the largest 

70
00:03:41,861 --> 00:03:43,750
single influence on me on February 
fourth,

71
00:03:43,751 --> 00:03:44,584
2008,
NASA transmitted a song for the first 

72
00:03:46,871 --> 00:03:47,704
time into deep space,
the Beatles across the universe in the 

73
00:03:50,321 --> 00:03:55,240
direction of the star Polaris,
431 light years from Earth.

74
00:03:55,241 --> 00:03:58,600
It's always been a sad song for me,
if not for its swelling,

75
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,750
drifting quality.
Then because it gets me thinking of John

76
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:02,583
Lennon and d,
The idea of melodies like that dancing 

77
00:04:04,121 --> 00:04:04,954
out into a silent and unfeeling universe
gives me such a chill and then such a 

78
00:04:09,701 --> 00:04:10,534
warmth that I do have the feeling of 
being wrapped in a blanket and I'm 

79
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:17,080
consoled for a moment or a minute of my 
humanity.

80
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:24,260
Welcome to everybody who's new.
I'm so glad to have you.

81
00:04:24,261 --> 00:04:25,094
Really.
This is a good example of sort of what 

82
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:29,470
goes on here.
The vlog is a is a project of,

83
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,393
of learning,
but also of expression of trying to say 

84
00:04:31,761 --> 00:04:32,594
something a thoughtfully and precisely.
So on my channel page you can find 

85
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,800
social networks,
things,

86
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:40,790
twitter,
tumblr,

87
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:41,630
facebook,
things like that.

88
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:42,463
And seriously,
thank you to that person who put me on 

89
00:04:43,881 --> 00:04:47,240
Reddit.
I owe you a beer or 20,000.
