00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:00,923
Hi Everyone,
this is Evan pushback and it's my first 

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:04,410
video blog.

3
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:16,763
I think I'm gonna have to learn how to 
not look at myself in the picture so 

4
00:00:18,901 --> 00:00:20,400
much.
Uh,

5
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:22,620
I'm just drawn to my face.
I'm a writer,

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,080
a much like John Green of the vlog 
brothers.

7
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:26,520
Uh,
I am a nerdfighter to,

8
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:27,990
uh,
unlike John Green.

9
00:00:27,991 --> 00:00:29,250
However,
I'm not published.

10
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,920
I did it again.
I just looked at myself in the picture.

11
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,620
I can't help it.
Do I move my face down to the very,

12
00:00:34,621 --> 00:00:35,454
very corner of the screen.
I promise I will try not to look at it 

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,610
one more time for the rest of this 
video.

14
00:00:38,611 --> 00:00:39,444
I know I've been told by people that I 
do that when I talk to them on skype or 

15
00:00:41,371 --> 00:00:42,204
any other kind of video chat,
I'm trying to figure out what I should 

16
00:00:43,771 --> 00:00:44,604
do for my first flog a.
I had been thinking about a lot of 

17
00:00:46,681 --> 00:00:47,514
ideas.
I figured a good idea might be to start 

18
00:00:48,451 --> 00:00:49,940
with telling me a little about myself a 
little bit.

19
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,920
What I do and the reason that I wanted 
to start a blog in the first place.

20
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:54,240
Well,
my name is Evan Puschak.

21
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,450
That's who?
Then Shaq.

22
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,320
Um,
yeah,

23
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:00,660
my childhood was tough living in Los 
Angeles.

24
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:01,800
Like I said,
I'm a writer.

25
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:02,913
I write novels.
I studied film making in Boston for for 

26
00:01:05,251 --> 00:01:07,080
many,
many years now.

27
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,850
I don't do that anymore.
It's a couple reasons.

28
00:01:08,851 --> 00:01:10,170
I'm not still in the filmmaking 
industry.

29
00:01:10,171 --> 00:01:11,880
Um,
I still love the art of filmmaking.

30
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:14,580
A lot of my friends still do it and I 
encouraged them to be the best that they

31
00:01:14,581 --> 00:01:15,414
can edit.
Um,

32
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:16,373
and I still love talking about it wasn't
so much that I didn't like the business 

33
00:01:18,301 --> 00:01:19,680
side of the industry.
Electrical say,

34
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:20,723
Oh,
you got to be a bitch for this many 

35
00:01:20,971 --> 00:01:22,710
years getting coffee and so on,
so forth.

36
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,461
You know,
that's tough.

37
00:01:23,461 --> 00:01:24,840
But I didn't really mind that so much.

38
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,760
What am I did?
Was that film making is an art form that

39
00:01:26,761 --> 00:01:30,020
is enmeshed in money and you can't 
unmeasured.

40
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:31,380
Does that measure word?
I don't think so.

41
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,600
What it means is this is if you're 
really fast,

42
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,210
you can maybe maybe make for short films
a year.

43
00:01:36,211 --> 00:01:37,710
And I'm talking about conception from 
the,

44
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,930
from the writing process onto the final 
edit.

45
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,600
You maybe do four a year,
so if you're a and you sort of know that

46
00:01:42,601 --> 00:01:44,940
when you have an idea for a project,
it's like a vision inside of your head.

47
00:01:44,941 --> 00:01:48,180
It might be triggered by a song or a 
story or buy something that you say,

48
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,280
but it triggers in your head like a 
vision,

49
00:01:50,281 --> 00:01:51,114
like a dream.
And then the process of filmmaking from 

50
00:01:52,531 --> 00:01:55,170
writing to casting,
to filming to editing.

51
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:58,020
It's all sort of a process of the 
degradation of that first idea.

52
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:59,940
Now a lot of people like that.
A lot of people would say that it's sort

53
00:01:59,941 --> 00:02:00,774
of a maturation of an idea that happens 
in your head to something that is 

54
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,550
definitely going to be different,
but could,

55
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,750
could well be better.
Also,

56
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:07,584
a lot of people like the idea of working
together with a lot of people to make a 

57
00:02:09,691 --> 00:02:11,120
project.
Um,

58
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,033
you know,
because cooperation is the thing that 

59
00:02:13,621 --> 00:02:15,840
they get into it for now.
I like cooperation.

60
00:02:15,841 --> 00:02:18,600
Don't get me wrong in my life with my 
friends,

61
00:02:18,601 --> 00:02:20,220
with my family,
with the people that I love.

62
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:24,960
I am willing to cooperate with them on 
act of living on the process of living.

63
00:02:24,961 --> 00:02:25,794
I want you to help me and I'm going to 
help you and we're going to get along 

64
00:02:27,361 --> 00:02:28,194
together the best we can.
We're going to be the best people that 

65
00:02:29,311 --> 00:02:31,560
we can,
but when it comes to my art,

66
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:33,030
it's a whole different story.

67
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,090
I confess to being a fascist.
Now granted,

68
00:02:36,091 --> 00:02:37,950
I think that don't make it does require 
a dictator,

69
00:02:37,951 --> 00:02:40,200
benevolent dictator,
and I try to be in Neverland dictator.

70
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:44,070
It just still wasn't at the level of 
control that I needed for art.

71
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,660
You're saying all this at the risk of 
sounding pretentious,

72
00:02:45,661 --> 00:02:46,494
but I think that that risk is worth 
taking and I also think that potential 

73
00:02:48,761 --> 00:02:50,580
is a pretty ugly word.
When is that?

74
00:02:50,581 --> 00:02:52,030
I had sort of falling out with 
filmmaking.

75
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,913
I left that and over the process of a 
few months I sort of reevaluate what I 

76
00:02:54,961 --> 00:02:56,700
wanted and I realized that I didn't want
to be an artist.

77
00:02:56,701 --> 00:02:57,534
I didn't want to create,
but once they're a different art form 

78
00:02:59,321 --> 00:03:01,810
that would maybe suit me better.
So I tried writing first I tried,

79
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:02,813
you know,
writing short story and then I tried 

80
00:03:03,521 --> 00:03:04,354
writing a novella.
Finally I tried writing a novel just to 

81
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:07,054
see if I had the stamina to put that 
many words to paper that I did have the 

82
00:03:09,701 --> 00:03:10,534
stamina and that I loved it and also 
that it gave me the opportunity to 

83
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:16,210
cuddle my work and the way that I want 
to.

84
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:21,210
You can sort of coddle a sentence or 
paragraph in the in a way that you can't

85
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:24,790
with a,
a film shot for example.

86
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,010
So there we are.
So I went to Paris for the summer.

87
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:27,903
I wrote my first novel.
I'm revising it now and we get to the 

88
00:03:30,371 --> 00:03:34,180
reason why I am starting this blog 
because I'm as video editing,

89
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:37,600
but mostly because I see blogging as a 
good platform to get my word out there.

90
00:03:37,601 --> 00:03:38,434
Someone expressed to me.
It was actually a distant cousin who is 

91
00:03:40,151 --> 00:03:42,850
a writer.
He wrote an email to me and he said,

92
00:03:42,851 --> 00:03:43,684
you know,
the dilemma is being famous before 

93
00:03:46,451 --> 00:03:48,160
you're famous,
and I thought that was a really good way

94
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:48,641
of putting it,
you know,

95
00:03:48,641 --> 00:03:49,474
I saw John Green and hank green and I 
started to watch the vlog where those 

96
00:03:51,101 --> 00:03:51,934
videos and I was inspired by them,
but mostly I was inspired by the 

97
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,840
community of nerdfighteria.

98
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,270
I just had this feeling that maybe a lot
of you have to,

99
00:03:58,271 --> 00:03:59,104
that you know,
the future of art and expression is 

100
00:04:01,811 --> 00:04:02,644
going to be within these communities 
that are built online and elsewhere 

101
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:09,040
where people from all over the world can
get together and share what they did and

102
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:09,874
I started thinking I'm willing to 
support anybody in nerdfighteria who's 

103
00:04:11,981 --> 00:04:14,350
got something to show some form of 
expression,

104
00:04:14,351 --> 00:04:16,210
whether,
whether it's art or science,

105
00:04:16,211 --> 00:04:17,044
any of these things.
As long as there's some merit to it and 

106
00:04:18,671 --> 00:04:21,220
you know,
America comes from practice and practice

107
00:04:21,221 --> 00:04:22,031
and practice.
It's not.

108
00:04:22,031 --> 00:04:24,220
Everything's good.
Not Everybody's going to be good for the

109
00:04:24,221 --> 00:04:26,290
people who are and they're a part of my 
community.

110
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,750
I'm gonna support you because that's 
what a community is.

111
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:29,351
Now.
I'm hoping this,

112
00:04:29,351 --> 00:04:32,310
maybe it's like I get myself,
you know,

113
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,210
I don't know how old this publishing 
thing is going to work.

114
00:04:34,211 --> 00:04:35,044
I'm going into the breach when I'm done 
revising this book and I hope that 

115
00:04:37,781 --> 00:04:39,460
something can come of it.
I hope that it's a good book.

116
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:41,200
I guess you'll tell me that you'll be 
the judge of that,

117
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:43,090
but thank you for watching my video.
Thank you.

118
00:04:43,091 --> 00:04:45,790
John Green and hank green and all 
nerdfighteria for being part of this.

119
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:52,540
That was.
I looked at myself again.
