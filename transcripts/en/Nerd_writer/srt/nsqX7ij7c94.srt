00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:04,710
Coffee on a Tuesday and blog 26.
I'm back,

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:05,553
baby.

3
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,600
In the spring of 18,
18,

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,320
the poet John Keats wrote a letter to 
his friend John Hamilton Reynolds,

5
00:00:22,321 --> 00:00:27,090
which contained in it a poetic metaphor 
for how he saw human life.

6
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:27,983
He called it the mansion of many 
apartments and the image goes sort of 

7
00:00:32,221 --> 00:00:34,230
like this.
The first department we step into,

8
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:39,120
he calls the thoughtless chamber here.
We remain for as long as we do not think

9
00:00:39,121 --> 00:00:39,954
now,
I think keats means by this thinking 

10
00:00:41,671 --> 00:00:43,140
deeply,
philosophically,

11
00:00:43,141 --> 00:00:44,100
poetically,
et Cetera,

12
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:47,850
and the whole time we're in this 
chamber,

13
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:49,043
this apartment,
the door to the next department is wide 

14
00:00:51,901 --> 00:00:54,480
open,
showing a bright appearance on the other

15
00:00:54,481 --> 00:00:56,970
side.
Now at first,

16
00:00:56,971 --> 00:00:58,860
maybe we have no motivation to move 
toward it,

17
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:03,480
but slowly,
eventually the thinking principle impels

18
00:01:03,481 --> 00:01:06,220
us to and we go in.
Now,

19
00:01:06,221 --> 00:01:08,250
once we get inside into the second 
chamber,

20
00:01:08,251 --> 00:01:09,084
which keeps calls,
the Chamber of maiden thought we become 

21
00:01:12,331 --> 00:01:14,790
intoxicated by the light and atmosphere.

22
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:15,623
We see nothing but pleasant wonders and 
think of the laying there forever in 

23
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:20,460
delight.
In other words,

24
00:01:20,461 --> 00:01:24,750
we get a taste of the ideal.
Then the mood changes,

25
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:25,973
one of the effects of sharpening one's 
mind and the Chamber of maiden thought 

26
00:01:28,531 --> 00:01:31,620
is that one begins to see deeper into 
the heart of man,

27
00:01:31,621 --> 00:01:33,210
into the misery,
pain,

28
00:01:33,211 --> 00:01:36,510
sickness and depression,
that the world is full of.

29
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:40,410
These things gradually begin to darken 
the chamber,

30
00:01:40,411 --> 00:01:41,244
fill it with the fog,
but at the same time that it gets dark 

31
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:45,413
on all sides of the room,
doors are set open leading away to dark 

32
00:01:51,271 --> 00:01:52,104
passages,
which it then becomes one's choice to 

33
00:01:53,911 --> 00:01:56,910
take or not take.
You can see that even in a letter,

34
00:01:56,911 --> 00:01:59,220
keats's powers of description are 
extraordinary.

35
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,610
He later coined the term negative 
capability,

36
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:03,653
a concept to describe an artist who 
understanding the inherent mysteries of 

37
00:02:07,021 --> 00:02:11,490
life could find the strength to remain 
to be in uncertainties,

38
00:02:11,491 --> 00:02:12,324
mysteries,
doubts without any irritable reaching 

39
00:02:14,071 --> 00:02:15,120
after fact and reason.

40
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:16,223
He cited Shakespeare as a key example of
an artist who had achieved this in 1890 

41
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,020
a year.
After the letter to John Reynolds,

42
00:02:22,021 --> 00:02:25,500
keats writes his own to a nightingale,
one of his best works.

43
00:02:25,501 --> 00:02:28,170
Indeed,
one of the best works of poetry,

44
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,093
in my opinion,
eight stands as long the poem tells of 

45
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:32,124
the narrators reaction to hearing the 
song of a nightingale to bird being 

46
00:02:35,641 --> 00:02:36,474
representative of the ideal and his 
profound longing to join it even at the 

47
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:41,874
expense of his life.
The poem starts with the narrator 

48
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,193
becoming paralyzed by the bird song,
which commences a journey through the 

49
00:02:49,981 --> 00:02:52,050
layers of his soul.
Now,

50
00:02:52,051 --> 00:02:52,884
in a minute,
I'm just going to put a link up here 

51
00:02:54,901 --> 00:02:55,734
probably right here to another video 
where all recite the poem for you 

52
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,873
because poems like this should be heard.
And in the corner somewhere in one of 

53
00:03:03,491 --> 00:03:04,324
these corners,
I'm going to put numbers corresponding 

54
00:03:07,001 --> 00:03:09,780
to the stanza so that you'll have a sign
posts,

55
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:10,750
um,
as,

56
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:11,603
as we go along,
try to keep in mind the metaphor of the 

57
00:03:14,531 --> 00:03:18,040
management of many apartments and the 
concept of negative capability.

58
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:19,950
While I'm reading it.
Also,

59
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:20,973
it might be worthwhile to say that the 
general rule with art is that you could 

60
00:03:24,581 --> 00:03:27,880
have any feeling about it that you damn 
well please,

61
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:29,043
but whatever you like,
whatever you know you fancy in terms of 

62
00:03:32,831 --> 00:03:33,664
art,
it's good to memorize poems I highly 

63
00:03:36,611 --> 00:03:37,444
recommended,
and if you want to memorize one of your 

64
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:42,130
favorite poems and recite it and posted 
as a rated video response,

65
00:03:42,131 --> 00:03:46,270
I will most certainly put it up on the 
video so

66
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:47,810
the link should be there.
Now,

67
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:50,180
maybe here,
I don't know.

68
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:51,620
Clicked.
Click on it.

69
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,690
Oh,
to a nightingale like John Keats.

70
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:56,020
Click here,
right here,

71
00:03:56,490 --> 00:04:00,830
right here.
My face is now the lake.

72
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:04,100
It's a good poem.
I promise.

73
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:08,080
You have to believe me.
You have to believe me.

74
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:09,720
Please.
Believe me.

75
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:13,300
You

76
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,133
clicked yet.
