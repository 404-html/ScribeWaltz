1
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,140
There's a three minute and 20 ish second
long scene in the middle of the animated

2
00:00:25,141 --> 00:00:27,780
Saifai Action Thriller Ghost in the 
Shell.

3
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:32,310
It doesn't really qualify as Saifai 
action or thriller.

4
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,473
It's a sequence of 34 gorgeous,
exquisitely detailed atmospheric shots 

5
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:39,143
of a future city in Japan that's modeled
after Hong Kong and I'm tempted to make 

6
00:00:43,471 --> 00:00:46,740
an hour long video dissecting each shot 
individually,

7
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:47,963
but I really want to look at what this 
interlude accomplishes as a whole by 

8
00:00:51,691 --> 00:00:54,810
itself and in the context of the film 
and its themes.

9
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,153
The first thing to note is that this 
montage is full of what Scott mccloud 

10
00:00:58,411 --> 00:00:59,244
has called aspect to aspect transitions.
Mccloud is the author of an absolutely 

11
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,003
essential graphic novel on the art and 
craft of comics and in it he describes 

12
00:01:09,001 --> 00:01:09,834
the kind of panel to panel transitions 
that have become popular in different 

13
00:01:13,111 --> 00:01:15,240
parts of the world.
In American comics,

14
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,074
for example,
the majority of transitions are action 

15
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,450
to action fitting for a goal oriented 
culture,

16
00:01:21,451 --> 00:01:25,110
interested in telling stories about goal
oriented characters.

17
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:26,363
Japanese comics,
on the other hand have the long 

18
00:01:27,781 --> 00:01:30,510
featured,
a kind of transition that is really very

19
00:01:30,511 --> 00:01:34,470
rarely seen in the west.
The aspect to aspect transition in which

20
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,000
time is virtually abandoned for the 
exploration of space.

21
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,860
These kinds of transitions evoke a mood.
They activate the senses and imagination

22
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:44,843
and they have a rich tradition in 
Japan's use of like and often cyclical 

23
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:49,523
works of art.
The emphasis is on being there instead 

24
00:01:52,531 --> 00:01:57,390
of getting there and it's that emphasis 
at play in this interlude from ghost.

25
00:01:57,391 --> 00:02:00,330
In the shell though this is animation 
and not comics.

26
00:02:00,331 --> 00:02:04,170
The aspect to aspect categorization is I
think pretty accurate.

27
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,720
I mean people and things move in these 
frames,

28
00:02:06,721 --> 00:02:07,554
but it's impossible to tell if the shots
are meant to be read as temporarily 

29
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,023
sequential and I think it's pretty 
obvious that that question is really 

30
00:02:14,971 --> 00:02:15,804
just irrelevant.
What director Mamoru Oshii accomplishes 

31
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:19,374
here is to expand and draw attention to 
the audience's perception of space in 

32
00:02:24,091 --> 00:02:26,070
the film and what kind of space is it?

33
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,023
It's the space of a chaotic 
multicultural future city dominated by 

34
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:35,100
the intersections of old and new 
structures connected by roads,

35
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:39,840
canals and technology.
Humans move about like electricity along

36
00:02:39,841 --> 00:02:43,200
these avenues plugged into the body of 
the metropolis,

37
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:44,543
the relationship between body and mind.
Shell and ghost is of course a central 

38
00:02:48,241 --> 00:02:49,074
theme of the film which tells the story 
of a female Cyborg police officer who 

39
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:54,923
with their team hunts down a notorious 
hacker only to discover that he's an 

40
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:03,630
incor ai who wants to merge with her and
create a new higher life form.

41
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:06,003
Since most bodies in this future world 
or at least partly artificial people 

42
00:03:09,251 --> 00:03:12,850
locate their identities in their ghosts 
or their minds,

43
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,360
but with the troubling knowledge that 
these also can be hacked.

44
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:20,710
Memory identity and humanity are all 
calling into question.

45
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,230
All your memories about your wife and 
daughter are false.

46
00:03:23,231 --> 00:03:24,100
They're like a dream.

47
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:24,993
Someone's taken advantage of you.
So how can a meditation on space 

48
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:33,370
illuminate the problem and theme of 
identity in Ghost in the shell?

49
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,463
Well,
maybe the first thing we should say is 

50
00:03:35,351 --> 00:03:36,184
that spaces like identities are 
constructed though space often feels 

51
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,720
neutral or given like we could move 
anywhere within it.

52
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,790
Our movements,
our activities,

53
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:50,791
our life is always limited by the way 
space is produced in most places,

54
00:03:52,091 --> 00:03:52,924
but especially in big cities that 
production is controlled not by the 

55
00:03:55,811 --> 00:03:58,600
people,
but by gigantic moneyed interests,

56
00:03:58,601 --> 00:04:03,370
state governments or both.
And the same is true for identity spaces

57
00:04:03,371 --> 00:04:07,390
and identities are constructed and not 
always by ourselves.

58
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,253
In this respect,
Hong Kong was the perfect city to model 

59
00:04:11,261 --> 00:04:12,094
for this film.
It's a city layered with histories and 

60
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:16,060
cultural memory.
Believe it or not,

61
00:04:16,061 --> 00:04:18,190
when ghost in the shell came out in 
1995,

62
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:22,510
it was still a colony or territory of 
the United Kingdom.

63
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:26,440
It had two years left on a 99 year lease
signed in 18,

64
00:04:26,441 --> 00:04:27,274
98,
which was interrupted during the second 

65
00:04:28,931 --> 00:04:33,430
world war by a four year occupation by 
Japan now was about to be handed back to

66
00:04:33,431 --> 00:04:37,840
communist China with which it had little
relation in both politics and economy.

67
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,110
So who were the Hong Kong people 
supposed to be?

68
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:42,003
Then indeed,
how to define identity was and is a 

69
00:04:44,891 --> 00:04:49,360
vital question in the postcolonial world
as the old empires faded,

70
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:50,463
but left their centuries of subjugation 
and influence in the streets and minds 

71
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:58,060
of multicultural cities like Hong Kong 
and its inhabitants.

72
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:58,923
You don't want to maintain the often 
racist identities imposed on you by the 

73
00:05:02,711 --> 00:05:05,650
colonizers,
but you really can't go back to what you

74
00:05:05,651 --> 00:05:06,640
were before

75
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:07,613
either.
You're talking about redefining my 

76
00:05:08,851 --> 00:05:09,684
identity.
I want to guarantee that I can still be 

77
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:14,100
myself.
There isn't one.

78
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,400
Why would you wish to change in a 
dynamic environment?

79
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:22,050
Your effort to remain what you are is 
what limits you.

80
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:23,610
Look closely

81
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:27,980
at the city and you can see these 
dilemmas played out in space.

82
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:32,810
Cyber punk has always featured these 
uneasy composites of multiple cultures.

83
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:33,943
These are not utopias,
but they don't have to be imagined as 

84
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:37,903
dystopias either.
The philosopher Michel Foucault called 

85
00:05:40,191 --> 00:05:42,370
spaces like this,
Heterotopia,

86
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:47,360
places that exist in a dynamic state of 
layered and changing meanings.

87
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:48,493
Heterotopia is don't succumb to those 
forces that try to make everything the 

88
00:05:52,431 --> 00:05:53,264
same.
They are marginal spaces for the 

89
00:05:54,951 --> 00:05:58,160
voiceless to construct identities for 
themselves.

90
00:05:58,590 --> 00:05:59,423
Cyber punks,
great radical hope with that the 

91
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:01,994
blending of man and machine would have 
the same effect on personal identity 

92
00:06:05,511 --> 00:06:09,530
that multicultural cities like Hong Kong
would have on collective identity.

93
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,633
It would break down the constructs of 
gender and race and class that have 

94
00:06:14,061 --> 00:06:14,894
defined us for so long without our say.
You can see that hope in the main 

95
00:06:18,351 --> 00:06:20,090
character of ghost in the shell.

96
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,433
The three minute aspect to aspect 
interlude in the middle of this film by 

97
00:06:24,471 --> 00:06:29,471
its strong break from the rhythm of the 
plot forces us to consider the parallels

98
00:06:29,751 --> 00:06:34,100
between city and body,
network and ghost to drive this home.

99
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:34,963
The rest of the film is framed with 
characters set against the city they 

100
00:06:38,961 --> 00:06:40,280
live in.
Yes,

101
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:45,340
spaces are made by humanity,
but humanity is made by its spaces too.

102
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,143
It's a feedback loop.
A cycle made virtuous or vicious based 

103
00:06:50,991 --> 00:06:55,991
on the choices we make together.
Ghost in the shell wants to show us that

104
00:06:56,241 --> 00:07:01,241
the dynamics of ourselves and our spaces
are one in the same.

105
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,193
Hey everybody,
thanks for watching and welcome to 

106
00:07:14,881 --> 00:07:17,460
everybody who came in from last week's 
children of men video.

107
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:22,080
The response was absolutely nuts,
so thanks for spreading it around.

108
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:22,973
I wanted to say thank you because this 
is actually the 10th video that I've 

109
00:07:25,501 --> 00:07:26,334
made since I started to produce the nerd
writer full time and it's been an 

110
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:33,360
incredible 10 weeks and it's all because
of you guys supporting me on Patrion.

111
00:07:33,361 --> 00:07:34,194
Um,
it wouldn't be possible without you 

112
00:07:34,891 --> 00:07:35,724
guys.
I know some of you do it to get the 

113
00:07:36,571 --> 00:07:37,404
rewards mugs and stickers,
but most of you do it because you 

114
00:07:39,121 --> 00:07:43,080
believe in this kind of relationship 
between creator and audience.

115
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:45,540
And I really do too.
There's nothing between us.

116
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:46,374
There's nothing between me and you and I
think that's really a model for the 

117
00:07:49,411 --> 00:07:50,244
future.
So thank you for supporting me on 

118
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:53,760
Patrion.
I'm about $850 a video now.

119
00:07:53,761 --> 00:07:55,710
I want to try to get it to a thousand 
dollars.

120
00:07:55,711 --> 00:07:58,170
That's the big video just to make this 
financially feasible.

121
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:01,140
Um,
there's more rewards coming next week.

122
00:08:01,141 --> 00:08:02,550
There's probably going to be a google 
hangout with me,

123
00:08:02,551 --> 00:08:03,384
so if you are a patron,
a patron checked on the messages for 

124
00:08:06,151 --> 00:08:09,150
that and I'll let you know when it is.
Thank you again.

125
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,520
I will see you guys next Wednesday.
