1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,080
I love the novelist Lawrence Durrell.
Here's why

2
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,940
in the prefatory note to derails novel 
who's are he writes,

3
00:00:11,941 --> 00:00:14,970
modern literature offers us know 
humanities,

4
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:15,863
so I have turned to science and I'm 
trying to complete a four decker novel 

5
00:00:18,961 --> 00:00:21,570
whose form is based on the relativity 
proposition.

6
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:25,890
Three sides of space,
and one of time constitute a soup mix of

7
00:00:25,891 --> 00:00:28,650
a continuum.
The four novels follow this pattern.

8
00:00:28,651 --> 00:00:29,484
Darryl's masterpiece.
The Alexandria Quartet is modeled after 

9
00:00:32,341 --> 00:00:33,174
this concept.
The first three novels tell of the same 

10
00:00:35,641 --> 00:00:36,474
series of events from different 
perspectives with each new novel 

11
00:00:39,781 --> 00:00:42,540
recontextualizing what actually 
happened.

12
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:43,374
These represent the three dimensions of 
space and show that one perspective can 

13
00:00:46,831 --> 00:00:47,664
never illustrate the whole picture.
The fourth and final novel revisits 

14
00:00:51,001 --> 00:00:51,834
these same characters five years later,
adding the additional perspective of 

15
00:00:55,561 --> 00:00:57,630
time,
creating a continuum.

16
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:58,411
Now,
many people,

17
00:00:58,411 --> 00:01:00,870
including drls friends,
have noted that saying,

18
00:01:00,871 --> 00:01:01,704
the Alexandria Quartet is a model of the
space time continuum is nothing but a 

19
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:06,780
semantic device.

20
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,673
These people are of course,
write a continuum of the store can only 

21
00:01:10,051 --> 00:01:13,230
be expressed in mathematics and not in 
words,

22
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,700
but just as,
for example,

23
00:01:14,701 --> 00:01:19,700
the mercator projection is meant to give
the impression of a sphere derails.

24
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:20,543
Quartet is only meant to give the 
impression of a continue as special 

25
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:26,550
relativity forced us to see reality in a
new way.

26
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:31,350
The form of the quartet does the same 
thing with the concept of personality as

27
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,080
space and time are relative to each 
other.

28
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:38,340
Personalities are relative to other 
personalities.

29
00:01:38,341 --> 00:01:40,350
As Darryl's character,
our says,

30
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:44,610
each psyche is really an anthill of 
opposing predispositions.

31
00:01:44,611 --> 00:01:48,450
Personality as something with fixed 
attributes is an illusion.

32
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,313
I would go even further and say that 
personality as exclusive to one person 

33
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,460
is an illusion as well dwells.
Continuum,

34
00:01:56,461 --> 00:01:57,294
like representation of a group of lovers
and friends that picks what the 

35
00:02:00,571 --> 00:02:01,404
nightvale podcasts,
twitter handle put so succinctly a few 

36
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:04,620
days ago.

37
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:09,510
A name is ally that keeps you from 
thinking that you might be more than one

38
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:10,450
single.
B,

39
00:02:10,451 --> 00:02:11,284
it seems to me that the separation of 
objects in space leads us to believe 

40
00:02:15,121 --> 00:02:19,080
that we ourselves are separate from the 
ones we love,

41
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:19,943
when in truth we blend into and warp one
another in the same way that time and 

42
00:02:23,761 --> 00:02:27,030
space do.
In the presence of supermassive objects.

43
00:02:27,031 --> 00:02:30,390
I am an active part of the personalities
of my friends,

44
00:02:30,391 --> 00:02:34,470
just as my friends are active 
constituents of my personnel.

45
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,333
Drl is so important to me because in the
Alexandria Quartet and later in the 

46
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,793
Avignon Quintet,
the basic unit of humanity is never an 

47
00:02:43,381 --> 00:02:44,214
individual but a group of friends,
and to depict the complexity of that 

48
00:02:49,321 --> 00:02:50,154
unit,
drl has to contextualize and 

49
00:02:52,231 --> 00:02:57,231
recontextualize until multiple people 
begin to feel like one organism.

50
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:02,140
He finds the model in four dimensional 
space time and it comes off brilliantly.

51
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:03,363
It's the kind of work that breaks down 
our self conceptions and shows us what 

52
00:03:07,091 --> 00:03:12,091
we is.
If there's a used bookstore around you,

53
00:03:16,631 --> 00:03:17,464
go find something by Darrelle.
The Alexandria Quartet is obviously my 

54
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:25,030
favorite and I think it's the best.
Here's are,

55
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:30,090
and I have some other.
Justine phalluses are mount,

56
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,110
Mount Olive and clay,
and also I'm reading right now the first

57
00:03:38,111 --> 00:03:40,810
of the heavy on Quintet,
which is called Matsuura.
