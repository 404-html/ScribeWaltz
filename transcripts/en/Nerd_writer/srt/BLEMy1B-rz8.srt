00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,100
Hello,
all you haymakers and hamburgers,

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,760
coffee on a Tuesday and Vlog 58

3
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:17,460
with

4
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:18,293
few exceptions.
I don't really read much contemporary 

5
00:00:20,131 --> 00:00:21,740
fiction.
It's been that way for awhile.

6
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:22,613
If you take a look at my bookshelf,
what you'll find is a collection of 

7
00:00:24,361 --> 00:00:28,290
almost exclusively classic author like 
Henry James Proust.

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,270
Hugo came up now because steinbeck balls
and of course shakespeare.

9
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,133
Now there's an irony to this because 
many of these books were assigned to me 

10
00:00:36,601 --> 00:00:38,370
as part of my secondary school 
curriculum,

11
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:39,204
but in almost every case,
what I read look more like this than 

12
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:46,200
this.
How many windows do I have over there?

13
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,330
In one sense,
I'm glad these books were assigned to us

14
00:00:48,331 --> 00:00:50,550
because now when I actually want to read
them,

15
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,650
I know exactly where to look.
Actually,

16
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,280
I sometimes suspect that that's the 
reason why they assign them to us in the

17
00:00:56,281 --> 00:00:57,114
first place to map the intellectual 
geography of what is important and 

18
00:01:00,091 --> 00:01:01,920
lasting in literature.
I mean,

19
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:03,480
what other reason could there be?

20
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,313
I remember rereading Hawthorne's,
the scarlet letter a few years back and 

21
00:01:06,481 --> 00:01:07,314
thinking whoever gave this to me when I 
was 15 must have been insane to think I 

22
00:01:11,161 --> 00:01:11,994
had the mental acuity to process one of,
if not the premier novel in American 

23
00:01:16,351 --> 00:01:17,184
literature at that age.
I barely had the mental acuity to 

24
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:21,660
process the matrix realities,
mo doubt,

25
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:27,110
reality,
dreams will destiny.

26
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:30,060
Now,
I use the word classic in a pretty broad

27
00:01:30,061 --> 00:01:30,894
sense for me.
It can be anything from homer and 

28
00:01:32,221 --> 00:01:36,390
Shakespeare to whack and Philip K,
Dick Essentially I'm using as my measure

29
00:01:36,391 --> 00:01:39,570
a kind of collective academic agreement 
about what is great,

30
00:01:39,571 --> 00:01:42,300
what is influential or pressure or 
complex.

31
00:01:42,301 --> 00:01:44,810
Really whatever penguin has made a 
version,

32
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,280
but perhaps I'm wrong to let penguin be 
the arbiter of what is and isn't a class

33
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,183
taking a more precise definition.
I've turned to the great ts Elliot who 

34
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,513
in his essay what is a classic contends 
that there are actually no classics in 

35
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:00,840
all of English literature,
even such greats as Milton Shakespeare,

36
00:02:00,841 --> 00:02:01,674
to whom there are perhaps no superiors 
in style and maturity fail to achieve 

37
00:02:05,911 --> 00:02:08,400
classical status because of the language
itself.

38
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,790
Had not yet reached mature.
A common style writes Eliot is one which

39
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:12,624
makes us exclaimed,
not this is a man of genius using the 

40
00:02:14,671 --> 00:02:15,504
language,
but this realizes the genius of the 

41
00:02:18,301 --> 00:02:19,134
language.
We do not say this when reading 

42
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,730
Shakespeare or Milton because we are 
always conscious of the greatness of the

43
00:02:23,731 --> 00:02:27,150
man and the miracles that he is 
performing with the length.

44
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,043
Indeed Elliot holds that a universal 
classic comes at the confluence of a 

45
00:02:30,831 --> 00:02:31,664
maturity of mind,
manners and common style that Elizabeth 

46
00:02:35,401 --> 00:02:37,110
and poetry,
as I've said before,

47
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,123
is more invented by Shakespeare then 
fully realized by him that the manners 

48
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:42,623
of the period were more provincial than 
universal elliot points to Virgil's 

49
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:50,940
Aeneid as the quintessential classic and
to Latin as the quintessential classical

50
00:02:50,941 --> 00:02:51,774
language for consolidates.
The greatness of a mature predecessor 

51
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:58,620
and is the common ancestor to which all 
of the European languages are air.

52
00:02:58,650 --> 00:02:59,483
It is by the standard of Virgil and 
Latin that old modern works are judged 

53
00:03:03,191 --> 00:03:04,024
and it is a necessary standard for 
English literature to Excel and not be 

54
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:12,010
consumed by chaos while being perhaps 
impossible for it to achieve.

55
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,190
Though we must soldier on imagining that
we can't,

56
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,920
it's the idea of a common style that 
interests me.

57
00:03:17,921 --> 00:03:18,754
Most.
Common style is something that marks a 

58
00:03:20,651 --> 00:03:23,860
classical period,
whether in Elliot's larger sense or in a

59
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,510
lowercase sense,
so to speak,

60
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,630
of classics within English,
poetry and prose.

61
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:29,523
It doesn't mean as Elliot says that the 
best writers of such a period are 

62
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,393
indistinguishable,
but rather that there are differences 

63
00:03:34,751 --> 00:03:35,584
are more subtle and refined like the 
shades of tastes between superlative 

64
00:03:39,401 --> 00:03:40,234
wine and it is also a mark of a 
classical period that the era before it 

65
00:03:43,091 --> 00:03:43,924
is branded with eccentricities as 
writers stab in the dark towards 

66
00:03:47,111 --> 00:03:47,944
something not yet universal and 
eccentricity to as the classical period 

67
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,050
passes away and originality becomes more
valued than correctness.

68
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,140
I don't know what period we find 
ourselves in today,

69
00:03:59,141 --> 00:04:04,141
but eccentricities a kind of agitated 
free for all seems to describe it.

70
00:04:04,241 --> 00:04:07,090
This of course reflects the culture at 
large.

71
00:04:07,091 --> 00:04:07,924
Not that we are devoid of great authors,
but rather have great movements of a 

72
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:15,460
common style and every time I sit down 
to write,

73
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,450
I find it impossible not to aim at 
classic.

74
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,313
Now,
maybe this suggests a Hubris in me or 

75
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:24,124
maybe the fact that I'm self conscious 
about it suggests a deficiency in the 

76
00:04:27,731 --> 00:04:28,564
period as a writer and reader in 2013,
I engage in no revolt against the 

77
00:04:32,501 --> 00:04:36,310
current state of English literature.
It's too heterogeneous now.

78
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,353
Even for that,
I only wished to navigate that old and 

79
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,553
shamefully pass a river,
which from the mountain of homework 

80
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:49,710
passes through all my heroes and me too.
I know not what?

81
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:00,001
