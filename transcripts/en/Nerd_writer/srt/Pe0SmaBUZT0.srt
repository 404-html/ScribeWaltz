00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,580
With other social media,
I'm not sure,

2
00:00:02,581 --> 00:00:07,260
but I have no doubt that read it is 
improving my life.

3
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:15,660
Reddit is hive,
mind meets extreme democracy.

4
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:19,410
It has the personality of a single human
being,

5
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:20,303
but it also reflects the personalities 
of millions of people all around the 

6
00:00:24,031 --> 00:00:24,864
world.
The uniformity of sensibility which can 

7
00:00:26,731 --> 00:00:27,564
be seen on the front page where the most
popular links are found becomes much 

8
00:00:31,771 --> 00:00:34,530
more amazing.
When I see that in the last month,

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,600
reddit had $90,
million,

10
00:00:36,601 --> 00:00:41,601
946,972
unique visitor as hank green might say.

11
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,120
I'm not going to get my mind around 
that.

12
00:00:45,121 --> 00:00:47,970
Speaking of Hank Green and the vlog 
brothers Nerdfighteria,

13
00:00:47,971 --> 00:00:48,804
their online community is a smaller but 
analogous example to the reddit 

14
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,633
universe.
Nerdfighteria has its own events like 

15
00:00:55,411 --> 00:00:56,244
the project for awesome and its own 
eccentricities like pizza John or 

16
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:00,893
sharpie face or peanut butter face.
In the same way reddit has its own 

17
00:01:03,841 --> 00:01:06,900
personality traits like its obsession 
with memes.

18
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:10,320
Video Games,
the asked me anything feature or explain

19
00:01:10,321 --> 00:01:12,780
like I'm five.
It has its own politics right now.

20
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:13,733
For example,
it's really invested in the NSA scandal 

21
00:01:15,421 --> 00:01:18,060
and issues concerning Internet 
censorship.

22
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,460
There are things it hates,
like improper reddick.

23
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:22,343
One thing I discovered this week is that
reddit dislikes the creation of new 

24
00:01:26,101 --> 00:01:26,934
means for my friend's 30th birthday.
All his friends came together to make 

25
00:01:30,031 --> 00:01:32,440
him into a popular meme.
Um,

26
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:33,383
it's called the sad elias meme and you 
can find the link for it in the 

27
00:01:35,641 --> 00:01:38,160
description and submit anything to it 
that you want.

28
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:42,060
Um,
but when I tried to post our examples to

29
00:01:42,061 --> 00:01:42,894
read it,
I found out that making memes of 

30
00:01:45,001 --> 00:01:48,840
pictures that you've taken is a ban 
double offense.

31
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,840
A banana bowl events in its countless 
subreddits,

32
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:53,693
communities are more specific and 
cultish and like the dark side of 

33
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:58,223
Tumblr,
Reddit has its fair share of porn and 

34
00:02:00,391 --> 00:02:01,290
nasty shit.

35
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:04,230
Here's a perfect example of what I love 
about reading.

36
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,380
This is a screenshot I took of an Ama 
with Lord.

37
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:11,700
It starts with Lord answering a question
about her seeming fixation with teeth in

38
00:02:11,701 --> 00:02:13,800
her lyrics.
And she admits the obsession,

39
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:14,634
but says that she hates dentists.
And the first response is a Seinfeld 

40
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:20,520
reference.
He's just a dentist.

41
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:21,693
And your an anti identity.
Then the second response is a comedic 

42
00:02:26,341 --> 00:02:28,230
use of the transitive property of 
equality.

43
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:29,243
Then we have a run of dentists and teeth
related puns in which Lord rejoins the 

44
00:02:33,901 --> 00:02:34,734
conversation with a pun of her own.
Then someone makes a teeth and Lord 

45
00:02:38,221 --> 00:02:41,160
Related Pun.
Then someone finds an image of what that

46
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:41,994
pun describes and then the next person 
shares the link to that artists other 

47
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:46,591
work.
Remember,

48
00:02:46,591 --> 00:02:49,590
the comments aren't chronological.
They're based on upvotes,

49
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:50,543
which means that the order they appear 
in represents what redditors care about 

50
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,890
the most.
In this case,

51
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,500
clever references,
puns,

52
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,780
Fan art,
and proper attribution.

53
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:01,623
My favorite thing about reddit is that 
it's almost 100 percent content based 

54
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,540
though millions of people contribute to 
it.

55
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:08,403
They do so anonymously.
It's not mixed up with the pathetic 

56
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:12,874
local fame obsessions of facebook and 
instagram or the much larger fame 

57
00:03:16,931 --> 00:03:17,764
obsessions of Youtube personalities like
myself in the social media war between 

58
00:03:22,811 --> 00:03:27,550
platforms that represent social and 
platforms that represent media.

59
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:32,830
Reddit is the purest representation of 
the nobler side.

60
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,313
Yeah.

61
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:39,543
Yes.
So you probably want to know why I 

62
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:43,630
haven't posted a video and I don't even 
know how many months,

63
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:46,390
lot of reasons.
Laziness,

64
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,570
disgusted with the form.
Still a little bit disgusted with it.

65
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:53,740
I'm 60 vlogs straight.
I just was burnt out.

66
00:03:53,741 --> 00:03:54,574
I had nothing more to say,
but mostly I just wanted to try other 

67
00:03:56,561 --> 00:03:57,394
things.
And one of the things I did try was 

68
00:03:58,481 --> 00:04:01,680
making music.
I just released an APP,

69
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:05,770
uh,
under my dj producer name,

70
00:04:05,771 --> 00:04:08,680
which is strum stick called new 
disguises.

71
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:11,440
You can find it on spotify,
soundcloud,

72
00:04:11,441 --> 00:04:12,520
itunes,
wherever.

73
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,533
Go listen to it.
I spent a lot of time and effort on it 

74
00:04:16,571 --> 00:04:17,440
and I'm,
I'm proud of it.

75
00:04:17,441 --> 00:04:19,570
And it's something that I want to 
explore much,

76
00:04:19,571 --> 00:04:20,404
much further.
