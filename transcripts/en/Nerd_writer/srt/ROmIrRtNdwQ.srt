Hello and welcome to the nerd writer 
podcast movie review edition.

2
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,400
This is the first podcast that I'm 
attempting to do.

3
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,300
I love podcasts.
I love listening to them.

4
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:17,310
I just think there's something special 
about them.

5
00:00:17,311 --> 00:00:21,120
I love audio.
I love really great audio love listening

6
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:24,240
to the human voice when it's nice 
clothes.

7
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:28,230
Nice and close to a really good mic.
So I'm going to try a podcast here.

8
00:00:28,231 --> 00:00:31,620
I just got out of the movie looper and I
want to talk about that today.

9
00:00:31,621 --> 00:00:35,520
I'm not going to do percentages.
Can do rotten tomatoes for that.

10
00:00:35,521 --> 00:00:37,710
Not going to do stars.
You can do Roger Ebert for that.

11
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:38,873
I just want to talk about the movie and 
I think that I do have the 

12
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:45,000
qualifications to talk about movies 
because I was a film student.

13
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,180
I know a little bit about what goes into
making a movie.

14
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:50,400
I've tried writing short films.

15
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:54,690
I even tried a getting my hand trying to
do a feature a couple of years ago.

16
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,600
It didn't work out,
but I at least know what it takes,

17
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:00,810
so I have all that.
Much more respect for Ryan Johnson,

18
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:05,811
the director of looper and writer who 
composed this time travel story.

19
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:07,920
Oh,
and I want to mention before I start,

20
00:01:07,921 --> 00:01:11,610
I haven't read anything about this.
I haven't seen any reviews,

21
00:01:11,611 --> 00:01:12,444
haven't read any reviews.
I don't know what rotten tomatoes even 

22
00:01:13,891 --> 00:01:15,000
gave it,
which is strange for me.

23
00:01:15,001 --> 00:01:15,834
I usually always check before I go.
I know what some friends have said and 

24
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,250
the reviews have been in the all in the 
range of good,

25
00:01:23,251 --> 00:01:25,260
some really good,
some great,

26
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,860
some luke warm,
but still mostly positive,

27
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:34,020
so I really enjoyed it.
I had a great time watching the movie,

28
00:01:34,021 --> 00:01:36,270
the experience of watching.
It was a lot of fun.

29
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:37,103
The first,
the first half hour to an hour of the 

30
00:01:39,151 --> 00:01:43,380
movie I thought was just flawless 
storytelling really quick.

31
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,780
Getting all the information out there 
that you need.

32
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,560
The world that they're living in.
Twenty,

33
00:01:49,561 --> 00:01:54,360
44 is explained in the process of the 
story.

34
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,313
Future movies that are set in the future
can sometimes get caught up in 

35
00:01:58,021 --> 00:02:00,090
explaining the world that they're living
in.

36
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,380
I don't think that looper falls into 
that trap.

37
00:02:04,381 --> 00:02:05,214
I think that the elements of the future,
the future technologies that you're 

38
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,380
showing,
the way that the world is,

39
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:11,603
are done as a,
as sort of a side glance to the story 

40
00:02:15,931 --> 00:02:16,764
proper.
And I think that the world is very 

41
00:02:18,691 --> 00:02:19,524
interesting.
There's a few sort of technological 

42
00:02:20,671 --> 00:02:22,980
changes that you see,
things that you might expect.

43
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:23,843
Nothing too ridiculous,
but also you get the sense that this is 

44
00:02:27,661 --> 00:02:29,730
a dystopian future.
The 20,

45
00:02:29,731 --> 00:02:34,731
44 of this world is something has gone 
wrong in the period of time in between.

46
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,740
And maybe it's something terrible has 
gone wrong.

47
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:38,623
They've,
I think they make one reference to the 

48
00:02:39,511 --> 00:02:40,344
vagrant raids of the something.
Something so governments or the ability 

49
00:02:45,061 --> 00:02:50,061
to police whatever city that this story 
is set in a sort of broken down a little

50
00:02:50,101 --> 00:02:53,130
bit.
Seems like the crime bosses have control

51
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:55,770
of the town.
People are getting shot,

52
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:56,813
you know,
out near buses for whatever reason 

53
00:02:59,591 --> 00:03:01,750
because you know,
they're trying to steal something.

54
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,093
Um,
so it's not a place that you'd maybe 

55
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:08,860
want to live unless that is,
you were a looper.

56
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:12,520
And I think that the character of the 
loopers very interesting.

57
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:16,690
And I'm realizing things as I,
as I just thinking about this movie,

58
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,553
having seen it,
which I think is going to happen in the 

59
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:20,730
next couple of days,
which I,

60
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:21,563
which is a mark of a good movie.
One of the things is that these loopers 

61
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:28,660
are people who are not really thinking 
about their future,

62
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:29,470
right?

63
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:34,470
They go to the same bar every day.
They get paid for their job,

64
00:03:35,021 --> 00:03:39,310
killing people from the future,
and they're doing the same drugs.

65
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:41,800
You know when I was for those,
for those of us went to college,

66
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:43,503
I used to call this the haze.
You just do the same things over and 

67
00:03:46,241 --> 00:03:51,241
over again and it felt like frankly a 
loop right the same night,

68
00:03:51,251 --> 00:03:54,880
the same weekend over and over again.
You lose track of time.

69
00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:55,714
You lose track of yourself.
I think that is something that the 

70
00:03:57,161 --> 00:03:59,260
loopers in this movie are definitely 
going through,

71
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:04,410
symbolized by the fact that one of the 
key elements is something called closing

72
00:04:04,781 --> 00:04:05,614
the loop where the bosses in the future 
of somehow deemed it cleaning their own 

73
00:04:09,701 --> 00:04:14,701
hands of loose ends.
They've sent back these kid loopers when

74
00:04:14,891 --> 00:04:15,724
they're older,
30 years in the future to kill 

75
00:04:16,571 --> 00:04:17,404
themselves.
You don't know that it's going to be 

76
00:04:18,161 --> 00:04:22,480
them because they're bagged on the head,
but these kids,

77
00:04:22,481 --> 00:04:25,510
these loopers don't,
they really don't have a future.

78
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:29,860
They have 30 years and that's it.
So there's a layer there.

79
00:04:29,861 --> 00:04:30,694
There's a subtext there of are these 
people's lives anything more than what 

80
00:04:34,721 --> 00:04:35,554
they do?
The montage in the beginning does a lot 

81
00:04:36,881 --> 00:04:38,140
of that for you.
Um,

82
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,240
and the way that the drug,
for example,

83
00:04:40,241 --> 00:04:42,490
this drop in your eyes filmed,
it's just really,

84
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,353
really stylistic and smart and I think 
that is something that is shown 

85
00:04:46,211 --> 00:04:47,950
throughout the whole movie.
But moving on.

86
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:49,043
Oh,
and I probably should mention there's 

87
00:04:49,751 --> 00:04:51,700
going to be spoilers in this.
So if you haven't seen it,

88
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,670
I'd say stop listening right now and go 
out and see it.

89
00:04:54,671 --> 00:04:59,671
It is worth your money to say,
so things start to get a little bit more

90
00:04:59,711 --> 00:05:01,030
intense,
more serious.

91
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:05,500
When Joseph [inaudible] character played
by Bruce will lets his future self comes

92
00:05:05,501 --> 00:05:06,334
back to the past and they show in a 
montage of the years intervening what 

93
00:05:10,451 --> 00:05:11,150
happens to him.

94
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:13,690
He goes to China,
does some more killing,

95
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:19,140
but then eventually falls in love with 
this Asian woman who he says saves some,

96
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:20,763
saves them from this life.
Now there's potentially troubling thing 

97
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,753
in this to begin with,
which is the fact that Joseph Horne 

98
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:31,110
Levitt is a murderer.
He's murdered people who he doesn't know

99
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,673
that they've done something bad.
Even if we cited that murdering people 

100
00:05:35,391 --> 00:05:36,224
was okay.
It doesn't know that it doesn't mean 

101
00:05:37,551 --> 00:05:38,384
bad.
He's just taking.

102
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:39,603
He's taking the word of the bosses in 
the future that they want them dead so 

103
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:44,260
he doesn't.
It's,

104
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,330
it's,
it's hard already to sympathize with him

105
00:05:46,331 --> 00:05:49,120
in the beginning.
That will become much,

106
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:52,540
much harder for the Bruce Willis 
character later in the movie,

107
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:53,374
but we'll get to that.
The main criticism I have with time 

108
00:05:57,561 --> 00:06:01,040
travel movies and this movie is that 
depending on what the movie is,

109
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,630
you can sort of get a sense.

110
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:03,643
You get the feeling towards the end that
the movie is trying to figure itself 

111
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,880
out.
Time travel.

112
00:06:09,881 --> 00:06:10,714
Movies are so much about the writing of 
them is so much about closing all the 

113
00:06:13,281 --> 00:06:14,510
loop,
the loose ends,

114
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,940
making sure that it logical,
that it works right,

115
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,750
especially ones that are explicitly 
about time travel,

116
00:06:20,751 --> 00:06:21,531
like Lupron.
Now of course,

117
00:06:21,531 --> 00:06:25,370
you can't close out every loose end with
time travel movies.

118
00:06:25,371 --> 00:06:27,470
We always take things for granted.
For example,

119
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,453
we know that it's not logical that only 
small things would change for the 

120
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:37,010
future.
Bruce Willis,

121
00:06:37,011 --> 00:06:40,460
when little things change in the 
presence of the movie,

122
00:06:40,461 --> 00:06:41,294
when he cuts his arm,
we know that little moments in the 

123
00:06:43,821 --> 00:06:44,654
future affect big consequences or 
lithium is in the president effect big 

124
00:06:48,561 --> 00:06:50,070
consequences in the future.
The,

125
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,230
the,
the butterfly effect,

126
00:06:51,231 --> 00:06:54,410
the chaos effects.
So all of these things being at being at

127
00:06:54,411 --> 00:06:55,244
that bar to meet that Asian woman who 
eventually marries those things don't 

128
00:06:57,471 --> 00:06:58,340
happen after.

129
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:02,710
It's a little thing like a,
just a small misstep in the,

130
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,920
in,
in another direction.

131
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,390
Um,
happens.

132
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:07,280
But we let those things go.
And time travel movies,

133
00:07:07,281 --> 00:07:08,114
because if we didn't,
we wouldn't be able to have time travel 

134
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:12,230
movies.
It just wouldn't work.

135
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,273
Right.
I'm back to the future of great time 

136
00:07:15,081 --> 00:07:18,350
travel movie.
The the picture disappearing thing is,

137
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:19,243
you know when,
when when their existence becomes 

138
00:07:20,451 --> 00:07:21,980
questionable,
they disappear in the picture.

139
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,023
That is ridiculous,
but because it's like it goes from the 

140
00:07:25,221 --> 00:07:28,470
head goes from the head down to the,
the,

141
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,530
the feet,
the last thing that they have.

142
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,473
That's just ridiculous,
but we let it go because we know that 

143
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:37,640
some liberties have to be taken and it's
a good example that these two movies are

144
00:07:37,641 --> 00:07:38,474
good,
are good to compare against each other 

145
00:07:39,201 --> 00:07:40,034
because the time travel elements in back
to the future are very campy to begin 

146
00:07:43,251 --> 00:07:44,084
with and it's a very campy movie and 
back to the future spends a lot of time 

147
00:07:46,911 --> 00:07:50,630
on the character and the story in the 
past.

148
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,600
Have Marty and the parents and all that 
stuff.

149
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,540
Even though time travel is the wrapping 
that is all around it.

150
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:01,370
Looper is one of these movies in the 
line of inception,

151
00:08:01,371 --> 00:08:02,204
dark knight,
the Chris Nolan type of movies where 

152
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,990
everything has to be sort of airtight,
watertight,

153
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:08,960
right?
This is really realistic.

154
00:08:08,961 --> 00:08:11,060
This is what would happen.
This is how it would be.

155
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:12,643
My main criticism of looper and in that 
vein is that you feel at the end of the 

156
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:18,613
movie,
the time travel elements of the story 

157
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,850
spinning themselves to their proper 
conclusion,

158
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:26,540
and that for me takes away from the 
character development,

159
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:31,541
which which for a great movie is always,
always the center of the story.

160
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:34,910
I'm not to say that there aren't great 
characters in this movie.

161
00:08:34,911 --> 00:08:39,140
I think that Joseph Gordon Levitt,
Bruce Willis a and emily blunt,

162
00:08:39,141 --> 00:08:41,150
do great acting jobs for their 
characters,

163
00:08:41,151 --> 00:08:44,540
but there are a few things that sort of 
go wonky in the third act first,

164
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,583
when Bruce Willis kills that kid,
whatever sympathy you had for him 

165
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,170
immediately goes what we know from Ryan 
Johnson,

166
00:08:51,171 --> 00:08:56,100
the director's choice early on,
that the fact that he doesn't show Elma,

167
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,220
emily blunt's child's face the first 
three times we see him.

168
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:02,610
We know that he's the rainmaker.
That's something that I don't think he's

169
00:09:02,611 --> 00:09:04,460
trying to hide from us.
Um,

170
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:05,933
and the fact that we know that means 
that the first kid that Bruceville's 

171
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:10,303
skills is an innocent child,
and even though he feels remorse about 

172
00:09:13,501 --> 00:09:14,334
it afterwards,
it's hard for us to sympathize with 

173
00:09:16,771 --> 00:09:17,604
Bruceville's.
Again,

174
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:18,773
I don't know if that's Ryan will ryan or
Ryan Johnson's attention for us 

175
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:23,670
sympathize,
but we don't do it after that.

176
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:25,470
Excuse me.
Taking a drink here.

177
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:32,420
And then we have that almost.
What essentially is Bruce Willis becomes

178
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:34,974
John mcclane from die hard and starts 
ripping people apart with machine guns 

179
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,553
and semiautomatic guns.
Just killing scores and scores of 

180
00:09:42,871 --> 00:09:43,710
people.
This guy,

181
00:09:43,711 --> 00:09:46,860
his last two are empathetic urges,
right?

182
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:47,723
He can't get what he wants.
You cannot build a love so strong to 

183
00:09:52,531 --> 00:09:56,760
justify for the viewer the murder that 
he commits in the end of that movie.

184
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,280
And,
and I,

185
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,113
like I said before,
it's already hard with Joseph Gordon 

186
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,131
Levitt character.
Oh,

187
00:10:02,131 --> 00:10:02,964
and one thing,
by the way that I mentioned that I had 

188
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:08,190
noticed that I don't think the person 
who was watching it with notice,

189
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:09,263
um,
which I thought was interesting little 

190
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:11,003
thing,
uh,

191
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:11,963
so the punk kid who's got the Gat,
who really shouldn't be allowed to have 

192
00:10:15,241 --> 00:10:16,740
any kind of gun because he is 
ridiculous.

193
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:20,940
That's Jeff Daniels from the future,
from,

194
00:10:20,941 --> 00:10:24,300
from the president.
That's Jeff Daniels past self.

195
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:25,583
I think the way that you can tell,
the way that I noticed it was when Jeff 

196
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,940
Daniels died and he's sort of looking at
him really sad.

197
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,360
The next thing he sees on the wall is 
the map where Joseph Gordon Levitt is,

198
00:10:33,361 --> 00:10:34,194
and there's a circle on the map and I 
think that is supposed to symbolize 

199
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,490
closing the loop.
So,

200
00:10:38,491 --> 00:10:39,840
well done,
Ryan Johnson on that.

201
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,070
That was a good little moment.

202
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,960
I think I'm reading about that.
I could be wrong.

203
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:44,003
So when Joseph Gordon Levitt,
kills himself in the end and is able to 

204
00:10:47,941 --> 00:10:50,720
change the rainmakers future to become 
it,

205
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,560
presumably he's going to become good 
now.

206
00:10:52,561 --> 00:10:54,480
Whatever him.
The process,

207
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:54,951
the,
the,

208
00:10:54,951 --> 00:10:58,530
the moment of him killing himself to me,
felt unsatisfying.

209
00:10:58,531 --> 00:10:59,364
The reason was because I felt the time 
travel elements overshadowing the 

210
00:11:03,361 --> 00:11:04,194
character elements.
There had to be an end to this story 

211
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:07,913
that worked for eight.
A fallen character like Joseph Gordon 

212
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,073
Levitt,
killing yourself is really the only way 

213
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,600
to go.
First of all.

214
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,850
So you already have that.
Second of all,

215
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,560
what happens,
you know,

216
00:11:19,561 --> 00:11:23,370
Bruce Willis cannot be made to get back 
with the Asian woman.

217
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,233
His wife,
Joseph Levitt isn't going to go on to 

218
00:11:25,471 --> 00:11:28,950
live with emily blunt and the kid.
Right?

219
00:11:28,951 --> 00:11:32,130
So this is really the only ending of the
movie that there could be.

220
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:36,990
And there are a lot of really great 
movies I should mention that have fallen

221
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,300
characters,
lowlife characters,

222
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:40,403
but it's broadcast very early on about 
those characters that they won't make 

223
00:11:43,771 --> 00:11:44,580
it.

224
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:47,400
And you know it a good distance from the
end.

225
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:49,980
The fact that Ryan Johnson tries to keep
us in suspense,

226
00:11:49,981 --> 00:11:51,780
like maybe Joseph Gordon Levitt might 
make it,

227
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:55,750
I think actually takes away from the 
movie because it would be a sort of.

228
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:58,720
I think it just would be an empty 
feeling if he got to live.

229
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:01,090
I think that's the trap the movie gets 
into.

230
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:03,490
It would be an empty feeling for the 
viewer.

231
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,353
If he got to live,
it's hard to redeem that kind of 

232
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:06,843
character,
but he didn't make him a tragic 

233
00:12:09,671 --> 00:12:11,860
character early on,
early enough in the movie.

234
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:14,350
So you're sort of vacillating between 
the two sides.

235
00:12:14,351 --> 00:12:15,730
Will he make it?
Well,

236
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:16,623
that's not going to feel great,
but he's not telling me that he's not 

237
00:12:19,571 --> 00:12:20,404
going to make it.
So that's really my main criticism of 

238
00:12:22,871 --> 00:12:23,704
the movie is that the characters are 
subsumed by the plot elements of making 

239
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,320
a time travel story work.

240
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:32,200
All that said,
really,

241
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,150
really enjoyable movie.
I mean,

242
00:12:34,151 --> 00:12:37,330
one thing that was fantastic sound 
editing sound mixing.

243
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,130
Wow,
amazing.

244
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,293
I don't know who did it,
but you did a great job and you should 

245
00:12:41,741 --> 00:12:42,574
be nominated for an Oscar because I 
thought that the way that the story 

246
00:12:45,011 --> 00:12:45,844
moved along with sound was brilliant and
despite the problems I had with the end 

247
00:12:50,531 --> 00:12:51,364
of it,
it just that that really just precludes 

248
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:55,720
it from becoming a great movie from a 
really,

249
00:12:55,721 --> 00:12:58,390
really good movie.
So I think that if you haven't seen it,

250
00:12:58,391 --> 00:13:00,640
which would be ridiculous at this point 
because I've spoiled all of it,

251
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,950
but if you haven't,
go see it,

252
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,270
it's worth the money to go.
See.

253
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:07,780
That's the review I have of looper.
I hope you enjoyed it.

254
00:13:07,781 --> 00:13:10,720
Hope it wasn't too long and if you want,
if you leave,

255
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:12,700
please leave any comments what you think
about this.

256
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:13,743
If you want me to do more of them,
it's a lot of fun and I will see you 

257
00:13:16,361 --> 00:13:17,194
next time.
