1
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:07,990
I've never been much of a fan of music 
videos and I think that's because I sort

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,833
of just like my music as music.
I like to close my eyes and focus on 

3
00:00:12,811 --> 00:00:16,140
what's happening sonically because 
that's what music is.

4
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:20,280
It's something that you hear,
so that means I can be totally engrossed

5
00:00:20,281 --> 00:00:22,740
and in love with beyonce,
his latest album,

6
00:00:22,741 --> 00:00:26,880
and not care at all about the dozen 
videos that came out with it,

7
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:27,923
but I don't know.
Maybe I'm in the minority here and the 

8
00:00:29,761 --> 00:00:33,540
truth is that despite music being an 
oral medium,

9
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:37,590
it's long had an intimate relationship 
with the visual,

10
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:38,873
so I want to talk about perhaps the most
iconic visual supplement in the history 

11
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,280
of music,
but before we talk about that,

12
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:47,143
what about album covers in general these
days we perceive them as a kind of 

13
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:52,123
visual statement,
like the album title or the song names 

14
00:00:54,771 --> 00:00:59,420
that help us situate the tone or the 
feeling of what we're going to hear.

15
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:02,630
It granted that it stays within the 
dimension of a square.

16
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,750
The options and styles are basically 
limitless,

17
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:06,883
but in the beginning,
records packaging was surely 

18
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:12,870
utilitarian.
The early 78 RPM gramophone records were

19
00:01:12,871 --> 00:01:13,704
mostly outfitted with Brown paper or 
cardboard sleeves to protect the 

20
00:01:17,641 --> 00:01:18,474
recording.
It wasn't until 1938 when Columbia 

21
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:21,624
records hired Alex.
stine Weiss as its very first art 

22
00:01:24,601 --> 00:01:25,434
director that the idea of cover art came
into existence against the plane or 

23
00:01:29,701 --> 00:01:30,534
traditional design of early covers.
Stein Weiss's original eyecatching art 

24
00:01:34,201 --> 00:01:35,034
initiated just a huge boom in sales and 
the market followed as it always does 

25
00:01:39,691 --> 00:01:40,524
when something works.
Record stores were refigured so that 

26
00:01:43,681 --> 00:01:46,350
instead of just seeing the bindings like
books on a shelf,

27
00:01:46,351 --> 00:01:49,350
consumers were encouraged to flip 
through the covers.

28
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:50,483
This all points to just how important 
the cover art was to the marketing of 

29
00:01:54,421 --> 00:01:57,720
the product.
And music is a product.

30
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:02,820
It's a commodity that people consume and
since you can't buy the band itself,

31
00:02:02,821 --> 00:02:06,000
and since the music has no spacial 
dimension,

32
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:11,330
the album cover emerged as the standard 
for the commodity to be purchased.

33
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,133
This explains the rise of photography on
album covers and what's called the 

34
00:02:16,591 --> 00:02:17,990
personality cover.
You know,

35
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:21,630
one of those covers where it's just a 
photograph of the band or musician,

36
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,553
still pretty popular today.
A perfect example of this personality 

37
00:02:25,321 --> 00:02:27,870
cover can be seen on the Beatles first 
album.

38
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:28,853
Please,
please meet.

39
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:33,360
Look at those bright smiling faces 
staring warmly into the camera lens.

40
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:37,570
As Susan Sontag once brilliantly said in
its simplest form,

41
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:38,613
we have in a photograph surrogate 
possession of a cherished person or 

42
00:02:43,361 --> 00:02:45,040
thing.
As their career advanced,

43
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:50,070
the Beatles seemed to become darkly 
aware of their status as commodities,

44
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,793
perhaps nowhere more plainly 
acknowledged that on the cover of their 

45
00:02:54,411 --> 00:02:58,040
fourth album,
aptly titled Beatles for sale,

46
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:58,903
featuring another of the personality 
cover this time without the warmth and 

47
00:03:03,011 --> 00:03:03,670
the smiles.

48
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:04,503
By the time sergeant pepper's emerge,
the Beatles had already begun 

49
00:03:07,181 --> 00:03:11,590
challenging the conventions with popular
music and its role in culture,

50
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,350
and this extended to the album covers 
too.

51
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,060
First in rubber soul with it's distorted
image and funky tight face.

52
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,870
Then with revolver for which they 
employed their friend and artists,

53
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,733
Klaus Vorman,
we did a kind of 19 sixties update of 

54
00:03:26,591 --> 00:03:31,040
Victorian illustrator Aubrey beardsley 
famous black ink drawings.

55
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:31,923
In other words,
the Beatles were leaders in expanding 

56
00:03:34,271 --> 00:03:35,104
and album covers function from a 
marketing tool to a work of art in its 

57
00:03:39,371 --> 00:03:40,204
own right,
and that brings us back to what is 

58
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:43,203
really the holy grail of album covers,
the Beatles' sergeant pepper's lonely 

59
00:03:47,891 --> 00:03:48,724
hearts club band,
a cover that explicitly engages the 

60
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:52,624
audience in so many ways and critiques 
and interpretations and comparisons and 

61
00:03:56,681 --> 00:03:57,514
contrasts.
It's a cover that invites you in and a 

62
00:04:00,491 --> 00:04:01,324
perfect example of this is the immediate
challenge to just identify who all of 

63
00:04:05,471 --> 00:04:06,400
these people are.

64
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,413
What do Indian Gurus,
Karl Marx and Bob Dylan all have in 

65
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:12,184
common?
The sergeant pepper's cover once you to 

66
00:04:13,901 --> 00:04:16,240
ask questions like this.
Now,

67
00:04:16,241 --> 00:04:17,230
in one sense,
of course,

68
00:04:17,231 --> 00:04:20,890
these people just represent the Beatles 
interests and influences,

69
00:04:20,891 --> 00:04:25,891
many of whom didn't make the final cut,
and yet by juxtaposing high brow artists

70
00:04:26,351 --> 00:04:27,184
and thinkers like marks or Aubrey 
Beardsley or George Bernard Shaw or 

71
00:04:31,031 --> 00:04:34,420
Dylan Thomas with pop icons like Bob 
Dylan,

72
00:04:34,421 --> 00:04:36,580
Marilyn Monro,
Marlin Brando,

73
00:04:36,581 --> 00:04:37,414
and Shirley temple.
The Beatles signaled the breakdown and 

74
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:41,404
mixing of high and low culture that they
themselves exemplified more than any 

75
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,793
other artist with sergeant pepper.
The Beatles were in a posture of 

76
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:53,710
challenge,
challenging everything they'd been up to

77
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:54,544
that point,
challenging the highbrow art critics to 

78
00:04:56,411 --> 00:04:58,870
abandon their exclusion of popular 
culture,

79
00:04:59,020 --> 00:04:59,853
challenging the listening public to 
engage with something other than love 

80
00:05:03,191 --> 00:05:04,024
songs,
and the same for courts there were even 

81
00:05:05,621 --> 00:05:10,621
challenging the feelings of unity that 
defined the summer of love in 1967,

82
00:05:11,021 --> 00:05:11,854
delivering a suite of songs that 
featured alienation and loss as much as 

83
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:16,774
it did love and togetherness.
The album cover echoes these challenges 

84
00:05:20,741 --> 00:05:24,910
and adds some of its own by using the 
technique of photo montage,

85
00:05:24,911 --> 00:05:29,260
which manipulates photography's unique 
ability to depict reality.

86
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:30,303
The Beatles blend and collapsed the 
values of a number of different times 

87
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:38,410
and places by staging the scene as a 
performance and an audience.

88
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:39,880
The band challenges us to do,

89
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,733
dwell on the function both indeed.
These considerations were at the front 

90
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,113
of their minds as the Beatles had only 
recently elected to stop performing 

91
00:05:48,271 --> 00:05:49,530
live.
After the mayhem,

92
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:54,030
a beatle mania began to diminish the 
quality of music while some accused them

93
00:05:54,031 --> 00:05:55,200
of leaving their fans.

94
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,770
Hi.
The sergeant pepper's cover suggests the

95
00:05:57,771 --> 00:05:58,604
opposite,
that the decision to stop touring was 

96
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,520
out of respect for their fans,
not out of fear or contempt.

97
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,130
We should also note that the designer of
discover,

98
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:07,993
Peter Blake was a noted pop artists,
a style that used aspects of mass 

99
00:06:12,351 --> 00:06:16,040
culture to bring attention to the fuzzy 
lines between art,

100
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,840
advertising,
news,

101
00:06:17,841 --> 00:06:18,674
and all other forms of media.
The pop artists wanted to get people to 

102
00:06:21,711 --> 00:06:22,544
think about the process and 
manufacturing of ar and how it's 

103
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:29,510
categorizations and hierarchies are 
largely arbitrary.

104
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,560
Blake and the Beatles design the 
sergeant pepper cover as both a piece of

105
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:37,100
art and a product inside it's gatefold 
sleeve.

106
00:06:37,101 --> 00:06:37,934
The record had paper cutouts of the 
pepper bans regalia adding to its 

107
00:06:41,361 --> 00:06:42,194
consumer kitsch value,
and yet it was also the first album to 

108
00:06:45,261 --> 00:06:49,850
display the lyrics on the packaging,
encouraging listeners to interrogate the

109
00:06:49,851 --> 00:06:52,700
records,
intellectual content as well.

110
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:53,913
The truth is,
of course that music perhaps more 

111
00:06:55,461 --> 00:06:56,294
prominently than any other art form,
plays both parts as a commodity and an 

112
00:07:01,581 --> 00:07:02,414
aesthetic object,
and in many ways the two functions are 

113
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:05,923
inseparable.
The Beatles knew this and maybe they 

114
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:09,344
regretted it,
but they were self aware enough to see 

115
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,313
that it was inescapable and if music had
to be marketed and if the visual was 

116
00:07:15,801 --> 00:07:18,050
going to be the vehicle of that John,
Paul,

117
00:07:18,051 --> 00:07:18,884
George,
and Ringo were going to be as playful 

118
00:07:20,751 --> 00:07:24,180
here they were with everything else.
In the end,

119
00:07:24,181 --> 00:07:25,014
this photograph of photographs levels a 
critique on representation itself to 

120
00:07:30,571 --> 00:07:33,540
show how music is mediated by the 
visual.

121
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:34,523
The Beatles put themselves on this cover
three times once as the wax figures of 

122
00:07:39,271 --> 00:07:40,104
the mop top beetles that they were once 
as the fake pepper band and it's bright 

123
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:44,783
and eye catching glory and finally as 
themselves pictured not on the cover of 

124
00:07:49,681 --> 00:07:50,514
their album,
but by the effects of that cover in the 

125
00:07:52,501 --> 00:07:57,501
minds of everyone who looked at the real
Beatles can't be represented this way.

126
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:02,010
Not really not like this or like this or
like this.

127
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:07,460
The cover of sergeant pepper's lonely 
hearts club band points to the truth.

128
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,873
What the Beatles themselves knew that 
all music is invisible then in the news 

129
00:08:18,091 --> 00:08:20,840
today.
