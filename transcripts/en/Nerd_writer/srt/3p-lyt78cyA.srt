1
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:15,843
One consequence of Hollywood being 
dominated by superheroes and franchises 

2
00:00:18,911 --> 00:00:22,570
is that by the time you're my age,
you've seen about 6,000

3
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,210
action,
second summer spectacular.

4
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:26,523
Many are not,
and it's pretty easy to distinguish 

5
00:00:31,001 --> 00:00:31,834
between the two because the reaction is 
physical as adrenaline being released 

6
00:00:34,751 --> 00:00:38,270
into your system or not,
are you gripping your armrest or not?

7
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:39,663
After watching all these set pieces,
I think we've sort of been forced to 

8
00:00:41,981 --> 00:00:44,440
develop an intuitive sophistication 
about them.

9
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:45,573
There are no shortcuts to thrilling and 
audience that's absolutely drowning in 

10
00:00:48,881 --> 00:00:52,180
this stuff.
We recognize and champion good work when

11
00:00:52,181 --> 00:00:55,180
we see and feel it.
I think that's the secret to the success

12
00:00:55,181 --> 00:00:58,180
of franchises like mission impossible,
fast and furious,

13
00:00:58,390 --> 00:00:59,223
and John Wick.
These are movies that are committed to 

14
00:01:01,151 --> 00:01:03,100
weld,
choreographed well edited,

15
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:05,590
real action,
okay.

16
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:06,943
Not always.
Real cruise understands exactly what 

17
00:01:11,091 --> 00:01:13,820
he's offering.
The three or four genuinely creative set

18
00:01:13,821 --> 00:01:14,654
pieces with a serviceable plot that 
doesn't take itself too seriously and a 

19
00:01:17,331 --> 00:01:18,164
few charismatic actors can be a really 
fun movie going experience well worth 

20
00:01:21,621 --> 00:01:22,360
the price of.

21
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,193
Okay.

22
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:26,263
In fact,
this formula I think in many ways 

23
00:01:28,041 --> 00:01:31,190
defines the strategy of the marvel 
cinematic universe.

24
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,870
Some of those movies are undoubtedly 
better than this.

25
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:34,723
Some unfortunately worse,
but they've tried their best to hew to 

26
00:01:37,851 --> 00:01:40,130
this baseline and I think it's worked 
out pretty well for them.

27
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,890
Anyone else?
Every ingredient matters of course,

28
00:01:42,891 --> 00:01:46,950
but the marvel set pieces have been 
really consistent by enlarge and they're

29
00:01:46,951 --> 00:01:47,784
probably the things that I remember most
when I think back on these movies now I 

30
00:01:51,501 --> 00:01:54,710
know there's a certain amount of fatigue
these days about superhero films.

31
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,750
I feel that way too.
More and more,

32
00:01:56,751 --> 00:01:57,584
but you know,
if I ever think back to my expectations 

33
00:01:58,971 --> 00:02:02,300
as a kid for what big screen superhero 
team up fights would be like.

34
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:03,883
I mean,
there's definitely exceeds the laws of 

35
00:02:07,521 --> 00:02:08,354
physics at all.
There's a lot going on here that you 

36
00:02:09,741 --> 00:02:13,790
don't understand that.
The sad part about this is that as a kid

37
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,520
I read DC comics,
not marvel comics,

38
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:17,653
and unfortunately the DC extended 
universe set pieces leave a lot to be 

39
00:02:21,921 --> 00:02:22,754
desired.

40
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:28,910
There are a lot of reasons for this,
I think that people have explored before

41
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:29,773
Zack Snyder's preference for stylized 
coloring versus the more muted 

42
00:02:32,991 --> 00:02:33,824
cinematography of the mcu.
The overuse of super slow motion and 

43
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,090
ridiculous virtual camera moves like 
this,

44
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,143
but there are a few other things I want 
to point out that I think make a bigger 

45
00:02:46,461 --> 00:02:48,770
difference when it comes to superhero 
set pieces.

46
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:49,873
The first is that physics matters,
but we all know that superheroes do a 

47
00:02:53,571 --> 00:02:56,990
lot of absurd things.
Half the shots that iron man takes would

48
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:57,893
he fatal blows,
but people have an intuitive sense for 

49
00:03:01,331 --> 00:03:02,164
weight and velocity impact,
which is why in camera action usually 

50
00:03:05,891 --> 00:03:07,990
get some more visceral response from 
audiences.

51
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:12,460
The physics are absolutely real.
This doesn't mean that all CGI is bad,

52
00:03:12,461 --> 00:03:13,294
but if you're going to use CGI,
it's a good idea to pay a lot of 

53
00:03:15,311 --> 00:03:17,320
attention to the cues that people pick 
up.

54
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,420
And then the first set piece of winter 
soldier,

55
00:03:19,421 --> 00:03:20,254
for example,
the Russo brothers do a great job at 

56
00:03:22,301 --> 00:03:26,380
gauging captain America strength level 
for the audience with only a few shots.

57
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:27,603
They lace these in with real hand to 
hand combat to enhance the realism or 

58
00:03:31,061 --> 00:03:31,894
take spiderman heavily CG character.
It's easy to establish his physics 

59
00:03:34,901 --> 00:03:35,734
because he's swinging on elastic bands 
and it's a different type of physics 

60
00:03:39,911 --> 00:03:43,930
than Iron Mans or the hoax.
Too often in DC movies,

61
00:03:43,931 --> 00:03:44,764
the physics just don't matter,
or the camera is doing something that 

62
00:03:47,831 --> 00:03:51,910
makes everything feel weightless.
Taking away the real force of a punch.

63
00:03:51,911 --> 00:03:52,744
For example,
I don't even understand the physics of 

64
00:03:53,981 --> 00:03:54,814
how my toes and there's not enough 
difference between the heroes for the 

65
00:04:00,311 --> 00:04:03,070
audience to really feel the power 
levels.

66
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,880
Nothing is graceful or tactical.
It's all just brute force.

67
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,690
Which brings me to my second point is 
scan st agnes.

68
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:15,060
Use powers creatively,
first time for everything.

69
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,153
Angela.

70
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,023
It's not always the case,
but there's a good number of times in 

71
00:04:22,121 --> 00:04:22,954
the marvel movies where powers interact 
off of one another in ways that you 

72
00:04:26,171 --> 00:04:29,230
can't predict how our full hundred 
percent capacity.

73
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,033
How about that?
Or they take something routine like 

74
00:04:34,661 --> 00:04:39,661
someone bailing from a car and just go 
the extra step to DC films.

75
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:46,630
Every character is a blunt instrument,
only doing the most obvious thing,

76
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:47,943
which in Superman's case is usually.
This frustrates me so much because 

77
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:53,374
superman has a laundry list of powers.
There has to be some way for him to 

78
00:04:57,101 --> 00:05:01,420
combine them in a creative way to solve 
a problem or defeat a clever villain.

79
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:04,090
I know a good filmmaker can figure it 
out.

80
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,850
Finally,
the one thing that marvel is really good

81
00:05:06,851 --> 00:05:07,684
at is the ability to slip character 
moments into the cracks of big set 

82
00:05:11,201 --> 00:05:14,110
pieces.
Every action scene has its pauses.

83
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:14,944
When everything stops in the characters,
get to say a line or two for the simple 

84
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:19,043
things like how much this is.
Here are the things that marvel 

85
00:05:22,691 --> 00:05:24,130
character set on those pauses.

86
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,880
Bulk funding meets you guys be more 
handsome and taking on a squadron,

87
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:38,910
and he didn't invite me,
man,

88
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:44,050
who was laden with Alaska one time where
you're from Queens,

89
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,093
Brooklyn.
Now here are the things that DC 

90
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:57,240
characters say.
I'm going to stop here.

91
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,370
You ever estimate through,
so we'll see about that.

92
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:08,420
Next time they shine your light in the 
sky.

93
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,313
Don't go into crafting good set pieces,
won't solve all the problems plaguing 

94
00:06:19,221 --> 00:06:22,280
the EU.
They can't make for a good movie alone,

95
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:23,863
but I think you'd be surprised how much 
people forgive when they've had a 

96
00:06:26,691 --> 00:06:29,510
genuinely bracing experience at the 
theater.

97
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,390
Eventually the people behind the DC,
you.

98
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:36,500
We'll figure it out until then.
I'm afraid it's just going to be a whole

99
00:06:36,501 --> 00:06:37,334
lot of this.

100
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:05,810
