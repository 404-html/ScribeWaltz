00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,790
Hey everybody,
welcome back and coffee on a Tuesday and

2
00:00:02,791 --> 00:00:03,624
blog.
Fifty three.

3
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:14,900
Okay.

4
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,510
Here's the story,
and the theory in the 15th century,

5
00:00:17,511 --> 00:00:18,344
a dynastic civil war known today as the 
war of the roses resulted in the 

6
00:00:21,801 --> 00:00:25,550
annihilation of virtually every member 
of the British aristocracy.

7
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,400
In the end,
it was henry tutor,

8
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,273
distant cousin of the Lancaster family,
who in 1485 ascended to become king 

9
00:00:32,691 --> 00:00:34,190
henry the seventh.
Now,

10
00:00:34,191 --> 00:00:35,024
to keep order,
Henry has to build himself and 

11
00:00:36,351 --> 00:00:37,184
aristocracy.
The only problem is all the royals are 

12
00:00:39,171 --> 00:00:40,580
dead.
So what does he do?

13
00:00:40,581 --> 00:00:42,950
He pulls people up from the petty 
nobility,

14
00:00:42,951 --> 00:00:43,784
the lower classes,
and by introducing social mobility to 

15
00:00:46,401 --> 00:00:47,234
Western society,
he initiates what is arguably the most 

16
00:00:49,221 --> 00:00:51,800
important movement in all of human 
history.

17
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:53,343
Maternity.
It might be hard to imagine since it's 

18
00:00:54,531 --> 00:00:56,840
so much a part of our lives today,
but before this,

19
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:57,793
social stratification was rigidly fixed.
You were born into a class and you 

20
00:01:01,191 --> 00:01:02,024
stayed there for life,
and as the hierarchy was determined by 

21
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:05,264
God,
people literally thought it was 

22
00:01:06,621 --> 00:01:08,690
impossible to change their status.

23
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:09,523
The providential plan was the 
providential plans that old henry know 

24
00:01:11,961 --> 00:01:12,870
what he was doing.
No,

25
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:13,813
he was acting out of necessity,
but all of a sudden what the public 

26
00:01:15,861 --> 00:01:19,280
thought was impossible was happening 
right in front of their eyes.

27
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:22,550
A massive change in culture for many a 
positive one,

28
00:01:22,551 --> 00:01:23,384
and because it was so positive,
people began to reorganize the rules of 

29
00:01:27,261 --> 00:01:28,094
their symbolic reality to accommodate.
I talked more about symbolic reality in 

30
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:34,580
blog 46 time.
Essentially it's the symbols in logic by

31
00:01:34,581 --> 00:01:37,100
which we live our lives.
For the first time in history,

32
00:01:37,101 --> 00:01:39,980
the word nation became synonymous with 
the word people.

33
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:42,950
People began to govern themselves,
make their own laws,

34
00:01:42,951 --> 00:01:47,240
and God steadily lost influence in both 
political and human affairs,

35
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:49,430
but in the midst of all these positive 
changes,

36
00:01:49,431 --> 00:01:53,150
something very dark and very troubling 
was stirring beneath the surface.

37
00:01:53,151 --> 00:01:53,984
The world's very first mental 
institution place called Bedlam in 

38
00:01:56,661 --> 00:01:58,850
London,
began to take on more and more.

39
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:01,490
Patients cries,
so hideous and so great.

40
00:02:01,491 --> 00:02:03,950
Show the inner walls.
According to one resident,

41
00:02:03,951 --> 00:02:05,360
what was happening?
Well,

42
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:06,373
the widespread psychological diseases we
know today as manic depression and 

43
00:02:09,771 --> 00:02:10,604
schizophrenia were being diagnosed for 
the very first time in feudal England 

44
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,780
society where your lot in life was 
ordained by God personal crises.

45
00:02:17,781 --> 00:02:20,420
What undermines these illnesses were 
uncommon.

46
00:02:20,421 --> 00:02:21,254
You can't really fail at what you are 
because your identity in a system like 

47
00:02:24,201 --> 00:02:26,720
that was secured at birth in the new 
system,

48
00:02:26,721 --> 00:02:29,330
the system of social mobility and 
ambitious.

49
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:32,180
Another word that enters common usage at
that time,

50
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:33,403
choice becomes a part of the equation.
The responsibility falls off God's 

51
00:02:36,641 --> 00:02:37,474
shoulders and onto your.
Suddenly you can fail at becoming what 

52
00:02:40,641 --> 00:02:43,250
you want to become with no one to blame,
but you.

53
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,980
This was the bittersweet upshot of the 
new modern well.

54
00:02:45,981 --> 00:02:49,040
Many were reaping the positive rewards 
of climbing the social ladder.

55
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:52,730
Others were plunging into personal 
crises by failing to do so.

56
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,830
No longer secured by the class of your 
birth.

57
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:57,380
Personal identity needed something to 
balance out.

58
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,360
The dark side of modernity.
Enter will shakespeare.

59
00:03:01,361 --> 00:03:04,500
When new worlds are birthed from boulder
failings,

60
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:08,470
new logics fill the vacuum from pieces 
made of the old.

61
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:12,820
It takes an imagination of a truly great
stature to see and think through,

62
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,833
in essence,
create the principles by which the rest 

63
00:03:16,001 --> 00:03:18,070
of us can live our lives in the new 
world,

64
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:22,930
that kind of person,
the rarest of rare we call genius around

65
00:03:22,931 --> 00:03:25,480
1593.
At the height of this cultural upheaval,

66
00:03:25,481 --> 00:03:28,630
Shakespeare writes Romeo and Juliet.
In this play,

67
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,613
we have basically the rule book.
The best definition of what we know 

68
00:03:32,951 --> 00:03:33,784
today as low no texts before this 
elevates love is such an incredible 

69
00:03:37,481 --> 00:03:38,314
height.
No texts is it the same quality and 

70
00:03:39,881 --> 00:03:43,640
value in language,
the most important of symbolic system.

71
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:44,503
Shakespeare's mine was an 
extraordinarily close coordination with 

72
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:47,794
the world around him.
He could see what was happening to the 

73
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:52,030
people of London,
the city like most cities played host to

74
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:52,864
a number of the mentally disabled,
most of whom had nowhere to go and so 

75
00:03:55,481 --> 00:03:56,314
remain homeless.
Shakespeare sees it all and we get 

76
00:03:58,631 --> 00:03:59,464
amazing diagnostic insights into these 
conditions in place like King Lear and 

77
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:05,920
handled in Romeo and Juliet.
He offers a solution.

78
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,540
Love the poet,
writes and signup.

79
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,810
One 16 is the star to every wandering 
bark.

80
00:04:10,811 --> 00:04:14,050
In other words,
the north star to every wandering mind.

81
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,033
Shakespeare effectively establishes,
loves transformative power of power for 

82
00:04:18,851 --> 00:04:21,960
the average citizen that it did not have
before.

83
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:22,794
This kind of love is identity affirmed.
To find a Romeo or Juliet is to find 

84
00:04:26,561 --> 00:04:27,394
someone who will reinforce your own 
positive identity as a person in love 

85
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:33,010
and extremely powerful symbolic logic.

86
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:33,843
It's power,
evidence by the sheer turmoil of 

87
00:04:35,951 --> 00:04:36,784
heartbreak and Shakespeare being a 
writer for the common man makes it 

88
00:04:38,951 --> 00:04:41,650
something that is a clickable to anyone,
rich or poor.

89
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:45,700
Wherever you stand in the now chaotic 
social hierarchy in essence,

90
00:04:45,701 --> 00:04:46,534
and as you know it,
Shakespeare invented low down the 

91
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:51,063
generations.
We can see the impact Shakespeare has 

92
00:04:52,031 --> 00:04:52,864
done more to define the current reality 
still than any other person or group of 

93
00:04:56,741 --> 00:04:57,574
people since he brought the culture into
his mind at a critical historical 

94
00:05:00,941 --> 00:05:01,774
moment,
dissected it thought through the logic 

95
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,170
and expressed it for all of us in 
achingly beautiful verse.

96
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:08,043
Now,
you may wonder about texts like the 

97
00:05:09,221 --> 00:05:10,054
Odyssey or Plato's symposium or Dante 
via Nova because there are accounts in 

98
00:05:13,811 --> 00:05:17,320
those of love,
or it may nag at you that if what I said

99
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:20,470
is true,
that love is somehow a sham.

100
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:21,363
As for those texts,
it's perhaps worth it to say that both 

101
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:25,880
affection and love were around before 
Shakespeare,

102
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:28,510
but the quality of love as we conceive 
of it today,

103
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,553
the Hollywood ness of it,
the applicability to all the identity 

104
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,633
affirming power is I think what 
Shakespeare brought into the culture as 

105
00:05:35,581 --> 00:05:37,240
for feeling that love is a sham.

106
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:38,283
You shouldn't.
What you feel today when you're in love 

107
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:40,773
is completely and totally real,
and the identity of firming power of it 

108
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,480
is real to this is how symbolic reality 
works.

109
00:05:46,481 --> 00:05:47,314
It changes over time and what's real to 
you and the culture at large is what's 

110
00:05:51,971 --> 00:05:52,804
real.
Shakespeare is not a genius because of 

111
00:05:53,861 --> 00:05:54,694
his intelligence.
He's a genius because of his powerful 

112
00:05:56,651 --> 00:05:59,150
imagination,
his symbolic imagination,

113
00:05:59,151 --> 00:05:59,984
his ability to bound through steps of 
emerging logics and workout new 

114
00:06:02,901 --> 00:06:05,810
conclusions.
What's incredible is that we all possess

115
00:06:05,811 --> 00:06:09,530
the exact same ability.
That's the spectacular interplay between

116
00:06:09,531 --> 00:06:13,550
culture and the mind.
The ladder can revolutionize the former.

117
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,413
We have only to take those symbols back 
into our mind and like the great man 

118
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:19,663
think them through again.
I have to thank my sociology professor 

119
00:06:28,191 --> 00:06:31,190
from b.
You lay a Greenfeld who introduced me to

120
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:35,720
these ideas of symbolic reality and this
crazy theory about shakespeare.

121
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,780
I'll put a link in the description where
you can read more from her.

122
00:06:38,781 --> 00:06:40,520
She's really,
truly incredible.

123
00:06:40,521 --> 00:06:42,470
Also,
don't forget to subscribe if you haven't

124
