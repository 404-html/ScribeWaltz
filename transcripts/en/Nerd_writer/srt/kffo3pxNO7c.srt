1
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:11,980
I carry your heart with me,
high county it in my home.

2
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,210
I'm never without it.
Anywhere I go,

3
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,193
you go.
My idea and whatever is done by only me 

4
00:00:21,501 --> 00:00:26,501
is your doing my daughter.
I fear no fate for you are my fate,

5
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:33,590
my suite.
I want no world war.

6
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:35,930
Beautiful.
You are my world,

7
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,393
my crew and h you a whatever a moon has 
always meant and whatever his son will 

8
00:00:44,271 --> 00:00:49,271
always saying is you.
Here is the deepest secret.

9
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:54,173
Nobody knows.
Here is the root of the root and the 

10
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:03,990
Bardo,
the bug and the sky and the sky.

11
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:09,020
The tree called light which grows higher
than so ken,

12
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,760
Whoa or mind can hide,
and this is the one.

13
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:26,010
It's keeping the stars a park.
I carry your heart.

14
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,250
I carry it in my house

15
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:35,960
of all the many highly experimental 
poems by e,

16
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,070
e Dot Cummings.
I carry your heart with me.

17
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:44,110
I carry it in is among the most 
straightforward and approachable.

18
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:48,340
It's the one you're most likely to hear 
at weddings or at weddings.

19
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,070
In romcoms.
I carry your heart with me.

20
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:57,070
I carry it in my heart and because this 
poem seems effortless,

21
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,233
it feels pulled out of time too.
I think that was what I wanted to make 

22
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:02,704
this poem,
universal quintessential love poem for 

23
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,880
the Modern Age.
I mean,

24
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:10,540
just take a look at the five concrete 
images that he uses.

25
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:12,340
Hearts,
Moon,

26
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,740
Sun,
tree stars.

27
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,430
It's hard to imagine five symbols more 
archetypal,

28
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,330
so the intention here is clearly 
universal appeal,

29
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:23,583
but that's not a slight on the poems.
Construction or it's meaning just the 

30
00:02:27,071 --> 00:02:27,970
opposite.
In fact,

31
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,840
as Yates once brilliantly wrote about 
his own craft,

32
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:37,390
align will take us hours maybe yet if it
does not seem a moment's thought,

33
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:40,660
our stitching and unsticking has been 
not.

34
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:42,011
So.
First,

35
00:02:42,011 --> 00:02:45,220
let's take a look at the formal 
construction of I carry your heart.

36
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:46,323
The first thing to notice is that the 
poem is split into two overlapping 

37
00:02:49,421 --> 00:02:50,254
parts.
Everything that's outside the 

38
00:02:52,001 --> 00:02:54,520
parentheses and everything that's inside
them.

39
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:57,610
This follows the theme setup in the 
first line,

40
00:02:57,611 --> 00:02:58,444
the theme of the narrators lover being 
contained within his heart and vice 

41
00:03:02,621 --> 00:03:05,320
versa.
This reciprocal relationship is hammered

42
00:03:05,321 --> 00:03:08,200
home in the first stanza with anywhere I
go,

43
00:03:08,201 --> 00:03:12,250
you go and whatever is done by only me 
is your doing.

44
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:13,923
Every statement in this poem is followed
by a parent theoretical statement and 

45
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:21,850
frequently keywords used outside of them
are found inside as well.

46
00:03:21,851 --> 00:03:24,130
Linking the two parts and the two 
people.

47
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,413
Parentheses are the perfect punctuation 
to use because visually they actually 

48
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:32,390
represent the image of containment.
It's critic Roy.

49
00:03:32,391 --> 00:03:33,224
Tarkovsky has observed cummings find 
several poetic functions from the 

50
00:03:36,821 --> 00:03:37,654
parentheses throughout his work,
whether it's to convey intimacy or 

51
00:03:40,751 --> 00:03:45,550
protection or to give a direct address 
to the subject or like we just discussed

52
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,450
to use it's crescent shape as an icon in
itself.

53
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,793
The neatest Tarkovsky notes,
parentheses have a somewhat 

54
00:03:52,961 --> 00:03:56,200
contradictory place and all our writing 
formally,

55
00:03:56,201 --> 00:03:57,034
they're supposed to contain throwaway 
information stuff that would 

56
00:03:59,741 --> 00:04:03,130
theoretically be perfectly okay to leave
out what?

57
00:04:03,131 --> 00:04:03,964
Because of this,
because they don't have to be there and 

58
00:04:06,101 --> 00:04:06,934
yet still our parents political comments
call attention to themselves for 

59
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,380
grounding their content swell,
backgrounding them at the same time.

60
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:15,573
Ambiguity like that is exactly what 
cummings loves to play with and it 

61
00:04:19,391 --> 00:04:21,220
reinforces the poems,
themes.

62
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:24,700
Clearly Cummings is using the parents 
medicals for intimacy.

63
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,550
You can see that in his additions of my 
dear,

64
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:28,900
my darling,
my suite,

65
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:29,734
my true,
but he also uses them to develop his 

66
00:04:31,781 --> 00:04:34,740
philosophy of self and love.
See,

67
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:35,583
for Cummings,
love is a condition in which to 

68
00:04:37,181 --> 00:04:38,014
fragmented selves come together to form 
a more perfect unity and if there's one 

69
00:04:42,101 --> 00:04:42,934
great theme in his collected work,
it's the importance of being a truly 

70
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:51,030
transcendental he alive individual 
against the doling and alienating forces

71
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:52,323
of modern progress,
but the individual self was always a 

72
00:04:55,031 --> 00:04:56,860
problematic idea for cummings.

73
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:57,843
Whereas sometimes he evolved.
That man is a miraculously whole human 

74
00:05:00,911 --> 00:05:03,850
being elsewhere.
Like in the same sentence,

75
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:09,060
he says that man's only happiness is to 
transcend himself again and again.

76
00:05:09,281 --> 00:05:14,281
His poetry affirms that transcendence 
comes with losing the self in love.

77
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:17,950
Whether it said gracefully outright,
like when he writes,

78
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,173
losing through you what seemed myself,
I find selves unimaginably mine or it's 

79
00:05:26,261 --> 00:05:27,094
demonstrated in some formal fireworks 
like in this poem where the you and me 

80
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,373
is literally fused together and the 
speaker has difficulty determining what 

81
00:05:36,281 --> 00:05:37,114
form of the verb is best to use.
Loves ability to transcend is the focus 

82
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:46,260
of I carrier heart and cummings is using
whatever he can to explore it.

83
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:50,890
Different connotations of transcendence.
Just take a look at the third stanza.

84
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:55,570
Love is literally a cosmic force that 
holds the stars in the firmament,

85
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:57,003
but it's also the deepest secret and 
coming suggests this deepness by 

86
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,680
nesting,
the secret in parentheses,

87
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,320
which are themselves nested into the 
poem,

88
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,393
and the secret is buried further in the 
root of the root and the bud of the bud 

89
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:15,620
and the symbols I mentioned earlier,
son and particularly moon,

90
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,680
are symbols of transcendence throughout 
his poetry.

91
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:19,783
I mean what has the moon always meant to
cummings in a great essay by cummings 

92
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:25,920
critic Martin Hooser,
which I'll link to below the moon.

93
00:06:25,921 --> 00:06:28,130
Significance is traced across several 
poems.

94
00:06:28,131 --> 00:06:31,580
It's variously described as a remarkable
splinter,

95
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:34,430
dainty madden was watch spring,
a balloon,

96
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:38,780
a big red dog mystery as having small 
hands,

97
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:39,863
and as the shyest metaphor,
cummings has a transcendental reverence 

98
00:06:43,521 --> 00:06:44,354
for the moon,
but he has a hard time pinning it down 

99
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:49,700
in language.
That's why it's the shyest metaphor,

100
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:50,534
many then he attempt to understand it,
to know it will result in the symbol 

101
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:54,403
fleeing further away.
This is what the moon has always meant 

102
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:01,180
to cummings and it's the way he feels 
about love and poetry too,

103
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,530
in his notes which are collected at 
Harvard,

104
00:07:03,531 --> 00:07:04,364
he once wrote to know is to possess and 
any fact is possessed by everyone who 

105
00:07:09,081 --> 00:07:09,914
knows it.
Whereas those who feel the truth are 

106
00:07:13,371 --> 00:07:14,204
possessed,
not possessors like the great American 

107
00:07:17,511 --> 00:07:18,344
transcendentalists.
Cummings believes truth in poetry and 

108
00:07:21,171 --> 00:07:26,171
love cannot be comprehended,
only experienced with his poetry and all

109
00:07:27,651 --> 00:07:32,300
its intense experimentation.
He attempts to short circuit our impulse

110
00:07:32,301 --> 00:07:35,630
toward knowing so that we might 
experience language.

111
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:40,740
A new I carry your heart is a rare 
attempt at clarity and form and content.

112
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:46,670
It points toward love just as it points 
toward cummings philosophy,

113
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,103
but it's true.
Magic is in the way it unfolds 

114
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:56,110
effortlessly in a rhythm and cadence.
Harmonious with feeling.

115
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,800
Hey everybody.
Thanks for watching.

116
00:08:01,801 --> 00:08:02,634
I want to point you guys in the 
direction of a channel that I really 

117
00:08:04,591 --> 00:08:05,424
love wisecrack we've been pushing back 
and forth to each other because I think 

118
00:08:08,911 --> 00:08:09,744
if you like my stuff,
you're definitely going to love what 

119
00:08:11,071 --> 00:08:13,140
they do.
They do eight bit philosophy,

120
00:08:13,141 --> 00:08:13,974
thug notes,
but I've really been loving earthling 

121
00:08:15,711 --> 00:08:16,544
cinema,
which is like film analysis from the 

122
00:08:18,271 --> 00:08:22,170
perspective of a crabby but hilarious 
earthling from the future.

123
00:08:22,171 --> 00:08:22,750
I'm a,
I don't know.

124
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,440
I'm a sucker for high concept stuff and 
it's really smart.

125
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:26,230
Um,
anyway,

126
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:28,740
go to their channel.
Watch this one that they just did on Mad

127
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:29,700
Max,
which is really good.

128
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:30,703
Um,
and subscribe and tell them the nerd 

129
00:08:32,251 --> 00:08:33,950
writer sent you in comments.
Um,

130
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,371
yeah,
they're,

131
00:08:34,371 --> 00:08:35,610
they're just good people.
Uh,

132
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:36,340
anyway,
if you want to,

133
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,330
to the nerd writer directly,
you can click right here.

134
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,720
Go to my patrion.
Um,

135
00:08:39,721 --> 00:08:43,350
I just started a blog on patriots.
So if you a pledge dollar per video,

136
00:08:43,351 --> 00:08:45,180
you can get access to that,
some behind the scenes stuff.

137
00:08:45,181 --> 00:08:46,110
That's cool.
Um,

138
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,300
anyway,
I'll see you guys next Wednesday.
