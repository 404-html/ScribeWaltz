1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,790
I'm putting together a team,
people with special abilities and see,

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:05,920
I believe enemies are coming

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:07,213
right there.
I'm in are now that the justice league 

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,433
trailer is out and it has jokes.
It was a lot of talk about dcs course 

5
00:00:17,211 --> 00:00:18,044
correction as if the overly grim tone of
Batman v Superman was the key to why 

6
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:25,460
wasn't that good of a movie,
but from my point of view,

7
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:26,443
Zack Snyder could make justice league 
and out and out comedy and it still 

8
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:34,200
wouldn't fix what I see as a more 
fundamental problem in his filmmaking.

9
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,010
Something that's really apparent in 
Batman versus superman.

10
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,070
His preoccupation,
his obsession with moments,

11
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,280
the expense of scenes.
What do I mean by this?

12
00:00:44,281 --> 00:00:45,114
Well,
let me start by saying this movie 

13
00:00:46,411 --> 00:00:51,060
moments are awesome.
Really great moment can be transcendent.

14
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:55,440
They can leave deep lifelong visual 
impressions on a film goer.

15
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,080
They can come to represent a whole new 
category of feeling.

16
00:00:58,081 --> 00:00:58,914
That's why film geeks like me reference 
them so much in conversation with 

17
00:01:02,851 --> 00:01:06,210
friends when you were a film student,
at least when I was a film student.

18
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:07,223
That's what makes things exciting.
Most of the student films I directed 

19
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:13,980
revolved around a few moments that I 
thought were going to blow people away.

20
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,290
If I could just navigate the story 
there,

21
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:19,350
that would be enough.
The moment would do all the work.

22
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,560
Then I just navigate to the next one.
For this reason,

23
00:01:22,561 --> 00:01:26,700
my student films weren't that good.
Batman v Superman,

24
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:29,700
dawn of justice,
I think suffers from a similar problem.

25
00:01:29,701 --> 00:01:32,610
Zack Snyder is obviously obsessed with 
moments.

26
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:33,643
The movie is chock full of that moments 
when time is slowed down in the 

27
00:01:36,601 --> 00:01:37,434
composition is just right moments when 
the score swells in the film tries to 

28
00:01:40,951 --> 00:01:43,200
broadcast a single message.

29
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,870
A lot of people talk about Snyder as a 
great visual stylist will.

30
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:49,883
Of course he is.
That's where all the focus goes toward 

31
00:01:52,381 --> 00:01:55,140
crafting moments.
They say his character,

32
00:01:55,141 --> 00:01:55,974
his lack motivation.
Of course they do because all character 

33
00:01:58,891 --> 00:02:01,500
motivations are subservient to the 
films.

34
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,393
Own motivation to reach the next moment.
It makes sense then that Snyder puts 

35
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:10,650
extraordinary care into.
Montage is twice in this film,

36
00:02:10,651 --> 00:02:15,180
the opening credits featuring Batman's 
origin story and at the 44 minute mark,

37
00:02:15,181 --> 00:02:17,910
spotlighting superman's more impressive 
heroics.

38
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:18,983
We have slow motion moment montage,
plus there are something like 40 shots 

39
00:02:23,401 --> 00:02:27,990
in these montages together and they all 
aim to be iconic.

40
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,780
I think of Snyder could make a whole 
movie like this.

41
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,640
He would.
Oh wait,

42
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,540
he already did.
Yes.

43
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:42,880
It's also why he favors dream sequences 
and flashbacks.

44
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,630
More excuses to show more moments.
What that meant,

45
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:50,470
superman really lacks is scenes.
Actual scenes,

46
00:02:50,471 --> 00:02:51,304
not just filler between moments.
Scenes are hard to define since they're 

47
00:02:54,761 --> 00:02:57,400
so malleable.
It's hard to say what one is,

48
00:02:57,401 --> 00:02:58,234
but what a good scene does is dissolve 
the actors and the soundstage and the 

49
00:03:02,531 --> 00:03:07,060
costumes and makeup and camera angle 
into a living and breathing reality.

50
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:10,090
We should be a strong sense of place,
of feeling,

51
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,953
of possibility that the characters who 
inhabit the space could go anywhere 

52
00:03:14,231 --> 00:03:15,700
within it,
even if they don't.

53
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:16,623
Even if you know that the technicalities
of lighting and blocking wouldn't let 

54
00:03:19,721 --> 00:03:21,100
them.
In other words,

55
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:21,993
the discreet elements that make up a 
good scene should not feel like they're 

56
00:03:24,911 --> 00:03:29,500
in service to something else.
Even though they are too often in Batman

57
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:30,334
v Superman,
the characters feel awkwardly placed in 

58
00:03:32,771 --> 00:03:33,604
their scenes.

59
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,593
I mean,
does anyone get the sense that Clark 

60
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:37,323
Kent,
Lois Lane or Perry white actually spend 

61
00:03:38,921 --> 00:03:42,820
time as a daily planet?
We visit the daily planet eight times in

62
00:03:42,821 --> 00:03:43,654
the movie,
but the longest scene there is only a 

63
00:03:44,771 --> 00:03:48,670
minute and 11 seconds.
The rest are under a minute and half are

64
00:03:48,671 --> 00:03:51,190
under 30 seconds.
This doesn't feel like a place.

65
00:03:51,191 --> 00:03:55,840
It feels like a fraction of a location 
where people say things like this.

66
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,330
When the planet was founded,
it stood for something period.

67
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:01,510
The Bat Cave and Clark's apartment,
Lex Luthor is office.

68
00:04:01,511 --> 00:04:02,344
The kryptonians ship all have the same 
issue and that's just about the extent 

69
00:04:05,231 --> 00:04:07,810
of the settings that we visit more than 
once in the film.

70
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,630
What's more of these scenes are filmed 
largely in medium shots,

71
00:04:10,631 --> 00:04:14,350
closeups or extreme closeups,
which makes it even harder to ground the

72
00:04:14,351 --> 00:04:17,110
scenes or for the audience to ground 
itself within them.

73
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:21,430
When in all these places,
we spend an awful lot of time looking at

74
00:04:21,431 --> 00:04:22,264
screens.
There's also very little distinction 

75
00:04:24,281 --> 00:04:25,114
between metropolis and Gotham,
the two cities that sculpted their 

76
00:04:27,761 --> 00:04:30,730
respective heroes.
If you're looking for a metaphor for the

77
00:04:30,731 --> 00:04:31,750
whole film,
Note,

78
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:32,583
the fact that one of the longest scenes 
takes place on an abandoned island 

79
00:04:35,621 --> 00:04:39,190
between the two cities that the heroes 
completely destroyed.

80
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:42,190
Building a good scene isn't only about 
location,

81
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,053
it's about fitting the dialogue,
the tone and the characters into that 

82
00:04:46,211 --> 00:04:49,420
location and endowing it with a sense of
duration.

83
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,740
Avengers,
age of ultron,

84
00:04:50,741 --> 00:04:52,630
from last year.
It isn't a perfect movie,

85
00:04:52,631 --> 00:04:57,130
but there's a great story about how just
and fought to keep the Hawkeye farmhouse

86
00:04:57,131 --> 00:05:00,320
scene in the film that slow paced,
confident,

87
00:05:00,321 --> 00:05:05,200
seen runs for a full 16 minutes right in
the middle of the action and when you're

88
00:05:05,201 --> 00:05:07,840
there,
you're not waiting to go somewhere else.

89
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:08,703
You're there learning about the 
characters and when those characters 

90
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:15,700
have their moments later in the film,
they land with poignancy.

91
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:17,830
Of course,
almost all films,

92
00:05:17,831 --> 00:05:18,664
especially Superhero blockbusters,
are going to have expositional scenes 

93
00:05:21,431 --> 00:05:24,760
and scenes that set up future action and
in great movies,

94
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,713
all the scenes often work together to 
participate in an overarching tone or a 

95
00:05:28,841 --> 00:05:29,674
complex message.
But great scenes function as their own 

96
00:05:33,161 --> 00:05:38,161
little universes within a film and good 
movies should have plenty of them.

97
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:39,663
That meant be superman runs for two and 
a half hours with a heaping helping of 

98
00:05:43,061 --> 00:05:43,894
big moments,
and yet I don't quite feel like I've 

99
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:47,943
been anywhere.
The scene is where all is loaded into 

100
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:52,384
the chamber.
Firing the gun without loading can only 

101
00:05:54,461 --> 00:05:56,860
result in empty noise,
a bang,

102
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:57,853
but no impact.
I'm always hopeful about new superman 

103
00:06:00,921 --> 00:06:03,620
movies because superman is so important 
to me,

104
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:07,160
but I won't let some Batman Jokes and 
upbeat rock music.

105
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,053
For me,
light heartedness isn't the basic 

106
00:06:10,071 --> 00:06:15,071
problem that needs to be fixed here.
The overused and unearned moment is DC's

107
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,113
greatest foe.

108
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,560
Hey guys,
you know I.

109
00:06:21,561 --> 00:06:23,590
I couldn't resist doing a video on 
superman.

110
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:24,424
I just can't resist.
There's a new nerdwriter video every 

111
00:06:27,131 --> 00:06:27,964
Wednesday,
so if you go right there and click that 

112
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,420
subscribe to this channel,
you'll get all of them.

113
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,000
That really helps me out and I gotta 
think squarespace.

114
00:06:34,001 --> 00:06:34,834
We're helping to sponsor this video.
It helped to fund this Shanell without 

115
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:41,500
interfering in the content,
which is just so awesome.

116
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:43,900
They make sleek,
intuitive websites.

117
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,120
You don't have to know coding.
If you sign up for a year,

118
00:06:46,121 --> 00:06:46,954
you can get a free domain name and if 
you use the offer code 

119
00:06:48,761 --> 00:06:49,594
nerdwriter@squarespace.com,
you can get 10 percent off your first 

120
00:06:51,941 --> 00:06:52,774
purchase,
which is cool if you want to make a 

121
00:06:53,831 --> 00:06:55,630
website.
Thank you guys so much.

122
00:06:55,631 --> 00:06:57,850
I'll see you next Wednesday.
