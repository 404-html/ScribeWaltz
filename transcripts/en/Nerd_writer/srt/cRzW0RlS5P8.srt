00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:02,993
Recently,
I was trying to decide whether or not I 

2
00:00:04,291 --> 00:00:05,124
should buy a wide angle lens for this 
camera and in order to make that 

3
00:00:08,071 --> 00:00:11,310
decision,
I employed the timeless technique of the

4
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:14,400
pros and cons list.
In the process of making that list,

5
00:00:14,401 --> 00:00:16,350
I happened to discover that the pros,
cons,

6
00:00:16,351 --> 00:00:17,184
lists,
technique,

7
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:22,080
something so simple that it had to be 
used by a human since time immemorial is

8
00:00:22,081 --> 00:00:22,914
actually a relatively recent invention 
by none other than our stupidly 

9
00:00:26,851 --> 00:00:30,180
accomplished forefather Benjamin 
Franklin to somewhat hilarious.

10
00:00:30,181 --> 00:00:32,850
Letter to Joseph priestly in 17,
72,

11
00:00:32,851 --> 00:00:33,684
Franklin explains it thusly.
My way is to divide half a sheet of 

12
00:00:37,171 --> 00:00:38,004
paper by a line into two columns,
writing over the one pro and over the 

13
00:00:41,011 --> 00:00:44,010
other con than during three or four days
consideration.

14
00:00:44,011 --> 00:00:45,720
I put down under different head shots,

15
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:46,663
hints of the different motives that at 
different times occur to me for or 

16
00:00:49,011 --> 00:00:51,260
against the law.
When I had that got them all together in

17
00:00:51,261 --> 00:00:52,094
one view,
I endeavored to estimate their 

18
00:00:52,701 --> 00:00:57,701
respective whites.
I'm going to act accordingly.

19
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:03,480
Now,
Franklin may merely

20
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,910
have been the first person to write this
idea down,

21
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,810
not the first to use it when it got me 
thinking about concepts that appeared to

22
00:01:09,811 --> 00:01:10,644
me as timeless,
but which only seemed so because I'm 

23
00:01:13,051 --> 00:01:16,980
trapped in this particular place at this
particular time.

24
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,390
For example,
the number zero,

25
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,400
we use it every day in conversation,
none,

26
00:01:20,401 --> 00:01:21,061
Nada,
Zip,

27
00:01:21,061 --> 00:01:22,350
Zilch,
zero goose egg,

28
00:01:22,351 --> 00:01:27,090
but as a concept zero took many 
centuries to develop and a number of our

29
00:01:27,091 --> 00:01:27,924
greatest minds to comprehend fully the 
best mathematicians of ancient Greece 

30
00:01:31,321 --> 00:01:34,890
didn't even have a name for zero.
It didn't like it does for us.

31
00:01:34,891 --> 00:01:38,310
Serve as a place holder for writing big 
numbers.

32
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,790
It wasn't until 6:50
add that Indian mathematician,

33
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:42,773
Brahma gooped finally formalized how to 
reach zero through addition and 

34
00:01:46,201 --> 00:01:47,034
subtraction that the concept took shape 
and it wasn't fully understood for 

35
00:01:50,131 --> 00:01:50,964
another thousand years when Newton and 
live nets invented calculus and what it 

36
00:01:54,421 --> 00:01:57,930
actually means to divide by zero from 
Matt.

37
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:58,763
Totally normal segue to sex,
though heterosexuality is something we 

38
00:02:01,531 --> 00:02:05,010
invoke to an almost ridiculous degree in
contemporary society.

39
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:05,933
The term actually dates to the mid 19th 
century and a letter written by 

40
00:02:08,731 --> 00:02:12,360
Austro-hungarian journalist Carl curt 
bent in the letter carrier,

41
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,233
Benny coins,
the terms for Hetero and homosexuality 

42
00:02:15,571 --> 00:02:19,500
as a way to suggest that there's no 
hierarchy between the two ways of life,

43
00:02:19,501 --> 00:02:22,950
that they're just different inborn 
expressions of sexuality.

44
00:02:22,951 --> 00:02:23,784
It wasn't until later in the 19th 
century that psychiatrists and 

45
00:02:26,101 --> 00:02:26,934
psychoanalysts established 
heterosexuality as a synonym for normal 

46
00:02:30,631 --> 00:02:33,420
and homosexuality is somehow deviant.
Before that,

47
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,710
people were persecuted for a certain 
sexual acts like sodomy or pedophilia.

48
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:42,600
The creation and coopting of these terms
enabled the persecution of orientation.

49
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,970
Okay.
What about the idea of ambition?

50
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,620
Surely a timeless concept for admirable 
striving up the social ladder.

51
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:54,390
Actually ambition is only as old as the 
social ladder is.

52
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,253
It wasn't until the Middle Ages that 
social mobility became a viable option 

53
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,513
for members of society before the 16th 
century social position was ordained by 

54
00:03:03,611 --> 00:03:06,220
God and classes were her medically 
sealed part.

55
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:09,130
Nobody not born there could get in or 
even entertain.

56
00:03:09,131 --> 00:03:12,700
The idea of doing so.
Ambition comes from the Latin and beer,

57
00:03:12,701 --> 00:03:17,701
which means to go around specifically to
go around canvassing for votes as in the

58
00:03:17,741 --> 00:03:19,540
old Roman system.
In ancient times,

59
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:24,630
it was always used as a negative term 
group together with pride and vainglory,

60
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,160
but when the middle ages ended and 
modernity,

61
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,023
dawn,
the English word ambition enters common 

62
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,263
usage as something positive to 
legitimize and reinforce the social 

63
00:03:35,351 --> 00:03:36,184
climbing of the new world.
Fast forward to today and it's 

64
00:03:38,171 --> 00:03:42,190
impossible to imagine office spaces 
without posters like this.

65
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,263
Finally childhood,
a timeless archetype of purity and 

66
00:03:46,661 --> 00:03:49,660
innocence known in the late 19th and 
20th century.

67
00:03:49,661 --> 00:03:50,494
Children were employed as laborers and 
their work was seen as crucial to 

68
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:55,390
contributing to the family income.

69
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,313
It was only after the passing of a 
number of child labor laws that 

70
00:03:58,781 --> 00:03:59,614
prohibited them from work that society 
began treating children in the way that 

71
00:04:02,711 --> 00:04:05,530
we think of now as explicitly 
noncommercial,

72
00:04:05,531 --> 00:04:09,190
as sacred,
imbued with an almost religious pure.

73
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:12,820
Instead of being individuals meant to 
secure the future for their parents.

74
00:04:12,821 --> 00:04:13,654
The roles were reversed and parents were
obliged to protect children from the 

75
00:04:16,931 --> 00:04:17,764
harsh realities of adult life and his 
children's ceased to be productive 

76
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:21,663
economic forces.
They reemerged in the economy as 

77
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:25,203
consumers and the sentimental space they
occupied was aggressively 

78
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:31,360
commercialized.
Before this shift in the culture,

79
00:04:31,361 --> 00:04:32,194
the concept of childhood was much less.
Hello to the point that even the death 

80
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:40,150
of a child was received with a certain 
amount of aloofness and detachment,

81
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,013
zealous or quotes,
a contemporary man on this subject to 

82
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:46,150
lose a child when first brought into 
life is very hard,

83
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:48,460
but it is a tax we must pay.

84
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:49,323
It's an attitude that's hard to imagine 
in a time like ours when the most 

85
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,673
horrific and emotionally painful event 
of recent memory was the death of 20 

86
00:04:57,671 --> 00:05:00,820
young children in Newtown,
Connecticut in 2012.

87
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:03,160
The majority of those who died today,
we're children,

88
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:09,070
a beautiful little kids between the ages
of five and 10 years old.

89
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:14,110
I'm not making a value judgment on any 
of these shifts in our culture.

90
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:14,973
For me,
it's extremely humbling to know that my 

91
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:20,980
conception of human nature is merely a 
reflection of a moment in history.

92
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:21,933
Many,
if not all of these things are 

93
00:05:23,081 --> 00:05:23,914
historical accidents,
not some great fulfillment of the way 

94
00:05:26,771 --> 00:05:31,771
humanity was always going to advance.
They express the wills of individuals in

95
00:05:31,871 --> 00:05:35,320
meshed in moralities as blind to the 
past as we are.

96
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,453
The more we understand that fact,
the more benevolent our own blind push 

97
00:05:40,121 --> 00:05:41,530
forward will be.

98
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,300
Thank you all for watching.
This is my friend Maya.

99

She's here to tell you that if you are 
interested in this topic,

100
00:05:46,931 --> 00:05:50,230
there's a couple of other videos I did 
in which I explored these topics.

101
00:05:50,231 --> 00:05:51,064
One on concept of love and one on the 
concept of logic and I'll put the links 

102
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:55,954
here that you can click on.
Maya really wants to tell you to

one.

105
00:06:04,341 --> 00:06:06,050
Sorry I've been absent for the last 
couple of weeks,

106
00:06:06,051 --> 00:06:08,150
but listen,
there's important things going on.

107

He's back.
I'm back next time.
