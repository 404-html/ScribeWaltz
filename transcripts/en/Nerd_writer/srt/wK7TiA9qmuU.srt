1
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:06,670
When you're smiling,
when you're smiling,

2
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:16,710
no.
Why did I do that?

3
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:24,080
When people evaluate great actors,
what often gets mentioned most is range,

4
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:26,390
how many different characters they can 
play,

5
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:30,260
how many different emotions they can 
realistically movingly show,

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,120
but I think a criteria and that's just 
as telling as range is depth.

7
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:39,050
How many different ways and actor can 
portray the same emotion.

8
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,393
I spent the last few weeks watching 
pretty much every film Jack Nicholson 

9
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,460
ever made and it's clear that the man 
can do it all,

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,020
but it's also no mistake.
That intensity is calling card today.

11
00:00:51,021 --> 00:00:51,854
I'd like to explore the ways that Jack 
Nicholson conveys and uses anger in his 

12
00:00:55,581 --> 00:00:56,414
work.
The angles he approaches it from the 

13
00:00:57,771 --> 00:00:58,604
spins and emphases he puts on it in 
order to see what makes Jack Nicholson 

14
00:01:01,521 --> 00:01:02,354
so great.
Anger is an emotional response or 

15
00:01:14,251 --> 00:01:17,790
reaction to something that reaction 
manifests psychologically,

16
00:01:17,791 --> 00:01:18,624
but also physically and everyone's had 
that sensation of being convulsed with 

17
00:01:22,831 --> 00:01:23,664
anger.
What Nicholson shows again and again in 

18
00:01:25,681 --> 00:01:29,940
his roles is how anger can literally 
possess the body like a spirit,

19
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,170
because I really want to know because it
was a mistake,

20
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:35,690
maybe we could do something about it.

21
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,770
This is the moment when anger becomes 
aggression.

22
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,113
Half the time that aggression in 
Nicholson's work is realized as actual 

23
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:44,463
violence against someone else,
whether it's psychotic violence or in 

24
00:01:47,771 --> 00:01:48,604
some way justify the other.
Half of the time this theatrical anger 

25
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,310
takes place in Nicholson's own personal 
space.

26
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,870
He flails around sometimes as a threat 
or a suggestion of violence to come.

27
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:06,490
A lot of the time it's just a release,
a discharge of pent up energy.

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,110
To me,
these moments,

29
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:08,973
the weird contortions and spasms that 
Nicholson makes are more poignant than 

30
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:13,773
actual attacks on people.
There are kind of exploration of the 

31
00:02:16,931 --> 00:02:21,931
relationship between body and mind and 
it never feels like overacting.

32
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:22,803
I think that's because these 
gesticulation are all unique to the 

33
00:02:26,171 --> 00:02:29,920
particular anger that they spring from.
Whether it's focused,

34
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:30,970
pointed,
anger,

35
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,580
or generally frustrated anger or 
petulant child.

36
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:42,320
We'll have to leave.
I'm not taking any more of your time,

37
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:45,693
Nicholson,

38
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:49,700
and everybody else for that matter.
Anger can be a form of desperation,

39
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:50,623
annoys so loud that you don't have to 
hear your own insecurities and Mike 

40
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:55,461
Nichols,
carnal knowledge.

41
00:02:55,461 --> 00:02:56,294
For example,
Nichols plays a playboy who objectifies 

42
00:02:58,251 --> 00:02:59,084
women and refuses to commit.
One of his lovers asks him to get 

43
00:03:01,661 --> 00:03:03,460
married and he explodes.

44
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,753
Fuck is my shoe,
or this place is a mess out half the 

45
00:03:08,131 --> 00:03:09,900
time you looked like it fell out of bed.

46
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:10,853
Nicholson acts a kind of anger here that
it's easy to see right through the 

47
00:03:14,101 --> 00:03:14,934
larger and louder it is.
The closer he is to recognizing a 

48
00:03:17,521 --> 00:03:18,860
vulnerability in himself.

49
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:21,790
Do you want an extra $50 a week?
Try back.

50
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,590
You mean you want an extra hundred 
dollars?

51
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:28,630
Make this Goddamn goddamn window.
That's why he can stand up in here,

52
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,670
the God damn place.

53
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:34,850
That's the challenge for an actor 
playing this emotion.

54
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,450
You're not just playing anger,
you're playing what's under it.

55
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,493
Most anger isn't psychotic.
It's only a thin veneer for what's 

56
00:03:42,471 --> 00:03:43,304
brewing below and you have to be able to
turn up the volume while preserving 

57
00:03:46,641 --> 00:03:48,710
traces.
Of this deeper motivation,

58
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,740
that's what Nicholson excels at in the 
border.

59
00:03:51,741 --> 00:03:52,574
For example,
Nicholson plays a border agent who gets 

60
00:03:54,141 --> 00:03:56,840
caught up with his partner is human 
smuggling operation.

61
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,150
When the partner starts killing his 
competition,

62
00:03:59,151 --> 00:03:59,984
Nicholson realizes that he's gotten into
far the key emotion in this exchange is 

63
00:04:03,971 --> 00:04:05,720
an anger,
but fear,

64
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:06,763
fear of what he's gotten himself into,
fear that he won't be able to get 

65
00:04:08,991 --> 00:04:12,080
himself out on Nicholson bursts with 
anger here,

66
00:04:12,081 --> 00:04:15,500
but it's in the silent moments where the
actual feelings

67
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,710
like,
I don't care about your fucking money.

68
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,950
Fucking life is going to be fine before 
I ever get involved murder.

69
00:04:20,951 --> 00:04:22,270
You understand what I'm saying to you?

70
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,360
This is why you Nicholson's characters 
seem real in their anger.

71
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,430
Even with great writing and great 
direction.

72
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:30,503
It's only the actor who can make a 
character polyphonic like more than one 

73
00:04:33,421 --> 00:04:36,480
thing is happening at the same time,
and even when you do that,

74
00:04:36,481 --> 00:04:37,314
that particular expression of anger has 
to rise out of the particular 

75
00:04:39,781 --> 00:04:41,880
character's personality.
For example,

76
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:42,714
take these two examples of anger which 
are both underlaid with a strong sense 

77
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,830
of superiority.
Can't handle the truth.

78
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,193
Son,
we live in a world that has walls and 

79
00:04:53,371 --> 00:04:55,800
those walls have to be guarded by men 
with guns.

80
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:58,170
Who's gonna do it you,
you,

81
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,360
Lieutenant Weinberg,
never,

82
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:03,540
never interrupt me.
Okay?

83
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:07,890
Not if there's a fire.
Not even if you hear the sound of a thud

84
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:11,220
from my home in one week later,
there's a smell coming from there.

85
00:05:11,221 --> 00:05:12,054
There can only be a decaying human body 
and you have to hold Hanky to your face 

86
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,870
because the stench is so thick that you 
think you're going to faint.

87
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:20,003
Both of these men feel smarter and more 
important than the person they're 

88
00:05:22,711 --> 00:05:23,544
lecturing too,
but the first is a lifelong military 

89
00:05:26,071 --> 00:05:27,510
man.
In a court of law,

90
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:32,550
Nicholson barely moves his body or head.
Every swivel of the neck is measured and

91
00:05:32,551 --> 00:05:33,384
exact.
You so restrained that a simple lean 

92
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:37,260
forward feels like he's lost it.

93
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:40,420
I did the job,
God damn right,

94
00:05:40,421 --> 00:05:41,254
I did.

95
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:44,760
The second man is smug and in his own 
space,

96
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:47,070
his movements are freer,
looser,

97
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,500
and they even seemed to mock great 
kinnear's,

98
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:53,400
homosexuality.
Don't know not on this,

99
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:59,930
not for any reason you get me,
sweetheart.

100
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,100
No two expressions of anger are the 
same,

101
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,530
not in real life and not in Nicholson's 
work.

102
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:08,930
Sometimes his anger,
his comedic,

103
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:12,590
sometimes cartoonish.
Sometimes it's quiet,

104
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:17,420
sometimes it's misplaced and sometimes 
it's deeply,

105
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:21,290
deeply wounded.
Whatever you're doing stuff,

106
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,690
whatever you're doing,
stop it.

107
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:32,550
I hope you die.
I hope you fucking die.

108
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,953
Watching so much of Nicholson's acting,
you start to get a sense of the larger 

109
00:06:38,081 --> 00:06:41,380
shape of anger as a human phenomenon.
It's extremes,

110
00:06:41,381 --> 00:06:42,214
its physicality and it's dangerous,
but also its necessity in the course of 

111
00:06:46,571 --> 00:06:49,240
a life.
None of us can avoid anger.

112
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:52,660
You can't remove it from the 
constellation of feelings,

113
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:53,853
but you can't understand it.
Jack Nicholson has a wide range of 

114
00:06:57,101 --> 00:07:00,580
talents as wider range as an actor,
as anybody else,

115
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:06,300
and yet if all he ever did was give us 
these 60 years of insights into anger,

116
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:10,600
it would still be a career well spent.

117
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,440
Hey everybody.
Thanks for watching.

118
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,590
That was a lot of Jack Nicholson movies 
to see,

119
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:24,550
but it was totally worth it.
You learn a lot by watching a master at.

120
00:07:24,551 --> 00:07:27,860
Thanks for watching that and thank you 
to the great courses plus for sponsoring

121
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,570
this video.
If you don't know what it is,

122
00:07:29,571 --> 00:07:31,760
the great courses plus is an on demand 
video.

123
00:07:31,761 --> 00:07:35,300
Learning service basically means it's 
got over 70,000

124
00:07:35,301 --> 00:07:36,134
online video lecture series from some 
Great Ivy League professors and other 

125
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:44,270
professors about all kinds of subjects,
math and history and archeology,

126
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:45,163
but one that I think meshes with what we
were just talking about with acting is 

127
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,650
this course by Daniel Robinson called 
the great ideas in psychology,

128
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,870
sort of which go all along the history 
of psychology to,

129
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,290
to overview what's been talked about and
discover it.

130
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:00,650
And,
and that's sort of my wheelhouse.

131
00:08:00,651 --> 00:08:02,660
So I love to learn that kind of stuff.
Check that out.

132
00:08:02,661 --> 00:08:05,760

the description down there.

135
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:14,090
Um,
after that it's 1490 $9 a month.

136
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:16,190
I think it's really cool.
If you like learning,

137
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,920
I think you'd really love it.
Thanks guys for watching.

138
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,400
I will see the rest of you next 
Wednesday.
