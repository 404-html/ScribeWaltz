1
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:14,673
Okay,
so there's a reason why it's not 

2
00:00:15,671 --> 00:00:20,671
uncommon for audio files to use steely 
Dan records to test the sound quality of

3
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:22,263
new speakers.
The band is among the most sonically 

4
00:00:24,851 --> 00:00:27,700
sophisticated pop acts of the 20th and 
21st century,

5
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:28,563
not just an audio fidelity,
but in the complexity of their jazz and 

6
00:00:31,811 --> 00:00:32,644
blues influenced songs.
Today I want to break down one of my 

7
00:00:35,711 --> 00:00:37,780
favorite steely Dan Songs,
Deacon Blues,

8
00:00:37,781 --> 00:00:38,614
to show you what goes into making one of
these things and we might as well back 

9
00:00:42,671 --> 00:00:45,160
up and start at the intro,
which I'll play again,

10
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:00,143
so that is one of the most recognizable 
intros and steely Dan's whole 

11
00:01:02,821 --> 00:01:03,654
discography because it features a unique
kind of court that's become a defining 

12
00:01:07,441 --> 00:01:11,280
feature of their music.
It's called the MIU major court.

13
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,173
They called it that,
a specific chord voicing that swaps a 

14
00:01:14,551 --> 00:01:17,670
second degree note for a tonic note in a
major chord.

15
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,460
For example,
if you take the c major chord,

16
00:01:20,461 --> 00:01:21,191
c,
g,

17
00:01:21,191 --> 00:01:22,024
C,
e,

18
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,390
and you switched the second c for a d 
note,

19
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:29,580
you've made a c major chord and you can 
hear a moon majors all throughout steely

20
00:01:29,581 --> 00:01:32,460
dance music like in the first chorus of 
black cow,

21
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,633
the chorus of don't take me alive even 
right here in their first album on fire 

22
00:01:44,761 --> 00:01:45,594
in the hole,
and it should be noted that even though 

23
00:01:49,741 --> 00:01:50,574
steely Dan squeezed the miu major for 
all it's worth this voicing has a 

24
00:01:53,371 --> 00:01:56,070
history that goes all the way back to 
the twelfth century.

25
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,270
The first time it was ever used was 
imperative.

26
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:00,320
The greats,
bitterroot ness.

27
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:04,200
Take a listen to the beautiful second 
syllable of ness right here.

28
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:13,430
After these quintessential expressions 
of the [inaudible] major chord,

29
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:17,990
the song dives into the first verse and 
we begin to hear the story of a suburban

30
00:02:17,991 --> 00:02:21,590
man in crisis.
Fantasizing about becoming an alcoholic.

31
00:02:21,591 --> 00:02:26,591
Saxophone player.
Instrumentation includes a Rhodes piano,

32
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,930
a base that sort of floats along,
carrying the rhythm.

33
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,960
Larry Carlton steadily holding the 
Melody on Guitar,

34
00:02:35,961 --> 00:02:36,794
adding small frills which are hardly 
noticeable but extremely important and 

35
00:02:40,341 --> 00:02:44,030
that they keep you from getting bored 
with the progression while complimenting

36
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:44,893
vegans focus.
You have an acoustic guitar in there 

37
00:02:48,471 --> 00:02:50,990
too,
and the Great Bernard Purdie,

38
00:02:50,991 --> 00:02:53,780
one of the best grooved drummers of all 
time.

39
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:56,810
It's ordered.

40
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,020
Call me up

41
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:11,240
if you listen to Deacon Blues on 
headphones or speakers,

42
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,520
and here just how good this music 
sounds.

43
00:03:13,521 --> 00:03:18,260
Every instrument has its own life.
Each sound is thick and close up when it

44
00:03:18,261 --> 00:03:19,094
needs to be to achieve this Vegan and 
Becker at were explicit and following 

45
00:03:21,921 --> 00:03:26,150
the example of legendary jazz producer 
and engineer Rudy Van Gelder,

46
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:30,050
whose work at blue note records defined 
a generation of jazz music.

47
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,990
Then Gilda was notoriously secretive 
about his techniques,

48
00:03:32,991 --> 00:03:33,824
but it's known that he had musicians 
played very close to the microphones to 

49
00:03:36,711 --> 00:03:38,870
make his instruments sound warm and 
intimate.

50
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,493
Anyone who's used microphones like the 
one I'm recording this narration on 

51
00:03:49,411 --> 00:03:50,244
right now,
knows that every microphone has a 

52
00:03:51,991 --> 00:03:54,600
different quality of sound.
Steely Dan's producer,

53
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:55,434
Roger Nicole,
described his extensive microphone 

54
00:03:56,971 --> 00:03:57,804
collection in an interview once,
and the point is that the band 

55
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:00,773
experimented exhaustively to get just 
the right sound for each instrument and 

56
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:05,244
vocal.
You can hear right there that when we 

57
00:04:12,231 --> 00:04:15,260
enter the second verse of Deacon Blues,
a horn section comes in,

58
00:04:15,261 --> 00:04:16,094
composed by Tom Scott,
who detailed in a Washington Post 

59
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:19,424
interview,
how he modeled his horns after Oliver 

60
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:22,383
Nelson's or Kestrel style in which 
middle register horns slide against one 

61
00:04:25,611 --> 00:04:27,950
another to create a thicker dissonant 
sound.

62
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:39,540
Vegan insisted Scott include nothing in 
the high end,

63
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,613
and for this reason,
when the bridge comes and the saxophone 

64
00:04:42,571 --> 00:04:43,404
solo happens,
personifying the main character of the 

65
00:04:45,241 --> 00:04:48,000
song.
It cuts through the mix like a lightning

66
00:04:48,001 --> 00:04:53,001
bolt.
Because of the saxophone.

67
00:04:54,821 --> 00:04:57,100
Solo is such an important part of the 
song.

68
00:04:57,101 --> 00:05:00,370
Fagan and Becker searched for the right 
player to embody the sound.

69
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:03,880
One night they turned on the tonight 
show with Johnny Carson.

70
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,350
Saw this

71
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:10,163
pete,
Chris lead to work your saxophone and 

72
00:05:13,141 --> 00:05:18,141
play what I feel very scotch whiskey all
night long guy behind the wheel.

73
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,920
And I thought you were talking about my 
life.

74
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:27,750
So it was easy.
I just had to take one tape.

75
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:37,410
Instrumentation on Deacon Boone

76
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,513
is immaculate and complex,
but I think the lyrics are just as 

77
00:05:41,721 --> 00:05:42,554
important.
Deacon Blues tells the story of a 

78
00:05:44,631 --> 00:05:47,990
midlife crisis,
a man living a safe life in suburbia,

79
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,033
looking through the glass said gamblers 
and wild ramblers seeing romance in the 

80
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,080
million lights of the city at night.
He wants to be a saxophonist,

81
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:58,250
drink scotch whiskey,
die behind the wheels.

82
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:01,610
Deacon Blues is a song of existential 
desire,

83
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,230
a desire,
as Becker says,

84
00:06:03,231 --> 00:06:04,064
for one of those mythic forms of loser,
dumb and opposite to the routine middle 

85
00:06:08,571 --> 00:06:13,571
register existence that stretches life 
to a thin film of small significance.

86
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:17,420
Fagan and Becker have always been 
sardonic and Rye songwriters,

87
00:06:17,421 --> 00:06:20,180
they're smooth,
jazzy feel stands in direct,

88
00:06:20,181 --> 00:06:21,014
almost mocking opposition to the punk 
rock sound that was gaining popularity 

89
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:25,634
at the same time,
there's always a detachment in their 

90
00:06:27,741 --> 00:06:31,880
songs and uncertainty about exactly who 
they're making fun of.

91
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,223
For example,
they came up with the name of the Song 

92
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,013
Deacon Blues by recognizing how 
ridiculous it was to give sports teams 

93
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:42,440
majestic nicknames like University of 
Alabama's crimson tide.

94
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,860
This mocking tone has turned a lot of 
people off to their music,

95
00:06:45,861 --> 00:06:46,694
but Deacon Blues I think contains a 
hidden earnestness in the lead into the 

96
00:06:50,421 --> 00:06:51,254
first chorus.
The narrator says he's ready to cross 

97
00:06:52,911 --> 00:06:53,744
that fine line.
The line between his existence and the 

98
00:06:56,001 --> 00:06:59,180
one he wants to have.
The song suggests that he's tried before

99
00:06:59,181 --> 00:07:00,014
and failed,
but the music place these lines like 

100
00:07:01,491 --> 00:07:02,324
he's taking a running headstart 
barreling toward a chorus that explodes 

101
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:07,670
into the fantasy.

102
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:15,390
I'm ready to die.
For this reason,

103
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,520
I think you can look at Deacon Blues as 
a kind of literature.

104
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:38,683
The story seems to be the central 
component here with each element of the 

105
00:07:41,121 --> 00:07:41,954
music,
filling out nuances and the main 

106
00:07:43,641 --> 00:07:44,474
character is fantasy to the point where 
it's unclear in the last verse whether 

107
00:07:47,451 --> 00:07:51,320
the narrator has actually done it or 
it's just been caught up in the dream.

108
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:02,670
I think listening to steely Dan with 
some good headphones,

109
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:03,783
rewards close reads like this.
The layers are all there for you to 

110
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:10,960
examine one by one or simply enjoy in 
their combined expression.

111
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:12,303
The quality is great.
The composition is complex and the 

112
00:08:15,191 --> 00:08:16,024
lyrics are interesting and dense for me.
All of that adds up to a song that is 

113
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:21,334
going to last.

114
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,700
Hey everybody.
Thanks for watching.

115
00:08:41,701 --> 00:08:42,534
I love steely Dan and I love this 
because I've never analyzed a song 

116
00:08:45,571 --> 00:08:46,404
before and I love trying new things.
Special thanks to the Washington Post 

117
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:52,650
and to Howard writes,
work on the moon,

118
00:08:52,651 --> 00:08:57,480
major chord and steely Dan such stuff 
there from both those guys.

119
00:08:57,481 --> 00:08:59,430
I linked them below.
Want to give him a special thanks.

120
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,770
I want to tell you guys about a channel 
that I really love.

121
00:09:01,771 --> 00:09:03,570
It's called wisecracker.
You can see it right there.

122
00:09:03,571 --> 00:09:04,404
They do video essays like me and we've 
been pushing to each other because I 

123
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:09,060
think if you like my stuff,
you're definitely gonna like there's.

124
00:09:09,061 --> 00:09:10,170
They do thug notes,
earthlink,

125
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:11,610
son,
and an eight bit philosophy.

126
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,790
There's really great funny work,
so click over there.

127
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:16,730
Watch one subscribed.
I know you guys are gonna.

128
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:17,583
Love it.
I have to catch a plane right now to 

129
00:09:19,771 --> 00:09:22,800
Pennsylvania because I'm about to give 
my first ted talk.

130
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:27,060
Excited and nervous and I'll see you 
guys on the other side.
