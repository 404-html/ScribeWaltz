<v Speaker 1>Why is David fincher?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In my head,</v>

2
00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.140
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about this a lot while </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching his new netflix series,</v>

3
00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:09.003
<v Speaker 1>mind hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd watch an episode or to go to the </v>

4
00:00:11.441 --> 00:00:14.050
<v Speaker 1>kitchen to get a drink and everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>would look.</v>

5
00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:14.943
<v Speaker 1>Fincher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ask like my eyes were mimicking his </v>

6
00:00:16.901 --> 00:00:19.630
<v Speaker 1>camera movement somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First I was creeped out,</v>

7
00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.460
<v Speaker 1>then I was impressed and then it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>curious what about his filmmaking causes</v>

8
00:00:24.461 --> 00:00:25.294
<v Speaker 1>this effect because there are plenty of </v>
<v Speaker 1>other amazing stylistic directors whose </v>

9
00:00:28.451 --> 00:00:31.930
<v Speaker 1>visual styles don't hijack your census </v>
<v Speaker 1>like venture does,</v>

10
00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.330
<v Speaker 1>and it's the same with all his movies </v>
<v Speaker 1>and TV shows.</v>

11
00:00:34.331 --> 00:00:35.164
<v Speaker 1>I checked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went back through all of them to see </v>

12
00:00:36.581 --> 00:00:40.960
<v Speaker 1>if I could locate the source of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>quality and I think I found it here.</v>

13
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.170
<v Speaker 1>Did you see that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very small thing and it's easy to</v>

14
00:00:49.171 --> 00:00:51.510
<v Speaker 1>miss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the more I watched fincher's work,</v>

15
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.320
<v Speaker 1>the more it stands out as a key element </v>
<v Speaker 1>of his visual language.</v>

16
00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.120
<v Speaker 1>What is it exactly?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

17
00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.580
<v Speaker 1>it's a camera move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this case,</v>

18
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.350
<v Speaker 1>the tilt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this case,</v>

19
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.200
<v Speaker 1>a pan in this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a tracking shot,</v>

20
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:05.453
<v Speaker 1>and in this case all three these things </v>
<v Speaker 1>are the most common tools and the </v>

21
00:01:09.121 --> 00:01:09.954
<v Speaker 1>filmmakers toolbox.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can find them in pretty much any </v>

22
00:01:11.491 --> 00:01:12.324
<v Speaker 1>film you watch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but fincher has a very specific way of </v>

23
00:01:15.031 --> 00:01:19.170
<v Speaker 1>using them which falls in line with his </v>
<v Speaker 1>reputation as a perfectionist.</v>

24
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:20.063
<v Speaker 1>Essentially what he tries to do is have </v>
<v Speaker 1>the camera exactly match the velocity </v>

25
00:01:23.851 --> 00:01:26.100
<v Speaker 1>and direction of the moving character in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the frame.</v>

26
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.670
<v Speaker 1>When the character stops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the camera stops and starts again.</v>

27
00:01:29.671 --> 00:01:30.504
<v Speaker 1>When the person starts to move again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the matching movement here isn't </v>

28
00:01:32.821 --> 00:01:33.720
<v Speaker 1>just clothes.</v>

29
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.730
<v Speaker 1>It's perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so perfect.</v>

30
00:01:35.731 --> 00:01:36.564
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it must involve some kind of time </v>

31
00:01:37.801 --> 00:01:38.634
<v Speaker 1>to rehearsal with the actors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I learned when I tried to do it </v>

32
00:01:41.191 --> 00:01:42.024
<v Speaker 1>myself earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is no doubt a part of the reason </v>

33
00:01:43.801 --> 00:01:46.440
<v Speaker 1>why fincher is known for doing so many </v>
<v Speaker 1>takes.</v>

34
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.513
<v Speaker 1>It takes patience and a good camera </v>
<v Speaker 1>operator to get these moves exactly </v>

35
00:01:50.131 --> 00:01:51.720
<v Speaker 1>right and they're happening all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

36
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.540
<v Speaker 1>everywhere in little shots in between </v>
<v Speaker 1>shots,</v>

37
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.403
<v Speaker 1>shots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You notice in shots you don't and </v>

38
00:01:56.941 --> 00:01:57.774
<v Speaker 1>whether they register or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the effect starts to accumulate in your </v>

39
00:02:00.511 --> 00:02:01.344
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden fincher's reality is </v>

40
00:02:03.511 --> 00:02:04.500
<v Speaker 1>your reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

41
00:02:04.501 --> 00:02:05.334
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a very good reason why </v>
<v Speaker 1>this happens and it's a bit </v>

42
00:02:07.561 --> 00:02:08.394
<v Speaker 1>counterintuitive when you consider that </v>
<v Speaker 1>fincher's camera work is often regarded </v>

43
00:02:11.311 --> 00:02:15.690
<v Speaker 1>as impersonal or coldly omniscient even </v>
<v Speaker 1>by fincher himself,</v>

44
00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:16.683
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's somewhat disingenuous</v>
<v Speaker 1>because what these shots do is </v>

45
00:02:19.861 --> 00:02:23.700
<v Speaker 1>effectively lock you in to the behavior </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the characters.</v>

46
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.780
<v Speaker 1>You really feel it when someone moves </v>
<v Speaker 1>around the space that they're in.</v>

47
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.830
<v Speaker 1>Even small gestures like a shrug or </v>
<v Speaker 1>deflated shoulders.</v>

48
00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.850
<v Speaker 1>Even the slightest change in posture is </v>
<v Speaker 1>registered by this camera.</v>

49
00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.893
<v Speaker 1>In this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think pinterest cinematography is a </v>

50
00:02:38.101 --> 00:02:40.710
<v Speaker 1>lot more personal than even he makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

51
00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.560
<v Speaker 1>It might happen just below the level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness,</v>

52
00:02:43.561 --> 00:02:47.490
<v Speaker 1>but a much more in sync with this </v>
<v Speaker 1>character than I am with,</v>

53
00:02:47.491 --> 00:02:49.020
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this character.</v>

54
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.033
<v Speaker 1>It's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fincher's actors have to move in these </v>

55
00:02:51.451 --> 00:02:55.980
<v Speaker 1>very deliberate lines at steady speed's </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably ironed out by rehearsal,</v>

56
00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.720
<v Speaker 1>but the result,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least for me,</v>

57
00:02:57.721 --> 00:03:02.410
<v Speaker 1>is a greater connection to the character</v>
<v Speaker 1>than something that is more free form.</v>

58
00:03:02.411 --> 00:03:04.000
<v Speaker 1>Less exact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

59
00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:06.940
<v Speaker 1>it's no surprise that fincher would pay </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention to details like this.</v>

60
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.983
<v Speaker 1>Listen to the advice he gave Robin </v>
<v Speaker 1>Wright when she directed her first </v>

61
00:03:10.211 --> 00:03:11.590
<v Speaker 1>episode of House of cards.</v>

62
00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.110
<v Speaker 2>Every scene you direct,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every scene you act in,</v>

63
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:17.870
<v Speaker 2>it's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's that?</v>

64
00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.870
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior over time,</v>

65
00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:22.663
<v Speaker 2>it's a fraction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So behavior is the most important thing </v>

66
00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.030
<v Speaker 2>of every piece of material that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>read,</v>

67
00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.650
<v Speaker 2>that you performance and you direct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at the behavior,</v>

68
00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.230
<v Speaker 1>David.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fincher is obsessed with behavior.</v>

69
00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.820
<v Speaker 1>He knows that the way a person moves is </v>
<v Speaker 1>a key part of who they are and what they</v>

70
00:03:40.821 --> 00:03:43.100
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knows that if a person is running and</v>

71
00:03:43.101 --> 00:03:43.934
<v Speaker 1>the camera follows that running exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's like the audience is running </v>

72
00:03:47.031 --> 00:03:49.910
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knows that the truth of aspiration is</v>

73
00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.400
<v Speaker 1>in the speed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone lurches forward.</v>

74
00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:53.263
<v Speaker 1>He knows that fear can express itself in</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly how slow someone stands up or </v>

75
00:03:57.861 --> 00:04:00.440
<v Speaker 1>that when a person floats back in </v>
<v Speaker 1>astonishment,</v>

76
00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:01.573
<v Speaker 1>the camera should follow up with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a coincidence that emotion has </v>

77
00:04:04.821 --> 00:04:08.690
<v Speaker 1>the word emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Emotions express themselves physically.</v>

78
00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:11.650
<v Speaker 1>What fincher does is put his camera in </v>
<v Speaker 1>lock,</v>

79
00:04:11.651 --> 00:04:14.630
<v Speaker 1>step with the body to capture that </v>
<v Speaker 1>physicality,</v>

80
00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:15.763
<v Speaker 1>and as a result,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we developed this almost unconscious </v>

81
00:04:17.841 --> 00:04:22.220
<v Speaker 1>connection with these characters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the trick works almost too well.</v>

82
00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.430
<v Speaker 1>You start to notice behavior and </v>
<v Speaker 1>movement in the real world,</v>

83
00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.210
<v Speaker 1>but in the way that fincher stages then </v>
<v Speaker 1>deliberate,</v>

84
00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:30.223
<v Speaker 1>steady and precise for a little while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least David fincher hijacks your </v>

85
00:04:35.301 --> 00:04:36.134
<v Speaker 1>eyes.</v>

86
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:40.613

<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
