1
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.670
<v Speaker 1>What's the scariest painting and Art </v>
<v Speaker 1>History?</v>

2
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:26.753
<v Speaker 1>There are some strong contenders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the judgment of Kumbaya by Gerard </v>

3
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.133
<v Speaker 1>divvied Hieronymus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bosch is rendering the Henry Fuselli </v>

4
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.633
<v Speaker 1>nightmare edvard moocs screen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's only ever really been one </v>

5
00:00:41.821 --> 00:00:44.640
<v Speaker 1>painting that has seriously disturbed </v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

6
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.630
<v Speaker 1>This one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Francisco Goya's,</v>

7
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.520
<v Speaker 1>Saturn devouring his son.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you're seeing here is the legendary</v>

8
00:00:53.521 --> 00:00:57.000
<v Speaker 1>Spanish painters depiction of the Greek </v>
<v Speaker 1>Titan cronus,</v>

9
00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.193
<v Speaker 1>who after usurping power from his father</v>
<v Speaker 1>was told a prophecy that one of his own </v>

10
00:01:02.371 --> 00:01:03.204
<v Speaker 1>sons would do the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you serve him in order to prevent </v>

11
00:01:06.211 --> 00:01:08.850
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time his Queen Raya bore a child,</v>

12
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.200
<v Speaker 1>kronis would eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately for him in the end,</v>

13
00:01:13.201 --> 00:01:16.080
<v Speaker 1>ray conspired to hide away their </v>
<v Speaker 1>youngest son,</v>

14
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.930
<v Speaker 1>Zeus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who eventually fulfilled the prophecy,</v>

15
00:01:18.931 --> 00:01:22.170
<v Speaker 1>exiled his father and ended the reign of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the titans.</v>

16
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.940
<v Speaker 1>The story is a well known Greek myth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but look at how Goya handles it.</v>

17
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.460
<v Speaker 1>Some key changes jump out right away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>

18
00:01:29.461 --> 00:01:30.294
<v Speaker 1>in the myth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cronus devours his children by </v>

19
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.960
<v Speaker 1>swallowing them whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

20
00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.823
<v Speaker 1>they remain alive in his stomach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Goya's painting is a much more gruesome </v>

21
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:39.803
<v Speaker 1>affair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He takes some inspiration here from </v>

22
00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:42.623
<v Speaker 1>Peter Paul Rubens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a flemish baroque painter who depicted </v>

23
00:01:44.821 --> 00:01:47.430
<v Speaker 1>the same event as well in Rubin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saturn.</v>

24
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.293
<v Speaker 1>The tightened seems to be sucking the </v>
<v Speaker 1>life force from his child even for such </v>

25
00:01:51.991 --> 00:01:56.310
<v Speaker 1>a terrifying subject matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ruben's displays all the drama richness,</v>

26
00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.550
<v Speaker 1>even beauty that marks the baroque </v>
<v Speaker 1>style.</v>

27
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:00.810
<v Speaker 1>He helped to make famous</v>

28
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.180
<v Speaker 1>in Goias version.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That beauty is gone.</v>

29
00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.130
<v Speaker 1>We're left with a frightened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazed monster discovered in the dark as</v>

30
00:02:10.131 --> 00:02:13.760
<v Speaker 1>if by some explorer with a torch who </v>
<v Speaker 1>wandered into the wrong cave.</v>

31
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.953
<v Speaker 1>Saturn kronis his Roman name as already </v>
<v Speaker 1>chewed off the head of his child is </v>

32
00:02:19.641 --> 00:02:23.090
<v Speaker 1>black mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>opens around the elbow of the left arm,</v>

33
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.180
<v Speaker 1>ready to bite it off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the joint is angular.</v>

34
00:02:26.181 --> 00:02:28.580
<v Speaker 1>Body is crouching in an awkward </v>
<v Speaker 1>position.</v>

35
00:02:28.581 --> 00:02:33.581
<v Speaker 1>His hands dig into the spine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blood runs down his child's arm and neck</v>

36
00:02:34.881 --> 00:02:37.490
<v Speaker 1>and shoulder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a startling primary color,</v>

37
00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:38.773
<v Speaker 1>and if we take a closer look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we notice that this is not a child at </v>

38
00:02:41.991 --> 00:02:44.840
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of Saturn's kids grown up.</v>

39
00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:50.300
<v Speaker 1>There's something even more terrifying </v>
<v Speaker 1>in knowing that the victim knew what was</v>

40
00:02:50.301 --> 00:02:54.530
<v Speaker 1>happening and tried to fight back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what's most disturbing of all,</v>

41
00:02:54.531 --> 00:02:59.531
<v Speaker 1>I think is when and where this painting </v>
<v Speaker 1>was found late in his life.</v>

42
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.633
<v Speaker 1>Francisco Goya purchased a house on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>outskirts of Madrid called the Quinta </v>

43
00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:05.783
<v Speaker 1>Dale Sordo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the villa of the deaf after its </v>

44
00:03:07.331 --> 00:03:08.164
<v Speaker 1>previous owner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and interesting coincidence since by </v>

45
00:03:10.001 --> 00:03:13.930
<v Speaker 1>that time in his life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Goya was deaf to his physical and mental</v>

46
00:03:13.931 --> 00:03:14.890
<v Speaker 1>health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>declining.</v>

47
00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:15.753
<v Speaker 1>Goya painted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>14 murals often refer to as the black </v>

48
00:03:19.481 --> 00:03:23.260
<v Speaker 1>paintings directly onto the interior </v>
<v Speaker 1>walls of his home.</v>

49
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.410
<v Speaker 1>Saturn devouring his son was in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dining room.</v>

50
00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.280
<v Speaker 1>The photographs you're seeing now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're taking over 50 years.</v>

51
00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.143
<v Speaker 1>After that time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Goya never mentioned the paintings </v>

52
00:03:33.791 --> 00:03:34.624
<v Speaker 1>himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He never intended for anyone to see </v>

53
00:03:36.851 --> 00:03:37.870
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To this day,</v>

54
00:03:37.871 --> 00:03:40.810
<v Speaker 1>people still puzzle over the meaning of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the black paintings.</v>

55
00:03:40.811 --> 00:03:41.644
<v Speaker 1>Why was Goya creating these pessimistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>and fantastical scenes in the solitude </v>

56
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:47.103
<v Speaker 1>of his home to understand this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might help to go back through his </v>

57
00:03:50.501 --> 00:03:52.630
<v Speaker 1>career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He grew up in Zara,</v>

58
00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:53.650
<v Speaker 1>Goza,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spain,</v>

59
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.680
<v Speaker 1>the fourth of six children in a lower </v>
<v Speaker 1>middle class family.</v>

60
00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:57.813
<v Speaker 1>By all accounts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a lighthearted and joyful kid as </v>

61
00:04:00.311 --> 00:04:02.500
<v Speaker 1>he studied painting in Zara,</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes up,</v>

62
00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:03.363
<v Speaker 1>Madrid and Rome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His first serious job was at the royal </v>

63
00:04:06.101 --> 00:04:06.934
<v Speaker 1>tapestry factory where he created </v>
<v Speaker 1>tapestry cartoons to adorn the palaces </v>

64
00:04:10.511 --> 00:04:14.560
<v Speaker 1>and stately homes of the city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These tapestries take their cue from the</v>

65
00:04:14.561 --> 00:04:16.480
<v Speaker 1>Rococo style,</v>
<v Speaker 1>elegant,</v>

66
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:17.433
<v Speaker 1>playful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>light scenes of both nobility and </v>

67
00:04:19.751 --> 00:04:20.584
<v Speaker 1>peasantry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enjoying the normal activities of their </v>

68
00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.690
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Goya eventually became the court painter</v>

69
00:04:25.691 --> 00:04:29.260
<v Speaker 1>for King Charles the fourth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a disappointing monarch,</v>

70
00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:30.183
<v Speaker 1>unlike his father Charles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the third who was beloved by the people </v>

71
00:04:32.951 --> 00:04:37.951
<v Speaker 1>for enacting reforms that began to bring</v>
<v Speaker 1>secular enlightenment values to Spain in</v>

72
00:04:38.681 --> 00:04:40.480
<v Speaker 1>1793 and unknown</v>

73
00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:41.993
<v Speaker 2>left Goya,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yet though he still took emissions from </v>

74
00:04:44.351 --> 00:04:47.590
<v Speaker 2>his royal clientele.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This disease was a dark time</v>

75
00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:48.513
<v Speaker 1>turning point in his life and art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see it in yard with lunatics </v>

76
00:04:52.061 --> 00:04:56.500
<v Speaker 1>from 1794.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bodies Grapple and cry out in anguish.</v>

77
00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.210
<v Speaker 1>The difference between this and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tapestry cartoons is shocking.</v>

78
00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.020
<v Speaker 1>His hearing gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Goya began to see the country around him</v>

79
00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.913
<v Speaker 1>with a grim clarity and a series of </v>
<v Speaker 1>etchings called Los Capriccio or the </v>

80
00:05:10.061 --> 00:05:10.894
<v Speaker 1>caprices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He sends up a Spanish culture that is </v>

81
00:05:12.821 --> 00:05:16.780
<v Speaker 1>both tragic and comic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a student of the enlightenment himself.</v>

82
00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.380
<v Speaker 1>Goya sees the country backsliding on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>road to maternity.</v>

83
00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.550
<v Speaker 1>The king is withdrawn and the people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>superstitious,</v>

84
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:25.533
<v Speaker 1>too stupid to know what they need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see him fusing all the corners </v>

85
00:05:29.171 --> 00:05:32.080
<v Speaker 1>of his imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the quest for anatomical truth,</v>

86
00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:37.170
<v Speaker 1>the need for social critique and an </v>
<v Speaker 1>obsession with beasts and creatures.</v>

87
00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.390
<v Speaker 1>It's all summed up in this one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aptly titled,</v>

88
00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.950
<v Speaker 1>the sleep of reason produces monsters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the following years,</v>

89
00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:47.020
<v Speaker 1>things got worse for Spain.</v>

90
00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:47.883
<v Speaker 1>Napoleon invaded the country and </v>
<v Speaker 1>brutally massacred those who resisted </v>

91
00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:52.323
<v Speaker 1>his campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Goya was witnessed to the bloodshed and </v>

92
00:05:54.851 --> 00:05:57.590
<v Speaker 1>it affected him deeply.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His painting on the subject,</v>

93
00:05:57.591 --> 00:05:58.730
<v Speaker 1>the third of May 18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

94
00:05:58.731 --> 00:06:03.731
<v Speaker 1>eight is a regulatory depiction of war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>resistance and brutality.</v>

95
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.950
<v Speaker 1>Before this war was a highly composed </v>
<v Speaker 1>theatrical subject.</v>

96
00:06:07.951 --> 00:06:12.200
<v Speaker 1>In painting here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Goya gives nothing but brute force.</v>

97
00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:13.423
<v Speaker 1>It's emotion unmediated by artifice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be five years until Spain </v>

98
00:06:17.661 --> 00:06:19.670
<v Speaker 1>regained its thrown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the interim,</v>

99
00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:22.090
<v Speaker 1>resistors developed the constitution of </v>
<v Speaker 1>18,</v>

100
00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:22.953
<v Speaker 1>12,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which called for liberal reforms like </v>

101
00:06:24.771 --> 00:06:25.604
<v Speaker 1>national sovereignty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom of the press and free </v>

102
00:06:27.681 --> 00:06:30.230
<v Speaker 1>enterprise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but on gaining power.</v>

103
00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:31.093
<v Speaker 1>The new King Ferdinand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the seventh squash the constitution </v>

104
00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:37.600
<v Speaker 1>right away and arrested those who made </v>
<v Speaker 1>it Goya,</v>

105
00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:38.873
<v Speaker 1>withdrew disheartened the country which </v>
<v Speaker 1>in his youth had reached toward a new </v>

106
00:06:42.831 --> 00:06:46.790
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was now swallowed again by autocracy,</v>

107
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.540
<v Speaker 1>scarred by war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scarred by illness.</v>

108
00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:54.080
<v Speaker 1>He began to paint nightmare scenes onto </v>
<v Speaker 1>the walls of his home.</v>

109
00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:55.813
<v Speaker 1>In one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a young man is being eaten by the </v>

110
00:06:58.521 --> 00:07:00.410
<v Speaker 1>father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was prophesied to you.</v>

111
00:07:00.411 --> 00:07:04.640
<v Speaker 1>Serve by now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Goya knows progress isn't assured,</v>

112
00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:07.490
<v Speaker 1>and when it's defeated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not painless,</v>

113
00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:12.110
<v Speaker 1>it's horrific and slow and the victim </v>
<v Speaker 1>can feel it happening.</v>

114
00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:15.890
<v Speaker 1>There are a lot of ways that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>read Saturn devouring his son.</v>

115
00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:17.263
<v Speaker 1>Maybe Goya was trying to exercise the </v>
<v Speaker 1>demons of his mind or the demons of his </v>

116
00:07:21.411 --> 00:07:22.244
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>
