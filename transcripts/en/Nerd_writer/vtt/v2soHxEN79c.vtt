1
00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:04.950
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's clear something up.</v>

2
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:06.083
<v Speaker 1>The enemy ghost in the shell from 1995 </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the live action ghost in the shell </v>

3
00:00:09.781 --> 00:00:12.810
<v Speaker 1>from earlier this year are not the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>

4
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.360
<v Speaker 1>They're both adopted from the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe,</v>

5
00:00:15.361 --> 00:00:18.570
<v Speaker 1>originally created in the Manga by have </v>
<v Speaker 1>mooney sheer route,</v>

6
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.090
<v Speaker 1>but they pulled from different parts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that universe.</v>

7
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.103
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the popularity of the 1995 animated </v>

8
00:00:24.751 --> 00:00:25.584
<v Speaker 1>features seems to have convinced someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it was a good idea to graft images </v>

9
00:00:29.551 --> 00:00:33.780
<v Speaker 1>and sequences from that movie onto a </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely different story.</v>

10
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.430
<v Speaker 1>Don't get me wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like images as much as the next guy,</v>

11
00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:47.260
<v Speaker 1>but the ones in ghost in the shell 2017 </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't really do it any favors.</v>

12
00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:48.303
<v Speaker 1>The evocative colors in sharp contrast </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the anime are replaced by drab dark </v>

13
00:00:52.721 --> 00:00:53.554
<v Speaker 1>talents that are often hard to make out </v>
<v Speaker 1>that sure animation is more likely to </v>

14
00:00:56.381 --> 00:01:00.070
<v Speaker 1>have crispr lines of contrast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the live action movie not only fails</v>

15
00:01:00.071 --> 00:01:02.260
<v Speaker 1>to recreate the beauty of its </v>
<v Speaker 1>predecessor,</v>

16
00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.660
<v Speaker 1>it fails to understand the purpose of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

17
00:01:04.661 --> 00:01:08.950
<v Speaker 1>But take a look at these two shots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does each make you feel?</v>

18
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.120
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>

19
00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.350
<v Speaker 1>the one on the left draws my attention </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the bed.</v>

20
00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.770
<v Speaker 1>It's the brightest part of an otherwise </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty uniformly colored frank.</v>

21
00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:17.703
<v Speaker 1>If you blurt it out like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see that there is virtually no </v>

22
00:01:19.541 --> 00:01:20.374
<v Speaker 1>contrast between the interior walls of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the apartment and the cityscape through </v>

23
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:24.633
<v Speaker 1>the window.</v>

24
00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:25.503
<v Speaker 1>It makes for a blend bluish composition </v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't ask you for any further </v>

25
00:01:28.331 --> 00:01:30.190
<v Speaker 1>consideration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or what about this one?</v>

26
00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:31.203
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the immediately recognizable difference </v>

27
00:01:32.361 --> 00:01:34.860
<v Speaker 1>is the light source.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead of coming from the bed,</v>

28
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:35.733
<v Speaker 1>the light comes from the window and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>blown out so much that it creates this </v>

29
00:01:38.681 --> 00:01:42.940
<v Speaker 1>frame within a frame effect that trout </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the apartment and leaves the major in</v>

30
00:01:42.941 --> 00:01:45.190
<v Speaker 1>Silhouette.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's great contrast here,</v>

31
00:01:45.191 --> 00:01:47.590
<v Speaker 1>but the purpose of the contrast is more </v>
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>

32
00:01:47.591 --> 00:01:51.190
<v Speaker 1>It's almost as if the major shape is cut</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of the city itself.</v>

33
00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:52.203
<v Speaker 1>In a video I made a couple of years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spoke about how the 1995 anamae </v>

34
00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.190
<v Speaker 1>explores the relationship between city </v>
<v Speaker 1>and person.</v>

35
00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.730
<v Speaker 1>It uses a futuristic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pluralistic,</v>

36
00:02:00.731 --> 00:02:01.564
<v Speaker 1>dynamic Hong Kong to interrogate what it</v>
<v Speaker 1>means to build a personal identity in </v>

37
00:02:05.591 --> 00:02:06.424
<v Speaker 1>the age of sidewalks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does this by visually framing </v>

38
00:02:08.471 --> 00:02:09.304
<v Speaker 1>characters in relation to the city </v>
<v Speaker 1>around them and by giving us time to </v>

39
00:02:11.831 --> 00:02:14.770
<v Speaker 1>contemplate the space where the story </v>
<v Speaker 1>takes place,</v>

40
00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:15.813
<v Speaker 1>most notably in a three and a half </v>
<v Speaker 1>minute meditative sequence that allows </v>

41
00:02:18.161 --> 00:02:20.080
<v Speaker 1>us to simply look at the city.</v>

42
00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.010
<v Speaker 1>It's funny that the live action movie </v>
<v Speaker 1>ads 20 more minutes of runtime,</v>

43
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.220
<v Speaker 1>but can't find any time for something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like this.</v>

44
00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.220
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for all the cool visuals that boasts,</v>

45
00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.770
<v Speaker 1>there is really no city at all in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>

46
00:02:32.771 --> 00:02:33.604
<v Speaker 1>Just a digital canvas to show off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cyber punkish affects the way ghost in </v>

47
00:02:37.781 --> 00:02:40.030
<v Speaker 1>the shell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty 17 one says to see the city is in</v>

48
00:02:40.031 --> 00:02:40.864
<v Speaker 1>these elaborate soaring shots that move </v>
<v Speaker 1>and glide through the holographic </v>

49
00:02:44.861 --> 00:02:45.694
<v Speaker 1>buildings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but actual people don't see the city </v>

50
00:02:48.191 --> 00:02:51.070
<v Speaker 1>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that 2017 helped me to</v>

51
00:02:51.071 --> 00:02:51.904
<v Speaker 1>realize is that every shot in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>montage from the anime is from the </v>

52
00:02:55.151 --> 00:02:55.984
<v Speaker 1>perspective of human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The camera is placed only where could </v>

53
00:02:59.651 --> 00:03:02.950
<v Speaker 1>actually stand or sit or gaze out of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>window.</v>

54
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.550
<v Speaker 1>That's how you build a sense of place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not like this.</v>

55
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.190
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can learn a lot about what makes the</v>

56
00:03:09.191 --> 00:03:12.520
<v Speaker 1>anime so great by watching the live </v>
<v Speaker 1>action ghost in the shell.</v>

57
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.890
<v Speaker 1>Let's take a look at this sequence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

58
00:03:14.891 --> 00:03:19.030
<v Speaker 1>one of my favorite from the original </v>
<v Speaker 1>story of the garbage man in the enemy.</v>

59
00:03:19.031 --> 00:03:19.864
<v Speaker 1>We get to spend three or four minutes </v>
<v Speaker 1>with this guy and his coworker as they </v>

60
00:03:22.871 --> 00:03:23.704
<v Speaker 1>work and chat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He explains that his estranged wife </v>

61
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:26.283
<v Speaker 1>won't let him see his daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he's hacking into her mind to find </v>

62
00:03:28.961 --> 00:03:31.720
<v Speaker 1>out why she's doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He even chose this colleague,</v>

63
00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.250
<v Speaker 1>a picture of his daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

64
00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.490
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't really care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's my beautiful,</v>

65
00:03:35.491 --> 00:03:38.210
<v Speaker 2>precious angel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See gannaway.</v>

66
00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm not interested in crap like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the 2017 version we get this.</v>

67
00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.190
<v Speaker 2>You want me to pay for violin too?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't get me.</v>

68
00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.070
<v Speaker 2>I love that 50 patients I do because </v>
<v Speaker 2>she's amazing,</v>

69
00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.460
<v Speaker 2>but when she practices the thing is </v>
<v Speaker 2>painful,</v>

70
00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:56.550
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why not piano?</v>

71
00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:58.053
<v Speaker 1>That was 14 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't see these guys doing their </v>

72
00:04:00.431 --> 00:04:02.050
<v Speaker 1>job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't get any conversation.</v>

73
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.153
<v Speaker 1>In 14 seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their minds are hacked and they become </v>

74
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.760
<v Speaker 1>zombies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After this,</v>

75
00:04:06.761 --> 00:04:07.594
<v Speaker 1>they staged the iconic fight scene from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the enemy in the water in front of the </v>

76
00:04:10.571 --> 00:04:11.404
<v Speaker 1>city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's virtually a shot for shot remake </v>

77
00:04:13.151 --> 00:04:13.984
<v Speaker 1>with a few differences like these </v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful science versus these beige </v>

78
00:04:18.251 --> 00:04:19.084
<v Speaker 1>buildings or this red shirt as a point </v>
<v Speaker 1>of focus versus this beige overcoat or </v>

79
00:04:23.951 --> 00:04:28.150
<v Speaker 1>even this little smile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a man momentarily in awe of his city.</v>

80
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.610
<v Speaker 1>A brief moment like that can add so </v>
<v Speaker 1>much,</v>

81
00:04:30.611 --> 00:04:33.910
<v Speaker 1>but ghost in the shell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 17 never has time for them.</v>

82
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.133
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we get to the tragic moment when the </v>

83
00:04:36.251 --> 00:04:38.770
<v Speaker 1>garbage man learns that he's been </v>
<v Speaker 1>fooled,</v>

84
00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.760
<v Speaker 1>that all his memories of his daughter or</v>
<v Speaker 1>fake implanted by a hacker.</v>

85
00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.330
<v Speaker 1>The live action version shoots this in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird glass box with a man.</v>

86
00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.720
<v Speaker 1>We've spent 14 seconds with cutting all </v>
<v Speaker 1>over the place.</v>

87
00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.170
<v Speaker 1>The enemy takes this moment largely in </v>
<v Speaker 1>one shot,</v>

88
00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:56.740
<v Speaker 1>garbage man in the harsh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>overexposed light of the truth.</v>

89
00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.750
<v Speaker 1>The man doesn't believe it with a cop </v>
<v Speaker 1>brings out the man's photograph and asks</v>

90
00:05:01.751 --> 00:05:04.330
<v Speaker 1>him what he sees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a picture of her.</v>

91
00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.980
<v Speaker 1>She was there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was smiling like an angel.</v>

92
00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:10.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry to put you through this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

93
00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:17.250
<v Speaker 1>Come on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who do you see in the Nma?</v>

94
00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:18.123
<v Speaker 1>We get this tragic little arc,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one that echos the larger themes of the </v>

95
00:05:21.161 --> 00:05:24.130
<v Speaker 1>film and it's sequenced brilliantly </v>
<v Speaker 1>following.</v>

96
00:05:24.131 --> 00:05:24.964
<v Speaker 1>This is the scuba diving scene where </v>
<v Speaker 1>major ruminates on her own identity and </v>

97
00:05:28.571 --> 00:05:29.404
<v Speaker 1>following that is the montage I </v>
<v Speaker 1>mentioned before where we get to </v>

98
00:05:31.991 --> 00:05:32.824
<v Speaker 1>ruminate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the ideas from both scenes </v>

99
00:05:34.151 --> 00:05:37.180
<v Speaker 1>compound and reverberate across the </v>
<v Speaker 1>city.</v>

100
00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:40.120
<v Speaker 1>In the live action movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the character is a throwaway.</v>

101
00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:41.920
<v Speaker 1>The scene is disconnected.</v>

102
00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.360
<v Speaker 1>The scuba diving seen as isolated as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well elsewhere in the movie at any time.</v>

103
00:05:46.361 --> 00:05:49.060
<v Speaker 1>For us to dwell on these ideas is </v>
<v Speaker 1>nonexistent.</v>

104
00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:50.583
<v Speaker 1>The worst part about it is that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>story ghost in the shell 2017 once to </v>

105
00:05:53.471 --> 00:05:57.350
<v Speaker 1>tell is actually really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's from a part of the TV series,</v>

106
00:05:57.351 --> 00:05:58.184
<v Speaker 1>the standalone complex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it features the Revolutionary Qusay </v>

107
00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:02.143
<v Speaker 1>here played by Michael Pitt whose </v>
<v Speaker 1>backstory is tragic and whose ideology </v>

108
00:06:06.351 --> 00:06:07.184
<v Speaker 1>is profound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't get to explore any of that </v>

109
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:14.120
<v Speaker 1>because 2017 is busy trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>accommodate two stories.</v>

110
00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.040
<v Speaker 1>There were interesting things about </v>
<v Speaker 1>both,</v>

111
00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:17.113
<v Speaker 1>but we get nothing but the surface level</v>
<v Speaker 1>of either those who adapt works of art </v>

112
00:06:22.251 --> 00:06:25.790
<v Speaker 1>should be given the creative license to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make the story work for them,</v>

113
00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.110
<v Speaker 1>but you can't just mind the source </v>
<v Speaker 1>material for parts,</v>

114
00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:31.453
<v Speaker 1>adaptations and remakes,</v>
