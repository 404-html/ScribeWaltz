1
00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:02.063
<v Speaker 1>In movies or TV,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever one character says to another </v>

2
00:00:05.311 --> 00:00:06.144
<v Speaker 1>character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't we just go back to the way things </v>

3
00:00:09.901 --> 00:00:10.734
<v Speaker 1>used to be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's usually a sign on the part of the </v>

4
00:00:12.721 --> 00:00:13.554
<v Speaker 1>writers that that character has yet to </v>
<v Speaker 1>face up either to reality or to </v>

5
00:00:17.281 --> 00:00:20.010
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The cliche is offered up as a solution.</v>

6
00:00:20.011 --> 00:00:20.844
<v Speaker 1>Some trauma has passed parties that were</v>
<v Speaker 1>enraged or hurt or a mistaken one to </v>

7
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:26.693
<v Speaker 1>forgive or heal or apologize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want the bad times to give way to </v>

8
00:00:31.681 --> 00:00:34.410
<v Speaker 1>good times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but only on the pretense,</v>

9
00:00:34.411 --> 00:00:37.650
<v Speaker 1>the false pretense that the bad times </v>
<v Speaker 1>never happened.</v>

10
00:00:37.651 --> 00:00:40.170
<v Speaker 1>This is a kind of red herring of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reconciliation.</v>

11
00:00:40.171 --> 00:00:44.430
<v Speaker 1>We know that trauma can be repressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it can't be erased.</v>

12
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.330
<v Speaker 1>Lasting reconciliation is achieved by </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional self awareness,</v>

13
00:00:48.331 --> 00:00:49.164
<v Speaker 1>by embracing the change agents of trauma</v>
<v Speaker 1>and how they irreversibly reorganize </v>

14
00:00:53.641 --> 00:00:57.330
<v Speaker 1>elements of personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>identity and social reality.</v>

15
00:00:57.331 --> 00:01:00.420
<v Speaker 1>This idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of embracing our wounds,</v>

16
00:01:00.421 --> 00:01:01.254
<v Speaker 1>our brokenness is manifested quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>politically in the Japanese mending </v>

17
00:01:05.341 --> 00:01:09.630
<v Speaker 1>practice of consumer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally meaning golden joinery.</v>

18
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.463
<v Speaker 1>Consume.</v>
<v Speaker 1>D is the art of fixing broken pottery </v>

19
00:01:12.451 --> 00:01:13.550
<v Speaker 1>with lacquer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>resin,</v>

20
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:14.573
<v Speaker 1>dusted or mixed with powder goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Asian cultures have a long history in </v>

21
00:01:19.291 --> 00:01:20.124
<v Speaker 1>lacquer ware,</v>
<v Speaker 1>though it matured into a sophisticated </v>

22
00:01:21.841 --> 00:01:26.841
<v Speaker 1>art in the Chinese Shang Dynasty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The earliest discovered lacquered object</v>

23
00:01:27.151 --> 00:01:31.860
<v Speaker 1>dates to the Neolithic Himoutu culture </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the fifth millennium,</v>

24
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.690
<v Speaker 1>BC older than the earth itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>According to young Earth creationists,</v>

25
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.520
<v Speaker 1>pretty impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be alien,</v>

26
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.280
<v Speaker 1>the various delicate arts of lacquer </v>
<v Speaker 1>ware,</v>

27
00:01:41.281 --> 00:01:45.090
<v Speaker 1>ramified and expanded down millenniums </v>
<v Speaker 1>and cultures.</v>

28
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.983
<v Speaker 1>The story of consumer reportedly begins </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the 15th century with the Japanese </v>

29
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.293
<v Speaker 1>military commander.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The story goes that famous Shogun </v>

30
00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.601
<v Speaker 1>Ashikaga,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yoshi.</v>

31
00:01:54.601 --> 00:01:58.740
<v Speaker 1>Masa broke one of his prize Chinese tea </v>
<v Speaker 1>bowls,</v>

32
00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.190
<v Speaker 1>so he sent the item back to China for </v>
<v Speaker 1>repair.</v>

33
00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.460
<v Speaker 1>What he got in return was his bowl </v>
<v Speaker 1>mended with bulky and ugly metal staples</v>

34
00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.941
<v Speaker 1>dismayed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yoshi,</v>

35
00:02:08.941 --> 00:02:09.774
<v Speaker 1>Masa prompted Japanese craftsmen to </v>
<v Speaker 1>search for a more aesthetic means of </v>

36
00:02:14.071 --> 00:02:14.550
<v Speaker 1>repair.</v>

37
00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:15.383
<v Speaker 1>The Art of keen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Suki became famous for turning broken </v>

38
00:02:17.881 --> 00:02:21.960
<v Speaker 1>objects into pieces more beautiful than </v>
<v Speaker 1>the original product.</v>

39
00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.820
<v Speaker 1>There are even rumors of people breaking</v>
<v Speaker 1>their own possessions on purpose so that</v>

40
00:02:26.821 --> 00:02:29.580
<v Speaker 1>they can be mended using this lovely </v>
<v Speaker 1>technique.</v>

41
00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.190
<v Speaker 1>The philosophy here follows from abroad </v>
<v Speaker 1>or Japanese aesthetic called Wabi,</v>

42
00:02:35.191 --> 00:02:36.024
<v Speaker 1>Sabi that finds beauty not in </v>
<v Speaker 1>traditional western ideals of symmetry </v>

43
00:02:39.271 --> 00:02:40.104
<v Speaker 1>or geometry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in Buddhist concept of impermanence </v>

44
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.290
<v Speaker 1>and imperfection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fracture is on a ceramic bowl.</v>

45
00:02:46.291 --> 00:02:48.900
<v Speaker 1>Don't represent the end of that object's</v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

46
00:02:48.901 --> 00:02:51.990
<v Speaker 1>but rather an essential moment in its </v>
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>

47
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.440
<v Speaker 1>The flaws of a shape aren't hidden from </v>
<v Speaker 1>inspection,</v>

48
00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:56.543
<v Speaker 1>but in blaze with golden significance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe Hemingway had consumed pee on his </v>

49
00:03:01.721 --> 00:03:05.890
<v Speaker 1>mind when he wrote that famous line from</v>
<v Speaker 1>a farewell to arms.</v>

50
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.950
<v Speaker 1>The world breaks everyone and afterward </v>
<v Speaker 1>many are strong in the broken places.</v>

51
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.903
<v Speaker 1>The amazing art of consuming a fading </v>
<v Speaker 1>art like so many handcrafts symbolizes </v>

52
00:03:17.111 --> 00:03:21.490
<v Speaker 1>the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That repair requires transformation.</v>

53
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.930
<v Speaker 1>That pristine is less beautiful than the</v>
<v Speaker 1>broke,</v>

54
00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:27.243
<v Speaker 1>and that the shape of us is impossible </v>
<v Speaker 1>to see until it's fractured until the </v>

55
00:03:31.631 --> 00:03:34.540
<v Speaker 1>wound,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a crack runs.</v>

56
00:03:34.541 --> 00:03:35.374
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

57
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.160
<v Speaker 1>hey everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thanks for watching.</v>

58
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.023
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] is just another example of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the profound differences in western and </v>

59
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.873
<v Speaker 1>eastern aesthetics and thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not too much to read about it </v>

60
00:03:54.941 --> 00:03:57.100
<v Speaker 1>online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but every article that I found,</v>
