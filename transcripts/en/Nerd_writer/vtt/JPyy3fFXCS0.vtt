00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:06.590
<v Speaker 1>Copy on a Tuesday and blog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>14 crosswalk buttons.</v>

2
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.060
<v Speaker 1>What do they work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So contrary to popular belief,</v>

3
00:00:20.061 --> 00:00:20.894
<v Speaker 1>people do walk in Los Angeles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I come across the crosswalk button </v>

4
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.710
<v Speaker 1>almost everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It usually goes like this.</v>

5
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:26.540
<v Speaker 1>I hit the button,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing happens.</v>

6
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.060
<v Speaker 1>Then I hit it repeatedly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing happens.</v>

7
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.770
<v Speaker 1>Then I hold it down as if to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>

8
00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.700
<v Speaker 1>Then something happens and I feel like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

9
00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:41.283
<v Speaker 1>I realize I probably just contracted </v>
<v Speaker 1>leprosy because I've been talking that </v>

10
00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.770
<v Speaker 1>filthy buttons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's the deal?</v>

11
00:00:44.771 --> 00:00:45.604
<v Speaker 1>Is it all in my head or am I really most</v>
<v Speaker 1>at this article from the New York Times </v>

12
00:00:48.281 --> 00:00:49.114
<v Speaker 1>in 2004 years?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well worn push buttons have offered </v>

13
00:00:51.221 --> 00:00:54.730
<v Speaker 1>harried walkers are rare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Promise of control over their pedestrian</v>

14
00:00:54.731 --> 00:00:55.780
<v Speaker 1>lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

15
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.873
<v Speaker 1>you Michael Lewis</v>

16
00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.900
<v Speaker 2>studied journalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mass is probably the right adjective.</v>

17
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm making fun of Novelis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It turns out the city,</v>

18
00:01:06.481 --> 00:01:08.490
<v Speaker 1>the activated most of it's pedestrian </v>
<v Speaker 1>buttons longer ago,</v>

19
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.770
<v Speaker 1>more than 2,500</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the 3,250.</v>

20
00:01:10.771 --> 00:01:11.604
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Buttons that now exist function </v>

21
00:01:12.211 --> 00:01:15.360
<v Speaker 1>essentially as mechanical placebos your </v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanical placebo,</v>

22
00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.940
<v Speaker 1>but it's true with the advent of </v>
<v Speaker 1>computer controlled traffic signals.</v>

23
00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.970
<v Speaker 1>Crossword buttons have largely been </v>
<v Speaker 1>deactivated.</v>

24
00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:20.813
<v Speaker 1>Major cities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Traffic is controlled by a centralized </v>

25
00:01:21.781 --> 00:01:22.614
<v Speaker 1>computers executing complex timing pet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's how seth green can help Mark </v>

26
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.590
<v Speaker 1>Wahlberg get places in his mini coop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the article is about New York.</v>

27
00:01:28.591 --> 00:01:30.110
<v Speaker 1>What about Los Angeles?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So is it,</v>

28
00:01:30.111 --> 00:01:32.490
<v Speaker 1>is it true that there are certain parts </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the day in which</v>

29
00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:33.910
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

30
00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.510
<v Speaker 1>the buttons won't affect</v>

31
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.393
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

32
00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:39.970
<v Speaker 1>the light because of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the,</v>

33
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.990
<v Speaker 1>because of the complex pattern</v>

34
00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:43.123
<v Speaker 4>that I have not heard directly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I could imagine that that would be </v>

35
00:01:46.161 --> 00:01:46.994
<v Speaker 4>the case where there might be certain </v>
<v Speaker 4>person the day where it's gonna turn </v>

36
00:01:50.661 --> 00:01:54.950
<v Speaker 4>green on its own timing regardless of </v>
<v Speaker 4>whether somebody has thought about it or</v>

37
00:01:54.951 --> 00:01:56.120
<v Speaker 4>not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because you know,</v>

38
00:01:56.121 --> 00:01:59.220
<v Speaker 4>say if it's rush hour,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they want to get the cars brew.</v>

39
00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.390
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So placebos were everywhere,</v>

40
00:02:01.391 --> 00:02:04.890
<v Speaker 1>yet still we press well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the short answer is humans love.</v>

41
00:02:04.891 --> 00:02:06.660
<v Speaker 1>But we've been conditioned all our </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives.</v>

42
00:02:06.661 --> 00:02:09.010
<v Speaker 1>I believe that buttons do things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you should just do it.</v>

43
00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:11.763
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

44
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.333
<v Speaker 1>it's at crosswalks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We see ourselves pushing the button and </v>

45
00:02:16.231 --> 00:02:18.710
<v Speaker 1>then we see the little white man cause </v>
<v Speaker 1>and effect.</v>

46
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:19.553
<v Speaker 1>Who cares what's happening in between.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We hit the stimulus and get the reward </v>

47
00:02:21.961 --> 00:02:22.794
<v Speaker 1>that we want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His tendency is called the illusion of </v>

48
00:02:24.481 --> 00:02:25.314
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an idea first developed in 1975 by </v>

49
00:02:26.791 --> 00:02:27.624
<v Speaker 1>ellen langer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A professor of psychology at Harvard </v>

50
00:02:29.011 --> 00:02:31.470
<v Speaker 1>says that we overestimate our ability to</v>
<v Speaker 1>control events.</v>

51
00:02:31.471 --> 00:02:33.360
<v Speaker 1>Here's one example in casinos at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>craps table.</v>

52
00:02:33.361 --> 00:02:36.660
<v Speaker 1>It's been shown that people roll harder </v>
<v Speaker 1>when they want to get higher numbers and</v>

53
00:02:36.661 --> 00:02:38.130
<v Speaker 1>software when they want to get lower </v>
<v Speaker 1>numbers,</v>

54
00:02:38.131 --> 00:02:42.120
<v Speaker 1>even though dice rolling you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you're George Clooney is a chance</v>

55
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.350
<v Speaker 1>event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Suzanne Thompson,</v>

56
00:02:43.351 --> 00:02:44.184
<v Speaker 1>professor of Psychology Pomona college </v>
<v Speaker 1>says that the illusion of control is </v>

57
00:02:46.501 --> 00:02:47.334
<v Speaker 1>determined by a control your risk </v>
<v Speaker 1>puristic as an experienced based common </v>

58
00:02:50.371 --> 00:02:51.204
<v Speaker 1>sense method of problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The control heuristic is based on two </v>

59
00:02:53.671 --> 00:02:54.504
<v Speaker 1>conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the intention to create the outcome and </v>

60
00:02:55.291 --> 00:02:57.200
<v Speaker 1>the relationship between the outcome and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the action.</v>

61
00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.300
<v Speaker 1>When I pressed the crosswalk button,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to chant.</v>

62
00:02:59.301 --> 00:03:00.134
<v Speaker 1>It does change eventually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's according to the control here </v>

63
00:03:01.511 --> 00:03:03.400
<v Speaker 1>ristick my illusion of control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His strength.</v>

64
00:03:03.401 --> 00:03:04.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm more likely to press it again in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>

65
00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.020
<v Speaker 1>Is this good or bad for me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to decide that for yourself,</v>

66
00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:09.820
<v Speaker 1>consider this even with higher illusions</v>
<v Speaker 1>of control,</v>

67
00:03:09.821 --> 00:03:13.840
<v Speaker 1>are more likely to try new things and </v>
<v Speaker 1>subsequently do new things in those with</v>

68
00:03:13.841 --> 00:03:16.840
<v Speaker 1>lower loop people who are depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>show lower illusions of control and it's</v>

69
00:03:16.841 --> 00:03:19.510
<v Speaker 1>not hard to see why when you consider </v>
<v Speaker 1>their self worth,</v>

70
00:03:19.511 --> 00:03:20.344
<v Speaker 1>but it has also been shown that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>with higher illusions of control are </v>

71
00:03:22.301 --> 00:03:25.030
<v Speaker 1>more likely to commit to failing courses</v>
<v Speaker 1>of action.</v>

72
00:03:25.031 --> 00:03:25.864
<v Speaker 1>It has been argued that a lack of </v>
<v Speaker 1>illusions is associated with a </v>

73
00:03:27.341 --> 00:03:28.174
<v Speaker 1>non-defensive personality oriented </v>
<v Speaker 1>toward growth and understanding with a </v>

74
00:03:31.961 --> 00:03:34.150
<v Speaker 1>low ego involvement in outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

75
00:03:34.151 --> 00:03:35.500
<v Speaker 1>I think this point is really important.</v>

76
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.350
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me say that we are Westerners in the</v>

77
00:03:38.351 --> 00:03:40.990
<v Speaker 1>tradition of a western philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means that we are doers,</v>

78
00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.580
<v Speaker 1>actors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>believers in the will,</v>

79
00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:43.443
<v Speaker 1>that it can create and change things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm proud of that tradition and growing </v>

80
00:03:45.821 --> 00:03:46.654
<v Speaker 1>up in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that I can never totally be a </v>

81
00:03:47.621 --> 00:03:50.290
<v Speaker 1>part of eastern philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the opposite.</v>

82
00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.970
<v Speaker 1>Though I believe that there are things </v>
<v Speaker 1>we can change.</v>

83
00:03:51.971 --> 00:03:53.820
<v Speaker 1>I also believe that there are things we </v>
<v Speaker 1>can.</v>

84
00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:54.693
<v Speaker 1>One thing we can't change is people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe that seems like an obvious </v>

85
00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:58.203
<v Speaker 1>factor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think sometimes we want it so </v>

86
00:03:59.711 --> 00:04:02.920
<v Speaker 1>badly that we have the illusion that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in our control,</v>

87
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.903
<v Speaker 1>so maybe your short,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 100 percent positive that someone </v>

88
00:04:05.951 --> 00:04:08.290
<v Speaker 1>you know is going about something wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

89
00:04:08.291 --> 00:04:11.830
<v Speaker 1>it takes a non-defensive personality to </v>
<v Speaker 1>see that it would be wrong to try to get</v>

90
00:04:11.831 --> 00:04:14.290
<v Speaker 1>them to do it right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It may be a little bit counterintuitive,</v>

91
00:04:14.291 --> 00:04:15.940
<v Speaker 1>but telling someone what's right for </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

92
00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.360
<v Speaker 1>thinking that you know what's right for </v>
<v Speaker 1>them is a way of exercising control,</v>

93
00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.130
<v Speaker 1>failed to imagine one another </v>
<v Speaker 1>complexity,</v>

94
00:04:21.131 --> 00:04:21.964
<v Speaker 1>and in our simplistic view that we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>handle another's problems better than </v>

95
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.580
<v Speaker 1>even thinking it's an illusion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd be better off.</v>

96
00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:29.293
<v Speaker 2>Friend dependent will never fully know </v>
<v Speaker 2>until you let go of the illusion of </v>

97
00:04:36.571 --> 00:04:37.404
<v Speaker 2>control.</v>

98
00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The is the best animated movie.</v>

99
00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:01.363
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
