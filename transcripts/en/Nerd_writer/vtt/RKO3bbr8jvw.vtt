1
00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:03.750
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have 20 minutes to five.</v>

2
00:00:03.751 --> 00:00:08.751
<v Speaker 1>We can now say the decision taken in </v>
<v Speaker 1>1975 by this country to join.</v>

3
00:00:08.941 --> 00:00:13.941
<v Speaker 1>The common market has been reversed by </v>
<v Speaker 1>this referendum to leave the EU.</v>

4
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.430
<v Speaker 2>You know whether you think brexit is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>good or a bad idea at this point.</v>

5
00:00:19.431 --> 00:00:20.264
<v Speaker 2>One thing is beyond doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an idea whose time has come to the </v>

6
00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.610
<v Speaker 2>independent United Kingdom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This isn't something that just happened.</v>

7
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:31.753
<v Speaker 2>What the world witness last Friday was </v>
<v Speaker 2>the culmination of a pressure movement </v>

8
00:00:34.341 --> 00:00:35.174
<v Speaker 2>that started over 20 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a movement that has evolved and evolved </v>

9
00:00:38.871 --> 00:00:39.704
<v Speaker 2>across the years and bite it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's time exploiting every national and </v>

10
00:00:42.711 --> 00:00:45.480
<v Speaker 2>political crisis to achieve its end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

11
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.403
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>choosing a starting point for this is a </v>

12
00:00:47.901 --> 00:00:48.734
<v Speaker 2>bit arbitrary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There have been so called euroskeptic </v>

13
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:51.613
<v Speaker 2>since 1973 when the UK first joined,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was then called the European </v>

14
00:00:54.891 --> 00:00:57.260
<v Speaker 2>community,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if I had to pick a date,</v>

15
00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.920
<v Speaker 2>I might pick September 20th,</v>
<v Speaker 2>1988.</v>

16
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.360
<v Speaker 2>When Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher </v>
<v Speaker 2>gave a famous speech in Bruge,</v>

17
00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:06.283
<v Speaker 2>laying out a number of the ideas that </v>
<v Speaker 2>would influence euro skepticism for </v>

18
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.310
<v Speaker 2>years to come.</v>

19
00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.310
<v Speaker 3>We have not successfully rolled back the</v>
<v Speaker 3>frontiers of the state in Britain own to</v>

20
00:01:15.611 --> 00:01:16.444
<v Speaker 3>see them reimposed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so tiotropium level with the European </v>

21
00:01:19.881 --> 00:01:23.390
<v Speaker 3>superstate exercising or new dominance </v>
<v Speaker 3>from Brussels.</v>

22
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.280
<v Speaker 2>The result of the speech with something </v>
<v Speaker 2>called the Bruce Group,</v>

23
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.293
<v Speaker 2>a conservative think tank that promoted </v>
<v Speaker 2>rolling back the [inaudible] trend </v>

24
00:01:29.851 --> 00:01:31.800
<v Speaker 2>towards centralization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember,</v>

25
00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:32.663
<v Speaker 2>this was at the end of the Soviet Union </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the world's great experiment with </v>

26
00:01:35.791 --> 00:01:39.180
<v Speaker 2>socialism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any form of one party centralization was</v>

27
00:01:39.181 --> 00:01:42.690
<v Speaker 2>a feared prospect by many.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One member of the Bruce Group,</v>

28
00:01:42.691 --> 00:01:43.524
<v Speaker 2>the historian Alan Scott,</v>
<v Speaker 2>took the idea a step further and </v>

29
00:01:46.261 --> 00:01:47.094
<v Speaker 2>launched his own political party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was called the Anti federalists </v>

30
00:01:50.101 --> 00:01:53.910
<v Speaker 2>league and it's one aim was to remove </v>
<v Speaker 2>Britain from the EU.</v>

31
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.700
<v Speaker 2>We call Rhonda and affairs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody can.</v>

32
00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.070
<v Speaker 2>This should be old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>too obvious,</v>

33
00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.680
<v Speaker 2>but skids party had problems from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>very start.</v>

34
00:02:01.681 --> 00:02:02.514
<v Speaker 2>In 1992,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the anti federalists league went up for </v>

35
00:02:04.201 --> 00:02:07.530
<v Speaker 2>only one seat in parliament and only got</v>
<v Speaker 2>point two percent of the vote,</v>

36
00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.560
<v Speaker 2>and it was the same in the European </v>
<v Speaker 2>elections in 1995.</v>

37
00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:11.693
<v Speaker 2>The young movement just lost faith in </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] ability to lead them and </v>

38
00:02:14.401 --> 00:02:18.030
<v Speaker 2>there were internal arguments about </v>
<v Speaker 2>whether the party which was soon renamed</v>

39
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.380
<v Speaker 2>Ukip or the United Kingdom Independence </v>
<v Speaker 2>Party should remain a single issue,</v>

40
00:02:22.381 --> 00:02:26.160
<v Speaker 2>pressure group or expand into other </v>
<v Speaker 2>issues and become a real party.</v>

41
00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.060
<v Speaker 2>That in 1994 arrival,</v>
<v Speaker 2>euro skeptic party called the referendum</v>

42
00:02:30.061 --> 00:02:31.830
<v Speaker 2>party,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exploded onto the scene,</v>

43
00:02:31.831 --> 00:02:33.960
<v Speaker 2>led by a billionaire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>James Goldsmith,</v>

44
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.450
<v Speaker 2>who had no such problems with </v>
<v Speaker 2>infighting.</v>

45
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.470
<v Speaker 2>All he wanted to do was have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>referendum about leaving the EU,</v>

46
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.333
<v Speaker 2>and once they got it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would dispatch a politician's </v>

47
00:02:45.091 --> 00:02:50.091
<v Speaker 2>betraying trust by holding a referendum </v>
<v Speaker 2>which is binding on the government.</v>

48
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.940
<v Speaker 2>The referendum party trounced Ukip in </v>
<v Speaker 2>1997,</v>

49
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.893
<v Speaker 2>but both were trounced by Tony Blair and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rise of New Labor which would hold </v>

50
00:02:57.961 --> 00:02:58.794
<v Speaker 2>the country for the next 13 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yet for those who were looking </v>

51
00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:04.120
<v Speaker 2>closely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was possible to see Elaine opening up</v>

52
00:03:04.121 --> 00:03:07.060
<v Speaker 2>for doubt about the EU.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In 92.</v>

53
00:03:07.061 --> 00:03:10.930
<v Speaker 2>Only nine percent thought Britain should</v>
<v Speaker 2>leave the EEC by 97.</v>

54
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:11.793
<v Speaker 2>That number had risen to 14 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you added to those who thought </v>

55
00:03:14.711 --> 00:03:15.544
<v Speaker 2>the EEC should at least reduce its </v>
<v Speaker 2>powers and you have 66 percent of the </v>

56
00:03:18.761 --> 00:03:21.730
<v Speaker 2>electorate expressing some form of euro </v>
<v Speaker 2>skepticism,</v>

57
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.360
<v Speaker 2>there are a number of reasons why Europe</v>
<v Speaker 2>was brought into voters' minds,</v>

58
00:03:25.361 --> 00:03:28.990
<v Speaker 2>but the most significant has got to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>the signing of the master treaty and the</v>

59
00:03:28.991 --> 00:03:30.700
<v Speaker 2>adoption of a single currency.</v>

60
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:31.533
<v Speaker 2>Something that in 1997,</v>
<v Speaker 2>only 16 percent of Britain's were in </v>

61
00:03:34.721 --> 00:03:38.260
<v Speaker 2>favor of despite these trends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can look dead in the water,</v>

62
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.990
<v Speaker 2>but it was about to hit a few strokes of</v>
<v Speaker 2>good luck.</v>

63
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.913
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad luck for James Goldsmith who passed </v>

64
00:03:43.751 --> 00:03:46.210
<v Speaker 2>away only three months after the 97 </v>
<v Speaker 2>election.</v>

65
00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:47.223
<v Speaker 2>Effectively disbanding Ukips only direct</v>
<v Speaker 2>competitor Alan scared was replaced by </v>

66
00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.100
<v Speaker 2>more aggressively populous figures like </v>
<v Speaker 2>Nigel Farrage,</v>

67
00:03:54.101 --> 00:03:54.934
<v Speaker 2>who was himself a seat in 1999.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And ironically the European Parliament </v>

68
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.260
<v Speaker 2>by 2001,</v>
<v Speaker 2>despite not winning any parliament seats</v>

69
00:04:02.261 --> 00:04:03.094
<v Speaker 2>in Westminster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ukip had become the fourth party in the </v>

70
00:04:05.171 --> 00:04:06.004
<v Speaker 2>UK.</v>
<v Speaker 2>After labor conservatives and the </v>

71
00:04:07.631 --> 00:04:10.090
<v Speaker 2>Liberal Democrats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their profile rose even more.</v>

72
00:04:10.091 --> 00:04:10.924
<v Speaker 2>When Robert Kilroy Silk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a former MP and chat show personality </v>

73
00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.963
<v Speaker 2>join the</v>

74
00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.953
<v Speaker 4>the main issue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>politicians in London decided to open </v>

75
00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:25.020
<v Speaker 4>our doors to a potential 70 million </v>
<v Speaker 4>migrants from eastern Europe.</v>

76
00:04:25.201 --> 00:04:26.580
<v Speaker 4>That $73 million</v>

77
00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.260
<v Speaker 2>kilroy silk was a controversial figure </v>
<v Speaker 2>stemming mostly from an article he wrote</v>

78
00:04:30.261 --> 00:04:32.720
<v Speaker 2>called we owe Arabs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>

79
00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:34.063
<v Speaker 2>Silk delivered you kips largest victory </v>
<v Speaker 2>in 2004 is European parliamentary </v>

80
00:04:37.701 --> 00:04:40.850
<v Speaker 2>elections coming in third above the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Liberal Democrats,</v>

81
00:04:40.851 --> 00:04:44.810
<v Speaker 2>but more infighting eventually ousted </v>
<v Speaker 2>him from the party within that year.</v>

82
00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:46.093
<v Speaker 2>Yet his example shows the willingness of</v>
<v Speaker 2>UK to engage in the worst forms of </v>

83
00:04:50.121 --> 00:04:51.390
<v Speaker 2>populism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>race,</v>

84
00:04:51.391 --> 00:04:52.940
<v Speaker 2>baiting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nationalism,</v>

85
00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:54.013
<v Speaker 2>and fear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Throughout the two thousands and into </v>

86
00:04:55.641 --> 00:04:56.474
<v Speaker 2>the 20 tens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you kept capitalized on a growing </v>

87
00:04:58.191 --> 00:04:59.024
<v Speaker 2>sentiment among the British people of </v>
<v Speaker 2>national decline in the post colonial </v>

88
00:05:02.331 --> 00:05:03.164
<v Speaker 2>era.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most keenly felt by the oldest citizens </v>

89
00:05:05.361 --> 00:05:07.730
<v Speaker 2>who made up the core of the vote to </v>
<v Speaker 2>brexit.</v>

90
00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:11.690
<v Speaker 2>They capitalized to on crises like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>financial meltdown in 2008,</v>

91
00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.450
<v Speaker 2>the riots that swept the country in </v>
<v Speaker 2>2011,</v>

92
00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.990
<v Speaker 2>and now the migrant crisis and </v>
<v Speaker 2>international terrorism,</v>

93
00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:19.283
<v Speaker 2>Ukip and the far right assigned folk </v>
<v Speaker 2>devils to many of these cases like </v>

94
00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:24.710
<v Speaker 2>immigrants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Muslims,</v>

95
00:05:24.711 --> 00:05:26.990
<v Speaker 2>minorities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and welfare recipients.</v>

96
00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.600
<v Speaker 2>All of these things can bolster </v>
<v Speaker 2>resentful,</v>

97
00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:30.463
<v Speaker 2>nationalism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they have to be triggered by </v>

98
00:05:31.701 --> 00:05:33.620
<v Speaker 2>something closer to home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In this case,</v>

99
00:05:33.621 --> 00:05:37.520
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the research points to the idea</v>
<v Speaker 2>of class trajectory.</v>

100
00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:38.430
<v Speaker 2>I have no</v>

101
00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:39.263
<v Speaker 5>p as all up in my area.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't get onto the housing ladder and </v>

102
00:05:41.791 --> 00:05:42.624
<v Speaker 5>have three kids in one room.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A place where I grew up is now was a </v>

103
00:05:45.151 --> 00:05:46.950
<v Speaker 5>lovely area,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's now a no go zone.</v>

104
00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:48.530
<v Speaker 5>How are you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mike?</v>

105
00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.670
<v Speaker 5>I can see my style of living in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My family's done living,</v>

106
00:05:50.671 --> 00:05:55.500
<v Speaker 5>going down because of this influx that </v>
<v Speaker 5>we can't control.</v>

107
00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:59.030
<v Speaker 2>You can't say that you kept is the soul </v>
<v Speaker 2>force behind Brexit,</v>

108
00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.953
<v Speaker 2>but they've been there throughout the </v>
<v Speaker 2>years to help link these real feelings </v>

109
00:06:03.711 --> 00:06:08.150
<v Speaker 2>of falling trajectories to emotions </v>
<v Speaker 2>about national decline and moral panics.</v>

110
00:06:08.151 --> 00:06:08.984
<v Speaker 2>That group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the public and fear growing from </v>

111
00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:13.730
<v Speaker 2>minuscule routes into a significant </v>
<v Speaker 2>player in the country's politics.</v>

112
00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.193
<v Speaker 2>The United Kingdom is not a far right </v>
<v Speaker 2>state with a nationalistic </v>

113
00:06:17.751 --> 00:06:18.584
<v Speaker 2>anti-immigrant and racist people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but their decision last week to leave </v>

114
00:06:21.351 --> 00:06:25.880
<v Speaker 2>the EU one by a 52 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>majority of 72 percent of the population</v>

115
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:30.920
<v Speaker 2>can be viewed as an expression of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>reactionary far right politics,</v>

116
00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.070
<v Speaker 2>and that's the point about far right </v>
<v Speaker 2>political organizations,</v>

117
00:06:34.071 --> 00:06:34.904
<v Speaker 2>they use the fulcrum of populism and </v>
<v Speaker 2>fear to lift many times their weight in </v>

118
00:06:39.741 --> 00:06:40.574
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The ideas that animated this vote are </v>

119
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:46.790
<v Speaker 2>there in Thatcher speech from 1988.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

120
00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:51.830
<v Speaker 2>the irony is that that's your herself </v>
<v Speaker 2>campaign for Britain to join the EEC the</v>

121
00:06:51.831 --> 00:06:52.664
<v Speaker 2>first time around in 1975.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The even greater irony is that the </v>

122
00:06:55.881 --> 00:06:56.714
<v Speaker 2>unchecked capitalism she championed as </v>
<v Speaker 2>prime minister lead to a form of </v>

123
00:07:00.351 --> 00:07:03.620
<v Speaker 2>globalization that has ravaged the </v>
<v Speaker 2>middle class,</v>

124
00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:04.633
<v Speaker 2>the real cause of the frustration that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you kept exploits to advocate of leaf </v>

125
00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:09.643
<v Speaker 2>foe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's the difference that 40 years </v>

126
00:07:12.021 --> 00:07:13.580
<v Speaker 2>can make.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brexit,</v>

127
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:14.623
<v Speaker 2>recontextualizes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these small phenomenon threads a </v>

128
00:07:17.581 --> 00:07:22.581
<v Speaker 2>string through them and shows that </v>
<v Speaker 2>transformation doesn't always</v>

129
00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:23.743
<v Speaker 6>have to.</v>

<v Speaker 2>it on twitter,</v>
