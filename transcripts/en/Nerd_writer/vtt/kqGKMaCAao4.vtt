00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:01.773
<v Speaker 1>Mm.</v>

2
00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:03.903
<v Speaker 2>Music videos are a weird art form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're often just a promotional add on </v>

3
00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.030
<v Speaker 2>to a medium that works just fine on its </v>
<v Speaker 2>own.</v>

4
00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:11.013
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think most of the time music works </v>

5
00:00:12.281 --> 00:00:16.420
<v Speaker 2>better without visuals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Videos seem to limit song somehow.</v>

6
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.660
<v Speaker 2>For me at least,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they closed down the possible ways I can</v>

7
00:00:19.661 --> 00:00:22.150
<v Speaker 2>experience the music most of the time.</v>

8
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.310
<v Speaker 3>Thirty minutes later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the feds watching it on my gosh.</v>

9
00:00:27.311 --> 00:00:29.310
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you ain't getting attempts.</v>

10
00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.450
<v Speaker 3>I'd be yelling stat in now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dual gram I do for content.</v>

11
00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.190
<v Speaker 2>Lamar is new.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Video for his song element is a powerful</v>

12
00:00:37.191 --> 00:00:41.270
<v Speaker 2>example of a music video actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>expanding my experience of a song rather</v>

13
00:00:41.271 --> 00:00:42.104
<v Speaker 2>than collapsing it and it's got me </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking again about what exactly makes </v>

14
00:00:45.561 --> 00:00:49.460
<v Speaker 2>for compelling work in this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in between medium watching this,</v>

15
00:00:49.461 --> 00:00:52.310
<v Speaker 2>I think the answer has something to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>with collaboration.</v>

16
00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:53.323
<v Speaker 2>Kendrick is known for a lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He occupies a really rarefied place in </v>

17
00:00:56.601 --> 00:00:57.434
<v Speaker 2>popular culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>celebrated for quality and integrity </v>

18
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.930
<v Speaker 2>pretty much across the board with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>couple of notable exceptions.</v>

19
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:03.793
<v Speaker 2>This is why I say that hip hop is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>more damaged to young African Americans </v>

20
00:01:07.881 --> 00:01:08.714
<v Speaker 2>than racism in recent years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we'll get back to that in a little </v>

21
00:01:12.471 --> 00:01:13.304
<v Speaker 2>while.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that's less talked </v>

22
00:01:14.211 --> 00:01:17.720
<v Speaker 2>about is Kendrick's ability to work </v>
<v Speaker 2>seamlessly with other artists.</v>

23
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.853
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>collaboration is sort of a prerequisite </v>

24
00:01:20.841 --> 00:01:23.540
<v Speaker 2>for hip hop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could rap music depends on the fusion of</v>

25
00:01:23.541 --> 00:01:24.710
<v Speaker 2>lyrics and production.</v>

26
00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:25.723
<v Speaker 2>Kendrick's role as a marquee artists and</v>
<v Speaker 2>hip hop is a lot like that of a film </v>

27
00:01:28.821 --> 00:01:29.654
<v Speaker 2>director who acts in his own work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He can control the lyrical content and </v>

28
00:01:32.481 --> 00:01:33.314
<v Speaker 2>its delivery himself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also up to him to choose other </v>

29
00:01:35.631 --> 00:01:36.464
<v Speaker 2>artists according to their strengths and</v>
<v Speaker 2>help them realize their own creativity </v>

30
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.173
<v Speaker 2>in the service of his vision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Working with him throughout the process </v>

31
00:01:43.431 --> 00:01:46.700
<v Speaker 2>for me was like very.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like being needed,</v>

32
00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:48.380
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a piece of dough,</v>

33
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.393
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It felt like somebody was like bending </v>

34
00:01:50.271 --> 00:01:51.570
<v Speaker 2>and stretching into like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

35
00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pulling different things out.</v>

36
00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:54.403
<v Speaker 2>It's this kind of skill for directorial </v>
<v Speaker 2>collaboration that makes Kendrick's </v>

37
00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.110
<v Speaker 2>music videos so strong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To understand the element video,</v>

38
00:02:00.111 --> 00:02:03.560
<v Speaker 2>you have to understand first the </v>
<v Speaker 2>collaborators in this case,</v>

39
00:02:03.561 --> 00:02:05.810
<v Speaker 2>there are two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one living and one dead.</v>

40
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.033
<v Speaker 2>The first is Jonas Lindstrom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a commercial fashion photographer from </v>

41
00:02:09.921 --> 00:02:13.550
<v Speaker 2>Berlin lindstrom directed the video </v>
<v Speaker 2>alongside the little homies,</v>

42
00:02:13.551 --> 00:02:16.310
<v Speaker 2>which is a pseudonym for Kendrick and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Dave free.</v>

43
00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.173
<v Speaker 2>The president of top Dawg entertainment </v>
<v Speaker 2>element is highly reminiscent of </v>

44
00:02:19.911 --> 00:02:22.670
<v Speaker 2>Lindstrom previous work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>namely his short film,</v>

45
00:02:22.671 --> 00:02:23.504
<v Speaker 2>truth or dare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which features 21 performances or </v>

46
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.320
<v Speaker 2>vignettes and elevated version of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>content found on mobile phones.</v>

47
00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.290
<v Speaker 2>Interested in the boundary between </v>
<v Speaker 2>photography and film.</v>

48
00:02:33.291 --> 00:02:34.124
<v Speaker 2>Lindstrom is great at creating these </v>
<v Speaker 2>slow moving tableaus that serve as a </v>

49
00:02:37.671 --> 00:02:40.670
<v Speaker 2>reference point for a larger environment</v>
<v Speaker 2>in element.</v>

50
00:02:40.671 --> 00:02:41.504
<v Speaker 2>Kendrick has them apply that to his own,</v>
<v Speaker 2>namely to the violence that's been an </v>

51
00:02:44.751 --> 00:02:47.390
<v Speaker 2>inescapable fact of that environment for</v>
<v Speaker 2>his whole life.</v>

52
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.330
<v Speaker 2>Violence has always been a preoccupation</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Kendrick's work.</v>

53
00:02:50.331 --> 00:02:51.164
<v Speaker 2>He's examined it from every angle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Looking at the violence that he's </v>

54
00:02:53.661 --> 00:02:56.240
<v Speaker 2>endured sometimes at the hands of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>closest to him.</v>

55
00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.270
<v Speaker 3>At this data in front of my Mama,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my comes every medic</v>

56
00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.600
<v Speaker 2>to come us bit jummah grandma's bed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so when a buddy brand for me,</v>

57
00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:07.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm on your head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The violence he's caused,</v>

58
00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:08.683
<v Speaker 2>the violence used to oppress his race </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the violence is friends and family </v>

59
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:13.293
<v Speaker 2>visit on themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Each of these facets of violence is </v>

60
00:03:16.301 --> 00:03:20.110
<v Speaker 2>distilled into a photographic moments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of them connect,</v>

61
00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.393
<v Speaker 2>but they're scrambled drawing you into </v>
<v Speaker 2>this churning cycle of violence that is </v>

62
00:03:24.491 --> 00:03:25.324
<v Speaker 2>the result of all these distinct images.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kendrick can't be sure that he himself </v>

63
00:03:29.771 --> 00:03:34.000
<v Speaker 2>hasn't contributed to this cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's deeply conflicted about his violent</v>

64
00:03:34.001 --> 00:03:38.080
<v Speaker 2>past and about his position as wraps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quote unquote savior.</v>

65
00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.070
<v Speaker 2>Following the rapturous reception of his</v>
<v Speaker 2>last album to pimp a butterfly.</v>

66
00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.370
<v Speaker 2>In many ways dam is a rebuke to that </v>
<v Speaker 2>perceived divine status and element is a</v>

67
00:03:47.411 --> 00:03:48.244
<v Speaker 2>prime example of that rebuke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Showing that he's not above hip hop's </v>

68
00:03:51.041 --> 00:03:53.710
<v Speaker 2>competitive shit talking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just that they wouldn't go see me,</v>

69
00:03:53.711 --> 00:03:54.340
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

70
00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.260
<v Speaker 2>Nigga stop decade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That real life at the same light.</v>

71
00:03:56.261 --> 00:03:57.094
<v Speaker 2>The CLTV Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just want to flex Somia P and l a </v>

72
00:03:59.051 --> 00:03:59.910
<v Speaker 2>for free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

73
00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.440
<v Speaker 2>Next time that you get the 10 freeway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need receipt on.</v>

74
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:03.423
<v Speaker 2>The one thing Kendrick Lamar is sure </v>
<v Speaker 2>about is that the music itself is not </v>

75
00:04:07.301 --> 00:04:08.134
<v Speaker 2>the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is why I say that hip hop has done </v>

76
00:04:09.971 --> 00:04:14.650
<v Speaker 2>more damage to young African Americans </v>
<v Speaker 2>than racism in recent years.</v>

77
00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:16.900
<v Speaker 2>Kendrick plays the sample elsewhere on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the album.</v>

78
00:04:16.901 --> 00:04:18.790
<v Speaker 2>Clearly it's something he's wrestled </v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

79
00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.960
<v Speaker 2>but for Kendrick music is a way to cope </v>
<v Speaker 2>with an understand his world,</v>

80
00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.823
<v Speaker 2>not the cause of its ills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is where his second </v>

81
00:04:26.441 --> 00:04:27.274
<v Speaker 2>collaborator comes in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three of the shots in elephant are </v>

82
00:04:29.561 --> 00:04:32.350
<v Speaker 2>direct references to the work of Gordon </v>
<v Speaker 2>Parks.</v>

83
00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.780
<v Speaker 2>One of America's all time great photo </v>
<v Speaker 2>journalists and filmmakers.</v>

84
00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:36.813
<v Speaker 2>Parks was the first prominent commercial</v>
<v Speaker 2>photographer to capture the black </v>

85
00:04:40.001 --> 00:04:40.834
<v Speaker 2>experience for a nationwide audience is </v>
<v Speaker 2>focused on the inner cities for life </v>

86
00:04:44.291 --> 00:04:47.230
<v Speaker 2>magazine was hugely important during </v>
<v Speaker 2>that period,</v>

87
00:04:47.231 --> 00:04:48.064
<v Speaker 2>and the power of his photography is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>it forces people to see what would </v>

88
00:04:51.641 --> 00:04:52.474
<v Speaker 2>otherwise remain invisible to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Parks was heralded for his ability to </v>

89
00:04:55.931 --> 00:04:56.764
<v Speaker 2>get close to his subjects,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to earn their trust so that he could </v>

90
00:04:58.931 --> 00:05:01.570
<v Speaker 2>eliminate the intimate truths of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>lives.</v>

91
00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.390
<v Speaker 2>I'll give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a fuck.</v>

92
00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:05.980
<v Speaker 2>I don't give up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't give up.</v>

93
00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:07.053
<v Speaker 2>Don't give a fuck</v>

94
00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:11.703
<v Speaker 2>by citing parks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kendrick aligns their artistic goals he </v>

95
00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:15.213
<v Speaker 2>liked parks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>commits to depicting the realities of </v>

96
00:05:16.841 --> 00:05:17.674
<v Speaker 2>his community with clear eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if that means depicting himself as </v>

97
00:05:21.101 --> 00:05:21.934
<v Speaker 2>the product of a violent culture or a </v>
<v Speaker 2>violent country or sometimes as someone </v>

98
00:05:26.171 --> 00:05:29.920
<v Speaker 2>who perpetuates those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a big fan of music videos,</v>

99
00:05:29.921 --> 00:05:30.754
<v Speaker 2>but the way Kendrick brings the visions </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Lindstrom and parks into sync with </v>

100
00:05:34.181 --> 00:05:35.014
<v Speaker 2>his own,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his masterful the result of the </v>

101
00:05:36.551 --> 00:05:37.384
<v Speaker 2>collaboration is a music video that </v>
<v Speaker 2>operates a lot more like a poem that </v>

102
00:05:40.631 --> 00:05:44.700
<v Speaker 2>connects the song and the album's </v>
<v Speaker 2>content with more touchstones,</v>

103
00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:45.653
<v Speaker 2>not less element is a video that lets </v>
<v Speaker 2>you look into Kendrick's world and in </v>

104
00:05:49.031 --> 00:05:53.440
<v Speaker 2>the end for a brief terrifying moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>forces you to see through its eyes.</v>

105
00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:56.090
<v Speaker 2>Got It,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got the,</v>

106
00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:04.670
<v Speaker 2>made it look sexy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My element by element.</v>

107
00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:14.400
<v Speaker 2>Hey everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank you so much for watching.</v>

108
00:06:14.401 --> 00:06:17.220
<v Speaker 2>This episode was brought to you by </v>
<v Speaker 2>Casper mattresses.</v>

109
00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:20.190
<v Speaker 2>There is a mattress in this box right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

110
00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:21.353
<v Speaker 2>It's actually a really cool sponsorship </v>
<v Speaker 2>for us because we needed a new mattress </v>

111
00:06:24.421 --> 00:06:26.610
<v Speaker 2>in our bedroom and casper's are really </v>
<v Speaker 2>comfortable.</v>

112
00:06:26.611 --> 00:06:27.444
<v Speaker 2>I had one when I was living in San </v>
<v Speaker 2>Francisco and I've been meaning to get </v>

113
00:06:29.911 --> 00:06:30.301
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

114
00:06:30.301 --> 00:06:33.390
<v Speaker 2>it's a foam mattress that comes </v>
<v Speaker 2>delivered in a box just like this,</v>

115
00:06:33.391 --> 00:06:35.850
<v Speaker 2>and when you open it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it expands into the size.</v>

116
00:06:35.851 --> 00:06:38.640
<v Speaker 2>In this case of a Queen Mattress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me show you how it works.</v>

117
00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:40.020
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this is insanely easy.</v>

118
00:06:40.021 --> 00:06:43.050
<v Speaker 2>You take the mattress out of the box </v>
<v Speaker 2>like you can see me doing right here.</v>

119
00:06:43.051 --> 00:06:43.884
<v Speaker 2>You unfurl it on the bed frame and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>just remove the vacuum sealed plastic </v>

120
00:06:46.081 --> 00:06:46.914
<v Speaker 2>wrap and it expands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The mattresses are obsessively </v>

121
00:06:49.111 --> 00:06:49.944
<v Speaker 2>engineered to have the ideal amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>firmness and balance and it's foam </v>

122
00:06:53.371 --> 00:06:54.204
<v Speaker 2>layers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's super affordable because it's sold </v>

123
00:06:55.951 --> 00:06:56.784
<v Speaker 2>directly to consumers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get free shipping and 100 day free </v>

124
00:06:58.861 --> 00:07:00.960
<v Speaker 2>trial with no hassle returns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're not happy,</v>

125
00:07:00.961 --> 00:07:04.230
<v Speaker 2>and if you go to casper.com</v>
