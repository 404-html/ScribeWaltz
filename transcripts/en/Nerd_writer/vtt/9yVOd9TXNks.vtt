1
00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:04.070
<v Speaker 1>If Jonathan winters was never accused of</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>

2
00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:05.263
<v Speaker 1>he's got the perfect alibi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was someone else at the time when I </v>

3
00:00:09.171 --> 00:00:10.004
<v Speaker 1>first saw him before the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was still trying to decide </v>

4
00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.830
<v Speaker 1>whether he could be a drunken Eskimo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the queen of the Vikings,</v>

5
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.740
<v Speaker 1>or a door knob.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd read it.</v>

6
00:00:18.741 --> 00:00:19.574
<v Speaker 1>He came out to begin with because when </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's johnny winter cannot be in the </v>

7
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.580
<v Speaker 1>wild,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wild man,</v>

8
00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:26.980
<v Speaker 1>my friend Jonathan with</v>

9
00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.290
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's impossible to understand the genius</v>

10
00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.153
<v Speaker 2>of the late Robin Williams without first</v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding the corresponding genius </v>

11
00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.460
<v Speaker 2>of his idol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jonathan winters.</v>

12
00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:43.323
<v Speaker 2>Winters was the master of </v>
<v Speaker 2>improvisational comedy from the early </v>

13
00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.950
<v Speaker 2>days of TV in his standup and various </v>
<v Speaker 2>sketch appearances on talk shows.</v>

14
00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:55.240
<v Speaker 2>What he did was never scripted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The characters he invented.</v>

15
00:00:55.241 --> 00:00:59.560
<v Speaker 2>The scenes he enacted were plucked from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the air in front of his eyes.</v>

16
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.230
<v Speaker 3>The kids had some candy and nation that </v>
<v Speaker 3>did that.</v>

17
00:01:02.231 --> 00:01:03.064
<v Speaker 3>They come to the river.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a barrier here and we will get </v>

18
00:01:05.631 --> 00:01:08.410
<v Speaker 3>some pictures of the bear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The bear ate together,</v>

19
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.240
<v Speaker 1>but we got some wonderful backdrop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of winters,</v>

20
00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.350
<v Speaker 2>most famous and simplest bits was called</v>
<v Speaker 2>the stick from the Jack Paar.</v>

21
00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.670
<v Speaker 1>What can you do a routine with you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give them anything.</v>

22
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.750
<v Speaker 1>Why am I went to a pretty good cash when</v>
<v Speaker 1>I grind time,</v>

23
00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.950
<v Speaker 1>Margaret bloody dogs just up there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just this side of the green trailers.</v>

24
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:55.463
<v Speaker 2>Seven years later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another comedian did a very similar </v>

25
00:01:58.171 --> 00:02:02.010
<v Speaker 2>routine with a Pashmina on inside the </v>
<v Speaker 2>actor's studio.</v>

26
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.390
<v Speaker 3>I came to Bombay.</v>

27
00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:05.783
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

28
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.610
<v Speaker 3>we are going to cook octopus football.</v>

29
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.710
<v Speaker 2>Williams and Jonathan winters were </v>
<v Speaker 2>kindred spirits.</v>

30
00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.110
<v Speaker 2>They work together for the first time on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the TV show.</v>

31
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.153
<v Speaker 2>Mork and mindy winters played his son,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from which point they remained great </v>

32
00:02:29.911 --> 00:02:34.350
<v Speaker 2>friends until winters death in 2013,</v>
<v Speaker 2>only a year and change it.</v>

33
00:02:34.351 --> 00:02:35.184
<v Speaker 2>Turns out before Robin Williams took his</v>
<v Speaker 2>own life in this clip from a 60 minutes </v>

34
00:02:38.341 --> 00:02:39.174
<v Speaker 2>profile on winters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's Robin Williams who expresses the </v>

35
00:02:42.241 --> 00:02:43.074
<v Speaker 2>great lesson that his mentor taught him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was indeed the great philosophy of </v>

36
00:02:47.131 --> 00:02:48.000
<v Speaker 2>both their comedians.</v>

37
00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.600
<v Speaker 3>Jonathan has just taught me about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world is open for play,</v>

38
00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.900
<v Speaker 3>is that anything and everybody is </v>
<v Speaker 3>marketable in a wonderful way.</v>

39
00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.130
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the world</v>

40
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.780
<v Speaker 4>is open for play.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an extremely rich one.</v>

41
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:04.803
<v Speaker 4>It suggests rightly that humanity and </v>
<v Speaker 4>our shared reality is made up of fluid </v>

42
00:03:09.431 --> 00:03:10.264
<v Speaker 4>elements of language and social </v>
<v Speaker 4>structures which are sometimes codified </v>

43
00:03:13.811 --> 00:03:14.644
<v Speaker 4>into rules and pressures and laws,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that even the most rigid feature of </v>

44
00:03:18.881 --> 00:03:23.881
<v Speaker 4>what man makes can be turned flexible </v>
<v Speaker 4>again and malleable again and funny with</v>

45
00:03:24.281 --> 00:03:25.114
<v Speaker 4>play winters and Williams saw reality </v>
<v Speaker 4>for its basic elements and felt a grand </v>

46
00:03:29.681 --> 00:03:30.514
<v Speaker 4>freedom in their work to rearrange those</v>
<v Speaker 4>elements into hilarious parodies of our </v>

47
00:03:34.881 --> 00:03:35.810
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gosh,</v>

48
00:03:35.811 --> 00:03:40.811
<v Speaker 4>I was so taken with this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was when I first first met him and I'm</v>

49
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.770
<v Speaker 4>working Monday.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We we did.</v>

50
00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.410
<v Speaker 4>We had a marvelous time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your good days,</v>

51
00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.080
<v Speaker 4>you had access to more medication and </v>
<v Speaker 4>will</v>

52
00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:52.333
<v Speaker 2>williams exceeded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even the master was in his dramatic </v>

53
00:03:55.551 --> 00:03:56.384
<v Speaker 2>scope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not only could he create exaggerations </v>

54
00:03:57.891 --> 00:03:58.724
<v Speaker 2>of character in his comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he had the ability to reproduce the </v>

55
00:04:01.161 --> 00:04:03.380
<v Speaker 2>subtleties of character as well.</v>

56
00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.590
<v Speaker 5>Feeling like God put an angel on earth </v>
<v Speaker 5>for you to rescue you from the depths of</v>

57
00:04:09.531 --> 00:04:12.610
<v Speaker 5>hell when you wouldn't know what it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>like to be arranged,</v>

58
00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.520
<v Speaker 5>to have that love for her to be there </v>
<v Speaker 5>forever.</v>

59
00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:20.370
<v Speaker 2>In the end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both talents reflect the same empathetic</v>

60
00:04:20.371 --> 00:04:21.204
<v Speaker 2>observation of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>winters and Williams like no one else </v>

61
00:04:24.271 --> 00:04:29.271
<v Speaker 2>before or since understood the </v>
<v Speaker 2>stereotypes in subtlety and the subtlety</v>

62
00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.600
<v Speaker 2>and exaggeration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It may seem as if this sublime energy of</v>

63
00:04:33.601 --> 00:04:38.100
<v Speaker 2>play passes away with them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but of course the opposite is true.</v>

64
00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:43.050
<v Speaker 2>We have that energy for all time because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they gave it to us,</v>

65
00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:44.543
<v Speaker 3>reverend angel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my hands or our credit because you can </v>

66
00:04:46.651 --> 00:04:47.484
<v Speaker 3>tell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I just consider him not as hands </v>

67
00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:49.950
<v Speaker 3>anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but his paws.</v>

68
00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.050
<v Speaker 3>And be ready to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get a little cat tree.</v>

69
00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.980
<v Speaker 3>Don't be afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't be afraid.</v>

70
00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.430
<v Speaker 3>My hands on your head now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're in my hands.</v>

71
00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.880
<v Speaker 3>Why would you put your hand on my head?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because that's not the America.</v>

72
00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.000
<v Speaker 3>Go with me to work with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Work with my demon spirit.</v>

73
00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.570
<v Speaker 3>Bobby.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get the extra hands straight out.</v>

74
00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.710
<v Speaker 3>Straight out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you can serve things.</v>

75
00:05:13.711 --> 00:05:14.670
<v Speaker 3>Go table 14.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Able.</v>

76
00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:16.920
<v Speaker 3>Oh Man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't get them back that way.</v>

77
00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.800
<v Speaker 3>How do you get them back for it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look horrible.</v>

78
00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.280
<v Speaker 3>This is called [inaudible] Syndrome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A tendency to be in a box for no reason,</v>

79
00:05:23.281 --> 00:05:26.720
<v Speaker 3>for horrible long periods and of to walk</v>
<v Speaker 3>against the wind when there is no win.</v>

80
00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.400
<v Speaker 3>Why don't you please help a as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible thing to waste?</v>

81
00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:35.630
<v Speaker 3>You're really saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not me as a terrible look at this.</v>

82
00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.230
<v Speaker 3>This also means surrender.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

83
00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.880
<v Speaker 3>so basically the Egyptian army training </v>
<v Speaker 3>course.</v>

84
00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:39.661
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ready?</v>

85
00:05:39.661 --> 00:05:43.090
<v Speaker 3>Drop gun again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One time that I've done.</v>

86
00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:48.730
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gotten all this money.</v>
