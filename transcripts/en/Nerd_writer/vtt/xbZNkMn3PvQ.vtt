1
00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:03.153
<v Speaker 1>Mm,</v>

2
00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.370
<v Speaker 2>I</v>

3
00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:23.600
<v Speaker 1>think it's okay to start my analysis of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Guillermo del Toro's,</v>

4
00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:28.190
<v Speaker 1>Pan's labyrinth with a spoiler Ofelia </v>
<v Speaker 1>the main character.</v>

5
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:29.323
<v Speaker 1>She dies at the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel fine doing that because del Toro </v>

6
00:00:33.411 --> 00:00:35.870
<v Speaker 1>does the exact same thing with his </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>

7
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.983
<v Speaker 1>The first shot of Pan's labyrinth is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ending and it's also the first way in </v>

8
00:00:40.401 --> 00:00:44.360
<v Speaker 1>which deltoro complicates that epic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but before we get into that,</v>

9
00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.380
<v Speaker 1>a few things about fairytales,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for most of us,</v>

10
00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.410
<v Speaker 1>the authoritative source for fairytales </v>
<v Speaker 1>is Walt Disney and that's no accident.</v>

11
00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.290
<v Speaker 1>Disney set out to claim that authority </v>
<v Speaker 1>when he made films like snow,</v>

12
00:00:57.291 --> 00:01:01.310
<v Speaker 1>White Cinderella,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sleeping beauty by adapting folktales in</v>

13
00:01:01.311 --> 00:01:02.144
<v Speaker 1>the public domain and copywriting the </v>
<v Speaker 1>adaptations still because film was a </v>

14
00:01:06.051 --> 00:01:06.884
<v Speaker 1>relatively new medium.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Capturing the authority he wanted </v>

15
00:01:09.381 --> 00:01:10.214
<v Speaker 1>require Disney to remain faithful to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>original versions of these stories </v>

16
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.390
<v Speaker 1>popularized by Charles perrow and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>brothers Grimm.</v>

17
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:18.583
<v Speaker 1>He made the transition from print to </v>
<v Speaker 1>cinema as smooth as possible for the </v>

18
00:01:21.651 --> 00:01:24.560
<v Speaker 1>audience even going so far as to begin </v>
<v Speaker 1>his movies.</v>

19
00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.740
<v Speaker 1>With the opening of a book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Disney was smart.</v>

20
00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:28.813
<v Speaker 1>His films are now regarded as classics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet by remaining so faithful to the </v>

21
00:01:32.841 --> 00:01:33.674
<v Speaker 1>stories 19th century antecedents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he inherited and furthered their 19th </v>

22
00:01:38.181 --> 00:01:39.014
<v Speaker 1>century morality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a conservative patriarchal value system </v>

23
00:01:42.531 --> 00:01:46.000
<v Speaker 1>in which the prince always comes to save</v>
<v Speaker 1>the helpless heroin,</v>

24
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.850
<v Speaker 1>a value system that was antiquated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even then in this way,</v>

25
00:01:49.851 --> 00:01:54.851
<v Speaker 1>Disney limited the kinds of things a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fairytale can do in Pan's labyrinth.</v>

26
00:01:55.941 --> 00:01:56.774
<v Speaker 1>Guillermo del Toro attempts to explode </v>
<v Speaker 1>these limitations and he does so by </v>

27
00:02:00.381 --> 00:02:02.270
<v Speaker 1>recontextualizing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These stories,</v>

28
00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.940
<v Speaker 1>instead of pulling from a single </v>
<v Speaker 1>authoritative source,</v>

29
00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.030
<v Speaker 1>del Toro pulls from a huge number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sources,</v>

30
00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.013
<v Speaker 1>giving none precedence over the others </v>
<v Speaker 1>and letting them all play against one </v>

31
00:02:12.291 --> 00:02:13.124
<v Speaker 1>another to create meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The film tells the story of the little </v>

32
00:02:15.561 --> 00:02:16.394
<v Speaker 1>girl Ofelia and her mother Carmen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as they go to live with the hyper </v>

33
00:02:19.551 --> 00:02:21.290
<v Speaker 1>fascist to captain vidal.</v>

34
00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:22.363
<v Speaker 1>Five years after the Spanish civil war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Dallas trying to sniff out the last </v>

35
00:02:25.641 --> 00:02:29.900
<v Speaker 1>remnants of rebellion in the mountains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>awaiting his child's birth by Carmen.</v>

36
00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.973
<v Speaker 1>While Ofelia becomes ensnared in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>magical quest after a fond tells her </v>

37
00:02:35.031 --> 00:02:38.180
<v Speaker 1>that she is the lost princess of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>underground realm.</v>

38
00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:39.673
<v Speaker 1>From here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the story spins out into two parallel </v>

39
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:42.703
<v Speaker 1>narratives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the magical quest and the political </v>

40
00:02:44.811 --> 00:02:46.190
<v Speaker 1>drama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crucially,</v>

41
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.000
<v Speaker 1>neither of these narratives becomes </v>
<v Speaker 1>reducible to the other.</v>

42
00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.983
<v Speaker 1>Del Toro makes a point of this by </v>
<v Speaker 1>entwining them in ways that makes any </v>

43
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.980
<v Speaker 1>totalizing explanation problematic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the end of the film,</v>

44
00:02:57.981 --> 00:02:58.814
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we get seems to be the nail in the </v>

45
00:03:00.671 --> 00:03:01.504
<v Speaker 1>coffin for the magical quest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but dol approaches Ofelia speaking with </v>

46
00:03:04.721 --> 00:03:07.420
<v Speaker 1>the font and when the camera cuts to his</v>
<v Speaker 1>point of view,</v>

47
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:08.673
<v Speaker 1>the font is not there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This appears to be solid evidence for </v>

48
00:03:10.871 --> 00:03:15.280
<v Speaker 1>those who read Ofelia's quest as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>coping mechanism for her set life,</v>

49
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:16.503
<v Speaker 1>but if we back up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can see how Deltoro complicates that </v>

50
00:03:19.691 --> 00:03:20.524
<v Speaker 1>reading by remembering that the dol has </v>
<v Speaker 1>just been drugged with a heavy dose of </v>

51
00:03:23.471 --> 00:03:25.510
<v Speaker 1>sleeping medication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other stories,</v>

52
00:03:25.511 --> 00:03:26.344
<v Speaker 1>drug induced hallucinations are used to </v>
<v Speaker 1>explain a way why people see the </v>

53
00:03:29.381 --> 00:03:31.780
<v Speaker 1>supernatural,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in Pan's labyrinth,</v>

54
00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:32.793
<v Speaker 1>it's the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Del Toro uses the device to destabilize </v>

55
00:03:35.951 --> 00:03:39.070
<v Speaker 1>our trust in Captain v Dot Dallas point </v>
<v Speaker 1>of view here and elsewhere.</v>

56
00:03:39.071 --> 00:03:44.071
<v Speaker 1>The film refuses to obey our desire for </v>
<v Speaker 1>an all encompassing explanation.</v>

57
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:45.333
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>disobedience is a major theme in this </v>

58
00:03:47.711 --> 00:03:48.544
<v Speaker 1>film</v>

59
00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:54.250
<v Speaker 3>I see,</v>

60
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.873
<v Speaker 1>whereas in many fairytales,</v>
<v Speaker 1>disobedience is the act that sets the </v>

61
00:04:03.551 --> 00:04:04.384
<v Speaker 1>story in motion here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Disobedience is framed as a vital and </v>

62
00:04:07.841 --> 00:04:08.674
<v Speaker 1>important quality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the disobedience of the rebels </v>

63
00:04:11.081 --> 00:04:13.450
<v Speaker 1>who seek to free Spain from the grip of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fascism,</v>

64
00:04:13.451 --> 00:04:16.000
<v Speaker 1>the disobedience of Mercedes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who works with the rebels,</v>

65
00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.073
<v Speaker 1>and of course the disobedience of Ofelia</v>
<v Speaker 1>who by turns questions and disregards </v>

66
00:04:21.341 --> 00:04:25.060
<v Speaker 1>the commands of her mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the captain and the font,</v>

67
00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.073
<v Speaker 1>but the most effective and I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>impressive disobedience here is that </v>

68
00:04:29.441 --> 00:04:32.290
<v Speaker 1>displayed within the very text of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie,</v>

69
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.830
<v Speaker 1>and this is where del Toro's intense </v>
<v Speaker 1>referencing comes into play.</v>

70
00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.980
<v Speaker 1>The name of the game here is </v>
<v Speaker 1>multiplicity,</v>

71
00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:39.993
<v Speaker 1>undermining a single authoritarian </v>
<v Speaker 1>master narrative like those champion by </v>

72
00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.840
<v Speaker 1>the dol and fascism in general by </v>
<v Speaker 1>setting up a network of inter texts that</v>

73
00:04:49.061 --> 00:04:53.470
<v Speaker 1>make meaning a matter of choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think of all the linking references in</v>

74
00:04:53.471 --> 00:04:55.150
<v Speaker 1>the pale man scene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

75
00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.193
<v Speaker 1>you have the ogre himself nodding to </v>
<v Speaker 1>other child eating ogres and other </v>

76
00:04:58.811 --> 00:05:00.460
<v Speaker 1>mythologies like krampus.</v>

77
00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.130
<v Speaker 1>It also refers to the Greek Titan </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kronos,</v>

78
00:05:03.131 --> 00:05:06.580
<v Speaker 1>who devoured his god.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Children in order to like fascist Spain,</v>

79
00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:10.000
<v Speaker 1>keep the young from replacing them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming into their own.</v>

80
00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.073
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it should be noted that Kronos is the </v>

81
00:05:12.101 --> 00:05:12.934
<v Speaker 1>title of Del Toro's first film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of many things that links his body </v>

82
00:05:16.121 --> 00:05:16.954
<v Speaker 1>of work together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The table itself links back to the </v>

83
00:05:18.551 --> 00:05:19.384
<v Speaker 1>banquet scene earlier in the film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>putting the Pale man in the same </v>

84
00:05:21.521 --> 00:05:24.400
<v Speaker 1>position as the Dell who will go on to </v>
<v Speaker 1>kill a child.</v>

85
00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:25.293
<v Speaker 1>The pile of shoes link forward and we'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>go on to recontextualize Ofelia's red </v>

86
00:05:29.081 --> 00:05:29.914
<v Speaker 1>shoes itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a link to the wizard of Oz and the 1948 </v>

87
00:05:33.041 --> 00:05:37.630
<v Speaker 1>film by Powell and Pressburger </v>
<v Speaker 1>recontextualize as images reminiscent of</v>

88
00:05:37.631 --> 00:05:42.631
<v Speaker 1>the piles of clothes from Nazi </v>
<v Speaker 1>concentration camps and the scene itself</v>

89
00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.120
<v Speaker 1>functions as a metaphor for how beauty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like say,</v>

90
00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:47.013
<v Speaker 1>the beauty of old fairytales can enchant</v>
<v Speaker 1>us into certain lines and ways of </v>

91
00:05:51.161 --> 00:05:53.650
<v Speaker 1>thinking that may not be in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>interest.</v>

92
00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:55.503
<v Speaker 1>Here you have constructed a vast network</v>
<v Speaker 1>of citation that reaches elsewhere in </v>

93
00:05:59.571 --> 00:06:00.404
<v Speaker 1>the film and outside of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The lines of that network are for the </v>

94
00:06:03.831 --> 00:06:08.630
<v Speaker 1>viewers to follow as they see fit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Del Toro laces these references together</v>

95
00:06:08.631 --> 00:06:09.464
<v Speaker 1>with camera work and editing to achieve </v>
<v Speaker 1>a narrative momentum that's undeniable </v>

96
00:06:13.401 --> 00:06:14.234
<v Speaker 1>when you watch his movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the purpose of the doll like it </v>

97
00:06:18.201 --> 00:06:19.034
<v Speaker 1>is the purpose of all authoritarian </v>
<v Speaker 1>regimes or patriarchal moralistic </v>

98
00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:23.563
<v Speaker 1>fairytales to limit the number and kinds</v>
<v Speaker 1>of stories that can be told from a set </v>

99
00:06:28.371 --> 00:06:32.780
<v Speaker 1>of facts or events.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indeed limited to one story.</v>

100
00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:38.620
<v Speaker 1>The only thing for us is to disobey you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In old fairytales.</v>

101
00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:43.010
<v Speaker 1>The stories were closed out in contained</v>
<v Speaker 1>by two words.</v>

102
00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:48.280
<v Speaker 1>The end adult touros genius is to use </v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps this most formulaic genre of all</v>

103
00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:54.760
<v Speaker 1>and disobey our expectations and how it </v>
<v Speaker 1>should unfold and how it should end.</v>

104
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:55.663
<v Speaker 1>The rebels capture and kill the doll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Spain will continue under </v>

105
00:06:59.241 --> 00:07:03.740
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian dictatorship for 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ophelia is murdered,</v>

106
00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:07.400
<v Speaker 1>but completes her quest and returns to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the underground realm.</v>

107
00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:11.360
<v Speaker 1>Or you can read that as a poetic ending </v>
<v Speaker 1>to a sad story,</v>

108
00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:12.403
<v Speaker 1>but happy ending to a fairytale or </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ophelia's final choice of the story she </v>

109
00:07:17.181 --> 00:07:21.080
<v Speaker 1>wants to tell for and about herself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

110
00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:22.020
<v Speaker 1>she doesn't have</v>

111
00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:22.853
<v Speaker 4>to choose at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No single story could contain her for </v>

112
00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:30.360
<v Speaker 4>even when she returned to the world of </v>
<v Speaker 4>magic,</v>

113
00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:35.820
<v Speaker 4>it has said she left small traces of her</v>
<v Speaker 4>time on earth,</v>

114
00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:38.100
<v Speaker 4>visible to those who know where</v>

115
00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:40.470
<v Speaker 5>and how to look.</v>
