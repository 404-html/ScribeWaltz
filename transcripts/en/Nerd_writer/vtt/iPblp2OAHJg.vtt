<v Speaker 2>the Dow light when you're dry out of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>trees in some melodious plot of beach in</v>

<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for drafting vintage that has been </v>

10
00:00:50.951 --> 00:00:55.951
<v Speaker 2>cooled along age and the deep delving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Earth tasting of flora in the country.</v>

11
00:00:56.441 --> 00:00:57.970
<v Speaker 2>Green,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dense and prevent style,</v>

12
00:00:57.971 --> 00:01:01.020
<v Speaker 2>song and sunburnt mirth.</v>

<v Speaker 2>the blush,</v>

15
00:01:04.631 --> 00:01:05.464
<v Speaker 2>full hypocretin with beaded bubbles </v>
<v Speaker 2>winking at the brim and purples stated </v>

16
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.040
<v Speaker 2>mouth that I might drink and leave the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world unseen and with the fade away into</v>

17
00:01:17.471 --> 00:01:18.304
<v Speaker 2>the forest and fade faraway dissolve and</v>
<v Speaker 2>quite forget what thou among the leads </v>

<v Speaker 2>the fever,</v>

19
00:01:29.591 --> 00:01:32.260
<v Speaker 2>and the fret here where men sit and hear</v>
<v Speaker 2>each other grown.</v>

20
00:01:32.261 --> 00:01:33.094
<v Speaker 2>We're posey shakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A few sad last gray hair is where youth </v>

21
00:01:37.151 --> 00:01:37.984
<v Speaker 2>grows pale and specter thin and dyes </v>
<v Speaker 2>were but to think is to be full of </v>

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:49.573
<v Speaker 2>sorrows and let denied despairs where </v>
<v Speaker 2>beauty cannot keep her less resize or </v>

23

<v Speaker 2>new love pine at them beyond tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>away away for I will fly with the nut </v>

24
00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.860
<v Speaker 2>charioted by back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sent his parts,</v>

25
00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.903
<v Speaker 2>but on the swings of Posey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>though the Dole brain perplexes and </v>

26
00:02:09.851 --> 00:02:10.684
<v Speaker 2>retards already with the tender is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>night and happily the queen moon is on </v>

27
00:02:14.711 --> 00:02:17.650
<v Speaker 2>her throne,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clustered around by all her story phase,</v>

28
00:02:17.651 --> 00:02:22.651
<v Speaker 2>but here there is no light.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say what?</v>

29
00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:25.743
<v Speaker 2>From heaviness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the reasons blown through virtuous </v>

30
00:02:26.981 --> 00:02:28.540
<v Speaker 2>glooms and winding Masi ways,</v>

31
00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.670
<v Speaker 2>I cannot see what flowers are at my </v>
<v Speaker 2>feet,</v>

32
00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.820
<v Speaker 2>nor what soft incense hangs upon the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bowels,</v>

33
00:02:39.821 --> 00:02:40.654
<v Speaker 2>but in embalmment darkness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guests each suite where with the </v>

34
00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:45.880
<v Speaker 2>seasonable month endows the grass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thicket,</v>

35
00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:47.103
<v Speaker 2>and the fruit tree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wild white Hawthorne in the pastoral </v>

36
00:02:48.611 --> 00:02:50.200
<v Speaker 2>Eggland time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fast fading,</v>

37
00:02:50.201 --> 00:02:53.080
<v Speaker 2>Violet's covered up and leaves and mid </v>
<v Speaker 2>maze.</v>

38
00:02:53.081 --> 00:02:56.650
<v Speaker 2>Eldest child,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the coming must gross full of do we wind</v>

39
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.470
<v Speaker 2>murmurs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>haunt flies on summaries.</v>

40
00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.140
<v Speaker 1>Darkling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I listened for many a time.</v>

41
00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.210
<v Speaker 1>I have been half in love with easeful </v>
<v Speaker 1>death</v>

42
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.760
<v Speaker 2>called him names and many amused Ryan to</v>
<v Speaker 2>take into the air.</v>

43
00:03:27.731 --> 00:03:28.564
<v Speaker 2>My quiet breath now more than ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seems it rich today to cease upon the </v>

44
00:03:33.161 --> 00:03:33.994
<v Speaker 2>midnight with no pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that are pouring for thei soul </v>

45
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:39.063
<v Speaker 2>abroad in such an ecstasy still would've</v>
<v Speaker 2>stopped soon and I had ears in vain to </v>

46
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.200
<v Speaker 2>high requiem become a site that was not </v>
<v Speaker 2>born for death.</v>

47
00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.580
<v Speaker 2>Mortal Bird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no hung regenerations tread the down.</v>

48
00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.650
<v Speaker 2>The same voice I hear this passing night</v>
<v Speaker 2>was heard in ancient days by emperor and</v>

49
00:04:03.651 --> 00:04:04.484
<v Speaker 2>clown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>perhaps the self same song that found a </v>

50
00:04:05.931 --> 00:04:08.600
<v Speaker 2>path through the sad part of ruth when </v>
<v Speaker 2>sick for home.</v>

51
00:04:08.601 --> 00:04:13.601
<v Speaker 2>She stood in tears amid the alien core </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the same that oftentimes have charmed</v>

52
00:04:13.671 --> 00:04:18.671
<v Speaker 2>magic casements opening on the foam of </v>
<v Speaker 2>perilous seas in fairy lands for Lauren.</v>

53
00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:35.110
<v Speaker 2>Very word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like a bell to tow me back from the</v>

54
00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:37.450
<v Speaker 2>to my soul self.</v>

55
00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:40.043
<v Speaker 1>Do you</v>

56
00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.390
<v Speaker 2>the fancy cannot cheat so well as she </v>
<v Speaker 2>has failed to do deceiving.</v>

57
00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.880
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you?</v>

58
00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.290
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you buy plaintiff?</v>

59
00:04:48.291 --> 00:04:51.320
<v Speaker 2>Anthem fades past the near meadows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>over the stream,</v>

60
00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:52.243
<v Speaker 2>up the hillside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now is buried deep in the next </v>

61
00:04:54.951 --> 00:04:55.784
<v Speaker 2>valley glade.</v>

62
00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:02.663
<v Speaker 1>Was it division</v>

63
00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:10.190
<v Speaker 2>or a waking dream?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Flood.</v>

64
00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:12.153
<v Speaker 2>Is that music?</v>

65
00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.600
<v Speaker 1>Do I wake or sleep.</v>
