00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:03.560
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk about liberal policies.</v>

2
00:00:03.561 --> 00:00:05.840
<v Speaker 1>We have six years of them under </v>
<v Speaker 1>President Obama.</v>

3
00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.900
<v Speaker 1>Let's put aside obamacare because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>still undefined.</v>

4
00:00:08.901 --> 00:00:12.320
<v Speaker 1>Whether that's going to really help the </v>
<v Speaker 1>majority of people and put us out of the</v>

5
00:00:12.321 --> 00:00:14.540
<v Speaker 1>economy because some people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefiting now,</v>

6
00:00:14.541 --> 00:00:15.374
<v Speaker 1>but the wages are still down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the biggest accomplishment of </v>

7
00:00:20.631 --> 00:00:22.820
<v Speaker 1>President Obama domestically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your opinion?</v>

8
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:23.773
<v Speaker 1>I think financial reform.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think he's leading president </v>

9
00:00:25.491 --> 00:00:28.490
<v Speaker 1>Obama's a world leader?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think Putin is fearful of him?</v>

10
00:00:28.491 --> 00:00:31.450
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that that our problems over</v>
<v Speaker 1>the years.</v>

11
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.280
<v Speaker 1>One of the seven questions you just </v>
<v Speaker 1>asked me this hope so.</v>

12
00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:35.173
<v Speaker 1>It's an overall arch that President </v>
<v Speaker 1>Obama's leadership has caused a lot of </v>

13
00:00:38.571 --> 00:00:39.404
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of the problem is that we have the </v>

14
00:00:40.341 --> 00:00:43.720
<v Speaker 1>European nation who backed down because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they think America again.</v>

15
00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.520
<v Speaker 1>One thing though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were right.</v>

16
00:00:46.521 --> 00:00:48.590
<v Speaker 1>Would you just say that again?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

17
00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:49.850
<v Speaker 1>I would say you were right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

18
00:00:49.851 --> 00:00:51.050
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Barney frank,</v>

19
00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:52.580
<v Speaker 1>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got to get out of here right now.</v>
