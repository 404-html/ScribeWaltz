1
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.390
<v Speaker 1>Flavor that I didn't find any other </v>
<v Speaker 1>grand.</v>

2
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.060
<v Speaker 1>Try Camels and see</v>

3
00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.250
<v Speaker 2>and point at the first men came to </v>
<v Speaker 2>western.</v>

4
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.250
<v Speaker 2>Mine had this invention where he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually almost.</v>

5
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.870
<v Speaker 2>It was like mythical or something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but anyway,</v>

6
00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:38.704
<v Speaker 2>it was this chamber under ground where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you could go and hear everything that </v>

7
00:00:42.731 --> 00:00:45.490
<v Speaker 2>anyone had ever said about you behind </v>
<v Speaker 2>your back,</v>

8
00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:46.383
<v Speaker 2>but in order to get to the best thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>which was at the like the lower most </v>

9
00:00:49.841 --> 00:00:54.280
<v Speaker 2>chamber,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had to start at the worst insult and</v>

10
00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:55.143
<v Speaker 2>work your way down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My friend always used to say he could </v>

11
00:00:58.421 --> 00:01:00.730
<v Speaker 2>never make it two steps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know.</v>

12
00:01:00.731 --> 00:01:01.564
<v Speaker 2>I think I could make it to the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's because I have a poor </v>

13
00:01:04.541 --> 00:01:06.970
<v Speaker 2>imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you guys have.</v>

14
00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.760
<v Speaker 2>It is simply not pleasant to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>objectively observed.</v>

15
00:01:18.761 --> 00:01:21.490
<v Speaker 2>It's like seeing a candid photo of </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself online,</v>

16
00:01:21.491 --> 00:01:22.324
<v Speaker 2>not smiling or posing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but simply looking the way you will </v>

17
00:01:24.491 --> 00:01:28.510
<v Speaker 2>apparently always do oblivious and Bush </v>
<v Speaker 2>face with your mouth open.</v>

18
00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:29.553
<v Speaker 2>It's proof that we are visible to others</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we are seeing in all are naked </v>

19
00:01:33.071 --> 00:01:37.750
<v Speaker 2>silliness and stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A group of friends.</v>

20
00:01:37.751 --> 00:01:38.584
<v Speaker 2>I think it's inevitable you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>spend time talking with one another </v>

21
00:01:41.651 --> 00:01:42.484
<v Speaker 2>about one another behind one another's </v>
<v Speaker 2>backs and it's not always going to be </v>

22
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.760
<v Speaker 2>nice thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it can be healthy.</v>

23
00:01:48.761 --> 00:01:49.594
<v Speaker 2>Your friends are never going to be so </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfect that they don't act like an </v>

24
00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.650
<v Speaker 2>idiot sometimes or repeat their own </v>
<v Speaker 2>mistakes or do other things which are so</v>

25
00:01:56.651 --> 00:01:57.484
<v Speaker 2>clearly against their interests and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think it's healthy to vent to other </v>

26
00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.260
<v Speaker 2>mutual friends about how aggravating and</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy this person can be if for nothing,</v>

27
00:02:08.171 --> 00:02:12.280
<v Speaker 2>but to ensure that in this instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the crazy one isn't you.</v>

28
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.780
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>brands don't talk behind your back.</v>

29
00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.980
<v Speaker 3>So one thing is when people talk behind </v>
<v Speaker 3>your back,</v>

30
00:02:20.981 --> 00:02:22.630
<v Speaker 3>it really shows you what kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>friendly.</v>

31
00:02:22.631 --> 00:02:27.631
<v Speaker 3>Our first thing to remember is that if </v>
<v Speaker 3>anyone talks behind your back,</v>

32
00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.210
<v Speaker 3>they're probably doing because they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>jealous.</v>

33
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.903
<v Speaker 2>Other day at lunch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was part of a whole group of </v>

34
00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:36.733
<v Speaker 2>colleagues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>colleagues in my school and who were </v>

35
00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.800
<v Speaker 2>talking behind our bosses back.</v>

36
00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:42.760
<v Speaker 3>I mean like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seriously.</v>

37
00:02:42.761 --> 00:02:46.250
<v Speaker 3>It just is like isn't necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>

38
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:47.290
<v Speaker 3>It's not necessary.</v>

39
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.360
<v Speaker 2>We're talking behind someone's back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ken,</v>

40
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:16.203
<v Speaker 2>just be plain Shitty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when you're trying to gain </v>

41
00:03:18.521 --> 00:03:21.490
<v Speaker 2>the favor of one friend at the expense </v>
<v Speaker 2>of another,</v>

42
00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:22.383
<v Speaker 2>these purely negative gossip or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>kinds of talk that we should try our </v>

43
00:03:25.631 --> 00:03:28.800
<v Speaker 2>best to avoid and speak up against when </v>
<v Speaker 2>we hear it began.</v>

44
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:29.703
<v Speaker 2>As kreider says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the operative fallacy here is that we </v>

45
00:03:32.111 --> 00:03:32.944
<v Speaker 2>believe that unconditional love means </v>
<v Speaker 2>not seeing anything negative about </v>

46
00:03:36.821 --> 00:03:37.654
<v Speaker 2>someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but usually the fact that friends talk </v>

47
00:03:39.161 --> 00:03:39.994
<v Speaker 2>behind other friends backs is precisely </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they have a stake in the </v>

48
00:03:44.141 --> 00:03:44.974
<v Speaker 2>friendship and spend a lot of time </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking about this person whom they </v>

49
00:03:48.311 --> 00:03:49.144
<v Speaker 2>love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Talking with friends about friends like </v>

50
00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.880
<v Speaker 2>talking with friends is the important </v>
<v Speaker 2>work of French.</v>

51
00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:55.743
<v Speaker 2>Just like telling a friend that you love</v>
<v Speaker 2>them is as important as telling another </v>

52
00:03:59.471 --> 00:04:02.020
<v Speaker 2>friend that you told your friend that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you love them.</v>

53
00:04:02.021 --> 00:04:06.280
<v Speaker 2>So much of what we tell others is what </v>
<v Speaker 2>we want for ourselves.</v>

54
00:04:06.281 --> 00:04:09.310
<v Speaker 2>Does it have to be as circuitous as </v>
<v Speaker 2>this?</v>

55
00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:14.800
<v Speaker 2>Thank you so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

56
00:04:14.801 --> 00:04:18.300
<v Speaker 2>This is great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

57
00:04:18.301 --> 00:04:20.970
<v Speaker 2>that friend who his name is Jake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just a friend of mine.</v>

58
00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:24.030
<v Speaker 2>He's a great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Learn your instruments.</v>

59
00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.640
<v Speaker 4>You want me to dance as well?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a beautiful dance for them.</v>

60
00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.630
<v Speaker 4>For the electric guitar lesson.</v>
