1
00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:03.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm not really a big fan of John </v>
<v Speaker 1>luchador anymore.</v>

2
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.470
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to be disrespectful.</v>

3
00:00:05.471 --> 00:00:06.304
<v Speaker 1>I just think I've outgrown him because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was so influential to me that the </v>

4
00:00:08.471 --> 00:00:09.304
<v Speaker 1>beginning of my aesthetic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a director of like wanting to be a </v>

5
00:00:12.401 --> 00:00:13.234
<v Speaker 1>director.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's kind of like lack of complete any </v>

6
00:00:15.431 --> 00:00:16.264
<v Speaker 1>type of film style.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just this wanting to make movies for </v>

7
00:00:18.581 --> 00:00:19.414
<v Speaker 1>love of it is the one who taught me the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fun and the freedom and the joy of of </v>

8
00:00:24.761 --> 00:00:27.940
<v Speaker 1>breaking rules just fucking around with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the entire medium.</v>

9
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.040
<v Speaker 2>Like many other things in our modern </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

10
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:39.323
<v Speaker 2>The course of film history was changed </v>
<v Speaker 2>forever by the Second World War that </v>

11
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.893
<v Speaker 2>despite having grown out of him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Quentin Tarantino's self-conscious </v>

12
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.013
<v Speaker 2>postmodern aesthetic is a direct </v>
<v Speaker 2>descendant of the self conscious </v>

13
00:00:52.051 --> 00:00:57.051
<v Speaker 2>postmodern work of John Luca Dart and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the French new wave of which Godard is a</v>

14
00:00:57.211 --> 00:00:58.044
<v Speaker 2>pioneer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>emerges and is a response to the </v>

15
00:01:00.331 --> 00:01:03.910
<v Speaker 2>circumstances arising out of the end of </v>
<v Speaker 2>World War Two.</v>

16
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:06.960
<v Speaker 2>Let me explain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A year after the end of the war,</v>

17
00:01:06.961 --> 00:01:09.720
<v Speaker 2>after the liberation of France from Nazi</v>
<v Speaker 2>control,</v>

18
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:10.673
<v Speaker 2>French Prime Minister Leon blue traveled</v>
<v Speaker 2>to Washington DC to meet with Secretary </v>

19
00:01:14.731 --> 00:01:15.564
<v Speaker 2>of state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>James Burns can negotiate an agreement </v>

20
00:01:17.611 --> 00:01:20.690
<v Speaker 2>that would cancel Francis $2,000,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>ward.</v>

21
00:01:20.691 --> 00:01:21.524
<v Speaker 2>They're the result of the bloom burns </v>
<v Speaker 2>agreement was the almost complete </v>

22
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.740
<v Speaker 2>opening of French markets to American </v>
<v Speaker 2>cultural products,</v>

23
00:01:28.741 --> 00:01:31.650
<v Speaker 2>particularly films before this </v>
<v Speaker 2>agreement,</v>

24
00:01:31.651 --> 00:01:32.484
<v Speaker 2>France had imposed quotas on the number </v>
<v Speaker 2>of American films allowed to play in </v>

25
00:01:36.121 --> 00:01:40.860
<v Speaker 2>French theaters as a way to preserve the</v>
<v Speaker 2>unique identity of French cinema.</v>

26
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.920
<v Speaker 2>The Bloomberg's agreement decimated </v>
<v Speaker 2>those quarters,</v>

27
00:01:43.921 --> 00:01:44.754
<v Speaker 2>resulting in the free market domination </v>
<v Speaker 2>of American Hollywood movies in France </v>

28
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:50.093
<v Speaker 2>into this universe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The founding members of the French new </v>

29
00:01:52.681 --> 00:01:53.514
<v Speaker 2>wave grew up in the pages of Du Cinema.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They advanced a new form of film theory </v>

30
00:01:58.441 --> 00:01:59.274
<v Speaker 2>criticizing many of their French </v>
<v Speaker 2>forefathers and praising the work of </v>

31
00:02:02.281 --> 00:02:04.830
<v Speaker 2>Hollywood studio directors like Alfred </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hitchcock,</v>

32
00:02:04.831 --> 00:02:05.664
<v Speaker 2>Orson Welles and John finished that job </v>
<v Speaker 2>awash in hundreds of Hollywood movies </v>

33
00:02:10.981 --> 00:02:11.814
<v Speaker 2>and in depth analysis of American art </v>
<v Speaker 2>tourers Gianluca Dart makes breathless </v>

34
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.690
<v Speaker 2>from a story treatment by new wave </v>
<v Speaker 2>compatriots,</v>

35
00:02:18.691 --> 00:02:19.524
<v Speaker 2>Francois Truffaut and Claude chabrol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Breathless is an extended investigation </v>

36
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:25.103
<v Speaker 2>of a French filmmaker identity in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>shadow of Hollywood dominance of indeed </v>

37
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.990
<v Speaker 2>whether an identity informed by another </v>
<v Speaker 2>nation's culture can exist at all.</v>

38
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.840
<v Speaker 2>Breathless tells the story of small time</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crook,</v>

39
00:02:36.841 --> 00:02:37.674
<v Speaker 2>Michelle in the aftermath of his murder </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a police officer on his way to see </v>

40
00:02:41.191 --> 00:02:44.100
<v Speaker 2>his American lover,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Patricia in Paris.</v>

41
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.203
<v Speaker 2>Michel models his personality on </v>
<v Speaker 2>Humphrey Bogart just as the film models </v>

42
00:02:49.081 --> 00:02:53.370
<v Speaker 2>itself on the Hollywood crime thriller,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in both cases,</v>

43
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.000
<v Speaker 2>these identifications are continually </v>
<v Speaker 2>frustrated.</v>

44
00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:58.223
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take a look at the films inciting </v>

45
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.933
<v Speaker 2>incident.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The film opens with Michelle dressed </v>

46
00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:03.583
<v Speaker 2>like a parody of an American gangster </v>
<v Speaker 2>mimicking a gesture attributed to folk </v>

47
00:03:07.631 --> 00:03:08.464
<v Speaker 2>art.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He then steals and American oldsmobile </v>

48
00:03:10.331 --> 00:03:11.164
<v Speaker 2>from an American military officer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which almost immediately furnishes him </v>

49
00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.080
<v Speaker 2>with an implement to make his identity </v>
<v Speaker 2>complete.</v>

50
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.150
<v Speaker 2>A revolver.</v>
<v Speaker 2>After running a light,</v>

51
00:03:19.151 --> 00:03:21.820
<v Speaker 2>Michelle is chased by two motorcycle </v>
<v Speaker 2>cops.</v>

52
00:03:21.821 --> 00:03:22.654
<v Speaker 2>One eventually tracks him down and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>shootout and sues the classic dramatic </v>

53
00:03:26.141 --> 00:03:27.970
<v Speaker 2>moment of the film,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the war,</v>

54
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.200
<v Speaker 2>but look at the sequence of shots in </v>
<v Speaker 2>which this shootout I'm full.</v>

55
00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.780
<v Speaker 2>The whole scene plays like a misfire of </v>
<v Speaker 2>these kinds of moments.</v>

56
00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:51.890
<v Speaker 2>Not only does a murderer seemed totally </v>
<v Speaker 2>unmotivated for the crime committed,</v>

57
00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.170
<v Speaker 2>but we don't even get to see the cops </v>
<v Speaker 2>face.</v>

58
00:03:54.171 --> 00:03:55.004
<v Speaker 2>The shootout takes place over only five </v>
<v Speaker 2>shots in 10 seconds with imagery and </v>

59
00:03:58.371 --> 00:03:59.204
<v Speaker 2>sound effects out of sync,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the camera impulsively favors </v>

60
00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:02.443
<v Speaker 2>extreme closeups that obscure the action</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of wide shots that would have </v>

61
00:04:05.691 --> 00:04:10.160
<v Speaker 2>made everything clear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything in the sequence serves to rob</v>

62
00:04:10.161 --> 00:04:12.830
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shell of his part in the confrontation.</v>

63
00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.040
<v Speaker 2>The film itself intervenes to strip the </v>
<v Speaker 2>scene down to bare formulaic elements.</v>

64
00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:19.513
<v Speaker 2>In this way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the film is always watching over </v>

65
00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:22.753
<v Speaker 2>Michelle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making comments on his immature desire </v>

66
00:04:24.861 --> 00:04:25.694
<v Speaker 2>to become bogart or actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>interjecting itself to upset that </v>

67
00:04:28.911 --> 00:04:30.290
<v Speaker 2>desire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Later,</v>

68
00:04:30.291 --> 00:04:31.124
<v Speaker 2>Michelle confronts a poster of his hero,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a giant image of Bogart from his very </v>

69
00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.770
<v Speaker 2>last movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The harder they fall,</v>

70
00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:41.120
<v Speaker 2>you can see Michelle's Pale reflection </v>
<v Speaker 2>being dwarfed by his hero,</v>

71
00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.700
<v Speaker 2>and then you have a face off between the</v>
<v Speaker 2>two men,</v>

72
00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.780
<v Speaker 2>both totally stone faced and unreadable </v>
<v Speaker 2>seconds later,</v>

73
00:04:47.781 --> 00:04:52.010
<v Speaker 2>the film loudly announces itself by </v>
<v Speaker 2>ending the scene with a wacky,</v>

74
00:04:52.011 --> 00:04:54.070
<v Speaker 2>awkward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>outmoded Iris.</v>

75
00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.420
<v Speaker 2>What's being called to attention here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

76
00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.450
<v Speaker 2>I think the late film critic Dennis </v>
<v Speaker 2>Turner gives us a hint when he cites the</v>

77
00:05:02.451 --> 00:05:05.000
<v Speaker 2>French psychoanalyst,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jacques Lacan seat,</v>

78
00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.853
<v Speaker 2>Louis Kahn's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most famous contribution to our </v>

79
00:05:07.431 --> 00:05:11.960
<v Speaker 2>understanding of human development is </v>
<v Speaker 2>something called the mirror stage.</v>

80
00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.823
<v Speaker 2>It describes the moment when a baby </v>
<v Speaker 2>first sees itself in the mirror is that </v>

81
00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:17.613
<v Speaker 2>little girl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you too young to have any control yet </v>

82
00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:22.543
<v Speaker 2>over itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The infant recognizes a unity in its </v>

83
00:05:25.671 --> 00:05:26.504
<v Speaker 2>mirror version and aspires to that unity</v>
<v Speaker 2>projecting itself into the place of the </v>

84
00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.113
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This means that the very formation of </v>

85
00:05:34.311 --> 00:05:35.144
<v Speaker 2>ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first time we perceive ourselves as </v>

86
00:05:37.281 --> 00:05:40.610
<v Speaker 2>a subject,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we perceive is not really us.</v>

87
00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:44.660
<v Speaker 2>It's an imaginary projection of us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For this reason,</v>

88
00:05:44.661 --> 00:05:47.930
<v Speaker 2>the human subjects says Lacan is always </v>
<v Speaker 2>divided.</v>

89
00:05:47.931 --> 00:05:48.764
<v Speaker 2>It's never really hold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Michelle is someone consumed by his </v>

90
00:05:52.371 --> 00:05:53.204
<v Speaker 2>identification looking at bogart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't recognize the impossibility </v>

91
00:05:56.781 --> 00:06:01.250
<v Speaker 2>of his hero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just stares intently forward and it's</v>

92
00:06:01.251 --> 00:06:02.084
<v Speaker 2>left to the film and it's anachronistic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fade out to inform us that it knows </v>

93
00:06:06.591 --> 00:06:07.424
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Michelle's immaturity is matched by his </v>

94
00:06:12.341 --> 00:06:13.930
<v Speaker 2>love interests,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Patricia,</v>

95
00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:17.910
<v Speaker 2>that long famous scene that sits at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>heart of this movie with Michelle.</v>

96
00:06:17.911 --> 00:06:18.744
<v Speaker 2>Hold up in Patricia's bedroom is </v>
<v Speaker 2>proceeded by a long look in the mirror </v>

97
00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:27.220
<v Speaker 2>by Patricia and it features mirrors all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way through and images of lovers and</v>

98
00:06:27.221 --> 00:06:28.054
<v Speaker 2>other men and women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both characters are lost in search of a </v>

99
00:06:31.421 --> 00:06:34.990
<v Speaker 2>solid identity that might be reflected </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the other.</v>

100
00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.470
<v Speaker 2>There are back and forth is a constant </v>
<v Speaker 2>oblique,</v>

101
00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.700
<v Speaker 2>probing into the other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hoping to mind some reaction,</v>

102
00:06:40.701 --> 00:06:43.420
<v Speaker 2>some statement that might explain </v>
<v Speaker 2>finally</v>

103
00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:44.613
<v Speaker 3>who they are.</v>

104
00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.193
<v Speaker 2>At the end of the film,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Michelle finally gets everything he </v>

105
00:06:52.571 --> 00:06:53.404
<v Speaker 2>needs to escape,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but after Patricia betrays him to the </v>

106
00:06:56.201 --> 00:06:59.440
<v Speaker 2>police,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his imaginary identification with Bogart</v>

107
00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:00.693
<v Speaker 2>is finally broke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The tragedy is that the film still </v>

108
00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:09.120
<v Speaker 2>forces him along the tracks of the genre</v>
<v Speaker 2>inside which he's trapped.</v>

109
00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:13.570
<v Speaker 2>The cops bumbling like silly parodies of</v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves all throughout the film still</v>

110
00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:18.600
<v Speaker 2>nonetheless gunned him down breathless </v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's hero oscillates.</v>

111
00:07:19.361 --> 00:07:23.470
<v Speaker 2>Between these two registers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wants to participate in the Hollywood</v>

112
00:07:23.471 --> 00:07:27.520
<v Speaker 2>filmmaking it admires,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it knows that such an identification</v>

113
00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:28.383
<v Speaker 2>is impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it deals with this by being self </v>

114
00:07:31.161 --> 00:07:33.070
<v Speaker 2>conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by using jump cuts,</v>

115
00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:33.933
<v Speaker 2>awkward transitions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by robbing the classic moments of their </v>

116
00:07:35.981 --> 00:07:36.814
<v Speaker 2>force or making the heroes bloody final </v>
<v Speaker 2>steps way longer than it could ever </v>

117
00:07:40.421 --> 00:07:43.540
<v Speaker 2>possibly be forcing you outside of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>films,</v>

118
00:07:43.541 --> 00:07:45.820
<v Speaker 2>text or back into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

119
00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:50.410
<v Speaker 2>depending on how you look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's no surprise that the effects of war</v>

120
00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:55.030
<v Speaker 2>are fast and unexpected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>America flooded France with its films,</v>

121
00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:55.893
<v Speaker 2>onto which the new wave filmmakers </v>
<v Speaker 2>projected a superiority that they </v>

122
00:07:59.981 --> 00:08:03.400
<v Speaker 2>created by then identifying with it in </v>
<v Speaker 2>their movies.</v>

123
00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:04.563
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>American economic dominance created an </v>

124
00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:07.743
<v Speaker 2>ideological dominance in the minds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>dominated for the only way to deal with </v>

125
00:08:12.611 --> 00:08:17.611
<v Speaker 2>this was to be conscious of the dynamic </v>
<v Speaker 2>unfixed nature of these identities.</v>

126
00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:18.993
<v Speaker 2>Indeed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the only way that we can deal with </v>

127
00:08:20.951 --> 00:08:24.430
<v Speaker 2>the dynamic unfixed nature of our own </v>
<v Speaker 2>identities.</v>

128
00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:29.800
<v Speaker 2>The unexpected thing is how influential </v>
<v Speaker 2>that consciousness was</v>

129
00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:34.020
<v Speaker 3>when it eventually came back across the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Atlantic.</v>

130
00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:39.640
<v Speaker 4>Hey everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>buddy,</v>

134
00:08:46.481 --> 00:08:48.400

<v Speaker 3>thought,</v>

135
00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:52.450

138
00:08:58.020 --> 00:08:58.853

<v Speaker 3>you to keep pledging just because you </v>

139
00:09:01.261 --> 00:09:03.030
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what makes this channel possible.</v>

140
00:09:03.031 --> 00:09:04.460
<v Speaker 3>My patriotic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

141
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:08.970
<v Speaker 3>these videos take like 50 hours to make.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it is a full time job,</v>

142
00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:11.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>legitimately,</v>

<v Speaker 3>in the quality of the content.</v>
