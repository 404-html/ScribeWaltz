1
00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:05.690
<v Speaker 1>I think it's worth talking a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>about Rosetta scientists,</v>

2
00:00:05.691 --> 00:00:07.340
<v Speaker 1>Matt Taylor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now infamous.</v>

3
00:00:07.341 --> 00:00:08.174
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sort of what we do here at the nerd </v>

4
00:00:09.281 --> 00:00:11.090
<v Speaker 1>writer talk about morality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things like that,</v>

5
00:00:11.091 --> 00:00:11.924
<v Speaker 1>but if you think you've heard everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>you ever want to hear about this </v>

6
00:00:14.391 --> 00:00:16.550
<v Speaker 1>subject,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you a chance to get out now.</v>

7
00:00:16.551 --> 00:00:19.460
<v Speaker 1>Here's an awesome video of a dog trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get a tater tot.</v>

8
00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:20.623
<v Speaker 1>I'll see you some other time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the sand pepper thing happened a </v>

9
00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:24.403
<v Speaker 1>few weeks ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was drawn to look at it from an </v>

10
00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.353
<v Speaker 1>anthropological perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>though I wholeheartedly agreed with the </v>

11
00:00:28.911 --> 00:00:29.744
<v Speaker 1>criticism of pepper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the form and impact of the </v>

12
00:00:32.781 --> 00:00:36.560
<v Speaker 1>response that fascinated me most in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wake of shirk gate.</v>

13
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.310
<v Speaker 1>I just found myself wanting to know who </v>
<v Speaker 1>was right and why.</v>

14
00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:41.173
<v Speaker 1>This is an important exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think because it took all of three </v>

15
00:00:43.251 --> 00:00:44.084
<v Speaker 1>Internet seconds for arguments about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this to devolve into Straw man attacks </v>

16
00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:48.470
<v Speaker 1>and character assassinations.</v>

17
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.650
<v Speaker 1>Soon as is so often the case in public </v>
<v Speaker 1>discourse,</v>

18
00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.770
<v Speaker 1>everybody loses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people who were criticizing Taylor's</v>

19
00:00:54.771 --> 00:00:55.604
<v Speaker 1>choice of shirt said essentially that </v>
<v Speaker 1>images like these conserve to dissuade </v>

20
00:00:59.331 --> 00:01:02.270
<v Speaker 1>girls who might otherwise go into stem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>

21
00:01:02.271 --> 00:01:03.200
<v Speaker 1>technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>engineering,</v>

22
00:01:03.201 --> 00:01:07.010
<v Speaker 1>and math fields,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because images like these perpetuate the</v>

23
00:01:07.011 --> 00:01:10.160
<v Speaker 1>cultural stereotype that stem is a boys </v>
<v Speaker 1>club,</v>

24
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:11.083
<v Speaker 1>just not something that girls do or as </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mike over at idea channel set on his </v>

25
00:01:15.231 --> 00:01:16.064
<v Speaker 1>tumbler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The shirt was like the coloring on a </v>

26
00:01:17.391 --> 00:01:19.070
<v Speaker 1>poisonous frog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's screams.</v>

27
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.083
<v Speaker 1>Stay away to some maybe lots of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly when Mike wrote about this </v>

28
00:01:24.801 --> 00:01:26.630
<v Speaker 1>in response to a tumbler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ask that said,</v>

29
00:01:26.631 --> 00:01:27.464
<v Speaker 1>simply kill yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not the most articulate way to advance </v>

30
00:01:30.711 --> 00:01:31.544
<v Speaker 1>your argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but of course hate is a huge part of </v>

31
00:01:33.981 --> 00:01:37.340
<v Speaker 1>controversies like these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only for those who speak out against</v>

32
00:01:37.341 --> 00:01:38.174
<v Speaker 1>perceived wrongs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even those who support those who </v>

33
00:01:40.941 --> 00:01:41.360
<v Speaker 1>speak out.</v>

34
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.193
<v Speaker 1>On the slightly more articulate side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have commentators like the mayor of </v>

35
00:01:45.471 --> 00:01:46.304
<v Speaker 1>London,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boris Johnson who said there must be </v>

36
00:01:48.021 --> 00:01:48.854
<v Speaker 1>room in our world for centricity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if it offends the prudes and room </v>

37
00:01:53.091 --> 00:01:56.930
<v Speaker 1>for the vague other worldliness that </v>
<v Speaker 1>often goes with genius,</v>

38
00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.710
<v Speaker 1>and then you have women across social </v>
<v Speaker 1>media who said they weren't in the least</v>

39
00:02:00.711 --> 00:02:04.130
<v Speaker 1>bit offended by tailored shirt and after</v>
<v Speaker 1>all it's just a shirt,</v>

40
00:02:04.131 --> 00:02:04.941
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Movies,</v>

41
00:02:04.941 --> 00:02:06.110
<v Speaker 1>TV,</v>
<v Speaker 1>magazines,</v>

42
00:02:06.111 --> 00:02:10.130
<v Speaker 1>billboards are filled with exploitative </v>
<v Speaker 1>images of female sexuality.</v>

43
00:02:10.131 --> 00:02:10.964
<v Speaker 1>Help Kim Kardashians probably did more </v>
<v Speaker 1>to damage young girls image of </v>

44
00:02:13.521 --> 00:02:14.900
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the rest combined.</v>

45
00:02:14.901 --> 00:02:19.700
<v Speaker 1>Why are we crucifying Matt Taylor when </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone support something or other that</v>

46
00:02:19.701 --> 00:02:24.140
<v Speaker 1>has some kind of misogynistic undertone </v>
<v Speaker 1>when none of us are blameless.</v>

47
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.810
<v Speaker 1>First off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not crucifying Matt Taylor.</v>

48
00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:27.703
<v Speaker 1>We're trying to show how wearing a shirt</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that on a global webcast might add </v>

49
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.470
<v Speaker 1>to a culture of denigration of women.</v>

50
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:34.573
<v Speaker 1>Second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't really matter if some women </v>

51
00:02:36.141 --> 00:02:40.040
<v Speaker 1>aren't offended by Taylor shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What matters are facts,</v>

52
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.933
<v Speaker 1>statistics like these statistics that </v>
<v Speaker 1>show women earn 60 percent of all </v>

53
00:02:44.541 --> 00:02:48.880
<v Speaker 1>graduate degrees yet comprise less than </v>
<v Speaker 1>25 percent of the stem fields.</v>

54
00:02:48.881 --> 00:02:49.714
<v Speaker 1>Statistics that show women are far less </v>
<v Speaker 1>likely to be published in peer reviewed </v>

55
00:02:53.271 --> 00:02:57.530
<v Speaker 1>scientific journals and just is unlikely</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be cited when they are published.</v>

56
00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.060
<v Speaker 1>Maybe this is because women just like </v>
<v Speaker 1>science as much as men,</v>

57
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:02.860
<v Speaker 1>and if you're operating on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>assumption,</v>

58
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:03.723
<v Speaker 1>there's little I can tell you saved to </v>
<v Speaker 1>suggest that maybe your assumptions are </v>

59
00:03:07.061 --> 00:03:10.540
<v Speaker 1>following from cultural norms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so invisible.</v>

60
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.250
<v Speaker 1>They seem like insights about gender.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really the strongest emotion I'm feeling</v>

61
00:03:15.251 --> 00:03:18.790
<v Speaker 1>from the Internet in the wake of shirt </v>
<v Speaker 1>gate is annoyance.</v>

62
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:19.803
<v Speaker 1>Why do we have to cheapen this </v>
<v Speaker 1>miraculous achievement of science and </v>

63
00:03:22.021 --> 00:03:26.890
<v Speaker 1>humankind with petty bickering about one</v>
<v Speaker 1>man's stupid fashion choices,</v>

64
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.400
<v Speaker 1>and I think this gets to the beating </v>
<v Speaker 1>heart of the matter.</v>

65
00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.760
<v Speaker 1>The dirty secret about sexism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>racism,</v>

66
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.360
<v Speaker 1>homophobia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>prejudice is that it's pleasurable,</v>

67
00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.620
<v Speaker 1>it's pleasurable to assert your </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance within a hierarchy.</v>

68
00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.903
<v Speaker 1>You create splittable in the same way </v>
<v Speaker 1>that winning at a sporting event is </v>

69
00:03:45.791 --> 00:03:46.624
<v Speaker 1>pleasurable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The feeling of being a winner of </v>

70
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.370
<v Speaker 1>bettering someone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when we think about issues like this,</v>

71
00:03:51.371 --> 00:03:55.450
<v Speaker 1>we have to keep in mind that what we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about is people's pleasure about</v>

72
00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.060
<v Speaker 1>taking it away from them rightly so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yet,</v>

73
00:03:58.061 --> 00:04:01.210
<v Speaker 1>it will come as no surprise that there </v>
<v Speaker 1>is reluctant to let it go here,</v>

74
00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.480
<v Speaker 1>as in any other instance of </v>
<v Speaker 1>gratification in the active sense,</v>

75
00:04:04.481 --> 00:04:07.540
<v Speaker 1>prejudice is easy to condemn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the passive sense,</v>

76
00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:08.403
<v Speaker 1>it's far more insidious to tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise kind and good hearted people </v>

77
00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.490
<v Speaker 1>that by doing nothing at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're perpetuating bigotry,</v>

78
00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:16.473
<v Speaker 1>discrimination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intolerance to require them to think </v>

79
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.500
<v Speaker 1>about their actions and inactions may </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel incredibly annoying.</v>

80
00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.290
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is to take someone's </v>
<v Speaker 1>pleasure away,</v>

81
00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.440
<v Speaker 1>pleasure that's so normalized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so baked into our lives.</v>

82
00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.890
<v Speaker 1>It's removal feels a lot like paint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I for one,</v>

83
00:04:32.891 --> 00:04:37.000
<v Speaker 1>think it's possible to hold two lines of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought in the mind at once to marvel at</v>

84
00:04:37.001 --> 00:04:37.834
<v Speaker 1>the unbelievable magic of the Rosetta </v>
<v Speaker 1>mission and to lament the real </v>

85
00:04:41.171 --> 00:04:42.004
<v Speaker 1>contribution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However small of one man's shirt on a </v>

86
00:04:44.381 --> 00:04:45.214
<v Speaker 1>community of women who began at a loss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the next time you feel annoyed at </v>

87
00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.320
<v Speaker 1>feminists or social justice warriors </v>
<v Speaker 1>were Mike from idea channel.</v>

88
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:58.830
<v Speaker 1>Take 60 seconds to think about whether </v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact you feel annoyed or threatened.</v>

89
00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.330
<v Speaker 1>If it's the latter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ask yourself,</v>

90
00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:07.200
<v Speaker 1>what is it that I'm in danger of losing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey everybody.</v>

91
00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.410
<v Speaker 1>As I said at the beginning of the video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is sort of what we do here.</v>

92
00:05:11.411 --> 00:05:15.670
<v Speaker 1>We think about moral issues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to figure out what side we come out,</v>

93
00:05:15.671 --> 00:05:16.504
<v Speaker 1>and if we can't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just try to get a better </v>

94
00:05:18.491 --> 00:05:20.770
<v Speaker 1>understanding of what the issue actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

95
00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:24.460
<v Speaker 1>So thanks for watching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make sure to follow me on twitter if you</v>

96
00:05:24.461 --> 00:05:25.294
<v Speaker 1>haven't already,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll leave the link in the description </v>

97
00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.510
<v Speaker 1>and I will see you next time.</v>
