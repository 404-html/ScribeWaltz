1
00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:07.750
<v Speaker 1>I didn't get a tear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You lift sap.</v>

2
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm gonna do,</v>

3
00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:16.263
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna tear your eyes</v>

4
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.460
<v Speaker 2>out of the socket.</v>

5
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna hit you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're gonna fall,</v>

6
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:31.853
<v Speaker 2>so this is a scene that came out of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>nineties television show for children </v>

7
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.600
<v Speaker 2>that may be hard to believe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then again,</v>

8
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:40.583
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the scenes that came out of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ren and stimpy show pretty hard to </v>

9
00:00:43.561 --> 00:00:45.780
<v Speaker 2>believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a child of the nineties and no,</v>

10
00:00:45.781 --> 00:00:46.614
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen many of the episodes of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this show for well over a decade on </v>

11
00:00:49.921 --> 00:00:50.754
<v Speaker 2>rewatching the series.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was amazed by how much of the imagery </v>

12
00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.023
<v Speaker 2>was lodged deep in my memory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the walls of tiers that welled up </v>

13
00:00:58.261 --> 00:00:59.094
<v Speaker 2>and were ejected out of stimpy's eyes in</v>
<v Speaker 2>this episode called the little giant or </v>

14
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.300
<v Speaker 2>the nerve endings that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>excrutiatingly plucked out of Rennes gum</v>

15
00:01:07.301 --> 00:01:08.134
<v Speaker 2>sockets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course every gruesome yet </v>

16
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.913
<v Speaker 2>painterly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>extreme closeup that became a staple of </v>

17
00:01:13.411 --> 00:01:17.070
<v Speaker 2>the show and a few that followed along </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the simpsons.</v>

18
00:01:17.071 --> 00:01:22.071
<v Speaker 2>Ren and stimpy was a seminal cartoon of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the animation renaissance that hit TV in</v>

19
00:01:22.141 --> 00:01:23.280
<v Speaker 2>the early 19 nineties.</v>

20
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.540
<v Speaker 2>Whereas the simpsons was focused on </v>
<v Speaker 2>sharp satirical writing,</v>

21
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.270
<v Speaker 2>Ren and stimpy and its creator John </v>
<v Speaker 2>Crikey Volusia.</v>

22
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.690
<v Speaker 2>We're obsessed with unique,</v>
<v Speaker 2>detailed and highly,</v>

23
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.553
<v Speaker 2>very animation techniques.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this is why the imagery of Ren </v>

24
00:01:37.351 --> 00:01:39.630
<v Speaker 2>and stimpy really leaves a mark on your </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain.</v>

25
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:40.733
<v Speaker 2>Quick Volusia was coming from a </v>
<v Speaker 2>notorious starkey gene commercial </v>

26
00:01:43.111 --> 00:01:43.944
<v Speaker 2>animation in which the production of </v>
<v Speaker 2>shows was fragment in an outsourced </v>

27
00:01:47.641 --> 00:01:50.460
<v Speaker 2>overseas to places like Taiwan and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Philippines.</v>

28
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.730
<v Speaker 2>Plotlines were simple cliche and facial </v>
<v Speaker 2>expressions were relegated to happy,</v>

29
00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.640
<v Speaker 2>sad and confused,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's about it.</v>

30
00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.560
<v Speaker 2>There's a million versions of happy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sad and perplexed,</v>

31
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.230
<v Speaker 2>and then there's all these other kinds </v>
<v Speaker 2>of emotions that I've labeled,</v>

32
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.850
<v Speaker 2>but you can draw them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I urged my artists all the time to never</v>

33
00:02:08.851 --> 00:02:10.890
<v Speaker 2>draw an expression that they've drawn </v>
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>

34
00:02:10.891 --> 00:02:13.490
<v Speaker 2>So you're not allowed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Quickfire.</v>

35
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.353
<v Speaker 2>Lucy found his sensibility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>apprenticing and working cowork Ralph </v>

36
00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.973
<v Speaker 2>Bash in animation legend who was </v>
<v Speaker 2>producing some of the only interesting </v>

37
00:02:21.571 --> 00:02:23.340
<v Speaker 2>commercial work of the 19 seventies.</v>

38
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:24.503
<v Speaker 2>He married the surreal often disturbing </v>
<v Speaker 2>field bash key stuff with the dense </v>

39
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.700
<v Speaker 2>energetic style of Bob Clampett cartoons</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the 19 thirties and forties,</v>

40
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.260
<v Speaker 2>like Clampett,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quick flu seat.</v>

41
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.440
<v Speaker 2>Wanted Ren and snippy to be filled with </v>
<v Speaker 2>a new idea.</v>

42
00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:38.453
<v Speaker 2>Every second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just take a look at these handful of </v>

43
00:02:40.351 --> 00:02:43.140
<v Speaker 2>frames from what's probably the best </v>
<v Speaker 2>episode of the series,</v>

44
00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.870
<v Speaker 2>stimpy's invention,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every frame.</v>

45
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.360
<v Speaker 2>It's a completely new drawing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The scrip floozy once said of Clampett.</v>

46
00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.340
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't even look like it animates </v>
<v Speaker 2>yet in real time.</v>

47
00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.283
<v Speaker 2>It works perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It communicates a totally unique </v>

48
00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.780
<v Speaker 2>emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quick volusia his team or after with Ren</v>

49
00:03:01.781 --> 00:03:02.614
<v Speaker 2>and stimpy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two characters that actually got under </v>

50
00:03:04.691 --> 00:03:05.524
<v Speaker 2>your skin to characters that were so </v>
<v Speaker 2>unique and dense in their movement and </v>

51
00:03:08.591 --> 00:03:11.800
<v Speaker 2>speech that you had to see a soul in </v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

52
00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:12.783
<v Speaker 2>however twisted that Sol was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this quality has to be what makes </v>

53
00:03:15.701 --> 00:03:19.300
<v Speaker 2>the show so disturbing to every slimy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gunky,</v>

54
00:03:19.301 --> 00:03:24.301
<v Speaker 2>sweaty Harry Wu's had an unnerving </v>
<v Speaker 2>reality and the show played on anxieties</v>

55
00:03:25.211 --> 00:03:26.044
<v Speaker 2>about bodily fluids at a time when the </v>
<v Speaker 2>United States was at the height of its </v>

56
00:03:28.991 --> 00:03:30.450
<v Speaker 2>fears about the aids.</v>

57
00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.720
<v Speaker 3>Derek,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe that they should have separate</v>

58
00:03:32.721 --> 00:03:33.554
<v Speaker 3>hospitals so that the people that have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>good go in there and not be in regular </v>

59
00:03:36.711 --> 00:03:38.540
<v Speaker 3>hospitals but that day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

60
00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:39.433
<v Speaker 2>kids loved Ren and stimpy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It had higher ratings in its first year </v>

61
00:03:42.681 --> 00:03:45.920
<v Speaker 2>than fellow Nick toons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doug and regret's combined.</v>

62
00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.830
<v Speaker 2>The creators maintained that they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the kids side,</v>

63
00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.840
<v Speaker 2>spoonfed morals in school at home and on</v>
<v Speaker 2>just about every children's show,</v>

64
00:03:53.841 --> 00:03:57.440
<v Speaker 2>animated or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ren and stimpy offered lesson free,</v>

65
00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.810
<v Speaker 2>Zany Gross,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous humor.</v>

66
00:03:59.811 --> 00:04:00.644
<v Speaker 2>What quick flu see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>believe was the point of cartoons </v>

67
00:04:02.631 --> 00:04:03.464
<v Speaker 2>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and escape parents groups protested the </v>

68
00:04:05.481 --> 00:04:06.314
<v Speaker 2>show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the audience had spoken and indeed </v>

69
00:04:07.851 --> 00:04:08.684
<v Speaker 2>in that first year at 35 percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who watched ren and stimpy were </v>

70
00:04:11.481 --> 00:04:12.314
<v Speaker 2>over 18 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>MTV started rerunning the first season </v>

71
00:04:15.621 --> 00:04:17.630
<v Speaker 2>at 7:00</v>
<v Speaker 2>PM instead of 11:00</v>

72
00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.620
<v Speaker 2>AM viewing parties were arranged at </v>
<v Speaker 2>college campuses and for good reason,</v>

73
00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:24.950
<v Speaker 2>like the adult swim cartoons that are in</v>
<v Speaker 2>many ways it's spawn.</v>

74
00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.933
<v Speaker 2>Ren and stimpy mixed absurd character </v>
<v Speaker 2>driven action with sly parodies of </v>

75
00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:34.120
<v Speaker 2>earlier cartoons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>satirical and sometimes treasonous gags.</v>

76
00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:35.083
<v Speaker 2>Like when powdered toast man burned the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bill of rights in the constitution to </v>

77
00:04:37.431 --> 00:04:42.431
<v Speaker 2>keep warm sexual innuendo that was off </v>
<v Speaker 2>the charts and just genuinely terrifying</v>

78
00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.450
<v Speaker 2>moments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The police,</v>

79
00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.100
<v Speaker 2>Ren and stimpy didn't hold back on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>insanity of its characters.</v>

80
00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:53.123
<v Speaker 2>Number of times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wren goes completely psychotic and the </v>

81
00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:59.780
<v Speaker 2>honesty and quick for Lucy's voice </v>
<v Speaker 2>acting coupled with the manic animation,</v>

82
00:04:59.781 --> 00:05:03.500
<v Speaker 2>including glaring abstract backgrounds </v>
<v Speaker 2>and sound effects,</v>

83
00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:08.950
<v Speaker 2>is enough to pull the viewer into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cartoon and into that palpable distress.</v>

84
00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:16.250
<v Speaker 2>The creators of Ren and stimpy had </v>
<v Speaker 2>healthy disdain for the way cartoons had</v>

85
00:05:16.251 --> 00:05:17.084
<v Speaker 2>aggressively commercialized and </v>
<v Speaker 2>commodified childhood with merchandise </v>

86
00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:25.470
<v Speaker 2>as simple well as simple as a log log,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they regretted that their peers were</v>

87
00:05:26.121 --> 00:05:29.810
<v Speaker 2>forced feeding ethical norms to their </v>
<v Speaker 2>audiences on a weekly basis,</v>

88
00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:33.380
<v Speaker 2>so they made a show that brilliantly </v>
<v Speaker 2>mocked these things,</v>

89
00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:34.483
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think Crikey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for Lucy's ultimate goal was to make </v>

90
00:05:36.351 --> 00:05:37.184
<v Speaker 2>something for adults.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he wanted to create a show for </v>

91
00:05:39.651 --> 00:05:40.484
<v Speaker 2>kids to marvel at something that yanked </v>
<v Speaker 2>your attention the way the old clampett </v>

92
00:05:43.731 --> 00:05:47.600
<v Speaker 2>cartoons did something as dark and seedy</v>
<v Speaker 2>as the original fairytales,</v>

93
00:05:47.601 --> 00:05:52.601
<v Speaker 2>but uproariously funny and inventive in </v>
<v Speaker 2>every frame to do this scrip flu seat,</v>

94
00:05:53.001 --> 00:05:57.740
<v Speaker 2>push the system to its limits and was </v>
<v Speaker 2>eventually fired after the season.</v>

95
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.800
<v Speaker 2>The show went on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the richest episodes were during his</v>

96
00:06:00.801 --> 00:06:01.634
<v Speaker 2>reign in 91 and 92.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The series masterpiece stimpy's </v>

97
00:06:04.311 --> 00:06:09.230
<v Speaker 2>invention took a full year to produce.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now maybe that was overkill,</v>

98
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:10.183
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's no doubt that obsessive attention </v>

99
00:06:12.711 --> 00:06:17.711
<v Speaker 2>to detail that burned ren and stimpy </v>
<v Speaker 2>onto all of our brains</v>

100
00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:19.373
<v Speaker 4>forever.</v>
