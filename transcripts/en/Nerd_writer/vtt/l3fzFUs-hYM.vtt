00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.950
<v Speaker 1>I am not a destroyer of companies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am a liberator up them.</v>

2
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:20.170
<v Speaker 2>The point is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ladies and gentlemen at Gree,</v>

3
00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.440
<v Speaker 2>for lack of a better word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is good.</v>

4
00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.060
<v Speaker 2>Greed is right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Greed works.</v>

5
00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.980
<v Speaker 2>Greed clarifies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cuts through and captures.</v>

6
00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:33.343
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think evolutionary spirit in all of </v>

7
00:00:37.421 --> 00:00:39.340
<v Speaker 2>its forms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd for life,</v>

8
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.940
<v Speaker 2>for money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for love.</v>

9
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.780
<v Speaker 2>Knowledge has mark upward search of </v>
<v Speaker 2>mankind in green.</v>

10
00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.090
<v Speaker 2>You mark my words will not only save </v>
<v Speaker 2>till dark paper,</v>

11
00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.420
<v Speaker 2>but that other malfunctioning </v>
<v Speaker 2>corporation called the USA.</v>

12
00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:57.490
<v Speaker 2>Thank you very much.</v>

13
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.430
<v Speaker 1>Despite this famous speech from Oliver </v>
<v Speaker 1>Stone's Wallstreet,</v>

14
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.860
<v Speaker 1>extolling the virtues of greed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>excess and capitalist,</v>

15
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.840
<v Speaker 1>no one could ever accuse stone or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>film itself of doing the same thing.</v>

16
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:10.763
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because of Gordon Gekkos sermon </v>

17
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.080
<v Speaker 1>that we know the opposite is true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we're all greedy,</v>

18
00:01:16.081 --> 00:01:19.770
<v Speaker 1>we can win together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the essence of Geckos message.</v>

19
00:01:19.771 --> 00:01:20.604
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oliver stone and the rest of us know </v>

20
00:01:21.931 --> 00:01:22.764
<v Speaker 1>that in a connected capitalist society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>greed always works at the expense of </v>

21
00:01:28.111 --> 00:01:28.944
<v Speaker 1>others and when later in the film we </v>
<v Speaker 1>watch Bud Fox learn how Gecko plan to </v>

22
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:33.593
<v Speaker 1>gain at the expense of his father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The moral hypocrisy of Gecko and the </v>

23
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.730
<v Speaker 1>film central condemnation of capitalists</v>
<v Speaker 1>excess is laid bare,</v>

24
00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.120
<v Speaker 1>but that was then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this</v>

25
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.450
<v Speaker 3>I think I was asked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the omen.</v>

26
00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.290
<v Speaker 3>I keep it on it like the Romans three </v>
<v Speaker 3>pitches where the child is.</v>

27
00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:54.980
<v Speaker 3>We live in the moment</v>

28
00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.953
<v Speaker 1>26 years after Oliver Stone Wall Street,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Martin Scorsese gives us the wolf of </v>

29
00:02:08.031 --> 00:02:08.864
<v Speaker 1>Wall Street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Compare Gordon Gekkos moral defense of </v>

30
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.840
<v Speaker 1>excess with these comments made by </v>
<v Speaker 1>Scorsese's protagonists.</v>

31
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.500
<v Speaker 1>Jordan Belfort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was selling garbage to garbage men and</v>

32
00:02:18.501 --> 00:02:21.440
<v Speaker 1>making cash hand over fist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I was selling them shit.</v>

33
00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.460
<v Speaker 1>The way I looked at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their money was better off in my pocket.</v>

34
00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.700
<v Speaker 1>I knew how to spend it better for unlike</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gecko,</v>

35
00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.510
<v Speaker 1>makes no moral argument for his great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knows what he's doing is wrong.</v>

36
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:33.673
<v Speaker 1>He does it anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There no great tragedy haunting his </v>

37
00:02:35.421 --> 00:02:36.254
<v Speaker 1>steps like the downfall of Gordon Gekko </v>
<v Speaker 1>or the extreme paranoia and eventual </v>

38
00:02:40.041 --> 00:02:43.280
<v Speaker 1>disappearance of one of Scorsese's other</v>
<v Speaker 1>great protagonists,</v>

39
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.233
<v Speaker 1>Henry Hill from goodfellas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Belfour does go to prison for a short </v>

40
00:02:47.361 --> 00:02:48.950
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as he soon discovers,</v>

41
00:02:48.951 --> 00:02:49.784
<v Speaker 1>see for a brief fleeting moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd forgotten I was rich and I lived in </v>

42
00:02:56.001 --> 00:02:56.834
<v Speaker 1>a place where everything was for sale </v>
<v Speaker 1>for its crimes are met with minimal </v>

43
00:03:01.121 --> 00:03:03.880
<v Speaker 1>punishment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both physical and psychological,</v>

44
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.100
<v Speaker 1>and just to twist the knife on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact,</v>

45
00:03:06.101 --> 00:03:09.790
<v Speaker 1>scorsese has the man himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the actual Jordan Belfort,</v>

46
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.950
<v Speaker 1>introduces character as</v>

47
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.580
<v Speaker 4>single,</v>
<v Speaker 4>baddest motherfucker I have ever met,</v>

48
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.900
<v Speaker 1>so maybe it's no surprise that the wolf </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Wall Street was raked through the mud</v>

49
00:03:19.901 --> 00:03:22.960
<v Speaker 1>by a number of critics for glorifying </v>
<v Speaker 1>apologizing,</v>

50
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.680
<v Speaker 1>endorsing capitalists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Excess Scorsese's film certainly doesn't</v>

51
00:03:26.681 --> 00:03:30.820
<v Speaker 1>offer the negative critique of tragedies</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Wall Street or goodfellas.</v>

52
00:03:30.821 --> 00:03:31.654
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't even offer a satirical </v>
<v Speaker 1>critique of late capitalism such as you </v>

53
00:03:34.571 --> 00:03:39.040
<v Speaker 1>might see in films like American Psycho,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where Patrick Bateman's smooth,</v>

54
00:03:39.041 --> 00:03:43.120
<v Speaker 1>almost enlightened exterior is </v>
<v Speaker 1>undermined by his psychopathy,</v>

55
00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.670
<v Speaker 1>self-loathing and psychological </v>
<v Speaker 1>breakdown.</v>

56
00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.610
<v Speaker 1>A satirical critique of capitalism would</v>
<v Speaker 1>require the movie itself in its tone and</v>

57
00:03:51.611 --> 00:03:56.611
<v Speaker 1>themes to ridicule or expose the </v>
<v Speaker 1>improper behavior it displays,</v>

58
00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.650
<v Speaker 1>but the wolf of Wall Street gives us no </v>
<v Speaker 1>such thing.</v>

59
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.460
<v Speaker 1>The joke is never on Jordan Belfort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's on everyone else,</v>

60
00:04:03.461 --> 00:04:04.960
<v Speaker 1>his wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his friends,</v>

61
00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.913
<v Speaker 1>his enemies and the world at large.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not made aware of some unknown </v>

62
00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:10.870
<v Speaker 1>underwriting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sadness,</v>

63
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.883
<v Speaker 1>quite the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Belfort is perfectly disaffected by the </v>

64
00:04:14.351 --> 00:04:19.040
<v Speaker 1>scummy ways he makes his money and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>debauchery lifestyle he spends it on.</v>

65
00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:22.450
<v Speaker 1>His personal philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>echoes that of alien from harmony,</v>

66
00:04:22.451 --> 00:04:24.730
<v Speaker 1>corrine's spring breakers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people,</v>

67
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.920
<v Speaker 1>they want to do the right thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doing the wrong thing was always telling</v>

68
00:04:29.921 --> 00:04:30.431
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

69
00:04:30.431 --> 00:04:35.431
<v Speaker 1>you've got to change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm about and change stack and change as</v>

70
00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:37.443
<v Speaker 1>it money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both films are prime examples of what </v>

71
00:04:39.791 --> 00:04:40.624
<v Speaker 1>film critic is he black has called the </v>
<v Speaker 1>new cinema of excess films in which </v>

72
00:04:44.711 --> 00:04:49.630
<v Speaker 1>greed and excess are explored,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but never for a moment condemned.</v>

73
00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:50.713
<v Speaker 1>Indeed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A key feature of this kind of cinema is </v>

74
00:04:52.091 --> 00:04:55.720
<v Speaker 1>that the film itself partakes in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>excess.</v>

75
00:04:55.721 --> 00:04:58.300
<v Speaker 1>It shows nowhere is this more clear than</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Wolf,</v>

76
00:04:58.301 --> 00:05:01.540
<v Speaker 1>which runs for three hours and moves </v>
<v Speaker 1>from montage too.</v>

77
00:05:01.541 --> 00:05:04.410
<v Speaker 1>Montage in ever crazier flights of </v>
<v Speaker 1>hedonism,</v>

78
00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:05.733
<v Speaker 1>but just because Scorsese refuses to </v>
<v Speaker 1>condemn bail for it doesn't mean that </v>

79
00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:13.060
<v Speaker 1>he's by extension endorsing him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Either.</v>

80
00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.210
<v Speaker 1>Excess is excess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's exhausting.</v>

81
00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.530
<v Speaker 1>It's too much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>too fast.</v>

82
00:05:17.531 --> 00:05:22.531
<v Speaker 1>Scorsese has no illusions about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His extensive use of closeup reveals the</v>

83
00:05:22.691 --> 00:05:27.580
<v Speaker 1>vulgarity of this way of living is </v>
<v Speaker 1>montage is exhaust rather than glamorize</v>

84
00:05:27.581 --> 00:05:30.820
<v Speaker 1>the hedonism two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which were privy is less attractive than</v>

85
00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.190
<v Speaker 1>disorienting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>less desirable than</v>

86
00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:38.030
<v Speaker 4>well will not die sober,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get don't fuck.</v>

87
00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.010
<v Speaker 4>Walls.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Street</v>

88
00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.290
<v Speaker 1>is a descriptive project learning from </v>
<v Speaker 1>its moralizing predecessors,</v>

89
00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.920
<v Speaker 1>even the predecessors in Scorsese's own </v>
<v Speaker 1>filmography.</v>

90
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:52.150
<v Speaker 1>There were no bud Fox is to take down </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Gordon Gekkos of the eighties.</v>

91
00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.630
<v Speaker 1>There wasn't even any one to take down </v>
<v Speaker 1>Belfort's elk in the nineties.</v>

92
00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.480
<v Speaker 1>The folly of late capitalism got worse </v>
<v Speaker 1>and worse,</v>

93
00:05:59.481 --> 00:06:03.170
<v Speaker 1>not hitting its lowest point until 2008 </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the financial recession,</v>

94
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:05.960
<v Speaker 1>and it's unclear despite new </v>
<v Speaker 1>regulations,</v>

95
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.500
<v Speaker 1>if any of those lessons were really </v>
<v Speaker 1>taken to heart.</v>

96
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:10.513
<v Speaker 1>The reason for this is because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>excesses of Jordan Belfort are our </v>

97
00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:16.910
<v Speaker 1>excess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like him were to enlightened not to</v>

98
00:06:16.911 --> 00:06:17.744
<v Speaker 1>know the expenses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are gazillion products are made </v>

99
00:06:20.751 --> 00:06:21.584
<v Speaker 1>like him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't really make an attempt at </v>

100
00:06:23.271 --> 00:06:26.090
<v Speaker 1>moralizing away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our involvement in that system.</v>

101
00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:31.540
<v Speaker 1>We just don't care to discuss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We feel for Belfort is hypocritical.</v>

102
00:06:31.971 --> 00:06:32.804
<v Speaker 1>The indignation we inflict on him is </v>
<v Speaker 1>less a righteous act than a self </v>

103
00:06:36.641 --> 00:06:37.474
<v Speaker 1>righteous dilution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scorsese refuses to participate in that </v>

104
00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.193
<v Speaker 1>delusion anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the result is a film so </v>

105
00:06:45.291 --> 00:06:50.291
<v Speaker 1>unapologetically excessive that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience might finally realized that the</v>

106
00:06:51.141 --> 00:06:54.560
<v Speaker 1>screen they thought they were watching </v>
<v Speaker 1>was</v>

107
00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.630
<v Speaker 5>in fact a camera.</v>
