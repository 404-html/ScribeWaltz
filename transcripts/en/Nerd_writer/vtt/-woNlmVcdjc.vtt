1
00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.340
<v Speaker 1>Homeland Security bill is ratified after</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight years.</v>

2
00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:05.380
<v Speaker 1>British borders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will remain closed.</v>

3
00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:07.990
<v Speaker 1>The deportation of illegal immigrants </v>
<v Speaker 1>will continue.</v>

4
00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:10.120
<v Speaker 1>Good morning our lead story.</v>

5
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.740
<v Speaker 2>The world was stunned today by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>desert,</v>

6
00:00:12.741 --> 00:00:13.940
<v Speaker 2>Diego,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ricardo,</v>

7
00:00:13.941 --> 00:00:14.774
<v Speaker 2>the youngest person on the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe Diego was stabbed outside of bar </v>

8
00:00:18.761 --> 00:00:19.660
<v Speaker 2>and what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Osiris.</v>

9
00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.640
<v Speaker 1>Here we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

10
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.770
<v Speaker 1>funds will Korans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Children of men is a shot of an audience</v>

11
00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.903
<v Speaker 1>getting information about the state of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things in the same way that we do </v>

12
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.270
<v Speaker 1>through the media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You may have missed it,</v>

13
00:00:34.271 --> 00:00:35.104
<v Speaker 1>but Korans fundamental motif of </v>
<v Speaker 1>contrasting foreground and background </v>

14
00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.650
<v Speaker 1>has already been established through the</v>
<v Speaker 1>media before this shot even begins.</v>

15
00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:50.130
<v Speaker 1>Let's back up on the deportation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>illegal immigrants will continue.</v>

16
00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.270
<v Speaker 1>Good morning our lead story like </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone else.</v>

17
00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:59.260
<v Speaker 1>The media prioritizes information based </v>
<v Speaker 1>on its values.</v>

18
00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.153
<v Speaker 1>So much attention is paid to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>foreground to the lead story that the </v>

19
00:01:03.931 --> 00:01:06.550
<v Speaker 1>background can go by without much </v>
<v Speaker 1>notice.</v>

20
00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:07.503
<v Speaker 1>The lead story of children of men is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>story of feel in a future world nearing </v>

21
00:01:11.351 --> 00:01:12.184
<v Speaker 1>its end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because women have lost the ability to </v>

22
00:01:13.811 --> 00:01:17.230
<v Speaker 1>have children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Theo and apathetic government bureaucrat</v>

23
00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:18.393
<v Speaker 1>returns to his roots as a political </v>
<v Speaker 1>activist after he sees that there is </v>

24
00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:23.920
<v Speaker 1>still hope left for humanity.</v>

25
00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.980
<v Speaker 1>The film plays as an exciting action </v>
<v Speaker 1>thriller,</v>

26
00:01:26.981 --> 00:01:31.660
<v Speaker 1>as Leo helps the pregnant key get to </v>
<v Speaker 1>safety with the human project,</v>

27
00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.750
<v Speaker 1>but as the plot moves along it's linear </v>
<v Speaker 1>path.</v>

28
00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:35.643
<v Speaker 1>Following Theo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the camera repeatedly becomes </v>

29
00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.500
<v Speaker 1>preoccupied with what's going on in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>background,</v>

30
00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:42.693
<v Speaker 1>and this is a technique that Koran has </v>
<v Speaker 1>used in the past and it makes for an </v>

31
00:01:45.431 --> 00:01:46.264
<v Speaker 1>interesting effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As in thousands of other films we </v>

32
00:01:49.001 --> 00:01:52.720
<v Speaker 1>experienced the world through the eyes </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the main character.</v>

33
00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.070
<v Speaker 1>This process of identification is </v>
<v Speaker 1>automatic and strong,</v>

34
00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.963
<v Speaker 1>so strong that we can even be made to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sympathize with people who we would </v>

35
00:02:00.701 --> 00:02:01.534
<v Speaker 1>otherwise identify as bad or evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when the camera actively breaks that </v>

36
00:02:06.611 --> 00:02:11.110
<v Speaker 1>identification and shows us imagery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lead character doesn't see or notice</v>

37
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.333
<v Speaker 1>were made forcefully aware in a purely </v>
<v Speaker 1>visual way of the perspective of the </v>

38
00:02:16.991 --> 00:02:19.510
<v Speaker 1>film itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In children of men.</v>

39
00:02:19.511 --> 00:02:22.270
<v Speaker 1>That perspective is absorbed by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>background,</v>

40
00:02:22.271 --> 00:02:24.600
<v Speaker 1>by a bleak great winter break.</v>

41
00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.780
<v Speaker 1>The only country in the world still </v>
<v Speaker 1>under stable government control.</v>

42
00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.063
<v Speaker 1>This background scene always at a side </v>
<v Speaker 1>angle probes and investigates the </v>

43
00:02:34.241 --> 00:02:35.074
<v Speaker 1>conditions of that stability and whether</v>
<v Speaker 1>or not it's worth what sacrificed to </v>

44
00:02:39.161 --> 00:02:39.994
<v Speaker 1>have it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>though it's dressed up with the few </v>

45
00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.393
<v Speaker 1>futuristic flourishes the World Koran </v>
<v Speaker 1>presents to us is a reflection of our </v>

46
00:02:46.661 --> 00:02:49.270
<v Speaker 1>own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The grim combination of nationalistic,</v>

47
00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.300
<v Speaker 1>xenophobic politics and late capitalist </v>
<v Speaker 1>consumerism isn't something that we have</v>

48
00:02:54.551 --> 00:02:59.551
<v Speaker 1>to imagine when Mexico sends its people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not sending best.</v>

49
00:02:59.801 --> 00:03:02.650
<v Speaker 1>They're bringing drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're bringing crime.</v>

50
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.840
<v Speaker 1>They're rapists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In 2006.</v>

51
00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:07.840
<v Speaker 1>When this film was made only five years </v>
<v Speaker 1>after nine slash 11,</v>

52
00:03:07.841 --> 00:03:10.390
<v Speaker 1>and at the height of the war on terror,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was,</v>

53
00:03:10.391 --> 00:03:13.470
<v Speaker 1>and in many ways still is the state of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

54
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.560
<v Speaker 1>Thousands of migrants and refugees from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the war torn and Middle East and Africa.</v>

55
00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:21.580
<v Speaker 1>A rude awakening awaits in countries </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are moving to close their doors.</v>

56
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.473
<v Speaker 1>And there's another background to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>figurative background of cultural </v>

57
00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.490
<v Speaker 1>reference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

58
00:03:27.491 --> 00:03:28.324
<v Speaker 1>when key first reveals her pregnancy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she stands in a posture reminiscent of </v>

59
00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:33.123
<v Speaker 1>Botticelli's birth of Venus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the many references in this film </v>

60
00:03:36.581 --> 00:03:40.310
<v Speaker 1>to maternity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jasper and Miriam both recite,</v>

61
00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:41.243
<v Speaker 1>teach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're calling both the pawnee shots and </v>

62
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:44.733
<v Speaker 1>ts Elliot's the wasteland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a major source of inspiration </v>

63
00:03:48.521 --> 00:03:53.080
<v Speaker 1>for an infertile world that's lost its </v>
<v Speaker 1>way outside Theo's cousins,</v>

64
00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.973
<v Speaker 1>arc of arts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A pig floats above the old battersea </v>

65
00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.760
<v Speaker 1>power station and overt reference to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pink floyd's album animals.</v>

66
00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.290
<v Speaker 1>A concept album loosely based on George </v>
<v Speaker 1>Orwell's animal farm itself,</v>

67
00:04:05.291 --> 00:04:09.910
<v Speaker 1>a satirical indictment of authoritarian </v>
<v Speaker 1>socialism or Stalinism.</v>

68
00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.370
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot included in the arc of art</v>

69
00:04:12.371 --> 00:04:14.080
<v Speaker 1>scene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's a banksy.</v>

70
00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.093
<v Speaker 1>Here's Michelangelo's David,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because those guarantee TCA </v>

71
00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.273
<v Speaker 1>significantly framing theo in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>realities of war and underneath it all </v>

72
00:04:22.031 --> 00:04:22.864
<v Speaker 1>plays King Crimson's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>progressive rock anthem to the court of </v>

73
00:04:26.111 --> 00:04:29.800
<v Speaker 1>the Crimson King,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blending the sacred and the profane,</v>

74
00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:31.683
<v Speaker 1>but Korans referencing becomes more </v>
<v Speaker 1>potent as the inter texts layer and </v>

75
00:04:36.041 --> 00:04:36.874
<v Speaker 1>connect.</v>

76
00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:37.743
<v Speaker 1>Take this shot here at utilizes nearly </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the techniques I've mentioned so </v>

77
00:04:40.721 --> 00:04:41.554
<v Speaker 1>far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have the lead story moving again </v>

78
00:04:43.661 --> 00:04:47.320
<v Speaker 1>towards its destination at the sea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the camera,</v>

79
00:04:47.321 --> 00:04:50.680
<v Speaker 1>it leaves them for a moment to focus on </v>
<v Speaker 1>this mother,</v>

80
00:04:50.681 --> 00:04:51.514
<v Speaker 1>cradling her dead son.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The most immediate citation here is to </v>

81
00:04:54.701 --> 00:04:56.800
<v Speaker 1>Michelangelo's famous sculpture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>La,</v>

82
00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:57.460
<v Speaker 1>PA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ta,</v>

83
00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.890
<v Speaker 1>which Nigel mentioned earlier in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>film.</v>

84
00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.600
<v Speaker 1>Good luck top smashed up before we got </v>
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>

85
00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.150
<v Speaker 1>and that sculpture at Mary holds the </v>
<v Speaker 1>crucified Jesus in her arms,</v>

86
00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:08.103
<v Speaker 1>questioning the cruelty of men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The image also evokes guernica also </v>

87
00:05:12.041 --> 00:05:16.570
<v Speaker 1>shown earlier in the film a much more </v>
<v Speaker 1>modern meditation on the horrors of war,</v>

88
00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:17.433
<v Speaker 1>and Oran has said in interviews that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>inspiration for this image came from a </v>

89
00:05:21.041 --> 00:05:24.150
<v Speaker 1>photograph out of the Balkan wars </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself,</v>

90
00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:24.993
<v Speaker 1>a referenced to Michelangelo's work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas the arc of arts shows are </v>

91
00:05:28.061 --> 00:05:30.580
<v Speaker 1>extracted in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>placed in an ivory tower.</v>

92
00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:31.593
<v Speaker 1>Koran puts art back on the ground where </v>
<v Speaker 1>it belongs and brings it alive within a </v>

93
00:05:36.161 --> 00:05:39.370
<v Speaker 1>number of contexts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ancient and current,</v>

94
00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:42.970
<v Speaker 1>and most importantly as a background for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the main story,</v>

95
00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:48.430
<v Speaker 1>there is an absurd paradox that sits at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the center of our modern world.</v>

96
00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:49.593
<v Speaker 1>While capital itself knows no borders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and nations struggling to find </v>

97
00:05:54.701 --> 00:05:55.534
<v Speaker 1>their identities have sought repeatedly </v>
<v Speaker 1>to tighten their borders and restrict </v>

98
00:05:59.211 --> 00:06:01.790
<v Speaker 1>people's from crossing them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's more,</v>

99
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:02.653
<v Speaker 1>these refugees are increasingly </v>
<v Speaker 1>displaced by the militaristic medley of </v>

100
00:06:06.981 --> 00:06:10.340
<v Speaker 1>neoconservative regimes and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>worsening climate,</v>

101
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:11.263
<v Speaker 1>a result of the unchecked expansion of </v>
<v Speaker 1>capitalists enterprises in children of </v>

102
00:06:16.071 --> 00:06:16.904
<v Speaker 1>men as in our own world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of these things are intimately </v>

103
00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.060
<v Speaker 1>connected and yet for each of us </v>
<v Speaker 1>individually,</v>

104
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.910
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to see anything but the </v>
<v Speaker 1>foreground,</v>

105
00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:27.103
<v Speaker 1>the lead story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why the roving curious </v>

106
00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:34.190
<v Speaker 1>preoccupations of Koran's camera are </v>
<v Speaker 1>more than just a site.</v>

107
00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:38.480
<v Speaker 1>By providing a disinterested break from </v>
<v Speaker 1>identification,</v>

108
00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.920
<v Speaker 1>they achieved something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just can't in our own lives.</v>

109
00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:48.190
<v Speaker 1>They let us see the world bear naked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stripped for a moment of subjectivity.</v>

110
00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:52.400
<v Speaker 1>This is the radical political potential </v>
<v Speaker 1>of cinema.</v>

111
00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:56.840
<v Speaker 1>We can all keep to our main stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we want little worlds,</v>

112
00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:02.440
<v Speaker 1>sooner or later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the background is going to come from.</v>

113
00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:10.263
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>

114
00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:13.250
