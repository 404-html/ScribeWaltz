00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.900
<v Speaker 1>Hello little turtles and Octopi coffee </v>
<v Speaker 1>on a Tuesday and blog,</v>

2
00:00:03.901 --> 00:00:05.220
<v Speaker 1>54</v>

3
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.980
<v Speaker 1>at night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I often wonder what I imagined is not an</v>

4
00:00:19.981 --> 00:00:23.760
<v Speaker 1>uncommon reverie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there are aliens out there on planets</v>

5
00:00:23.761 --> 00:00:28.260
<v Speaker 1>orbiting distant stars looking up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>wondering the exact same thing.</v>

6
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.680
<v Speaker 1>If they have evolved like us to build </v>
<v Speaker 1>massive powerful telescopes,</v>

7
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.440
<v Speaker 1>they of course see turning the lens in </v>
<v Speaker 1>our direction,</v>

8
00:00:34.441 --> 00:00:39.441
<v Speaker 1>the great spiral that is the Milky Way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a kind of motion in celestial stillness,</v>

9
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.480
<v Speaker 1>but that's not all dates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zooming out a bit more,</v>

10
00:00:42.481 --> 00:00:43.314
<v Speaker 1>they'd catch a pair of bright clouds </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking almost like children chasing </v>

11
00:00:46.531 --> 00:00:49.390
<v Speaker 1>each other in empty space around their </v>
<v Speaker 1>parent galaxy.</v>

12
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.243
<v Speaker 1>Older and larger sibling would appear </v>
<v Speaker 1>about a 10th as bright as the Milky Way </v>

13
00:00:53.311 --> 00:00:56.400
<v Speaker 1>and the smaller siblings about a fourth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as bright as that.</v>

14
00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.660
<v Speaker 1>These are the magellanic clouds just to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have over a dozen satellite galaxies are</v>

15
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.720
<v Speaker 1>orbiting the Milky Way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What makes these two so distinct is that</v>

16
00:01:03.721 --> 00:01:06.630
<v Speaker 1>unlike their brethren,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are still alive with the materials</v>

17
00:01:06.631 --> 00:01:08.370
<v Speaker 1>necessary for making stars.</v>

18
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:09.203
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the larger Magellanic cloud is so </v>

19
00:01:10.561 --> 00:01:13.380
<v Speaker 1>fertile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it boasts the largest stellar nursery in</v>

20
00:01:13.381 --> 00:01:14.214
<v Speaker 1>our local group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beating out the vastly bigger Andromeda </v>

21
00:01:16.081 --> 00:01:16.914
<v Speaker 1>galaxy and even our own Milky Way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most galactic satellites are dead in </v>

22
00:01:20.101 --> 00:01:20.934
<v Speaker 1>this respect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Gargantuan Gravitational Force of </v>

23
00:01:22.531 --> 00:01:27.210
<v Speaker 1>the parent galaxy usually robs them of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their gas in a process known as titled,</v>

24
00:01:27.211 --> 00:01:28.740
<v Speaker 1>stripping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Without gas,</v>

25
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.873
<v Speaker 1>there can be no stars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These dark dwarf steroidals are the </v>

26
00:01:32.011 --> 00:01:34.430
<v Speaker 1>haunted houses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have a galactic subgroups,</v>

27
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.273
<v Speaker 1>so faintly do they move across the sky </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the first one discovered the </v>

28
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.933
<v Speaker 1>sculptor tour in 1938,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was mistaken for a fingerprint on a </v>

29
00:01:42.091 --> 00:01:42.924
<v Speaker 1>photographic plate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why then or the Magellanic cloud still </v>

30
00:01:44.881 --> 00:01:45.570
<v Speaker 1>viable?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

31
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.720
<v Speaker 1>new data from the Hubble is starting to </v>
<v Speaker 1>reveal some clues.</v>

32
00:01:48.721 --> 00:01:49.554
<v Speaker 1>Yellow astronomer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each a colleague whose name I've just </v>

33
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.333
<v Speaker 1>murdered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>says that there are likely passing us </v>

34
00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.273
<v Speaker 1>for the very first time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means their orbits once thought to </v>

35
00:01:58.531 --> 00:02:02.040
<v Speaker 1>be one to 2 billion years around the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Milky Way might be much,</v>

36
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.080
<v Speaker 1>much longer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They only got close to us.</v>

37
00:02:04.081 --> 00:02:07.950
<v Speaker 1>It seemed some 200 million years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to say just now,</v>

38
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:08.813
<v Speaker 1>for all that previous time they were as </v>
<v Speaker 1>the man indeed and astronomer named </v>

39
00:02:18.731 --> 00:02:19.564
<v Speaker 1>Martina Bates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>left from Columbia University thinks </v>

40
00:02:21.491 --> 00:02:22.324
<v Speaker 1>that the smaller cloud actually smashed </v>
<v Speaker 1>right through the larger initiating an </v>

41
00:02:25.871 --> 00:02:29.410
<v Speaker 1>accelerated star creation and leaving </v>
<v Speaker 1>many of its own stars</v>

42
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.640
<v Speaker 2>behind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

43
00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.630
<v Speaker 1>as I was reading this article in </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific American from which I learned</v>

44
00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.070
<v Speaker 1>many of these things,</v>

45
00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:43.673
<v Speaker 2>I had a thought.</v>

46
00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:45.603
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking how noteworthy it is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mechanics of nature so mimic the </v>

47
00:02:51.941 --> 00:02:54.350
<v Speaker 1>emotional mechanics of our lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

48
00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.153
<v Speaker 2>have you ever</v>

49
00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:57.123
<v Speaker 1>smashed right into somebody?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you move through someone and not </v>

50
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.760
<v Speaker 1>afterwards retained some of their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>stars?</v>

51
00:03:03.761 --> 00:03:04.594
<v Speaker 1>Do we not like these brilliant clouds </v>
<v Speaker 1>leave a trail of ourselves in the wake </v>

52
00:03:07.811 --> 00:03:08.644
<v Speaker 1>of our movement through the world?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is this parallelism between nature </v>

53
00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.080
<v Speaker 1>and humanity?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I began to think the mighty heaven says,</v>

54
00:03:17.081 --> 00:03:22.081
<v Speaker 1>the philosopher PROC lists exhibits in </v>
<v Speaker 1>its transfigurations clear images of the</v>

55
00:03:22.121 --> 00:03:27.121
<v Speaker 1>splendor of intellectual perceptions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as the Magellanic clouds move closer</v>

56
00:03:27.281 --> 00:03:28.114
<v Speaker 1>in their transit to the Milky Way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nearer is pulled away from its </v>

57
00:03:31.421 --> 00:03:32.254
<v Speaker 1>partner and left at such a distance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as would make it impossible for the </v>

58
00:03:35.201 --> 00:03:36.034
<v Speaker 1>dance to continue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The lesser fractured from its earlier </v>

59
00:03:38.981 --> 00:03:43.981
<v Speaker 1>collision will hurdle in the dark to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>gas lists fate and empty nursery,</v>

60
00:03:44.831 --> 00:03:48.340
<v Speaker 1>some haunted fingerprint on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>photographic plate.</v>

61
00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.963
<v Speaker 1>The Universe is the externalization of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the soul wherever the life is that </v>

62
00:04:08.021 --> 00:04:08.854
<v Speaker 1>bursts into appearance around it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our science is central and therefore </v>

63
00:04:12.281 --> 00:04:14.380
<v Speaker 1>superficial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The earth and the heavenly bodies,</v>

64
00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:15.423
<v Speaker 1>physics and chemistry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we sensually treat as if they were self </v>

65
00:04:18.311 --> 00:04:19.144
<v Speaker 1>existent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But these are the retinue of the being </v>

66
00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.610
<v Speaker 1>that we have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Emerson,</v>

67
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.013
<v Speaker 1>the poet.</v>
