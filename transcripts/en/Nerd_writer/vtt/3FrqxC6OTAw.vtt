00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.120
<v Speaker 1>Goodbye Philadelphia and goodbye family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hello coffee on a Tuesday in hd.</v>

2
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.270
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so last week,</v>

3
00:00:21.301 --> 00:00:26.130
<v Speaker 1>48 civilian protesters were killed in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tahrir Square Cairo in Egypt.</v>

4
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.790
<v Speaker 1>Two thousand nine months ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The square looked like this.</v>

5
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.033
<v Speaker 1>So what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you know the story of ancient </v>

6
00:00:37.731 --> 00:00:40.010
<v Speaker 1>Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe Mr Greg spent three whole weeks on</v>

7
00:00:40.011 --> 00:00:43.340
<v Speaker 1>it in fifth grade and you learned about </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pharaohs and Hieroglyphics and pyramids,</v>

8
00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:44.323
<v Speaker 1>which you later made for a project out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of foam board or cardboard or sugar </v>

9
00:00:47.921 --> 00:00:50.540
<v Speaker 1>cubes or cheats at the very least.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know</v>

10
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:52.793
<v Speaker 2>a young man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he never thought in people's standard </v>

11
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.530
<v Speaker 2>feed the boy</v>

12
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:00.703
<v Speaker 1>and maybe you thought all that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinated with the story of modern </v>

13
00:01:03.231 --> 00:01:04.064
<v Speaker 1>Egypt is just as incredible and it's so </v>
<v Speaker 1>much at the heart of the cultural shift </v>

14
00:01:06.531 --> 00:01:07.364
<v Speaker 1>happening in the Middle East right now </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we ought to get an idea of how it </v>

15
00:01:09.741 --> 00:01:10.574
<v Speaker 1>goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

16
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:15.730
<v Speaker 1>it goes like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The man looks and Egyptian military cask</v>

17
00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.900
<v Speaker 1>held power in Egypt from 1250 to 1517 </v>
<v Speaker 1>when the Turks,</v>

18
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.883
<v Speaker 1>the Ottoman Empire bitch him out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>took control and he kept it until 1798 </v>

19
00:01:25.491 --> 00:01:28.100
<v Speaker 1>when Napoleon bitched them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And finally in 18,</v>

20
00:01:28.101 --> 00:01:28.934
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one napoleon himself was bitched by the </v>

21
00:01:30.531 --> 00:01:31.364
<v Speaker 1>Brits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Brits were only there because the </v>

22
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.770
<v Speaker 1>French war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when the French were expelled,</v>

23
00:01:33.771 --> 00:01:35.900
<v Speaker 1>the Brits left to eating a vacuum of </v>
<v Speaker 1>power,</v>

24
00:01:35.901 --> 00:01:38.420
<v Speaker 1>which the Turks and the mamluks jumped </v>
<v Speaker 1>to fill.</v>

25
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.400
<v Speaker 1>In the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was neither work nor Mamluk who seize</v>

26
00:01:40.401 --> 00:01:41.234
<v Speaker 1>control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but rather an Albanian commander who </v>

27
00:01:42.831 --> 00:01:45.980
<v Speaker 1>played the two against each other called</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mohammed Ali.</v>

28
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.290
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that one or that one.</v>

29
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.260
<v Speaker 1>That one here is the beginning of modern</v>
<v Speaker 1>Egypt.</v>

30
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.310
<v Speaker 1>18 Ali began reforming the country into </v>
<v Speaker 1>a modern state building.</v>

31
00:01:55.311 --> 00:01:57.140
<v Speaker 1>It's military,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's industry,</v>

32
00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.003
<v Speaker 1>and it's educated bureaucracy basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>from scratch it more than any man ever </v>

33
00:02:00.921 --> 00:02:01.754
<v Speaker 1>had for Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>single handedly sparking the Arab </v>

34
00:02:03.951 --> 00:02:04.784
<v Speaker 1>renaissance or the Alda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He won some battles and gain some </v>

35
00:02:07.491 --> 00:02:09.950
<v Speaker 1>territory and lost some battles and lost</v>
<v Speaker 1>some territory.</v>

36
00:02:09.951 --> 00:02:11.810
<v Speaker 1>He got older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he got paranoid.</v>

37
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.590
<v Speaker 1>He went crazy and he died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His son assuming power.</v>

38
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.433
<v Speaker 1>Then he died shortly after his nephew </v>
<v Speaker 1>assumed power and he was killed in his </v>

39
00:02:17.961 --> 00:02:18.794
<v Speaker 1>fourth son.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then his grandson and his great </v>

40
00:02:20.151 --> 00:02:21.660
<v Speaker 1>grandson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lesser men.</v>

41
00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.440
<v Speaker 1>By the 18 eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Egypt had become completely dependent on</v>

42
00:02:24.441 --> 00:02:25.274
<v Speaker 1>England and France for a healthy economy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when they tried to break away </v>

43
00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.943
<v Speaker 1>England,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sent in its forces and occupied the </v>

44
00:02:29.361 --> 00:02:30.194
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>state under occupation until after the </v>

45
00:02:31.581 --> 00:02:32.320
<v Speaker 1>first world war.</v>

46
00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.430
<v Speaker 1>When the war party led by sod,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so cool.</v>

47
00:02:34.431 --> 00:02:35.264
<v Speaker 1>Ask for independence from Britain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something they thought they had been </v>

48
00:02:37.641 --> 00:02:42.641
<v Speaker 1>promised for their sacrifice in the war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They exiled to go to Malta,</v>

49
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.720
<v Speaker 1>and this sparked a grassroots uprising,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the revolution of 1919.</v>

50
00:02:47.721 --> 00:02:48.554
<v Speaker 1>The result of this was the official </v>
<v Speaker 1>independence of Egypt in 1992 and the </v>

51
00:02:51.681 --> 00:02:54.050
<v Speaker 1>drafting of the Constitution a year </v>
<v Speaker 1>later,</v>

52
00:02:54.051 --> 00:02:57.950
<v Speaker 1>but their independence was largely in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The agent was now a monarchy with a king</v>

53
00:02:57.951 --> 00:03:00.720
<v Speaker 1>backed by the British and subservient to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the British Consulate,</v>

54
00:03:00.721 --> 00:03:01.554
<v Speaker 1>Jim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He died before World War Two and was </v>

55
00:03:02.531 --> 00:03:05.300
<v Speaker 1>replaced with 16 year old King Farouk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The.</v>

56
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.030
<v Speaker 1>This guy was a British puppet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Brits used Egypt as a base of allied</v>

57
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.120
<v Speaker 1>operations all throughout World War II </v>
<v Speaker 1>propaganda from Germany,</v>

58
00:03:13.121 --> 00:03:17.470
<v Speaker 1>the Soviet Union and the United States </v>
<v Speaker 1>all added to anti British.</v>

59
00:03:17.471 --> 00:03:20.980
<v Speaker 1>Sent them in 1948 Egypt blunder through </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Arab Israeli war,</v>

60
00:03:20.981 --> 00:03:21.814
<v Speaker 1>losing 78 percent of Palestine and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>process the country blamed you guessed </v>

61
00:03:25.181 --> 00:03:26.014
<v Speaker 1>it for the movement called the Free </v>
<v Speaker 1>Officers led by Mohammed the grief and </v>

62
00:03:29.141 --> 00:03:29.530
<v Speaker 1>the mall.</v>

63
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.770
<v Speaker 1>Nasir orchestrated a military coup in </v>
<v Speaker 1>1952,</v>

64
00:03:32.771 --> 00:03:33.604
<v Speaker 1>Egypt's second 20th century revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They overthrew for root tossed away the </v>

65
00:03:36.881 --> 00:03:40.190
<v Speaker 1>1923 constitution and declared Egypt a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Repub,</v>

66
00:03:40.191 --> 00:03:44.680
<v Speaker 1>setting up a one party system made of </v>
<v Speaker 1>all three officers called the liberation</v>

67
00:03:44.681 --> 00:03:45.910
<v Speaker 1>route.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now Gleam was declared,</v>

68
00:03:45.911 --> 00:03:48.770
<v Speaker 1>the first president of Uja drafted a new</v>
<v Speaker 1>constitution,</v>

69
00:03:48.771 --> 00:03:49.604
<v Speaker 1>a secular in nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which a group called the Muslim </v>

70
00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:52.870
<v Speaker 1>Brotherhood apoe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two years later,</v>

71
00:03:52.871 --> 00:03:56.170
<v Speaker 1>the Muslim Brotherhood was outlawed as </v>
<v Speaker 1>an illegal political organization.</v>

72
00:03:56.171 --> 00:03:57.004
<v Speaker 1>Two years after that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the Gui was replaced with Nasser as </v>

73
00:03:59.081 --> 00:04:01.960
<v Speaker 1>the second president of Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and his first action was to announce the</v>

74
00:04:01.961 --> 00:04:05.440
<v Speaker 1>nationalization of the Suez Canal is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>manmade canal,</v>

75
00:04:05.441 --> 00:04:06.274
<v Speaker 1>was a trade super highway for the middle</v>
<v Speaker 1>of England and France were pissed </v>

76
00:04:09.041 --> 00:04:09.874
<v Speaker 1>because they use the canal so much that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they hatched a plan with Israel to </v>

77
00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:14.573
<v Speaker 1>overflow.</v>

78
00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:25.250
<v Speaker 3>Naval Base Britain prepares well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The worst crisis,</v>

79
00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.960
<v Speaker 1>it was a secret plan at a stupid plant </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they should have told the US because</v>

80
00:04:28.961 --> 00:04:30.790
<v Speaker 1>when I found out he was pissed,</v>

81
00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.670
<v Speaker 4>not consulted in any way about any phase</v>
<v Speaker 4>of these actions.</v>

82
00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.450
<v Speaker 1>Wes was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get the fuck out of their service.</v>

83
00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:42.310
<v Speaker 1>Prestige was cemented by a proxy victory</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the Suez Canal crisis.</v>

84
00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:43.173
<v Speaker 1>He rolled for another 18 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>promoted pan Arab Islam all throughout </v>

85
00:04:46.061 --> 00:04:48.490
<v Speaker 1>his term lead the six day war against </v>
<v Speaker 1>Israel,</v>

86
00:04:48.491 --> 00:04:52.210
<v Speaker 1>which he lost embarrassingly and then he</v>
<v Speaker 1>died quietly,</v>

87
00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:57.010
<v Speaker 1>is vice president Anwar Sadat succeeded </v>
<v Speaker 1>him as the third president of Egypt,</v>

88
00:04:57.011 --> 00:05:00.430
<v Speaker 1>so that's most notable accomplishment </v>
<v Speaker 1>was his participation in the camp.</v>

89
00:05:00.431 --> 00:05:04.720
<v Speaker 1>David accords with President Carter and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Prime Minister David Ben Gurion,</v>

90
00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.930
<v Speaker 1>which led to the eventual peace treaty </v>
<v Speaker 1>with Israel Treaty,</v>

91
00:05:07.931 --> 00:05:08.764
<v Speaker 1>which is still honored today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Sudan and Egypt were ostracized for </v>

92
00:05:11.231 --> 00:05:12.064
<v Speaker 1>this from the Arab League.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Opposition came at them from all sides </v>

93
00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.880
<v Speaker 1>and during a military parade on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sixth of October,</v>

94
00:05:15.881 --> 00:05:16.714
<v Speaker 1>1981 for assassins broke through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>barricades and killed his vice </v>

95
00:05:20.201 --> 00:05:23.440
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hosni Mubarak assume power as the fourth</v>

96
00:05:23.441 --> 00:05:24.274
<v Speaker 1>and last president of Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mubarak maintain the peace agreement </v>

97
00:05:26.771 --> 00:05:27.604
<v Speaker 1>with Israel while salvaging Egypt's </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship with the Arab Lee being </v>

98
00:05:31.091 --> 00:05:31.780
<v Speaker 1>readmitted.</v>

99
00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:32.613
<v Speaker 1>In 1989,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he privatized much of the economy and </v>

100
00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:37.330
<v Speaker 1>Egypt saw extreme growth in the 19 </v>
<v Speaker 1>nineties,</v>

101
00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.830
<v Speaker 1>partly due to the $14,000,000,000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had gotten debt relief for participation</v>

102
00:05:41.831 --> 00:05:42.664
<v Speaker 1>in the Gulf War,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Mubarak was an autocrat like sedans </v>

103
00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:51.300
<v Speaker 1>before him and Nasir before him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He reigned unchallenged for 26 years and</v>

104
00:05:52.031 --> 00:05:55.840
<v Speaker 1>in the first election that saw a second </v>
<v Speaker 1>candidate in 2005.</v>

105
00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:57.250
<v Speaker 1>That candidate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amen.</v>

106
00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:58.133
<v Speaker 1>Our was imprisoned and we can forget </v>
<v Speaker 1>that Egypt has been under emergency law </v>

107
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:03.103
<v Speaker 1>since 1967,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is spends constitutional rights </v>

108
00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:10.100
<v Speaker 1>legalize the censorship and extends </v>
<v Speaker 1>police powers under Mubarak.</v>

109
00:06:10.101 --> 00:06:10.934
<v Speaker 1>There were repeated occurrences of </v>
<v Speaker 1>police brutality and severe corruption </v>

110
00:06:13.821 --> 00:06:14.654
<v Speaker 1>among government officials who were </v>
<v Speaker 1>hoarding massive amounts of wealth for </v>

111
00:06:18.081 --> 00:06:18.914
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By 2011 after a severe worldwide </v>

112
00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:22.003
<v Speaker 1>economic crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the emotion came to a head and we </v>

113
00:06:24.201 --> 00:06:25.034
<v Speaker 1>watched day by day as protestors storm </v>
<v Speaker 1>tower your square and demanded Mubarak </v>

114
00:06:29.361 --> 00:06:31.430
<v Speaker 1>stepped down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After 29 years</v>

115
00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.630
<v Speaker 5>inspired by a popular uprising in </v>
<v Speaker 5>Tunisia,</v>

116
00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:35.493
<v Speaker 5>thousands of Egyptians took to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>streets demanding the alto of president </v>

117
00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:39.683
<v Speaker 5>postnatal.</v>

118
00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:42.430
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>800 years of history.</v>

119
00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:46.083
<v Speaker 1>You can see how Egypt has just a how it </v>
<v Speaker 1>moved from a tribal state to assault in </v>

120
00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:50.253
<v Speaker 1>it to a kingdom to republic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see in Egypt the weight of </v>

121
00:06:53.261 --> 00:06:54.094
<v Speaker 1>Middle Eastern history as it tries to </v>
<v Speaker 1>crash on the shore of freedom and </v>

122
00:06:57.371 --> 00:06:58.204
<v Speaker 1>democracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can also see that their history </v>

123
00:06:59.261 --> 00:07:00.094
<v Speaker 1>is one of blood and ferment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lit exclusively by military leaders and </v>

124
00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:06.880
<v Speaker 1>always in flow well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the military who has control,</v>

125
00:07:06.881 --> 00:07:08.150
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the interim leaders,</v>

126
00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.500
<v Speaker 1>a Supreme Council of Twenty generals </v>
<v Speaker 1>postpones,</v>

127
00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:15.280
<v Speaker 1>a civilian rule government to the dismay</v>
<v Speaker 1>of many protests begin again.</v>

128
00:07:15.281 --> 00:07:17.830
<v Speaker 1>Dozens have been killed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the council and apologizes,</v>

129
00:07:17.831 --> 00:07:18.664
<v Speaker 1>but it falls on deaf ears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Monday saw the start of a long process </v>

130
00:07:21.641 --> 00:07:22.474
<v Speaker 1>of parliamentary elections,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which won't deliver a new president </v>

131
00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:27.580
<v Speaker 1>until mid to late 2012.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the meantime,</v>

132
00:07:27.581 --> 00:07:30.130
<v Speaker 1>the counsel stays in charge who will </v>
<v Speaker 1>step forward.</v>

133
00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:30.993
<v Speaker 1>The Muslim Brotherhood made legal again </v>
<v Speaker 1>after 57 years and sure to be a big </v>

134
00:07:34.091 --> 00:07:36.250
<v Speaker 1>winner in the first round of </v>
<v Speaker 1>parliamentary election.</v>

135
00:07:36.251 --> 00:07:38.230
<v Speaker 1>Will it be leftists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>revolutionaries,</v>

136
00:07:38.231 --> 00:07:39.064
<v Speaker 1>or just successes and Mu Bar?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody really knows how it's all going </v>

137
00:07:41.211 --> 00:07:42.044
<v Speaker 1>to turn out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe this is the most important </v>

138
00:07:43.781 --> 00:07:44.614
<v Speaker 1>statistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's how much 40 percent of Egypt makes </v>

139
00:07:48.071 --> 00:07:49.930
<v Speaker 1>per day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Egyptians want change,</v>

140
00:07:49.931 --> 00:07:54.931
<v Speaker 1>but they need stability and with change </v>
<v Speaker 1>there is no stability and with stability</v>

141
00:07:55.151 --> 00:07:55.984
<v Speaker 1>there is little change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do they find democracy and who will </v>

142
00:07:59.801 --> 00:08:04.801
<v Speaker 1>be the stewards of revolution in Egypt </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the movement and the movement called</v>

143
00:08:04.931 --> 00:08:09.931
<v Speaker 1>the three officers led by Muhammad and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the movement and the movement called the</v>

144
00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:11.300
<v Speaker 1>Free Officers led by Mohammad.</v>
