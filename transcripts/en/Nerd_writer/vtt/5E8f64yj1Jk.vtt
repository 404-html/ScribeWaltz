1
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:25.080
<v Speaker 1>Rembrandt's</v>

2
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.520
<v Speaker 2>painting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Nightwatch,</v>

3
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:27.563
<v Speaker 2>perhaps the most famous work of his long</v>
<v Speaker 2>career and have the Dutch golden age </v>

4
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.960
<v Speaker 2>generally is not set at night and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>not really a watch either.</v>

5
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:37.763
<v Speaker 2>It's a painting of the militia company </v>
<v Speaker 2>of district two under the command of </v>

6
00:00:40.861 --> 00:00:42.990
<v Speaker 2>captain fronds Bennett,</v>
<v Speaker 2>coke,</v>

7
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.710
<v Speaker 2>which is also it's true law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>original name.</v>

8
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.790
<v Speaker 2>Essentially later after years of varnish</v>
<v Speaker 2>and low light dark in the canvas,</v>

9
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.840
<v Speaker 2>someone called it the night watch and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuck because,</v>

10
00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.820
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what it looked like.</v>

11
00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.340
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the nightwatch was meant to be a daytime</v>

12
00:00:59.341 --> 00:01:02.640
<v Speaker 2>scene just like other portraits of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Dutch civic guards,</v>

13
00:01:02.641 --> 00:01:03.474
<v Speaker 2>groups of well to do Amsterdam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Citizens tasked with keeping the peace </v>

14
00:01:06.631 --> 00:01:10.710
<v Speaker 2>should threats come to the city walls </v>
<v Speaker 2>over the 16th and 17th centuries,</v>

15
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:11.603
<v Speaker 2>civic guard portraits became a genre all</v>
<v Speaker 2>its own and is painting in the </v>

16
00:01:15.361 --> 00:01:18.150
<v Speaker 2>Netherlands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>moved away from spiritual subject matter</v>

17
00:01:18.151 --> 00:01:20.160
<v Speaker 2>and toward the secular artists.</v>

18
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.910
<v Speaker 2>Welcomed commission work from these </v>
<v Speaker 2>wealthy guilds because they wanted large</v>

19
00:01:23.911 --> 00:01:26.550
<v Speaker 2>group portraits again and again and </v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

20
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.073
<v Speaker 2>But if you want to know why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rembrandt's is the only civic garde </v>

21
00:01:30.661 --> 00:01:33.390
<v Speaker 2>painting that makes it into most school </v>
<v Speaker 2>curriculums.</v>

22
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.883
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to do is look at it </v>

23
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.210
<v Speaker 2>commissioned to do what all the others </v>
<v Speaker 2>had done.</v>

24
00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.440
<v Speaker 2>Show off the paying members of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>guild.</v>

25
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.540
<v Speaker 2>Rembrandt takes the genre and explodes </v>
<v Speaker 2>his vision through it.</v>

26
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.340
<v Speaker 2>The Night Watch is an eruption of </v>
<v Speaker 2>action,</v>

27
00:01:47.341 --> 00:01:52.341
<v Speaker 2>shadow and light with drama that's more </v>
<v Speaker 2>suited to a biblical or historical epic.</v>

28
00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.680
<v Speaker 2>Not 17 guys from peace time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amsterdam.</v>

29
00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.970
<v Speaker 2>No offense to captain coke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what makes the nightwatch so great?</v>

30
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.983
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what hits me right away is the balance </v>

31
00:02:02.611 --> 00:02:05.460
<v Speaker 2>that rembrandt strikes between chaos and</v>
<v Speaker 2>unity.</v>

32
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.460
<v Speaker 2>He clearly wanted to create a canvas </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a lot of movement,</v>

33
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.770
<v Speaker 2>but the challenge was how to make that </v>
<v Speaker 2>movement.</v>

34
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:11.603
<v Speaker 2>People lurching in different directions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>performing a variety of actions cohere </v>

35
00:02:15.211 --> 00:02:17.640
<v Speaker 2>into a unified whole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The keystone,</v>

36
00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:18.563
<v Speaker 2>the part of the painting that holds </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything in place or the dual figures </v>

37
00:02:21.721 --> 00:02:25.860
<v Speaker 2>of the captain and his lieutenant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rest of the portrait moves away from</v>

38
00:02:25.861 --> 00:02:27.330
<v Speaker 2>them diagonally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Indeed,</v>

39
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.100
<v Speaker 2>rembrandt places these lines directly </v>
<v Speaker 2>onto the painting in the form of weapons</v>

40
00:02:32.101 --> 00:02:32.934
<v Speaker 2>and Poles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the effect isn't just two </v>

41
00:02:34.711 --> 00:02:35.544
<v Speaker 2>dimensional and maybe the most striking </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing is the captain and the lieutenant </v>

42
00:02:38.431 --> 00:02:41.370
<v Speaker 2>seemed to be emerging from the picture </v>
<v Speaker 2>plane,</v>

43
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.950
<v Speaker 2>the captain's hand ordering the company </v>
<v Speaker 2>forward.</v>

44
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.100
<v Speaker 2>It's as if you could grab it and pull </v>
<v Speaker 2>them out of the frame.</v>

45
00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.310
<v Speaker 2>The lieutenants part is in the spirit </v>
<v Speaker 2>like weapon he's holding in.</v>

46
00:02:50.311 --> 00:02:54.870
<v Speaker 2>His left hand is so expertly foreshorten</v>
<v Speaker 2>feels like it could cut you.</v>

47
00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.063
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>based on the angle and the placement of </v>

48
00:02:57.511 --> 00:02:58.344
<v Speaker 2>the weapon shadow on the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the partisan is beyond the picture </v>

49
00:03:01.541 --> 00:03:03.730
<v Speaker 2>plane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or at least it should be.</v>

50
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.990
<v Speaker 2>Another trick rembrandt uses to achieve </v>
<v Speaker 2>this effect is one that will be familiar</v>

51
00:03:07.991 --> 00:03:08.824
<v Speaker 2>to filmmakers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The figures in the front are painted </v>

52
00:03:10.781 --> 00:03:11.614
<v Speaker 2>with detail and clarity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While the further back you go in the </v>

53
00:03:14.141 --> 00:03:14.974
<v Speaker 2>composition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the softer and hazier thing seemed to </v>

54
00:03:17.231 --> 00:03:18.064
<v Speaker 2>get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rembrandt is mimicking depth of field </v>

55
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.003
<v Speaker 2>and optical phenomenon that can make </v>
<v Speaker 2>objects in focus pop from their </v>

56
00:03:24.611 --> 00:03:25.444
<v Speaker 2>backgrounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of these effects were carefully </v>

57
00:03:27.101 --> 00:03:31.180
<v Speaker 2>planned by Rembrandt to anchor the </v>
<v Speaker 2>composition around the central figures.</v>

58
00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.830
<v Speaker 2>The longer you look at the night watch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more meaning emerges from this burst</v>

59
00:03:35.831 --> 00:03:37.780
<v Speaker 2>of frenetic energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

60
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:38.673
<v Speaker 2>the three men with guns are performing </v>
<v Speaker 2>the three main actions associated with </v>

61
00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:43.493
<v Speaker 2>the archibus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the primary weapon of this particular </v>

62
00:03:45.701 --> 00:03:46.534
<v Speaker 2>guilt loading,</v>
<v Speaker 2>firing and blowing clear the gunpowder </v>

63
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.010
<v Speaker 2>pen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

64
00:03:51.011 --> 00:03:51.844
<v Speaker 2>these poses match almost perfectly </v>
<v Speaker 2>engravings from a book called exercise </v>

65
00:03:55.361 --> 00:03:56.194
<v Speaker 2>of arms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a famous manual on how to use weaponry </v>

66
00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.340
<v Speaker 2>released at the beginning of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>century.</v>

67
00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.210
<v Speaker 2>This particular civic guard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Clo veneers is signaled again in the</v>

68
00:04:04.211 --> 00:04:06.410
<v Speaker 2>chicken that's hanging from the young </v>
<v Speaker 2>girls waste.</v>

69
00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.310
<v Speaker 2>A similar claw was on the Clo veneers </v>
<v Speaker 2>code of arms,</v>

70
00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.430
<v Speaker 2>and while the captain's hand points </v>
<v Speaker 2>toward the viewer,</v>

71
00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.670
<v Speaker 2>it shadow points toward his companies </v>
<v Speaker 2>function.</v>

72
00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.230
<v Speaker 2>It's cradling the emblem of Amsterdam </v>
<v Speaker 2>Elian and three crosses.</v>

73
00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.380
<v Speaker 2>The clo veneers were supposed to protect</v>
<v Speaker 2>the city.</v>

74
00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.140
<v Speaker 2>The other notable feature is Rembrandt's</v>
<v Speaker 2>famous use of Couto,</v>

75
00:04:27.141 --> 00:04:30.640
<v Speaker 2>sqirl and effective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deeply contrasted light and shadow.</v>

76
00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.690
<v Speaker 2>It's a technique that first came to </v>
<v Speaker 2>prominence in the work of Caravaggio who</v>

77
00:04:34.691 --> 00:04:35.524
<v Speaker 2>used sharp contrasts and harsh lighting </v>
<v Speaker 2>to create intense drama in his </v>

78
00:04:38.951 --> 00:04:39.784
<v Speaker 2>paintings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The rembrandt was clearly interested in </v>

79
00:04:41.261 --> 00:04:42.730
<v Speaker 2>this technique,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for him,</v>

80
00:04:42.731 --> 00:04:43.564
<v Speaker 2>light served a somewhat different </v>
<v Speaker 2>purpose and not only as remembrance </v>

81
00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:47.483
<v Speaker 2>cattle softer than Caravaggio's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the light in his painting seems to </v>

82
00:04:51.131 --> 00:04:55.120
<v Speaker 2>have a numinous quality as if once it </v>
<v Speaker 2>touches the subjects,</v>

83
00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:56.590
<v Speaker 2>it becomes a part of them.</v>

84
00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:57.663
<v Speaker 2>If we turn back to the nightwatch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can see that rembrandt uses </v>

85
00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.830
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] to single out two key </v>
<v Speaker 2>figures,</v>

86
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.770
<v Speaker 2>the lieutenant and the girl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as we've already seen,</v>

87
00:05:05.771 --> 00:05:09.550
<v Speaker 2>both these figures contained symbols </v>
<v Speaker 2>that call back to the group itself.</v>

88
00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:10.563
<v Speaker 2>In the case of the lieutenant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's as if the captain's orders to </v>

89
00:05:12.521 --> 00:05:16.690
<v Speaker 2>assemble are illuminating his second in </v>
<v Speaker 2>command and from his light.</v>

90
00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.970
<v Speaker 2>The rest of the company is to fall in </v>
<v Speaker 2>line,</v>

91
00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:20.643
<v Speaker 2>and yet compositionally the two light </v>
<v Speaker 2>had figures almost serve the opposite </v>

92
00:05:24.221 --> 00:05:26.290
<v Speaker 2>purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Instead of unifying the company,</v>

93
00:05:26.291 --> 00:05:27.124
<v Speaker 2>the girl and the lieutenant seem </v>
<v Speaker 2>strategically placed to break up the </v>

94
00:05:30.251 --> 00:05:33.160
<v Speaker 2>individual men in the canvas flanking </v>
<v Speaker 2>the captain.</v>

95
00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:34.023
<v Speaker 2>They almost isolate him and thanks to </v>
<v Speaker 2>their contrast were drawn to the </v>

96
00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:37.993
<v Speaker 2>haphazard actions and faces of each man </v>
<v Speaker 2>all seeming to be lost in their own </v>

97
00:05:43.391 --> 00:05:44.224
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The night watches capturing the moments </v>

98
00:05:46.091 --> 00:05:49.120
<v Speaker 2>before the company sets out to its </v>
<v Speaker 2>collective purpose,</v>

99
00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.750
<v Speaker 2>but the painting almost makes us doubt </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they'll ever get there.</v>

100
00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:53.703
<v Speaker 2>Indeed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the time this painting was made in </v>

101
00:05:54.641 --> 00:05:55.474
<v Speaker 2>16,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Forty two nearing the victorious of the </v>

102
00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.273
<v Speaker 2>80 years war with the Spanish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Dutch were prosperous in civic </v>

103
00:06:02.181 --> 00:06:05.330
<v Speaker 2>guards were more ceremonial than </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessary.</v>

104
00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:06.583
<v Speaker 2>At a certain point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these companies became clubs for men to </v>

105
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:12.410
<v Speaker 2>play with their weapons and chip in for </v>
<v Speaker 2>fancy group portraits.</v>

106
00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:13.693
<v Speaker 2>It's not inconceivable that Rembrandt </v>
<v Speaker 2>may have been secretly making fun of </v>

107
00:06:16.881 --> 00:06:19.850
<v Speaker 2>them a little bit in this his most </v>
<v Speaker 2>famous painting,</v>

108
00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.850
<v Speaker 2>but that's the tension that the painter </v>
<v Speaker 2>captures in the night.</v>

109
00:06:22.851 --> 00:06:23.684
<v Speaker 2>Watch and endless jockeying between </v>
<v Speaker 2>light and dark nation and individual </v>

110
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:28.783
<v Speaker 2>chaos and order.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rembrandt could never let either one of </v>

111
00:06:31.851 --> 00:06:36.020
<v Speaker 2>those elemental forces went out in his </v>
<v Speaker 2>composition because if he did,</v>

112
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:37.063
<v Speaker 2>he lose the most essential thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing he was striving for and </v>

113
00:06:40.341 --> 00:06:41.174
<v Speaker 2>achieves within effect that makes this </v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the greatest paintings of all </v>

114
00:06:45.261 --> 00:06:46.094
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

115
00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.150
<v Speaker 2>Hey everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank you so much for watching.</v>

116
00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.850
<v Speaker 2>This episode was brought to you by Nord </v>
