1
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:04.980
<v Speaker 1>Coffee on a Tuesday and blog 24 and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody out there who's new welcome,</v>

2
00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:16.963
<v Speaker 1>so there wasn't this Soviet astronomer </v>
<v Speaker 1>called Nikolai car and he devised a </v>

3
00:00:20.601 --> 00:00:24.530
<v Speaker 1>system for measuring the energy needs of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a civilization on a very broad scale.</v>

4
00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.530
<v Speaker 1>It's called the car dealership scale and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it breaks down like this.</v>

5
00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:28.603
<v Speaker 1>A type one civilization is one that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>harness the full power of the planet on </v>

6
00:00:32.271 --> 00:00:33.104
<v Speaker 1>which it lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to say a civilization that </v>

7
00:00:34.821 --> 00:00:36.500
<v Speaker 1>utilizes all the solar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wind,</v>

8
00:00:36.501 --> 00:00:37.450
<v Speaker 1>nuclear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>etc.</v>

9
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.650
<v Speaker 1>Energy available to it on its home </v>
<v Speaker 1>planet.</v>

10
00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.570
<v Speaker 1>This is mEasured using earth as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>

11
00:00:41.571 --> 00:00:45.560
<v Speaker 1>as 10 to the 16th was a type one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Civilization can control the weather,</v>

12
00:00:45.561 --> 00:00:48.890
<v Speaker 1>it can manipulate basic matter and its </v>
<v Speaker 1>economy is global.</v>

13
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.873
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a type two civilization is one that has </v>

14
00:00:51.561 --> 00:00:54.200
<v Speaker 1>harnessed all the power from its nearest</v>
<v Speaker 1>store.</v>

15
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.063
<v Speaker 1>When the planet's energy output becomes </v>
<v Speaker 1>an equal to the needs of the </v>

16
00:00:57.231 --> 00:00:58.064
<v Speaker 1>civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that civilization will go right to the </v>

17
00:00:59.871 --> 00:01:00.704
<v Speaker 1>source and devise some method for </v>
<v Speaker 1>collecting the energy from that giant </v>

18
00:01:03.771 --> 00:01:04.604
<v Speaker 1>fusion reactor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is his parents start measured </v>

19
00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:07.453
<v Speaker 1>using the son as an example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as four times 10 to the 26th was a type </v>

20
00:01:11.391 --> 00:01:11.510
<v Speaker 1>two.</v>

21
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.700
<v Speaker 1>Civilization is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for all intents and purposes,</v>

22
00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.620
<v Speaker 1>invincible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was nothing known to physics,</v>

23
00:01:15.621 --> 00:01:17.870
<v Speaker 1>not even a super nova,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which can destroy it.</v>

24
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.913
<v Speaker 1>Now a type three civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is where it gets cool is one </v>

25
00:01:22.041 --> 00:01:25.160
<v Speaker 1>that has harnessed all the power of its </v>
<v Speaker 1>home galaxy,</v>

26
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.190
<v Speaker 1>which is to say all the many billions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>stars that comprise it,</v>

27
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.173
<v Speaker 1>sort of like the galactic republic from </v>
<v Speaker 1>star wars using our milky way as an </v>

28
00:01:32.661 --> 00:01:34.970
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is measured at four times 10 to the</v>

29
00:01:34.971 --> 00:01:35.804
<v Speaker 1>37th watts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there's us human beings from </v>

30
00:01:37.881 --> 00:01:40.040
<v Speaker 1>the planet earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are drum roll please.</v>

31
00:01:40.041 --> 00:01:40.874
<v Speaker 1>A Type zero civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means that we still get the </v>

32
00:01:43.491 --> 00:01:44.324
<v Speaker 1>majority of our energy from dead plants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long will it take for us to become </v>

33
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.760
<v Speaker 1>type one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michio kaku,</v>

34
00:01:49.761 --> 00:01:50.594
<v Speaker 1>a physicist who you might've seen on </v>
<v Speaker 1>every single science channel show has </v>

35
00:01:52.581 --> 00:01:53.414
<v Speaker 1>pretty good that we'll get there </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere in the next 100 to 200 years </v>

36
00:01:55.911 --> 00:01:59.300
<v Speaker 1>and type two and the next house and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>see the beginnings of that now,</v>

37
00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:00.163
<v Speaker 1>but there's a problem here and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's out there in the stars in our </v>

38
00:02:03.171 --> 00:02:04.490
<v Speaker 1>galaxy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the milky way galaxy,</v>

39
00:02:04.491 --> 00:02:07.820
<v Speaker 1>which has somewhere between 200 to 400 </v>
<v Speaker 1>billion stars in it.</v>

40
00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:09.043
<v Speaker 1>Common sense seems to tell us that there</v>
<v Speaker 1>has to be intelligent life out there </v>

41
00:02:12.231 --> 00:02:13.610
<v Speaker 1>somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most likely intelligent life,</v>

42
00:02:13.611 --> 00:02:14.444
<v Speaker 1>which is way more advanced than us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know that any civilization type two </v>

43
00:02:17.841 --> 00:02:21.290
<v Speaker 1>or above would have an energy signature </v>
<v Speaker 1>detectable by our instruments,</v>

44
00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.320
<v Speaker 1>so the question has to be why don't we </v>
<v Speaker 1>see them?</v>

45
00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.120
<v Speaker 1>There are many possible answers to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>

46
00:02:26.121 --> 00:02:29.600
<v Speaker 1>but the one I find most compelling is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the one most applicable to our situation</v>

47
00:02:29.601 --> 00:02:30.434
<v Speaker 1>here on her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every intelligent species will go </v>

48
00:02:32.151 --> 00:02:36.020
<v Speaker 1>through the process of discovering the </v>
<v Speaker 1>elements on the periodic table,</v>

49
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.480
<v Speaker 1>the work systematically from hydrogen on</v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

50
00:02:38.481 --> 00:02:39.314
<v Speaker 1>and eventually they'll come to </v>
<v Speaker 1>discovering element 92 known to us as </v>

51
00:02:43.311 --> 00:02:44.144
<v Speaker 1>uranium.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a very special on earth that </v>

52
00:02:46.701 --> 00:02:49.270
<v Speaker 1>appears in a few isotopes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most commonly uranium two,</v>

53
00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.173
<v Speaker 1>38.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now this consists of 99 point two </v>

54
00:02:51.771 --> 00:02:53.540
<v Speaker 1>percent of all the uranium that's out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

55
00:02:53.541 --> 00:02:56.540
<v Speaker 1>but there's also uranium 235.</v>

56
00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.650
<v Speaker 1>Now this consists of point seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two percent of that's out there,</v>

57
00:02:59.651 --> 00:03:02.470
<v Speaker 1>but it's much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much more valuable.</v>

58
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.333
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you bombard uranium to 35 with a </v>

59
00:03:05.201 --> 00:03:08.020
<v Speaker 1>free new truck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you make uranium to 36,</v>

60
00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:08.854
<v Speaker 1>a highly unstable adam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so unstable that it has to split into </v>

61
00:03:12.431 --> 00:03:14.380
<v Speaker 1>two lighter elements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>krypton and barium,</v>

62
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.233
<v Speaker 1>as well as three more free neutrons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>this process is called vision and it </v>

63
00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:22.240
<v Speaker 1>releases a whole lot of energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much energy?</v>

64
00:03:22.241 --> 00:03:23.074
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a handy equation for figuring </v>

65
00:03:24.011 --> 00:03:24.844
<v Speaker 1>that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's simply the mass times the speed of </v>

66
00:03:26.321 --> 00:03:27.154
<v Speaker 1>light square thing is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very tricky to separate that </v>

67
00:03:29.051 --> 00:03:33.880
<v Speaker 1>uranium 235 from the uranium 238 takes a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of time and a lot of money,</v>

68
00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.013
<v Speaker 1>but if you can do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that remaining uranium to 35 is called </v>

69
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.520
<v Speaker 1>enriched uranium,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you have a good amount of it,</v>

70
00:03:39.521 --> 00:03:40.354
<v Speaker 1>well then you've really hit the jackpot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember those three free neutrons </v>

71
00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:45.340
<v Speaker 1>coming off the original uranium to 36,</v>
<v Speaker 1>adam?</v>

72
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.353
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to whiz away and bombard </v>

73
00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.000
<v Speaker 1>other uranium 2:35</v>
<v Speaker 1>adams,</v>

74
00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.863
<v Speaker 1>turning them into 2:36</v>
<v Speaker 1>is which then split apart again and </v>

75
00:03:52.481 --> 00:03:53.314
<v Speaker 1>release three free neutrons each.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you can either control the speed of </v>

76
00:03:56.051 --> 00:03:59.200
<v Speaker 1>this chain reaction if you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>utilize the power of or something like a</v>

77
00:03:59.201 --> 00:04:00.034
<v Speaker 1>city or you can just let the reaction go</v>
<v Speaker 1>as fast as it once and the result of </v>

78
00:04:03.251 --> 00:04:04.084
<v Speaker 1>this</v>

79
00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:11.383
<v Speaker 1>on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Only the riChest and smartest countries </v>

80
00:04:12.651 --> 00:04:13.484
<v Speaker 1>have been able to develop a nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 1>weapon because of the tediousness of </v>

81
00:04:15.681 --> 00:04:16.514
<v Speaker 1>enriching uranium.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But just last month it was discovered </v>

82
00:04:18.651 --> 00:04:19.484
<v Speaker 1>that the country of Iran has begun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That process of enrichment and </v>

83
00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:23.503
<v Speaker 1>successfully maybe many people want Iran</v>
<v Speaker 1>to stop enriching for fear that they're </v>

84
00:04:26.991 --> 00:04:29.540
<v Speaker 1>building a bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iran says that's not what it's doing and</v>

85
00:04:29.541 --> 00:04:31.940
<v Speaker 1>that it won't stop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people don't seem to believe them.</v>

86
00:04:31.941 --> 00:04:34.220
<v Speaker 1>Though I don't have the slightest idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>why.</v>

87
00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.010
<v Speaker 1>It's all very tense right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let me.</v>

88
00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:38.780
<v Speaker 1>Let me bring this back to my point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

89
00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.680
<v Speaker 1>when an intelligent species learns to </v>
<v Speaker 1>enrich uranium element 92,</v>

90
00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.790
<v Speaker 1>it all of a sudden gains the power to </v>
<v Speaker 1>totally destroy its own environment.</v>

91
00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:48.680
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to destroy itself.</v>

92
00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:50.233
<v Speaker 1>Maybe this is the reason why we don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>see or hear from other intelligent life </v>

93
00:04:53.301 --> 00:04:54.134
<v Speaker 1>in the cosmos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's because the most critical </v>

94
00:04:55.791 --> 00:04:56.624
<v Speaker 1>time for any civilization is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>transition between type zero and type </v>

95
00:05:00.861 --> 00:05:01.040
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

96
00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.873
<v Speaker 1>A type one civilization is global,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means that its economy is global </v>

97
00:05:04.791 --> 00:05:07.430
<v Speaker 1>as well as a large part of its culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has to be tolerant,</v>

98
00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:08.690
<v Speaker 1>communicative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pluralistic.</v>

99
00:05:08.691 --> 00:05:11.600
<v Speaker 1>It has to rise above the monocultural,</v>
<v Speaker 1>totalitarian,</v>

100
00:05:11.601 --> 00:05:14.120
<v Speaker 1>often theistic belief in ultimate </v>
<v Speaker 1>conformity.</v>

101
00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.250
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has to be peaceful.</v>

102
00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:17.713
<v Speaker 1>We can see that though we possess a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of characteristics of a type one </v>

103
00:05:20.181 --> 00:05:23.030
<v Speaker 1>civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not quite there yet.</v>

104
00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.073
<v Speaker 1>Totalitarianism still has it sanctuary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It may very well be the case that there </v>

105
00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:29.353
<v Speaker 1>are dozens of earth like planets out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there with extinct intelligent </v>

106
00:05:32.091 --> 00:05:32.924
<v Speaker 1>civilizations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Civilizations that failed to negotiate </v>

107
00:05:35.211 --> 00:05:38.090
<v Speaker 1>that transition between type zero and </v>
<v Speaker 1>type one.</v>

108
00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:43.300
<v Speaker 1>Civilizations caught up in their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>weaknesses and if we make it and one day</v>

109
00:05:44.361 --> 00:05:48.860
<v Speaker 1>far from now are flying around the </v>
<v Speaker 1>galaxy and come across one that didn't.</v>

110
00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:50.533
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt to me that will feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>the profound a sense of pity because we </v>

111
00:05:55.071 --> 00:05:59.480
<v Speaker 1>would know that with a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge and empathy and courage,</v>

112
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:02.930
<v Speaker 1>it could've gone the other way.</v>
