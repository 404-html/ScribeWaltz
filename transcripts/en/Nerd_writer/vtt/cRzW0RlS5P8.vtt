00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:02.993
<v Speaker 1>Recently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to decide whether or not I </v>

2
00:00:04.291 --> 00:00:05.124
<v Speaker 1>should buy a wide angle lens for this </v>
<v Speaker 1>camera and in order to make that </v>

3
00:00:08.071 --> 00:00:11.310
<v Speaker 1>decision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I employed the timeless technique of the</v>

4
00:00:11.311 --> 00:00:14.400
<v Speaker 1>pros and cons list.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the process of making that list,</v>

5
00:00:14.401 --> 00:00:16.350
<v Speaker 1>I happened to discover that the pros,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cons,</v>

6
00:00:16.351 --> 00:00:17.184
<v Speaker 1>lists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>technique,</v>

7
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.080
<v Speaker 1>something so simple that it had to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>used by a human since time immemorial is</v>

8
00:00:22.081 --> 00:00:22.914
<v Speaker 1>actually a relatively recent invention </v>
<v Speaker 1>by none other than our stupidly </v>

9
00:00:26.851 --> 00:00:30.180
<v Speaker 1>accomplished forefather Benjamin </v>
<v Speaker 1>Franklin to somewhat hilarious.</v>

10
00:00:30.181 --> 00:00:32.850
<v Speaker 1>Letter to Joseph priestly in 17,</v>
<v Speaker 1>72,</v>

11
00:00:32.851 --> 00:00:33.684
<v Speaker 1>Franklin explains it thusly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My way is to divide half a sheet of </v>

12
00:00:37.171 --> 00:00:38.004
<v Speaker 1>paper by a line into two columns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>writing over the one pro and over the </v>

13
00:00:41.011 --> 00:00:44.010
<v Speaker 1>other con than during three or four days</v>
<v Speaker 1>consideration.</v>

14
00:00:44.011 --> 00:00:45.720
<v Speaker 1>I put down under different head shots,</v>

15
00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:46.663
<v Speaker 2>hints of the different motives that at </v>
<v Speaker 2>different times occur to me for or </v>

16
00:00:49.011 --> 00:00:51.260
<v Speaker 2>against the law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I had that got them all together in</v>

17
00:00:51.261 --> 00:00:52.094
<v Speaker 2>one view,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I endeavored to estimate their </v>

18
00:00:52.701 --> 00:00:57.701
<v Speaker 2>respective whites.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to act accordingly.</v>

19
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:03.480
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Franklin may merely</v>

20
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.910
<v Speaker 1>have been the first person to write this</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea down,</v>

21
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.810
<v Speaker 1>not the first to use it when it got me </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about concepts that appeared to</v>

22
00:01:09.811 --> 00:01:10.644
<v Speaker 1>me as timeless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but which only seemed so because I'm </v>

23
00:01:13.051 --> 00:01:16.980
<v Speaker 1>trapped in this particular place at this</v>
<v Speaker 1>particular time.</v>

24
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.390
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the number zero,</v>

25
00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.400
<v Speaker 1>we use it every day in conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>none,</v>

26
00:01:20.401 --> 00:01:21.061
<v Speaker 1>Nada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zip,</v>

27
00:01:21.061 --> 00:01:22.350
<v Speaker 1>Zilch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>zero goose egg,</v>

28
00:01:22.351 --> 00:01:27.090
<v Speaker 1>but as a concept zero took many </v>
<v Speaker 1>centuries to develop and a number of our</v>

29
00:01:27.091 --> 00:01:27.924
<v Speaker 1>greatest minds to comprehend fully the </v>
<v Speaker 1>best mathematicians of ancient Greece </v>

30
00:01:31.321 --> 00:01:34.890
<v Speaker 1>didn't even have a name for zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't like it does for us.</v>

31
00:01:34.891 --> 00:01:38.310
<v Speaker 1>Serve as a place holder for writing big </v>
<v Speaker 1>numbers.</v>

32
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.790
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't until 6:50</v>
<v Speaker 1>add that Indian mathematician,</v>

33
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:42.773
<v Speaker 1>Brahma gooped finally formalized how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>reach zero through addition and </v>

34
00:01:46.201 --> 00:01:47.034
<v Speaker 1>subtraction that the concept took shape </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it wasn't fully understood for </v>

35
00:01:50.131 --> 00:01:50.964
<v Speaker 1>another thousand years when Newton and </v>
<v Speaker 1>live nets invented calculus and what it </v>

36
00:01:54.421 --> 00:01:57.930
<v Speaker 1>actually means to divide by zero from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Matt.</v>

37
00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:58.763
<v Speaker 1>Totally normal segue to sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>though heterosexuality is something we </v>

38
00:02:01.531 --> 00:02:05.010
<v Speaker 1>invoke to an almost ridiculous degree in</v>
<v Speaker 1>contemporary society.</v>

39
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.933
<v Speaker 1>The term actually dates to the mid 19th </v>
<v Speaker 1>century and a letter written by </v>

40
00:02:08.731 --> 00:02:12.360
<v Speaker 1>Austro-hungarian journalist Carl curt </v>
<v Speaker 1>bent in the letter carrier,</v>

41
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.233
<v Speaker 1>Benny coins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the terms for Hetero and homosexuality </v>

42
00:02:15.571 --> 00:02:19.500
<v Speaker 1>as a way to suggest that there's no </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy between the two ways of life,</v>

43
00:02:19.501 --> 00:02:22.950
<v Speaker 1>that they're just different inborn </v>
<v Speaker 1>expressions of sexuality.</v>

44
00:02:22.951 --> 00:02:23.784
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't until later in the 19th </v>
<v Speaker 1>century that psychiatrists and </v>

45
00:02:26.101 --> 00:02:26.934
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalysts established </v>
<v Speaker 1>heterosexuality as a synonym for normal </v>

46
00:02:30.631 --> 00:02:33.420
<v Speaker 1>and homosexuality is somehow deviant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before that,</v>

47
00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.710
<v Speaker 1>people were persecuted for a certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual acts like sodomy or pedophilia.</v>

48
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.600
<v Speaker 1>The creation and coopting of these terms</v>
<v Speaker 1>enabled the persecution of orientation.</v>

49
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.970
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about the idea of ambition?</v>

50
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.620
<v Speaker 1>Surely a timeless concept for admirable </v>
<v Speaker 1>striving up the social ladder.</v>

51
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.390
<v Speaker 1>Actually ambition is only as old as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>social ladder is.</v>

52
00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.253
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't until the Middle Ages that </v>
<v Speaker 1>social mobility became a viable option </v>

53
00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.513
<v Speaker 1>for members of society before the 16th </v>
<v Speaker 1>century social position was ordained by </v>

54
00:03:03.611 --> 00:03:06.220
<v Speaker 1>God and classes were her medically </v>
<v Speaker 1>sealed part.</v>

55
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.130
<v Speaker 1>Nobody not born there could get in or </v>
<v Speaker 1>even entertain.</v>

56
00:03:09.131 --> 00:03:12.700
<v Speaker 1>The idea of doing so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ambition comes from the Latin and beer,</v>

57
00:03:12.701 --> 00:03:17.701
<v Speaker 1>which means to go around specifically to</v>
<v Speaker 1>go around canvassing for votes as in the</v>

58
00:03:17.741 --> 00:03:19.540
<v Speaker 1>old Roman system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In ancient times,</v>

59
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.630
<v Speaker 1>it was always used as a negative term </v>
<v Speaker 1>group together with pride and vainglory,</v>

60
00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.160
<v Speaker 1>but when the middle ages ended and </v>
<v Speaker 1>modernity,</v>

61
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.023
<v Speaker 1>dawn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the English word ambition enters common </v>

62
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:31.263
<v Speaker 1>usage as something positive to </v>
<v Speaker 1>legitimize and reinforce the social </v>

63
00:03:35.351 --> 00:03:36.184
<v Speaker 1>climbing of the new world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fast forward to today and it's </v>

64
00:03:38.171 --> 00:03:42.190
<v Speaker 1>impossible to imagine office spaces </v>
<v Speaker 1>without posters like this.</v>

65
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:43.263
<v Speaker 1>Finally childhood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a timeless archetype of purity and </v>

66
00:03:46.661 --> 00:03:49.660
<v Speaker 1>innocence known in the late 19th and </v>
<v Speaker 1>20th century.</v>

67
00:03:49.661 --> 00:03:50.494
<v Speaker 1>Children were employed as laborers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>their work was seen as crucial to </v>

68
00:03:53.651 --> 00:03:55.390
<v Speaker 1>contributing to the family income.</v>

69
00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:56.313
<v Speaker 1>It was only after the passing of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>number of child labor laws that </v>

70
00:03:58.781 --> 00:03:59.614
<v Speaker 1>prohibited them from work that society </v>
<v Speaker 1>began treating children in the way that </v>

71
00:04:02.711 --> 00:04:05.530
<v Speaker 1>we think of now as explicitly </v>
<v Speaker 1>noncommercial,</v>

72
00:04:05.531 --> 00:04:09.190
<v Speaker 1>as sacred,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imbued with an almost religious pure.</v>

73
00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.820
<v Speaker 1>Instead of being individuals meant to </v>
<v Speaker 1>secure the future for their parents.</v>

74
00:04:12.821 --> 00:04:13.654
<v Speaker 1>The roles were reversed and parents were</v>
<v Speaker 1>obliged to protect children from the </v>

75
00:04:16.931 --> 00:04:17.764
<v Speaker 1>harsh realities of adult life and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>children's ceased to be productive </v>

76
00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:21.663
<v Speaker 1>economic forces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They reemerged in the economy as </v>

77
00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:25.203
<v Speaker 1>consumers and the sentimental space they</v>
<v Speaker 1>occupied was aggressively </v>

78
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.360
<v Speaker 1>commercialized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before this shift in the culture,</v>

79
00:04:31.361 --> 00:04:32.194
<v Speaker 1>the concept of childhood was much less.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hello to the point that even the death </v>

80
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.150
<v Speaker 1>of a child was received with a certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of aloofness and detachment,</v>

81
00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.013
<v Speaker 1>zealous or quotes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a contemporary man on this subject to </v>

82
00:04:42.791 --> 00:04:46.150
<v Speaker 1>lose a child when first brought into </v>
<v Speaker 1>life is very hard,</v>

83
00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:48.460
<v Speaker 1>but it is a tax we must pay.</v>

84
00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:49.323
<v Speaker 1>It's an attitude that's hard to imagine </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a time like ours when the most </v>

85
00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:53.673
<v Speaker 1>horrific and emotionally painful event </v>
<v Speaker 1>of recent memory was the death of 20 </v>

86
00:04:57.671 --> 00:05:00.820
<v Speaker 1>young children in Newtown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Connecticut in 2012.</v>

87
00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.160
<v Speaker 1>The majority of those who died today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're children,</v>

88
00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:09.070
<v Speaker 1>a beautiful little kids between the ages</v>
<v Speaker 1>of five and 10 years old.</v>

89
00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm not making a value judgment on any </v>
<v Speaker 1>of these shifts in our culture.</v>

90
00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.973
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's extremely humbling to know that my </v>

91
00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.980
<v Speaker 1>conception of human nature is merely a </v>
<v Speaker 1>reflection of a moment in history.</v>

92
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.933
<v Speaker 1>Many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if not all of these things are </v>

93
00:05:23.081 --> 00:05:23.914
<v Speaker 1>historical accidents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not some great fulfillment of the way </v>

94
00:05:26.771 --> 00:05:31.771
<v Speaker 1>humanity was always going to advance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They express the wills of individuals in</v>

95
00:05:31.871 --> 00:05:35.320
<v Speaker 1>meshed in moralities as blind to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>past as we are.</v>

96
00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:36.453
<v Speaker 1>The more we understand that fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more benevolent our own blind push </v>

97
00:05:40.121 --> 00:05:41.530
<v Speaker 1>forward will be.</v>

98

101
00:05:50.231 --> 00:05:51.064
<v Speaker 1>One on concept of love and one on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>concept of logic and I'll put the links </v>
