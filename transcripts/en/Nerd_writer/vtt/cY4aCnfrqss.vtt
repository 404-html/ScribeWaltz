00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:06.113
<v Speaker 1>Since around 2008 when the DSLR </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution full frame sensors in the </v>

2
00:00:09.931 --> 00:00:13.020
<v Speaker 1>hands of amateur filmmakers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>videographers,</v>

3
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.153
<v Speaker 1>super shallow depth of field has become </v>
<v Speaker 1>something of a cliche in indie </v>

4
00:00:17.461 --> 00:00:19.500
<v Speaker 1>filmmaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For a lot of filmmakers,</v>

5
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:20.573
<v Speaker 1>myself included.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This effect was used not just as a tool </v>

6
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.760
<v Speaker 1>but as a crutch to achieve that </v>
<v Speaker 1>cinematic look.</v>

7
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.910
<v Speaker 1>These days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super shallow focus is everywhere.</v>

8
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.330
<v Speaker 1>It's a fashion more than a technique,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's really,</v>

9
00:00:33.331 --> 00:00:36.660
<v Speaker 1>really cool to see an episodic show like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the handmaid's tale,</v>

10
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:37.733
<v Speaker 1>incorporate the effect in a systematic </v>
<v Speaker 1>way as a motif of its visual language </v>

11
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.910
<v Speaker 1>and the director of the first three </v>
<v Speaker 1>episodes of the show,</v>

12
00:00:44.911 --> 00:00:47.490
<v Speaker 1>the director who set the tone is Reed </v>
<v Speaker 1>Morano,</v>

13
00:00:47.491 --> 00:00:51.060
<v Speaker 1>a former cinematographer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She in her own DP for this project,</v>

14
00:00:51.061 --> 00:00:51.894
<v Speaker 1>Colin Watkinson created an extremely </v>
<v Speaker 1>concentrated aesthetic one that is </v>

15
00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.110
<v Speaker 1>beautiful and terrifying at the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

16
00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:59.303
<v Speaker 1>To capture the dystopian world of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gilliad meant choosing the right camera </v>

17
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.660
<v Speaker 1>and the right lenses.</v>

18
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:04.793
<v Speaker 1>Marano shot on the Arri Alexa Minis in </v>
<v Speaker 1>four K and use lenses that open all the </v>

19
00:01:08.881 --> 00:01:12.390
<v Speaker 1>way up to apertures of one point three </v>
<v Speaker 1>and one point four,</v>

20
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.253
<v Speaker 1>which means your depth of field is going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be razor thin and everything outside </v>

21
00:01:17.161 --> 00:01:20.640
<v Speaker 1>of that field is going to be blown out </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a pretty uniform blur.</v>

22
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.060
<v Speaker 1>This shallow focus serves the story in </v>
<v Speaker 1>three ways.</v>

23
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.610
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to capture the main character's point of</v>

24
00:01:26.611 --> 00:01:31.611
<v Speaker 1>view offered played by Elizabeth Moss is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a handmade in the republic of Gilead,</v>

25
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:32.723
<v Speaker 1>a theocratic and totalitarian state that</v>
<v Speaker 1>has overtaken America in which women no </v>

26
00:01:36.181 --> 00:01:37.014
<v Speaker 1>longer have any rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Handmaids are the last woman who can </v>

27
00:01:39.631 --> 00:01:40.464
<v Speaker 1>still have children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rest of society being largely </v>

28
00:01:42.361 --> 00:01:46.440
<v Speaker 1>sterile and they're forced to bear </v>
<v Speaker 1>children for leaders of the regime,</v>

29
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.230
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't always like this before </v>
<v Speaker 1>the revolution off.</v>

30
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:50.083
<v Speaker 1>Fred lived in the America of our time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the story of the handmaid's tale is </v>

31
00:01:53.551 --> 00:01:57.960
<v Speaker 1>really the story of the transition </v>
<v Speaker 1>between America and Gilliad told through</v>

32
00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.600
<v Speaker 1>the experience of offered to die.</v>

33
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.560
<v Speaker 1>Listen to that horror read in Watkinson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>focus on the face.</v>

34
00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.780
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to remember a show that relied</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much on one extreme closeup,</v>

35
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:09.623
<v Speaker 1>but Elizabeth Moss is definitely up to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the task with a camera mere inches from </v>

36
00:02:13.741 --> 00:02:14.574
<v Speaker 1>her nose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The filmmakers combined a wide 28 </v>

37
00:02:16.591 --> 00:02:20.640
<v Speaker 1>millimeter Zeiss Lens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>used only for these shots with a shallow</v>

38
00:02:20.641 --> 00:02:24.660
<v Speaker 1>depth of field to create intense </v>
<v Speaker 1>intimacy with her bonnet on.</v>

39
00:02:24.661 --> 00:02:27.240
<v Speaker 1>It's almost as if we're under a blanket </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a character.</v>

40
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.420
<v Speaker 1>The shallow depth of field extreme </v>
<v Speaker 1>closeups are an effective way to get the</v>

41
00:02:30.421 --> 00:02:32.320
<v Speaker 1>audience to identify with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>offer it,</v>

42
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:33.503
<v Speaker 1>but they also point to an important </v>
<v Speaker 1>theme that as a slave in an </v>

43
00:02:36.391 --> 00:02:39.330
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where your physical being is effectively</v>

44
00:02:39.331 --> 00:02:43.830
<v Speaker 1>controlled by someone else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're only agency is mental.</v>

45
00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.860
<v Speaker 1>The mind is where you have to retreat to</v>
<v Speaker 1>escape,</v>

46
00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.510
<v Speaker 1>to plan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to remember.</v>

47
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.440
<v Speaker 1>It's only a thin plane of focus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's still yours.</v>

48
00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.280
<v Speaker 1>Second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shallow focus is used to help create the</v>

49
00:02:56.281 --> 00:02:57.114
<v Speaker 1>world of Gilead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unlike many dystopias you see in film </v>

50
00:02:59.471 --> 00:03:00.304
<v Speaker 1>and TV,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Giliad is not a post apocalyptic world </v>

51
00:03:02.231 --> 00:03:03.064
<v Speaker 1>of rubble and ruin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually the opposite and </v>

52
00:03:05.241 --> 00:03:06.074
<v Speaker 1>meticulously manicured New England full </v>
<v Speaker 1>of sunlight and green foliage reading </v>

53
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.923
<v Speaker 1>Watkinson site.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kubrick as an inspiration and they echo </v>

54
00:03:12.851 --> 00:03:13.684
<v Speaker 1>a lot of his one point perspective </v>
<v Speaker 1>framings and definitely capture the </v>

55
00:03:16.601 --> 00:03:19.270
<v Speaker 1>creepiness of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for the women of Gilliad,</v>

56
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.110
<v Speaker 1>what's notable about this world is how </v>
<v Speaker 1>little they know about it.</v>

57
00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:24.283
<v Speaker 1>Think of all the knowledge that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>accessible to you through the Internet </v>

58
00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.170
<v Speaker 1>and Gilly ad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Women are not only prohibited from going</v>

59
00:03:29.171 --> 00:03:31.330
<v Speaker 1>online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're prohibited from reading.</v>

60
00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:32.223
<v Speaker 1>Anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Result is a perspective that's </v>

61
00:03:33.911 --> 00:03:34.744
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily narrow and shallow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Depth of field captures this perfectly </v>

62
00:03:38.081 --> 00:03:42.220
<v Speaker 1>because it literally narrows the visual </v>
<v Speaker 1>information in Focus.</v>

63
00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.950
<v Speaker 1>The handmaid's tale is constructed in </v>
<v Speaker 1>fragments.</v>

64
00:03:44.951 --> 00:03:49.000
<v Speaker 1>You have America and you have Gilliad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the show gives you pieces in between</v>

65
00:03:49.001 --> 00:03:51.100
<v Speaker 1>the two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but never the full timeline.</v>

66
00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:52.293
<v Speaker 1>This is in part because the show's </v>
<v Speaker 1>primary characters don't have the full </v>

67
00:03:54.461 --> 00:03:57.130
<v Speaker 1>timeline themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this brutal new world,</v>

68
00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.250
<v Speaker 1>or at least the conditions that made it </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible snuck up on them.</v>

69
00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.173
<v Speaker 1>I have to let you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean it came out of </v>

70
00:04:03.461 --> 00:04:05.410
<v Speaker 1>nowhere that they aren't somehow </v>
<v Speaker 1>connected.</v>

71
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:06.603
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though reading Watkinson adopted </v>

72
00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.980
<v Speaker 1>more handheld verite style for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>flashbacks,</v>

73
00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.110
<v Speaker 1>the shallow focus remains and they do </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

74
00:04:14.111 --> 00:04:14.944
<v Speaker 1>I think to suggest that both worlds </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffer from problems of limited </v>

75
00:04:17.801 --> 00:04:21.820
<v Speaker 1>perspective in Gilead perspective is </v>
<v Speaker 1>limited by force,</v>

76
00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.570
<v Speaker 1>but in our world perspective is limited </v>
<v Speaker 1>by choice.</v>

77
00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.750
<v Speaker 1>We keep our heads down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes glued to our screens,</v>

78
00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.823
<v Speaker 1>stuck in our echo chambers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While the blurry world around us </v>

79
00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:33.363
<v Speaker 1>changes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It brings home a vital message that our </v>

80
00:04:35.531 --> 00:04:36.364
<v Speaker 1>rights are not guaranteed by the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We fight for them and have to protect </v>

81
00:04:40.151 --> 00:04:40.984
<v Speaker 1>them everyday because it can be taken </v>
<v Speaker 1>away from us if we don't pay attention </v>

82
00:04:44.291 --> 00:04:45.124
<v Speaker 1>to the world.</v>

83
00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.360
<v Speaker 1>Beyond our focus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone likes shallow depth of field.</v>

84
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.400
<v Speaker 1>It's beautiful and because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful,</v>

85
00:04:51.401 --> 00:04:54.280
<v Speaker 1>everyone uses it to make their work look</v>
<v Speaker 1>better,</v>

86
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.260
<v Speaker 1>more professional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more cinematic,</v>

87
00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.120
<v Speaker 1>and as a result,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we get used to seeing it.</v>

88
00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:59.553
<v Speaker 1>When I watch the handmaid's tale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was amazed at how much the depth of </v>

89
00:05:02.321 --> 00:05:07.060
<v Speaker 1>field influence my feelings about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>characters and the world and the story.</v>

90
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.930
<v Speaker 1>It's just rare that you see this device </v>
<v Speaker 1>used with such purpose,</v>

91
00:05:10.931 --> 00:05:14.650
<v Speaker 1>so methodically and so effectively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it really is effective.</v>

92
00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:16.113
<v Speaker 1>If you don't believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>binge watch a few episodes of the </v>

93
00:05:18.281 --> 00:05:21.430
<v Speaker 1>handmaid's tale than go outside at </v>
<v Speaker 1>guarantee.</v>

94
00:05:21.431 --> 00:05:24.850
<v Speaker 1>You'll have a new found respect for how </v>
<v Speaker 1>much there is to see.</v>

95
00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:35.000
<v Speaker 2>One of the questions I</v>

96
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.960
<v Speaker 1>get asked the most is what software I </v>
<v Speaker 1>use to make these videos to edit.</v>

97
00:05:38.961 --> 00:05:39.794
<v Speaker 1>I use final cut pro 10 and since 10 is </v>
<v Speaker 1>so different from the version of the </v>

98
00:05:43.101 --> 00:05:43.934
<v Speaker 1>program that came before it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I depended a lot on online videos to </v>

99
00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:47.803
<v Speaker 1>teach me the new features that these </v>
<v Speaker 1>days you can pretty much teach yourself </v>

100
00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.160
<v Speaker 1>anything this way and skillshare is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect way to do it at skillshare is an</v>
