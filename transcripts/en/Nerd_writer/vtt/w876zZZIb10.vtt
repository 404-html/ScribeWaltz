1
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.590
<v Speaker 1>It's likely that by now you've heard </v>
<v Speaker 1>about movie pass,</v>

2
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.730
<v Speaker 1>the subscription service that allows you</v>
<v Speaker 1>to see one movie per day in theaters for</v>

3
00:00:11.731 --> 00:00:13.140
<v Speaker 1>$9,</v>
<v Speaker 1>95 a month,</v>

4
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.430
<v Speaker 1>except you can't see it will be more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than once.</v>

5
00:00:14.431 --> 00:00:15.264
<v Speaker 1>You have to be a hundred yards from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>theater to book the ticket and during </v>

6
00:00:16.201 --> 00:00:17.520
<v Speaker 1>certain times you have to pay a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>extra,</v>

7
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.000
<v Speaker 1>but despite all that movie pass is still</v>
<v Speaker 1>a pretty good deal.</v>

8
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:21.953
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the deal might be too good for moving </v>

9
00:00:23.701 --> 00:00:24.534
<v Speaker 1>past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just as you've probably heard about </v>

10
00:00:25.381 --> 00:00:26.214
<v Speaker 1>movie pass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've probably also heard the company </v>

11
00:00:27.541 --> 00:00:30.690
<v Speaker 1>is losing money faster than a Tarantino.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Henchmen loses blood.</v>

12
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.280
<v Speaker 1>The problem is simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Movie past charges nine 95 a month,</v>

13
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.700
<v Speaker 1>and the average movie ticket and America</v>
<v Speaker 1>costs $9 and sixteen cents.</v>

14
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.270
<v Speaker 1>When you see a movie with movie pass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they pay the full price of the ticket as</v>

15
00:00:42.271 --> 00:00:44.700
<v Speaker 1>if they were buying a normal ticket for </v>
<v Speaker 1>a friend.</v>

16
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.070
<v Speaker 1>That means if you see just two movies a </v>
<v Speaker 1>month,</v>

17
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.790
<v Speaker 1>movie passes losing double what a gains </v>
<v Speaker 1>from you more.</v>

18
00:00:50.791 --> 00:00:53.580
<v Speaker 1>If you're buying in a city where ticket </v>
<v Speaker 1>prices are more expensive,</v>

19
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:54.743
<v Speaker 1>multiply that by $3,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million friends and you can see why </v>

20
00:00:57.121 --> 00:00:57.954
<v Speaker 1>movie pass is in a lot of trouble </v>
<v Speaker 1>financially according to the best </v>

21
00:01:00.571 --> 00:01:01.404
<v Speaker 1>estimates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The average movie pass subscriber sees </v>

22
00:01:02.701 --> 00:01:03.534
<v Speaker 1>about one point five movies a month and </v>
<v Speaker 1>even though that's not three movies or </v>

23
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.003
<v Speaker 1>even to the numbers are still lopsided </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that point five of a movie is </v>

24
00:01:11.851 --> 00:01:13.890
<v Speaker 1>bleeding them dry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In 2017,</v>

25
00:01:13.891 --> 00:01:14.724
<v Speaker 1>the company that owns movie pass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Helios and Matheson lost a $150 million </v>

26
00:01:18.451 --> 00:01:19.284
<v Speaker 1>dollars and in May the company revealed </v>
<v Speaker 1>in an sec filing that it's losing 21 </v>

27
00:01:22.981 --> 00:01:27.120
<v Speaker 1>point $7,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>per month on average at that time and at</v>

28
00:01:27.121 --> 00:01:27.954
<v Speaker 1>that rate they only had enough cash </v>
<v Speaker 1>available to stay solvent for two more </v>

29
00:01:30.811 --> 00:01:31.644
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>

30
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.760
<v Speaker 1>It's two months later now and well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the website still works,</v>

31
00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.820
<v Speaker 1>so that's a good sign.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're consistently losing money as a</v>

32
00:01:38.821 --> 00:01:39.654
<v Speaker 1>business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's only one way to stay afloat by </v>

33
00:01:41.881 --> 00:01:42.714
<v Speaker 1>finding investors to give you money in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the hope that some day you'll be </v>

34
00:01:45.391 --> 00:01:46.224
<v Speaker 1>profitable in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Investors investing in spotify or uber </v>

35
00:01:49.771 --> 00:01:50.604
<v Speaker 1>or dropbox or blue apron,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all companies that have yet to become </v>

36
00:01:53.671 --> 00:01:54.504
<v Speaker 1>profitable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact of the 108 companies that went </v>

37
00:01:56.731 --> 00:02:00.480
<v Speaker 1>public in 2017,</v>
<v Speaker 1>over three quarters weren't profitable.</v>

38
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.930
<v Speaker 1>Now not all unprofitable companies are </v>
<v Speaker 1>created equal.</v>

39
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.913
<v Speaker 1>Amazon was unprofitable for years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it had the revenue so it was just </v>

40
00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:11.790
<v Speaker 1>putting them back into investments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the case of movie pass,</v>

41
00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.380
<v Speaker 1>the revenue just isn't enough to pay for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the costs and movie past says it,</v>

42
00:02:16.381 --> 00:02:17.214
<v Speaker 1>understands this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says it always knew it was going to </v>

43
00:02:19.441 --> 00:02:23.760
<v Speaker 1>lose money on its path to acquiring more</v>
<v Speaker 1>subscribers and greater market share.</v>

44
00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.113
<v Speaker 1>And to be fair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the growth of the company has been </v>

45
00:02:26.611 --> 00:02:30.030
<v Speaker 1>impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Last August movie pass only had 20,000</v>

46
00:02:30.031 --> 00:02:33.330
<v Speaker 1>subscribers when they lowered their </v>
<v Speaker 1>price to $10 a month,</v>

47
00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:34.493
<v Speaker 1>almost a year later and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>approaching $3 million with projections </v>

48
00:02:37.411 --> 00:02:39.300
<v Speaker 1>of up to 5 million by the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

49
00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.273
<v Speaker 1>The theory behind the price drop and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>reason they haven't yet raised it </v>

50
00:02:43.081 --> 00:02:43.914
<v Speaker 1>substantially to stem their losses is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's supposed to attract the 51 </v>

51
00:02:47.431 --> 00:02:51.510
<v Speaker 1>percent of movie goers who only see </v>
<v Speaker 1>about three to six movies a year.</v>

52
00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.720
<v Speaker 1>People who might pass on $20 or even $15</v>
<v Speaker 1>but can't resist 10 these people,</v>

53
00:02:58.171 --> 00:02:59.004
<v Speaker 1>the theory goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll bring the average movie per </v>

54
00:03:00.701 --> 00:03:01.534
<v Speaker 1>subscriber down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but movie pass needs to look for cash </v>

55
00:03:04.121 --> 00:03:04.954
<v Speaker 1>and other places to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The original idea was that it could use </v>

56
00:03:06.881 --> 00:03:07.714
<v Speaker 1>the app to track the movie going habits </v>
<v Speaker 1>of its users and sell that data to </v>

57
00:03:11.381 --> 00:03:15.400
<v Speaker 1>studios for targeted advertising and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>restaurants nearby the theater who could</v>

58
00:03:15.401 --> 00:03:17.770
<v Speaker 1>advertise to customers when they're in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the area.</v>

59
00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:19.213
<v Speaker 1>Movie pass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that eventually if it can grow </v>

60
00:03:21.251 --> 00:03:24.070
<v Speaker 1>enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can negotiate a percentage of the new</v>

61
00:03:24.071 --> 00:03:24.904
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's bringing two theaters and the </v>

62
00:03:26.321 --> 00:03:29.050
<v Speaker 1>surrounding stores.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It thinks that it could potentially even</v>

63
00:03:29.051 --> 00:03:33.610
<v Speaker 1>get a slice of a theaters only real </v>
<v Speaker 1>moneymaker concessions.</v>

64
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.953
<v Speaker 1>Let's see what the CEO of America's </v>
<v Speaker 1>largest theater chain has to say about </v>

65
00:03:37.211 --> 00:03:37.930
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

66
00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:38.763
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely no intention,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no intention of sharing any of our </v>

67
00:03:41.361 --> 00:03:44.160
<v Speaker 2>admissions revenue or concession.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Terrific Bitch.</v>

68
00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.510
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I added that last part.</v>

69
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:47.620
<v Speaker 2>It was good to get to it.</v>

70
00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.630
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are a lot of forces at work in the</v>

71
00:03:50.631 --> 00:03:54.850
<v Speaker 1>movie theater ecosystem and movie pass </v>
<v Speaker 1>is laying them all bear.</v>

72
00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.963
<v Speaker 1>People are seeing fewer movies overall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so theater chains have been raising </v>

73
00:03:59.571 --> 00:04:00.404
<v Speaker 1>ticket prices and higher ticket prices </v>
<v Speaker 1>means people see fewer movies still and </v>

74
00:04:03.861 --> 00:04:07.910
<v Speaker 1>don't take chances on what they do see </v>
<v Speaker 1>at theaters have it hard as it is.</v>

75
00:04:07.911 --> 00:04:11.810
<v Speaker 1>Most ticket revenues get kicked back to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the studios who leveraged their power to</v>

76
00:04:11.811 --> 00:04:15.470
<v Speaker 1>get even more percentage and now here </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes the subscription service,</v>

77
00:04:15.471 --> 00:04:16.304
<v Speaker 1>the valuing the price of a ticket in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>minds of consumers asking for a cut of </v>

78
00:04:19.551 --> 00:04:24.551
<v Speaker 1>concessions and yet movie pass is </v>
<v Speaker 1>bringing them business.</v>

79
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.630
<v Speaker 1>It's users are taking chances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

80
00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.580
<v Speaker 1>seeing movies on a whim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

81
00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.550
<v Speaker 1>it's bringing more people to the movies </v>
<v Speaker 1>more often.</v>

82
00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:35.590
<v Speaker 1>It's just not bringing enough people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not yet.</v>

83
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.810
<v Speaker 1>The studios don't want to pay for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>data.</v>

84
00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.933
<v Speaker 1>The theaters don't want to cut them in </v>
<v Speaker 1>and movie pass subscribers are just </v>

85
00:04:44.491 --> 00:04:45.324
<v Speaker 1>seeing too many movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there's a size at which this would </v>

86
00:04:48.211 --> 00:04:49.044
<v Speaker 1>all change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 million subscribers maybe or 50 </v>

87
00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:52.890
<v Speaker 1>million or 100,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

88
00:04:52.891 --> 00:04:57.891
<v Speaker 1>but it's a race now can move you past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get to that critical size before it runs</v>

89
00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.290
<v Speaker 1>completely out of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess we'll see.</v>

90
00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.040
<v Speaker 1>Until then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is genuinely one of the best deals in</v>

91
00:05:05.041 --> 00:05:05.874
<v Speaker 1>town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something I thought I'd never see a </v>

92
00:05:08.191 --> 00:05:13.050
<v Speaker 1>bunch of rich investors taking millions </v>
<v Speaker 1>of people out to the movies.</v>

93
00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.760
<v Speaker 1>Everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you so much for watching.</v>

94
00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:22.320
<v Speaker 1>This episode was brought to you by </v>
<v Speaker 1>skillshare and online learning community</v>

95
00:05:22.321 --> 00:05:24.690
<v Speaker 1>for creators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but more than 18,000</v>

96
00:05:24.691 --> 00:05:28.260
<v Speaker 1>classes and everything from graphic </v>
<v Speaker 1>design to film editing,</v>

97
00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.250
<v Speaker 1>finance it security.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

98
00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:32.093
<v Speaker 1>when I learned photoshop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I learned it through this mishmash of </v>

99
00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.480
<v Speaker 1>disconnected youtube videos and I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>the process would have gone a lot faster</v>

100
00:05:39.481 --> 00:05:40.314
<v Speaker 1>if there was a class dedicated to </v>
<v Speaker 1>teaching me everything about that </v>

101
00:05:43.051 --> 00:05:43.884
<v Speaker 1>program in a systematic way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Learning new skills is really valuable </v>

102
00:05:46.951 --> 00:05:48.810
<v Speaker 1>to me because whenever I learn a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>skill,</v>

103
00:05:48.811 --> 00:05:51.990
<v Speaker 1>it's like a bunch of new ideas are </v>
<v Speaker 1>suddenly unlocked in my head.</v>

104
00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:54.510
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what can I do with this and that.</v>
