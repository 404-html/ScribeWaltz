<v Speaker 1>You got there?</v>

12
00:00:44.591 --> 00:00:45.424
<v Speaker 1>Read this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My friend is a 78 Marillo by foreign </v>

13
00:00:47.121 --> 00:00:47.954
<v Speaker 1>Yantais,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same urine vintage drunk by the </v>

14
00:00:49.571 --> 00:00:51.490
<v Speaker 1>senior associates at the blackstone </v>
<v Speaker 1>group.</v>

15
00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.780
<v Speaker 1>The same year they acquired the Howard </v>
<v Speaker 1>Johnson Franchise in 1990.</v>

16
00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.330
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is vintage.</v>

17
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually drinking a very special </v>
<v Speaker 1>bottle myself here.</v>

18
00:01:01.941 --> 00:01:02.774
<v Speaker 1>Read this is an 89 Pino noir by wooden </v>
<v Speaker 1>head sent over by the board of Bain </v>

19
00:01:07.451 --> 00:01:08.284
<v Speaker 1>capital.</v>

20
00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.480
<v Speaker 1>This vintage they drank when staples </v>
<v Speaker 1>inc.</v>

21
00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:11.493
<v Speaker 1>One of their very first investments went</v>
<v Speaker 1>public and it's also the wind that they </v>

22
00:01:14.561 --> 00:01:18.100
<v Speaker 1>were drunk off of their gourds on when </v>
<v Speaker 1>this picture was taken.</v>

23
00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.730
<v Speaker 1>TOnight I want to talk about one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexiest figures in the nation.</v>

24
00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.430
<v Speaker 1>If not the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you know who I mean and no,</v>

25
00:01:24.431 --> 00:01:27.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm not talking about beyonce or mr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Circumstance over there.</v>

26
00:01:27.671 --> 00:01:31.720
<v Speaker 1>This is a man with both public sector </v>
<v Speaker 1>and private sector experience.</v>

27
00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.420
<v Speaker 1>you guessed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am talking about the one the only,</v>

28
00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.030
<v Speaker 1>the irresistibly erotic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mitt romney.</v>

29
00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.893
<v Speaker 1>Mr romney is currently in contention for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the republican presidential nominee </v>

30
00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.880
<v Speaker 1>touted by many as the front runner in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that race,</v>

31
00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.923
<v Speaker 1>though a week turn out in South Carolina</v>
<v Speaker 1>has many predicting that this might </v>

32
00:01:47.411 --> 00:01:48.244
<v Speaker 1>become a stripped to the waist mud </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestling match between mit and the </v>

33
00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.640
<v Speaker 1>improbably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>New bile newt gingrich.</v>

34
00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.480
<v Speaker 1>Ladies I know I'm not the only one who </v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to see these two sands shirt,</v>

35
00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.000
<v Speaker 1>but politics is the bag of a different </v>
<v Speaker 1>show here.</v>

36
00:02:01.001 --> 00:02:04.360
<v Speaker 1>We are more interested in what mr romney</v>
<v Speaker 1>did before he set his sights on the oval</v>

37
00:02:04.361 --> 00:02:05.194
<v Speaker 1>office and since the man himself puts </v>
<v Speaker 1>his experience at bain capital at the </v>

38
00:02:07.541 --> 00:02:08.374
<v Speaker 1>forefront of his campaign,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's only appropriate that we </v>

39
00:02:10.091 --> 00:02:12.700
<v Speaker 1>explain and analyze that experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think,</v>

40
00:02:12.701 --> 00:02:14.440
<v Speaker 1>reggie?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm drunk now.</v>

41
00:02:14.441 --> 00:02:15.274
<v Speaker 1>Those who know me know that there are a </v>
<v Speaker 1>few things that make my cherries tingle </v>

42
00:02:18.671 --> 00:02:22.540
<v Speaker 1>more intensely than private equity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what is private equity after all?</v>

43
00:02:22.541 --> 00:02:23.374
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>private equity isn't asset class </v>

44
00:02:24.191 --> 00:02:27.280
<v Speaker 1>consisting of equity securities in </v>
<v Speaker 1>operating companies,</v>

45
00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.580
<v Speaker 1>not publicly traded on a stock exchange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

46
00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:31.151
<v Speaker 1>nerdwriter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

47
00:02:31.151 --> 00:02:33.220
<v Speaker 1>that sounds like a lot of gobbledygook </v>
<v Speaker 1>to me.</v>

48
00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.971
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reggie,</v>

49
00:02:33.971 --> 00:02:35.800
<v Speaker 1>I think I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I get your point here.</v>

50
00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.100
<v Speaker 1>So private equity or pe used to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>called leveraged buyout or lbo.</v>

51
00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.063
<v Speaker 1>It's the practice by which a private </v>
<v Speaker 1>equity firm like bain capital uses a </v>

52
00:02:45.101 --> 00:02:45.934
<v Speaker 1>fund of money to buy out a small or </v>
<v Speaker 1>underperforming company to flip it for </v>

53
00:02:49.031 --> 00:02:50.670
<v Speaker 1>profit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like flip that house.</v>

54
00:02:50.671 --> 00:02:51.970
<v Speaker 1>You've seen that show?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that show.</v>

55
00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.863
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's say that you have a company </v>

56
00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.990
<v Speaker 1>that you want to sell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm a private equity firm.</v>

57
00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.270
<v Speaker 1>Now the price you put on your business </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

58
00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.133
<v Speaker 1>let's say $10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I'm going to do is raise 1 million </v>

59
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.270
<v Speaker 1>through my investors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the equity.</v>

60
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.880
<v Speaker 1>The other 9 million I'm going to borrow </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the bank.</v>

61
00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.650
<v Speaker 1>That's the leverage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

62
00:03:08.651 --> 00:03:09.484
<v Speaker 1>so now that I have the 10 million,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to buy out your company with </v>

63
00:03:12.041 --> 00:03:15.130
<v Speaker 1>$9,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>in debt in come in and try to streamline</v>

64
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.430
<v Speaker 1>all the aspects of that business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to make things more efficient.</v>

65
00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:19.930
<v Speaker 1>The layoff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unproductive.</v>

66
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.960
<v Speaker 1>Employees decrease overhead after five </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

67
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.220
<v Speaker 1>Let's say that I succeeded and now your </v>
<v Speaker 1>business is worth 20 million.</v>

68
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.600
<v Speaker 1>What I'm going to do is pay back the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bank,</v>

69
00:03:29.601 --> 00:03:30.434
<v Speaker 1>gets 9 million plus interest and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>split the rest between myself and the </v>

70
00:03:33.341 --> 00:03:34.174
<v Speaker 1>investors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the basic model of a leveraged </v>

71
00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.150
<v Speaker 1>buyout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How's that?</v>

72
00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.220
<v Speaker 1>So it looks like we have our first </v>
<v Speaker 1>caller here.</v>

73
00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.400
<v Speaker 1>Hello,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're on with the nerd writer.</v>

74
00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:46.453
<v Speaker 1>What is your question?</v>

75
00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm a long time and they love your show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

76
00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.100
<v Speaker 2>private equity is good or bad for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>economy seats.</v>

77
00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:57.293
<v Speaker 2>I think I won't be able to run this </v>
<v Speaker 2>building from the ground reconsidering </v>

78
00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:02.520
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't like to know what impact is.</v>

79
00:04:02.521 --> 00:04:04.010
<v Speaker 2>Industry as well.</v>

80
00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:05.710
<v Speaker 1>That's a great question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mary,</v>

81
00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.450
<v Speaker 1>and a tough one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See these days,</v>

82
00:04:07.451 --> 00:04:08.284
<v Speaker 1>romney presents himself as a job creator</v>
<v Speaker 1>recently saying we started a number of </v>

83
00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:15.850
<v Speaker 1>businesses for in particular created a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred and 20,000</v>

84
00:04:15.851 --> 00:04:18.280
<v Speaker 1>jobs as of today and there's no doubt </v>
<v Speaker 1>that private equity,</v>

85
00:04:18.281 --> 00:04:19.114
<v Speaker 1>especially venture capitalism and arm of</v>
<v Speaker 1>private equity firms invest in startup </v>

86
00:04:22.031 --> 00:04:23.950
<v Speaker 1>companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can create jobs,</v>

87
00:04:23.951 --> 00:04:28.060
<v Speaker 1>especially if you make a good bet like </v>
<v Speaker 1>romney and bain capital did with an idea</v>

88
00:04:28.061 --> 00:04:32.170
<v Speaker 1>for supermarket of office supplies which</v>
<v Speaker 1>later became staples.</v>

89
00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.790
<v Speaker 1>The problem is that streamlining cutting</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fat can often mean job losses and If</v>

90
00:04:36.791 --> 00:04:39.190
<v Speaker 1>the investment goes sour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well everybody loses.</v>

91
00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.940
<v Speaker 1>Even you married since your accountant </v>
<v Speaker 1>has invested some of your own funding.</v>

92
00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.823
<v Speaker 1>the deal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll hark capitalists like romney say </v>

93
00:04:46.361 --> 00:04:49.930
<v Speaker 1>that this is unnecessary risk of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>system and maybe it is,</v>

94
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.033
<v Speaker 1>but the problem with the term job </v>
<v Speaker 1>creators is that job creating is never </v>

95
00:04:54.011 --> 00:04:56.530
<v Speaker 1>the intended function of any of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>private equity firms.</v>

96
00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:57.633
<v Speaker 1>The purpose of bain taken directly from </v>
<v Speaker 1>its website is to deliver industry </v>

97
00:05:00.131 --> 00:05:04.420
<v Speaker 1>leading returns for its investors to </v>
<v Speaker 1>deliver the best returns.</v>

98
00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.420
<v Speaker 1>Job creation and job loss are a </v>
<v Speaker 1>byproduct,</v>

99
00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.580
<v Speaker 1>and this brings me to my central point.</v>

100
00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.873
<v Speaker 1>It was romney and his peers at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>inception of a revolutionary new </v>

101
00:05:21.551 --> 00:05:24.550
<v Speaker 1>industry called leveraged buyout or </v>
<v Speaker 1>private equity,</v>

102
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.370
<v Speaker 1>who helped to redefine american </v>
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>

103
00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:28.443
<v Speaker 1>See these men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a schism between the incentives of a </v>

104
00:05:30.201 --> 00:05:31.034
<v Speaker 1>company's owners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise known as shareholders and the </v>

105
00:05:32.591 --> 00:05:35.020
<v Speaker 1>incentives of its management.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To rectify this,</v>

106
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.020
<v Speaker 1>they acquired the companies themselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>via leveraged buyout,</v>

107
00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:39.363
<v Speaker 1>manage them themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and gave existing management and equity </v>

108
00:05:42.461 --> 00:05:45.130
<v Speaker 1>stake in the company in the form of </v>
<v Speaker 1>stock or stock options.</v>

109
00:05:45.131 --> 00:05:45.964
<v Speaker 1>This is the beginning of huge executive </v>
<v Speaker 1>compensation which gets the goat of </v>

110
00:05:50.951 --> 00:05:54.550
<v Speaker 1>those occupy protesters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The revolution is more clearly stated as</v>

111
00:05:54.551 --> 00:05:58.070
<v Speaker 1>the total alignment in the incentives of</v>
<v Speaker 1>accompanies owners,</v>

112
00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:59.143
<v Speaker 1>its board,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and its management around stock holder </v>

113
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:02.923
<v Speaker 1>value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For more on thIs as it relates to </v>

114
00:06:04.461 --> 00:06:06.950
<v Speaker 1>democracy and the recession,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see blog number four.</v>

115
00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.873
<v Speaker 1>You can find that link in the dubliner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm afraid that's all the time we have </v>

116
