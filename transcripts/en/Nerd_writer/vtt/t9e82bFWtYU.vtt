WEBVTT

1
00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.030
<v Speaker 1>As we race towards more sophisticated </v>
<v Speaker 1>forms of virtual reality,</v>

2
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:29.923
<v Speaker 1>it's worth considering the work of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Stanley Kubrick who spent his career </v>

3
00:00:33.291 --> 00:00:34.124
<v Speaker 1>probing and solving the questions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>immersive storytelling in ways that </v>

4
00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.270
<v Speaker 1>still remain unique more than any other </v>
<v Speaker 1>director.</v>

5
00:00:41.271 --> 00:00:46.271
<v Speaker 1>It's easy to imagine Kubrick's films as </v>
<v Speaker 1>worlds that we could explore as games or</v>

6
00:00:46.461 --> 00:00:51.461
<v Speaker 1>even virtual reality rides where we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>glide through narrative spaces intensely</v>

7
00:00:51.741 --> 00:00:53.630
<v Speaker 1>involved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but never in control.</v>

8
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.980
<v Speaker 1>This is because cooper was as much </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned with the way audiences engaged</v>

9
00:00:57.981 --> 00:01:01.310
<v Speaker 1>with his movies as he was with the ideas</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they were trying to convey.</v>

10
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:02.570
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for Kubrick,</v>

11
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.910
<v Speaker 1>these two things were inseparably </v>
<v Speaker 1>linked.</v>

12
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.940
<v Speaker 1>We often think of Cooper as a highly </v>
<v Speaker 1>stylized director,</v>

13
00:01:07.941 --> 00:01:08.774
<v Speaker 1>which he was a crucially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kubrick never lets us forget what the </v>

14
00:01:11.841 --> 00:01:12.674
<v Speaker 1>purpose of style actually is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Style is a lens that gives the viewer a </v>

15
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.620
<v Speaker 1>point of access to the material.</v>

16
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.380
<v Speaker 1>It's about the audience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the director.</v>

17
00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:24.080
<v Speaker 1>Something that new filmmakers should </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep in mind.</v>

18
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:25.063
<v Speaker 1>Today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to take a closer look at eyes </v>

19
00:01:26.271 --> 00:01:27.104
<v Speaker 1>wide shut Kubrick's final film and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways it immerses us in the story of </v>

20
00:01:30.741 --> 00:01:33.060
<v Speaker 1>Alice and especially Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bill Hartford,</v>

21
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.440
<v Speaker 1>a married couple going through a </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult time in their relationship,</v>

22
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:37.363
<v Speaker 1>and this isn't the first film to deal </v>
<v Speaker 1>with subjects of love or sex infidelity </v>

23
00:01:40.521 --> 00:01:41.354
<v Speaker 1>or even secret colts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Kubrick is intent on making our </v>

24
00:01:43.701 --> 00:01:46.340
<v Speaker 1>engagement with these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of a kind.</v>

25
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.290
<v Speaker 1>How does he do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

26
00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.213
<v Speaker 1>the first and most noticeable aspect of </v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes wide shut is definitely it's </v>

27
00:01:51.741 --> 00:01:52.574
<v Speaker 1>strange pacing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a slow moving on the level of </v>

28
00:01:55.461 --> 00:01:57.620
<v Speaker 1>narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but especially in the dialogue.</v>

29
00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.310
<v Speaker 1>Listening to Tom Cruise and Nicole </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kidman speak is like watching a dripping</v>

30
00:02:01.311 --> 00:02:02.144
<v Speaker 1>faucet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every word drops out of their mouths </v>

31
00:02:04.131 --> 00:02:07.560
<v Speaker 1>with the same lifeless rhythm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

32
00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.153
<v Speaker 1>women don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They basically just don't think like </v>

33
00:02:15.451 --> 00:02:18.060
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you see exhaustion in their faces and</v>

34
00:02:18.061 --> 00:02:18.894
<v Speaker 1>hear it in their voices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's because they really were </v>

35
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.983
<v Speaker 1>exhausted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kubrick made his actors to countless </v>

36
00:02:23.581 --> 00:02:24.414
<v Speaker 1>takes of every scene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including the ones where they had to </v>

37
00:02:26.251 --> 00:02:27.084
<v Speaker 1>break down and cry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the reason why eyes wide shut </v>

38
00:02:29.101 --> 00:02:31.950
<v Speaker 1>holds the Guinness record for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>longest movie shoot ever,</v>

39
00:02:31.951 --> 00:02:35.610
<v Speaker 1>but it's also the reason for these </v>
<v Speaker 1>utterly unique performances.</v>

40
00:02:35.611 --> 00:02:38.160
<v Speaker 1>Something beyond tired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beyond Giddy,</v>

41
00:02:38.161 --> 00:02:41.100
<v Speaker 1>that state of Dreamy Detachment Kubrick </v>
<v Speaker 1>was going for,</v>

42
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:47.773
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

43
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.350
<v Speaker 1>now this accomplishes two things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>

44
00:02:55.351 --> 00:02:57.600
<v Speaker 1>it adds to the hypnotic tone of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>film.</v>

45
00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.700
<v Speaker 1>Eyes wide shut is based a novella called</v>
<v Speaker 1>dream story,</v>

46
00:03:00.701 --> 00:03:01.534
<v Speaker 1>and the film certainly plays out like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dream or drugged up hallucination and </v>

47
00:03:04.961 --> 00:03:07.870
<v Speaker 1>second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the detached performances serve to block</v>

48
00:03:07.871 --> 00:03:11.140
<v Speaker 1>the lead characters from being targets </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the viewers.</v>

49
00:03:11.141 --> 00:03:11.974
<v Speaker 1>Empathy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes for a really interesting </v>

50
00:03:12.941 --> 00:03:13.774
<v Speaker 1>combination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me explain why from the moment bill </v>

51
00:03:15.701 --> 00:03:16.534
<v Speaker 1>leaves the house after Alice gives a </v>
<v Speaker 1>long wounding speech about her fantasy </v>

52
00:03:19.751 --> 00:03:20.584
<v Speaker 1>of sleeping with another man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The narrative conspires across a series </v>

53
00:03:23.651 --> 00:03:24.484
<v Speaker 1>of increasingly sexualized encounters to</v>
<v Speaker 1>deeply involve you in the unfolding </v>

54
00:03:28.091 --> 00:03:29.340
<v Speaker 1>events.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>

55
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.450
<v Speaker 1>the patient's daughter confesses her </v>
<v Speaker 1>love to bill.</v>

56
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:32.523
<v Speaker 1>Then bill hires a prostitute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then bill meets an old friend at a cafe </v>

57
00:03:35.531 --> 00:03:38.380
<v Speaker 1>who tells him about a secret sex party </v>
<v Speaker 1>later that night,</v>

58
00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:42.340
<v Speaker 1>then at a costume shop after hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bill witnesses the owners,</v>

59
00:03:42.341 --> 00:03:44.770
<v Speaker 1>young daughter sleeping with two </v>
<v Speaker 1>businessmen,</v>

60
00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.890
<v Speaker 1>and finally bill arrives at the sex </v>
<v Speaker 1>part,</v>

61
00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.800
<v Speaker 1>which is much more intense than he </v>
<v Speaker 1>anticipated.</v>

62
00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.430
<v Speaker 1>All this time you're experiencing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>night from the perspective of bill,</v>

63
00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.600
<v Speaker 1>but not from a position of empathy or </v>
<v Speaker 1>even sympathy for that matter.</v>

64
00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:59.733
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the viewer engages in what philosopher </v>

65
00:04:00.941 --> 00:04:01.774
<v Speaker 1>Alessandra Anelli calls experiential </v>
<v Speaker 1>identification in which the result of </v>

66
00:04:05.801 --> 00:04:06.634
<v Speaker 1>occupying bill's perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while not empathizing with him is that </v>

67
00:04:09.971 --> 00:04:10.804
<v Speaker 1>the perspective becomes your own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really as if the viewer is playing </v>

68
00:04:14.191 --> 00:04:16.920
<v Speaker 1>a virtual reality game of eyes wide </v>
<v Speaker 1>shut.</v>

69
00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.100
<v Speaker 1>This explains why we react to the orgy </v>
<v Speaker 1>sequence with such intensity,</v>

70
00:04:20.101 --> 00:04:24.000
<v Speaker 1>cooper leads us down beat by beat to </v>
<v Speaker 1>this moment with precision.</v>

71
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.073
<v Speaker 1>We've been pulled so far into the dream </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the simple act of bill putting on </v>

72
00:04:27.931 --> 00:04:31.620
<v Speaker 1>his mask or racing his identity </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely is for the viewer a moment of</v>

73
00:04:31.621 --> 00:04:34.320
<v Speaker 1>deeper immersion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the best vr</v>

74
00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.790
<v Speaker 1>from that moment on the experience of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the party is as much ours as it is,</v>

75
00:04:55.791 --> 00:04:56.624
<v Speaker 1>bills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are plenty of things that Kubrick </v>

76
00:04:57.921 --> 00:05:01.410
<v Speaker 1>does visually here to draw you in as he </v>
<v Speaker 1>does in his other movies,</v>

77
00:05:01.411 --> 00:05:04.740
<v Speaker 1>like using wide angle lenses or </v>
<v Speaker 1>switching to pov shots.</v>

78
00:05:04.741 --> 00:05:07.680
<v Speaker 1>Most of which are unfortunately too </v>
<v Speaker 1>explicit for me to show.</v>

79
00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:08.783
<v Speaker 1>But what sets eyes wide shut apart is </v>
<v Speaker 1>this systematic effort to swap you in </v>

80
00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.720
<v Speaker 1>for the protagonist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what the whole movie visuals,</v>

81
00:05:15.721 --> 00:05:18.750
<v Speaker 1>narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dialogue and character works together to</v>

82
00:05:18.751 --> 00:05:19.584
<v Speaker 1>accomplish the masked ball orgy scene </v>
<v Speaker 1>takes place exactly halfway through the </v>

83
00:05:22.711 --> 00:05:25.740
<v Speaker 1>movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're captured in its world for the</v>

84
00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.510
<v Speaker 1>remaining hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What exactly happened?</v>

85
00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:31.650
<v Speaker 1>How did you let yourself get in so deep?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're questions are the same as bills,</v>

86
00:05:31.651 --> 00:05:33.360
<v Speaker 1>and as the two of you attempt to piece </v>
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>

87
00:05:33.361 --> 00:05:35.430
<v Speaker 1>the answer is like a dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Half remembered.</v>

88
00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:36.713
<v Speaker 1>Nothing comes up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clear bill can't reach his patient's </v>

89
00:05:38.761 --> 00:05:39.570
<v Speaker 1>starter.</v>

90
00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.570
<v Speaker 1>He can't find his friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nick Knight and and when he goes back to</v>

91
00:05:42.571 --> 00:05:44.730
<v Speaker 1>the home of the prostitute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's gone.</v>

92
00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:47.640
<v Speaker 1>Even at the costume shop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things have completely changed.</v>

93
00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:51.060
<v Speaker 1>Nothing quite make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were going to call the police.</v>

94
00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.180
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things change.</v>

95
00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.073
<v Speaker 1>The information that you can piece </v>
<v Speaker 1>together tells a story that's dark and </v>

96
00:05:57.921 --> 00:05:59.510
<v Speaker 1>haunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I noticed Mr.</v>

97
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:04.600
<v Speaker 1>Nightingale had a bruise on his cheek </v>
<v Speaker 1>and to be perfectly honest,</v>

98
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.860
<v Speaker 1>I also thought you looked a bit scared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then at the end,</v>

99
00:06:08.861 --> 00:06:09.694
<v Speaker 1>Sydney Pollack suddenly appears again </v>
<v Speaker 1>mirroring his appearance at the </v>

100
00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:13.953
<v Speaker 1>beginning of the film as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>authoritative voice to offer an </v>

101
00:06:15.281 --> 00:06:17.890
<v Speaker 1>explanation that paints a more innocent </v>
<v Speaker 1>picture.</v>

102
00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:22.240
<v Speaker 1>You just might.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have the wrong idea.</v>

103
00:06:22.241 --> 00:06:23.920
<v Speaker 1>By the one or two things,</v>

104
00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:33.743
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cooper died only a few days after </v>

105
00:06:35.111 --> 00:06:37.360
<v Speaker 1>completing the final edit of eyes wide </v>
<v Speaker 1>shut.</v>

106
00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:38.643
<v Speaker 1>By that time in his career,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people had written and said a </v>

107
00:06:40.751 --> 00:06:43.420
<v Speaker 1>lot of things about his work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are still doing it.</v>

108
00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:46.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing it right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the viewer is who cooper cared about</v>

109
00:06:46.931 --> 00:06:47.764
<v Speaker 1>most and he or she stands were bill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hartford stands in between the artist's </v>

110
00:06:51.671 --> 00:06:52.660
<v Speaker 1>intention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>critics,</v>

111
00:06:52.661 --> 00:06:53.494
<v Speaker 1>interpretation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the actual experience of the movie </v>

112
00:06:55.901 --> 00:06:57.430
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eyes Wide Shut,</v>

113
00:06:57.431 --> 00:06:58.264
<v Speaker 1>I think is an ode to the experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the raw impression of seeing </v>

114
00:07:01.211 --> 00:07:02.044
<v Speaker 1>something marvelous Kubrick drags you </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the movie plants you edit center </v>

115
00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:08.500
<v Speaker 1>and challenges you to figure out what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>

116
00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:11.470
<v Speaker 1>He was a stylist,</v>
