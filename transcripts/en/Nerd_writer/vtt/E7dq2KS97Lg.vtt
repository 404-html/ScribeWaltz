1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.953
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's good to be back on schedule coffee </v>

2
00:00:03.301 --> 00:00:05.580
<v Speaker 1>on of Tuesday and Vlog 47.</v>

3
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:16.890
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

4
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.890
<v Speaker 1>so I'm tired of people trying to cash in</v>
<v Speaker 1>on my childhood hogs,</v>

5
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.380
<v Speaker 1>crazy bones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yoyos pokemon cards.</v>

6
00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:25.243
<v Speaker 1>The TV shows that B,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which just the commercials we sat </v>

7
00:00:27.151 --> 00:00:28.920
<v Speaker 1>through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the movies that changed our lives.</v>

8
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:29.963
<v Speaker 1>These things are strong into my heart </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a special tautness sensitive so </v>

9
00:00:33.751 --> 00:00:37.080
<v Speaker 1>that every cheap tug can make me feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like,</v>

10
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.273
<v Speaker 1>but not quite genuine emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you've seen the recently released </v>

11
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.040
<v Speaker 1>ad for Internet explorer called child of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nineties.</v>

12
00:00:44.041 --> 00:00:44.874
<v Speaker 1>I can't show it for copyright reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've put a link in the description </v>

13
00:00:47.011 --> 00:00:47.844
<v Speaker 1>if you want to watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Essentially the ad is a collection of </v>

14
00:00:49.171 --> 00:00:52.050
<v Speaker 1>those fads and items from the childhood </v>
<v Speaker 1>years of my generation,</v>

15
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.913
<v Speaker 1>nothing more certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know if you could do </v>

16
00:00:55.261 --> 00:00:58.470
<v Speaker 1>anything less.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a terrible ad that plays cheaply on</v>

17
00:00:58.471 --> 00:00:59.304
<v Speaker 1>a single emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not unlike those hard commercials for </v>

18
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.340
<v Speaker 1>Spca that show watery eye dogs to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>music of Sarah Mclaughlin.</v>

19
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.910
<v Speaker 1>Excuse me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the SPCA,</v>

20
00:01:12.911 --> 00:01:15.520
<v Speaker 1>commercial exploits are natural sympathy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and pity,</v>

21
00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:16.653
<v Speaker 1>poorly for a good cause.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Internet explorer add exploits our </v>

22
00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.570
<v Speaker 1>nostalgia for the loan cause of profit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

23
00:01:22.571 --> 00:01:23.404
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the exploitation of human emotion for </v>

24
00:01:24.461 --> 00:01:25.294
<v Speaker 1>profit is what makes the entire industry</v>
<v Speaker 1>of advertising despicable and </v>

25
00:01:28.181 --> 00:01:29.014
<v Speaker 1>reprehensible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as we are hardly any of us </v>

26
00:01:30.911 --> 00:01:31.744
<v Speaker 1>unconnected to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now we speak hypocritically when we </v>

27
00:01:34.301 --> 00:01:35.134
<v Speaker 1>vilify it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>though I've always contended citing my </v>

28
00:01:36.521 --> 00:01:39.640
<v Speaker 1>hypocritical vilification that it can </v>
<v Speaker 1>never be art with a capital,</v>

29
00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.420
<v Speaker 1>a advertising edits very best can be so </v>
<v Speaker 1>art full,</v>

30
00:01:43.421 --> 00:01:44.254
<v Speaker 1>so nuanced and spectacular that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes a hotbed of original creative </v>

31
00:01:48.101 --> 00:01:48.934
<v Speaker 1>ideas from which artists of every medium</v>
<v Speaker 1>can steal and use to their advantage at </v>

32
00:01:53.051 --> 00:01:55.900
<v Speaker 1>its worst.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Advertising Cherry picks easy sentiments</v>

33
00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:56.763
<v Speaker 1>and paying them over and over again </v>
<v Speaker 1>until we're all suffering from blunt </v>

34
00:02:00.371 --> 00:02:03.430
<v Speaker 1>force emotional trauma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd been watching ads for a long time.</v>

35
00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.353
<v Speaker 1>We know these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The difference and nothing makes this </v>

36
00:02:05.921 --> 00:02:08.890
<v Speaker 1>more clear than the child of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>nineties at is that now we.</v>

37
00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:14.070
<v Speaker 1>My generation is the target.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we're working in TV like I do.</v>

38
00:02:14.141 --> 00:02:16.510
<v Speaker 1>You hear that term tossed around a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The demo.</v>

39
00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.570
<v Speaker 1>How did we do in the demo?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are we performing well in the demo?</v>

40
00:02:19.571 --> 00:02:22.450
<v Speaker 1>The ratings weren't great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's okay because the demo was good.</v>

41
00:02:22.451 --> 00:02:23.284
<v Speaker 1>Demo is of course short for demographic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a particular section of the </v>

42
00:02:26.201 --> 00:02:28.990
<v Speaker 1>population,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when people say the demo,</v>

43
00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.270
<v Speaker 1>they're talking about a very specific </v>
<v Speaker 1>group.</v>

44
00:02:31.271 --> 00:02:34.890
<v Speaker 1>They're talking about people from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ages of 18 to 49.</v>

45
00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.650
<v Speaker 1>These are the golden geese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people to whom the gross majority of</v>

46
00:02:38.651 --> 00:02:41.250
<v Speaker 1>advertising and commercial entertainment</v>
<v Speaker 1>is ain't.</v>

47
00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.130
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

48
00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.993
<v Speaker 1>because we have the money with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>invention of people meters in the early </v>

49
00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:47.223
<v Speaker 1>eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Advertisers could see not only what </v>

50
00:02:48.641 --> 00:02:53.500
<v Speaker 1>people were watching but who was </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching what in the early 19 seventies,</v>

51
00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.270
<v Speaker 1>ABC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last place network,</v>

52
00:02:55.271 --> 00:03:00.271
<v Speaker 1>unable to pull in a wide swath and </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience sold what had which was younger</v>

53
00:03:00.311 --> 00:03:02.860
<v Speaker 1>viewers and the demo was born.</v>

54
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.890
<v Speaker 1>Total viewing numbers matter less than </v>
<v Speaker 1>performance in the demo.</v>

55
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:06.813
<v Speaker 1>A good example of this is the simpsons </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a show that routinely ranked </v>

56
00:03:09.041 --> 00:03:11.710
<v Speaker 1>somewhere in the sixties of the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>watched shows,</v>

57
00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:12.783
<v Speaker 1>but the average viewer of the simpsons </v>
<v Speaker 1>is 29 years old and that means that the </v>

58
00:03:17.561 --> 00:03:21.940
<v Speaker 1>simpsons can charge more per commercial </v>
<v Speaker 1>than many of the highest rank show.</v>

59
00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.790
<v Speaker 1>It's all predicated on the notion that </v>
<v Speaker 1>young people,</v>

60
00:03:24.791 --> 00:03:27.550
<v Speaker 1>young professionals like me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have disposable income,</v>

61
00:03:27.551 --> 00:03:30.100
<v Speaker 1>that we're more likely to spend than </v>
<v Speaker 1>older people.</v>

62
00:03:30.101 --> 00:03:30.934
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're more likely to find brands now </v>

63
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.550
<v Speaker 1>that will stick with for a lifetime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have the money.</v>

64
00:03:36.551 --> 00:03:39.760
<v Speaker 1>Advertisers want the money and TV shows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

65
00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:40.713
<v Speaker 1>the advertisers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are deeply ingrained </v>

66
00:03:43.091 --> 00:03:45.880
<v Speaker 1>relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 1>determining much of what you see and our</v>

67
00:03:45.881 --> 00:03:49.000
<v Speaker 1>soul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've passed into the black heart of the</v>

68
00:03:49.001 --> 00:03:52.210
<v Speaker 1>demo now and that means that everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>is up for grabs,</v>

69
00:03:52.211 --> 00:03:53.044
<v Speaker 1>including and especially our memory </v>
<v Speaker 1>knickknacks from the nineties when life </v>

70
00:03:56.141 --> 00:03:59.950
<v Speaker 1>wasn't so terribly depressed by the idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>of rent forever,</v>

71
00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:00.813
<v Speaker 1>when social media didn't exist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when life was homework and home cooked </v>

72
00:04:03.581 --> 00:04:05.140
<v Speaker 1>meals and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

73
00:04:05.141 --> 00:04:08.410
<v Speaker 1>when these things in their own time </v>
<v Speaker 1>giveaway to the new more complicated and</v>

74
00:04:08.411 --> 00:04:09.244
<v Speaker 1>meaningless things of the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will all be used and every sensitive </v>

75
00:04:13.391 --> 00:04:16.150
<v Speaker 1>heartstring will be pulled and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>generous rosie,</v>

76
00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:17.163
<v Speaker 1>Britta filter of memory will be </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploited so that the perfect time of </v>

77
00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:24.460
<v Speaker 1>then will unfold before our eyes in </v>
<v Speaker 1>glorious escape.</v>

78
00:04:24.461 --> 00:04:25.294
<v Speaker 1>And the only way back there is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>download the newest version of Internet </v>

79
00:04:29.381 --> 00:04:30.214
<v Speaker 1>explorer.</v>
