1
00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:04.583
<v Speaker 1>Probably no surprise that Donald Trump </v>
<v Speaker 1>has been the subject of over 2100 CNN </v>

2
00:00:09.121 --> 00:00:13.080
<v Speaker 1>reports since he announced his candidacy</v>
<v Speaker 1>for president on June 16th.</v>

3
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:14.363
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe 10,</v>

4
00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:15.303
<v Speaker 1>2100 is a little bit surprising,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the basic calculus is something I </v>

5
00:00:18.181 --> 00:00:22.350
<v Speaker 1>think everyone cynically understands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump gets ratings.</v>

6
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:23.453
<v Speaker 1>The news carries a little less obvious </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that trump's high poll numbers are </v>

7
00:00:28.021 --> 00:00:31.500
<v Speaker 1>actually a result of his outside </v>
<v Speaker 1>coverage in the media.</v>

8
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:32.603
<v Speaker 1>Political science professor John Sides </v>
<v Speaker 1>has produced a number of handicrafts </v>

9
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.383
<v Speaker 1>that show the correlation between </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump's share of coverage versus his </v>

10
00:00:39.571 --> 00:00:42.300
<v Speaker 1>poll numbers and it's pretty conclusive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's more,</v>

11
00:00:42.301 --> 00:00:45.270
<v Speaker 1>if you graph all the job candidates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>polling numbers,</v>

12
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.070
<v Speaker 1>verse their share of coverage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get a correlation of point nine six,</v>

13
00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.740
<v Speaker 1>close to a straight line as I've ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>seen.</v>

14
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.850
<v Speaker 1>Of course you could say causation moves </v>
<v Speaker 1>the other way here.</v>

15
00:00:56.851 --> 00:01:00.510
<v Speaker 1>That whole numbers drive coverage and in</v>
<v Speaker 1>some way they do.</v>

16
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:01.733
<v Speaker 1>Only news coverage usually comes first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People hear a lot about a candidate </v>

17
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:09.750
<v Speaker 1>research that can they identify in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same way that you do when you hear a pop</v>

18
00:01:09.751 --> 00:01:12.270
<v Speaker 1>song on the radio over and over and over</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

19
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.680
<v Speaker 1>and that exposure ultimately means </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're more likely to give that name to</v>

20
00:01:19.681 --> 00:01:20.514
<v Speaker 1>pollsters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The news then reports more on the top </v>

21
00:01:23.311 --> 00:01:25.380
<v Speaker 1>candidates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means even more coverage,</v>

22
00:01:25.381 --> 00:01:26.214
<v Speaker 1>which means even higher polling and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes a cycle that perpetuates itself </v>

23
00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.100
<v Speaker 1>until the top dog makes a mistake.</v>

24
00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.270
<v Speaker 2>It's three agencies of government when I</v>
<v Speaker 2>get there that are gone,</v>

25
00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.100
<v Speaker 2>commerce education and the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

26
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.140
<v Speaker 2>what's the third one there?</v>

27
00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.210
<v Speaker 1>Or a new fresh face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>steal some attention away.</v>

28
00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.420
<v Speaker 1>Women all over this country heard very </v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly what Mr Trump said.</v>

29
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.870
<v Speaker 1>The problem is that trump's mistakes are</v>
<v Speaker 1>often so inflammatory,</v>

30
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.300
<v Speaker 1>newsmaking that they worked to his </v>
<v Speaker 1>advantage,</v>

31
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.760
<v Speaker 1>and new fresh faces are the ones that </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump attacks the hardest,</v>

32
00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.020
<v Speaker 1>listened to her for more than five </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes straight.</v>

33
00:02:00.021 --> 00:02:02.210
<v Speaker 1>You get a headache.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty 100 news stories later.</v>

34
00:02:02.211 --> 00:02:05.570
<v Speaker 1>And here we are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know why the news works like this.</v>

35
00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.230
<v Speaker 1>Less ratings mean less ad revenue means </v>
<v Speaker 1>less.</v>

36
00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.890
<v Speaker 1>Profit means lower stock prices means </v>
<v Speaker 1>fewer investors,</v>

37
00:02:12.891 --> 00:02:17.150
<v Speaker 1>means layoffs in America who indeed in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the global economy,</v>

38
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.360
<v Speaker 1>everything always has to grow the news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially Cable News,</v>

39
00:02:22.461 --> 00:02:25.970
<v Speaker 1>has a vague interest in keeping its </v>
<v Speaker 1>dependence on capitalists.</v>

40
00:02:25.971 --> 00:02:26.804
<v Speaker 1>Incentives under wraps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though everyone knows that ratings </v>

41
00:02:29.711 --> 00:02:30.544
<v Speaker 1>to a large part determined the news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>news organizations have to tout their </v>

42
00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.450
<v Speaker 1>journalistic integrity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if it's only a formality and this.</v>

43
00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:39.283
<v Speaker 1>This might just be the gift that Donald </v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump is giving to all of us more than </v>

44
00:02:44.191 --> 00:02:45.024
<v Speaker 1>anything I can remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The trump phenomenon strips away the </v>

45
00:02:47.731 --> 00:02:52.080
<v Speaker 1>false righteousness of the news media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When trump does something outrageous,</v>

46
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.110
<v Speaker 1>CNN doesn't cover it by choice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because they are forced to do so,</v>

47
00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:58.373
<v Speaker 1>the trump phenomenon strips away the </v>
<v Speaker 1>false righteousness of politicians to </v>

48
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.310
<v Speaker 1>trump has cooperated political language </v>
<v Speaker 1>and employed it to such a ridiculous and</v>

49
00:03:06.311 --> 00:03:10.510
<v Speaker 1>shameless degree that it's emptiness is </v>
<v Speaker 1>laid totally bare,</v>

50
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:11.583
<v Speaker 1>and lastly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump strips away the false </v>

51
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.170
<v Speaker 1>righteousness of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the American public.</v>

52
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.590
<v Speaker 1>The second gop debate was the highest </v>
<v Speaker 1>rated program in the history of CNN.</v>

53
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.970
<v Speaker 1>CNN is forced to cover trump because we </v>
<v Speaker 1>forced them.</v>

54
00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.993
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When we put on something with Jeb Bush </v>

55
00:03:30.681 --> 00:03:34.010
<v Speaker 3>talking about the economy or Scott </v>
<v Speaker 3>Walker talking about labor unions,</v>

56
00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:35.360
<v Speaker 3>why doesn't anybody watched that?</v>

57
00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.660
<v Speaker 1>It's in our nature to gravitate toward </v>
<v Speaker 1>confirmation bias and sensationalism.</v>

58
00:03:40.661 --> 00:03:45.010
<v Speaker 1>It takes a force of will to consume </v>
<v Speaker 1>media that may be bored,</v>

59
00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.040
<v Speaker 1>but crucial for making intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 1>political choices,</v>

60
00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.520
<v Speaker 1>and in large part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a mental muscle that most of us,</v>

61
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.840
<v Speaker 1>myself often included,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to exercise.</v>

62
00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:55.713
<v Speaker 1>Donald trump exists at the nexus of all </v>
<v Speaker 1>these things and his invocation of all </v>

63
00:04:00.191 --> 00:04:01.024
<v Speaker 1>three is I think an important lesson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The news media politicians and the </v>

64
00:04:05.441 --> 00:04:10.441
<v Speaker 1>general public are all responsible for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the existence of Donald Trump and no one</v>

65
00:04:11.321 --> 00:04:14.560
<v Speaker 1>of these things is going to change </v>
<v Speaker 1>drastically overnight,</v>

66
00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:16.023
<v Speaker 1>but if all of them move just a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit in the right direction toward </v>

67
00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:21.820
<v Speaker 1>integrity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>honesty,</v>

68
00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.380
<v Speaker 1>and engagement respectively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the difference could be substantial.</v>

69
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.873
<v Speaker 1>We know that the news media is biased </v>
<v Speaker 1>and politicians talk bullshit and the </v>

70
00:04:31.721 --> 00:04:35.800
<v Speaker 1>news and the politicians know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know it still.</v>

71
00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.660
<v Speaker 1>They go through the formalities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is exactly formalities like this that</v>

72
00:04:40.661 --> 00:04:43.780
<v Speaker 1>can keep the system alive longer than it</v>
<v Speaker 1>needs to be.</v>

73
00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:45.543
<v Speaker 1>So maybe we need someone like Donald </v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump to pull down that last layer of </v>

74
00:04:53.141 --> 00:04:55.330
<v Speaker 1>credibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How are you going to create jobs in this</v>

75
00:04:55.331 --> 00:04:58.270
<v Speaker 1>country?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to do it.</v>

76
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:02.820
<v Speaker 4>Hey everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thanks for watching.</v>

77
00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:08.030
<v Speaker 4>We heard about $950 on the patron,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is $50 away from the big goal of a</v>

78
00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.290
<v Speaker 4>thousand dollars that starts to make </v>
<v Speaker 4>this financially feasible for me.</v>

79
00:05:13.291 --> 00:05:16.380
<v Speaker 4>So if you like the nerd writer have you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's something you don't think you're</v>

80
00:05:16.381 --> 00:05:18.000
<v Speaker 4>seeing somewhere else on youtube or the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Internet.</v>

81
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:19.043
<v Speaker 4>Pledge a little bit money for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>project and we can do a lot of more </v>

82
00:05:21.931 --> 00:05:24.180
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no more stickers or mugs left,</v>

83
00:05:24.181 --> 00:05:26.880
<v Speaker 4>but I want to order some more swag,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe some more mugs,</v>

84
00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:31.350
<v Speaker 4>but I'd like to hear what you would like</v>
<v Speaker 4>of nerd writer swag and that universal.</v>

85
00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:34.560
<v Speaker 4>Let me know in the comments and we'll </v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll get some and put them up.</v>

86
00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:38.550
<v Speaker 4>Thank you so much for watching and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>will see you guys next Wednesday.</v>
