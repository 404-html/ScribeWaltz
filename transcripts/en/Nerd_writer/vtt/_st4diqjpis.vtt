1
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.990
<v Speaker 1>I've never been much of a fan of music </v>
<v Speaker 1>videos and I think that's because I sort</v>

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.833
<v Speaker 1>of just like my music as music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to close my eyes and focus on </v>

3
00:00:12.811 --> 00:00:16.140
<v Speaker 1>what's happening sonically because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what music is.</v>

4
00:00:16.141 --> 00:00:20.280
<v Speaker 1>It's something that you hear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that means I can be totally engrossed</v>

5
00:00:20.281 --> 00:00:22.740
<v Speaker 1>and in love with beyonce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his latest album,</v>

6
00:00:22.741 --> 00:00:26.880
<v Speaker 1>and not care at all about the dozen </v>
<v Speaker 1>videos that came out with it,</v>

7
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:27.923
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'm in the minority here and the </v>

8
00:00:29.761 --> 00:00:33.540
<v Speaker 1>truth is that despite music being an </v>
<v Speaker 1>oral medium,</v>

9
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.590
<v Speaker 1>it's long had an intimate relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the visual,</v>

10
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.873
<v Speaker 1>so I want to talk about perhaps the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>iconic visual supplement in the history </v>

11
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.280
<v Speaker 1>of music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but before we talk about that,</v>

12
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:47.143
<v Speaker 1>what about album covers in general these</v>
<v Speaker 1>days we perceive them as a kind of </v>

13
00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:52.123
<v Speaker 1>visual statement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the album title or the song names </v>

14
00:00:54.771 --> 00:00:59.420
<v Speaker 1>that help us situate the tone or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling of what we're going to hear.</v>

15
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.630
<v Speaker 1>It granted that it stays within the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dimension of a square.</v>

16
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.750
<v Speaker 1>The options and styles are basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>limitless,</v>

17
00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.883
<v Speaker 1>but in the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>records packaging was surely </v>

18
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.870
<v Speaker 1>utilitarian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The early 78 RPM gramophone records were</v>

19
00:01:12.871 --> 00:01:13.704
<v Speaker 1>mostly outfitted with Brown paper or </v>
<v Speaker 1>cardboard sleeves to protect the </v>

20
00:01:17.641 --> 00:01:18.474
<v Speaker 1>recording.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't until 1938 when Columbia </v>

21
00:01:20.791 --> 00:01:21.624
<v Speaker 1>records hired Alex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>stine Weiss as its very first art </v>

22
00:01:24.601 --> 00:01:25.434
<v Speaker 1>director that the idea of cover art came</v>
<v Speaker 1>into existence against the plane or </v>

23
00:01:29.701 --> 00:01:30.534
<v Speaker 1>traditional design of early covers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stein Weiss's original eyecatching art </v>

24
00:01:34.201 --> 00:01:35.034
<v Speaker 1>initiated just a huge boom in sales and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the market followed as it always does </v>

25
00:01:39.691 --> 00:01:40.524
<v Speaker 1>when something works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Record stores were refigured so that </v>

26
00:01:43.681 --> 00:01:46.350
<v Speaker 1>instead of just seeing the bindings like</v>
<v Speaker 1>books on a shelf,</v>

27
00:01:46.351 --> 00:01:49.350
<v Speaker 1>consumers were encouraged to flip </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the covers.</v>

28
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:50.483
<v Speaker 1>This all points to just how important </v>
<v Speaker 1>the cover art was to the marketing of </v>

29
00:01:54.421 --> 00:01:57.720
<v Speaker 1>the product.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And music is a product.</v>

30
00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.820
<v Speaker 1>It's a commodity that people consume and</v>
<v Speaker 1>since you can't buy the band itself,</v>

31
00:02:02.821 --> 00:02:06.000
<v Speaker 1>and since the music has no spacial </v>
<v Speaker 1>dimension,</v>

32
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.330
<v Speaker 1>the album cover emerged as the standard </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the commodity to be purchased.</v>

33
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.133
<v Speaker 1>This explains the rise of photography on</v>
<v Speaker 1>album covers and what's called the </v>

34
00:02:16.591 --> 00:02:17.990
<v Speaker 1>personality cover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

35
00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.630
<v Speaker 1>one of those covers where it's just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>photograph of the band or musician,</v>

36
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:22.553
<v Speaker 1>still pretty popular today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A perfect example of this personality </v>

37
00:02:25.321 --> 00:02:27.870
<v Speaker 1>cover can be seen on the Beatles first </v>
<v Speaker 1>album.</v>

38
00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.853
<v Speaker 1>Please,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please meet.</v>

39
00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.360
<v Speaker 1>Look at those bright smiling faces </v>
<v Speaker 1>staring warmly into the camera lens.</v>

40
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.570
<v Speaker 1>As Susan Sontag once brilliantly said in</v>
<v Speaker 1>its simplest form,</v>

41
00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:38.613
<v Speaker 1>we have in a photograph surrogate </v>
<v Speaker 1>possession of a cherished person or </v>

42
00:02:43.361 --> 00:02:45.040
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As their career advanced,</v>

43
00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:50.070
<v Speaker 1>the Beatles seemed to become darkly </v>
<v Speaker 1>aware of their status as commodities,</v>

44
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:51.793
<v Speaker 1>perhaps nowhere more plainly </v>
<v Speaker 1>acknowledged that on the cover of their </v>

45
00:02:54.411 --> 00:02:58.040
<v Speaker 1>fourth album,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aptly titled Beatles for sale,</v>

46
00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.903
<v Speaker 1>featuring another of the personality </v>
<v Speaker 1>cover this time without the warmth and </v>

47
00:03:03.011 --> 00:03:03.670
<v Speaker 1>the smiles.</v>

48
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:04.503
<v Speaker 1>By the time sergeant pepper's emerge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Beatles had already begun </v>

49
00:03:07.181 --> 00:03:11.590
<v Speaker 1>challenging the conventions with popular</v>
<v Speaker 1>music and its role in culture,</v>

50
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.350
<v Speaker 1>and this extended to the album covers </v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

51
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.060
<v Speaker 1>First in rubber soul with it's distorted</v>
<v Speaker 1>image and funky tight face.</v>

52
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.870
<v Speaker 1>Then with revolver for which they </v>
<v Speaker 1>employed their friend and artists,</v>

53
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:23.733
<v Speaker 1>Klaus Vorman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we did a kind of 19 sixties update of </v>

54
00:03:26.591 --> 00:03:31.040
<v Speaker 1>Victorian illustrator Aubrey beardsley </v>
<v Speaker 1>famous black ink drawings.</v>

55
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.923
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Beatles were leaders in expanding </v>

56
00:03:34.271 --> 00:03:35.104
<v Speaker 1>and album covers function from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>marketing tool to a work of art in its </v>

57
00:03:39.371 --> 00:03:40.204
<v Speaker 1>own right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that brings us back to what is </v>

58
00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:43.203
<v Speaker 1>really the holy grail of album covers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Beatles' sergeant pepper's lonely </v>

59
00:03:47.891 --> 00:03:48.724
<v Speaker 1>hearts club band,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cover that explicitly engages the </v>

60
00:03:51.791 --> 00:03:52.624
<v Speaker 1>audience in so many ways and critiques </v>
<v Speaker 1>and interpretations and comparisons and </v>

61
00:03:56.681 --> 00:03:57.514
<v Speaker 1>contrasts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a cover that invites you in and a </v>

62
00:04:00.491 --> 00:04:01.324
<v Speaker 1>perfect example of this is the immediate</v>
<v Speaker 1>challenge to just identify who all of </v>

63
00:04:05.471 --> 00:04:06.400
<v Speaker 1>these people are.</v>

64
00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:07.413
<v Speaker 1>What do Indian Gurus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Karl Marx and Bob Dylan all have in </v>

65
00:04:11.351 --> 00:04:12.184
<v Speaker 1>common?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The sergeant pepper's cover once you to </v>

66
00:04:13.901 --> 00:04:16.240
<v Speaker 1>ask questions like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

67
00:04:16.241 --> 00:04:17.230
<v Speaker 1>in one sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

68
00:04:17.231 --> 00:04:20.890
<v Speaker 1>these people just represent the Beatles </v>
<v Speaker 1>interests and influences,</v>

69
00:04:20.891 --> 00:04:25.891
<v Speaker 1>many of whom didn't make the final cut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet by juxtaposing high brow artists</v>

70
00:04:26.351 --> 00:04:27.184
<v Speaker 1>and thinkers like marks or Aubrey </v>
<v Speaker 1>Beardsley or George Bernard Shaw or </v>

71
00:04:31.031 --> 00:04:34.420
<v Speaker 1>Dylan Thomas with pop icons like Bob </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dylan,</v>

72
00:04:34.421 --> 00:04:36.580
<v Speaker 1>Marilyn Monro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marlin Brando,</v>

73
00:04:36.581 --> 00:04:37.414
<v Speaker 1>and Shirley temple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Beatles signaled the breakdown and </v>

74
00:04:40.571 --> 00:04:41.404
<v Speaker 1>mixing of high and low culture that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves exemplified more than any </v>

75
00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:47.793
<v Speaker 1>other artist with sergeant pepper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Beatles were in a posture of </v>

76
00:04:51.191 --> 00:04:53.710
<v Speaker 1>challenge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>challenging everything they'd been up to</v>

77
00:04:53.711 --> 00:04:54.544
<v Speaker 1>that point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>challenging the highbrow art critics to </v>

78
00:04:56.411 --> 00:04:58.870
<v Speaker 1>abandon their exclusion of popular </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>

79
00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.853
<v Speaker 1>challenging the listening public to </v>
<v Speaker 1>engage with something other than love </v>

80
00:05:03.191 --> 00:05:04.024
<v Speaker 1>songs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the same for courts there were even </v>

81
00:05:05.621 --> 00:05:10.621
<v Speaker 1>challenging the feelings of unity that </v>
<v Speaker 1>defined the summer of love in 1967,</v>

82
00:05:11.021 --> 00:05:11.854
<v Speaker 1>delivering a suite of songs that </v>
<v Speaker 1>featured alienation and loss as much as </v>

83
00:05:15.941 --> 00:05:16.774
<v Speaker 1>it did love and togetherness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The album cover echoes these challenges </v>

84
00:05:20.741 --> 00:05:24.910
<v Speaker 1>and adds some of its own by using the </v>
<v Speaker 1>technique of photo montage,</v>

85
00:05:24.911 --> 00:05:29.260
<v Speaker 1>which manipulates photography's unique </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to depict reality.</v>

86
00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:30.303
<v Speaker 1>The Beatles blend and collapsed the </v>
<v Speaker 1>values of a number of different times </v>

87
00:05:33.791 --> 00:05:38.410
<v Speaker 1>and places by staging the scene as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>performance and an audience.</v>

88
00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:39.880
<v Speaker 1>The band challenges us to do,</v>

89
00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:40.733
<v Speaker 2>dwell on the function both indeed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These considerations were at the front </v>

90
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.113
<v Speaker 2>of their minds as the Beatles had only </v>
<v Speaker 2>recently elected to stop performing </v>

91
00:05:48.271 --> 00:05:49.530
<v Speaker 2>live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>After the mayhem,</v>

92
00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:54.030
<v Speaker 2>a beatle mania began to diminish the </v>
<v Speaker 2>quality of music while some accused them</v>

93
00:05:54.031 --> 00:05:55.200
<v Speaker 2>of leaving their fans.</v>

94
00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.770
<v Speaker 1>Hi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The sergeant pepper's cover suggests the</v>

95
00:05:57.771 --> 00:05:58.604
<v Speaker 1>opposite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the decision to stop touring was </v>

96
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.520
<v Speaker 1>out of respect for their fans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not out of fear or contempt.</v>

97
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.130
<v Speaker 1>We should also note that the designer of</v>
<v Speaker 1>discover,</v>

98
00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:07.993
<v Speaker 1>Peter Blake was a noted pop artists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a style that used aspects of mass </v>

99
00:06:12.351 --> 00:06:16.040
<v Speaker 1>culture to bring attention to the fuzzy </v>
<v Speaker 1>lines between art,</v>

100
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:17.840
<v Speaker 1>advertising,</v>
<v Speaker 1>news,</v>

101
00:06:17.841 --> 00:06:18.674
<v Speaker 1>and all other forms of media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The pop artists wanted to get people to </v>

102
00:06:21.711 --> 00:06:22.544
<v Speaker 1>think about the process and </v>
<v Speaker 1>manufacturing of ar and how it's </v>

103
00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:29.510
<v Speaker 1>categorizations and hierarchies are </v>
<v Speaker 1>largely arbitrary.</v>

104
00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:33.560
<v Speaker 1>Blake and the Beatles design the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sergeant pepper cover as both a piece of</v>

105
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:37.100
<v Speaker 1>art and a product inside it's gatefold </v>
<v Speaker 1>sleeve.</v>

106
00:06:37.101 --> 00:06:37.934
<v Speaker 1>The record had paper cutouts of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pepper bans regalia adding to its </v>

107
00:06:41.361 --> 00:06:42.194
<v Speaker 1>consumer kitsch value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet it was also the first album to </v>

108
00:06:45.261 --> 00:06:49.850
<v Speaker 1>display the lyrics on the packaging,</v>
<v Speaker 1>encouraging listeners to interrogate the</v>

109
00:06:49.851 --> 00:06:52.700
<v Speaker 1>records,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual content as well.</v>

110
00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:53.913
<v Speaker 1>The truth is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course that music perhaps more </v>

111
00:06:55.461 --> 00:06:56.294
<v Speaker 1>prominently than any other art form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plays both parts as a commodity and an </v>

112
00:07:01.581 --> 00:07:02.414
<v Speaker 1>aesthetic object,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in many ways the two functions are </v>

113
00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:05.923
<v Speaker 1>inseparable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Beatles knew this and maybe they </v>

114
00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:09.344
<v Speaker 1>regretted it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they were self aware enough to see </v>

115
00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:12.313
<v Speaker 1>that it was inescapable and if music had</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be marketed and if the visual was </v>

116
00:07:15.801 --> 00:07:18.050
<v Speaker 1>going to be the vehicle of that John,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paul,</v>

117
00:07:18.051 --> 00:07:18.884
<v Speaker 1>George,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Ringo were going to be as playful </v>

118
00:07:20.751 --> 00:07:24.180
<v Speaker 1>here they were with everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the end,</v>

119
00:07:24.181 --> 00:07:25.014
<v Speaker 1>this photograph of photographs levels a </v>
<v Speaker 1>critique on representation itself to </v>

120
00:07:30.571 --> 00:07:33.540
<v Speaker 1>show how music is mediated by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>visual.</v>

121
00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:34.523
<v Speaker 1>The Beatles put themselves on this cover</v>
<v Speaker 1>three times once as the wax figures of </v>

122
00:07:39.271 --> 00:07:40.104
<v Speaker 1>the mop top beetles that they were once </v>
<v Speaker 1>as the fake pepper band and it's bright </v>

123
00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:44.783
<v Speaker 1>and eye catching glory and finally as </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves pictured not on the cover of </v>

124
00:07:49.681 --> 00:07:50.514
<v Speaker 1>their album,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but by the effects of that cover in the </v>

125
00:07:52.501 --> 00:07:57.501
<v Speaker 1>minds of everyone who looked at the real</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beatles can't be represented this way.</v>

126
00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:02.010
<v Speaker 1>Not really not like this or like this or</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this.</v>

127
00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:07.460
<v Speaker 1>The cover of sergeant pepper's lonely </v>
<v Speaker 1>hearts club band points to the truth.</v>

128
00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:08.873
<v Speaker 1>What the Beatles themselves knew that </v>
<v Speaker 1>all music is invisible then in the news </v>

129
00:08:18.091 --> 00:08:20.840
