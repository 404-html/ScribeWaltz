1
00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.700
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever bought something nice for </v>
<v Speaker 1>your apartment or your room,</v>

2
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.830
<v Speaker 1>brought it home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put it in place,</v>

3
00:00:07.831 --> 00:00:10.200
<v Speaker 1>and had the thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>

4
00:00:10.201 --> 00:00:11.034
<v Speaker 1>my apartment is a piece of shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe you bought a new shirt and </v>

5
00:00:14.551 --> 00:00:16.560
<v Speaker 1>suddenly you're grabbing for it all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

6
00:00:16.561 --> 00:00:19.890
<v Speaker 1>waiting for that day in the rotation </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you can wear it again,</v>

7
00:00:19.891 --> 00:00:20.724
<v Speaker 1>tired of everything you already own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The name for this social consumer's </v>

8
00:00:24.241 --> 00:00:26.820
<v Speaker 1>phenomenon is called the [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 1>effect,</v>

9
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.190
<v Speaker 1>and it works on two principles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First step,</v>

10
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.053
<v Speaker 1>all the products purchased by a consumer</v>
<v Speaker 1>aim to be cohesive with that consumer's </v>

11
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.470
<v Speaker 1>identity with all the products that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>already owned.</v>

12
00:00:37.471 --> 00:00:39.630
<v Speaker 1>Second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the introduction of a new product,</v>

13
00:00:39.631 --> 00:00:44.040
<v Speaker 1>which is desirable button anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deviant from the existing cohesion,</v>

14
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.790
<v Speaker 1>can trigger a process of spiraling </v>
<v Speaker 1>consumption.</v>

15
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:48.653
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as much as we decry the dangers of a </v>

16
00:00:50.791 --> 00:00:55.050
<v Speaker 1>materialist society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the things we own comprise a significant</v>

17
00:00:55.051 --> 00:00:56.340
<v Speaker 1>part of who we are.</v>

18
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.233
<v Speaker 1>Our identities are tied up in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>clothes and our gadgets and the way of </v>

19
00:01:01.861 --> 00:01:02.694
<v Speaker 1>our furniture more than anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We try to find a unity in our </v>

20
00:01:06.091 --> 00:01:06.924
<v Speaker 1>possessions and by extension,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to convince ourselves that our </v>

21
00:01:09.361 --> 00:01:10.194
<v Speaker 1>identity itself is uniform.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The effect was first identified by its </v>

22
00:01:13.441 --> 00:01:14.274
<v Speaker 1>namesake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>French philosopher Denny Dita wrote in </v>

23
00:01:16.471 --> 00:01:20.610
<v Speaker 1>an essay called regrets on potting with </v>
<v Speaker 1>my own dressing gown.</v>

24
00:01:20.611 --> 00:01:22.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why I did an English accent</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

25
00:01:22.291 --> 00:01:23.124
<v Speaker 1>He's French in the sad truth is given a </v>
<v Speaker 1>brand new scarlet dressing gown to </v>

26
00:01:26.821 --> 00:01:27.654
<v Speaker 1>replace his worn out one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but soon laments that the luxury of his </v>

27
00:01:31.051 --> 00:01:33.750
<v Speaker 1>new item shames all his other </v>
<v Speaker 1>possessions,</v>

28
00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:34.763
<v Speaker 1>so he goes on a rampage and replaces </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything he owns with beautiful new </v>

29
00:01:38.191 --> 00:01:39.024
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eventually putting himself in serious </v>

30
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.473
<v Speaker 1>debt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was the absolute master of my old </v>

31
00:01:44.641 --> 00:01:45.510
<v Speaker 1>robe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

32
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.450
<v Speaker 1>I have become the slave of my new one.</v>

33
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.320
<v Speaker 1>The effect is at the core of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>materialist ethos,</v>

34
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.000
<v Speaker 1>prodded by that familiar yearning of </v>
<v Speaker 1>keeping up with the Joneses to fit in or</v>

35
00:01:57.001 --> 00:01:59.460
<v Speaker 1>even outclass those around us and in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>media.</v>

36
00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.810
<v Speaker 1>We are not capable of stopping at simply</v>
<v Speaker 1>upgrading or updating one corner of what</v>

37
00:02:05.671 --> 00:02:06.504
<v Speaker 1>we own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We grabbed fee virtually at a better </v>

38
00:02:08.581 --> 00:02:13.080
<v Speaker 1>kind of unity even at the expense of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>financial wellbeing.</v>

39
00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.720
<v Speaker 1>This poses a problem for companies that </v>
<v Speaker 1>produce goods.</v>

40
00:02:15.721 --> 00:02:20.721
<v Speaker 1>It's why stuff usually comes in sets and</v>
<v Speaker 1>those sets usually at a discount.</v>

41
00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.470
<v Speaker 1>It's why Ikea showcases full rooms in </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

42
00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.710
<v Speaker 1>Disney Disneyland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like tour of the kinds of people you can</v>

43
00:02:28.711 --> 00:02:29.544
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can we be blamed for this materialist </v>

44
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.660
<v Speaker 1>craving in us?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

45
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.750
<v Speaker 1>the answer is definitely yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a soft yes,</v>

46
00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.550
<v Speaker 1>a soft yes for we who are pampered rats </v>
<v Speaker 1>within the capitalist construct,</v>

47
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.400
<v Speaker 1>modern men and women laboring as rust.</v>

48
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.400
<v Speaker 1>Cole says an illusion of having a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cohesive uniform identity.</v>

49
00:02:49.591 --> 00:02:53.580
<v Speaker 1>It seems to us might be some solve </v>
<v Speaker 1>against the chaotic truth.</v>

50
00:02:53.581 --> 00:02:58.581
<v Speaker 1>That reality is as fractious and self </v>
<v Speaker 1>constructed as we are one day we'll have</v>

51
00:02:59.471 --> 00:03:03.010
<v Speaker 1>to strike out against this insane </v>
<v Speaker 1>consumerism.</v>

52
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:04.443
<v Speaker 1>Until then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Ikea spring living room set is as </v>

53
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.720
<v Speaker 1>good as crack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey everybody.</v>

54
00:03:10.721 --> 00:03:11.554
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for watching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The [inaudible] effect is a really </v>

55
00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:16.330
<v Speaker 1>interesting social phenomenon tied in </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a lot of other things.</v>

56
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.810
<v Speaker 1>You can read more about it in the links </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I'll put in the description below.</v>

57
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.540
<v Speaker 1>All companies that make goods and </v>
<v Speaker 1>services deal with this problem.</v>

58
00:03:22.541 --> 00:03:24.490
<v Speaker 1>The environmentalist movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

59
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:25.750
<v Speaker 1>is no exception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Green,</v>

60
00:03:25.751 --> 00:03:28.660
<v Speaker 1>good producers and cis not on buying </v>
<v Speaker 1>their stuff,</v>

61
00:03:28.661 --> 00:03:33.490
<v Speaker 1>but on replacing the harmful things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you already follow me on twitter.</v>

62
00:03:33.491 --> 00:03:37.810
<v Speaker 1>I love to tweet and try to make people </v>
<v Speaker 1>think or laugh or smile or whatever.</v>

63
00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:39.420
<v Speaker 1>I just think it's an awesome platform.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

64
00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:40.443
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to put this video on reddit </v>

65
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:42.663
<v Speaker 1>and hopefully it gets some traction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll put the link there when I do an </v>

66
00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.530
<v Speaker 1>upload it.</v>

67
00:03:46.531 --> 00:03:51.531
<v Speaker 1>it's been awesome in spreading the stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I make and I'll see you next week.</v>
