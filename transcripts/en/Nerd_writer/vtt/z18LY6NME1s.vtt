1
00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:06.130
<v Speaker 1>It was Stephen Fry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

2
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:11.020
<v Speaker 1>who said a truth thing poorly expressed </v>
<v Speaker 1>is alive.</v>

3
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.133
<v Speaker 1>It's the theory that the language you </v>
<v Speaker 1>speak determines how you think it </v>

4
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.060
<v Speaker 1>affects how you see everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The point being that there is no thought</v>

5
00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.480
<v Speaker 1>without expression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no content without form,</v>

6
00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.620
<v Speaker 1>that an idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>however profound it feels to you,</v>

7
00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.050
<v Speaker 1>does not really exist until you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>write it down or in some cases put it on</v>

8
00:00:36.371 --> 00:00:37.204
<v Speaker 1>film to watch Disney Villeneuve's </v>
<v Speaker 1>arrival is to watch a film maker in </v>

9
00:00:40.751 --> 00:00:44.440
<v Speaker 1>command of the language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His ideas presuppose,</v>

10
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.370
<v Speaker 1>which is to say that he has a firm grasp</v>
<v Speaker 1>on craft.</v>

11
00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:49.293
<v Speaker 1>I can't really tell you how soothing </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is for me as a film goer to feel </v>

12
00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:53.223
<v Speaker 1>that I'm in the hands of someone who </v>
<v Speaker 1>knows why the film is constructed the </v>

13
00:00:56.261 --> 00:00:57.094
<v Speaker 1>way it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So much of today's filmmaking is all </v>

14
00:00:59.141 --> 00:00:59.974
<v Speaker 1>over the place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the point where the viewer has to </v>

15
00:01:01.571 --> 00:01:06.190
<v Speaker 1>exert themselves more to compensate for </v>
<v Speaker 1>a lack of focus in this way.</v>

16
00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.670
<v Speaker 1>I think arrival is the perfect response </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the bad movies.</v>

17
00:01:09.671 --> 00:01:12.640
<v Speaker 1>We see so much of pretty much everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do,</v>

18
00:01:12.641 --> 00:01:14.710
<v Speaker 1>wrong arrival dose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

19
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:15.633
<v Speaker 1>It is effective and impactful and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>does this by focusing on the very thing </v>

20
00:01:19.211 --> 00:01:24.211
<v Speaker 1>that affects and impacts us language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think arrival is just as concerned</v>

21
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
<v Speaker 1>with the language of film as it is with </v>
<v Speaker 1>written or spoken or alien language.</v>

22
00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:31.143
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first couple of scenes are kind of </v>

23
00:01:32.561 --> 00:01:35.890
<v Speaker 1>like an enlarged experiment in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>coolest shop effect,</v>

24
00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:36.813
<v Speaker 1>the phenomenon in which a viewer derives</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning from two sequential shots that </v>

25
00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:41.583
<v Speaker 1>hitchcock famously illustrated by </v>
<v Speaker 1>turning a kindly gentleman into a </v>

26
00:01:45.131 --> 00:01:47.860
<v Speaker 1>pervert by replacing a single reverse </v>
<v Speaker 1>shot.</v>

27
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.840
<v Speaker 1>They'll move,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does the same thing in a rival,</v>

28
00:01:49.841 --> 00:01:50.674
<v Speaker 1>but on the scene level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first scene is a montage of the </v>

29
00:01:53.471 --> 00:01:56.620
<v Speaker 1>birth and young death of Amy Adams </v>
<v Speaker 1>starter.</v>

30
00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:57.603
<v Speaker 1>The second scene is Adam's coming to </v>
<v Speaker 1>teach at her school on the day of the </v>

31
00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:01.533
<v Speaker 1>aliens arrival and because of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tragedy we witness in the first scene </v>

32
00:02:04.631 --> 00:02:07.000
<v Speaker 1>and our assumption that the film's </v>
<v Speaker 1>timeline is linear.</v>

33
00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:08.043
<v Speaker 1>We read Adam's disinterest here as </v>
<v Speaker 1>despondency and her general demeanor as </v>

34
00:02:13.031 --> 00:02:13.864
<v Speaker 1>one of deep sadness and heartache.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not until we finished the film and </v>

35
00:02:17.471 --> 00:02:18.304
<v Speaker 1>learn that the opening montage happens </v>
<v Speaker 1>after the events of the movie that we </v>

36
00:02:21.731 --> 00:02:26.731
<v Speaker 1>understand Adams in the second scene was</v>
<v Speaker 1>merely a blank canvas that we attached,</v>

37
00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:28.630
<v Speaker 1>meaning to</v>

38
00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:29.463
<v Speaker 2>montage means the assembly of pieces of </v>
<v Speaker 2>film which moved in rapid succession </v>

39
00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.830
<v Speaker 2>before the I create an idea</v>

40
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.003
<v Speaker 1>what separates Ville knew from many </v>
<v Speaker 1>other filmmakers is his ability to </v>

41
00:02:42.891 --> 00:02:46.910
<v Speaker 1>generate ideas with cinematic craft.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then on another level,</v>

42
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:47.773
<v Speaker 1>mingle those ideas collide and blend </v>
<v Speaker 1>them to create a higher order of </v>

43
00:02:51.381 --> 00:02:53.690
<v Speaker 1>meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the meaning,</v>

44
00:02:53.691 --> 00:02:54.524
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that bill knew suggests with this </v>

45
00:02:55.881 --> 00:03:00.881
<v Speaker 1>coolest job effect experiment perhaps </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the future can influence the past.</v>

46
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:02.403
<v Speaker 1>That's certainly a reasonable thing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>derive from this kind of experience in </v>

47
00:03:05.381 --> 00:03:06.430
<v Speaker 1>the film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

48
00:03:06.431 --> 00:03:07.264
<v Speaker 1>it's an idea that turns out to be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>key to the climax of arrival as Adam's </v>

49
00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:11.314
<v Speaker 1>learns that the aliens are higher </v>
<v Speaker 1>dimensional beings that can see all of </v>

50
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:15.723
<v Speaker 1>time at once and uses that skill to </v>
<v Speaker 1>access future events to influence her </v>

51
00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:21.263
<v Speaker 1>present,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you could also read another meaning </v>

52
00:03:26.951 --> 00:03:27.784
<v Speaker 1>from the same experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Namely that communication is limited by </v>

53
00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.660
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From our perspective at the beginning of</v>

54
00:03:34.661 --> 00:03:35.494
<v Speaker 1>the film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything tells us that Adams is </v>

55
00:03:37.451 --> 00:03:38.284
<v Speaker 1>grieving.</v>

56
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.780
<v Speaker 1>Only later did we learn that that wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>

57
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:41.703
<v Speaker 1>It's to is a major theme of a rifle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The limits of human communication are </v>

58
00:03:45.911 --> 00:03:49.090
<v Speaker 1>reinforced and expanded upon in probe </v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout the film,</v>

59
00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.840
<v Speaker 1>the limits of our biology of relying on </v>
<v Speaker 1>what our census report,</v>

60
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.580
<v Speaker 1>the limits imposed on us by our culture </v>
<v Speaker 1>or our own personalities.</v>

61
00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:58.443
<v Speaker 1>Trust me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can understand communication and </v>

62
00:04:00.941 --> 00:04:03.550
<v Speaker 1>still ended up staying in conversation </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the aliens.</v>

63
00:04:03.551 --> 00:04:06.580
<v Speaker 1>Communication is literally imagined as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>screen,</v>

64
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.900
<v Speaker 1>a mediator that blurs intention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now screens can connect us.</v>

65
00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.320
<v Speaker 1>They can also divide us and it's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same with communication.</v>

66
00:04:14.321 --> 00:04:17.260
<v Speaker 1>Communication is a link between two </v>
<v Speaker 1>parties,</v>

67
00:04:17.261 --> 00:04:20.050
<v Speaker 1>but it's a link that often facilitates a</v>
<v Speaker 1>split</v>

68
00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.113
<v Speaker 3>language is the foundation of </v>
<v Speaker 3>civilization use glue that holds people </v>

69
00:04:24.631 --> 00:04:27.720
<v Speaker 3>together is the first weapon drawn into </v>
<v Speaker 3>conflict.</v>

70
00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.240
<v Speaker 3>We are falling asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't up people.</v>

71
00:04:30.241 --> 00:04:32.100
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know you do.</v>

72
00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.190
<v Speaker 1>What's important here is not that both </v>
<v Speaker 1>these readings are valid,</v>

73
00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.173
<v Speaker 1>they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that both have echoes elsewhere in </v>

74
00:04:37.651 --> 00:04:40.380
<v Speaker 1>the film and echo off each other a </v>
<v Speaker 1>theme.</v>

75
00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.400
<v Speaker 1>Once introduced isn't wasted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the alien language is circular,</v>

76
00:04:44.401 --> 00:04:45.234
<v Speaker 1>so the film is to the difficulty of </v>
<v Speaker 1>cooperation in the small group at the </v>

77
00:04:48.451 --> 00:04:49.284
<v Speaker 1>Montana site,</v>
<v Speaker 1>echoes the difficulty of cooperation </v>

78
00:04:51.241 --> 00:04:52.074
<v Speaker 1>between nations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Louise's understanding of her </v>

79
00:04:53.971 --> 00:04:54.804
<v Speaker 1>displacement in time happens </v>
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously with the audiences </v>

80
00:04:57.631 --> 00:05:00.600
<v Speaker 1>realization that the events depicted </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't linear,</v>

81
00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:01.463
<v Speaker 1>non zero sum game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every theme is filtered through other </v>

82
00:05:04.171 --> 00:05:05.004
<v Speaker 1>moments and characters and eventually </v>
<v Speaker 1>other themes until it starts to feel </v>

83
00:05:08.371 --> 00:05:09.204
<v Speaker 1>like something solid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You start to think what is the </v>

84
00:05:11.701 --> 00:05:16.701
<v Speaker 1>relationship between language and time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's that the mind is not a thing,</v>

85
00:05:17.311 --> 00:05:20.370
<v Speaker 1>but a process language happening in </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

86
00:05:20.371 --> 00:05:24.210
<v Speaker 1>Just like film is communication </v>
<v Speaker 1>occurring in time.</v>

87
00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.760
<v Speaker 1>You had noise in schools anymore.</v>

88
00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:36.040
<v Speaker 3>A Muslim is video,</v>

89
00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:41.580
<v Speaker 1>so much of arrival seems to be about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility of meaning in film.</v>

90
00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:43.470
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where does it come from?</v>

91
00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.700
<v Speaker 1>I think Villeneuve imagines it as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>alien spacecraft,</v>

92
00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:49.410
<v Speaker 1>mysterious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obscure,</v>

93
00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:50.693
<v Speaker 1>and expression that's not quite written </v>
<v Speaker 1>or spoken language and so always </v>

94
00:05:53.851 --> 00:05:54.684
<v Speaker 1>difficult to decipher something when </v>
<v Speaker 1>born out of craft and character and </v>

95
00:05:58.431 --> 00:06:03.431
<v Speaker 1>story is always hovering over the film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always in the background scene from</v>

96
00:06:03.771 --> 00:06:06.260
<v Speaker 1>different angles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>impossible to avoid.</v>

97
00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:11.510
<v Speaker 1>Arrival isn't just a repudiation of bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>movies because it leads by example.</v>

98
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:12.860
<v Speaker 1>It's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

99
00:06:12.861 --> 00:06:16.850
<v Speaker 1>an active exploration into what makes a </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie great.</v>

100
00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.933
<v Speaker 1>It explores the kind of unique </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective that a film can gift to the </v>

101
00:06:21.831 --> 00:06:26.831
<v Speaker 1>film goer like a language gifted by </v>
<v Speaker 1>aliens and what kind of brand new world.</v>

102
00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.430
<v Speaker 1>That perspective allows us to see.</v>

103
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:42.590
<v Speaker 4>Hey everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thanks for watching.</v>
