00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.070
<v Speaker 1>What did you do to me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your body won't last long in,</v>

2
00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.260
<v Speaker 1>stuck in there for the rest of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

3
00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.010
<v Speaker 1>You'll get me out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You son of up and down her cat.</v>

4
00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.120
<v Speaker 1>I hate cats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crappy movies suck.</v>

5
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.133
<v Speaker 1>Obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate to waste my money or my time on </v>

6
00:00:16.151 --> 00:00:19.630
<v Speaker 1>something that is truly bad like suicide</v>
<v Speaker 1>squad,</v>

7
00:00:19.631 --> 00:00:24.250
<v Speaker 1>that where every decision seems to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>made for maximum shit.</v>

8
00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.760
<v Speaker 1>He tells me a whole lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a shame,</v>

9
00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:28.773
<v Speaker 1>but in the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think crappy movies are an inevitable </v>

10
00:00:30.671 --> 00:00:31.504
<v Speaker 1>part of the cinematic ecosystem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not ever going to get away from </v>

11
00:00:34.181 --> 00:00:37.300
<v Speaker 1>them and whether or not they make money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of which unfortunately do.</v>

12
00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:41.440
<v Speaker 1>No one is setting out to make a movie </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is a piece of crap.</v>

13
00:00:41.441 --> 00:00:43.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about a completely plus </v>
<v Speaker 1>bottle</v>

14
00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.480
<v Speaker 2>cough syrup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like six bucks.</v>

15
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.110
<v Speaker 1>What's more insidious in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are movies that are just passable.</v>

16
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.630
<v Speaker 1>Films just good enough not to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible.</v>

17
00:00:57.631 --> 00:00:59.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean passable films,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they aren't bad.</v>

18
00:00:59.491 --> 00:01:00.324
<v Speaker 1>They might even be better than okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are a far cry from great or </v>

19
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.103
<v Speaker 1>noteworthy or something that you would </v>
<v Speaker 1>like to see more than once that the </v>

20
00:01:06.571 --> 00:01:10.440
<v Speaker 1>cinematic equivalent of this image,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't fall apart,</v>

21
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.090
<v Speaker 1>but their balance is always precarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the last handful of years,</v>

22
00:01:15.091 --> 00:01:15.924
<v Speaker 1>my annoyance with passable movies has </v>
<v Speaker 1>steadily increased in proportion with </v>

23
00:01:18.961 --> 00:01:22.920
<v Speaker 1>their steadily increasing number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Passable films like to multiply.</v>

24
00:01:22.921 --> 00:01:23.754
<v Speaker 1>They do just enough for the audience and</v>
<v Speaker 1>just enough for the studio and just </v>

25
00:01:26.161 --> 00:01:29.640
<v Speaker 1>enough for the stars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have no problem being funded.</v>

26
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.593
<v Speaker 1>Stop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop.</v>

27
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.790
<v Speaker 1>I need to know what is happening right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

28
00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:33.743
<v Speaker 1>For a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've attributed the major problem with </v>

29
00:01:35.311 --> 00:01:39.120
<v Speaker 1>passable movies to a lack of tonal </v>
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>

30
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.800
<v Speaker 1>The emotional logic of the narrative in </v>
<v Speaker 1>films like these often often feels a bit</v>

31
00:01:43.801 --> 00:01:44.634
<v Speaker 1>out of whack either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The film tries to be too many things at </v>

32
00:01:46.771 --> 00:01:49.110
<v Speaker 1>once leading to unintended emotional </v>
<v Speaker 1>confusion.</v>

33
00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:50.550
<v Speaker 1>Don Friends as well,</v>

34
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.960
<v Speaker 2>Governor Nix this unit has been </v>
<v Speaker 2>authorized,</v>

35
00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.440
<v Speaker 2>is pristinely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's enough.</v>

36
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:10.390
<v Speaker 2>That's enough</v>

37
00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.440
<v Speaker 1>for the filmmakers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give characters traits that don't belong</v>

38
00:02:13.441 --> 00:02:15.690
<v Speaker 1>to them in order to serve some plot </v>
<v Speaker 1>function.</v>

39
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.200
<v Speaker 1>What has it been this they're so fun to </v>
<v Speaker 1>watch without the end?</v>

40
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.333
<v Speaker 1>Many millions of people with no what and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just the first two weeks of </v>

41
00:02:22.411 --> 00:02:26.670
<v Speaker 1>January or emotional arcs initiated </v>
<v Speaker 1>early in the story are abandoned without</v>

42
00:02:26.671 --> 00:02:27.504
<v Speaker 1>comment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>often proving in the end to be entirely </v>

43
00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:34.490
<v Speaker 1>pointless in good movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything points to everything else.</v>

44
00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.240
<v Speaker 1>Emotional arcs of the characters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the scenes,</v>

45
00:02:43.241 --> 00:02:44.074
<v Speaker 1>the imagery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the music and the plot are tightly </v>

46
00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.990
<v Speaker 1>entwined and this doesn't just go for </v>
<v Speaker 1>high brow movies by the way,</v>

47
00:02:49.991 --> 00:02:50.824
<v Speaker 1>whenever you hear someone say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a lower brow film that it knows </v>

48
00:02:53.801 --> 00:02:54.634
<v Speaker 1>what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What they're really saying is that the </v>

49
00:02:56.201 --> 00:02:57.034
<v Speaker 1>film was totally focused,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but recently I've begun to notice </v>

50
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.190
<v Speaker 1>another unifying feature of passable </v>
<v Speaker 1>movies.</v>

51
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:07.383
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of all passable storytelling and to </v>

52
00:03:09.101 --> 00:03:10.940
<v Speaker 1>understand what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take a look at.</v>

53
00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.170
<v Speaker 3>I gotta say feels really good to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody looking out for me.</v>

54
00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.600
<v Speaker 3>I got your back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like that,</v>

55
00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.890
<v Speaker 3>and I got your back too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey Doug.</v>

56
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.800
<v Speaker 3>I like you man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

57
00:03:29.801 --> 00:03:31.840
<v Speaker 3>A great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just want you to remember that this is</v>

58
00:03:31.841 --> 00:03:34.660
<v Speaker 3>a business relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't mean that we're going to be best</v>

59
00:03:34.661 --> 00:03:35.494
<v Speaker 3>friends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not how this story is just an </v>

60
00:03:37.391 --> 00:03:39.240
<v Speaker 3>employee with a job to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got it.</v>

61
00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.860
<v Speaker 3>My best friend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're just my best man.</v>

62
00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.620
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean that we're not going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a good time though I sat,</v>

63
00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.310
<v Speaker 1>I got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're anybody's best friend for price,</v>

64
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.080
<v Speaker 1>but nobody's winning account.</v>

65
00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.050
<v Speaker 1>All the beats in the short scene should </v>
<v Speaker 1>be familiar to us.</v>

66
00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.370
<v Speaker 1>We've seen them all before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's something odd going on here.</v>

67
00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:02.473
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stories are almost always about people </v>

68
00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.013
<v Speaker 1>or aliens or gods or animals or robots </v>
<v Speaker 1>that act like people and great stories </v>

69
00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.250
<v Speaker 1>are always the ones that observed people</v>
<v Speaker 1>truthfully,</v>

70
00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:14.473
<v Speaker 1>the ones that capture human experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>with nuance and insight and the best </v>

71
00:04:17.871 --> 00:04:18.704
<v Speaker 1>stories make such acute observations </v>
<v Speaker 1>about humanity that they can show us </v>

72
00:04:21.111 --> 00:04:25.400
<v Speaker 1>things about ourselves that we didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know or teach us how to articulate those</v>

73
00:04:25.401 --> 00:04:29.180
<v Speaker 1>things against a vast unintelligible </v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety,</v>

74
00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:35.020
<v Speaker 1>and this I think is the big difference </v>
<v Speaker 1>between great movies and passable ones.</v>

75
00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.270
<v Speaker 1>When passable movies observe human </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience,</v>

76
00:04:38.271 --> 00:04:41.450
<v Speaker 1>they observe it not through the lens of </v>
<v Speaker 1>real life,</v>

77
00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.800
<v Speaker 1>but through the lens of other movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Love is my life.</v>

78
00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.510
<v Speaker 1>No love is your job.</v>

79
00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:50.543
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're threatened by what zoe </v>

80
00:04:51.281 --> 00:04:53.800
<v Speaker 1>and I have because you're afraid I won't</v>
<v Speaker 1>be able to hang out every night.</v>

81
00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.240
<v Speaker 1>You were my drug dealer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's one reason we know each other.</v>

82
00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.670
<v Speaker 1>I like the drugs you sell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

83
00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.830
<v Speaker 1>There is this huge library,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this huge vocabulary of actions built up</v>

84
00:05:05.831 --> 00:05:09.250
<v Speaker 1>over the years that people you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't really do,</v>

85
00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:10.203
<v Speaker 1>but which happens so often in TV and </v>
<v Speaker 1>movies that they're familiar enough to </v>

86
00:05:13.301 --> 00:05:17.800
<v Speaker 1>an audience that they become well </v>
<v Speaker 1>passable for human motivations.</v>

87
00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying it's bad for filmmakers </v>
<v Speaker 1>to site or pay homage to the movies that</v>

88
00:05:22.541 --> 00:05:23.374
<v Speaker 1>they love in their own work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying that too many films released </v>

89
00:05:26.531 --> 00:05:27.364
<v Speaker 1>today are being cobbled together from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>weird alternate reality that is only a </v>

90
00:05:32.111 --> 00:05:36.400
<v Speaker 1>dim echo of our own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does not believe in fairy tales about</v>

91
00:05:36.401 --> 00:05:41.401
<v Speaker 1>Chakras or energy with a power belief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no such thing as spirit.</v>

92
00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:46.660
<v Speaker 1>This is the longterm danger of cliche.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The more we allow it to happen,</v>

93
00:05:46.661 --> 00:05:47.494
<v Speaker 1>the harder it is to escape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more difficult it is for audiences </v>

94
00:05:50.411 --> 00:05:55.270
<v Speaker 1>and writers to tell the difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The last thing we want is to see our own</v>

95
00:05:55.271 --> 00:05:58.880
<v Speaker 1>lives through the Lens of art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's only passable.</v>

96
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:00.103
<v Speaker 1>New perspectives are what we need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Originality is what we should encourage </v>

97
00:06:03.001 --> 00:06:04.880
<v Speaker 1>you at every chance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise,</v>

98
00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:09.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm afraid our movies and ourselves will</v>
<v Speaker 1>change into something quite different.</v>

99
00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.900
<v Speaker 1>What's it called?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The imitation game.</v>
