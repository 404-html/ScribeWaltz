1
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:15.890
<v Speaker 1>Who was the first person to ever have </v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of traveling through time?</v>

2
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.513
<v Speaker 1>If I had to guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd say it was probably an early human </v>

3
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:20.693
<v Speaker 1>tens of thousands of years ago who </v>
<v Speaker 1>stubbed his toe or tripped or lit his </v>

4
00:00:24.271 --> 00:00:27.600
<v Speaker 1>hair on fire and in searing pain had the</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>

5
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.170
<v Speaker 1>I wish I would have not done that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this really limited way.</v>

6
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.440
<v Speaker 1>Time travel as an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably as old as regret,</v>

7
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.350
<v Speaker 1>which is to say as old as humanity </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself,</v>

8
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.273
<v Speaker 1>human beings have an instinctive sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>for cause and effect and a particular </v>

9
00:00:42.271 --> 00:00:43.104
<v Speaker 1>skill for manipulating causes to get the</v>
<v Speaker 1>effects that they want and it makes </v>

10
00:00:47.131 --> 00:00:47.964
<v Speaker 1>sense that are wandering minds would </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at the effects of what's already </v>

11
00:00:50.581 --> 00:00:51.414
<v Speaker 1>happened in wonder what things might </v>
<v Speaker 1>look like if the causes had been </v>

12
00:00:54.661 --> 00:00:57.390
<v Speaker 1>different somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which makes it kind of weird that time.</v>

13
00:00:57.391 --> 00:01:02.280
<v Speaker 1>Travel as a device to tell stories is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively recent phenomenon.</v>

14
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:03.463
<v Speaker 1>It might not seem that way since </v>
<v Speaker 1>traveling through time is such a staple </v>

15
00:01:05.641 --> 00:01:08.700
<v Speaker 1>of modern science fiction and really the</v>
<v Speaker 1>modern imagination.</v>

16
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.050
<v Speaker 1>We've been so saturated with time </v>
<v Speaker 1>traveling novels and TV shows and movies</v>

17
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.213
<v Speaker 1>that the average person pretty much </v>
<v Speaker 1>understands all the basic concepts and </v>

18
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.323
<v Speaker 1>paradox,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the time travel genre is only about </v>

19
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.230
<v Speaker 1>100 years old and change depending on </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you mark the beginning.</v>

20
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.790
<v Speaker 1>Many people see hg wells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time machine in 1895 as the start of</v>

21
00:01:29.791 --> 00:01:32.130
<v Speaker 1>the genre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Others look to mark Twain's,</v>

22
00:01:32.131 --> 00:01:35.460
<v Speaker 1>a Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's </v>
<v Speaker 1>court from a few years later.</v>

23
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.473
<v Speaker 1>Some even cite Charles Dickens' a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christmas carol with it's ghost of </v>

24
00:01:39.061 --> 00:01:42.150
<v Speaker 1>Christmas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>past and future from 1843.</v>

25
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.463
<v Speaker 1>The truth is you can't really pinpoint a</v>
<v Speaker 1>specific novel as the genesis of time </v>

26
00:01:46.951 --> 00:01:51.390
<v Speaker 1>travel fiction because the genre doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>pop into existence out of nowhere,</v>

27
00:01:51.391 --> 00:01:56.391
<v Speaker 1>like Cyborg from the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It grew slowly from the ashes of a genre</v>

28
00:01:56.581 --> 00:01:57.414
<v Speaker 1>that no one really knows about anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to understand that there is one </v>

29
00:02:01.111 --> 00:02:05.010
<v Speaker 1>specific book you can mention in more </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways than one.</v>

30
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.903
<v Speaker 1>Charles Darwin's on the origin of </v>
<v Speaker 1>species triggered a sea change in </v>

31
00:02:09.541 --> 00:02:13.350
<v Speaker 1>science and culture after origin was </v>
<v Speaker 1>published in 1859.</v>

32
00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.213
<v Speaker 1>The idea of evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily the idea of natural </v>

33
00:02:16.861 --> 00:02:20.490
<v Speaker 1>selection was adopted fast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really fast,</v>

34
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:21.533
<v Speaker 1>just a decade later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolution was assumed at several top </v>

35
00:02:24.571 --> 00:02:27.840
<v Speaker 1>universities and it filtered down into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the popular consciousness.</v>

36
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.140
<v Speaker 1>It colored the way people thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just about biology,</v>

37
00:02:31.141 --> 00:02:31.974
<v Speaker 1>but about sociology too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If species we're getting fitter and </v>

38
00:02:35.551 --> 00:02:36.780
<v Speaker 1>fitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>better and better.</v>

39
00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.003
<v Speaker 1>Why not societies?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in this period that a certain kind </v>

40
00:02:40.501 --> 00:02:41.334
<v Speaker 1>of novel becomes really popular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called the Utopian Romance and it </v>

41
00:02:46.231 --> 00:02:49.260
<v Speaker 1>culminates in Edward Bellamy's 1888 </v>
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>

42
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.393
<v Speaker 1>looking backward in Bellamy's book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hero Julian West falls into a deep </v>

43
00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.820
<v Speaker 1>hypnotic sleep and wakes up 113 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>later in the year 2000.</v>

44
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.710
<v Speaker 1>The world is totally changed into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>socialist utopia.</v>

45
00:03:02.711 --> 00:03:03.544
<v Speaker 1>Essentially Bellamy's version of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect society evolved out of the </v>

46
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:08.673
<v Speaker 1>Society of his own day.</v>

47
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:09.813
<v Speaker 1>The book was a huge success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second novel in all of American </v>

48
00:03:12.671 --> 00:03:16.390
<v Speaker 1>literature to sell over a million copies</v>
<v Speaker 1>like successful things do,</v>

49
00:03:16.391 --> 00:03:17.224
<v Speaker 1>it exploded the genre,</v>
<v Speaker 1>resulting in dozens and dozens of </v>

50
00:03:19.391 --> 00:03:20.224
<v Speaker 1>Utopian stories written along a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>similar structure and with evolution as </v>

51
00:03:23.921 --> 00:03:24.754
<v Speaker 1>the guiding principle utopias,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're no longer on a last island or a </v>

52
00:03:28.331 --> 00:03:29.164
<v Speaker 1>different world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were in the future in his </v>

53
00:03:33.761 --> 00:03:35.650
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary book on time travel </v>
<v Speaker 1>fiction,</v>

54
00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:36.513
<v Speaker 1>David Wittenberg shows that overtime the</v>
<v Speaker 1>utopian romance became really </v>

55
00:03:40.061 --> 00:03:43.360
<v Speaker 1>preoccupied with how its heroes got to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the future.</v>

56
00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.840
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the time people fell asleep and</v>
<v Speaker 1>woke up years later.</v>

57
00:03:46.841 --> 00:03:47.674
<v Speaker 1>Other times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people's minds were sent forward and </v>

58
00:03:49.691 --> 00:03:52.870
<v Speaker 1>were able to come back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People traveled to the future in hot air</v>

59
00:03:52.871 --> 00:03:53.704
<v Speaker 1>balloons by lightening storms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even once with the use of a special </v>

60
00:03:57.011 --> 00:03:58.300
<v Speaker 1>shampoo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

61
00:03:58.301 --> 00:04:02.080
<v Speaker 1>when hg wells solves the problem with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mechanical time machine,</v>

62
00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:03.123
<v Speaker 1>he's doing it for the same reason as </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody else to create a realistic </v>

63
00:04:06.401 --> 00:04:09.760
<v Speaker 1>frame for his own Utopian story or in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this case,</v>

64
00:04:09.761 --> 00:04:12.230
<v Speaker 1>his criticism and satire of that shot.</v>

65
00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:13.563
<v Speaker 1>Eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Utopian craze fell under the weight </v>

66
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.750
<v Speaker 1>of its own propaganda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today barely anyone reads or writes that</v>

67
00:04:19.751 --> 00:04:24.490
<v Speaker 1>kind of fiction and nobody knows the </v>
<v Speaker 1>name of the author or the book that sold</v>

68
00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.780
<v Speaker 1>a million copies 100 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as Utopian fiction collapsed,</v>

69
00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.370
<v Speaker 1>it left us with a framing device that </v>
<v Speaker 1>grew into its own genre.</v>

70
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.900
<v Speaker 1>That's where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or rather when time travel fiction as we</v>

71
00:04:37.901 --> 00:04:40.360
<v Speaker 1>know it comes from in the following </v>
<v Speaker 1>decades,</v>

72
00:04:40.361 --> 00:04:43.870
<v Speaker 1>the genre would be transformed by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>discoveries of Einstein.</v>

73
00:04:43.871 --> 00:04:44.704
<v Speaker 1>It would use a popular understanding of </v>
<v Speaker 1>space time to probe the paradoxes of </v>

74
00:04:48.251 --> 00:04:51.040
<v Speaker 1>causality that we've all become so </v>
<v Speaker 1>familiar with,</v>

75
00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:52.083
<v Speaker 1>but is Wittenberg notes time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Travel fiction is essentially the child </v>

76
00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.110
<v Speaker 1>of narrative itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Examining the nature of causality is the</v>

77
00:04:59.111 --> 00:04:59.944
<v Speaker 1>same thing as examining the nature of </v>
<v Speaker 1>story because that's what a story is </v>

78
00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.010
<v Speaker 1>caused an effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's white time travel.</v>

79
00:05:06.011 --> 00:05:08.650
<v Speaker 1>Movies and books are obsessed with </v>
<v Speaker 1>rules.</v>

80
00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.170
<v Speaker 1>They're like laboratories of </v>
<v Speaker 1>storytelling.</v>

81
00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:14.650
<v Speaker 1>Just create a world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>establish its rules,</v>

82
00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.040
<v Speaker 1>and to ask what's possible.</v>

83
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:26.080
<v Speaker 1>Hey everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you so much for watching.</v>

84
00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.490
<v Speaker 1>This episode was sponsored by the new </v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube red original series,</v>

85
00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.590
<v Speaker 1>lifeline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the first,</v>

86
00:05:32.591 --> 00:05:33.424
<v Speaker 1>the very first Saifai narrative series </v>
<v Speaker 1>that red has produced about a company </v>

87
00:05:37.061 --> 00:05:37.894
<v Speaker 1>called lifeline that sends its agents </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the future to save clients that </v>

88
00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:42.753
<v Speaker 1>they know are going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a really great concept and </v>

89
00:05:45.281 --> 00:05:49.750
<v Speaker 1>personally I'm super excited that red is</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually green lighting shows like this.</v>

90
00:05:49.751 --> 00:05:52.810
<v Speaker 1>I hope the future brings more by </v>
<v Speaker 1>talented creators.</v>

91
00:05:52.811 --> 00:05:53.644
