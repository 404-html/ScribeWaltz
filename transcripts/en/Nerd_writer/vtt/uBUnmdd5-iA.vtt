1
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.213
<v Speaker 1>Generally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the attitude with which humor is </v>

2
00:00:31.781 --> 00:00:33.430
<v Speaker 1>towed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I enjoy</v>

3
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.450
<v Speaker 2>that little bit of slapstick comedy by </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Great Rowan Atkinson is as simple as</v>

4
00:00:56.451 --> 00:00:59.420
<v Speaker 2>it gets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unsuspecting man walks into a tree.</v>

5
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.853
<v Speaker 2>It's probably the most famous bit from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the late 1970 [inaudible] sketch show </v>

6
00:01:03.051 --> 00:01:05.450
<v Speaker 2>that Atkinson starting called not the </v>
<v Speaker 2>9:00</v>

7
00:01:05.451 --> 00:01:09.470
<v Speaker 2>news and what elevates it beyond a </v>
<v Speaker 2>simple joke is the same thing that makes</v>

8
00:01:09.471 --> 00:01:13.970
<v Speaker 2>Atkinson one of the world's most gifted </v>
<v Speaker 2>physical comedians attitude.</v>

9
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.240
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at this sweet little man noticing a</v>

10
00:01:17.241 --> 00:01:21.980
<v Speaker 2>camera being self conscious at first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just at the moment he starts to feel</v>

11
00:01:21.981 --> 00:01:24.440
<v Speaker 2>a little bit special.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's undercut.</v>

12
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.150
<v Speaker 2>Atkinson has the chops of the very best </v>
<v Speaker 2>physical comedians like Charlie Chaplin,</v>

13
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.100
<v Speaker 2>Buster Keaton or shock dot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what sets them apart I think is this</v>

14
00:01:34.101 --> 00:01:38.270
<v Speaker 2>natural gift for characterization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nonverbal characterization,</v>

15
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.270
<v Speaker 2>not just the ability to do funny things </v>
<v Speaker 2>physically,</v>

16
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.380
<v Speaker 2>but the ability to use that physicality </v>
<v Speaker 2>to broadcast and attitude.</v>

17
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.290
<v Speaker 2>The things that make me laugh on </v>
<v Speaker 2>characters,</v>

18
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.133
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's people who kind of present a sort </v>

19
00:01:50.241 --> 00:01:51.200
<v Speaker 2>of truth to.</v>

20
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.103
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though it's mad or it's funny or </v>

21
00:01:53.091 --> 00:01:55.760
<v Speaker 2>it's wacky or it's rude or it's or it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>silly,</v>

22
00:01:55.761 --> 00:01:58.880
<v Speaker 2>but there's a sort of a truth there that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you identify with.</v>

23
00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.910
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most people know Atkinson as Mr Bean,</v>

24
00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.080
<v Speaker 2>the globally famous character he created</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's mostly wordless antics,</v>

25
00:02:06.081 --> 00:02:08.660
<v Speaker 2>call back to the visual comedy of silent</v>
<v Speaker 2>films.</v>

26
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.650
<v Speaker 2>Most Americans probably know him from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the being feature films that came later,</v>

27
00:02:12.651 --> 00:02:13.484
<v Speaker 2>but the original Sitcom which ran for </v>
<v Speaker 2>only 15 episodes across six years is </v>

28
00:02:17.811 --> 00:02:18.644
<v Speaker 2>where the best being work is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's generally because the more </v>

29
00:02:21.861 --> 00:02:24.320
<v Speaker 2>cinematic the format,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the less interesting Mr.</v>

30
00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.590
<v Speaker 2>Bean becomes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Atkinson doesn't need much more than the</v>

31
00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.980
<v Speaker 2>single two shot to work wonders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unlike Chaplin Keaton,</v>

32
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.580
<v Speaker 2>Atkinson isn't a director.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a performer through</v>

33
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.200
<v Speaker 1>this is hell no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am the devil.</v>

34
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.023
<v Speaker 1>Good evening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you couldn't call me toby if you </v>

35
00:02:44.481 --> 00:02:49.070
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We tried to keep things informal here as</v>

36
00:02:49.071 --> 00:02:54.071
<v Speaker 1>well as infertile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just a little joke is why</v>

37
00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.750
<v Speaker 2>I think Atkinson's purist and often work</v>
<v Speaker 2>is in his stage shows no frills,</v>

38
00:03:02.141 --> 00:03:02.974
<v Speaker 2>just a man and his audience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These shows make the most of Atkinson's </v>

39
00:03:05.711 --> 00:03:07.630
<v Speaker 2>talents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The skits are funny,</v>

40
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.950
<v Speaker 2>but the attitude in which they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>performed is the</v>

41
00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.280
<v Speaker 1>Jordan tried to keep things in full here</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well as in fertile.</v>

42
00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.700
<v Speaker 1>That's just a little joke on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on names,</v>

43
00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:30.710
<v Speaker 1>anus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>

44
00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.650
<v Speaker 3>I'm a dick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a dick.</v>

45
00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:45.763
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of prospective brides asked me </v>

46
00:03:48.381 --> 00:03:50.570
<v Speaker 1>these days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>father,</v>

47
00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.410
<v Speaker 1>what is the church's attitude to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fellatio?</v>

48
00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:03.373
<v Speaker 1>And I tend to reply by telling them a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little story about the first time I was </v>

49
00:04:07.281 --> 00:04:08.114
<v Speaker 1>asked that question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All jokes that require the performer to </v>

50
00:04:14.631 --> 00:04:16.580
<v Speaker 1>strike the exact right tone</v>

51
00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.860
<v Speaker 2>because it's the character that makes </v>
<v Speaker 2>them work,</v>

52
00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:19.793
<v Speaker 2>not the punchlines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the way this freeze cracks the </v>

53
00:04:21.811 --> 00:04:24.270
<v Speaker 2>communion wafer and dips it into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>wine.</v>

54
00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:25.283
<v Speaker 2>It's the dead pan seriousness of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>school master doing a totally absurd </v>

55
00:04:28.921 --> 00:04:31.680
<v Speaker 2>roll call.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the way the devil drops his head to</v>

56
00:04:31.681 --> 00:04:36.681
<v Speaker 2>the side with a bit of self deprecation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The character is the joke.</v>

57
00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:50.770
<v Speaker 1>This is the comedy personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not about doing funny things.</v>

58
00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:57.620
<v Speaker 1>It's about doing something quite normal </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a funny way</v>

59
00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:02.480
<v Speaker 2>that's actually Atkinson himself acting </v>
<v Speaker 2>in narrating a documentary,</v>

60
00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:06.350
<v Speaker 2>really along video essay on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>principles of visual comedy.</v>

61
00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:07.513
<v Speaker 2>I'll link to it below.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely watched the whole thing in </v>

62
00:05:09.441 --> 00:05:10.274
<v Speaker 2>describing the comedy of personality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Atkinson is describing what excites him </v>

63
00:05:13.701 --> 00:05:15.710
<v Speaker 2>the most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also what he's the best app.</v>

64
00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.873
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you were to take the comedy of </v>

65
00:05:17.781 --> 00:05:18.614
<v Speaker 2>personality to its most extreme,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he probably get a sketch like this one </v>

66
00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:23.413
<v Speaker 2>where Atkinson gives an acting lecture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>portraying a bunch of different </v>

67
00:05:26.361 --> 00:05:27.194
<v Speaker 2>personalities,</v>

68
00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.550
<v Speaker 1>Imessenger and just bearing good news</v>

69
00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:39.470
<v Speaker 3>I mentioned to inches</v>

70
00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:41.460
<v Speaker 1>bad news</v>

71
00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:48.230
<v Speaker 3>messenger</v>

72
00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:51.410
<v Speaker 1>and just burying bad news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which he thinks is good news.</v>

73
00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:59.343
<v Speaker 2>There's really no joke at all here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just personalities and personalities </v>

74
00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.113
<v Speaker 2>within personalities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Atkinson is playing his self serious </v>

75
00:06:06.311 --> 00:06:07.144
<v Speaker 2>actor playing various different parts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The actor is proudly displaying his </v>

76
00:06:10.631 --> 00:06:12.280
<v Speaker 2>talent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when something goes wrong,</v>

77
00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:13.480
<v Speaker 2>we get a glimpse of</v>

78
00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:14.513
<v Speaker 3>character underneath and it's even funny</v>
<v Speaker 3>to really grasp and audience with </v>

79
00:06:18.511 --> 00:06:19.050
<v Speaker 3>comedy.</v>

80
00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:19.883
<v Speaker 2>This takes enormous precision and those </v>
<v Speaker 2>who can do it have a style that is </v>

81
00:06:23.281 --> 00:06:24.114
<v Speaker 2>completely inimitable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is sort of ironic since being a </v>

82
00:06:26.671 --> 00:06:27.504
<v Speaker 2>physical comedian requires a mastery of </v>
<v Speaker 2>invitation and a minute study of human </v>

83
00:06:31.831 --> 00:06:32.664
<v Speaker 2>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These comedians find comedy in the </v>

84
00:06:34.471 --> 00:06:35.304
<v Speaker 2>slightest things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way someone flicks a wrist or the </v>

85
00:06:38.461 --> 00:06:39.294
<v Speaker 2>way someone pronounces the first letter </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a word and he knew we're feels a </v>

86
00:06:46.861 --> 00:06:51.470
<v Speaker 2>single piano note.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're signifies a whole nationality with</v>

87
00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:52.313
<v Speaker 2>the tiniest</v>

88
00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:53.483
<v Speaker 1>as well as the Russians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Generally the things that make me laugh </v>

89
00:07:02.751 --> 00:07:03.830
<v Speaker 1>or characters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

90
00:07:03.831 --> 00:07:07.430
<v Speaker 1>it's people who kind of present a sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of truth to you.</v>

91
00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:10.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean even though it's mad or it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>funny or it's wacky or it's rude or it's</v>

92
00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:13.970
<v Speaker 1>though it's silly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a sort of a truth there that</v>

93
00:07:13.971 --> 00:07:18.950
<v Speaker 1>you identify with and you think that </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation I've been there,</v>

94
00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:19.823
<v Speaker 1>I've seen someone like that on the train</v>
<v Speaker 1>or I am someone like that and I prefer </v>

95
00:07:25.281 --> 00:07:27.260
<v Speaker 1>to keep it hidden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yet here,</v>

96
00:07:27.261 --> 00:07:32.261
<v Speaker 1>here I am being characterized extremely </v>
<v Speaker 1>well and that's</v>

97
00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.033
<v Speaker 2>one of the questions you guys asked me </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the time is what kind of software I </v>

98
00:07:58.651 --> 00:07:59.484
<v Speaker 2>use to make these videos will to edit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I use final cut pro 10 and since 10 is </v>

99
00:08:03.811 --> 00:08:06.210
<v Speaker 2>so different from the program that came </v>
<v Speaker 2>before it.</v>

100
00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:10.110
<v Speaker 2>I depended a lot on online videos to </v>
<v Speaker 2>teach me all the new features.</v>

101
00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:11.213
<v Speaker 2>These days you can pretty much teach </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself anything this way and </v>
