00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.430
<v Speaker 1>Whenever I want to learn how a movie is </v>
<v Speaker 1>put together,</v>

2
00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:04.293
<v Speaker 1>one of the first things I do is get a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pen and paper and just count the shots </v>

3
00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:09.663
<v Speaker 1>seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not very technical and it's a bit </v>

4
00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.300
<v Speaker 1>tedious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just tallying.</v>

5
00:00:13.301 --> 00:00:16.840
<v Speaker 1>Every time there's a cut forces you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>see things in a different way.</v>

6
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:17.733
<v Speaker 1>It kills the illusion just enough that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the nuts and bolts start to come into </v>

7
00:00:21.611 --> 00:00:22.750
<v Speaker 1>view.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

8
00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:27.220
<v Speaker 1>let's take a look at pt Anderson's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There will be blood already by the third</v>

9
00:00:27.221 --> 00:00:28.054
<v Speaker 1>shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I noticed a camera technique that would </v>

10
00:00:29.531 --> 00:00:31.600
<v Speaker 1>be used again and again throughout the </v>
<v Speaker 1>film.</v>

11
00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.980
<v Speaker 1>This heavy emphasis on double and triple</v>
<v Speaker 1>framing in single shots.</v>

12
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.810
<v Speaker 1>Anderson and cinematographer Robert </v>
<v Speaker 1>Elswit.</v>

13
00:00:37.811 --> 00:00:41.620
<v Speaker 1>We're clearly interested in making a </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie comprised largely of long takes,</v>

14
00:00:41.621 --> 00:00:42.454
<v Speaker 1>but they keep up the momentum by </v>
<v Speaker 1>collapsing multiple shots into one </v>

15
00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.620
<v Speaker 1>thing's never dragged on or get too </v>
<v Speaker 1>boring,</v>

16
00:00:47.621 --> 00:00:51.250
<v Speaker 1>which is definitely a consideration when</v>
<v Speaker 1>your movie is two and a half hours long.</v>

17
00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.113
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the end of the 14 and a half minute </v>

18
00:00:53.231 --> 00:00:54.700
<v Speaker 1>dialogue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>free introduction,</v>

19
00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.760
<v Speaker 1>I was struck by the length of the shots </v>
<v Speaker 1>and by how few there actually were 73 to</v>

20
00:00:59.831 --> 00:01:00.664
<v Speaker 1>be exact and 14 and a half minutes </v>
<v Speaker 1>divided by 73 means that each shot on </v>

21
00:01:04.721 --> 00:01:09.250
<v Speaker 1>average was about 12 seconds long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a really long average shot length</v>

22
00:01:09.251 --> 00:01:10.084
<v Speaker 1>by today's standard and something I </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't expecting Anderson to keep up </v>

23
00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.530
<v Speaker 1>throughout the rest of the film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This graph,</v>

24
00:01:14.531 --> 00:01:15.364
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>showing that average shotlink have </v>

25
00:01:16.661 --> 00:01:19.810
<v Speaker 1>decreased over the years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes from the work of Barry Salt,</v>

26
00:01:19.811 --> 00:01:22.990
<v Speaker 1>who's been writing about film metrics </v>
<v Speaker 1>since the sixties and seventies,</v>

27
00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.120
<v Speaker 1>and if you want to dive deeper into </v>
<v Speaker 1>metrics like these,</v>

28
00:01:25.121 --> 00:01:29.110
<v Speaker 1>I highly recommend visiting his websites</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the metrics were all kinds of data is</v>

29
00:01:29.111 --> 00:01:31.750
<v Speaker 1>listed out for literally thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 1>movies,</v>

30
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.500
<v Speaker 1>but I think the best insights come from </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing the counting yourself.</v>

31
00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:36.363
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that occurs to you </v>

32
00:01:37.361 --> 00:01:38.194
<v Speaker 1>watching there will be blood like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the value of a simple cut </v>

33
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.050
<v Speaker 1>increases as the number of cuts </v>
<v Speaker 1>decreases.</v>

34
00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:45.213
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing how impactful a cut can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're not watching them happened </v>

35
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.430
<v Speaker 1>at breakneck speed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean to say that films with more</v>

36
00:01:51.431 --> 00:01:52.264
<v Speaker 1>cuts are necessarily worse or better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just that a movie like there will be </v>

37
00:01:55.901 --> 00:01:59.200
<v Speaker 1>blood finds a lot of power in a common </v>
<v Speaker 1>cinematic device.</v>

38
00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.240
<v Speaker 1>The moment you make a decision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

39
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.900
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in stark relief to the audience and</v>

40
00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.853
<v Speaker 1>there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of a big spotlight on now </v>

41
00:02:10.391 --> 00:02:11.224
<v Speaker 1>I'm changing perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm telling you something else with </v>

42
00:02:13.151 --> 00:02:13.984
<v Speaker 1>so few cuts his ticket,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nor says the contrast of each is dialed </v>

43
00:02:16.451 --> 00:02:18.820
<v Speaker 1>up considerably and like Daniel </v>
<v Speaker 1>plainview,</v>

44
00:02:18.821 --> 00:02:21.850
<v Speaker 1>Anderson and ticket or mine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that contrast for meaning.</v>

45
00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:23.043
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times it's literal cutting </v>
<v Speaker 1>between dark frames and right frames or </v>

46
00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:27.790
<v Speaker 1>loud moments and quiet one.</v>

47
00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.990
<v Speaker 1>Just a quick side note.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This sequence right here,</v>

48
00:02:34.991 --> 00:02:36.100
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shots to 50,</v>

49
00:02:36.101 --> 00:02:36.934
<v Speaker 1>62,</v>
<v Speaker 1>63 are the quickest cutting in the film </v>

50
00:02:38.651 --> 00:02:39.484
<v Speaker 1>by Far Anderson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you so few shots that Dick nor had to </v>

51
00:02:41.861 --> 00:02:46.270
<v Speaker 1>find ways to artificially add more cuts </v>
<v Speaker 1>to build up the momentum of this moment.</v>

52
00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:47.343
<v Speaker 1>You can actually see that shots to 58 to</v>
<v Speaker 1>60 are just alternate angles of the </v>

53
00:02:50.711 --> 00:02:54.040
<v Speaker 1>shots that came before them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really good editing anyway.</v>

54
00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.933
<v Speaker 1>Other times the contrast is personal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want it to suggest that two </v>

55
00:02:57.431 --> 00:02:59.800
<v Speaker 1>characters were different sides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same coin,</v>

56
00:02:59.801 --> 00:03:00.940
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>archrivals,</v>

57
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.960
<v Speaker 1>but cut from the same cloth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All you need is two shots,</v>

58
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.050
<v Speaker 1>one tracking into a character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mumbling to himself,</v>

59
00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.200
<v Speaker 1>bathed in light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another tracking out from a character,</v>

60
00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.540
<v Speaker 1>mumbling to himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>covered in shadow.</v>

61
00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:14.613
<v Speaker 1>What I realized after a while is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a domino effect longer takes me </v>

62
00:03:17.591 --> 00:03:20.650
<v Speaker 1>more impactful cuts mean more attention </v>
<v Speaker 1>to composition,</v>

63
00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.630
<v Speaker 1>and if you want your framing to mean </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

64
00:03:22.631 --> 00:03:23.464
<v Speaker 1>then your cuts up to mean something </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the cut is where the viewer </v>

65
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.230
<v Speaker 1>really sees the framing and they see it </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a fresh memory,</v>

66
00:03:29.231 --> 00:03:32.230
<v Speaker 1>almost an after image of the frame that </v>
<v Speaker 1>came before.</v>

67
00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.093
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it is actually a memory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you want your cuts to mean </v>

68
00:03:36.191 --> 00:03:37.024
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you have to use them sparingly and </v>

69
00:03:38.741 --> 00:03:39.574
<v Speaker 1>with care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every single shot is filled with a kind </v>

70
00:03:41.771 --> 00:03:45.430
<v Speaker 1>of anticipation because these cuts are </v>
<v Speaker 1>registered consciously.</v>

71
00:03:45.431 --> 00:03:46.264
<v Speaker 1>On the viewer's mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're all waiting for the next one to </v>

72
00:03:48.221 --> 00:03:49.450
<v Speaker 1>come and everything around you.</v>

73
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.913
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

74
00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:56.423
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and knows that anticipation is just a </v>

75
00:03:57.781 --> 00:03:58.614
<v Speaker 1>form of focus and he's great at </v>
<v Speaker 1>channeling that heightened focus toward </v>

76
00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.640
<v Speaker 1>the performances and when you have an </v>
<v Speaker 1>actor as magnetic as Daniel Day Lewis,</v>

77
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:06.503
<v Speaker 1>the longer the take,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more you hang on his every word and </v>

78
00:04:09.481 --> 00:04:14.481
<v Speaker 1>pause.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see the worst in people.</v>

79
00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to look past seeing them to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get online.</v>

80
00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:22.753
<v Speaker 1>Watching this movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I noticed that conversations like this </v>

81
00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.940
<v Speaker 1>or the place with the most frequent </v>
<v Speaker 1>editing on average and necessity of shot</v>

82
00:04:28.941 --> 00:04:30.590
<v Speaker 1>reverse shot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even here,</v>

83
00:04:30.591 --> 00:04:32.810
<v Speaker 1>everything is deliberate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This sequence,</v>

84
00:04:32.811 --> 00:04:35.690
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is 16 shots in three and a half minutes.</v>

85
00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:36.773
<v Speaker 1>Take an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holds firm on the wide until Eli makes </v>

86
00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:41.580
<v Speaker 1>the key comment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it that brought you here,</v>

87
00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.870
<v Speaker 1>sir?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good Lord's guidance.</v>

88
00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.810
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>developing news.</v>

89
00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.700
<v Speaker 1>He cuts in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but only a little while.</v>

90
00:04:49.701 --> 00:04:51.710
<v Speaker 1>Daniel thinks he's still dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the father.</v>

91
00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.310
<v Speaker 1>Then when it's clear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eli is the prime negotiator.</v>

92
00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.160
<v Speaker 1>The scene locks on closeups as they </v>
<v Speaker 1>battled back and forth,</v>

93
00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:59.390
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know for sure.</v>

94
00:04:59.391 --> 00:05:00.224
<v Speaker 1>It looks a lot like ticking or extended </v>
<v Speaker 1>the silences here to augment the </v>

95
00:05:02.961 --> 00:05:03.794
<v Speaker 1>intensity.</v>

96
00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.710
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It works.</v>

97
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:09.633
<v Speaker 1>Giving the shots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>breathing room on both sides of the </v>

98
00:05:10.811 --> 00:05:12.910
<v Speaker 1>dialogue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>far from making the scene drag,</v>

99
00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:13.773
<v Speaker 1>dials up the emotion considerably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is something Henderson does </v>

100
00:05:16.121 --> 00:05:16.954
<v Speaker 1>throughout the film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Closeups are used again and again from </v>

101
00:05:19.051 --> 00:05:19.884
<v Speaker 1>moments of silence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just as much for important pieces of </v>

102
00:05:21.821 --> 00:05:23.290
<v Speaker 1>dialogue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pt Anderson,</v>

103
00:05:23.291 --> 00:05:24.124
<v Speaker 1>like the Coen brothers is great at </v>
<v Speaker 1>casting for faces and he wants us to </v>

104
00:05:27.341 --> 00:05:28.174
<v Speaker 1>watch them as much as listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course he wants us to watch </v>

105
00:05:31.271 --> 00:05:32.104
<v Speaker 1>Daniel plainview the most who corrodes </v>
<v Speaker 1>with bitterness across a series of </v>

106
00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.430
<v Speaker 1>closeups even as he finds success in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>solitude that he craves.</v>

107
00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:40.330
<v Speaker 1>I drink</v>

108
00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:45.330
<v Speaker 2>water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I drink it every day.</v>

109
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.840
<v Speaker 2>I drink the blood of flack from bandage </v>
<v Speaker 2>cracked.</v>

110
00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.310
<v Speaker 1>There are 678 shots in there will be </v>
<v Speaker 1>blood over two and a half hours.</v>

111
00:05:54.311 --> 00:05:58.340
<v Speaker 1>That means that each shot is 13 point </v>
<v Speaker 1>three seconds on average,</v>

112
00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:59.473
<v Speaker 1>more than the introduction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The movie is remarkably consistent on </v>

113
00:06:01.941 --> 00:06:02.774
<v Speaker 1>this front.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Each hour or half hour taken alone will </v>

114
00:06:04.881 --> 00:06:07.520
<v Speaker 1>average somewhere around 12 to 14 </v>
<v Speaker 1>seconds.</v>

115
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.650
<v Speaker 1>Maybe this is what gives the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's steady,</v>

116
00:06:09.651 --> 00:06:10.484
<v Speaker 1>but unrelenting pace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the feeling that you're watching a </v>

117
00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.000
<v Speaker 1>train,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't stop.</v>

121
00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:27.290

<v Speaker 1>it works with the spirit of an engineer.</v>

<v Speaker 1>We take it apart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>twist it,</v>

123
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:29.840
<v Speaker 1>turn it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bend it,</v>

124
00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:32.600
<v Speaker 1>and put it back together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or at least we try to.</v>

125
00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:35.630
<v Speaker 1>A great movie will never give up all at </v>
<v Speaker 1>secrets,</v>

126
00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:36.830
