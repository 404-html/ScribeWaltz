1
00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:06.800
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Thursday marks three years since the</v>

2
00:00:06.801 --> 00:00:11.801
<v Speaker 1>final episode of breaking bad air on TV </v>
<v Speaker 1>while it was on breaking bad grip,</v>

3
00:00:12.111 --> 00:00:12.944
<v Speaker 1>the culture of more tightly than almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>any other show and its legacy is still </v>

4
00:00:16.851 --> 00:00:19.880
<v Speaker 1>intact today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think because the arc of episodes that</v>

5
00:00:19.881 --> 00:00:20.714
<v Speaker 1>concluded the story brought a satisfying</v>
<v Speaker 1>and brutal reckoning on what came </v>

6
00:00:25.341 --> 00:00:26.174
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the best episode of the series </v>

7
00:00:28.341 --> 00:00:29.174
<v Speaker 1>can be found in that arch and today I </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to talk about that episode as </v>

8
00:00:31.641 --> 00:00:36.641
<v Speaker 1>humanity is the poem it references and </v>
<v Speaker 1>how the ideas in both help us understand</v>

9
00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.500
<v Speaker 1>the show as a whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a lot of ways.</v>

10
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.520
<v Speaker 1>This episode though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>third from the last book ends the entire</v>

11
00:00:43.521 --> 00:00:48.521
<v Speaker 1>series right or more wily Beckett makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>this explicit by staging the pre opening</v>

12
00:00:48.651 --> 00:00:49.484
<v Speaker 1>credits scene as a flashback to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first episode when Walter White and </v>

13
00:00:52.551 --> 00:00:56.390
<v Speaker 1>Jesse Pinkman are making their very </v>
<v Speaker 1>first batch of crystal Meth,</v>

14
00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:57.680
<v Speaker 1>the reaction has begun.</v>

15
00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.873
<v Speaker 1>The narrative of the show is its own </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of chemical reaction brought about </v>

16
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:03.673
<v Speaker 1>by choices like walters choice to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>crystal meth to raise money for his </v>

17
00:01:06.681 --> 00:01:08.690
<v Speaker 1>cancer treatment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the first lie,</v>

18
00:01:08.691 --> 00:01:11.210
<v Speaker 1>he's rehearsing to tell his wife about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

19
00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:12.373
<v Speaker 1>that lead to the horrifying consequences</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're about to witness director Ryan </v>

20
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.120
<v Speaker 1>Johnson makes these things explicit in </v>
<v Speaker 1>another way.</v>

21
00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:21.650
<v Speaker 1>We're more wildly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beckett,</v>

22
00:01:21.651 --> 00:01:25.670
<v Speaker 1>has plot and dialogue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Johnson has visuals,</v>

23
00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:26.563
<v Speaker 1>visuals like the slow fading of past </v>
<v Speaker 1>elements that show the passage of time </v>

24
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.090
<v Speaker 1>and the disappearance of the people and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the things that once were.</v>

25
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.133
<v Speaker 1>What we see in this episode is </v>
<v Speaker 1>effectively the bloody end of </v>

26
00:01:38.631 --> 00:01:42.350
<v Speaker 1>Heisenberg's rain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what's interesting is how not bloody</v>

27
00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:47.240
<v Speaker 1>it is while he beckett in Johnson placed</v>
<v Speaker 1>the focus instead on reactions,</v>

28
00:01:47.241 --> 00:01:51.140
<v Speaker 1>reaction shots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so we get an episode of Gazans.</v>

29
00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.860
<v Speaker 1>Quizzical gates is angry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gazes blankies is penetrating gazes.</v>

30
00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.130
<v Speaker 1>What's important isn't that wall gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>away with holly,</v>

31
00:01:58.131 --> 00:02:00.500
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that skylar sees it.</v>

32
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:01.543
<v Speaker 1>The death of Hank is showed for all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>two seconds before Ryan Johnson quickly </v>

33
00:02:04.671 --> 00:02:07.460
<v Speaker 1>cuts away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Compare this to the 44 seconds.</v>

34
00:02:07.461 --> 00:02:11.930
<v Speaker 1>He lingers on Walt Skyler's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Flynn's emory's reaction to that news.</v>

35
00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.850
<v Speaker 1>So in this episode we see Walter White </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the eyes of everyone else,</v>

36
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.300
<v Speaker 1>including virtually all of the key </v>
<v Speaker 1>players in the show.</v>

37
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.110
<v Speaker 1>And as is often the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people see more about walt,</v>

38
00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.800
<v Speaker 1>then he can about himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the smartest guy I ever met.</v>

39
00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.480
<v Speaker 1>He made up his mind 10 minutes ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these reactions,</v>

40
00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.200
<v Speaker 1>these gates makes waltz,</v>
<v Speaker 1>own tragedy even more stark.</v>

41
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.640
<v Speaker 1>It's his inability to see himself </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the eyes of those around him.</v>

42
00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:46.503
<v Speaker 1>Other people's gazes are like a mirror </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we use to see ourselves as Johnson </v>

43
00:02:50.801 --> 00:02:55.360
<v Speaker 1>highlights twice in this episode.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Waltz not ready to look into mirrors yet</v>

44
00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.310
<v Speaker 1>when he arrives home later in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>episode,</v>

45
00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.353
<v Speaker 1>he uses all his regular to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>negotiated everything is going to be </v>

46
00:03:02.351 --> 00:03:05.290
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both of you to trust me.</v>

47
00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:06.223
<v Speaker 1>You have to go right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But his words fall flat on skylar and </v>

48
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:12.693
<v Speaker 1>they sound absurd to us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While he beckett uses these words </v>

49
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.133
<v Speaker 1>brilliantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think as an extension of Walt's </v>

50
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:19.743
<v Speaker 1>blindness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is the climactic scene of </v>

51
00:03:21.581 --> 00:03:22.414
<v Speaker 1>the episode and the climactic moment in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the scene is not the fight between </v>

52
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.033
<v Speaker 1>Walton skylar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but our reaction bracketed by two </v>

53
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.860
<v Speaker 1>versions of the same line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but first time walt screams it.</v>

54
00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.020
<v Speaker 1>But when he finally glimpses himself </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the eyes of his family,</v>

55
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:39.243
<v Speaker 1>those same words deflate entirely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is where we can find some insight </v>

56
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:45.333
<v Speaker 1>in the episode title Ozymandias,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which references a sonnet by Percy </v>

57
00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.220
<v Speaker 1>shelley from 18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>18.</v>

58
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:52.803
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the poem that Bryan Cranston reads </v>

59
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.233
<v Speaker 1>in a promotional video for the season </v>
<v Speaker 1>showing that Vince Gilligan and the </v>

60
00:03:57.401 --> 00:03:59.770
<v Speaker 1>writers wanted to highlight this </v>
<v Speaker 1>connection.</v>

61
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.480
<v Speaker 1>The poem tells the story of Shelly's </v>
<v Speaker 1>meeting with a traveler who describes in</v>

62
00:04:04.481 --> 00:04:09.481
<v Speaker 1>detail a ruined sculpture of Ozymandias,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Greek name for Ramses,</v>

63
00:04:09.521 --> 00:04:10.354
<v Speaker 1>the second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most powerful Pharaoh of the </v>

64
00:04:11.681 --> 00:04:12.514
<v Speaker 1>Egyptian empire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the empty landscape where his great </v>

65
00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:16.023
<v Speaker 1>empire used to stand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of the parallels here are obvious </v>

66
00:04:19.121 --> 00:04:19.954
<v Speaker 1>like this shot where Walter white falls </v>
<v Speaker 1>rigidly to the ground like a statue </v>

67
00:04:23.381 --> 00:04:26.680
<v Speaker 1>crumbling like walters frown and </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrinkled lip,</v>

68
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.190
<v Speaker 1>like the lone level sands stretch far </v>
<v Speaker 1>away,</v>

69
00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:31.083
<v Speaker 1>Ryan Johnson even stages some visual </v>
<v Speaker 1>flourishes like having the broken glass </v>

70
00:04:33.791 --> 00:04:35.860
<v Speaker 1>of the car window look a lot like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Walton,</v>

71
00:04:35.861 --> 00:04:39.520
<v Speaker 1>Jesse's blue meth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>visualizing their empire fading into the</v>

72
00:04:39.521 --> 00:04:40.354
<v Speaker 1>desert like the poem breaking bad is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>comment on the transients of power and </v>

73
00:04:44.651 --> 00:04:45.484
<v Speaker 1>the arrogance of those who acquire it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the poem is also about seeing </v>

74
00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.490
<v Speaker 1>through the eyes of others.</v>

75
00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:52.653
<v Speaker 1>After all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we only see Ozymandias through the eyes </v>

76
00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:59.050
<v Speaker 1>of the sculptor and the sculptors work </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the eyes of the traveler and the</v>

77
00:04:59.051 --> 00:05:02.140
<v Speaker 1>traveler is common through the words of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the poet.</v>

78
00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:03.423
<v Speaker 1>I think this is so applicable to </v>
<v Speaker 1>breaking bad and to this episode </v>

79
00:05:05.981 --> 00:05:09.280
<v Speaker 1>particularly because what makes drama </v>
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>

80
00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.390
<v Speaker 1>what makes it interesting isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>climactic action scenes or the bombastic</v>

81
00:05:13.391 --> 00:05:17.080
<v Speaker 1>declaration of colorful characters or </v>
<v Speaker 1>even big ideas.</v>

82
00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:22.440
<v Speaker 1>It's the succession of reactions that </v>
<v Speaker 1>cascade off of every choice,</v>

83
00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:23.703
<v Speaker 1>that chemical and emotional reactions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people living together on earth these </v>

84
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:31.710
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is an incredible pressure for show</v>

85
00:05:31.711 --> 00:05:32.544
<v Speaker 1>runners have a show like this to have an</v>
<v Speaker 1>end in mind to stick the landing with </v>

86
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:40.210
<v Speaker 1>big payoffs and developments that will </v>
<v Speaker 1>shock all of us.</v>

87
00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:41.213
<v Speaker 1>Well Ozymandias has those things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I give the writers and director </v>

88
00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:46.023
<v Speaker 1>major credit for sticking to what </v>
<v Speaker 1>matters in an incredibly important </v>

89
00:05:49.871 --> 00:05:50.704
<v Speaker 1>episode for letting us see Walter White,</v>
<v Speaker 1>king of kings undoing through the many </v>

90
00:05:54.731 --> 00:05:56.890
<v Speaker 1>eyes of those who loved him.</v>

91
00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:05.270
<v Speaker 1>There is a brand new nerd writer video </v>
