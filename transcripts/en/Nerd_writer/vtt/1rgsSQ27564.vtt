1
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:10.853
<v Speaker 1>So I'm notoriously disorganized when it </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes to money and paying bills and </v>

2
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.210
<v Speaker 1>personal finance in general.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no good reason for it.</v>

3
00:00:18.211 --> 00:00:20.790
<v Speaker 1>Only to say that if left to my own </v>
<v Speaker 1>devices,</v>

4
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:21.743
<v Speaker 1>I'd only ever read things and learn </v>
<v Speaker 1>things and write things and make videos </v>

5
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.570
<v Speaker 1>like this in respect to my greater </v>
<v Speaker 1>happiness.</v>

6
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:28.823
<v Speaker 1>The only value money has is to give me </v>
<v Speaker 1>the freedom to do the things I like in </v>

7
00:00:32.401 --> 00:00:35.820
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Money to me is worthless.</v>

8
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:36.713
<v Speaker 1>And maybe that's the reason why I </v>
<v Speaker 1>neglect it so much because it's time </v>

9
00:00:40.561 --> 00:00:43.440
<v Speaker 1>consuming and tedious and boring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And clerical.</v>

10
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to take a look.</v>

11
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:46.470
<v Speaker 1>Take a look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me show you this right here.</v>

12
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.170
<v Speaker 1>Perfect Metaphor for what I'm talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

13
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:50.670
<v Speaker 1>So here's a book of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

14
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.073
<v Speaker 1>the philosophy of nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've just been catching up on a little </v>

15
00:00:53.521 --> 00:00:54.780
<v Speaker 1>bit of nature as you do.</v>

16
00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.140
<v Speaker 1>And as a bookmark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is absolutely real.</v>

17
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.920
<v Speaker 1>We have some macy's builts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Geico bill.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Here's a special one we got here.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Check this out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

22
00:01:19.441 --> 00:01:24.441
<v Speaker 1>is that a system or what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So today I've resolved to build a system</v>

23
00:01:24.841 --> 00:01:27.180
<v Speaker 1>for myself to become more organized in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this regard,</v>

24
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.480
<v Speaker 1>and there's only one place to go when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a problem,</v>

25
