00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.470
<v Speaker 1>Hello little peanuts and porcupines </v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee on a Tuesday and Vlog 55.</v>

2
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:15.920
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.350
<v Speaker 1>I love superheroes and I love good </v>
<v Speaker 1>movies.</v>

4
00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:21.830
<v Speaker 1>Put those two things together and I go </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking bananas.</v>

5
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.750
<v Speaker 1>One of my favorite superhero movies is </v>
<v Speaker 1>of course Sam Raimi,</v>

6
00:00:24.751 --> 00:00:25.584
<v Speaker 1>amy's original spider man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only because it's brilliant </v>

7
00:00:27.591 --> 00:00:28.424
<v Speaker 1>storytelling and it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because that movie really conveys </v>

8
00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.340
<v Speaker 1>the grace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the almost balletic movement of our hero</v>

9
00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:35.353
<v Speaker 1>through the New York City skyline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What gives spiderman his agility is a </v>

10
00:00:37.521 --> 00:00:41.600
<v Speaker 1>combination of heightened reflexes and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>pre-cognitive spider sense.</v>

11
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:42.443
<v Speaker 1>After that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super strengthened some handy webs and </v>

12
00:00:44.451 --> 00:00:46.700
<v Speaker 1>you have the best time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This side of Superman.</v>

13
00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:47.563
<v Speaker 1>Indeed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've spent countless hours walking </v>

14
00:00:48.351 --> 00:00:51.410
<v Speaker 1>through city staring wistfully up at </v>
<v Speaker 1>buildings as the other me.</v>

15
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.393
<v Speaker 1>The Spiderman may swings here and there </v>
<v Speaker 1>and deep parabolic arcs twisting into </v>

16
00:00:55.791 --> 00:00:56.960
<v Speaker 1>triple flips,</v>
<v Speaker 1>landing.</v>

17
00:00:56.961 --> 00:00:59.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't know on the poll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some American flag atop the empire state</v>

18
00:00:59.901 --> 00:01:00.734
<v Speaker 1>building.</v>

19
00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.960
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lost myself there a little bit though.</v>

20
00:01:05.961 --> 00:01:06.794
<v Speaker 1>I've been known to loiter around the </v>
<v Speaker 1>spider exhibit at the Natural History </v>

21
00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:09.763
<v Speaker 1>Museum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a real human tragedy that we don't </v>

22
00:01:10.731 --> 00:01:11.960
<v Speaker 1>get to have super powers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

23
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.913
<v Speaker 1>the best we can do is free running and </v>
<v Speaker 1>by we I of course mean other people and </v>

24
00:01:16.581 --> 00:01:17.414
<v Speaker 1>yet there are times when walking through</v>
<v Speaker 1>the densely populated spaces of </v>

25
00:01:20.031 --> 00:01:20.864
<v Speaker 1>Manhattan that I've marveled at my </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to move through a crowd and not </v>

26
00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:25.093
<v Speaker 1>crash into every other person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I can actually feel myself </v>

27
00:01:28.701 --> 00:01:29.534
<v Speaker 1>perceiving the speed and crisscrossing </v>
<v Speaker 1>directionality of all the people in </v>

28
00:01:32.901 --> 00:01:35.240
<v Speaker 1>front of me and when I get to the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>side,</v>

29
00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.510
<v Speaker 1>I feel like a regular Han Solo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>

30
00:01:38.511 --> 00:01:41.300
<v Speaker 1>Why aren't we a mess in airports or on </v>
<v Speaker 1>street corners?</v>

31
00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.080
<v Speaker 1>How are we all avoiding one another when</v>
<v Speaker 1>we look out onto a moving crowd,</v>

32
00:01:45.081 --> 00:01:45.914
<v Speaker 1>but we're actually seeing beyond busy </v>
<v Speaker 1>people talking on their cell phones is </v>

33
00:01:48.681 --> 00:01:49.514
<v Speaker 1>subtle increases and decreases in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>intensity of light reflecting off </v>

34
00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.980
<v Speaker 1>objects when light intensity increases </v>
<v Speaker 1>and object is moving towards you.</v>

35
00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.660
<v Speaker 1>Usually when it decreases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's moving farther away,</v>

36
00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.970
<v Speaker 1>but the retina is also sensing </v>
<v Speaker 1>directionality.</v>

37
00:02:01.971 --> 00:02:06.230
<v Speaker 1>Neurons fire and in code as they sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>edges moving over backgrounds in time,</v>

38
00:02:06.231 --> 00:02:07.064
<v Speaker 1>and we have separate groups of neurons </v>
<v Speaker 1>dedicated to perceiving things moving </v>

39
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.260
<v Speaker 1>left or right or clockwise or </v>
<v Speaker 1>counterclockwise.</v>

40
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.880
<v Speaker 1>Perceive your own sense of </v>
<v Speaker 1>directionality and action.</v>

41
00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.450
<v Speaker 1>Fix Your eyes on the center of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>animation.</v>

42
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.300
<v Speaker 1>What I'm about to show you is what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>called the waterfall,</v>

43
00:02:20.301 --> 00:02:24.410
<v Speaker 1>illusion or motion after effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stare at a waterfall for long enough and</v>

44
00:02:24.411 --> 00:02:27.110
<v Speaker 1>the neuron group coding it's downward </v>
<v Speaker 1>motion,</v>

45
00:02:27.111 --> 00:02:28.730
<v Speaker 1>will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for lack of a better term,</v>

46
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.820
<v Speaker 1>get bored and adapt to make that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>norm.</v>

47
00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:32.683
<v Speaker 1>Turn your head away to say a stationary </v>
<v Speaker 1>rock and the rock will seem to move </v>

48
00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.600
<v Speaker 1>upward in the opposite direction of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>false.</v>

49
00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:39.583
<v Speaker 1>That's because the stationary thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>relative to the adapted normal is </v>

50
00:02:43.011 --> 00:02:46.490
<v Speaker 1>actually up or instead of circles moving</v>
<v Speaker 1>inward,</v>

51
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.510
<v Speaker 1>this pattern may look like it's moving </v>
<v Speaker 1>outward.</v>

52
00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:51.950
<v Speaker 1>Add to this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our eyes on average,</v>

53
00:02:51.951 --> 00:02:56.420
<v Speaker 1>separated by six centimeters are </v>
<v Speaker 1>remarkably accurate at triangulating and</v>

54
00:02:56.421 --> 00:02:58.730
<v Speaker 1>object as long as it's within 100 </v>
<v Speaker 1>meters.</v>

55
00:02:58.731 --> 00:02:59.564
<v Speaker 1>If it's beyond 100 meters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to rely on other tricks like </v>

56
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.320
<v Speaker 1>perspective or motion parallax taking </v>
<v Speaker 1>all this information,</v>

57
00:03:05.321 --> 00:03:08.920
<v Speaker 1>the brain can calculate the velocity of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a variety of moving things at once.</v>

58
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.480
<v Speaker 1>The Retina,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we should never forget,</v>

59
00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:15.070
<v Speaker 1>is the only visible part of the brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>carries information via the optic nerve.</v>

60
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.933
<v Speaker 1>To the lateral geniculate nucleus and </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the visual cortex in the occipital </v>

61
00:03:19.421 --> 00:03:20.800
<v Speaker 1>lobe of the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From here,</v>

62
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.060
<v Speaker 1>the data splinters down two paths.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The two stream hypothesis made famous by</v>

63
00:03:25.061 --> 00:03:27.580
<v Speaker 1>David Milner and Melvin goodale in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>early nineties,</v>

64
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:28.503
<v Speaker 1>holds that some information goes down </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ventral stream to the temporal lobe </v>

65
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:32.403
<v Speaker 1>for object identification and </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognition so that we can figure out </v>

66
00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:36.610
<v Speaker 1>what it is that we're looking at.</v>

67
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:37.473
<v Speaker 1>The rest goes down the dorsal stream to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the parietal lobe where we process the </v>

68
00:03:40.781 --> 00:03:43.300
<v Speaker 1>objects spacial location relative to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>viewer.</v>

69
00:03:43.301 --> 00:03:44.830
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's two streams,</v>

70
00:03:44.831 --> 00:03:45.664
<v Speaker 1>one for what and one for where what was </v>
<v Speaker 1>merely color edge and brightness in the </v>

71
00:03:49.901 --> 00:03:53.290
<v Speaker 1>occipital lobe is a map spatial </v>
<v Speaker 1>awareness.</v>

72
00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.130
<v Speaker 1>By the time it reaches the parietal now </v>
<v Speaker 1>our knowledge of how we process movement</v>

73
00:03:57.131 --> 00:04:00.670
<v Speaker 1>is only as good as our working knowledge</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the brain of grass,</v>

74
00:04:00.671 --> 00:04:01.504
<v Speaker 1>which is to say the least incomplete,</v>
<v Speaker 1>better and find our technologies will </v>

75
00:04:04.421 --> 00:04:07.390
<v Speaker 1>give way to a better and finer </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding of the brain.</v>

76
00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:08.253
<v Speaker 1>But really understanding the brain is </v>
<v Speaker 1>only a function of our desire to </v>

77
00:04:11.801 --> 00:04:14.650
<v Speaker 1>understand in order to treat certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>kinds of brain damage.</v>

78
00:04:14.651 --> 00:04:17.350
<v Speaker 1>What's incredible is that when </v>
<v Speaker 1>functioning normally,</v>

79
00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:18.243
<v Speaker 1>we don't have to think about each and </v>
<v Speaker 1>every complicated step from perception </v>

80
00:04:21.641 --> 00:04:25.270
<v Speaker 1>to cognition to actually we can like </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain heroic walk crawlers,</v>

81
00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:26.283
<v Speaker 1>navigate our environment with a natural </v>
<v Speaker 1>grace in a kind of balletic dance with </v>

82
00:04:29.681 --> 00:04:32.800
<v Speaker 1>the fast and chaotic movement of </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything else.</v>

83
00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:35.173
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

84
00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:37.600
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

85
00:04:37.601 --> 00:04:42.601
<v Speaker 1>That was spider sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever life holds in store for me,</v>

86
00:04:47.431 --> 00:04:52.431
<v Speaker 1>I will never forget these words with </v>
<v Speaker 1>great power comes great responsibility.</v>

87
00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.760
<v Speaker 1>This is my gift,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my curse.</v>

88
00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.180
<v Speaker 1>Who am I?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Spiderman.</v>

89
00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:05.623
<v Speaker 2>Uh.</v>
