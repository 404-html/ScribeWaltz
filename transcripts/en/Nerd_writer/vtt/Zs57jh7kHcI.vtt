00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.140
<v Speaker 1>Wedged into the middle of the great </v>
<v Speaker 1>novel,</v>

2
00:00:04.141 --> 00:00:04.974
<v Speaker 1>the hunchback of Notre Dame,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Victor Hugo pauses the narrative to </v>

3
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.150
<v Speaker 1>philosophize on the ancient significance</v>
<v Speaker 1>of architecture.</v>

4
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:13.013
<v Speaker 1>From the beginning of time he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cultures of the Earth wrote their </v>

5
00:00:16.201 --> 00:00:17.034
<v Speaker 1>thoughts with rock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They made words by superimposing stone </v>

6
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.533
<v Speaker 1>upon stone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Celtic Doma and chrome lack that </v>

7
00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.990
<v Speaker 1>trust can tubulus the Hebrew Gal Gal our</v>
<v Speaker 1>words,</v>

8
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:28.853
<v Speaker 1>sometimes on a vast beach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They join these stone words and wrote a </v>

9
00:00:31.741 --> 00:00:32.574
<v Speaker 1>sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The traditions had given birth </v>

10
00:00:33.721 --> 00:00:34.554
<v Speaker 1>dissembles under which they disappeared </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the trunk of a tree under its </v>

11
00:00:38.311 --> 00:00:39.144
<v Speaker 1>foliage and the rock symbols had need to</v>
<v Speaker 1>expand into a structure in this way he </v>

12
00:00:43.801 --> 00:00:44.634
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>architecture developed concomitantly </v>

13
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.363
<v Speaker 1>with human thought reflected by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>great styles of the era and by the </v>

14
00:00:50.791 --> 00:00:51.624
<v Speaker 1>political and social revolutions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hindu architecture gateway to </v>

15
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:55.763
<v Speaker 1>Phoenician,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Egyptian to Greek and Roman Esk to </v>

16
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.050
<v Speaker 1>gothic locked into the walls of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>temples,</v>

17
00:01:01.051 --> 00:01:05.460
<v Speaker 1>palaces and churches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A civilization could launch what it knew</v>

18
00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:06.323
<v Speaker 1>into the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>confident that only the greatest </v>

19
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.730
<v Speaker 1>upheavals and natural disasters might </v>
<v Speaker 1>dislodge it from the earth,</v>

20
00:01:11.731 --> 00:01:15.900
<v Speaker 1>but as Notre Dame makes clear the gothic</v>
<v Speaker 1>period was the final page.</v>

21
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:16.733
<v Speaker 1>In this important epoch of architecture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the advent of the printing press by </v>

22
00:01:20.581 --> 00:01:24.450
<v Speaker 1>Johannes Gutenberg changed everything in</v>
<v Speaker 1>printed books,</v>

23
00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:29.451
<v Speaker 1>ideas found an even more durable capsule</v>
<v Speaker 1>for transmission into posterity,</v>

24
00:01:29.521 --> 00:01:33.840
<v Speaker 1>one that cost it far less to produce and</v>
<v Speaker 1>one that could be copied and sent across</v>

25
00:01:33.841 --> 00:01:34.674
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rise of the printing press mirrors </v>

26
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.883
<v Speaker 1>the decline of architecture as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominant aesthetic for on Tumbler last </v>

27
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:42.803
<v Speaker 1>week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is what got me thinking about </v>

28
00:01:43.501 --> 00:01:44.334
<v Speaker 1>this topic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Cajun Cavalier asked me what role I </v>

29
00:01:46.771 --> 00:01:47.604
<v Speaker 1>thought architecture plays in society </v>
<v Speaker 1>besides that of being a defense against </v>

30
00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:52.493
<v Speaker 1>the elements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it seems to me that these days </v>

31
00:01:54.001 --> 00:01:57.600
<v Speaker 1>architecture is govern like most arts by</v>
<v Speaker 1>pluralism.</v>

32
00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:58.643
<v Speaker 1>There is no consensus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nor perhaps neither be as to a </v>

33
00:02:01.771 --> 00:02:02.604
<v Speaker 1>representative style of the age arrows </v>
<v Speaker 1>that came after the sunset of the </v>

34
00:02:06.151 --> 00:02:06.984
<v Speaker 1>renaissance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're very reactionary to the revivals </v>

35
00:02:09.241 --> 00:02:10.074
<v Speaker 1>of the past and sought to create a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>aesthetic following from first the </v>

36
00:02:13.231 --> 00:02:14.064
<v Speaker 1>functionalist objectivity of modernism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the psychological subjectivity </v>

37
00:02:18.481 --> 00:02:19.314
<v Speaker 1>of postmodernist after just major urban </v>
<v Speaker 1>expansion that greatly emphasized the </v>

38
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.210
<v Speaker 1>function of structures over aesthetic or</v>
<v Speaker 1>function as aesthetic.</v>

39
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.650
<v Speaker 1>Contemporary architectural concerns seem</v>
<v Speaker 1>largely to deal with our societies next,</v>

40
00:02:31.651 --> 00:02:32.484
<v Speaker 1>great challenge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sustainability or integration with the </v>

41
00:02:35.101 --> 00:02:35.934
<v Speaker 1>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a concern that has to be met </v>

42
00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.810
<v Speaker 1>with action,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it seems to me,</v>

43
00:02:39.811 --> 00:02:40.644
<v Speaker 1>and I may be wrong about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there is a gross under emphasis of </v>

44
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.470
<v Speaker 1>the power that architecture plays on our</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness and culture,</v>

45
00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:50.363
<v Speaker 1>the demarcation of physical spaces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the spatial arrangement of inside and </v>

46
00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:55.770
<v Speaker 1>outside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's communal,</v>

47
00:02:55.771 --> 00:02:56.604
<v Speaker 1>what's private in an urban environment </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a massive effect on the way we see </v>

48
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.310
<v Speaker 1>ourselves and our place in the society </v>
<v Speaker 1>at large.</v>

49
00:03:03.311 --> 00:03:06.580
<v Speaker 1>What does it mean to live in a cramped </v>
<v Speaker 1>studio apartment in Manhattan?</v>

50
00:03:06.581 --> 00:03:07.414
<v Speaker 1>What does it mean to live in suburbia </v>
<v Speaker 1>among cookie cutter homes with perfect </v>

51
00:03:10.151 --> 00:03:13.450
<v Speaker 1>lawns?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The utilitarian function of architecture</v>

52
00:03:13.451 --> 00:03:14.284
<v Speaker 1>is so obvious that it almost disappears </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the background or rather it </v>

53
00:03:17.861 --> 00:03:20.780
<v Speaker 1>disappears as the background and when we</v>
<v Speaker 1>let it do so,</v>

54
00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.500
<v Speaker 1>when architecture becomes invisible to </v>
<v Speaker 1>us,</v>

55
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.060
<v Speaker 1>it's influenced for good or bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes invisible as well.</v>

56
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.720
<v Speaker 1>In the inner city where I lived,</v>
<v Speaker 1>demand is so high for livable spaces.</v>

57
00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.160
<v Speaker 1>New structures are built with such </v>
<v Speaker 1>rapidity that it's impossible to imagine</v>

58
00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.730
<v Speaker 1>any kind of central architectural theory</v>
<v Speaker 1>winning out.</v>

59
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.640
<v Speaker 1>That's pluralism at work tolerant but </v>
<v Speaker 1>messy,</v>

60
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.480
<v Speaker 1>inclusive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but alien.</v>

61
00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.830
<v Speaker 1>The period after postmodernism has gone </v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly undefined.</v>

62
00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:48.693
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if a school of architecture</v>
<v Speaker 1>will ever again rise to cultural </v>

63
00:03:51.881 --> 00:03:52.714
<v Speaker 1>predominance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like I don't know if we'll ever </v>

64
00:03:53.861 --> 00:03:54.694
<v Speaker 1>have a classic literature with the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>weight as Shakespeare or f Scott </v>

65
00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:59.553
<v Speaker 1>Fitzgerald,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if there ever was a time Cajun </v>

66
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.380
<v Speaker 1>cavalier for a new architecture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a new idea,</v>

67
00:04:05.381 --> 00:04:10.381
<v Speaker 1>a new choreography of space and humanity</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be in the void of now.</v>

68
00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.250
<v Speaker 1>Hey everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for watching.</v>

69
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.130
<v Speaker 1>As you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of time and research goes into the</v>

<v Speaker 1>making of these videos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I want to thank the good </v>

80
00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.530
<v Speaker 1>That's a great opportunity to learn more</v>
<v Speaker 1>about architecture,</v>

81
00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:50.633
<v Speaker 1>but in this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to recommend the hunchback of </v>

82
00:04:52.411 --> 00:04:54.740
<v Speaker 1>Notre Dame by Victor Hugo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

83
00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.110
<v Speaker 1>it is an amazing book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a classic and it's by the way,</v>

84
00:04:58.111 --> 00:05:01.170
<v Speaker 1>some way darker and better than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Disney version.</v>

85
00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.153
<v Speaker 1>And also I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to the site and check it's read </v>

86
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.350
<v Speaker 1>by George Dahl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is one of the masters of audio books</v>

87
00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.990
<v Speaker 1>and I might just listen to it again just</v>
<v Speaker 1>to hear him do it.</v>

88
00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.660
<v Speaker 1>They have a free app so you can download</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and put it on your phone,</v>

89
00:05:12.661 --> 00:05:13.494
<v Speaker 1>which is what I usually do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen to it on the subway or I'll </v>

90
00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.790
<v Speaker 1>listen to it like in my bed before I go </v>
<v Speaker 1>to sleep.</v>

91
00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.650
<v Speaker 1>For some reason that soothing to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so go to audible.com/Evan.</v>

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:23.513
<v Speaker 1>Get the hunchback of Notre Dame on me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do want to mention that the idea for </v>

93
00:05:27.061 --> 00:05:30.120
<v Speaker 1>this video came from the occasion </v>
<v Speaker 1>cavalier on Tumbler.</v>

94
00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.083
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>last week I did a video on video games </v>

95
00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.300
<v Speaker 1>and all week long we were having </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversations about it,</v>

96
00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.250
<v Speaker 1>me and all the people who watch this </v>
<v Speaker 1>video.</v>

97
00:05:38.251 --> 00:05:39.084
<v Speaker 1>So I want to thank all of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've been commenting in the video </v>

98
00:05:40.801 --> 00:05:41.634
<v Speaker 1>below.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've been asking me anything on </v>

99
00:05:42.751 --> 00:05:45.900
<v Speaker 1>tumbler where I can sort of expand on </v>
<v Speaker 1>things a little bit more.</v>

100
00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:46.883
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so keep doing that and I will see you </v>

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:48.923
<v Speaker 1>next Friday.</v>
