<v Speaker 1>You try to preserve a fleeting moments </v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.070
<v Speaker 1>depends what you call bleeding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes a geologic sense,</v>

3
00:00:12.071 --> 00:00:16.310
<v Speaker 1>the years of a pretty woman and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes with the people,</v>

4
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.170
<v Speaker 1>the 25th of a second</v>

5
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.003
<v Speaker 2>these days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're most likely to see the work of </v>

6
00:00:21.811 --> 00:00:22.644
<v Speaker 2>American photographer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ansell Adams on a postcard or on the </v>

7
00:00:26.791 --> 00:00:27.624
<v Speaker 2>wall of your boss's office.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His photographs are so ubiquitous now </v>

8
00:00:30.961 --> 00:00:31.794
<v Speaker 2>that it's easy to walk by them without </v>
<v Speaker 2>noticing their technical anesthetic </v>

9
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.540
<v Speaker 2>mastery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Indeed,</v>

10
00:00:36.541 --> 00:00:38.910
<v Speaker 2>thanks to things like instagram and </v>
<v Speaker 2>snapchat,</v>

11
00:00:38.911 --> 00:00:39.744
<v Speaker 2>photographs in general are so ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>present in our lives that standards </v>

12
00:00:43.141 --> 00:00:43.974
<v Speaker 2>about what we believe to be great work </v>
<v Speaker 2>in this field are drowned out by the </v>

13
00:00:47.551 --> 00:00:51.150
<v Speaker 2>literally billions of photos that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>uploaded to the services.</v>

14
00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:54.350
<v Speaker 2>Every day I come across something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>excites me.</v>

15
00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.380
<v Speaker 2>I see the picture in my mind is high and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I make the photograph and then I give it</v>

16
00:01:00.381 --> 00:01:03.810
<v Speaker 2>to you as the equivalent of help.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the beginning,</v>

17
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:04.673
<v Speaker 2>ansell Adams took photographs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not unlike all those millions of us on </v>

18
00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:11.040
<v Speaker 2>instagram as a visual diary of his </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience,</v>

19
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.173
<v Speaker 2>Adams took his first Brownie box camera </v>
<v Speaker 2>on trips to the Sierra Nevada mountains </v>

20
00:01:15.631 --> 00:01:18.270
<v Speaker 2>to place that wouldn't throw him for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>rest of his life.</v>

21
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.410
<v Speaker 2>His early photographs are enthusiastic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uninspired.</v>

22
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.393
<v Speaker 2>Adam had that feeling that I have every </v>
<v Speaker 2>single time I pick up a still camera of </v>

23
00:01:27.301 --> 00:01:30.930
<v Speaker 2>not getting in the print.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I see with my eyes.</v>

24
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:32.323
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is largely because of the dynamic </v>

25
00:01:33.361 --> 00:01:34.194
<v Speaker 2>range of the human eye.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The brightest and darkest thing it can </v>

26
00:01:36.511 --> 00:01:40.380
<v Speaker 2>see at the same time exceeds any film or</v>
<v Speaker 2>Digital Camera,</v>

27
00:01:40.381 --> 00:01:43.260
<v Speaker 2>especially those answers was using in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the early 20th century,</v>

28
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.500
<v Speaker 2>but this all changed friends on April </v>
<v Speaker 2>10th,</v>

29
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.940
<v Speaker 2>19,</v>
<v Speaker 2>27.</v>

30
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.430
<v Speaker 2>The footage you're watching right now is</v>
<v Speaker 2>from an excursion.</v>

31
00:01:50.431 --> 00:01:52.620
<v Speaker 2>Adams took with his future wife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Virginia,</v>

32
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.020
<v Speaker 2>to the half dome in Yosemite National </v>
<v Speaker 2>Park,</v>

33
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.920
<v Speaker 2>holding his corona view camera,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two lenses to filters,</v>

34
00:01:58.921 --> 00:02:02.010
<v Speaker 2>a heavy wouldn't tripod and 12 class </v>
<v Speaker 2>plates.</v>

35
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.143
<v Speaker 2>He made his way onto the so-called </v>
<v Speaker 2>diving board where you can look along </v>

36
00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:06.803
<v Speaker 2>the side of the massive granite dome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And here Adams had a vision of what he </v>

37
00:02:10.831 --> 00:02:15.831
<v Speaker 2>wanted his image to look like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He cites this as his first conscious use</v>

38
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:16.703
<v Speaker 2>of the technique called visualization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole key live specifically in </v>

39
00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.950
<v Speaker 2>seeing it to the mind's eye,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we call it visualization.</v>

40
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.650
<v Speaker 2>First,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Adam's tried his yellow filter.</v>

41
00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:29.753
<v Speaker 2>This is the image it produced similar </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably to what Adam saw looking </v>

42
00:02:32.611 --> 00:02:33.444
<v Speaker 2>through the camera's viewfinder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not what he visualized in his </v>

43
00:02:36.091 --> 00:02:38.460
<v Speaker 2>mind's eye.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was no excitement in the frame,</v>

44
00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.130
<v Speaker 2>so he took out his red filter for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>second shot.</v>

45
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.570
<v Speaker 2>He said the exposure at [inaudible] and </v>
<v Speaker 2>expose the plate for five seconds.</v>

46
00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.150
<v Speaker 2>When Adam's developed this photo and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>his internal visualization,</v>

47
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.910
<v Speaker 2>he knew that this was his life's </v>
<v Speaker 2>calling,</v>

48
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:05.283
<v Speaker 2>and look at the difference,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes the darkened sky charges the </v>

49
00:03:07.481 --> 00:03:10.450
<v Speaker 2>image with drama and intensity in </v>
<v Speaker 2>contrast,</v>

50
00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.870
<v Speaker 2>and Adams had an instinctive genius </v>
<v Speaker 2>about tonal balance.</v>

51
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:14.733
<v Speaker 2>In contrast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and to formalize this craft to ensure </v>

52
00:03:16.511 --> 00:03:18.670
<v Speaker 2>that he could achieve his </v>
<v Speaker 2>visualizations.</v>

53
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:19.803
<v Speaker 2>He developed another tool with his </v>
<v Speaker 2>friend Fred Archer called the zone </v>

54
00:03:23.021 --> 00:03:26.380
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The zone system splits the full range of</v>

55
00:03:26.381 --> 00:03:27.214
<v Speaker 2>black to white into 11 separate zones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>each one f stop or aperture setting </v>

56
00:03:31.781 --> 00:03:34.330
<v Speaker 2>apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The photographer spot meter is different</v>

57
00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.530
<v Speaker 2>elements in his frame and determines </v>
<v Speaker 2>where everything fits in the zones.</v>

58
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.690
<v Speaker 2>This way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the photographer has a sense of what his</v>

59
00:03:40.691 --> 00:03:41.524
<v Speaker 2>entire frame will look like before he </v>
<v Speaker 2>shoots knowing how everything will </v>

60
00:03:44.291 --> 00:03:48.550
<v Speaker 2>change with different exposures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To take a look at Adam's famous photo of</v>

61
00:03:48.551 --> 00:03:51.700
<v Speaker 2>the tetons and the snake river taken in </v>
<v Speaker 2>1942.</v>

62
00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.210
<v Speaker 2>The contrast here is really incredible </v>
<v Speaker 2>and to get a better sense of it.</v>

63
00:03:55.211 --> 00:03:56.044
<v Speaker 2>Let's pixelate the image.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look how Adams represents basically </v>

64
00:03:58.721 --> 00:04:02.260
<v Speaker 2>every zone in the system all the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>from zone zero,</v>

65
00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:03.123
<v Speaker 2>full black in the shadow of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mountains here to zone 10 in the light </v>

66
00:04:06.821 --> 00:04:07.654
<v Speaker 2>reflecting off the river.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's even more extraordinary is his </v>

67
00:04:09.881 --> 00:04:14.290
<v Speaker 2>ability to capture the highlight detail </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the clouds and elsewhere on the river</v>

68
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.830
<v Speaker 2>and the shadow details and the trees </v>
<v Speaker 2>that covered the bank.</v>

69
00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.440
<v Speaker 3>Perhaps music is the most expressive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>

70
00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.260
<v Speaker 3>as a photographer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe that a photography practice in</v>

71
00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.580
<v Speaker 3>terms of quality may also reveal endless</v>
<v Speaker 3>horizons,</v>

72
00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:38.593
<v Speaker 3>meaning</v>

73
00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.843
<v Speaker 2>ansell Adams work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his devotion to craft and more </v>

74
00:04:42.221 --> 00:04:45.640
<v Speaker 2>importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>intention in photography is an important</v>

75
00:04:45.641 --> 00:04:50.530
<v Speaker 2>example in our time when there are more </v>
<v Speaker 2>pictures posted in six months than there</v>

76
00:04:50.531 --> 00:04:55.480
<v Speaker 2>are stars in the Milky Way Galaxy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Having fought so hard for the acceptance</v>

77
00:04:55.481 --> 00:04:56.314
<v Speaker 2>of photography as an art,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Adams probably would've laughed at a </v>

78
00:04:59.321 --> 00:05:02.590
<v Speaker 2>statistic like that today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone has a camera,</v>

79
00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.890
<v Speaker 2>but how many visualize what they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to capture beforehand?</v>

80
00:05:05.891 --> 00:05:06.724
<v Speaker 2>How many measure the light or hike for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>day to reach the perfect spot so the </v>

81
00:05:11.321 --> 00:05:15.460
<v Speaker 2>next time you walk by one of Ansell </v>
<v Speaker 2>Adams photographs in the hallway of your</v>

82
00:05:15.461 --> 00:05:19.780
<v Speaker 2>doctor's office,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take a longer look and remember that our</v>

83
00:05:19.781 --> 00:05:23.770
<v Speaker 2>photographic world is the one he gave </v>
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>

84
00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.130
<v Speaker 4>Anything that excites me is that within </v>
<v Speaker 4>not too many years,</v>

85
00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:30.690
<v Speaker 4>we're going to have a title,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a new medium of expression that they hit</v>

86
00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:34.570
<v Speaker 4>me and I know the potentials are there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to be wonderful.</v>

87
00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:38.630
<v Speaker 2>Hey everybody.</v>

<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

90
00:05:44.811 --> 00:05:46.790

<v Speaker 2>experimenting with here,</v>

91
00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.073
<v Speaker 2>which is what I love to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just love to experiment with editing </v>

92
00:05:50.031 --> 00:05:52.730
<v Speaker 2>and try to give you something that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>hope you haven't seen before on Youtube.</v>
