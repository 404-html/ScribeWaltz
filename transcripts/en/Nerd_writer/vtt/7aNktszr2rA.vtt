00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.820
<v Speaker 1>Congrats to the Baltimore Ravens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys suck,</v>

2
00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:05.940
<v Speaker 1>but you want a coffee or a Tuesday and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Vlog 48.</v>

3
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.330
<v Speaker 1>So when I finished the sixth grade and </v>
<v Speaker 1>was ready to make the big move,</v>

4
00:00:20.331 --> 00:00:22.040
<v Speaker 1>did junior high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My parents said,</v>

5
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:22.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Evan,</v>

6
00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.810
<v Speaker 1>elementary school was easy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but next year junior high,</v>

7
00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.850
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to be so easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Next year is going to be hot,</v>

8
00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:30.703
<v Speaker 1>so I steeled my 11 year old self and </v>
<v Speaker 1>brace for junior high with a certain </v>

9
00:00:33.111 --> 00:00:35.930
<v Speaker 1>figure and expectation that life has so </v>
<v Speaker 1>far been a light breeze,</v>

10
00:00:35.931 --> 00:00:36.764
<v Speaker 1>but now that was over there was going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be a certain fundamental change and </v>

11
00:00:39.371 --> 00:00:41.450
<v Speaker 1>things in that change would be for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>worse.</v>

12
00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:42.650
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seventh grade came in,</v>

13
00:00:42.651 --> 00:00:45.650
<v Speaker 1>seventh grade went and when I opened my </v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes,</v>

14
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.320
<v Speaker 1>everything was still pretty simple and </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty easy.</v>

15
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.300
<v Speaker 1>Things really hadn't changed that </v>
<v Speaker 1>summer.</v>

16
00:00:50.301 --> 00:00:51.260
<v Speaker 1>My parents said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

17
00:00:51.261 --> 00:00:53.000
<v Speaker 1>Evan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seventh grade was easy,</v>

18
00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:54.520
<v Speaker 1>but eighth grade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>

19
00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.200
<v Speaker 1>things are going to get serious now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get ready.</v>

20
00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.820
<v Speaker 1>Eighth grade came and went that summer.</v>

21
00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:59.653
<v Speaker 1>My parents warned me about high school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but by that time I had come to believe </v>

22
00:01:02.331 --> 00:01:05.840
<v Speaker 1>that they were pretty unreliable sources</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this particular field.</v>

23
00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:06.703
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they kept saying so every year through </v>

24
00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.370
<v Speaker 1>high school and college and every year I</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't help but almost believed them,</v>

25
00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.780
<v Speaker 1>but every year they were wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

26
00:01:14.781 --> 00:01:15.614
<v Speaker 1>to be very clear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am not implying in any way that I'm </v>

27
00:01:17.991 --> 00:01:20.300
<v Speaker 1>gifted or smarter than the average </v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

28
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.180
<v Speaker 1>The whole point of the nerd writer is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I'm not,</v>

29
00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.060
<v Speaker 1>but I never did do much work in school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never did try very hard.</v>

30
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.210
<v Speaker 1>I found despite my parents' warnings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I didn't need to.</v>

31
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.103
<v Speaker 1>I often joke with friends that in school</v>
<v Speaker 1>I studied the teachers and not the </v>

32
00:01:33.561 --> 00:01:34.394
<v Speaker 1>subjects and it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I deconstructed the personalities of </v>

33
00:01:36.681 --> 00:01:39.530
<v Speaker 1>the great givers of how they were to </v>
<v Speaker 1>test and awarded points,</v>

34
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:40.573
<v Speaker 1>I could construct my own personality and</v>
<v Speaker 1>word my own answers in a way that was </v>

35
00:01:44.511 --> 00:01:46.540
<v Speaker 1>complimentary and that's how I got </v>
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>

36
00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.210
<v Speaker 1>I think I saw even at a young age that </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality was fluid.</v>

37
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.760
<v Speaker 1>It was in constant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which made it flexible.</v>

38
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.150
<v Speaker 1>A huge number of the rules of society </v>
<v Speaker 1>were convention.</v>

39
00:01:56.151 --> 00:01:56.984
<v Speaker 1>They were as alterable as people were </v>
<v Speaker 1>persuadable at the risk of self </v>

40
00:02:00.381 --> 00:02:03.110
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalysis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this comes in large part from my</v>

41
00:02:03.111 --> 00:02:07.280
<v Speaker 1>dad who is in a word in cordial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a born Hagler,</v>

42
00:02:07.281 --> 00:02:08.114
<v Speaker 1>unwilling to believe that something </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't be done until these strided </v>

43
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.590
<v Speaker 1>himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a great quality,</v>

44
00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:13.453
<v Speaker 1>but enough about me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this just all in my head or is there </v>

45
00:02:15.561 --> 00:02:17.230
<v Speaker 1>some truth to this id?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

46
00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.113
<v Speaker 1>in the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we're really talking about is </v>

47
00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.830
<v Speaker 1>evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about intuition,</v>

48
00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:22.723
<v Speaker 1>reason morality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about the way people were </v>

49
00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.420
<v Speaker 1>early in Plato's Republic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a dialogue about justice and the perfect</v>

50
00:02:29.421 --> 00:02:30.254
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The precocious young glaucon puts a </v>

51
00:02:32.001 --> 00:02:34.280
<v Speaker 1>question to socrates worded in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>popular,</v>

52
00:02:34.281 --> 00:02:35.960
<v Speaker 1>would you rather style it's this?</v>

53
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.823
<v Speaker 1>Would you rather be an honest and fair </v>
<v Speaker 1>person and have everyone believe that </v>

54
00:02:39.501 --> 00:02:40.334
<v Speaker 1>you're a liar and the Douche bag,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or would you rather be a liar and a </v>

55
00:02:43.731 --> 00:02:44.564
<v Speaker 1>douchebag and have everyone believed </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're a fair and honest and </v>

56
00:02:47.241 --> 00:02:49.850
<v Speaker 1>wonderful person?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's Plato's prerogative to prove to</v>

57
00:02:49.851 --> 00:02:53.150
<v Speaker 1>glaucon that being good is better than </v>
<v Speaker 1>seeming good.</v>

58
00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.013
<v Speaker 1>That our minds are perfect reasoning </v>
<v Speaker 1>machines meant to find truth and master </v>

59
00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.820
<v Speaker 1>the lowly passions despite the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reputational costs,</v>

60
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.863
<v Speaker 1>and that in truth is happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Glaucon like a good little bitch is </v>

61
00:03:04.511 --> 00:03:06.460
<v Speaker 1>eventually brought around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to be fair,</v>

62
00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.020
<v Speaker 1>socrates is a master debater and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's saying sounds good,</v>

63
00:03:11.021 --> 00:03:15.460
<v Speaker 1>but the reality of humanity is somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 1>different than Plato's idea of the truth</v>

64
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:20.050
<v Speaker 1>about us is that our minds are less </v>
<v Speaker 1>equipped for reasoning than they are for</v>

65
00:03:20.051 --> 00:03:20.884
<v Speaker 1>justification.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A number of studies by moral </v>

66
00:03:22.511 --> 00:03:23.344
<v Speaker 1>psychologist Robert Howard Margolis and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jonathan Haidt show us that intuitions </v>

67
00:03:27.851 --> 00:03:28.684
<v Speaker 1>and emotions rule that when in contact </v>
<v Speaker 1>with anything we react instantaneously </v>

68
00:03:33.431 --> 00:03:36.910
<v Speaker 1>for or against that thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and our reason goes to work,</v>

69
00:03:36.911 --> 00:03:37.744
<v Speaker 1>looking not for the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for a way to justify what we've </v>

70
00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:41.410
<v Speaker 1>already decided.</v>

71
00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.010
<v Speaker 1>Ever try telling someone they're wrong </v>
<v Speaker 1>about something flat out well.</v>

72
00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.903
<v Speaker 1>Your tone has already defeated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your purpose of that person senses </v>

73
00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:49.443
<v Speaker 1>confrontation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their whole being will turn away from </v>

74
00:03:51.371 --> 00:03:52.204
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the smart little politician in their </v>

75
00:03:53.411 --> 00:03:54.244
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason that Plato imagines is </v>

76
00:03:55.691 --> 00:03:58.150
<v Speaker 1>working to find the truth instead goes </v>
<v Speaker 1>to work.</v>

77
00:03:58.151 --> 00:03:58.984
<v Speaker 1>Finding the reasons why your wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've evolved to become outstandingly </v>

78
00:04:02.291 --> 00:04:03.124
<v Speaker 1>adept at justifying our intuitions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it explains a lot why we argue when </v>

79
00:04:06.611 --> 00:04:09.040
<v Speaker 1>we're wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why we forgive good looking people their</v>

80
00:04:09.041 --> 00:04:13.300
<v Speaker 1>flaws and vice versa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why we lie and omit and carefully carved</v>

81
00:04:13.301 --> 00:04:15.490
<v Speaker 1>the versions of ourselves that we show </v>
<v Speaker 1>to others.</v>

82
00:04:15.491 --> 00:04:16.324
<v Speaker 1>Simply the evolutionary advantages of </v>
<v Speaker 1>discovering the truth are less than the </v>

83
00:04:19.751 --> 00:04:23.410
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary advantages of having a good</v>
<v Speaker 1>reputation glaucon,</v>

84
00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.393
<v Speaker 1>who in the end would rather be a liar </v>
<v Speaker 1>that everyone likes has got us pinned </v>

85
00:04:27.671 --> 00:04:30.580
<v Speaker 1>more accurately than even the great </v>
<v Speaker 1>plato.</v>

86
00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.250
<v Speaker 1>To know these things gives one a great </v>
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>

87
00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.710
<v Speaker 1>You're likely to get more out of life if</v>
<v Speaker 1>like my dad,</v>

88
00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:36.753
<v Speaker 1>you haggle with reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>addressing someone's intuitions or </v>

89
00:04:39.461 --> 00:04:42.880
<v Speaker 1>emotions will more readily yield the </v>
<v Speaker 1>results that you want from them.</v>

90
00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.360
<v Speaker 1>People are fluid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reality is people.</v>

91
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.350
<v Speaker 1>Reality is fluid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is an insidious side to this and I</v>

92
00:04:50.351 --> 00:04:52.300
<v Speaker 1>think you could hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Essentially,</v>

93
00:04:52.301 --> 00:04:56.290
<v Speaker 1>we are made to be manipulated and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no shortage of that.</v>

94
00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:57.700
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in human history,</v>

95
00:04:57.701 --> 00:04:58.534
<v Speaker 1>probably in your personal history too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but along with our intuitive desire to </v>

96
00:05:01.841 --> 00:05:02.674
<v Speaker 1>get what we want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are also guided by the intuitive </v>

97
00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.860
<v Speaker 1>aversion to harm our reasoning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Faculty is not a slave to our emotions,</v>

98
00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:09.813
<v Speaker 1>but a politician and the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>politicians like the best people can </v>

99
00:05:12.731 --> 00:05:15.850
<v Speaker 1>navigate a fluid reality of flexible </v>
<v Speaker 1>rules seeking,</v>

100
00:05:15.851 --> 00:05:20.170
<v Speaker 1>ever subtler ways not to harm the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>they share the world with.</v>

101
00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.530
<v Speaker 1>And you know what harms people </v>
<v Speaker 1>manipulation.</v>

102
00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:34.600
<v Speaker 2>Hey everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thanks for watching.</v>

<v Speaker 2>psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I highly recommend the righteous mind by</v>

106
00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.740
<v Speaker 2>Jonathan Haidt is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a great book,</v>

107
00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:46.350
<v Speaker 2>extremely well written,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:49.240
<v Speaker 2>and you'll learn a little bit more about</v>
<v Speaker 2>why we think the way we think.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so read that and I will see you next </v>
