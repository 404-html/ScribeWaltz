1
00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:15.843
<v Speaker 1>One consequence of Hollywood being </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominated by superheroes and franchises </v>

2
00:00:18.911 --> 00:00:22.570
<v Speaker 1>is that by the time you're my age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've seen about 6,000</v>

3
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.210
<v Speaker 1>action,</v>
<v Speaker 1>second summer spectacular.</v>

4
00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:26.523
<v Speaker 1>Many are not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's pretty easy to distinguish </v>

5
00:00:31.001 --> 00:00:31.834
<v Speaker 1>between the two because the reaction is </v>
<v Speaker 1>physical as adrenaline being released </v>

6
00:00:34.751 --> 00:00:38.270
<v Speaker 1>into your system or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you gripping your armrest or not?</v>

7
00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:39.663
<v Speaker 1>After watching all these set pieces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we've sort of been forced to </v>

8
00:00:41.981 --> 00:00:44.440
<v Speaker 1>develop an intuitive sophistication </v>
<v Speaker 1>about them.</v>

9
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:45.573
<v Speaker 1>There are no shortcuts to thrilling and </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience that's absolutely drowning in </v>

10
00:00:48.881 --> 00:00:52.180
<v Speaker 1>this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We recognize and champion good work when</v>

11
00:00:52.181 --> 00:00:55.180
<v Speaker 1>we see and feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the secret to the success</v>

12
00:00:55.181 --> 00:00:58.180
<v Speaker 1>of franchises like mission impossible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fast and furious,</v>

13
00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:59.223
<v Speaker 1>and John Wick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are movies that are committed to </v>

14
00:01:01.151 --> 00:01:03.100
<v Speaker 1>weld,</v>
<v Speaker 1>choreographed well edited,</v>

15
00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.590
<v Speaker 1>real action,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

16
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:06.943
<v Speaker 1>Not always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Real cruise understands exactly what </v>

17
00:01:11.091 --> 00:01:13.820
<v Speaker 1>he's offering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The three or four genuinely creative set</v>

18
00:01:13.821 --> 00:01:14.654
<v Speaker 1>pieces with a serviceable plot that </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't take itself too seriously and a </v>

19
00:01:17.331 --> 00:01:18.164
<v Speaker 1>few charismatic actors can be a really </v>
<v Speaker 1>fun movie going experience well worth </v>

20
00:01:21.621 --> 00:01:22.360
<v Speaker 1>the price of.</v>

21
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.193
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

22
00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:26.263
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this formula I think in many ways </v>

23
00:01:28.041 --> 00:01:31.190
<v Speaker 1>defines the strategy of the marvel </v>
<v Speaker 1>cinematic universe.</v>

24
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.870
<v Speaker 1>Some of those movies are undoubtedly </v>
<v Speaker 1>better than this.</v>

25
00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:34.723
<v Speaker 1>Some unfortunately worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they've tried their best to hew to </v>

26
00:01:37.851 --> 00:01:40.130
<v Speaker 1>this baseline and I think it's worked </v>
<v Speaker 1>out pretty well for them.</v>

27
00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.890
<v Speaker 1>Anyone else?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every ingredient matters of course,</v>

28
00:01:42.891 --> 00:01:46.950
<v Speaker 1>but the marvel set pieces have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>really consistent by enlarge and they're</v>

29
00:01:46.951 --> 00:01:47.784
<v Speaker 1>probably the things that I remember most</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I think back on these movies now I </v>

30
00:01:51.501 --> 00:01:54.710
<v Speaker 1>know there's a certain amount of fatigue</v>
<v Speaker 1>these days about superhero films.</v>

31
00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.750
<v Speaker 1>I feel that way too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More and more,</v>

32
00:01:56.751 --> 00:01:57.584
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I ever think back to my expectations </v>

33
00:01:58.971 --> 00:02:02.300
<v Speaker 1>as a kid for what big screen superhero </v>
<v Speaker 1>team up fights would be like.</v>

34
00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.883
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's definitely exceeds the laws of </v>

35
00:02:07.521 --> 00:02:08.354
<v Speaker 1>physics at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot going on here that you </v>

36
00:02:09.741 --> 00:02:13.790
<v Speaker 1>don't understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The sad part about this is that as a kid</v>

37
00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.520
<v Speaker 1>I read DC comics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not marvel comics,</v>

38
00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:17.653
<v Speaker 1>and unfortunately the DC extended </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe set pieces leave a lot to be </v>

39
00:02:21.921 --> 00:02:22.754
<v Speaker 1>desired.</v>

40
00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.910
<v Speaker 1>There are a lot of reasons for this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that people have explored before</v>

41
00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:29.773
<v Speaker 1>Zack Snyder's preference for stylized </v>
<v Speaker 1>coloring versus the more muted </v>

42
00:02:32.991 --> 00:02:33.824
<v Speaker 1>cinematography of the mcu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The overuse of super slow motion and </v>

43
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.090
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous virtual camera moves like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

44
00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:44.143
<v Speaker 1>but there are a few other things I want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to point out that I think make a bigger </v>

45
00:02:46.461 --> 00:02:48.770
<v Speaker 1>difference when it comes to superhero </v>
<v Speaker 1>set pieces.</v>

46
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.873
<v Speaker 1>The first is that physics matters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we all know that superheroes do a </v>

47
00:02:53.571 --> 00:02:56.990
<v Speaker 1>lot of absurd things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Half the shots that iron man takes would</v>

48
00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.893
<v Speaker 1>he fatal blows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people have an intuitive sense for </v>

49
00:03:01.331 --> 00:03:02.164
<v Speaker 1>weight and velocity impact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why in camera action usually </v>

50
00:03:05.891 --> 00:03:07.990
<v Speaker 1>get some more visceral response from </v>
<v Speaker 1>audiences.</v>

51
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.460
<v Speaker 1>The physics are absolutely real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This doesn't mean that all CGI is bad,</v>

52
00:03:12.461 --> 00:03:13.294
<v Speaker 1>but if you're going to use CGI,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a good idea to pay a lot of </v>

53
00:03:15.311 --> 00:03:17.320
<v Speaker 1>attention to the cues that people pick </v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

54
00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.420
<v Speaker 1>And then the first set piece of winter </v>
<v Speaker 1>soldier,</v>

55
00:03:19.421 --> 00:03:20.254
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Russo brothers do a great job at </v>

56
00:03:22.301 --> 00:03:26.380
<v Speaker 1>gauging captain America strength level </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the audience with only a few shots.</v>

57
00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:27.603
<v Speaker 1>They lace these in with real hand to </v>
<v Speaker 1>hand combat to enhance the realism or </v>

58
00:03:31.061 --> 00:03:31.894
<v Speaker 1>take spiderman heavily CG character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's easy to establish his physics </v>

59
00:03:34.901 --> 00:03:35.734
<v Speaker 1>because he's swinging on elastic bands </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a different type of physics </v>

60
00:03:39.911 --> 00:03:43.930
<v Speaker 1>than Iron Mans or the hoax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Too often in DC movies,</v>

61
00:03:43.931 --> 00:03:44.764
<v Speaker 1>the physics just don't matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the camera is doing something that </v>

62
00:03:47.831 --> 00:03:51.910
<v Speaker 1>makes everything feel weightless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Taking away the real force of a punch.</v>

63
00:03:51.911 --> 00:03:52.744
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even understand the physics of </v>

64
00:03:53.981 --> 00:03:54.814
<v Speaker 1>how my toes and there's not enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference between the heroes for the </v>

65
00:04:00.311 --> 00:04:03.070
<v Speaker 1>audience to really feel the power </v>
<v Speaker 1>levels.</v>

66
00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.880
<v Speaker 1>Nothing is graceful or tactical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all just brute force.</v>

67
00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.690
<v Speaker 1>Which brings me to my second point is </v>
<v Speaker 1>scan st agnes.</v>

68
00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.060
<v Speaker 1>Use powers creatively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first time for everything.</v>

69
00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.153
<v Speaker 1>Angela.</v>

70
00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:20.023
<v Speaker 1>It's not always the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a good number of times in </v>

71
00:04:22.121 --> 00:04:22.954
<v Speaker 1>the marvel movies where powers interact </v>
<v Speaker 1>off of one another in ways that you </v>

72
00:04:26.171 --> 00:04:29.230
<v Speaker 1>can't predict how our full hundred </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent capacity.</v>

73
00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.033
<v Speaker 1>How about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or they take something routine like </v>

74
00:04:34.661 --> 00:04:39.661
<v Speaker 1>someone bailing from a car and just go </v>
<v Speaker 1>the extra step to DC films.</v>

75
00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:46.630
<v Speaker 1>Every character is a blunt instrument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only doing the most obvious thing,</v>

76
00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.943
<v Speaker 1>which in Superman's case is usually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This frustrates me so much because </v>

77
00:04:52.541 --> 00:04:53.374
<v Speaker 1>superman has a laundry list of powers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There has to be some way for him to </v>

78
00:04:57.101 --> 00:05:01.420
<v Speaker 1>combine them in a creative way to solve </v>
<v Speaker 1>a problem or defeat a clever villain.</v>

79
00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.090
<v Speaker 1>I know a good filmmaker can figure it </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

80
00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.850
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one thing that marvel is really good</v>

81
00:05:06.851 --> 00:05:07.684
<v Speaker 1>at is the ability to slip character </v>
<v Speaker 1>moments into the cracks of big set </v>

82
00:05:11.201 --> 00:05:14.110
<v Speaker 1>pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every action scene has its pauses.</v>

83
00:05:14.111 --> 00:05:14.944
<v Speaker 1>When everything stops in the characters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get to say a line or two for the simple </v>

84
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:19.043
<v Speaker 1>things like how much this is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here are the things that marvel </v>

85
00:05:22.691 --> 00:05:24.130
<v Speaker 1>character set on those pauses.</v>

86
00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.880
<v Speaker 1>Bulk funding meets you guys be more </v>
<v Speaker 1>handsome and taking on a squadron,</v>

87
00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:38.910
<v Speaker 1>and he didn't invite me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

88
00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:44.050
<v Speaker 1>who was laden with Alaska one time where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're from Queens,</v>

89
00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:51.093
<v Speaker 1>Brooklyn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now here are the things that DC </v>

90
00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:57.240
<v Speaker 1>characters say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to stop here.</v>

91
00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.370
<v Speaker 1>You ever estimate through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we'll see about that.</v>

92
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:08.420
<v Speaker 1>Next time they shine your light in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sky.</v>

93
00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:10.313
<v Speaker 1>Don't go into crafting good set pieces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>won't solve all the problems plaguing </v>

94
00:06:19.221 --> 00:06:22.280
<v Speaker 1>the EU.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't make for a good movie alone,</v>

95
00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:23.863
<v Speaker 1>but I think you'd be surprised how much </v>
<v Speaker 1>people forgive when they've had a </v>

96
00:06:26.691 --> 00:06:29.510
<v Speaker 1>genuinely bracing experience at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>theater.</v>

97
00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.390
<v Speaker 1>Eventually the people behind the DC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

98
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:36.500
<v Speaker 1>We'll figure it out until then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm afraid it's just going to be a whole</v>

99
00:06:36.501 --> 00:06:37.334
<v Speaker 1>lot of this.</v>

100
