1
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:14.673
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's a reason why it's not </v>

2
00:00:15.671 --> 00:00:20.671
<v Speaker 1>uncommon for audio files to use steely </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dan records to test the sound quality of</v>

3
00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:22.263
<v Speaker 1>new speakers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The band is among the most sonically </v>

4
00:00:24.851 --> 00:00:27.700
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated pop acts of the 20th and </v>
<v Speaker 1>21st century,</v>

5
00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:28.563
<v Speaker 1>not just an audio fidelity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the complexity of their jazz and </v>

6
00:00:31.811 --> 00:00:32.644
<v Speaker 1>blues influenced songs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today I want to break down one of my </v>

7
00:00:35.711 --> 00:00:37.780
<v Speaker 1>favorite steely Dan Songs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Deacon Blues,</v>

8
00:00:37.781 --> 00:00:38.614
<v Speaker 1>to show you what goes into making one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>these things and we might as well back </v>

9
00:00:42.671 --> 00:00:45.160
<v Speaker 1>up and start at the intro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I'll play again,</v>

10
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:00.143
<v Speaker 1>so that is one of the most recognizable </v>
<v Speaker 1>intros and steely Dan's whole </v>

11
00:01:02.821 --> 00:01:03.654
<v Speaker 1>discography because it features a unique</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of court that's become a defining </v>

12
00:01:07.441 --> 00:01:11.280
<v Speaker 1>feature of their music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called the MIU major court.</v>

13
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.173
<v Speaker 1>They called it that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a specific chord voicing that swaps a </v>

14
00:01:14.551 --> 00:01:17.670
<v Speaker 1>second degree note for a tonic note in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>major chord.</v>

15
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.460
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you take the c major chord,</v>

16
00:01:20.461 --> 00:01:21.191
<v Speaker 1>c,</v>
<v Speaker 1>g,</v>

17
00:01:21.191 --> 00:01:22.024
<v Speaker 1>C,</v>
<v Speaker 1>e,</v>

18
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.390
<v Speaker 1>and you switched the second c for a d </v>
<v Speaker 1>note,</v>

19
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.580
<v Speaker 1>you've made a c major chord and you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>hear a moon majors all throughout steely</v>

20
00:01:29.581 --> 00:01:32.460
<v Speaker 1>dance music like in the first chorus of </v>
<v Speaker 1>black cow,</v>

21
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:35.633
<v Speaker 1>the chorus of don't take me alive even </v>
<v Speaker 1>right here in their first album on fire </v>

22
00:01:44.761 --> 00:01:45.594
<v Speaker 1>in the hole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it should be noted that even though </v>

23
00:01:49.741 --> 00:01:50.574
<v Speaker 1>steely Dan squeezed the miu major for </v>
<v Speaker 1>all it's worth this voicing has a </v>

24
00:01:53.371 --> 00:01:56.070
<v Speaker 1>history that goes all the way back to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the twelfth century.</v>

25
00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.270
<v Speaker 1>The first time it was ever used was </v>
<v Speaker 1>imperative.</v>

26
00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.320
<v Speaker 1>The greats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitterroot ness.</v>

27
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.200
<v Speaker 1>Take a listen to the beautiful second </v>
<v Speaker 1>syllable of ness right here.</v>

28
00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:13.430
<v Speaker 1>After these quintessential expressions </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the [inaudible] major chord,</v>

29
00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.990
<v Speaker 1>the song dives into the first verse and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we begin to hear the story of a suburban</v>

30
00:02:17.991 --> 00:02:21.590
<v Speaker 1>man in crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fantasizing about becoming an alcoholic.</v>

31
00:02:21.591 --> 00:02:26.591
<v Speaker 1>Saxophone player.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instrumentation includes a Rhodes piano,</v>

32
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.930
<v Speaker 1>a base that sort of floats along,</v>
<v Speaker 1>carrying the rhythm.</v>

33
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.960
<v Speaker 1>Larry Carlton steadily holding the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Melody on Guitar,</v>

34
00:02:35.961 --> 00:02:36.794
<v Speaker 1>adding small frills which are hardly </v>
<v Speaker 1>noticeable but extremely important and </v>

35
00:02:40.341 --> 00:02:44.030
<v Speaker 1>that they keep you from getting bored </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the progression while complimenting</v>

36
00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.893
<v Speaker 1>vegans focus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have an acoustic guitar in there </v>

37
00:02:48.471 --> 00:02:50.990
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the Great Bernard Purdie,</v>

38
00:02:50.991 --> 00:02:53.780
<v Speaker 1>one of the best grooved drummers of all </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

39
00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:56.810
<v Speaker 1>It's ordered.</v>

40
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.020
<v Speaker 2>Call me up</v>

41
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.240
<v Speaker 1>if you listen to Deacon Blues on </v>
<v Speaker 1>headphones or speakers,</v>

42
00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.520
<v Speaker 1>and here just how good this music </v>
<v Speaker 1>sounds.</v>

43
00:03:13.521 --> 00:03:18.260
<v Speaker 1>Every instrument has its own life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Each sound is thick and close up when it</v>

44
00:03:18.261 --> 00:03:19.094
<v Speaker 1>needs to be to achieve this Vegan and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Becker at were explicit and following </v>

45
00:03:21.921 --> 00:03:26.150
<v Speaker 1>the example of legendary jazz producer </v>
<v Speaker 1>and engineer Rudy Van Gelder,</v>

46
00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.050
<v Speaker 1>whose work at blue note records defined </v>
<v Speaker 1>a generation of jazz music.</v>

47
00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.990
<v Speaker 1>Then Gilda was notoriously secretive </v>
<v Speaker 1>about his techniques,</v>

48
00:03:32.991 --> 00:03:33.824
<v Speaker 1>but it's known that he had musicians </v>
<v Speaker 1>played very close to the microphones to </v>

49
00:03:36.711 --> 00:03:38.870
<v Speaker 1>make his instruments sound warm and </v>
<v Speaker 1>intimate.</v>

50
00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:46.493
<v Speaker 1>Anyone who's used microphones like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>one I'm recording this narration on </v>

51
00:03:49.411 --> 00:03:50.244
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knows that every microphone has a </v>

52
00:03:51.991 --> 00:03:54.600
<v Speaker 1>different quality of sound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steely Dan's producer,</v>

53
00:03:54.601 --> 00:03:55.434
<v Speaker 1>Roger Nicole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>described his extensive microphone </v>

54
00:03:56.971 --> 00:03:57.804
<v Speaker 1>collection in an interview once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the point is that the band </v>

55
00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:00.773
<v Speaker 1>experimented exhaustively to get just </v>
<v Speaker 1>the right sound for each instrument and </v>

56
00:04:04.411 --> 00:04:05.244
<v Speaker 1>vocal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can hear right there that when we </v>

57
00:04:12.231 --> 00:04:15.260
<v Speaker 1>enter the second verse of Deacon Blues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a horn section comes in,</v>

58
00:04:15.261 --> 00:04:16.094
<v Speaker 1>composed by Tom Scott,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who detailed in a Washington Post </v>

59
00:04:18.591 --> 00:04:19.424
<v Speaker 1>interview,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how he modeled his horns after Oliver </v>

60
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:22.383
<v Speaker 1>Nelson's or Kestrel style in which </v>
<v Speaker 1>middle register horns slide against one </v>

61
00:04:25.611 --> 00:04:27.950
<v Speaker 1>another to create a thicker dissonant </v>
<v Speaker 1>sound.</v>

62
00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.540
<v Speaker 1>Vegan insisted Scott include nothing in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the high end,</v>

63
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:40.613
<v Speaker 1>and for this reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the bridge comes and the saxophone </v>

64
00:04:42.571 --> 00:04:43.404
<v Speaker 1>solo happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>personifying the main character of the </v>

65
00:04:45.241 --> 00:04:48.000
<v Speaker 1>song.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It cuts through the mix like a lightning</v>

66
00:04:48.001 --> 00:04:53.001
<v Speaker 1>bolt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because of the saxophone.</v>

67
00:04:54.821 --> 00:04:57.100
<v Speaker 1>Solo is such an important part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>song.</v>

68
00:04:57.101 --> 00:05:00.370
<v Speaker 1>Fagan and Becker searched for the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>player to embody the sound.</v>

69
00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.880
<v Speaker 1>One night they turned on the tonight </v>
<v Speaker 1>show with Johnny Carson.</v>

70
00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.350
<v Speaker 3>Saw this</v>

71
00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:10.163
<v Speaker 4>pete,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chris lead to work your saxophone and </v>

72
00:05:13.141 --> 00:05:18.141
<v Speaker 4>play what I feel very scotch whiskey all</v>
<v Speaker 4>night long guy behind the wheel.</v>

73
00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.920
<v Speaker 4>And I thought you were talking about my </v>
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>

74
00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:27.750
<v Speaker 4>So it was easy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just had to take one tape.</v>

75
00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:37.410
<v Speaker 3>Instrumentation on Deacon Boone</v>

76
00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:38.513
<v Speaker 1>is immaculate and complex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think the lyrics are just as </v>

77
00:05:41.721 --> 00:05:42.554
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Deacon Blues tells the story of a </v>

78
00:05:44.631 --> 00:05:47.990
<v Speaker 1>midlife crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a man living a safe life in suburbia,</v>

79
00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.033
<v Speaker 1>looking through the glass said gamblers </v>
<v Speaker 1>and wild ramblers seeing romance in the </v>

80
00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.080
<v Speaker 1>million lights of the city at night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wants to be a saxophonist,</v>

81
00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:58.250
<v Speaker 1>drink scotch whiskey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>die behind the wheels.</v>

82
00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.610
<v Speaker 1>Deacon Blues is a song of existential </v>
<v Speaker 1>desire,</v>

83
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:03.230
<v Speaker 1>a desire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as Becker says,</v>

84
00:06:03.231 --> 00:06:04.064
<v Speaker 1>for one of those mythic forms of loser,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dumb and opposite to the routine middle </v>

85
00:06:08.571 --> 00:06:13.571
<v Speaker 1>register existence that stretches life </v>
<v Speaker 1>to a thin film of small significance.</v>

86
00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:17.420
<v Speaker 1>Fagan and Becker have always been </v>
<v Speaker 1>sardonic and Rye songwriters,</v>

87
00:06:17.421 --> 00:06:20.180
<v Speaker 1>they're smooth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jazzy feel stands in direct,</v>

88
00:06:20.181 --> 00:06:21.014
<v Speaker 1>almost mocking opposition to the punk </v>
<v Speaker 1>rock sound that was gaining popularity </v>

89
00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:25.634
<v Speaker 1>at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's always a detachment in their </v>

90
00:06:27.741 --> 00:06:31.880
<v Speaker 1>songs and uncertainty about exactly who </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're making fun of.</v>

91
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:33.223
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they came up with the name of the Song </v>

92
00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:36.013
<v Speaker 1>Deacon Blues by recognizing how </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous it was to give sports teams </v>

93
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:42.440
<v Speaker 1>majestic nicknames like University of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Alabama's crimson tide.</v>

94
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.860
<v Speaker 1>This mocking tone has turned a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people off to their music,</v>

95
00:06:45.861 --> 00:06:46.694
<v Speaker 1>but Deacon Blues I think contains a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hidden earnestness in the lead into the </v>

96
00:06:50.421 --> 00:06:51.254
<v Speaker 1>first chorus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The narrator says he's ready to cross </v>

97
00:06:52.911 --> 00:06:53.744
<v Speaker 1>that fine line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The line between his existence and the </v>

98
00:06:56.001 --> 00:06:59.180
<v Speaker 1>one he wants to have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The song suggests that he's tried before</v>

99
00:06:59.181 --> 00:07:00.014
<v Speaker 1>and failed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the music place these lines like </v>

100
00:07:01.491 --> 00:07:02.324
<v Speaker 1>he's taking a running headstart </v>
<v Speaker 1>barreling toward a chorus that explodes </v>

101
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:07.670
<v Speaker 1>into the fantasy.</v>

102
00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:15.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm ready to die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For this reason,</v>

103
00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:37.520
<v Speaker 1>I think you can look at Deacon Blues as </v>
<v Speaker 1>a kind of literature.</v>

104
00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:38.683
<v Speaker 1>The story seems to be the central </v>
<v Speaker 1>component here with each element of the </v>

105
00:07:41.121 --> 00:07:41.954
<v Speaker 1>music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>filling out nuances and the main </v>

106
00:07:43.641 --> 00:07:44.474
<v Speaker 1>character is fantasy to the point where </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's unclear in the last verse whether </v>

107
00:07:47.451 --> 00:07:51.320
<v Speaker 1>the narrator has actually done it or </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just been caught up in the dream.</v>

108
00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:02.670
<v Speaker 2>I think listening to steely Dan with </v>
<v Speaker 2>some good headphones,</v>

109
00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:03.783
<v Speaker 1>rewards close reads like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The layers are all there for you to </v>

110
00:08:06.791 --> 00:08:10.960
<v Speaker 1>examine one by one or simply enjoy in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their combined expression.</v>

111
00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:12.303
<v Speaker 1>The quality is great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The composition is complex and the </v>

112
00:08:15.191 --> 00:08:16.024
<v Speaker 1>lyrics are interesting and dense for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of that adds up to a song that is </v>

113
00:08:20.501 --> 00:08:21.334
<v Speaker 1>going to last.</v>

114
00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:41.700
<v Speaker 1>Hey everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for watching.</v>

115
00:08:41.701 --> 00:08:42.534
<v Speaker 1>I love steely Dan and I love this </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I've never analyzed a song </v>

116
00:08:45.571 --> 00:08:46.404
<v Speaker 1>before and I love trying new things.</v>
