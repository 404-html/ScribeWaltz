1
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.870
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's an interesting story.</v>

2
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.220
<v Speaker 1>An amendment was made to the clean air </v>
<v Speaker 1>act in the United States,</v>

3
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.083
<v Speaker 1>aimed at reducing the release of carbon </v>
<v Speaker 1>monoxide into the atmosphere to reduce </v>

4
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:13.763
<v Speaker 1>air pollution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of the law mandated that gasoline </v>

5
00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:19.410
<v Speaker 1>and automobiles must have a minimum </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of oxygen at additive.</v>

6
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.273
<v Speaker 1>A chemical compound that helps fuel burn</v>
<v Speaker 1>more completely in this limits the </v>

7
00:00:23.731 --> 00:00:28.731
<v Speaker 1>certain carbon monoxide released into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the atmosphere from 1992 to 2005.</v>

8
00:00:29.221 --> 00:00:32.520
<v Speaker 1>The most popular oxidative for gasoline </v>
<v Speaker 1>was methyl,</v>

9
00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:34.740
<v Speaker 1>ethyl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ether or Mtbe,</v>

10
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:35.783
<v Speaker 1>but in the early two thousands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the number of cases of mtbe </v>

11
00:00:37.681 --> 00:00:41.670
<v Speaker 1>contaminating groundwater raised </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerns about its health effects.</v>

12
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.230
<v Speaker 1>Gasoline additive mtbe was first noticed</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the water in 2000.</v>

13
00:00:46.231 --> 00:00:48.450
<v Speaker 1>One residential reportedly got sick from</v>
<v Speaker 1>drinking it,</v>

14
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.680
<v Speaker 1>2004,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both New York and California banned that</v>

15
00:00:51.681 --> 00:00:55.050
<v Speaker 1>chemical from the state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A big blow considering Kelly and and why</v>

16
00:00:55.051 --> 00:00:58.680
<v Speaker 1>accounted for 40 percent of nationwide </v>
<v Speaker 1>mtbe consumption.</v>

17
00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:59.673
<v Speaker 1>A year later in 2005,</v>
<v Speaker 1>23 more states followed suit and band </v>

18
00:01:03.181 --> 00:01:04.980
<v Speaker 1>that chemical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In that same year,</v>

19
00:01:04.981 --> 00:01:05.814
<v Speaker 1>Congress passed the Energy Policy Act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which did not include provisions to </v>

20
00:01:09.571 --> 00:01:14.100
<v Speaker 1>shield MTB manufacturers from those </v>
<v Speaker 1>pesky water contamination lawsuits,</v>

21
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.460
<v Speaker 1>and so with no protections against </v>
<v Speaker 1>growing public outcry,</v>

22
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.443
<v Speaker 1>the country was forced to turn to </v>
<v Speaker 1>alternative ways of gasoline </v>

23
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:22.493
<v Speaker 1>oxygenation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What filled the void was ethanol in the </v>

24
00:01:24.991 --> 00:01:28.350
<v Speaker 1>last 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ethanol manufacturer and consumption has</v>

25
00:01:28.351 --> 00:01:29.184
<v Speaker 1>risen like a rocket ship in 2010.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The US was the world's top ethanol </v>

26
00:01:33.031 --> 00:01:33.864
<v Speaker 1>producer with 13 point 2 billion gallons</v>
<v Speaker 1>or 57 point five percent of global </v>

27
00:01:39.151 --> 00:01:41.050
<v Speaker 1>production.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ethanol is a biofuel,</v>

28
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.100
<v Speaker 1>which means that it's a fuel produced </v>
<v Speaker 1>from living organisms.</v>

29
00:01:44.101 --> 00:01:47.760
<v Speaker 1>In the case of America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the majority of ethanol comes from corn.</v>

30
00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:48.623
<v Speaker 1>The increase of demand for ethanol </v>
<v Speaker 1>driven in part by US legislation to </v>

31
00:01:51.541 --> 00:01:52.374
<v Speaker 1>reduce air pollution has led to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>widespread expansion of crop land to </v>

32
00:01:56.671 --> 00:01:57.504
<v Speaker 1>produce more corn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in the Midwest and Great </v>

33
00:01:59.431 --> 00:02:04.431
<v Speaker 1>Plains right smack Dab in the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the monarch butterfly migration path.</v>

34
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.860
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The butterflies dude,</v>

35
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:08.753
<v Speaker 1>indigenous to North America and </v>
<v Speaker 1>instantly recognizable to anyone who </v>

36
00:02:11.161 --> 00:02:12.750
<v Speaker 1>lives here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The monarch butterfly,</v>

37
00:02:12.751 --> 00:02:13.584
<v Speaker 1>it makes the longest and most </v>
<v Speaker 1>spectacular migration of any insect in </v>

38
00:02:17.671 --> 00:02:18.504
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every winter the monarch population </v>

39
00:02:19.681 --> 00:02:23.070
<v Speaker 1>flies 2,500</v>
<v Speaker 1>miles from its many homes in America and</v>

40
00:02:23.071 --> 00:02:23.904
<v Speaker 1>Canada to specific warm sites in Mexico </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Southern California on the way it </v>

41
00:02:28.201 --> 00:02:32.940
<v Speaker 1>lays eggs for the next generation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it can only lay them in one place.</v>

42
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:34.043
<v Speaker 1>Milkweed plant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an odd feature of nature that </v>

43
00:02:35.431 --> 00:02:38.640
<v Speaker 1>monarch larva eat milkweed leaves and </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing else,</v>

44
00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.890
<v Speaker 1>but they do and as much as monarch </v>
<v Speaker 1>larva.</v>

45
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.010
<v Speaker 1>Love that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Milkweed farmers hate it.</v>

46
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.790
<v Speaker 1>It's a week we'd reduce yield and less </v>
<v Speaker 1>yield means less money.</v>

47
00:02:47.791 --> 00:02:51.530
<v Speaker 1>So in addition to clearing pristine </v>
<v Speaker 1>lands in the great plains where milkweed</v>

48
00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:52.553
<v Speaker 1>thrives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>farmers have increasingly adopted </v>

49
00:02:54.181 --> 00:02:58.710
<v Speaker 1>genetically modified crops which are </v>
<v Speaker 1>resistant to herbicides like roundup.</v>

50
00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.910
<v Speaker 1>To introduce you to round up quick pro.</v>

51
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.313
<v Speaker 1>This product is produced by Monsanto.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a post emergent nonselective </v>

52
00:03:06.281 --> 00:03:07.330
<v Speaker 1>herbicide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Naturally,</v>

53
00:03:07.331 --> 00:03:10.960
<v Speaker 1>this poses a serious danger to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>population of the monarch butterfly,</v>

54
00:03:10.961 --> 00:03:15.961
<v Speaker 1>which has fallen a mindblowing 90 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent since its peak in 1996.</v>

55
00:03:16.211 --> 00:03:20.080
<v Speaker 1>The losses of milkweed are only part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason why the monarch population is</v>

56
00:03:20.081 --> 00:03:20.914
<v Speaker 1>crashing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>illegal deforestation of their winter </v>

57
00:03:22.601 --> 00:03:23.434
<v Speaker 1>home in Mexico and a couple of years of </v>
<v Speaker 1>bad weather have hurt their ability to </v>

58
00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.990
<v Speaker 1>make the long journey south and north </v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

59
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.033
<v Speaker 1>but even when conditions are right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>monarchs now have to fly farther and </v>

60
00:03:33.371 --> 00:03:37.840
<v Speaker 1>longer to find places to lay their eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Often they die before making it there.</v>

61
00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.900
<v Speaker 1>No one is talking about the extinction </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the monarch just yet,</v>

62
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.800
<v Speaker 1>but a 56 percent loss of monarch </v>
<v Speaker 1>population in one year,</v>

63
00:03:44.801 --> 00:03:45.634
<v Speaker 1>2013 is nothing to sneeze at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both America and Mexico have pledged to </v>

64
00:03:49.301 --> 00:03:52.120
<v Speaker 1>do what's necessary to save the monarch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you want to help,</v>

65
00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.090
<v Speaker 1>you can learn how to build butterfly </v>
<v Speaker 1>gardens in your backyard.</v>

66
00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to me this is an amazing story.</v>

67
00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.160
<v Speaker 1>A story of the unintended consequences </v>
<v Speaker 1>of human action on earth.</v>

68
00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:04.023
<v Speaker 1>Legislation passed in the US years ago </v>
<v Speaker 1>to fight pollution has come to pose a </v>

69
00:04:08.051 --> 00:04:11.920
<v Speaker 1>serious longterm threat to one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature's loveliest creatures.</v>

70
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.850
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly a cliche to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything in nature is connected,</v>

71
00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.193
<v Speaker 2>but it is.</v>
