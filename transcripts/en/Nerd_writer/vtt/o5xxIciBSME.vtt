1
00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:04.980
<v Speaker 1>Apple Needs Samsung,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me put that another way.</v>

2
00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.380
<v Speaker 1>Apple needs someone to manufacture the </v>
<v Speaker 1>oled screens on it's brand new,</v>

3
00:00:10.381 --> 00:00:14.000
<v Speaker 1>flagship smartphone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the iphone 10 and Samsung.</v>

4
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.150
<v Speaker 1>It's biggest smartphone competitor is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the only company that can do it.</v>

5
00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:19.213
<v Speaker 1>If you're wondering how Samsung stock </v>
<v Speaker 1>price could look like this in a year </v>

6
00:00:21.631 --> 00:00:22.464
<v Speaker 1>when the company had to replace them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fully recall and exploding phone in a </v>

7
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:26.843
<v Speaker 1>year when it's defacto.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chief Executive was sentenced to five </v>

8
00:00:28.501 --> 00:00:30.720
<v Speaker 1>years in jail for bribery and </v>
<v Speaker 1>embezzlement.</v>

9
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:31.973
<v Speaker 1>This is how most people know Samsung as </v>
<v Speaker 1>the company that sells them smartphones </v>

10
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.350
<v Speaker 1>and tvs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even refrigerators,</v>

11
00:00:37.351 --> 00:00:41.820
<v Speaker 1>but the strongest part of its business </v>
<v Speaker 1>is actually the components it builds for</v>

12
00:00:41.821 --> 00:00:42.654
<v Speaker 1>other companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>namely memory chips and displays like </v>

13
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.250
<v Speaker 1>the old display that's going into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>iphone 10 in these two key divisions.</v>

14
00:00:49.251 --> 00:00:50.084
<v Speaker 1>Samsung has the ability to supply </v>
<v Speaker 1>products quickly to meet a Gargantuan </v>

15
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.263
<v Speaker 1>worldwide demand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The name of the game is market share </v>

16
00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.520
<v Speaker 1>that they of course supply their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>devices with these components,</v>

17
00:00:59.521 --> 00:01:03.810
<v Speaker 1>but they want everyone else to turn to </v>
<v Speaker 1>them too and they're investing heavily,</v>

18
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.823
<v Speaker 1>almost $19,000,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>on new plants in the next four years to </v>

19
00:01:07.441 --> 00:01:09.150
<v Speaker 1>grab a bigger slice of that pie.</v>

20
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:10.313
<v Speaker 1>In July of this year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Samsung overtook Intel as the world's </v>

21
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:13.493
<v Speaker 1>number one chip maker and their </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance and owlette is even more </v>

22
00:01:16.291 --> 00:01:18.210
<v Speaker 1>extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As of the beginning of 2017,</v>

23
00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:21.210
<v Speaker 1>Samsung had over 90 percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>market share,</v>

24
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.253
<v Speaker 1>basically a monopoly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means when demand for Olin grows </v>

25
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.500
<v Speaker 1>like it has with the iphone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Samsung groves to apple,</v>

26
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.393
<v Speaker 1>you might guess hates the situation </v>
<v Speaker 1>because Samsung is the only old lead </v>

27
00:01:31.971 --> 00:01:35.160
<v Speaker 1>maker in the world who can handle the </v>
<v Speaker 1>demand for new iphones.</v>

28
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.100
<v Speaker 1>Samsung gets to set the price for </v>
<v Speaker 1>reference.</v>

29
00:01:38.101 --> 00:01:43.101
<v Speaker 1>Kgi Securities estimates that Samsung </v>
<v Speaker 1>will charge apple around 120 to $130 for</v>

30
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.513
<v Speaker 1>each oled screen compared to old lcd </v>
<v Speaker 1>screens which only cost apple about 45 </v>

31
00:01:48.991 --> 00:01:53.070
<v Speaker 1>to $55 and this may be a contributor to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the hefty $1,000</v>

32
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.810
<v Speaker 1>price tag on the iphone 10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This sort of thing has to,</v>

33
00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.800
<v Speaker 1>especially Tim Cook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apple Ceo Cooks,</v>

34
00:01:58.801 --> 00:01:59.634
<v Speaker 1>expertise is in supply chain in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>process of how products get made and </v>

35
00:02:02.971 --> 00:02:06.210
<v Speaker 1>distributed to customers and when he </v>
<v Speaker 1>joined apple in 1998,</v>

36
00:02:06.211 --> 00:02:07.044
<v Speaker 1>he was instrumental in overhauling the </v>
<v Speaker 1>supply chain and making it the most </v>

37
00:02:10.081 --> 00:02:11.730
<v Speaker 1>efficient in the world.</v>

38
00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:12.803
<v Speaker 1>One of the ways apple does this is by </v>
<v Speaker 1>outsourcing pretty much all of its </v>

39
00:02:15.061 --> 00:02:18.870
<v Speaker 1>production to suppliers mostly in Asia </v>
<v Speaker 1>who compete for their business,</v>

40
00:02:18.871 --> 00:02:22.290
<v Speaker 1>but in the case of oled screens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apple has no other choice but to go with</v>

41
00:02:22.291 --> 00:02:23.124
<v Speaker 1>Samsung.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apple wanted 80 million oled screens </v>

42
00:02:25.081 --> 00:02:28.530
<v Speaker 1>just for the second half of 2017.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one else can do that.</v>

43
00:02:28.531 --> 00:02:29.364
<v Speaker 1>Samsung barely has the capacity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the reasons why the </v>

44
00:02:31.201 --> 00:02:32.034
<v Speaker 1>iphone 10 comes out six weeks later than</v>
<v Speaker 1>the iphone eight in order to bring its </v>

45
00:02:35.521 --> 00:02:36.354
<v Speaker 1>own lead costs down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apple needs for there to be a serious </v>

46
00:02:38.191 --> 00:02:39.024
<v Speaker 1>competitor in this space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why it's investing two point </v>

47
00:02:41.461 --> 00:02:44.040
<v Speaker 1>$7,000,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>in LG display.</v>

48
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.330
<v Speaker 1>Basically a massive cash advance for </v>
<v Speaker 1>them to build up their capacity.</v>

49
00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:49.463
<v Speaker 1>Google has the same idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's investing $880 million dollars in </v>

50
00:02:51.991 --> 00:02:55.200
<v Speaker 1>to lg to break the Samsung monopoly for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the near future,</v>

51
00:02:55.201 --> 00:02:56.034
<v Speaker 1>though it doesn't quite matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Samsung is likely to be the major </v>

52
00:02:58.471 --> 00:03:02.170
<v Speaker 1>beneficiary of apple's lead needs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least through 2019.</v>

53
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.430
<v Speaker 1>Not to mention that we'll also be making</v>
<v Speaker 1>a huge number of theories.</v>

54
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:06.303
<v Speaker 1>Chips for apple to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the strangest relationships </v>

55
00:03:08.651 --> 00:03:09.484
<v Speaker 1>in business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apple and Samsung have been feuding for </v>

56
00:03:12.131 --> 00:03:16.450
<v Speaker 1>years ever since 2010 when Samsung </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially copied the iphone with their</v>

57
00:03:16.451 --> 00:03:17.284
<v Speaker 1>galaxy s smartphone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The two companies have been locked in </v>

58
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.580
<v Speaker 1>illegal war for almost seven years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That has cost Samsung $150,</v>

59
00:03:24.581 --> 00:03:27.490
<v Speaker 1>million dollars and maybe more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the end,</v>

60
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:28.383
<v Speaker 1>it seems silly because apple is still </v>
<v Speaker 1>shelling out millions upon millions to </v>

61
00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:37.000
<v Speaker 1>its archrival for parts bolstering </v>
<v Speaker 1>Samsung's huge profits and its growth.</v>

62
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.863
<v Speaker 1>The iphone x is sort of the perfect </v>
<v Speaker 1>symbol for the whole messy relationship </v>

63
00:03:41.561 --> 00:03:45.760
<v Speaker 1>and it captures how the tech business </v>
<v Speaker 1>works at the very highest level.</v>

64
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.330
<v Speaker 1>It's dysfunctional marriages like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apple Needs Samsung.</v>

65
00:03:49.331 --> 00:03:50.164
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Samsung is certainly profiting from </v>

66
00:03:51.941 --> 00:03:53.740
<v Speaker 1>the business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

67
00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.580
<v Speaker 1>these two mega companies really need </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Everybody.</v>
