1
00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:07.210
<v Speaker 1>Would you care for someone for sure have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do just answer my questions with.</v>

2
00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:11.370
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:13.913
<v Speaker 2>A few years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a friend and I went to the scientology </v>

4
00:00:15.901 --> 00:00:19.590
<v Speaker 2>complex in Los Angeles to see what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>religion was all about.</v>

5
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:20.603
<v Speaker 2>We were curious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talked about it actually one of the </v>

6
00:00:22.471 --> 00:00:26.190
<v Speaker 2>first episodes of the show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were touring around the facility,</v>

7
00:00:26.191 --> 00:00:30.630
<v Speaker 2>introduced to some very nice members and</v>
<v Speaker 2>given personality tests.</v>

8
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:31.733
<v Speaker 2>The test,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is officially called the Oxford </v>

9
00:00:33.421 --> 00:00:34.254
<v Speaker 2>capacity analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>though it has no connection with Oxford </v>

10
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.060
<v Speaker 2>University or any accredited </v>
<v Speaker 2>institution,</v>

11
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.000
<v Speaker 2>was more intense than I thought it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be.</v>

12
00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:42.834
<v Speaker 2>An included about 200 questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A few of which are actually reproduced </v>

13
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.190
<v Speaker 2>exactly in this scene from Paul Thomas </v>
<v Speaker 2>Anderson.</v>

14
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.940
<v Speaker 2>20 12 film the master do linger in bus </v>
<v Speaker 2>stations for pleasure.</v>

15
00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.190
<v Speaker 2>You muscles precedents for no reason to </v>
<v Speaker 2>past failures bother you.</v>

16
00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.740
<v Speaker 2>Would you like to be told what to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you find interest in other people?</v>

17
00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.780
<v Speaker 2>I often consumed my scientific usually </v>
<v Speaker 2>truthful to other unpredictable.</v>

18
00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.103
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This processing scene from the master </v>

19
00:01:14.571 --> 00:01:15.470
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion,</v>

20
00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.620
<v Speaker 2>one of the best sequences in one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>best movies of the last 10 years.</v>

21
00:01:18.621 --> 00:01:21.110
<v Speaker 2>It's simple,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brilliantly acted and hypnotic,</v>

22
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.100
<v Speaker 2>which is no mistake on the part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>filmmakers if you're interested.</v>

23
00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:24.943
<v Speaker 2>The scene offers some real insights into</v>
<v Speaker 2>how the religion of scientology </v>

24
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:28.633
<v Speaker 2>functions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Though PT Anderson has always been </v>

25
00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.213
<v Speaker 2>careful to say that the master is not an</v>
<v Speaker 2>exact retelling of scientology's </v>

26
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.980
<v Speaker 2>founding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The similarities in character,</v>

27
00:01:36.981 --> 00:01:40.610
<v Speaker 2>feeling and technique are hard to deny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

28
00:01:40.611 --> 00:01:41.444
<v Speaker 2>this scene,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the processing seen bears an </v>

29
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:43.753
<v Speaker 2>unmistakable resemblance to a vital </v>
<v Speaker 2>activity within scientology called </v>

30
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.953
<v Speaker 2>auditing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The term auditing comes from a word </v>

31
00:01:49.761 --> 00:01:53.540
<v Speaker 2>which means to listen in auditing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The person running the session is called</v>

32
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.433
<v Speaker 2>the auditor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The person receiving auditing is called </v>

33
00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.290
<v Speaker 2>a pre clear because he has not yet been </v>
<v Speaker 2>cleared of his reactive mind.</v>

34
00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.020
<v Speaker 2>In the master seen Lancaster Dod played </v>
<v Speaker 2>by Philip Seymour.</v>

35
00:02:03.021 --> 00:02:06.620
<v Speaker 2>Hoffman is the auditor and Freddie </v>
<v Speaker 2>played by Joaquin Phoenix.</v>

36
00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:07.663
<v Speaker 2>Is the pre clear like dod does here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The auditor in scientology asks </v>

37
00:02:10.341 --> 00:02:13.430
<v Speaker 2>questions of the pre clear with the goal</v>
<v Speaker 2>of reading him,</v>

38
00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:14.293
<v Speaker 2>of Ngrams,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the term for traumatic memories stored </v>

39
00:02:16.731 --> 00:02:17.564
<v Speaker 2>in what's called the reactive mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The auditor does this by helping the </v>

40
00:02:20.631 --> 00:02:23.960
<v Speaker 2>preclearance relive the experience that </v>
<v Speaker 2>caused the trauma.</v>

41
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.860
<v Speaker 2>When the pre-cleared has a cognition or </v>
<v Speaker 2>a positive realization,</v>

42
00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.023
<v Speaker 2>the session is completed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If this seems a little like </v>

43
00:02:30.951 --> 00:02:33.860
<v Speaker 2>psychoanalysis to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's because it is.</v>

44
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.080
<v Speaker 2>When l Ron Hubbard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the founder of scientology,</v>

45
00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.630
<v Speaker 2>laid down these methods in his book </v>
<v Speaker 2>dianetics.</v>

46
00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.980
<v Speaker 2>I think he genuinely believed that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>had devised a new kind of psychotherapy,</v>

47
00:02:42.981 --> 00:02:46.400
<v Speaker 2>something that was scientifically </v>
<v Speaker 2>rigorous and effective.</v>

48
00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:47.480
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as we know,</v>

49
00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.150
<v Speaker 2>dianetics is not scientifically </v>
<v Speaker 2>rigorous.</v>

50
00:02:50.151 --> 00:02:50.984
<v Speaker 2>It has been repeatedly rejected by all </v>
<v Speaker 2>mental health communities as a </v>

51
00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.490
<v Speaker 2>pseudoscience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which it is,</v>

52
00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:56.383
<v Speaker 2>but as we see in the master,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no doubt that the process of </v>

53
00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.410
<v Speaker 2>auditing can cause and effect.</v>

54
00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:02.503
<v Speaker 2>Where's your mother infringement back to</v>
<v Speaker 2>this time in the processing seen dod </v>

55
00:03:11.531 --> 00:03:12.364
<v Speaker 2>gets ready to admit to a series of past </v>
<v Speaker 2>traumas including the death of his </v>

56
00:03:15.641 --> 00:03:17.770
<v Speaker 2>father,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the institutionalization of his mother,</v>

57
00:03:17.771 --> 00:03:18.604
<v Speaker 2>his incestuous relationship with an aunt</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the Times that he killed people in </v>

58
00:03:22.421 --> 00:03:25.950
<v Speaker 2>war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He uses these to access the primary end,</v>

59
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:26.793
<v Speaker 2>Graham of the session,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Freddy's abandonment of the love of his </v>

60
00:03:29.441 --> 00:03:32.860
<v Speaker 2>life back home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in psychoanalysis dot achieves this</v>

61
00:03:32.861 --> 00:03:36.070
<v Speaker 2>by talking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by initiating and exchange that attempts</v>

62
00:03:36.071 --> 00:03:39.670
<v Speaker 2>to unlock things that are repressed or </v>
<v Speaker 2>hard to face,</v>

63
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
<v Speaker 2>but the methods used are different as as</v>
<v Speaker 2>long been believed by.</v>

64
00:03:43.001 --> 00:03:43.834
<v Speaker 2>It's critics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scientology auditing goes further than </v>

65
00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.080
<v Speaker 2>psychoanalysis or talk therapy because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it utilizes a form of command.</v>

66
00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.570
<v Speaker 2>GNOSIS.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say Your name.</v>

67
00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.470
<v Speaker 2>Say it again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Freddy.</v>

68
00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.290
<v Speaker 2>Well say it again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Freddy quilt and again Friday.</v>

69
00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:00.173
<v Speaker 2>Quell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All throughout the dod works to bring </v>

70
00:04:01.981 --> 00:04:02.814
<v Speaker 2>Freddy under his command and the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>part which is structured a lot like the </v>

71
00:04:05.761 --> 00:04:06.594
<v Speaker 2>personality test.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He asks them a series of relatively </v>

72
00:04:08.821 --> 00:04:09.654
<v Speaker 2>simple yes or no questions getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>freddy used to this call and response </v>

73
00:04:13.231 --> 00:04:16.920
<v Speaker 2>pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Utilizing repetition to induce a relaxed</v>

74
00:04:16.921 --> 00:04:21.580
<v Speaker 2>and focused state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In past failures bother you know,</v>

75
00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.300
<v Speaker 2>do your past failures.</v>

76
00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:25.323
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

77
00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.400
<v Speaker 2>Do you pass values bother you?</v>

78
00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.050
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do your past failures in life either you</v>

79
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.320
<v Speaker 2>repetition also signals toward important</v>
<v Speaker 2>status,</v>

80
00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.060
<v Speaker 2>trying to get freddy to unconsciously </v>
<v Speaker 2>focus on his past failures.</v>

81
00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:46.710
<v Speaker 2>After this brief mini session ends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Freddy insists on more and data degrees,</v>

82
00:04:46.711 --> 00:04:47.544
<v Speaker 2>but this time with the caveat that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Freddy can't blink or the round of </v>

83
00:04:50.131 --> 00:04:52.020
<v Speaker 2>questioning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll start again from the beginning.</v>

84
00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.580
<v Speaker 2>This extra strain occupies Freddy's </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscious mind and with the priming from</v>

85
00:04:56.581 --> 00:04:57.414
<v Speaker 2>the first part established,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he begins to answer the questions with </v>

86
00:04:59.131 --> 00:04:59.964
<v Speaker 2>more openness and candor I've ever had </v>
<v Speaker 2>intercourse with someone inside your </v>

87
00:05:02.881 --> 00:05:03.740
<v Speaker 2>family?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

88
00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:06.593
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever had intercourse with </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone inside your family had been </v>

89
00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:11.483
<v Speaker 2>killed?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyone?</v>

90
00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.570
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe not me.</v>

91
00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:14.543
<v Speaker 2>Have you killed anyone?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Know How many times did you have </v>

92
00:05:16.801 --> 00:05:18.630
<v Speaker 2>intercourse with your hand?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three times,</v>

93
00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:19.673
<v Speaker 2>whereas no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what you'd like to have </v>

94
00:05:21.031 --> 00:05:21.864
<v Speaker 2>intercourse with her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

95
00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:23.283
<v Speaker 2>with the patterns set dot increases the </v>
<v Speaker 2>intensity and increases the intensity </v>

96
00:05:26.141 --> 00:05:30.100
<v Speaker 2>and increases the intensity to such a </v>
<v Speaker 2>pitch that freddy is visibly tensing up.</v>

97
00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:34.090
<v Speaker 2>Then at the most charged moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dot breaks the pattern and asks,</v>

98
00:05:34.091 --> 00:05:35.470
<v Speaker 2>ready to close his eyes.</v>

99
00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.050
<v Speaker 2>The emotion of this moment is real </v>
<v Speaker 2>dislike.</v>

100
00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:49.093
<v Speaker 2>Hypnosis is real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like psychotherapy and </v>

101
00:05:50.721 --> 00:05:51.554
<v Speaker 2>psychoanalysis are real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's because cognitive activity is </v>

102
00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.233
<v Speaker 2>real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can be harnessed and manipulated and </v>

103
00:05:58.131 --> 00:06:02.360
<v Speaker 2>projected and seen from new angles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Auditing is at the center of Scientology</v>

104
00:06:02.361 --> 00:06:03.194
<v Speaker 2>because it can produce these feelings of</v>
<v Speaker 2>epiphany that convinced people that the </v>

105
00:06:07.071 --> 00:06:09.770
<v Speaker 2>methods which achieve it must be </v>
<v Speaker 2>correct.</v>

106
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:11.503
<v Speaker 2>That's the danger of scientology to mean</v>
<v Speaker 2>hypnotherapy is a valid form of </v>

107
00:06:14.601 --> 00:06:16.160
<v Speaker 2>treatment for those who want to seek it </v>
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>

108
00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:21.470
<v Speaker 2>but scientology flatly denies that </v>
<v Speaker 2>auditing utilizes any hypnosis at all,</v>

109
00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:22.763
<v Speaker 2>so the people like Freddy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who experienced it unknowingly are </v>

110
00:06:25.311 --> 00:06:26.144
<v Speaker 2>susceptible to coercive suggestion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whether it's done maliciously or by </v>

111
00:06:29.901 --> 00:06:30.734
<v Speaker 2>someone not properly trained.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can be persuaded to believe that the </v>

112
00:06:33.501 --> 00:06:34.334
<v Speaker 2>church is right with a capital r and </v>
<v Speaker 2>thus deserves all the time and money </v>

113
00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:39.110
<v Speaker 2>they're asked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To give it.</v>

114
00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:44.280
<v Speaker 4>To make it clear all you have to do a </v>
<v Speaker 4>show fellow that he's mocking up his own</v>

115
00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:46.800
<v Speaker 4>mind,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bear for his own difficulties,</v>

116
00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:53.240
<v Speaker 4>and that he is not a completely adrift </v>
<v Speaker 4>in am swamped by a body,</v>

117
00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.550
<v Speaker 4>and there he is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've got to clear.</v>

118
00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:00.783
<v Speaker 2>Hubbard held that auditing like we see </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the master was the way to quote </v>

119
00:07:05.321 --> 00:07:09.070
<v Speaker 2>unquote clear every single person on </v>
<v Speaker 2>earth when that's your claim,</v>

120
00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:09.933
<v Speaker 2>there can be no uncertainty in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>methods when uncertainty is the one </v>

121
00:07:13.631 --> 00:07:16.870
<v Speaker 2>thing that binds all forms of mental </v>
<v Speaker 2>health.</v>

122
00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.960
<v Speaker 2>We don't understand all the ways the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mind works,</v>

123
00:07:19.961 --> 00:07:20.794
<v Speaker 2>probably we never will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but psychotherapy and psychiatry </v>

124
00:07:23.471 --> 00:07:24.304
<v Speaker 2>functioning within a scientific </v>
<v Speaker 2>community within a code of ethics that </v>

125
00:07:27.251 --> 00:07:28.084
<v Speaker 2>protects from abuse as made advances,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that can help those who are struggling </v>

126
00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:35.260
<v Speaker 2>to cope with life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not perfect,</v>

127
00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:39.610
<v Speaker 2>but it's a hell of a lot better than </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientology.</v>

128
00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:40.843
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
