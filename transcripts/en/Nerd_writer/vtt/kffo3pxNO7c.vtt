1
00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:11.980
<v Speaker 1>I carry your heart with me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high county it in my home.</v>

2
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm never without it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anywhere I go,</v>

3
00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:18.193
<v Speaker 1>you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My idea and whatever is done by only me </v>

4
00:00:21.501 --> 00:00:26.501
<v Speaker 1>is your doing my daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fear no fate for you are my fate,</v>

5
00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.590
<v Speaker 1>my suite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want no world war.</v>

6
00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.930
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are my world,</v>

7
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.393
<v Speaker 1>my crew and h you a whatever a moon has </v>
<v Speaker 1>always meant and whatever his son will </v>

8
00:00:44.271 --> 00:00:49.271
<v Speaker 1>always saying is you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here is the deepest secret.</v>

9
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.173
<v Speaker 1>Nobody knows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here is the root of the root and the </v>

10
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.990
<v Speaker 1>Bardo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bug and the sky and the sky.</v>

11
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:09.020
<v Speaker 1>The tree called light which grows higher</v>
<v Speaker 1>than so ken,</v>

12
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.760
<v Speaker 1>Whoa or mind can hide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is the one.</v>

13
00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:26.010
<v Speaker 1>It's keeping the stars a park.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I carry your heart.</v>

14
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.250
<v Speaker 1>I carry it in my house</v>

15
00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.960
<v Speaker 2>of all the many highly experimental </v>
<v Speaker 2>poems by e,</v>

16
00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.070
<v Speaker 2>e Dot Cummings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I carry your heart with me.</v>

17
00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.110
<v Speaker 2>I carry it in is among the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>straightforward and approachable.</v>

18
00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.340
<v Speaker 2>It's the one you're most likely to hear </v>
<v Speaker 2>at weddings or at weddings.</v>

19
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.070
<v Speaker 2>In romcoms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I carry your heart with me.</v>

20
00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.070
<v Speaker 2>I carry it in my heart and because this </v>
<v Speaker 2>poem seems effortless,</v>

21
00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.233
<v Speaker 2>it feels pulled out of time too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that was what I wanted to make </v>

22
00:02:01.871 --> 00:02:02.704
<v Speaker 2>this poem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>universal quintessential love poem for </v>

23
00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:06.880
<v Speaker 2>the Modern Age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

24
00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.540
<v Speaker 2>just take a look at the five concrete </v>
<v Speaker 2>images that he uses.</v>

25
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.340
<v Speaker 2>Hearts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Moon,</v>

26
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.740
<v Speaker 2>Sun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tree stars.</v>

27
00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.430
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to imagine five symbols more </v>
<v Speaker 2>archetypal,</v>

28
00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.330
<v Speaker 2>so the intention here is clearly </v>
<v Speaker 2>universal appeal,</v>

29
00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:23.583
<v Speaker 2>but that's not a slight on the poems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Construction or it's meaning just the </v>

30
00:02:27.071 --> 00:02:27.970
<v Speaker 2>opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

31
00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.840
<v Speaker 2>as Yates once brilliantly wrote about </v>
<v Speaker 2>his own craft,</v>

32
00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.390
<v Speaker 2>align will take us hours maybe yet if it</v>
<v Speaker 2>does not seem a moment's thought,</v>

33
00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.660
<v Speaker 2>our stitching and unsticking has been </v>
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>

34
00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:42.011
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First,</v>

35
00:02:42.011 --> 00:02:45.220
<v Speaker 2>let's take a look at the formal </v>
<v Speaker 2>construction of I carry your heart.</v>

36
00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:46.323
<v Speaker 2>The first thing to notice is that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>poem is split into two overlapping </v>

37
00:02:49.421 --> 00:02:50.254
<v Speaker 2>parts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything that's outside the </v>

38
00:02:52.001 --> 00:02:54.520
<v Speaker 2>parentheses and everything that's inside</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

39
00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.610
<v Speaker 2>This follows the theme setup in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first line,</v>

40
00:02:57.611 --> 00:02:58.444
<v Speaker 2>the theme of the narrators lover being </v>
<v Speaker 2>contained within his heart and vice </v>

41
00:03:02.621 --> 00:03:05.320
<v Speaker 2>versa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This reciprocal relationship is hammered</v>

42
00:03:05.321 --> 00:03:08.200
<v Speaker 2>home in the first stanza with anywhere I</v>
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

43
00:03:08.201 --> 00:03:12.250
<v Speaker 2>you go and whatever is done by only me </v>
<v Speaker 2>is your doing.</v>

44
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.923
<v Speaker 2>Every statement in this poem is followed</v>
<v Speaker 2>by a parent theoretical statement and </v>

45
00:03:17.231 --> 00:03:21.850
<v Speaker 2>frequently keywords used outside of them</v>
<v Speaker 2>are found inside as well.</v>

46
00:03:21.851 --> 00:03:24.130
<v Speaker 2>Linking the two parts and the two </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

47
00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:25.413
<v Speaker 2>Parentheses are the perfect punctuation </v>
<v Speaker 2>to use because visually they actually </v>

48
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.390
<v Speaker 2>represent the image of containment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's critic Roy.</v>

49
00:03:32.391 --> 00:03:33.224
<v Speaker 2>Tarkovsky has observed cummings find </v>
<v Speaker 2>several poetic functions from the </v>

50
00:03:36.821 --> 00:03:37.654
<v Speaker 2>parentheses throughout his work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's to convey intimacy or </v>

51
00:03:40.751 --> 00:03:45.550
<v Speaker 2>protection or to give a direct address </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the subject or like we just discussed</v>

52
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.450
<v Speaker 2>to use it's crescent shape as an icon in</v>
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>

53
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:50.793
<v Speaker 2>The neatest Tarkovsky notes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>parentheses have a somewhat </v>

54
00:03:52.961 --> 00:03:56.200
<v Speaker 2>contradictory place and all our writing </v>
<v Speaker 2>formally,</v>

55
00:03:56.201 --> 00:03:57.034
<v Speaker 2>they're supposed to contain throwaway </v>
<v Speaker 2>information stuff that would </v>

56
00:03:59.741 --> 00:04:03.130
<v Speaker 2>theoretically be perfectly okay to leave</v>
<v Speaker 2>out what?</v>

57
00:04:03.131 --> 00:04:03.964
<v Speaker 2>Because of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they don't have to be there and </v>

58
00:04:06.101 --> 00:04:06.934
<v Speaker 2>yet still our parents political comments</v>
<v Speaker 2>call attention to themselves for </v>

59
00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.380
<v Speaker 2>grounding their content swell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>backgrounding them at the same time.</v>

60
00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:15.573
<v Speaker 2>Ambiguity like that is exactly what </v>
<v Speaker 2>cummings loves to play with and it </v>

61
00:04:19.391 --> 00:04:21.220
<v Speaker 2>reinforces the poems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>themes.</v>

62
00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.700
<v Speaker 2>Clearly Cummings is using the parents </v>
<v Speaker 2>medicals for intimacy.</v>

63
00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.550
<v Speaker 2>You can see that in his additions of my </v>
<v Speaker 2>dear,</v>

64
00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:28.900
<v Speaker 2>my darling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my suite,</v>

65
00:04:28.901 --> 00:04:29.734
<v Speaker 2>my true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he also uses them to develop his </v>

66
00:04:31.781 --> 00:04:34.740
<v Speaker 2>philosophy of self and love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

67
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:35.583
<v Speaker 2>for Cummings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>love is a condition in which to </v>

68
00:04:37.181 --> 00:04:38.014
<v Speaker 2>fragmented selves come together to form </v>
<v Speaker 2>a more perfect unity and if there's one </v>

69
00:04:42.101 --> 00:04:42.934
<v Speaker 2>great theme in his collected work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the importance of being a truly </v>

70
00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:51.030
<v Speaker 2>transcendental he alive individual </v>
<v Speaker 2>against the doling and alienating forces</v>

71
00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:52.323
<v Speaker 2>of modern progress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the individual self was always a </v>

72
00:04:55.031 --> 00:04:56.860
<v Speaker 2>problematic idea for cummings.</v>

73
00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.843
<v Speaker 2>Whereas sometimes he evolved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That man is a miraculously whole human </v>

74
00:05:00.911 --> 00:05:03.850
<v Speaker 2>being elsewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like in the same sentence,</v>

75
00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:09.060
<v Speaker 2>he says that man's only happiness is to </v>
<v Speaker 2>transcend himself again and again.</v>

76
00:05:09.281 --> 00:05:14.281
<v Speaker 2>His poetry affirms that transcendence </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes with losing the self in love.</v>

77
00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.950
<v Speaker 2>Whether it said gracefully outright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when he writes,</v>

78
00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:19.173
<v Speaker 2>losing through you what seemed myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find selves unimaginably mine or it's </v>

79
00:05:26.261 --> 00:05:27.094
<v Speaker 2>demonstrated in some formal fireworks </v>
<v Speaker 2>like in this poem where the you and me </v>

80
00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:32.373
<v Speaker 2>is literally fused together and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>speaker has difficulty determining what </v>

81
00:05:36.281 --> 00:05:37.114
<v Speaker 2>form of the verb is best to use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Loves ability to transcend is the focus </v>

82
00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:46.260
<v Speaker 2>of I carrier heart and cummings is using</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever he can to explore it.</v>

83
00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.890
<v Speaker 2>Different connotations of transcendence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just take a look at the third stanza.</v>

84
00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:55.570
<v Speaker 2>Love is literally a cosmic force that </v>
<v Speaker 2>holds the stars in the firmament,</v>

85
00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:57.003
<v Speaker 2>but it's also the deepest secret and </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming suggests this deepness by </v>

86
00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.680
<v Speaker 2>nesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the secret in parentheses,</v>

87
00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.320
<v Speaker 2>which are themselves nested into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>poem,</v>

88
00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:07.393
<v Speaker 2>and the secret is buried further in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>root of the root and the bud of the bud </v>

89
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:15.620
<v Speaker 2>and the symbols I mentioned earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>son and particularly moon,</v>

90
00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.680
<v Speaker 2>are symbols of transcendence throughout </v>
<v Speaker 2>his poetry.</v>

91
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:19.783
<v Speaker 2>I mean what has the moon always meant to</v>
<v Speaker 2>cummings in a great essay by cummings </v>

92
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.920
<v Speaker 2>critic Martin Hooser,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I'll link to below the moon.</v>

93
00:06:25.921 --> 00:06:28.130
<v Speaker 2>Significance is traced across several </v>
<v Speaker 2>poems.</v>

94
00:06:28.131 --> 00:06:31.580
<v Speaker 2>It's variously described as a remarkable</v>
<v Speaker 2>splinter,</v>

95
00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.430
<v Speaker 2>dainty madden was watch spring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a balloon,</v>

96
00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:38.780
<v Speaker 2>a big red dog mystery as having small </v>
<v Speaker 2>hands,</v>

97
00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:39.863
<v Speaker 2>and as the shyest metaphor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cummings has a transcendental reverence </v>

98
00:06:43.521 --> 00:06:44.354
<v Speaker 2>for the moon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he has a hard time pinning it down </v>

99
00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:49.700
<v Speaker 2>in language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's the shyest metaphor,</v>

100
00:06:49.701 --> 00:06:50.534
<v Speaker 2>many then he attempt to understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to know it will result in the symbol </v>

101
00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:54.403
<v Speaker 2>fleeing further away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what the moon has always meant </v>

102
00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:01.180
<v Speaker 2>to cummings and it's the way he feels </v>
<v Speaker 2>about love and poetry too,</v>

103
00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:03.530
<v Speaker 2>in his notes which are collected at </v>
<v Speaker 2>Harvard,</v>

104
00:07:03.531 --> 00:07:04.364
<v Speaker 2>he once wrote to know is to possess and </v>
<v Speaker 2>any fact is possessed by everyone who </v>

105
00:07:09.081 --> 00:07:09.914
<v Speaker 2>knows it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas those who feel the truth are </v>

106
00:07:13.371 --> 00:07:14.204
<v Speaker 2>possessed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not possessors like the great American </v>

107
00:07:17.511 --> 00:07:18.344
<v Speaker 2>transcendentalists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cummings believes truth in poetry and </v>

108
00:07:21.171 --> 00:07:26.171
<v Speaker 2>love cannot be comprehended,</v>
<v Speaker 2>only experienced with his poetry and all</v>

109
00:07:27.651 --> 00:07:32.300
<v Speaker 2>its intense experimentation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He attempts to short circuit our impulse</v>

110
00:07:32.301 --> 00:07:35.630
<v Speaker 2>toward knowing so that we might </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience language.</v>

111
00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:40.740
<v Speaker 2>A new I carry your heart is a rare </v>
<v Speaker 2>attempt at clarity and form and content.</v>

112
00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:46.670
<v Speaker 2>It points toward love just as it points </v>
<v Speaker 2>toward cummings philosophy,</v>

113
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:48.103
<v Speaker 2>but it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Magic is in the way it unfolds </v>

114
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:56.110
<v Speaker 2>effortlessly in a rhythm and cadence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Harmonious with feeling.</v>

115
00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:01.800
<v Speaker 2>Hey everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thanks for watching.</v>
