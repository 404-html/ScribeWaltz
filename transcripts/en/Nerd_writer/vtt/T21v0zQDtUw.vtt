00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.760
<v Speaker 1>We survived the blizzard coffee on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tuesday and blog,</v>

2
00:00:02.761 --> 00:00:03.594
<v Speaker 1>49.</v>

3
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.533
<v Speaker 1>Life often perfectly manageable is </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes subject to intense and </v>

4
00:00:19.471 --> 00:00:20.304
<v Speaker 1>revealing human moments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Moments when the inscrutable veil that </v>

5
00:00:22.831 --> 00:00:23.664
<v Speaker 1>is the exterior of ourselves suddenly </v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes transparent so that anyone in </v>

6
00:00:27.391 --> 00:00:30.960
<v Speaker 1>the vicinity who can see us can also see</v>
<v Speaker 1>through us.</v>

7
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:31.853
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you've ever been embarrassed or seen </v>

8
00:00:33.571 --> 00:00:35.400
<v Speaker 1>someone embarrassed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

9
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.320
<v Speaker 1>The machinations behind the eyes </v>
<v Speaker 1>normally,</v>

10
00:00:37.321 --> 00:00:38.154
<v Speaker 1>so swift and indecipherable fall away </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you are left with the person so </v>

11
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.263
<v Speaker 1>utterly and pathetically readable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We try our best to avoid moments like </v>

12
00:00:45.361 --> 00:00:47.430
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in our interest to be a mystery.</v>

13
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.470
<v Speaker 1>Most of the time in social </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships,</v>

14
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.453
<v Speaker 1>people value unpredictability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're unpredictable and there is no </v>

15
00:00:53.791 --> 00:00:57.600
<v Speaker 1>nakedness more naked than the experience</v>
<v Speaker 1>of being figured out,</v>

16
00:00:57.601 --> 00:00:58.434
<v Speaker 1>but here at nerdwriter industries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we love this kind of moment because it </v>

17
00:01:01.141 --> 00:01:04.200
<v Speaker 1>tells us something about people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about naked people,</v>

18
00:01:04.201 --> 00:01:06.540
<v Speaker 1>and we love people at their most naked.</v>

19
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.120
<v Speaker 1>No way that that came out wrong or did </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

20
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.280
<v Speaker 1>I live in New York City and I ride the </v>
<v Speaker 1>subway everyday.</v>

21
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.143
<v Speaker 1>The subway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a cafe is a place where people are </v>

22
00:01:17.131 --> 00:01:17.964
<v Speaker 1>alone together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people read books or listen to </v>

23
00:01:20.281 --> 00:01:22.110
<v Speaker 1>music or just stare off into the middle </v>
<v Speaker 1>distance.</v>

24
00:01:22.111 --> 00:01:26.190
<v Speaker 1>The subway is not a destination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a place between destinations and we</v>

25
00:01:26.191 --> 00:01:28.620
<v Speaker 1>have no intention of making it a </v>
<v Speaker 1>destination,</v>

26
00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:31.350
<v Speaker 1>so we all agree not to speak to one </v>
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>

27
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.213
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one thing about the New York subway is </v>

28
00:01:33.091 --> 00:01:35.550
<v Speaker 1>that it does have panhandlers homeless </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

29
00:01:35.551 --> 00:01:36.384
<v Speaker 1>people down on their luck asking for </v>
<v Speaker 1>money and it's a pretty frequent </v>

30
00:01:38.941 --> 00:01:42.000
<v Speaker 1>occurrence exacerbated I'd imagined by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the state of the economy.</v>

31
00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:43.920
<v Speaker 1>These people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite their misfortunes,</v>

32
00:01:43.921 --> 00:01:44.754
<v Speaker 1>wield and incredible power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they come onto the train and give </v>

33
00:01:47.041 --> 00:01:48.750
<v Speaker 1>their speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>always practiced,</v>

34
00:01:48.751 --> 00:01:49.584
<v Speaker 1>always forceful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They create one of these intense and </v>

35
00:01:51.931 --> 00:01:52.764
<v Speaker 1>revealing human moments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a subway car of 50 opaque souls </v>

36
00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.360
<v Speaker 1>becomes as transparent as clean water as</v>
<v Speaker 1>the downtrodden person,</v>

37
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.700
<v Speaker 1>either with musical instruments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sad face child or an associate.</v>

38
00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:04.553
<v Speaker 1>A dog comes down the subway car in hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They force each and every writer to </v>

39
00:02:08.341 --> 00:02:11.760
<v Speaker 1>confront their desperation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A couple give a few coins or a dollar.</v>

40
00:02:11.761 --> 00:02:15.840
<v Speaker 1>Some look up and shake their heads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people just stare aggressively into</v>

41
00:02:15.841 --> 00:02:16.674
<v Speaker 1>their books or at their feet ignoring </v>
<v Speaker 1>and refusing the shameless person's </v>

42
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.550
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People on the subway don't want this.</v>

43
00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:24.443
<v Speaker 1>That's obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A beggar violates the agreed rules of </v>

44
00:02:26.191 --> 00:02:27.024
<v Speaker 1>the situation not to interact with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fact is that this person who may need </v>

45
00:02:29.521 --> 00:02:33.600
<v Speaker 1>food or money to house their children or</v>
<v Speaker 1>money to pay for power has presented the</v>

46
00:02:33.601 --> 00:02:36.510
<v Speaker 1>train car with an explicit moral </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

47
00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.200
<v Speaker 1>Should you give them money or not try as</v>
<v Speaker 1>we might.</v>

48
00:02:40.201 --> 00:02:44.040
<v Speaker 1>There is no way once posed not to answer</v>
<v Speaker 1>this question.</v>

49
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.903
<v Speaker 1>I guess that the writers intuitive </v>
<v Speaker 1>dislike of being forced to do something </v>

50
00:02:47.611 --> 00:02:48.444
<v Speaker 1>in a place where they expect to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing is what influences most of them </v>

51
00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.730
<v Speaker 1>not to give and make no mistake.</v>

52
00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.390
<v Speaker 1>Most people don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This echoes the theme of my last Vlog.</v>

53
00:02:57.391 --> 00:02:59.830
<v Speaker 1>We use our reason to justify our </v>
<v Speaker 1>feelings.</v>

54
00:02:59.831 --> 00:03:01.660
<v Speaker 1>If you're offended by this person to </v>
<v Speaker 1>start,</v>

55
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.740
<v Speaker 1>then here are some reasons not to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they won't use the money for food,</v>

56
00:03:05.741 --> 00:03:06.970
<v Speaker 1>but instead for drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe.</v>

57
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.400
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'm making the problem worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is my money.</v>

58
00:03:09.401 --> 00:03:11.200
<v Speaker 1>I earned it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I worked hard for it.</v>

59
00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.063
<v Speaker 1>They have no right to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have enough money myself to be </v>

60
00:03:13.541 --> 00:03:14.890
<v Speaker 1>giving it away to others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

61
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.490
<v Speaker 1>I only have a $5 bill in my wallet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I had a dollar bill or some coins,</v>

62
00:03:18.491 --> 00:03:20.260
<v Speaker 1>you know I do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know five's too much.</v>

63
00:03:20.261 --> 00:03:21.094
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This will only perpetuate their </v>

64
00:03:22.421 --> 00:03:23.680
<v Speaker 1>homelessness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know about these things.</v>

65
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.350
<v Speaker 1>They need to get a job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't give everyday how much,</v>

66
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.620
<v Speaker 1>how much they want for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to solve their problems is</v>

67
00:03:29.621 --> 00:03:30.700
<v Speaker 1>useless to give it all.</v>

68
00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.520
<v Speaker 1>If your inclination on the other hand is</v>
<v Speaker 1>to give,</v>

69
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:34.473
<v Speaker 1>then you have to ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should you give every time and how much </v>

70
00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.910
<v Speaker 1>and to whom and knowing that beggars are</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be on the subway.</v>

71
00:03:39.911 --> 00:03:41.830
<v Speaker 1>Should you be sure to have money with </v>
<v Speaker 1>you always.</v>

72
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.290
<v Speaker 1>When you leave the house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should you beat yourself up?</v>

73
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.330
<v Speaker 1>When you forget,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it enough to deal with poverty?</v>

74
00:03:46.331 --> 00:03:49.360
<v Speaker 1>Only when it crosses your path,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should you be allowed to feel good about</v>

75
00:03:49.361 --> 00:03:50.194
<v Speaker 1>yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you give only once and it's only a </v>

76
00:03:51.911 --> 00:03:52.744
<v Speaker 1>die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are no easy answers to these </v>

77
00:03:54.101 --> 00:03:56.140
<v Speaker 1>questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nor is there an easy answer to the first</v>

78
00:03:56.141 --> 00:03:58.630
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one in the moment when they hold out</v>

79
00:03:58.631 --> 00:03:59.464
<v Speaker 1>their hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all I can say is trying not to make the </v>

80
00:04:02.081 --> 00:04:06.550
<v Speaker 1>perfect the enemy of the good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I do know is that the no stops this</v>

81
00:04:06.551 --> 00:04:07.384
<v Speaker 1>line of questioning in its tracks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While the yes opens up that vast moral </v>

82
00:04:11.141 --> 00:04:11.974
<v Speaker 1>web in which we are forced to consider </v>
<v Speaker 1>the needs and desires of others forced </v>

83
00:04:14.951 --> 00:04:15.784
<v Speaker 1>to confront and workout are messy </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility in relation to everyone </v>

84
00:04:19.451 --> 00:04:21.250
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Still the fact is,</v>

85
00:04:21.251 --> 00:04:22.084
<v Speaker 1>given the truth that almost everyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't give that there are a good </v>

86
00:04:25.691 --> 00:04:30.691
<v Speaker 1>number of people like me that decided </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they should but don't.</v>

87
00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.560
<v Speaker 1>I think this tension,</v>
<v Speaker 1>insights of valuable pain in our hearts,</v>

88
00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.710
<v Speaker 1>but I have to wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it valuable enough?</v>

89
00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.823
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>
