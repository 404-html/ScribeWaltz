1
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:15.390
<v Speaker 1>There's no painting in the history of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the forum,</v>

2
00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:20.420
<v Speaker 1>more worthy of analysis then Diego </v>
<v Speaker 1>Velasquez,</v>

3
00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:21.693
<v Speaker 1>Las Meninas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we're talking about here is a </v>

4
00:00:23.801 --> 00:00:27.010
<v Speaker 1>master work by an artist late in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

5
00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.330
<v Speaker 1>but at the height of his powers </v>
<v Speaker 1>determined to drive into this canvas,</v>

6
00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:35.860
<v Speaker 1>the sum total of his talent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his experience and his intellect.</v>

7
00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.120
<v Speaker 1>Velasquez had been by then a court </v>
<v Speaker 1>painter for the Spanish King Phillip,</v>

8
00:00:40.121 --> 00:00:42.990
<v Speaker 1>the fourth for over 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>

9
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.990
<v Speaker 1>he was a favorite of Philips painting </v>
<v Speaker 1>his portrait many times and advancing in</v>

10
00:00:46.991 --> 00:00:50.680
<v Speaker 1>salary and rank all the way up to </v>
<v Speaker 1>chamberlain of the palace,</v>

11
00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:51.693
<v Speaker 1>responsible for decorating this great </v>
<v Speaker 1>Alcazar of Madrid with all its many </v>

12
00:00:55.391 --> 00:00:56.224
<v Speaker 1>artworks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's no surprise that for his </v>

13
00:00:57.881 --> 00:00:58.714
<v Speaker 1>masterpiece,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Velasquez sets his painting in the </v>

14
00:01:00.911 --> 00:01:03.400
<v Speaker 1>palace itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the place he knew best,</v>

15
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.473
<v Speaker 1>specifically in his own studio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>adorned with paintings that he himself </v>

16
00:01:07.961 --> 00:01:10.270
<v Speaker 1>chose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now they're a little bit hard to see,</v>

17
00:01:10.271 --> 00:01:11.104
<v Speaker 1>but we know what they are based on </v>
<v Speaker 1>histories of the space and it's no </v>

18
00:01:14.111 --> 00:01:17.560
<v Speaker 1>accident that he chooses these paintings</v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically,</v>

19
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.120
<v Speaker 1>but we'll get to that a bit later.</v>

20
00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.313
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's take a look at the main action of </v>

21
00:01:21.911 --> 00:01:24.820
<v Speaker 1>the scene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So much hits you right away.</v>

22
00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.790
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the first thing you see is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>little girl,</v>

23
00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.480
<v Speaker 1>Margaret Teresa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then only living child of the king,</v>

24
00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:32.583
<v Speaker 1>or maybe you see that mirror showing </v>
<v Speaker 1>reflected images of the king and queen </v>

25
00:01:35.771 --> 00:01:38.530
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe the first thing that stands out</v>

26
00:01:38.531 --> 00:01:39.364
<v Speaker 1>to you is that six of the nine </v>
<v Speaker 1>characters represented here are staring </v>

27
00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.043
<v Speaker 1>beyond the picture plane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to say at you that fact alone </v>

28
00:01:48.131 --> 00:01:51.760
<v Speaker 1>gives this image.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's great sense of spontaneity as if it</v>

29
00:01:51.761 --> 00:01:52.594
<v Speaker 1>were Snapshot Velasquez captures the </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment just when several of these </v>

30
00:01:56.651 --> 00:02:01.330
<v Speaker 1>figures are noticing something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some like these three have yet to notice</v>

31
00:02:01.331 --> 00:02:02.950
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the case of the little princess,</v>

32
00:02:02.951 --> 00:02:03.784
<v Speaker 1>all that's moved so far is her eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but though the moment depicted is </v>

33
00:02:08.171 --> 00:02:09.004
<v Speaker 1>spontaneous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the composition of the subjects is </v>

34
00:02:11.771 --> 00:02:12.604
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have here a real clinic in </v>

35
00:02:14.771 --> 00:02:16.750
<v Speaker 1>composing group scenes.</v>

36
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.420
<v Speaker 1>What Velasquez has done in this group of</v>
<v Speaker 1>11,</v>

37
00:02:19.421 --> 00:02:21.520
<v Speaker 1>including the mirror images of the king </v>
<v Speaker 1>queen.</v>

38
00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:22.693
<v Speaker 1>This arranged an extraordinary number of</v>
<v Speaker 1>links and contrasts that slides your </v>

39
00:02:27.641 --> 00:02:31.750
<v Speaker 1>eyes back and forth across the canvas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first thing to notice perhaps is the</v>

40
00:02:31.751 --> 00:02:35.290
<v Speaker 1>obsession here with grouping twos and </v>
<v Speaker 1>threes,</v>

41
00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:36.573
<v Speaker 1>everyone here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the princess can be split into </v>

42
00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:39.423
<v Speaker 1>pairs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The male and female dwarf the two </v>

43
00:02:41.951 --> 00:02:42.784
<v Speaker 1>chaperones here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the curtsying made and the palace </v>

44
00:02:45.461 --> 00:02:49.120
<v Speaker 1>official in the back corridor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the king and the queen in the mirror and</v>

45
00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.570
<v Speaker 1>Velasquez and the maid kneeling to offer</v>
<v Speaker 1>the princess a drink.</v>

46
00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:53.763
<v Speaker 1>Notice also that these are all male </v>
<v Speaker 1>female pairs and these pairings </v>

47
00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.940
<v Speaker 1>accentuate the princess as the focus of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the scene,</v>

48
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.180
<v Speaker 1>but you could also split the group up </v>
<v Speaker 1>into threes.</v>

49
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.540
<v Speaker 1>The princess with her two maids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that dog and the two dwarves and the two</v>

50
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.300
<v Speaker 1>palace officials with what now occurs to</v>
<v Speaker 1>us are mirrored couples,</v>

51
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.393
<v Speaker 1>so you also that these two groups of </v>
<v Speaker 1>three internally made up of doubles and </v>

52
00:03:18.551 --> 00:03:21.760
<v Speaker 1>triples are all on the same horizontal </v>
<v Speaker 1>plane.</v>

53
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.073
<v Speaker 1>This group of six also draws the </v>
<v Speaker 1>entirety of the paintings three </v>

54
00:03:26.171 --> 00:03:27.004
<v Speaker 1>dimensional space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our eye is drawn from Velasquez and the </v>

55
00:03:29.951 --> 00:03:30.784
<v Speaker 1>foreground to the palace official and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the distance as they're wearing similar </v>

56
00:03:33.911 --> 00:03:37.300
<v Speaker 1>black garb and stand in line with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>two doorways on the back walls.</v>

57
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:38.583
<v Speaker 1>The chaperones in the middle ground </v>
<v Speaker 1>linked to the king and Queen in the </v>

58
00:03:40.781 --> 00:03:41.614
<v Speaker 1>background,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which simultaneously brings the z axis </v>

59
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.080
<v Speaker 1>all the way forward beyond the picture </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself,</v>

60
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.110
<v Speaker 1>intimating a depth that we can't even </v>
<v Speaker 1>see.</v>

61
00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.810
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you might not have realized is that</v>

62
00:03:52.811 --> 00:03:53.644
<v Speaker 1>this motif of twos and threes has </v>
<v Speaker 1>already been established in the frames </v>

63
00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:58.053
<v Speaker 1>on the back wall with two giant canvases</v>
<v Speaker 1>overtop to doorframes and the central </v>

64
00:04:02.801 --> 00:04:03.634
<v Speaker 1>mirror of that bottom triple the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>sides of the frames correspond with the </v>

65
00:04:07.391 --> 00:04:08.224
<v Speaker 1>princess and her two maids moving the </v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes naturally from the king and queen </v>

66
00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:13.323
<v Speaker 1>to their daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the eyes are also drawn from the </v>

67
00:04:15.881 --> 00:04:17.650
<v Speaker 1>mirror to the right.</v>

68
00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.890
<v Speaker 1>That lighted passage framing the palace </v>
<v Speaker 1>official.</v>

69
00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:22.083
<v Speaker 1>The space of this light and rectangle is</v>
<v Speaker 1>equal to that of the mirror and they're </v>

70
00:04:25.301 --> 00:04:27.610
<v Speaker 1>put on the same horizontal plane as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

71
00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.350
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of its brightness,</v>

72
00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.890
<v Speaker 1>like the brightness of the little </v>
<v Speaker 1>princess bathed in light,</v>

73
00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.560
<v Speaker 1>we're drawn to it just as much as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other two.</v>

74
00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:41.250
<v Speaker 1>In these three elements of Las Meninas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have three central focus points.</v>

75
00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.500
<v Speaker 1>Unlike da Vinci's last supper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

76
00:04:44.501 --> 00:04:48.040
<v Speaker 1>were all elements in the painting point </v>
<v Speaker 1>toward Jesus Christ.</v>

77
00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.903
<v Speaker 1>Las Meninas is more ambiguous letting </v>
<v Speaker 1>the viewer vacillate between multiple </v>

78
00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:54.243
<v Speaker 1>centers of weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Being a court painter for the royal </v>

79
00:04:56.261 --> 00:04:58.900
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's obvious why Velasquez would want to</v>

80
00:04:58.901 --> 00:05:01.570
<v Speaker 1>highlight the royal couple and their </v>
<v Speaker 1>daughter,</v>

81
00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.020
<v Speaker 1>but what's significant about the back </v>
<v Speaker 1>hallway?</v>

82
00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:07.810
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this gets it a long running debate about</v>

83
00:05:07.811 --> 00:05:12.811
<v Speaker 1>the significance of this mirror.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What exactly is it reflecting?</v>

84
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:15.333
<v Speaker 1>A number of critics have seen it as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reflection of the actual king and queen </v>

85
00:05:18.221 --> 00:05:19.420
<v Speaker 1>standing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we said,</v>

86
00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:20.283
<v Speaker 1>beyond the picture plane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>putting the viewer literally in the </v>

87
00:05:22.781 --> 00:05:23.614
<v Speaker 1>shoes of royalty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a closer examination of the one </v>

88
00:05:27.071 --> 00:05:31.210
<v Speaker 1>point perspective of this image reveals </v>
<v Speaker 1>something else.</v>

89
00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:35.140
<v Speaker 1>The vanishing point of Las Meninas is </v>
<v Speaker 1>not here,</v>

90
00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.520
<v Speaker 1>but here in the lighted doorway to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

91
00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:41.350
<v Speaker 1>What does this mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

92
00:05:41.351 --> 00:05:43.510
<v Speaker 1>it means that the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have this painting,</v>

93
00:05:43.511 --> 00:05:45.760
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't opposite the mirror.</v>

94
00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:47.530
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Opposite the door,</v>

95
00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.950
<v Speaker 1>so the mirror doesn't reflect directly </v>
<v Speaker 1>back at us.</v>

96
00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.933
<v Speaker 1>It reflects at an angle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an angle that puts its image on another </v>

97
00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:56.583
<v Speaker 1>unseen aspect of meninas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The canvas that Velasquez is working on </v>

98
00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:02.953
<v Speaker 1>now for a moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's get back to the paintings in the </v>

99
00:06:04.491 --> 00:06:05.324
<v Speaker 1>upper half of this picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are copies of two paintings by </v>

100
00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.690
<v Speaker 1>Peter Paul Rubens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hero of Alaska's,</v>

101
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.120
<v Speaker 1>and they tell similar stories in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>case,</v>

102
00:06:14.121 --> 00:06:17.540
<v Speaker 1>both from ovid's metamorphosis in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

103
00:06:17.541 --> 00:06:18.374
<v Speaker 1>the mortal Marcias challenges the god </v>
<v Speaker 1>Apollo to a flute plane contest in the </v>

104
00:06:22.671 --> 00:06:25.250
<v Speaker 1>Left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Goddess Athena challenges the mortal</v>

105
00:06:25.251 --> 00:06:28.820
<v Speaker 1>Arachni to a weaving contest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

106
00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:34.090
<v Speaker 1>these are two contests between mortals </v>
<v Speaker 1>and God's on the subject of the arts,</v>

107
00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:35.953
<v Speaker 1>Marcias loses and Arachni winds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but both are punished by their gods in </v>

108
00:06:39.861 --> 00:06:40.694
<v Speaker 1>the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for failing to recognize the divine </v>

109
00:06:42.501 --> 00:06:44.810
<v Speaker 1>source of the artistic endeavor.</v>

110
00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:49.760
<v Speaker 1>Such stories are extremely relevant to </v>
<v Speaker 1>las meninas because in the end,</v>

111
00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:52.850
<v Speaker 1>this is a painting about painting </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

112
00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:56.570
<v Speaker 1>In Velasquez is time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Painting still didn't hold the same kind</v>

113
00:06:56.571 --> 00:07:01.571
<v Speaker 1>of noble place as poetry and music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Las meninas in all it's splendid effects</v>

114
00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:06.770
<v Speaker 1>is a vigorous argument for the virtue of</v>
<v Speaker 1>painting,</v>

115
00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:12.100
<v Speaker 1>whether it comes from the heavens or </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the lifelong practice of craft,</v>

116
00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:15.890
<v Speaker 1>and this gets at the heart of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mirror.</v>

117
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:19.010
<v Speaker 1>The vanishing point and the multiple </v>
<v Speaker 1>centers of Focus,</v>

118
00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:24.170
<v Speaker 1>see what my art can do for Alaska is </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying to the viewer and to his king and</v>

119
00:07:24.171 --> 00:07:25.004
<v Speaker 1>Queen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look not to nature or your own </v>

120
00:07:27.201 --> 00:07:31.070
<v Speaker 1>reflection in the mirror for the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>marvelous depiction of your image,</v>

121
00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:32.323
<v Speaker 1>but to my canvas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>las meninas is an extraordinary </v>

122
00:07:36.081 --> 00:07:40.640
<v Speaker 1>accomplishment for its time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but its effect is timeless.</v>

123
00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:42.770
<v Speaker 1>It said that King Phillip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fourth,</v>

124
00:07:42.771 --> 00:07:46.580
<v Speaker 1>often came to Alaska as a studio just to</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch him paint.</v>

125
00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:47.983
<v Speaker 1>Somehow I think las meninas animated his</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness as it does mine 360 years </v>

126
00:07:54.261 --> 00:07:55.094
<v Speaker 1>later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indeed to stare at this painting in any </v>

127
00:07:58.341 --> 00:08:02.990
<v Speaker 1>age is to be convinced slowly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gradually,</v>

128
00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:08.620
<v Speaker 1>and then confidently that you are </v>
<v Speaker 1>witnessing the very best this medium has</v>
