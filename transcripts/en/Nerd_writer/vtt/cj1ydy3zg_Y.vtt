00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.290
<v Speaker 1>Coffee on the Tuesday and blog eight.</v>

2
00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.100
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.620
<v Speaker 1>So Halloween was yesterday and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>weekend was a whole lot of fun.</v>

4
00:00:16.621 --> 00:00:18.060
<v Speaker 1>My friends had a lot of cool costumes to</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

5
00:00:18.061 --> 00:00:18.950
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

6
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:19.793
<v Speaker 1>I have friends who put a lot of work </v>
<v Speaker 1>into it because just makes the holiday </v>

7
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.063
<v Speaker 1>fucking awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually going to put these down </v>

8
00:00:23.821 --> 00:00:26.130
<v Speaker 1>because it's a little bit dangerous to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have adamantium near a computer screen.</v>

9
00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.140
<v Speaker 1>So before we get to the main event,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this luggage,</v>

10
00:00:28.141 --> 00:00:30.630
<v Speaker 1>when I mentioned for a moment what I did</v>
<v Speaker 1>last night for actual Halloween,</v>

11
00:00:30.631 --> 00:00:33.000
<v Speaker 1>I actually got the chance to see one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>my heroes last night in concert,</v>

12
00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:35.160
<v Speaker 1>the author Neil Gaiman at the theater </v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

13
00:00:35.161 --> 00:00:36.540
<v Speaker 1>We'll show you haven't read anything by </v>
<v Speaker 1>Neil Gaiman.</v>

14
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.393
<v Speaker 1>Start doing that right now and if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever get the chance to hear him read </v>

15
00:00:39.601 --> 00:00:42.540
<v Speaker 1>live in concert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just buy the ticket.</v>

16
00:00:42.541 --> 00:00:44.250
<v Speaker 1>Don't even think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Performed with his wife,</v>

17
00:00:44.251 --> 00:00:47.760
<v Speaker 1>Amanda Palmer of the Dresden dolls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never was too much interim music,</v>

18
00:00:47.761 --> 00:00:51.720
<v Speaker 1>but to hear her live a was breathtaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After the show,</v>

19
00:00:51.721 --> 00:00:52.554
<v Speaker 1>they came up to sign autographs and by </v>
<v Speaker 1>some weird turn of luck they just </v>

20
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.150
<v Speaker 1>started the line right where we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>standing,</v>

21
00:00:57.151 --> 00:00:57.984
<v Speaker 1>so I got a chance to shake meals hand </v>
<v Speaker 1>and just extend my thanks for </v>

22
00:01:00.751 --> 00:01:01.501
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>

23
00:01:01.501 --> 00:01:03.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any video that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh wait a second.</v>

24
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:05.680
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>

25
00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.250
<v Speaker 1>proof just goes to show how many times I</v>
<v Speaker 1>wear a pair of jeans.</v>

26
00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.143
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's get to the main event of this </v>

27
00:01:10.871 --> 00:01:11.704
<v Speaker 1>blog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which my friends do a web series and </v>

28
00:01:12.341 --> 00:01:15.300
<v Speaker 1>sketch comedy shorts called the Burns </v>
<v Speaker 1>Worth Saturdays,</v>

29
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.320
<v Speaker 1>so in honor of Halloween they did a </v>
<v Speaker 1>short film called Pten.</v>

30
00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.183
<v Speaker 1>Larry go to the haunted hotel and rented</v>
<v Speaker 1>out a room at the beautiful Langham </v>

31
00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.980
<v Speaker 1>Hotel in Pasadena and film there for </v>
<v Speaker 1>about 12 hours.</v>

32
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.973
<v Speaker 1>About a week ago was primarily my </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends Steven's project and I helped </v>

33
00:01:26.831 --> 00:01:27.664
<v Speaker 1>out as much as I could do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to film some behind the scenes </v>

34
00:01:30.161 --> 00:01:30.994
<v Speaker 1>footage that I could put it on this blog</v>
<v Speaker 1>and show you what it's like to make a </v>

35
00:01:33.821 --> 00:01:36.160
<v Speaker 1>film over a full day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Without any further ado,</v>

36
00:01:36.161 --> 00:01:36.994
<v Speaker 1>here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The making of Pete and Larry at the </v>

37
00:01:39.581 --> 00:01:40.940
<v Speaker 1>haunted hotel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are we do?</v>

38
00:01:40.941 --> 00:01:41.774
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing?</v>

39
00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.450
<v Speaker 4>I want it to be static.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

40
00:01:44.451 --> 00:01:48.460
<v Speaker 4>what are you doing right now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nothing.</v>

41
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.460
<v Speaker 4>Get that fucking cocaine that you guys </v>
<v Speaker 4>should both freeze frame,</v>

42
00:01:52.461 --> 00:01:55.190
<v Speaker 4>like not an actual person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you guys are just not moving and I'm</v>

43
00:01:55.191 --> 00:01:55.900
<v Speaker 4>going to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>

44
00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.060
<v Speaker 4>like I kind of punch you out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I finish up my pine tonight.</v>

45
00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.080
<v Speaker 4>I'm just standing there like this and </v>
<v Speaker 4>see if it goes.</v>

46
00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.170
<v Speaker 4>Oh hell Larry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Alright.</v>

47
00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.330
<v Speaker 4>We'll see what they have on the door.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bit looked so sloppy.</v>

48
00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.720
<v Speaker 4>I really think that if it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If we look at the same time,</v>

49
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.960
<v Speaker 4>that's the only way it's gonna work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What seems to be a serious problem?</v>

50
00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.060
<v Speaker 4>You got a major problem was that it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>filthy in here.</v>

51
00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.823
<v Speaker 4>My brother is having a conference,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the keynote speaker at the [inaudible] </v>

52
00:02:33.221 --> 00:02:38.221
<v Speaker 4>conference,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I suggested come in,</v>

53
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.320
<v Speaker 4>come in to me like we're hugging.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They put it in the eight.</v>

54
00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.480
<v Speaker 4>So where are we in the filming of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>movie yet?</v>

55
00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.890
<v Speaker 4>The second set of day I watched,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I watched the dark night again,</v>

56
00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.780
<v Speaker 4>thinking you guys are insane because </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just on a whole nother level.</v>

57
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.430
<v Speaker 4>Even with Heath Ledger,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just a whole nother level of moving</v>

58
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:07.580
<v Speaker 4>from that navigant.</v>

59
00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:08.413
<v Speaker 5>You're saying that you think we're </v>
<v Speaker 5>insane thing that that begins is better </v>

60
00:03:10.281 --> 00:03:11.390
<v Speaker 5>than dark night?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>

61
00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.290
<v Speaker 5>When the truth is found to be lies.</v>

62
00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.760
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's all I got for that.</v>

63
00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:02.570
<v Speaker 4>Woo Woo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

64
00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.280
<v Speaker 4>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Good shots.</v>

65
00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.513
<v Speaker 4>It's just one single family.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot more than covering that's </v>

66
00:04:25.831 --> 00:04:28.480
<v Speaker 4>happening in the shots that the problem </v>
<v Speaker 4>is.</v>

67
00:04:28.481 --> 00:04:30.760
<v Speaker 4>This whole scene just keeps going.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Action.</v>

68
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000
<v Speaker 4>No one look at me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

69
00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:54.250
<v Speaker 4>from what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

70
00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.460
<v Speaker 4>somebody else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

71
00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:19.730
<v Speaker 4>it's too bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

72
00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:27.480
<v Speaker 4>that's something where it's needed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>God.</v>

73
00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:37.020
<v Speaker 4>Larry King of haunted hotel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is what we're filming right now.</v>

74
00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.200
<v Speaker 4>Indeed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Our.</v>

75
00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:43.270
<v Speaker 4>And you just turn your head gear head on</v>
<v Speaker 4>top of mind.</v>

76
00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:51.013
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's fine.</v>

77
00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:52.290
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

78
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.710
<v Speaker 4>That sounds fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yet what's wrong?</v>

79
00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.700
<v Speaker 5>So there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's about 12 hours of film,</v>

80
00:05:56.701 --> 00:05:57.990
<v Speaker 5>a condensed into four minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Check</v>

81
00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.190
<v Speaker 1>for the link of that short film and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rest of the Saturdays in the dubliner.</v>

82
00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:02.033
<v Speaker 1>I also want to say that I'm really proud</v>
<v Speaker 1>of my friend Steven and all my friends </v>

83
00:06:04.521 --> 00:06:05.790
<v Speaker 1>were continuing to make things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

84
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:06.673
<v Speaker 1>they want to do it for a living,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's important that </v>

85
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.450
<v Speaker 1>everybody does that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody makes things,</v>

86
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:12.300
<v Speaker 1>whether it be a comedy short,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a dramatic show,</v>

87
00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:13.250
<v Speaker 1>a painting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a book,</v>

88
00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.010
<v Speaker 1>a song,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nsx sculpture or dance,</v>

89
00:06:15.011 --> 00:06:17.080
<v Speaker 1>a show what as important that no matter </v>
<v Speaker 1>who you are,</v>

90
00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.943
<v Speaker 1>no matter what you do for a living,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you take some time to make </v>

91
00:06:20.061 --> 00:06:22.700
<v Speaker 1>something that has no other purpose </v>
<v Speaker 1>besides itself.</v>

92
00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:23.563
<v Speaker 1>It's important to tell about our souls </v>
<v Speaker 1>so that when people watch the things we </v>

93
00:06:25.701 --> 00:06:28.520
<v Speaker 1>make or read the things we make or </v>
<v Speaker 1>listen to,</v>

94
00:06:28.521 --> 00:06:31.220
<v Speaker 1>the things we make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can know who we are.</v>
