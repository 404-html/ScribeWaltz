1
00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.993
<v Speaker 1>Looking back at the 19th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's possible to say that the extreme </v>

2
00:00:08.631 --> 00:00:09.464
<v Speaker 1>popularity of serial novel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the novel released in installments over </v>

3
00:00:13.761 --> 00:00:17.360
<v Speaker 1>time was inevitable in London,</v>
<v Speaker 1>changing economics.</v>

4
00:00:17.361 --> 00:00:19.850
<v Speaker 1>We're creating the perfect conditions </v>
<v Speaker 1>for this to happen.</v>

5
00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.190
<v Speaker 1>Thousands of people were moving into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>city.</v>

6
00:00:22.191 --> 00:00:25.730
<v Speaker 1>Literacy among the lower and middle </v>
<v Speaker 1>classes was increasing.</v>

7
00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.480
<v Speaker 1>A new printing and distribution </v>
<v Speaker 1>technologies were coming into their own,</v>

8
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:30.373
<v Speaker 1>but the magic that made cereal such a </v>
<v Speaker 1>huge success wasn't only in the </v>

9
00:00:33.831 --> 00:00:34.664
<v Speaker 1>conditions of the times and publisher's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like Chapman and hall knew that it was </v>

10
00:00:38.601 --> 00:00:42.770
<v Speaker 1>also in the genius of upstarts like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>one they chose.</v>

11
00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:43.783
<v Speaker 1>A young writer named Charles Dickens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chapman and whole commission dickens to </v>

12
00:00:46.851 --> 00:00:47.684
<v Speaker 1>write a few sporting stories to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>released with sketches done by the </v>

13
00:00:50.661 --> 00:00:52.010
<v Speaker 1>artists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Richard Seymour.</v>

14
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.200
<v Speaker 1>Altogether.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The project was called the posh,</v>

15
00:00:54.201 --> 00:00:58.070
<v Speaker 1>the papers of the pickwick club or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pickwick papers for sure.</v>

16
00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:59.413
<v Speaker 1>The first part was horrendous failure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Only 400 copies were sold after the </v>

17
00:01:03.801 --> 00:01:06.890
<v Speaker 1>second part seem more committed suicide </v>
<v Speaker 1>and had to be replaced.</v>

18
00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.053
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't until the fifth installment </v>
<v Speaker 1>when Dickins introduced a funny working </v>

19
00:01:11.331 --> 00:01:15.740
<v Speaker 1>class character named Sam dweller that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the project struck gold,</v>

20
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.730
<v Speaker 1>whether it was a massive hit and after </v>
<v Speaker 1>the insistence of the readership,</v>

21
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.833
<v Speaker 1>the character was expanded throughout </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest of the series launching its </v>

22
00:01:23.091 --> 00:01:28.091
<v Speaker 1>sales from 400 to 40,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>for installment thanks to Dickens,</v>

23
00:01:28.971 --> 00:01:30.860
<v Speaker 1>thanks to publishers like Chapman at </v>
<v Speaker 1>hall,</v>

24
00:01:30.861 --> 00:01:34.190
<v Speaker 1>thanks to new printing presses and </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberal education in railways.</v>

25
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.690
<v Speaker 1>The serial novel dominated the world of </v>
<v Speaker 1>literature for the next 60 years,</v>

26
00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.360
<v Speaker 1>and though most novels these days aren't</v>
<v Speaker 1>published,</v>

27
00:01:41.361 --> 00:01:42.194
<v Speaker 1>like the pickwick papers were the genre </v>
<v Speaker 1>of serialization and it is a genre has </v>

28
00:01:46.761 --> 00:01:47.594
<v Speaker 1>proven to be remarkably strong </v>
<v Speaker 1>flourishing and almost every </v>

29
00:01:50.481 --> 00:01:51.314
<v Speaker 1>storytelling medium,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is no accident as Jennifer </v>

30
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.180
<v Speaker 1>Hayward notes in her incredible book </v>
<v Speaker 1>consuming pleasures.</v>

31
00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.930
<v Speaker 1>The cereal is sort of the perfect form </v>
<v Speaker 1>for capitalism.</v>

32
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.850
<v Speaker 1>It captures readers with the promise of </v>
<v Speaker 1>more constantly delaying gratification,</v>

33
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.893
<v Speaker 1>and this makes it very commercially </v>
<v Speaker 1>effective and for the same reasons for </v>

34
00:02:08.931 --> 00:02:11.210
<v Speaker 1>its appeal to mass market.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Consumers,</v>

35
00:02:11.211 --> 00:02:14.540
<v Speaker 1>cereals have been castigated by critics </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the jump.</v>

36
00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:15.403
<v Speaker 1>Before Dickens became a household name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>High Society reviewers raked his work </v>

37
00:02:19.701 --> 00:02:20.534
<v Speaker 1>through the mud and the same kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>treatment has been meted out on every </v>

38
00:02:23.181 --> 00:02:25.970
<v Speaker 1>new incarnation of the CEO,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's comics,</v>

39
00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.760
<v Speaker 1>the serial films of the forties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pulp novels,</v>

40
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.833
<v Speaker 1>soap operas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the endless sequels of Hollywood </v>

41
00:02:32.061 --> 00:02:37.061
<v Speaker 1>blockbusters somewhere in the space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This may be happening right now,</v>

42
00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:41.593
<v Speaker 1>Star Wars olds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think an interesting place in the </v>

43
00:02:43.971 --> 00:02:44.804
<v Speaker 1>history of the cereal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a history that began with dickens and </v>

44
00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:48.423
<v Speaker 1>like Dickens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>George Lucas is a special kind of </v>

45
00:02:51.201 --> 00:02:52.034
<v Speaker 1>visionary going against the grain of </v>
<v Speaker 1>gritty realistic films that dominated </v>

46
00:02:55.311 --> 00:02:56.210
<v Speaker 1>the 19 seventies.</v>

47
00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:57.043
<v Speaker 1>Lucas devised a sweeping space epic with</v>
<v Speaker 1>broad themes influenced by the first </v>

48
00:03:02.681 --> 00:03:05.050
<v Speaker 1>generation of film cereal like Flash </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gordon's,</v>

49
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.310
<v Speaker 1>and he was shrewd enough to understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>the advantages of serialization.</v>

50
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.920
<v Speaker 1>When it came up to doing the contract </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the film.</v>

51
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.040
<v Speaker 1>I knew that what I really had to do was </v>
<v Speaker 1>to protect the unwritten part,</v>

52
00:03:17.561 --> 00:03:18.394
<v Speaker 1>the other two parts of the script.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The truth is that all cereals share a </v>

53
00:03:21.161 --> 00:03:21.994
<v Speaker 1>group of common features and </v>
<v Speaker 1>characteristics going all the way back </v>

54
00:03:24.551 --> 00:03:29.110
<v Speaker 1>to the pickwick papers like Dick and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories in comic book universes and Star</v>

55
00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.943
<v Speaker 1>Wars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cereals tend to feature giant casts of </v>

56
00:03:32.141 --> 00:03:32.974
<v Speaker 1>characters and those characters tend to </v>
<v Speaker 1>resemble the mass public that consumes </v>

57
00:03:36.371 --> 00:03:37.204
<v Speaker 1>them over time and often far too slowly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cereals trend toward diversity and </v>

58
00:03:42.191 --> 00:03:43.024
<v Speaker 1>because of the massive casts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cereals also have lots of subplots and </v>

59
00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.853
<v Speaker 1>the main plots often feature a </v>
<v Speaker 1>surprising reversals and twists and </v>

60
00:03:50.561 --> 00:03:53.860
<v Speaker 1>revelations that keep the audience </v>
<v Speaker 1>reaching for the next installment,</v>

61
00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.993
<v Speaker 1>and this can make for cliche and </v>
<v Speaker 1>hackneyed storytelling like in the case </v>

62
00:03:57.791 --> 00:03:58.624
<v Speaker 1>of soap operas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which reconstructed the form to the </v>

63
00:04:00.551 --> 00:04:03.970
<v Speaker 1>point of delaying all conclusions </v>
<v Speaker 1>infinitely,</v>

64
00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:09.630
<v Speaker 1>but even soap operas demonstrate what is</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably the two most important features</v>

65
00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.320
<v Speaker 1>of cereals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the creation of interpretive communities</v>

66
00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:16.590
<v Speaker 1>and their sensitivity to the audience's </v>
<v Speaker 1>desires.</v>

67
00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.963
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the criticism of dickens work </v>
<v Speaker 1>centered around it's addictive quality </v>

68
00:04:21.151 --> 00:04:24.150
<v Speaker 1>that the books took their readers out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyday life,</v>

69
00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:25.493
<v Speaker 1>but the truth was the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cereals created social bonds around the </v>

70
00:04:29.491 --> 00:04:30.324
<v Speaker 1>content in question acting in this case </v>
<v Speaker 1>against the alienating effects of </v>

71
00:04:34.201 --> 00:04:36.240
<v Speaker 1>capitalism and the industrial </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution.</v>

72
00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:37.403
<v Speaker 1>What's more within this space?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even the lower classes had a forum for </v>

73
00:04:41.521 --> 00:04:42.354
<v Speaker 1>engaging in political discourse </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussing what you thought about bleak </v>

74
00:04:45.181 --> 00:04:49.020
<v Speaker 1>house or Oliver twist was a way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>debating social norms.</v>

75
00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.390
<v Speaker 1>When the force awakens came out last </v>
<v Speaker 1>year,</v>

76
00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:52.313
<v Speaker 1>it's emphasis on practical effects and </v>
<v Speaker 1>tactile imagery was as much a result of </v>

77
00:04:56.371 --> 00:05:01.371
<v Speaker 1>the audience's referendum on the prequel</v>
<v Speaker 1>films as the expansion of the Sam Weller</v>

78
00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.930
<v Speaker 1>character was for Dickens and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pickwick papers,</v>

79
00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:05.243
<v Speaker 1>but this relaunch of the star wars </v>
<v Speaker 1>cereals strikes me as something new </v>

80
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.833
<v Speaker 1>under the sun like soap operas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's promising to be endless like the </v>

81
00:05:13.681 --> 00:05:14.730
<v Speaker 1>marvel film franchise.</v>

82
00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:16.980
<v Speaker 1>It's promising to be connected and </v>
<v Speaker 1>intertwined,</v>

83
00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:18.263
<v Speaker 1>but unlike most of the comic film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so many of the stories and characters </v>

84
00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:22.013
<v Speaker 1>have yet to be written and it's going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be the first film cereal in which </v>

85
00:05:24.661 --> 00:05:25.494
<v Speaker 1>subplots are going to be told as </v>
<v Speaker 1>dedicated features in their own run in </v>

86
00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:33.120
<v Speaker 1>the anthology series.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means opportunity for audiences.</v>

87
00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:34.223
<v Speaker 1>The so called new golden age of TV is </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost exclusively down to serialized </v>

88
00:05:38.181 --> 00:05:41.850
<v Speaker 1>shows that up their game because that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>what audiences demanded.</v>

89
00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:43.253
<v Speaker 1>The new star wars franchise is primed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>explode in a thousand directions and </v>

90
00:05:46.711 --> 00:05:47.544
<v Speaker 1>right now at the beginning is when we </v>
<v Speaker 1>can help to write the rules for what </v>

91
00:05:50.791 --> 00:05:51.624
<v Speaker 1>kind of cereals that we want to see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A new incarnation of serialization is </v>

92
00:05:55.651 --> 00:05:56.484
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fulfill 180 years after the pickwick </v>

93
00:05:58.431 --> 00:06:01.850
<v Speaker 1>papers were first published.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a long history,</v>

94
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.313
<v Speaker 1>so why not mine it for all the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>qualities of this resilient and </v>

95
00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:09.230
<v Speaker 1>receptive Sean.</v>
