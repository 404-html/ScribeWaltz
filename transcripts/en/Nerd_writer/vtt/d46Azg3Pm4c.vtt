1
00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.470
<v Speaker 1>As a filmmaker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christopher Nolan always wants to walk a</v>

2
00:00:23.471 --> 00:00:24.304
<v Speaker 1>fine line if there's one fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 1>theme that suffuses his entire </v>

3
00:00:28.211 --> 00:00:29.044
<v Speaker 1>filmography,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's that cinema as a shared narrative </v>

4
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:33.313
<v Speaker 1>can be a hugely powerful cultural force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm far from the first to notice for </v>

5
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.880
<v Speaker 1>mentioned that many of his films </v>
<v Speaker 1>reference film itself that,</v>

6
00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:43.743
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the inception team bears a strong </v>

7
00:00:45.851 --> 00:00:49.450
<v Speaker 1>resemblance to a film crew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but interestingly though,</v>

8
00:00:49.451 --> 00:00:53.170
<v Speaker 1>a lot of his work could be called Meta </v>
<v Speaker 1>cinematic.</v>

9
00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.513
<v Speaker 1>Nolan is extremely careful about </v>
<v Speaker 1>avoiding medicine amatic images in his </v>

10
00:00:58.361 --> 00:00:59.950
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

11
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.873
<v Speaker 1>in the established Batman Continuity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bruce Wayne and his parents are out to </v>

12
00:01:05.051 --> 00:01:09.490
<v Speaker 1>see the mask of Zorro film before the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fateful double murder.</v>

13
00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.020
<v Speaker 1>That insights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dark nights,</v>

14
00:01:11.021 --> 00:01:13.930
<v Speaker 1>whole saga in Batman begins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

15
00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.823
<v Speaker 1>Nolan's retelling of that origin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Wayne's are out to the opera </v>

16
00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.330
<v Speaker 1>Mephistopheles instead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That change is a purposeful one.</v>

17
00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:23.463
<v Speaker 1>As Nolan has said in an interview,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we didn't have young Bruce Wayne going </v>

18
00:01:26.441 --> 00:01:28.750
<v Speaker 1>to see zero because it character in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>

19
00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:29.583
<v Speaker 1>Watching a movie is very different than </v>
<v Speaker 1>a character in a comic book watching a </v>

20
00:01:32.561 --> 00:01:33.394
<v Speaker 1>movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it creates a deconstructionist thing </v>

21
00:01:35.921 --> 00:01:36.754
<v Speaker 1>that we were trying to avoid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason Nolan tries to avoid this is </v>

22
00:01:40.421 --> 00:01:41.254
<v Speaker 1>because over and above everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his cinema has always been about </v>

23
00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:46.023
<v Speaker 1>immersion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bringing you into a story so fully that </v>

24
00:01:48.821 --> 00:01:53.260
<v Speaker 1>the edges disappear and you're carried </v>
<v Speaker 1>along by the narrative momentum.</v>

25
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.410
<v Speaker 1>This is the line that Nolan wants to </v>
<v Speaker 1>walk.</v>

26
00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.520
<v Speaker 1>He wants to be immersive and medicine </v>
<v Speaker 1>and at the same time,</v>

27
00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.570
<v Speaker 1>in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wants to hide in plain sight.</v>

28
00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:09.870
<v Speaker 1>Hiding in plain sight is essentially the</v>
<v Speaker 1>subject matter of Nolan's fifth film and</v>

29
00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.130
<v Speaker 1>my favorite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the prestige.</v>

30
00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.030
<v Speaker 1>You could almost call this film Meta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meta cinematic,</v>

31
00:02:16.031 --> 00:02:16.864
<v Speaker 1>and that it functions as a kind of rule </v>
<v Speaker 1>book for how to achieve this immersive </v>

32
00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.990
<v Speaker 1>effect without seeming </v>
<v Speaker 1>deconstructionist.</v>

33
00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.440
<v Speaker 1>To use Nolan's words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just take the first sequence.</v>

34
00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:27.573
<v Speaker 1>The first thing you see is the film </v>
<v Speaker 1>title over a mysterious shot of several </v>

35
00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.300
<v Speaker 1>mislaid top hats in the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The text here is,</v>

36
00:02:34.301 --> 00:02:37.690
<v Speaker 1>of course the title card,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you know the film,</v>

37
00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:38.583
<v Speaker 1>you know that this text also has a </v>
<v Speaker 1>literal function because these hats are </v>

38
00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:43.323
<v Speaker 1>the prestige of the prestige itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second clue is in their number </v>

39
00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:50.440
<v Speaker 1>doubles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>copies,</v>

40
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.860
<v Speaker 1>multiplicity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the key to understanding the tricks</v>

41
00:02:53.861 --> 00:02:57.310
<v Speaker 1>of this film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is echoed in the second shot as</v>

42
00:02:57.311 --> 00:03:01.960
<v Speaker 1>well with bird cages of identical </v>
<v Speaker 1>canaries from here,</v>

43
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.830
<v Speaker 1>Michael Caine's character goes onto </v>
<v Speaker 1>describe how a magic trick works.</v>

44
00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.800
<v Speaker 1>It'd be magic trick consists of three </v>
<v Speaker 1>poles,</v>

45
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.140
<v Speaker 1>the pledge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the turn,</v>

46
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.190
<v Speaker 1>and finally the prestige.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The sequence carefully sets up the films</v>

47
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.083
<v Speaker 1>own pledges that is borden and Angie are</v>
<v Speaker 1>played by Christian Bale and Hugh </v>

48
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.983
<v Speaker 1>Jackman respectively while illustrating </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's method through Michael Caine's </v>

49
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.510
<v Speaker 1>voiceover and his trick for the little </v>
<v Speaker 1>girl,</v>

50
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.620
<v Speaker 1>but the film is playing its own tricks </v>
<v Speaker 1>here through editing.</v>

51
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.750
<v Speaker 1>Where is this voiceover coming from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usually in film a voiceover mean someone</v>

52
00:03:34.751 --> 00:03:39.040
<v Speaker 1>commenting on the events being shown </v>
<v Speaker 1>from sometime in the future and when the</v>

53
00:03:39.041 --> 00:03:39.874
<v Speaker 1>scene ends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it cuts to the courtroom scene of </v>

54
00:03:41.411 --> 00:03:44.290
<v Speaker 1>borden's murder trial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Picking up the last phrase,</v>

55
00:03:44.291 --> 00:03:47.770
<v Speaker 1>as if Michael Caine's whole explanation </v>
<v Speaker 1>was testimony.</v>

56
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.120
<v Speaker 1>It's not until the very end of the film </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we learned that the bird trick with</v>

57
00:03:52.121 --> 00:03:55.690
<v Speaker 1>the girl is chronologically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The last moment in the film,</v>

58
00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:56.553
<v Speaker 1>Nolan reverses the temporal relationship</v>
<v Speaker 1>between the voiceover and the scene </v>

59
00:04:00.371 --> 00:04:03.580
<v Speaker 1>under it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this kind of displacement is the key</v>

60
00:04:03.581 --> 00:04:04.414
<v Speaker 1>mechanism for the whole movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Prestige is all about a trick that </v>

61
00:04:08.441 --> 00:04:12.130
<v Speaker 1>moves its object through time and space </v>
<v Speaker 1>instantaneously.</v>

62
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:13.203
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is exactly what all film editing </v>

63
00:04:15.311 --> 00:04:16.144
<v Speaker 1>does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of editing cuts between short </v>

64
00:04:17.951 --> 00:04:18.784
<v Speaker 1>distances and continuous times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indeed with a simple cut that's what </v>

65
00:04:22.031 --> 00:04:24.520
<v Speaker 1>most people expect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that seems simple.</v>

66
00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.353
<v Speaker 1>Cut can traverse great distances also </v>
<v Speaker 1>and great lengths of time in either </v>

67
00:04:29.471 --> 00:04:30.304
<v Speaker 1>direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nolan has described learning the power </v>

68
00:04:32.591 --> 00:04:37.030
<v Speaker 1>of this by watching terrence Malik's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thin red line in which Malik cuts to</v>

69
00:04:37.031 --> 00:04:41.380
<v Speaker 1>memories simply without blurs or fades </v>
<v Speaker 1>or wavy lines,</v>

70
00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.320
<v Speaker 1>and the powerful effect this can have on</v>
<v Speaker 1>a viewer.</v>

71
00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:45.603
<v Speaker 1>The Prestige exploits this power to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>extreme cutting between multiple </v>

72
00:04:49.001 --> 00:04:53.210
<v Speaker 1>different nested memories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nolan sets up this device with board and</v>

73
00:04:53.211 --> 00:04:57.370
<v Speaker 1>an engineer's respective journals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but once these devices are established,</v>

74
00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.760
<v Speaker 1>he cuts between the narratives at will </v>
<v Speaker 1>and without warning.</v>

75
00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:01.653
<v Speaker 1>In this way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the prestige demonstrates a unique </v>

76
00:05:03.611 --> 00:05:08.110
<v Speaker 1>capacity of film without compromising </v>
<v Speaker 1>the audience's suspended disbelief.</v>

77
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:09.273
<v Speaker 1>The complex narrative structure is </v>
<v Speaker 1>totally subservient to the story Nolan </v>

78
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.520
<v Speaker 1>wants to tell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's necessary to keep its twists secret</v>

79
00:05:15.521 --> 00:05:16.354
<v Speaker 1>until the film wants to reveal them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is Christopher Nolan's great gift </v>

80
00:05:19.661 --> 00:05:23.800
<v Speaker 1>as a filmmaker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's so intune with the dynamics of film</v>

81
00:05:23.801 --> 00:05:27.280
<v Speaker 1>narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he can construct a plot with so much</v>

82
00:05:27.281 --> 00:05:31.300
<v Speaker 1>forward momentum that even when he gives</v>
<v Speaker 1>you all the clues,</v>

83
00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.080
<v Speaker 1>you remain at his mercy until the very </v>
<v Speaker 1>final shot.</v>

84
00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:37.463
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if this was the only lesson of the </v>

85
00:05:38.491 --> 00:05:39.324
<v Speaker 1>prestige,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be satisfied and calling it a great </v>

86
00:05:41.041 --> 00:05:44.160
<v Speaker 1>film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's one scene here easily missed</v>

87
00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.830
<v Speaker 1>that adds a final important point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

88
00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:03.950
<v Speaker 1>it's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can watch the prestige and enjoy the</v>

89
00:06:06.771 --> 00:06:10.070
<v Speaker 1>story for what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what Nolan wants for us.</v>

90
00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:13.220
<v Speaker 1>He wants us to be amazed and as the film</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself says,</v>

91
00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:17.270
<v Speaker 1>most of us want to be fooled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all films,</v>

92
00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:22.370
<v Speaker 1>even one as tightly wellmed as this </v>
<v Speaker 1>invite a probing.</v>

93
00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:23.213
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the boy sees into the bird trick we </v>

94
00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:31.930
<v Speaker 1>can see into cinema and we're accustomed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to taking most editing for granted,</v>

95
00:06:31.941 --> 00:06:32.774
<v Speaker 1>but the way stories are told,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tools of any storytelling medium in </v>

96
00:06:36.321 --> 00:06:40.730
<v Speaker 1>large part determined the way we </v>
<v Speaker 1>construct our own memories,</v>

97
00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:41.743
<v Speaker 1>shared or personal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is all to say that studying film </v>

98
00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:50.300
<v Speaker 1>doesn't kill it's magic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It feeds that magic back</v>

99
00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:53.390
<v Speaker 2>into the real world.</v>

100
