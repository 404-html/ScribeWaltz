00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.060
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to a New Year of coffee on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tuesday and it's going to show.</v>

2
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:06.630
<v Speaker 1>This is going to be late.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>

3
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:07.823
<v Speaker 1>45.</v>

4
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.010
<v Speaker 1>So I have a reason why the Vlog is late </v>
<v Speaker 1>this week.</v>

5
00:00:22.011 --> 00:00:25.220
<v Speaker 1>And that reason is of course Downton </v>
<v Speaker 1>Abbey.</v>

6
00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.750
<v Speaker 1>I thought I would just see what the fuss</v>
<v Speaker 1>was about this thing.</v>

7
00:00:29.751 --> 00:00:30.584
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just put on one episode that was going </v>

8
00:00:31.861 --> 00:00:34.970
<v Speaker 1>to be it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you didn't have to marry him,</v>

9
00:00:34.971 --> 00:00:36.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then months ago,</v>

10
00:00:36.471 --> 00:00:39.190
<v Speaker 1>before I left theater said we needed a </v>
<v Speaker 1>rat poison and I bought.</v>

11
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.150
<v Speaker 1>And then what am I sitting in a swivel </v>
<v Speaker 1>chair?</v>

12
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.550
<v Speaker 1>So I lost track of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

13
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.690
<v Speaker 1>The Crawley's watching the show episode </v>
<v Speaker 1>by episode though dangerous to my day to</v>

14
00:00:53.691 --> 00:00:56.330
<v Speaker 1>day responsibilities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gave me a sense of the shows,</v>

15
00:00:56.331 --> 00:00:59.480
<v Speaker 1>broader narrative for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The show seems to follow this pattern,</v>

16
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:00.770
<v Speaker 1>desire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>desire,</v>

17
00:01:00.771 --> 00:01:03.470
<v Speaker 1>desire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>giving into that desire.</v>

18
00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:04.453
<v Speaker 1>Then dealing with the consequences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>negative or positive from getting into </v>

19
00:01:07.011 --> 00:01:10.100
<v Speaker 1>that desire and then starting the </v>
<v Speaker 1>process all over again with a new set of</v>

20
00:01:10.101 --> 00:01:10.850
<v Speaker 1>initial condition.</v>

21
00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.520
<v Speaker 1>Is this what our lives are really like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>After all,</v>

22
00:01:13.521 --> 00:01:14.354
<v Speaker 1>we are creatures of desire each day </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're pushed and pulled by once by her </v>

23
00:01:17.621 --> 00:01:20.060
<v Speaker 1>desire for things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for status,</v>

24
00:01:20.061 --> 00:01:22.280
<v Speaker 1>for people for pleasure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>small pleasures,</v>

25
00:01:22.281 --> 00:01:24.410
<v Speaker 1>feelings of pleasure are the easiest to </v>
<v Speaker 1>obtain.</v>

26
00:01:24.411 --> 00:01:25.244
<v Speaker 1>It's why we drink coffee or alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's why we do drugs or lose ourselves </v>

27
00:01:28.461 --> 00:01:30.540
<v Speaker 1>and upstairs downstairs British drama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Smith,</v>

28
00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:31.573
<v Speaker 1>our desires for a more sustained </v>
<v Speaker 1>pleasure for status or knowledge take </v>

29
00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:35.803
<v Speaker 1>time to achieve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We stave off the fulfillment of more </v>

30
00:01:38.061 --> 00:01:39.680
<v Speaker 1>immediate pleasures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we can,</v>

31
00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.260
<v Speaker 1>to work for something great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these greater desires,</v>

32
00:01:42.261 --> 00:01:44.450
<v Speaker 1>we often seek to justify it to other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

33
00:01:44.451 --> 00:01:49.370
<v Speaker 1>We tell them about our plants in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>process which may take months or years.</v>

34
00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.550
<v Speaker 1>We're learning and growing all the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>and our desires often change.</v>

35
00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.920
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes we realize that we don't want </v>
<v Speaker 1>what we originally set out to achieve.</v>

36
00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:59.203
<v Speaker 1>We want something new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all the time and energy we put into </v>

37
00:02:01.251 --> 00:02:02.084
<v Speaker 1>our now defunct desires and all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people we've told about them and the </v>

38
00:02:04.911 --> 00:02:05.744
<v Speaker 1>desire itself repeated so many times </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's entangled in our </v>

39
00:02:08.601 --> 00:02:11.570
<v Speaker 1>personalities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes any change very hard.</v>

40
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.360
<v Speaker 1>Here we are at the first step of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Downton Abbey formula.</v>

41
00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.590
<v Speaker 1>Subversive desire begins to grow within </v>
<v Speaker 1>our already organized,</v>

42
00:02:18.591 --> 00:02:20.810
<v Speaker 1>like organized by ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by others,</v>

43
00:02:20.811 --> 00:02:24.170
<v Speaker 1>by our social class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>until the pressure becomes too great and</v>

44
00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.063
<v Speaker 1>we give in and opened the door to both </v>
<v Speaker 1>our desire and the consequences that </v>

45
00:02:28.431 --> 00:02:31.310
<v Speaker 1>come from action sometimes actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost all the time.</v>

46
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.040
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>giving into new desires is a gamble.</v>

47
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.050
<v Speaker 1>We're gambling what we have for what we </v>
<v Speaker 1>want and we may come out a loser on both</v>

48
00:02:39.051 --> 00:02:39.884
<v Speaker 1>counts down nabby shows us that the risk</v>
<v Speaker 1>for those with means is not nearly as </v>

49
00:02:43.281 --> 00:02:44.114
<v Speaker 1>great as it is for those without though </v>
<v Speaker 1>neither can seem to resist giving in at </v>

50
00:02:48.771 --> 00:02:49.604
<v Speaker 1>least once in a while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both the upper and lower classes in our </v>

51
00:02:51.531 --> 00:02:52.364
<v Speaker 1>case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the great middleclass must face the </v>

52
00:02:54.141 --> 00:02:59.141
<v Speaker 1>truly absurd truth that our short lives </v>
<v Speaker 1>are constrained by arbitrary rules,</v>

53
00:02:59.471 --> 00:03:04.471
<v Speaker 1>rules we ourselves made up and agreed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>many of our best desires go unfulfilled.</v>

54
00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.863
<v Speaker 1>The desires made to expand us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to open us the desire to live unimpeded </v>

55
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.240
<v Speaker 1>in a world of impediments well that sad </v>
<v Speaker 1>to think about.</v>

56
00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.540
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I can cheer myself up with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first episode of</v>

57
00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:22.123
<v Speaker 2>breaking bad.</v>
