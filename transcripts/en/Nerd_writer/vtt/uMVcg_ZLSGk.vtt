<v Speaker 1>Hello and welcome to my second video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This has been pushed back and I'm a </v>

2
00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:08.180
<v Speaker 1>blogger now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason I'm doing another one,</v>

3
00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.350
<v Speaker 1>actually it's because I had an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's my thinking.</v>

4
00:00:17.351 --> 00:00:21.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm a nerdfighter and a writer under </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting writer,</v>

5
00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.010
<v Speaker 1>a nerd writer watch.</v>

6
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:27.853
<v Speaker 1>That's almost a w.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I am going to answer the Youtube </v>

7
00:00:29.511 --> 00:00:30.344
<v Speaker 1>survey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but first I wanted to say </v>

8
00:00:31.311 --> 00:00:33.860
<v Speaker 1>congratulations to Maureen Johnson and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the name of the star.</v>

9
00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.170
<v Speaker 1>It's fantastic to get published.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Regulations.</v>

10
00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.940
<v Speaker 1>Boring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to find your book and buy it.</v>

11
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.500
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my first kiss was in a tree house when I</v>

12
00:00:39.501 --> 00:00:41.270
<v Speaker 1>was nine years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was playing truth or dare with a bunch</v>

13
00:00:41.271 --> 00:00:42.104
<v Speaker 1>of people and someone dared,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a girl named Erica to kiss me and she </v>

14
00:00:44.361 --> 00:00:47.360
<v Speaker 1>did and that was my first kiss and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't fucking believe it.</v>

15
00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:48.440
<v Speaker 1>Casual clothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

16
00:00:48.441 --> 00:00:51.440
<v Speaker 1>Everything I wear is pretty casual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get most of it from the gap,</v>

17
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.020
<v Speaker 1>so probably $60,</v>
<v Speaker 1>99.</v>

18
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.320
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know what I wanted to be when I</v>

19
00:00:54.321 --> 00:00:55.154
<v Speaker 1>was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was always told that it would be an </v>

20
00:00:55.641 --> 00:00:56.690
<v Speaker 1>engineer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like my dad.</v>

21
00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.880
<v Speaker 1>I was always good at science and math,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I never liked him.</v>

22
00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:59.713
<v Speaker 1>I liked history and literature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eventually I decided I wanted to be a </v>

23
00:01:01.791 --> 00:01:03.740
<v Speaker 1>filmmaker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By that time I was already 17 years old.</v>

24
00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:04.603
<v Speaker 1>Does that count?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really glad you asked about school </v>

25
00:01:05.361 --> 00:01:07.190
<v Speaker 1>friends because these are the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>important people in my life.</v>

26
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm a writer so I really could be </v>
<v Speaker 1>anywhere in the world,</v>

27
00:01:08.991 --> 00:01:11.840
<v Speaker 1>but I choose to be in Los Angeles </v>
<v Speaker 1>because my friends are here.</v>

28
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.853
<v Speaker 1>That's the reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the only thing in my life that I </v>

29
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.013
<v Speaker 1>built that I think is worth preserving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Friendship is certainly something that </v>

30
00:01:17.601 --> 00:01:19.250
<v Speaker 1>you built over time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's work.</v>

31
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.200
<v Speaker 1>I love these guys and girls and if they </v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't Siberia,</v>

32
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.360
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beat by the girl George.</v>

33
00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.840
<v Speaker 1>If I had a guy orpheus that will always </v>
<v Speaker 1>push and push,</v>

34
00:01:26.841 --> 00:01:30.140
<v Speaker 1>that would be a good name to zillow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>500 to answer the survey next,</v>

35
00:01:30.141 --> 00:01:33.050
<v Speaker 1>but he's my only subscribers so far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love Ucla.</v>

36
00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:34.130
<v Speaker 1>Thank you so much.</v>
