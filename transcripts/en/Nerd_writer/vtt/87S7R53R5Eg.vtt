1
00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:02.310
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoever put me on reddit out there,</v>

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:03.593
<v Speaker 1>you know I got a bone to pick with you </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the plan was to get subscribers at </v>

3
00:00:07.711 --> 00:00:10.710
<v Speaker 1>a torturously slow incremental,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right over a period of decades.</v>

4
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.240
<v Speaker 1>That was the plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

5
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:15.390
<v Speaker 1>some people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what all I can say to you,</v>

6
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.660
<v Speaker 1>it's coffee on a Tuesday and Vlog 42,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's a feeling I sometimes get.</v>

7
00:00:30.511 --> 00:00:32.310
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you get it to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That happens.</v>

8
00:00:32.311 --> 00:00:35.430
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I come around a corner and all of a</v>

9
00:00:35.431 --> 00:00:36.264
<v Speaker 1>sudden I'm confronted by a sunset or at </v>
<v Speaker 1>that moment in a movie when everything </v>

10
00:00:39.661 --> 00:00:40.494
<v Speaker 1>just falls into place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hairs stand up on the back of my neck </v>

11
00:00:42.901 --> 00:00:44.720
<v Speaker 1>and it chill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>runs down my shoulders,</v>

12
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.280
<v Speaker 1>times it freezes me in place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blanks my mind,</v>

13
00:00:47.281 --> 00:00:49.650
<v Speaker 1>and the feeling I have is one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>astonishment.</v>

14
00:00:49.651 --> 00:00:52.020
<v Speaker 1>And Jimmy Stewart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my favorite actor,</v>

15
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.100
<v Speaker 1>describes it like this.</v>

16
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.220
<v Speaker 2>Creating moments in movies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This I think is the important thing.</v>

17
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.560
<v Speaker 2>Nobody knows exactly how it happened.</v>

18
00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.550
<v Speaker 1>Turns out there's a name for this </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling.</v>

19
00:01:06.551 --> 00:01:10.180
<v Speaker 1>It's called freezer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a French word for cold chill,</v>

20
00:01:10.181 --> 00:01:12.490
<v Speaker 1>but really there is no English </v>
<v Speaker 1>equivalent in French.</v>

21
00:01:12.491 --> 00:01:14.260
<v Speaker 1>It's pronounced like this free zone.</v>

22
00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.460
<v Speaker 1>You can have free song with a person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone you're attracted to,</v>

23
00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:22.323
<v Speaker 1>and if I had to guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it probably happens most frequently in </v>

24
00:01:24.131 --> 00:01:25.780
<v Speaker 1>that nervous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>flirtatious,</v>

25
00:01:25.781 --> 00:01:29.860
<v Speaker 1>almost unbearable time before any </v>
<v Speaker 1>feelings are expressed outright.</v>

26
00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:30.723
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so have you ever spent a subway ride or </v>

27
00:01:31.621 --> 00:01:32.454
<v Speaker 1>a bus ride?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sort of on off looking at someone from </v>

28
00:01:33.911 --> 00:01:35.740
<v Speaker 1>across the train,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who is beautiful,</v>

29
00:01:35.741 --> 00:01:38.110
<v Speaker 1>someone who strikes you and who you </v>
<v Speaker 1>stupidly fall in love with,</v>

30
00:01:38.111 --> 00:01:40.330
<v Speaker 1>with the 10 minutes it takes to get from</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 Fourth Street to Union Square.</v>

31
00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.193
<v Speaker 1>You look at them as they look away and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can feel their eyes on you as </v>

32
00:01:43.541 --> 00:01:44.374
<v Speaker 1>you look away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you sort of just wait there </v>

33
00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.820
<v Speaker 1>until you think it's safe to know this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I contacted freezing,</v>

34
00:01:48.821 --> 00:01:49.630
<v Speaker 1>freezing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>freezing.</v>

35
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.910
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's just me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever triggers it.</v>

36
00:01:51.911 --> 00:01:55.750
<v Speaker 1>We all get these feelings of freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the most common sources is music.</v>

37
00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:56.613
<v Speaker 1>A study published last year in nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Neuroscience showed that the moment in </v>

38
00:01:59.081 --> 00:02:01.360
<v Speaker 1>your favorite song when you experienced </v>
<v Speaker 1>that chill,</v>

39
00:02:01.361 --> 00:02:02.194
<v Speaker 1>that feeling of free zone coincides with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the release of the neurotransmitter </v>

40
00:02:05.321 --> 00:02:06.154
<v Speaker 1>dopamine into your brain opening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Makes you feel good and it's commonly </v>

41
00:02:08.951 --> 00:02:09.784
<v Speaker 1>released to reinforce or motivate </v>
<v Speaker 1>biologically significant activity like </v>

42
00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:13.713
<v Speaker 1>eating or sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suggesting that for some reason unknown </v>

43
00:02:16.691 --> 00:02:17.524
<v Speaker 1>to us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>music is inextricably linked to our </v>

44
00:02:19.811 --> 00:02:22.360
<v Speaker 1>deepest reward systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's something else.</v>

45
00:02:22.361 --> 00:02:23.194
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also get a feeling of free when </v>

46
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.440
<v Speaker 1>overwhelmed by a sad song.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a chill,</v>

47
00:02:26.441 --> 00:02:27.274
<v Speaker 1>but a kind of consoling David here on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>professor at Ohio State University and </v>

48
00:02:30.851 --> 00:02:33.940
<v Speaker 1>who runs the cognitive and systematic </v>
<v Speaker 1>musicology laboratory.</v>

49
00:02:33.941 --> 00:02:36.190
<v Speaker 1>Awesome name has this to say about Sam</v>

50
00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.550
<v Speaker 3>when a person is in a sad state,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

51
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:40.703
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this hormone called Prolactin is </v>

52
00:02:42.541 --> 00:02:45.960
<v Speaker 3>released and it has a psychological </v>
<v Speaker 3>effect,</v>

53
00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.863
<v Speaker 3>a consoling psychological effect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's as though the music has put them </v>

54
00:02:49.921 --> 00:02:50.754
<v Speaker 3>into a kind of sham state of sadness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the body has responded by releasing </v>

55
00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.160
<v Speaker 3>this hormone called Prolactin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>

56
00:03:00.161 --> 00:03:00.994
<v Speaker 3>it's like mother nature sort of wrapping</v>
<v Speaker 3>our arms around you and consoling you </v>

57
00:03:04.091 --> 00:03:06.780
<v Speaker 3>and saying there are there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything's Okay and you have this kind</v>

58
00:03:06.781 --> 00:03:07.900
<v Speaker 3>of warm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuzzy feeling.</v>

59
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:08.980
<v Speaker 3>Extremely interesting.</v>

60
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.993
<v Speaker 1>But following from that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to pick up on an earlier point </v>

61
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:12.573
<v Speaker 1>biologically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we really don't know why music affects </v>

62
00:03:14.231 --> 00:03:16.810
<v Speaker 1>us so powerfully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>White gives us those feelings of Friesen</v>

63
00:03:16.811 --> 00:03:17.644
<v Speaker 1>or constellation or combination of both,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but psychologically I think that music </v>

64
00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.903
<v Speaker 1>is embedded in each one of us uniquely </v>
<v Speaker 1>strong along our memories in the way </v>

65
00:03:27.281 --> 00:03:29.950
<v Speaker 1>that Christmas lights are strung along a</v>
<v Speaker 1>tree branch.</v>

66
00:03:29.951 --> 00:03:32.860
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>music is the raw or of beauty.</v>

67
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.370
<v Speaker 1>It goes deeper and affects them more </v>
<v Speaker 1>potent emotional response than any other</v>

68
00:03:36.371 --> 00:03:37.750
<v Speaker 1>art form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's why when people ask,</v>

69
00:03:37.751 --> 00:03:38.584
<v Speaker 1>I say that the Beatles or the artists of</v>
<v Speaker 1>any medium that have had the largest </v>

70
00:03:41.861 --> 00:03:43.750
<v Speaker 1>single influence on me on February </v>
<v Speaker 1>fourth,</v>

71
00:03:43.751 --> 00:03:44.584
<v Speaker 1>2008,</v>
<v Speaker 1>NASA transmitted a song for the first </v>

72
00:03:46.871 --> 00:03:47.704
<v Speaker 1>time into deep space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Beatles across the universe in the </v>

73
00:03:50.321 --> 00:03:55.240
<v Speaker 1>direction of the star Polaris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>431 light years from Earth.</v>

74
00:03:55.241 --> 00:03:58.600
<v Speaker 1>It's always been a sad song for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if not for its swelling,</v>

75
00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.750
<v Speaker 1>drifting quality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then because it gets me thinking of John</v>

76
00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:02.583
<v Speaker 1>Lennon and d,</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea of melodies like that dancing </v>

77
00:04:04.121 --> 00:04:04.954
<v Speaker 1>out into a silent and unfeeling universe</v>
<v Speaker 1>gives me such a chill and then such a </v>

78
00:04:09.701 --> 00:04:10.534
<v Speaker 1>warmth that I do have the feeling of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being wrapped in a blanket and I'm </v>

79
00:04:13.721 --> 00:04:17.080
<v Speaker 1>consoled for a moment or a minute of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>humanity.</v>

80
00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.260
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to everybody who's new.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so glad to have you.</v>

81
00:04:24.261 --> 00:04:25.094
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a good example of sort of what </v>

82
00:04:27.291 --> 00:04:29.470
<v Speaker 1>goes on here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The vlog is a is a project of,</v>

83
00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.393
<v Speaker 1>of learning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also of expression of trying to say </v>

84
00:04:31.761 --> 00:04:32.594
<v Speaker 1>something a thoughtfully and precisely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So on my channel page you can find </v>

85
00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:39.800
