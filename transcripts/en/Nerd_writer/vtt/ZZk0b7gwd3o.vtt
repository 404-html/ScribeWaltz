00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:00.923
<v Speaker 1>Hi Everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is Evan pushback and it's my first </v>

2
00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:04.410
<v Speaker 1>video blog.</v>

3
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:16.763
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm gonna have to learn how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>not look at myself in the picture so </v>

4
00:00:18.901 --> 00:00:20.400
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

5
00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:22.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm just drawn to my face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a writer,</v>

6
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.080
<v Speaker 1>a much like John Green of the vlog </v>
<v Speaker 1>brothers.</v>

7
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.520
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am a nerdfighter to,</v>

8
00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:27.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unlike John Green.</v>

9
00:00:27.991 --> 00:00:29.250
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not published.</v>

10
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.920
<v Speaker 1>I did it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just looked at myself in the picture.</v>

11
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.620
<v Speaker 1>I can't help it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do I move my face down to the very,</v>

12
00:00:34.621 --> 00:00:35.454
<v Speaker 1>very corner of the screen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I promise I will try not to look at it </v>

13
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.610
<v Speaker 1>one more time for the rest of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>video.</v>

14
00:00:38.611 --> 00:00:39.444
<v Speaker 1>I know I've been told by people that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>do that when I talk to them on skype or </v>

15
00:00:41.371 --> 00:00:42.204
<v Speaker 1>any other kind of video chat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to figure out what I should </v>

16
00:00:43.771 --> 00:00:44.604
<v Speaker 1>do for my first flog a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had been thinking about a lot of </v>

17
00:00:46.681 --> 00:00:47.514
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I figured a good idea might be to start </v>

18
00:00:48.451 --> 00:00:49.940
<v Speaker 1>with telling me a little about myself a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit.</v>

19
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.920
<v Speaker 1>What I do and the reason that I wanted </v>
<v Speaker 1>to start a blog in the first place.</v>

20
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.240
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my name is Evan Puschak.</v>

21
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.450
<v Speaker 1>That's who?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then Shaq.</v>

22
00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.320
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

23
00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.660
<v Speaker 1>my childhood was tough living in Los </v>
<v Speaker 1>Angeles.</v>

24
00:01:00.661 --> 00:01:01.800
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a writer.</v>

25
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.913
<v Speaker 1>I write novels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I studied film making in Boston for for </v>

26
00:01:05.251 --> 00:01:07.080
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many years now.</v>

27
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't do that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a couple reasons.</v>

28
00:01:08.851 --> 00:01:10.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm not still in the filmmaking </v>
<v Speaker 1>industry.</v>

29
00:01:10.171 --> 00:01:11.880
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still love the art of filmmaking.</v>

30
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.580
<v Speaker 1>A lot of my friends still do it and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>encouraged them to be the best that they</v>

31
00:01:14.581 --> 00:01:15.414
<v Speaker 1>can edit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

32
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.373
<v Speaker 1>and I still love talking about it wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much that I didn't like the business </v>

33
00:01:18.301 --> 00:01:19.680
<v Speaker 1>side of the industry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Electrical say,</v>

34
00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:20.723
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to be a bitch for this many </v>

35
00:01:20.971 --> 00:01:22.710
<v Speaker 1>years getting coffee and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so forth.</v>

36
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:23.461
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's tough.</v>

37
00:01:23.461 --> 00:01:24.840
<v Speaker 1>But I didn't really mind that so much.</v>

38
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.760
<v Speaker 1>What am I did?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was that film making is an art form that</v>

39
00:01:26.761 --> 00:01:30.020
<v Speaker 1>is enmeshed in money and you can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>unmeasured.</v>

40
00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:31.380
<v Speaker 1>Does that measure word?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

41
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.600
<v Speaker 1>What it means is this is if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>really fast,</v>

42
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.210
<v Speaker 1>you can maybe maybe make for short films</v>
<v Speaker 1>a year.</v>

43
00:01:36.211 --> 00:01:37.710
<v Speaker 1>And I'm talking about conception from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

44
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.930
<v Speaker 1>from the writing process onto the final </v>
<v Speaker 1>edit.</v>

45
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.600
<v Speaker 1>You maybe do four a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you're a and you sort of know that</v>

46
00:01:42.601 --> 00:01:44.940
<v Speaker 1>when you have an idea for a project,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a vision inside of your head.</v>

47
00:01:44.941 --> 00:01:48.180
<v Speaker 1>It might be triggered by a song or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>story or buy something that you say,</v>

48
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.280
<v Speaker 1>but it triggers in your head like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>vision,</v>

49
00:01:50.281 --> 00:01:51.114
<v Speaker 1>like a dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the process of filmmaking from </v>

50
00:01:52.531 --> 00:01:55.170
<v Speaker 1>writing to casting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to filming to editing.</v>

51
00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.020
<v Speaker 1>It's all sort of a process of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>degradation of that first idea.</v>

52
00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.940
<v Speaker 1>Now a lot of people like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people would say that it's sort</v>

53
00:01:59.941 --> 00:02:00.774
<v Speaker 1>of a maturation of an idea that happens </v>
<v Speaker 1>in your head to something that is </v>

54
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.550
<v Speaker 1>definitely going to be different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but could,</v>

55
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:06.750
<v Speaker 1>could well be better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

56
00:02:06.751 --> 00:02:07.584
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people like the idea of working</v>
<v Speaker 1>together with a lot of people to make a </v>

57
00:02:09.691 --> 00:02:11.120
<v Speaker 1>project.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

58
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.033
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because cooperation is the thing that </v>

59
00:02:13.621 --> 00:02:15.840
<v Speaker 1>they get into it for now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like cooperation.</v>

60
00:02:15.841 --> 00:02:18.600
<v Speaker 1>Don't get me wrong in my life with my </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends,</v>

61
00:02:18.601 --> 00:02:20.220
<v Speaker 1>with my family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the people that I love.</v>

62
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.960
<v Speaker 1>I am willing to cooperate with them on </v>
<v Speaker 1>act of living on the process of living.</v>

63
00:02:24.961 --> 00:02:25.794
<v Speaker 1>I want you to help me and I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>help you and we're going to get along </v>

64
00:02:27.361 --> 00:02:28.194
<v Speaker 1>together the best we can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to be the best people that </v>

65
00:02:29.311 --> 00:02:31.560
<v Speaker 1>we can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when it comes to my art,</v>

66
00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.030
<v Speaker 1>it's a whole different story.</v>

67
00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.090
<v Speaker 1>I confess to being a fascist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now granted,</v>

68
00:02:36.091 --> 00:02:37.950
<v Speaker 1>I think that don't make it does require </v>
<v Speaker 1>a dictator,</v>

69
00:02:37.951 --> 00:02:40.200
<v Speaker 1>benevolent dictator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I try to be in Neverland dictator.</v>

70
00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.070
<v Speaker 1>It just still wasn't at the level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>control that I needed for art.</v>

71
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.660
<v Speaker 1>You're saying all this at the risk of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sounding pretentious,</v>

72
00:02:45.661 --> 00:02:46.494
<v Speaker 1>but I think that that risk is worth </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking and I also think that potential </v>

73
00:02:48.761 --> 00:02:50.580
<v Speaker 1>is a pretty ugly word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When is that?</v>

74
00:02:50.581 --> 00:02:52.030
<v Speaker 1>I had sort of falling out with </v>
<v Speaker 1>filmmaking.</v>

75
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.913
<v Speaker 1>I left that and over the process of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>few months I sort of reevaluate what I </v>

76
00:02:54.961 --> 00:02:56.700
<v Speaker 1>wanted and I realized that I didn't want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be an artist.</v>

77
00:02:56.701 --> 00:02:57.534
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to create,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but once they're a different art form </v>

78
00:02:59.321 --> 00:03:01.810
<v Speaker 1>that would maybe suit me better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I tried writing first I tried,</v>

79
00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:02.813
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>writing short story and then I tried </v>

80
00:03:03.521 --> 00:03:04.354
<v Speaker 1>writing a novella.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Finally I tried writing a novel just to </v>

81
00:03:06.221 --> 00:03:07.054
<v Speaker 1>see if I had the stamina to put that </v>
<v Speaker 1>many words to paper that I did have the </v>

82
00:03:09.701 --> 00:03:10.534
<v Speaker 1>stamina and that I loved it and also </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it gave me the opportunity to </v>

83
00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.210
<v Speaker 1>cuddle my work and the way that I want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

84
00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:21.210
<v Speaker 1>You can sort of coddle a sentence or </v>
<v Speaker 1>paragraph in the in a way that you can't</v>

85
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.790
<v Speaker 1>with a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a film shot for example.</v>

86
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.010
<v Speaker 1>So there we are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I went to Paris for the summer.</v>

87
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.903
<v Speaker 1>I wrote my first novel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm revising it now and we get to the </v>

88
00:03:30.371 --> 00:03:34.180
<v Speaker 1>reason why I am starting this blog </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm as video editing,</v>

89
00:03:34.181 --> 00:03:37.600
<v Speaker 1>but mostly because I see blogging as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good platform to get my word out there.</v>

90
00:03:37.601 --> 00:03:38.434
<v Speaker 1>Someone expressed to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was actually a distant cousin who is </v>

91
00:03:40.151 --> 00:03:42.850
<v Speaker 1>a writer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wrote an email to me and he said,</v>

92
00:03:42.851 --> 00:03:43.684
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dilemma is being famous before </v>

93
00:03:46.451 --> 00:03:48.160
<v Speaker 1>you're famous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I thought that was a really good way</v>

94
00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:48.641
<v Speaker 1>of putting it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

95
00:03:48.641 --> 00:03:49.474
<v Speaker 1>I saw John Green and hank green and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>started to watch the vlog where those </v>

96
00:03:51.101 --> 00:03:51.934
<v Speaker 1>videos and I was inspired by them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but mostly I was inspired by the </v>

97
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.840
<v Speaker 1>community of nerdfighteria.</v>

98
00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.270
<v Speaker 1>I just had this feeling that maybe a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of you have to,</v>

99
00:03:58.271 --> 00:03:59.104
<v Speaker 1>that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the future of art and expression is </v>

100
00:04:01.811 --> 00:04:02.644
<v Speaker 1>going to be within these communities </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are built online and elsewhere </v>

101
00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.040
<v Speaker 1>where people from all over the world can</v>
<v Speaker 1>get together and share what they did and</v>

102
00:04:09.041 --> 00:04:09.874
<v Speaker 1>I started thinking I'm willing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>support anybody in nerdfighteria who's </v>

103
00:04:11.981 --> 00:04:14.350
<v Speaker 1>got something to show some form of </v>
<v Speaker 1>expression,</v>

104
00:04:14.351 --> 00:04:16.210
<v Speaker 1>whether,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's art or science,</v>

105
00:04:16.211 --> 00:04:17.044
<v Speaker 1>any of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As long as there's some merit to it and </v>

106
00:04:18.671 --> 00:04:21.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>America comes from practice and practice</v>

107
00:04:21.221 --> 00:04:22.031
<v Speaker 1>and practice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

108
00:04:22.031 --> 00:04:24.220
<v Speaker 1>Everything's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Everybody's going to be good for the</v>

109
00:04:24.221 --> 00:04:26.290
<v Speaker 1>people who are and they're a part of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>

110
00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna support you because that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>what a community is.</v>

111
00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:29.351
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm hoping this,</v>

112
00:04:29.351 --> 00:04:32.310
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's like I get myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

113
00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how old this publishing </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing is going to work.</v>

114
00:04:34.211 --> 00:04:35.044
<v Speaker 1>I'm going into the breach when I'm done </v>
<v Speaker 1>revising this book and I hope that </v>

115
