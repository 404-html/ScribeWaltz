1
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:15.633
<v Speaker 1>Batman historian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll brooker one set the defining </v>

2
00:00:19.281 --> 00:00:24.281
<v Speaker 1>characteristic of Gotham city must be </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was always correct</v>

3
00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.030
<v Speaker 2>night and day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has only increased police forces,</v>

4
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.880
<v Speaker 2>helpless to cope with the situation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they have an ally.</v>

5
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.043
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

6
00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.410
<v Speaker 1>There has to be crime in Gotham because </v>
<v Speaker 1>Batman is on one key level,</v>

7
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:43.573
<v Speaker 1>the one who fights crime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This highlights the inseparable </v>

8
00:00:46.911 --> 00:00:47.744
<v Speaker 1>connection between Batman and his city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually more like a circular </v>

9
00:00:51.231 --> 00:00:55.400
<v Speaker 1>connection and that one is always </v>
<v Speaker 1>creating and perpetuating the other.</v>

10
00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.293
<v Speaker 1>It was Gotham city that killed Bruce </v>
<v Speaker 1>Wayne's parents in the form of a petty </v>

11
00:00:59.691 --> 00:01:00.524
<v Speaker 1>thief that it's corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Conditions created sending in motion a </v>

12
00:01:03.351 --> 00:01:04.184
<v Speaker 1>chain of events that led to the Batman's</v>
<v Speaker 1>obsessive mission to rid them of crime </v>

13
00:01:08.211 --> 00:01:12.860
<v Speaker 1>and obsession that fostered a darker and</v>
<v Speaker 1>more twisted criminality.</v>

14
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm an agent of chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the beginning,</v>

15
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.260
<v Speaker 1>Gotham was just a backdrop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a setting,</v>

16
00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.140
<v Speaker 1>and deep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't even Gotham.</v>

17
00:01:21.141 --> 00:01:21.974
<v Speaker 1>It was New York City until detective </v>
<v Speaker 1>comics number 48 in the 1943 and 49 </v>

18
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.240
<v Speaker 1>television serial's of Batman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of the action,</v>

19
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.640
<v Speaker 1>largely due to budgets takes place in </v>
<v Speaker 1>interiors on sound stages.</v>

20
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.770
<v Speaker 1>Little attempt is made to signify Gotham</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a whole.</v>

21
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.520
<v Speaker 1>The same is true for the Adam West </v>
<v Speaker 1>Batman series in the 19 sixties when the</v>

22
00:01:40.521 --> 00:01:41.354
<v Speaker 1>character was at the height of camp </v>
<v Speaker 1>scrub through the entire feature length </v>

23
00:01:44.241 --> 00:01:48.740
<v Speaker 1>movie from 1966 and you won't see so </v>
<v Speaker 1>much as a skyscraper.</v>

24
00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:50.143
<v Speaker 1>When the Adam West show failed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Batman writers brought a darker tone to </v>

25
00:01:53.751 --> 00:01:54.584
<v Speaker 1>the stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They brought an extended continuity and </v>

26
00:01:56.571 --> 00:01:57.404
<v Speaker 1>continuity meant that individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>locations in Gotham gained importance </v>

27
00:02:01.101 --> 00:02:04.760
<v Speaker 1>and the city itself started to breathe </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a character.</v>

28
00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:05.623
<v Speaker 1>This run of dark comics culminated in </v>
<v Speaker 1>1986 with Frank Miller's dark knight </v>

29
00:02:10.011 --> 00:02:10.844
<v Speaker 1>returns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which plumbed the obsessive tortured </v>

30
00:02:13.281 --> 00:02:14.114
<v Speaker 1>psyche of the Batman and found a </v>
<v Speaker 1>counterpoint to that troubled mind in </v>

31
00:02:17.511 --> 00:02:20.660
<v Speaker 1>the diseased crime ridden streets of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gotham.</v>

32
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.280
<v Speaker 1>That essential feeling was intensified </v>
<v Speaker 1>even more and three years later,</v>

33
00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:26.383
<v Speaker 1>Gotham city became a nightmare in what </v>
<v Speaker 1>has become the most iconic imagining of </v>

34
00:02:33.501 --> 00:02:34.334
<v Speaker 1>the caped crusaders home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tim Burton and Anton first fashioned to </v>

35
00:02:37.701 --> 00:02:38.534
<v Speaker 1>city as if hell burst through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pavement and grew drawing from a number </v>

36
00:02:42.441 --> 00:02:47.441
<v Speaker 1>of garishly juxtaposed architectural </v>
<v Speaker 1>styles and the charcoal drawings of Hugh</v>

37
00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.900
<v Speaker 1>Ferris.</v>

38
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:48.733
<v Speaker 1>The creators of 1990 nines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Batman took the eighties fears of </v>

39
00:02:52.401 --> 00:02:56.510
<v Speaker 1>worsening crime and augmented them to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>kafkaesque love.</v>

40
00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.660
<v Speaker 1>That aesthetic was made more grand and </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Burton's sequel Batman returns,</v>

41
00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.010
<v Speaker 1>and three years later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a batman forever depicted at Gotham that</v>

42
00:03:06.011 --> 00:03:07.780
<v Speaker 1>was flashier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>colorful,</v>

43
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.500
<v Speaker 1>somehow even more removed from reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>

44
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.393
<v Speaker 1>what was mccobb and genuinely inspired </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Burton's imagination became Gadi and </v>

45
00:03:17.711 --> 00:03:18.544
<v Speaker 1>genuinely ridiculous in 1997 fourth </v>
<v Speaker 1>installment in the series Batman and </v>

46
00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.760
<v Speaker 1>Robin as monkey business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet as the movie's soured,</v>

47
00:03:27.761 --> 00:03:30.910
<v Speaker 1>Burton's vision of Gotham television and</v>
<v Speaker 1>comics,</v>

48
00:03:30.911 --> 00:03:31.744
<v Speaker 1>we're taking all the best parts of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>1989 aesthetic and developing a deeper </v>

49
00:03:35.771 --> 00:03:38.620
<v Speaker 1>identity for the city and the Stellar </v>
<v Speaker 1>Batman,</v>

50
00:03:38.621 --> 00:03:42.190
<v Speaker 1>the animated series.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gotham city is all dark deco,</v>

51
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.233
<v Speaker 1>as if the 19 thirties world's fair had </v>
<v Speaker 1>gone on for another 60 years in the </v>

52
00:03:46.991 --> 00:03:50.320
<v Speaker 1>comics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Batman was more low than ever to leave.</v>

53
00:03:50.321 --> 00:03:51.154
<v Speaker 1>Gotham and Gotham itself became more </v>
<v Speaker 1>isolated and separated from the rest of </v>

54
00:03:54.491 --> 00:03:55.180
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

55
00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.013
<v Speaker 1>And the famous art called no man's land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The national government chooses to </v>

56
00:03:58.871 --> 00:04:03.520
<v Speaker 1>abandoned Gotham entirely after the city</v>
<v Speaker 1>is almost destroyed by an earthquake.</v>

57
00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.960
<v Speaker 1>The island quickly carved up by gangs </v>
<v Speaker 1>and villains becomes a hell on earth.</v>

58
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.340
<v Speaker 1>Christopher Nolan made a similar </v>
<v Speaker 1>isolating move in Batman begins when the</v>

59
00:04:12.341 --> 00:04:13.174
<v Speaker 1>police raised the bridges to stop escape</v>
<v Speaker 1>criminals from fleeing the city and </v>

60
00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.670
<v Speaker 1>again in the dark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knight rises,</v>

61
00:04:18.671 --> 00:04:19.504
<v Speaker 1>when Bain destroys those bridges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course Nolan's Gotham is decidedly </v>

62
00:04:23.951 --> 00:04:27.100
<v Speaker 1>more grounded and realistic than its </v>
<v Speaker 1>predecessors,</v>

63
00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.510
<v Speaker 1>especially in the Dark Knight Burton's </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gotham may be more nightmarish,</v>

64
00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.353
<v Speaker 1>but a Gotham that resembles our own </v>
<v Speaker 1>world can be even more terrifying when </v>

65
00:04:36.281 --> 00:04:37.114
<v Speaker 1>it's shown to be fragile in the face of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a violent disregard for the established </v>

66
00:04:41.351 --> 00:04:42.184
<v Speaker 1>order from its earliest onscreen </v>
<v Speaker 1>depictions in the 19 forties to the </v>

67
00:04:46.301 --> 00:04:47.134
<v Speaker 1>latest in a series of gruesome video </v>
<v Speaker 1>games and a network tv show that bears </v>

68
00:04:50.831 --> 00:04:51.664
<v Speaker 1>its name.</v>

69
00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:56.850
<v Speaker 1>Gotham has been flexible to account for </v>
<v Speaker 1>a changing world and a changing Batman.</v>

70
00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:59.023
<v Speaker 1>The one constant is crying and </v>
<v Speaker 1>irrepressible criminal underclass that </v>

71
00:05:03.821 --> 00:05:04.654
<v Speaker 1>plagues the streets with whom the police</v>
<v Speaker 1>are either in league or powerless to </v>

72
00:05:08.771 --> 00:05:10.060
<v Speaker 1>stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>

73
00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.983
<v Speaker 1>the Batman is by definition unable to </v>
<v Speaker 1>stop this scourge to or else his </v>

74
00:05:15.341 --> 00:05:18.700
<v Speaker 1>existence would be unjustified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You defending a city,</v>

75
00:05:18.701 --> 00:05:19.534
<v Speaker 1>so corrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have infiltrated every level of its </v>

76
00:05:21.971 --> 00:05:23.410
<v Speaker 1>infrastructure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gotham,</v>

77
00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:24.303
<v Speaker 1>I think is totally unique in the history</v>
<v Speaker 1>of cities real or imagined existing for </v>

78
00:05:29.771 --> 00:05:30.604
<v Speaker 1>more than 70 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have an exhaustive knowledge of it's </v>

79
00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:34.743
<v Speaker 1>attitude of its field of places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like Wayne Tower or Arkham </v>

80
00:05:38.831 --> 00:05:40.270
<v Speaker 1>asylum on crime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Allie,</v>

81
00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:42.003
<v Speaker 1>yet unlike a real city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't map it out in the traditional </v>

82
00:05:45.161 --> 00:05:50.161
<v Speaker 1>sense and every attempt to do so is </v>
<v Speaker 1>subject to change in sort of absurd.</v>

83
00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:51.993
<v Speaker 1>Gotham is a city that's performed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know it by the stories that happened </v>

84
00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.740
<v Speaker 1>there by the spaces generated from </v>
<v Speaker 1>encounters in the night.</v>

85
00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.900
<v Speaker 1>In this view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's many versions.</v>

86
00:06:02.901 --> 00:06:03.734
<v Speaker 1>Don't register as inconsistencies would </v>
<v Speaker 1>cohere into perhaps a new way to think </v>

87
00:06:08.931 --> 00:06:13.931
<v Speaker 1>of cities as a site of constant </v>
<v Speaker 1>reinvention and varied interpretation as</v>

88
00:06:14.151 --> 00:06:19.151
<v Speaker 1>an expression of the traumas that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>reenacted by those who have suffered and</v>

89
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:23.450
<v Speaker 1>as a place that can't be mapped by its </v>
<v Speaker 1>buildings and streets,</v>

90
00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:28.780
<v Speaker 1>but by the events and people and minds </v>
<v Speaker 1>that make them</v>

91
00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:36.420
<v Speaker 3>everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and thanks for watching.</v>

92

<v Speaker 3>that you're not seeing anywhere else on </v>
