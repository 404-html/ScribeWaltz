1
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.970
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee on a Tuesday in 19</v>

2
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.090
<v Speaker 1>the pole j Getty Museum in Los Angeles </v>
<v Speaker 1>is beautiful,</v>

3
00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.030
<v Speaker 1>not only for the breathtaking artifacts </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's large collection,</v>

4
00:00:24.031 --> 00:00:28.050
<v Speaker 1>but for the palatial architecture and </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the experience of going there to the</v>

5
00:00:28.051 --> 00:00:28.884
<v Speaker 1>top of that mountain and a trolley car </v>
<v Speaker 1>above the city from some of its </v>

6
00:00:31.471 --> 00:00:32.304
<v Speaker 1>balconies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see the entirety of greater Los </v>

7
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.890
<v Speaker 1>Angeles sat beneath its film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>move,</v>

8
00:00:35.891 --> 00:00:37.950
<v Speaker 1>smug,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can see the ocean and the West.</v>

9
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:39.053
<v Speaker 1>It's gardens or tranquil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can sit on the grass and enjoy the </v>

10
00:00:41.131 --> 00:00:44.880
<v Speaker 1>day and then it's back down the trolley </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you feel educated,</v>

11
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:45.743
<v Speaker 1>cultured better for the experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next morning over coffee and you </v>

12
00:00:48.451 --> 00:00:49.284
<v Speaker 1>read in the paper that archeological </v>
<v Speaker 1>sites in Iraq have been ravaged by </v>

13
00:00:51.991 --> 00:00:52.824
<v Speaker 1>looters who have sunk holes into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dirt and rip thousands of year old </v>

14
00:00:55.891 --> 00:00:56.724
<v Speaker 1>artifacts from the ground to sell them </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the market for cat still fresh from </v>

15
00:00:59.761 --> 00:01:00.510
<v Speaker 1>your trip to the getty.</v>

16
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.343
<v Speaker 1>Your newfound sense of culture is </v>
<v Speaker 1>outraged by such disregard for history </v>

17
00:01:04.621 --> 00:01:05.454
<v Speaker 1>and you begin to think of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>artifacts you saw yesterday in the </v>

18
00:01:06.751 --> 00:01:09.510
<v Speaker 1>museum as the luckiest orphans in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

19
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.550
<v Speaker 1>Thank God for museums.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>

20
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.413
<v Speaker 1>thank God for the getty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the essential problem of the </v>

21
00:01:14.191 --> 00:01:15.024
<v Speaker 1>antiquities market.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the one side you have leaders who </v>

22
00:01:16.261 --> 00:01:17.094
<v Speaker 1>everybody hates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and on the other side you have museums </v>

23
00:01:18.151 --> 00:01:18.984
<v Speaker 1>which everybody loves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to see at first glance that </v>

24
00:01:21.121 --> 00:01:23.520
<v Speaker 1>these two things are unavoidably </v>
<v Speaker 1>connected.</v>

25
00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:24.390
<v Speaker 1>See looters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Luke,</v>

26
00:01:24.391 --> 00:01:25.224
<v Speaker 1>because there's money in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are poor people and they need to </v>

27
00:01:27.091 --> 00:01:28.170
<v Speaker 1>feed their families.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

28
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.090
<v Speaker 1>so let's say that it circulates around </v>
<v Speaker 1>the village,</v>

29
00:01:30.091 --> 00:01:30.924
<v Speaker 1>that there is a man entailed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>willing to pay good money for Sumerian </v>

30
00:01:34.081 --> 00:01:35.550
<v Speaker 1>cylinder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seals from the Babylonian era,</v>

31
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.490
<v Speaker 1>and the guy next door knows exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>where to find them.</v>

32
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.443
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our would be luder travels with his </v>

33
00:01:40.981 --> 00:01:43.710
<v Speaker 1>neighbor in the middle of the night to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the chosen archaeological site and sinks</v>

34
00:01:43.711 --> 00:01:46.830
<v Speaker 1>holes into the ground looking for </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sumerian cylinder seals.</v>

35
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:47.663
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't find anything for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eventually he comes upon a pocket of </v>

36
00:01:50.611 --> 00:01:51.444
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now his shovel has smashed five beyond </v>

37
00:01:53.131 --> 00:01:53.964
<v Speaker 1>all recognition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but two are still intact even in good </v>

38
00:01:56.341 --> 00:01:57.174
<v Speaker 1>condition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this will feed his family for a </v>

39
00:01:58.981 --> 00:01:59.814
<v Speaker 1>month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he goes to town and seeks the buyer </v>

40
00:02:00.901 --> 00:02:01.734
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now he pays a little bit less than was </v>

41
00:02:02.971 --> 00:02:03.804
<v Speaker 1>reported,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but beggars can't be choosers and this </v>

42
00:02:05.281 --> 00:02:06.114
<v Speaker 1>is his first time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the buyer is excited because these </v>

43
00:02:07.591 --> 00:02:08.424
<v Speaker 1>cylinder seals are very hot right now </v>
<v Speaker 1>among private collectors and he expects </v>

44
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.923
<v Speaker 1>a good turnover from here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The cylinder seals run a complicated </v>

45
00:02:14.911 --> 00:02:15.744
<v Speaker 1>route of buyers and sellers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>smugglers and dealers across oceans and </v>

46
00:02:18.331 --> 00:02:19.164
<v Speaker 1>international borders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe staying awhile in the Geneva </v>

47
00:02:21.241 --> 00:02:24.900
<v Speaker 1>freeport where storage items are exempt </v>
<v Speaker 1>from customs regulations,</v>

48
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to keep a low profile.</v>

49
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.980
<v Speaker 1>It's an almost impossible route to </v>
<v Speaker 1>follow.</v>

50
00:02:28.981 --> 00:02:29.814
<v Speaker 1>An antiquities dealers are very good at </v>
<v Speaker 1>confusing the authorities who mostly </v>

51
00:02:32.251 --> 00:02:35.100
<v Speaker 1>stay five steps behind and out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>jurisdiction.</v>

52
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.030
<v Speaker 1>Eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those very,</v>

53
00:02:36.031 --> 00:02:39.390
<v Speaker 1>very old Sumerian cylinder seals will </v>
<v Speaker 1>end up in one of two places.</v>

54
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.790
<v Speaker 1>Private collections or museum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

55
00:02:41.791 --> 00:02:42.630
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because like I said,</v>

56
00:02:42.631 --> 00:02:46.830
<v Speaker 1>those seals are very hot right now and </v>
<v Speaker 1>in an estimated $4,000,000,000</v>

57
00:02:46.831 --> 00:02:49.740
<v Speaker 1>a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Industry hot is really.</v>

58
00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.510
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dealer is fooled the authorities,</v>

59
00:02:51.511 --> 00:02:52.344
<v Speaker 1>but it's small potatoes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you consider how much they fooled </v>

60
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.073
<v Speaker 1>us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see the whole thing can be boiled down </v>

61
00:02:56.221 --> 00:03:00.250
<v Speaker 1>to a simple business model.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Supply and demand without demand.</v>

62
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.113
<v Speaker 1>There is no supply and so museums like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the getty in Los Angeles where the met </v>

63
00:03:04.241 --> 00:03:05.074
<v Speaker 1>in New York City or the MFA in Boston </v>
<v Speaker 1>can go on demanding elicit artifacts </v>

64
00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:11.800
<v Speaker 1>because most people don't realize that </v>
<v Speaker 1>this causes this.</v>

65
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.840
<v Speaker 1>It's why when people like Philippe de </v>
<v Speaker 1>Montebello,</v>

66
00:03:13.841 --> 00:03:15.850
<v Speaker 1>the former director of the met say </v>
<v Speaker 1>things like,</v>

67
00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.710
<v Speaker 1>we're lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>allergist abandoned the shivering orphan</v>

68
00:03:17.711 --> 00:03:19.390
<v Speaker 1>child on a cold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rainy day in the street.</v>

69
00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:20.500
<v Speaker 1>Defense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>defensive their practices,</v>

70
00:03:20.501 --> 00:03:22.450
<v Speaker 1>we can call a big bullshit.</v>

71
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.130
<v Speaker 1>These people are the parents orphaning </v>
<v Speaker 1>their children off the metaphor.</v>

72
00:03:27.131 --> 00:03:27.964
<v Speaker 1>It isn't really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was Montebello in 2006 who had to </v>

73
00:03:29.441 --> 00:03:30.274
<v Speaker 1>return the fame Euphronios Krater to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Italy after it was shown to have had </v>

74
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.140
<v Speaker 1>been clearly alluded from a tomb and </v>
<v Speaker 1>secretary.</v>

75
00:03:35.141 --> 00:03:35.974
<v Speaker 1>He later said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much more could you learn from </v>

76
00:03:37.061 --> 00:03:39.130
<v Speaker 1>knowing which particular hole that came </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of?</v>

77
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.233
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this just shows you how ignorant these </v>

78
00:03:41.831 --> 00:03:44.590
<v Speaker 1>people really are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As the answer to his question is,</v>

79
00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.360
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>virtually every.</v>

80
00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.670
<v Speaker 1>There's an archeological term called </v>
<v Speaker 1>provenience.</v>

81
00:03:48.671 --> 00:03:49.504
<v Speaker 1>It means the location of an object in </v>
<v Speaker 1>three dimensional space in relation to </v>

82
00:03:52.241 --> 00:03:53.074
<v Speaker 1>all the things around it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another word would be context and </v>

83
00:03:55.211 --> 00:03:56.044
<v Speaker 1>objects for tells us 99 percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>information about its significance and </v>

84
00:03:58.901 --> 00:03:59.734
<v Speaker 1>use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's why archeologists use all those </v>

85
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.700
<v Speaker 1>little tools to dig things up to </v>
<v Speaker 1>preserve the provenience.</v>

86
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:04.840
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so an example.</v>

87
00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:05.683
<v Speaker 1>If a Roman coin was found by a </v>
<v Speaker 1>snorkelers off the coast of Alexandria </v>

88
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.513
<v Speaker 1>and sold to museum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the experts there could probably tell </v>

89
00:04:11.561 --> 00:04:15.310
<v Speaker 1>you a lot about what year it was made </v>
<v Speaker 1>and what meant it came from even in.</v>

90
00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.260
<v Speaker 1>That's a nice amount of superficial </v>
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

91
00:04:17.261 --> 00:04:18.094
<v Speaker 1>Let's say the circle or didn't touch the</v>
<v Speaker 1>coin and instead reported the fine will </v>

92
00:04:20.321 --> 00:04:21.154
<v Speaker 1>archeologists searching the area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then find many more coins and not only </v>

93
00:04:23.531 --> 00:04:26.620
<v Speaker 1>can they tell you about the year that it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was made in the mint that it came from,</v>

94
00:04:26.621 --> 00:04:27.454
<v Speaker 1>but they can start to tell you a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>story about the shipping trade in the </v>

95
00:04:30.851 --> 00:04:33.910
<v Speaker 1>Roman era.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mediterranean Sea context is everything.</v>

96
00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.070
<v Speaker 1>The aim of archeology is to tell the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most true,</v>

97
00:04:36.071 --> 00:04:36.904
<v Speaker 1>most comprehensive story about the past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>under the assumption that both the past </v>

98
00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:43.030
<v Speaker 1>and the truth are worth something to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In 2007,</v>

99
00:04:43.031 --> 00:04:43.864
<v Speaker 1>the getty returned 40 artifacts to Italy</v>
<v Speaker 1>under mounting pressure from </v>

100
00:04:45.851 --> 00:04:46.684
<v Speaker 1>international authorities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now they did it quietly and without </v>

101
00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:49.653
<v Speaker 1>admitting wrongdoing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but these repatriations are becoming </v>

102
00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:52.624
<v Speaker 1>more to stop the supply.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to choke the demand and to do </v>

103
00:04:55.211 --> 00:04:58.720
<v Speaker 1>that you have to educate people about </v>
<v Speaker 1>how the antiquities market really works.</v>

104
00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:59.553
<v Speaker 1>You have to show them how they are being</v>
<v Speaker 1>fooled by palatial architecture and </v>

105
00:05:01.751 --> 00:05:02.584
<v Speaker 1>great presentation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to say to them that though </v>

106
00:05:03.851 --> 00:05:04.684
<v Speaker 1>these places are undeniably beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting as they do on the top of </v>

107
00:05:07.121 --> 00:05:07.954
<v Speaker 1>mountains above the city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there are cultures being destroyed </v>

108
00:05:10.361 --> 00:05:11.194
<v Speaker 1>and forgotten every day and they had </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own ideas about architecture and </v>

109
00:05:14.321 --> 00:05:15.154
<v Speaker 1>presentation in beauty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't you think that their ideas in our </v>

110
00:05:17.921 --> 00:05:20.410
<v Speaker 1>culture has a right to be remembered </v>
<v Speaker 1>correctly?</v>

111
00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.260
<v Speaker 1>High nerd writer here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is my friend Sam.</v>

112
00:05:23.261 --> 00:05:25.030
<v Speaker 1>He just finished making a World War II </v>
<v Speaker 1>short,</v>

113
00:05:25.031 --> 00:05:25.864
<v Speaker 1>epic called the American starring made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to check it out and I suggest </v>

114
00:05:28.631 --> 00:05:30.130
<v Speaker 1>that you do it because it is pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking awesome.</v>

115
00:05:30.131 --> 00:05:33.790
<v Speaker 1>You can find that link in the doodly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do anything to add Sam.</v>
