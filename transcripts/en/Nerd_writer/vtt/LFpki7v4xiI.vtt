1
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:06.503
<v Speaker 1>The first 28 minutes of saving private </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ryan are devoted to the bloody allied </v>

2
00:00:10.531 --> 00:00:14.940
<v Speaker 1>invasion of Omaha beach on June six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1944.</v>

3
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.900
<v Speaker 1>The scene is rightly regarded as one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the best battle scenes in film history.</v>

4
00:00:18.901 --> 00:00:19.734
<v Speaker 1>Thanks to a brutal and unflinching </v>
<v Speaker 1>recreation by Steven Spielberg by </v>

5
00:00:23.611 --> 00:00:26.370
<v Speaker 1>placing this extended scene right at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>start of the film,</v>

6
00:00:26.371 --> 00:00:27.204
<v Speaker 1>it's clear that Spielberg's goal was to </v>
<v Speaker 1>drop the viewer right into the action </v>

7
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.033
<v Speaker 1>without warning a traumatic experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>that leaves the viewer on edge for the </v>

8
00:00:35.221 --> 00:00:39.390
<v Speaker 1>rest of the movie and this way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spielberg mimics the exhaustion that the</v>

9
00:00:39.391 --> 00:00:44.040
<v Speaker 1>allied soldiers had to fight through for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the entirety of their time at war,</v>

10
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.720
<v Speaker 1>but to create and realize the scenes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spielberg had to reconcile a fundamental</v>

11
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:49.583
<v Speaker 1>contradiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The sequence had to be chaotic and </v>

12
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.200
<v Speaker 1>coherent at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

13
00:00:55.201 --> 00:00:58.950
<v Speaker 1>the critical impression of the battle </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be one of randomness,</v>

14
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.660
<v Speaker 1>of violence and death occurring so </v>
<v Speaker 1>rapidly and indiscriminately at the mind</v>

15
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:04.740
<v Speaker 1>is bewildered.</v>

16
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:05.573
<v Speaker 1>It has no time to process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that randomness has to be </v>

17
00:01:08.551 --> 00:01:12.150
<v Speaker 1>communicated cinematically via some sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of structure,</v>

18
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.530
<v Speaker 1>a coherence that somehow leaves you with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the feeling of chaos.</v>

19
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.393
<v Speaker 1>What Spielberg is trying to do is fill </v>
<v Speaker 1>in two different kinds of gaps in our </v>

20
00:01:20.791 --> 00:01:22.950
<v Speaker 1>knowledge about this historical moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>

21
00:01:22.951 --> 00:01:23.784
<v Speaker 1>he wants to close the gap between </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood's heroic depictions of World </v>

22
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.953
<v Speaker 1>War II and the vicious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deeply harrowing experiences of those </v>

23
00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:31.943
<v Speaker 1>who were actually there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean even in strong depictions of the </v>

24
00:01:34.141 --> 00:01:36.750
<v Speaker 1>Normandy landings like the great 1962 </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie,</v>

25
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.870
<v Speaker 1>the longest day filmed entirely on </v>
<v Speaker 1>tripods.</v>

26
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.883
<v Speaker 1>The viewer's experience is still some </v>
<v Speaker 1>distance from the subjectivity of the </v>

27
00:01:44.791 --> 00:01:45.624
<v Speaker 1>moment in saving private Ryan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spielberg wants to shrink that distance </v>

28
00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:48.790
<v Speaker 1>as much</v>

29
00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:49.623
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>

30
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.833
<v Speaker 1>The other gaps Spielberg wants to close </v>
<v Speaker 1>is the one between what we know about </v>

31
00:01:55.961 --> 00:01:58.540
<v Speaker 1>this event and what we've actually seen </v>
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>

32
00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.940
<v Speaker 1>There is extremely little footage of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Normandy invasion on June six,</v>

33
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:03.793
<v Speaker 1>1944,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and almost none from the landing at </v>

34
00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.290
<v Speaker 1>Omaha Beach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there are a lot of reasons for this.</v>

35
00:02:08.291 --> 00:02:09.124
<v Speaker 1>A significant percentage of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cameramen who filmed the war for the </v>

36
00:02:11.111 --> 00:02:11.944
<v Speaker 1>allied powers were killed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The remaining did their best to avoid </v>

37
00:02:14.951 --> 00:02:15.784
<v Speaker 1>that same fate by finding places of </v>
<v Speaker 1>cover where they could film at a </v>

38
00:02:18.671 --> 00:02:20.050
<v Speaker 1>distance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For this reason,</v>

39
00:02:20.051 --> 00:02:23.890
<v Speaker 1>you get a lot of footage from before the</v>
<v Speaker 1>landing at Normandy on the boats,</v>

40
00:02:23.891 --> 00:02:24.724
<v Speaker 1>which Spielberg recreates in saving </v>
<v Speaker 1>private Ryan and a lot of footage after </v>

41
00:02:27.731 --> 00:02:29.980
<v Speaker 1>the battle is over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>During the chaos,</v>

42
00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.873
<v Speaker 1>cameramen were doing their best to keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves and their cameras out of </v>

43
00:02:34.181 --> 00:02:36.730
<v Speaker 1>danger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Documentaries that Spielberg relied more</v>

44
00:02:36.731 --> 00:02:38.920
<v Speaker 1>on were shot far from the Normandy </v>
<v Speaker 1>beaches,</v>

45
00:02:38.921 --> 00:02:41.200
<v Speaker 1>specifically with the Marines at </v>
<v Speaker 1>Toronto,</v>

46
00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.140
<v Speaker 1>which was shot in Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the battle for San Pietro,</v>

47
00:02:44.141 --> 00:02:46.900
<v Speaker 1>which was made by the famous filmmaker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Houston.</v>

48
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.933
<v Speaker 1>It'll be watching that second film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spielberg was struck by how cameramen </v>

49
00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:52.143
<v Speaker 1>always stayed low to the ground and how </v>
<v Speaker 1>the camera shook when an explosion went </v>

50
00:02:55.271 --> 00:02:59.770
<v Speaker 1>off nearby as critic toby higgins notes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spielberg discovered that he adopted the</v>

51
00:02:59.771 --> 00:03:01.930
<v Speaker 1>style of the battlefield.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cameraman,</v>

52
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.430
<v Speaker 1>he could achieve a more subjective </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience of the war and that's exactly</v>

53
00:03:06.431 --> 00:03:07.264
<v Speaker 1>what he did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the footage that I think has the </v>

54
00:03:09.101 --> 00:03:13.870
<v Speaker 1>most impact on the Omaha beach scene is </v>
<v Speaker 1>John Ford's masterful war film.</v>

55
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.913
<v Speaker 1>The Battle of midway from 1942 in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>film forward brilliantly keeps in </v>

56
00:03:19.541 --> 00:03:24.541
<v Speaker 1>moments when blasts affect the camera </v>
<v Speaker 1>gate or knock his hand held cameras back</v>

57
00:03:24.551 --> 00:03:26.590
<v Speaker 1>and forth from this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In some creative editing,</v>

58
00:03:26.591 --> 00:03:29.080
<v Speaker 1>you get a much more visceral impression </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the battle,</v>

59
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.910
<v Speaker 1>so the essence of the idea for saving </v>
<v Speaker 1>private Ryan is here and it's obvious in</v>

60
00:03:33.911 --> 00:03:34.744
<v Speaker 1>the battlefield camera approach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what's not so obvious is how </v>

61
00:03:37.571 --> 00:03:41.440
<v Speaker 1>Spielberg takes this essence and injects</v>
<v Speaker 1>it with steroids.</v>

62
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:42.513
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that Spielberg does </v>

63
00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.280
<v Speaker 1>that no actual war time camera man could</v>
<v Speaker 1>do is switch perspectives.</v>

64
00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.250
<v Speaker 1>The Omaha beach scene functions from </v>
<v Speaker 1>three different perspectives,</v>

65
00:03:51.251 --> 00:03:54.220
<v Speaker 1>the vantage of the invisible battlefield</v>
<v Speaker 1>cameraman,</v>

66
00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.870
<v Speaker 1>the vantage of Tom Hanks and the vantage</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the German soldiers on the top of the</v>

67
00:03:58.871 --> 00:03:59.704
<v Speaker 1>cliffs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spielberg alternates between these to </v>

68
00:04:01.451 --> 00:04:02.284
<v Speaker 1>give a more 360 degree perspective on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the battle without losing any of the </v>

69
00:04:05.921 --> 00:04:08.500
<v Speaker 1>immediacy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is his primary concern.</v>

70
00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:09.453
<v Speaker 1>Even crazier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It actually took me a few watches to </v>

71
00:04:10.841 --> 00:04:15.841
<v Speaker 1>realize that this shot right here is </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually meant to be a moment inside Tom</v>

72
00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.750
<v Speaker 1>Hanks head like the most intense first </v>
<v Speaker 1>person shooter game ever.</v>

73
00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.973
<v Speaker 1>This kind of thing couched,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost hidden in the middle of the rest </v>

74
00:04:23.351 --> 00:04:27.790
<v Speaker 1>of the footage intensifies that feeling </v>
<v Speaker 1>of being there to its most extreme.</v>

75
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.833
<v Speaker 1>Maybe this is why the sequence triggered</v>
<v Speaker 1>actual ptsd and if you world war two </v>

76
00:04:32.471 --> 00:04:33.304
<v Speaker 1>veterans who watched the film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the key to understanding how </v>

77
00:04:36.191 --> 00:04:37.024
<v Speaker 1>Spielberg squares chaos with coherence </v>
<v Speaker 1>is in the amount of information that he </v>

78
00:04:42.101 --> 00:04:43.720
<v Speaker 1>crammed into each shot.</v>

79
00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.990
<v Speaker 1>The Omaha beach scene might seem like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the craziest,</v>

80
00:04:46.991 --> 00:04:49.510
<v Speaker 1>fastest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most intense sequence in the film,</v>

81
00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.610
<v Speaker 1>but I counted the shots and the scene </v>
<v Speaker 1>that lasts exactly 24 minutes.</v>

82
00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:55.653
<v Speaker 1>There are exactly 200 shots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means that every shot averages </v>

83
00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:01.503
<v Speaker 1>seven point two seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that is an incredibly high </v>

84
00:05:05.261 --> 00:05:09.070
<v Speaker 1>average for a scene like this and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't seem right to me until I actually</v>

85
00:05:09.071 --> 00:05:11.770
<v Speaker 1>went back and watched the scene with </v>
<v Speaker 1>this in mind.</v>

86
00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.150
<v Speaker 1>You're asked to comprehend so much in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this Omaha beach scene,</v>

87
00:05:16.151 --> 00:05:19.930
<v Speaker 1>so Spielberg eases the pressure on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain by panning,</v>

88
00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:20.793
<v Speaker 1>tilting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or moving the camera when others would </v>

89
00:05:23.141 --> 00:05:24.190
<v Speaker 1>just cut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This way.</v>

90
00:05:24.191 --> 00:05:27.490
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to waste too much mental </v>
<v Speaker 1>energy on orienting yourself.</v>

91
00:05:27.491 --> 00:05:30.160
<v Speaker 1>You can absorb the relevant information </v>
<v Speaker 1>as it comes,</v>

92
00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:31.053
<v Speaker 1>and Spielberg is great at feeding you </v>
<v Speaker 1>relevant information as my friend Tony </v>

93
00:05:34.271 --> 00:05:35.104
<v Speaker 1>wants remark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a guy who loves to move the </v>

94
00:05:36.671 --> 00:05:40.840
<v Speaker 1>camera with motivation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so in a 12 second shot like this one,</v>

95
00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:41.793
<v Speaker 1>you get a wide shot to close ups,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three inserts and the medium shot eight </v>

96
00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:47.043
<v Speaker 1>pieces of information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the transitions here are really </v>

97
00:05:49.511 --> 00:05:50.344
<v Speaker 1>great too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He loves to start a long shot with the </v>

98
00:05:52.001 --> 00:05:52.834
<v Speaker 1>action from the previous moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is how he strings together all </v>

99
00:05:55.601 --> 00:05:56.434
<v Speaker 1>these mini vignettes and it gives them a</v>
<v Speaker 1>forward momentum that keeps the viewer </v>

100
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.433
<v Speaker 1>on track.</v>

101
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.073
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so much more to say about the </v>

102
00:06:07.191 --> 00:06:08.024
<v Speaker 1>scene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the sound mixing and the lenses </v>

103
00:06:09.441 --> 00:06:10.274
<v Speaker 1>and the de Saturation of the film stock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the costume design and the set </v>

104
00:06:13.251 --> 00:06:16.280
<v Speaker 1>design,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's all been well covered before.</v>

105
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:17.503
<v Speaker 1>What inspires me about this scene is how</v>
<v Speaker 1>such a Maelstrom of action retains its </v>

106
00:06:22.971 --> 00:06:27.860
<v Speaker 1>focus from end to end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't just stage some insanity film,</v>

107
00:06:27.861 --> 00:06:28.694
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of it from different angles and </v>
<v Speaker 1>hope to find a through line in the </v>

108
00:06:30.741 --> 00:06:33.380
<v Speaker 1>editing a scene with an impact like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

109
00:06:33.381 --> 00:06:36.740
<v Speaker 1>something that you can revisit again and</v>
<v Speaker 1>again and find new things.</v>

110
00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:41.180
<v Speaker 1>It takes real cinematic concentration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

111
00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:46.630
<v Speaker 1>anyone can capture chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but only the best can capture chaos with</v>

112
00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:49.573
<v Speaker 1>clarity.</v>

113

<v Speaker 3>Wednesday,</v>
