1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:06.553
<v Speaker 2>how do you change an entire industry for</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jeff Bezos and his new grocery store of </v>

3
00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.920
<v Speaker 2>the future?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amazon go.</v>

4
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.950
<v Speaker 2>It's a three part process in no </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular order.</v>

5
00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.730
<v Speaker 2>Part one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make a video with over 7 million views.</v>

6
00:00:19.731 --> 00:00:22.970
<v Speaker 2>Amazon's youtube video is a bit of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Utopian science fiction,</v>

7
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:23.863
<v Speaker 2>a vision for what the future of grocery </v>
<v Speaker 2>shopping could look like and almost </v>

8
00:00:26.841 --> 00:00:31.250
<v Speaker 2>completely frictionless consumer </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience in which you walk in,</v>

9
00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:32.173
<v Speaker 2>grab what you want and go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The marketing here is extremely </v>

10
00:00:34.821 --> 00:00:35.571
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

11
00:00:35.571 --> 00:00:36.404
<v Speaker 2>Notice that Amazon drop this video like </v>
<v Speaker 2>beyonce drops a surprise album and they </v>

12
00:00:40.101 --> 00:00:40.934
<v Speaker 2>made sure to disable the comments and </v>
<v Speaker 2>declined to take questions about the </v>

13
00:00:43.881 --> 00:00:45.890
<v Speaker 2>concept from journalists for the time </v>
<v Speaker 2>being.</v>

14
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.970
<v Speaker 2>I think the point is to let the idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>gestate in the public's mind,</v>

15
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.193
<v Speaker 2>letting us internalize the ease and </v>
<v Speaker 2>stress free environment of our future </v>

16
00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.310
<v Speaker 2>grocery stores.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This internalization that hope goes will</v>

17
00:00:58.311 --> 00:00:59.144
<v Speaker 2>flower into an expectation and </v>
<v Speaker 2>expectation is a very powerful force </v>

18
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.180
<v Speaker 2>that can move markets.</v>

19
00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:06.043
<v Speaker 2>This potential for change is crucial for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the second important thing part to get </v>

20
00:01:10.011 --> 00:01:10.844
<v Speaker 2>the patents in 2013 and 2014.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amazon filed two patents that describe </v>

21
00:01:15.351 --> 00:01:19.730
<v Speaker 2>most of the advanced technology we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing inside the Amazon go store.</v>

22
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:20.593
<v Speaker 2>The first call detecting item </v>
<v Speaker 2>interaction and movement describes a </v>

23
00:01:22.911 --> 00:01:27.410
<v Speaker 2>system for tracking removal or placement</v>
<v Speaker 2>of items at inventory locations,</v>

24
00:01:27.411 --> 00:01:28.244
<v Speaker 2>just like you saw on the video using a </v>
<v Speaker 2>variety of sensors and cameras with </v>

25
00:01:31.251 --> 00:01:32.084
<v Speaker 2>object recognition software.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The second expands on this concept </v>

26
00:01:34.971 --> 00:01:38.330
<v Speaker 2>covering the payment of items when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>leave a designated area.</v>

27
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:39.493
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both these patents were filed primarily </v>

28
00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:42.134
<v Speaker 2>for use in Amazon's warehouses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but even then they were putting in </v>

29
00:01:45.891 --> 00:01:48.480
<v Speaker 2>little hints about their longer term </v>
<v Speaker 2>goals.</v>

30
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.810
<v Speaker 2>I think I don't see what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are we doing?</v>

31
00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.073
<v Speaker 2>Part prove that once Amazon creates the </v>
<v Speaker 2>expectation for a customer experience </v>

32
00:01:59.721 --> 00:02:00.554
<v Speaker 2>defined by technology that they own,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the logical thing to do would be to </v>

33
00:02:03.981 --> 00:02:06.410
<v Speaker 2>start building the Amazon go stores.</v>

34
00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:07.603
<v Speaker 2>You're likely to see Amazon start doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that once they fix all the bugs with </v>

35
00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:11.263
<v Speaker 2>their Beta location in Seattle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think this obscures the much </v>

36
00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.320
<v Speaker 2>bigger fish that Amazon is trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>catch here.</v>

37
00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:19.663
<v Speaker 2>To understand what I'm talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to look at another part of </v>

38
00:02:21.501 --> 00:02:25.280
<v Speaker 2>Amazon's business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amazon web services.</v>

39
00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:26.413
<v Speaker 2>The massive cloud computing Juggernaut </v>
<v Speaker 2>that as of 2016 is the most profitable </v>

40
00:02:30.531 --> 00:02:34.100
<v Speaker 2>segment of Amazon's entire business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically years ago,</v>

41
00:02:34.101 --> 00:02:34.934
<v Speaker 2>Amazon built an online infrastructure to</v>
<v Speaker 2>host and organize its own site and then </v>

42
00:02:39.111 --> 00:02:39.944
<v Speaker 2>they realized that they could take this </v>
<v Speaker 2>technology and license it to other </v>

43
00:02:43.401 --> 00:02:48.080
<v Speaker 2>companies from this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amazon collects billions in fees.</v>

44
00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:49.580
<v Speaker 2>The Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you know,</v>

45
00:02:49.581 --> 00:02:51.980
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't exist without Amazon web </v>
<v Speaker 2>services,</v>

46
00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.570
<v Speaker 2>Netflix,</v>
<v Speaker 2>NASA,</v>

47
00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.400
<v Speaker 2>Reddit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Obama campaign,</v>

48
00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.920
<v Speaker 2>pinterest and the CIA are all hosted on </v>
<v Speaker 2>its servers and a lot more.</v>

49
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:01.323
<v Speaker 2>It's a business that's growing fast and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's 10 times the size of its next 14 </v>

50
00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:06.970
<v Speaker 2>competitors combined.</v>

51
00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:08.413
<v Speaker 2>It was Brian Romilly that payment's </v>
<v Speaker 2>expert who pointed me in the direction </v>

52
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.440
<v Speaker 2>of Amazon web services and and once you </v>
<v Speaker 2>learn that business model,</v>

53
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.450
<v Speaker 2>it's easy to predict where Amazon is </v>
<v Speaker 2>heading.</v>

54
00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:17.343
<v Speaker 2>They want to combine their patents with </v>
<v Speaker 2>marketing that creates this expectation </v>

55
00:03:21.281 --> 00:03:25.510
<v Speaker 2>of a frictionless shopping experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they'll build a number of stores to</v>

56
00:03:25.511 --> 00:03:26.344
<v Speaker 2>prove the concept.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the time they have a few 100 and </v>

57
00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:32.500
<v Speaker 2>operation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the amount of refined targeted data that</v>

58
00:03:32.501 --> 00:03:36.490
<v Speaker 2>we'll be able to acquire on customers </v>
<v Speaker 2>will make the model irresistible.</v>

59
00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.853
<v Speaker 2>Komodo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>welcome back to the gap sort of tank </v>

60
00:03:40.261 --> 00:03:44.770
<v Speaker 2>tops for gap for you and that point </v>
<v Speaker 2>Amazon just has to wait.</v>

61
00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.993
<v Speaker 2>Supermarket chains nowhere near capable </v>
<v Speaker 2>of retrofitting their stores with this </v>

62
00:03:48.821 --> 00:03:49.654
<v Speaker 2>kind of tech will have one shiny place </v>
<v Speaker 2>to turn for all their needs and just </v>

63
00:03:53.711 --> 00:03:54.544
<v Speaker 2>like it does with its web services.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amazon will license like crazy with </v>

64
00:03:58.541 --> 00:04:01.420
<v Speaker 2>their eyes toward dominating not just </v>
<v Speaker 2>supermarkets,</v>

65
00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.030
<v Speaker 2>but the entire retail universe.</v>

66
00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.960
<v Speaker 2>A $25,000,000,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>industry in the US alone.</v>

67
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.870
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amazon go is just,</v>

68
00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:19.920
<v Speaker 2>hey everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thanks for watching.</v>
