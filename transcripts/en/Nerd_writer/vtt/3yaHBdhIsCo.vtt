1
00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:06.040
<v Speaker 1>There's something about treasure that </v>
<v Speaker 1>capture every imagination,</v>

2
00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:10.840
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's our love for adventure or our</v>
<v Speaker 1>love for solving puzzles,</v>

3
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.533
<v Speaker 1>or maybe it's just the anxiety of </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing that something's out there </v>

4
00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:20.020
<v Speaker 1>waiting to be found in the mid 19 </v>
<v Speaker 1>seventies in England,</v>

5
00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.040
<v Speaker 1>they're renowned publisher Tom Maschler </v>
<v Speaker 1>approached a little known painter by the</v>

6
00:00:24.041 --> 00:00:24.874
<v Speaker 1>name of Kit Williams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the idea of making a children's </v>

7
00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:28.743
<v Speaker 1>picture book maschler when it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that no one had ever done </v>

8
00:00:30.791 --> 00:00:33.550
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Williams was resistant to the idea.</v>

9
00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.980
<v Speaker 1>He didn't want to work on a dozen or </v>
<v Speaker 1>more paintings,</v>

10
00:00:35.981 --> 00:00:38.170
<v Speaker 1>only to have people flip through them </v>
<v Speaker 1>casually.</v>

11
00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:39.213
<v Speaker 1>How could he get readers to give his </v>
<v Speaker 1>pictures the attention they deserve </v>

12
00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:43.323
<v Speaker 1>without telling maschler Williams came </v>
<v Speaker 1>up with the idea of a puzzle book </v>

13
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:47.553
<v Speaker 1>containing 16 original paintings that </v>
<v Speaker 1>had clues to the location of the 18 </v>

14
00:00:51.701 --> 00:00:56.701
<v Speaker 1>karat gold rabbit that he constructed </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself and buried somewhere in England.</v>

15
00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:02.150
<v Speaker 1>Now the has been buried for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The book was called masquerade.</v>

16
00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.340
<v Speaker 1>It was published in 1979 and it was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>massive hit.</v>

17
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.233
<v Speaker 1>It went completely crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We thought we'd have enough till </v>

18
00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.980
<v Speaker 1>Christmas and we reprinted a further </v>
<v Speaker 1>50,000</v>

19
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.550
<v Speaker 1>a day off to publication and three days </v>
<v Speaker 1>later,</v>

20
00:01:15.551 --> 00:01:17.930
<v Speaker 1>yet another $50,000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've really never seen it,</v>

21
00:01:17.931 --> 00:01:20.110
<v Speaker 1>but blanket thousands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tens of thousands,</v>

22
00:01:20.111 --> 00:01:24.100
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of thousands of people set </v>
<v Speaker 1>about solving the puzzle of masquerade.</v>

23
00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.030
<v Speaker 1>A year went by and to and still nobody </v>
<v Speaker 1>had cracked it,</v>

24
00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.330
<v Speaker 1>but Williams was receiving huge numbers </v>
<v Speaker 1>of letters every day,</v>

25
00:01:31.331 --> 00:01:35.620
<v Speaker 1>which she was forced to read or at least</v>
<v Speaker 1>skim through so he could confirm whether</v>

26
00:01:35.621 --> 00:01:36.730
<v Speaker 1>anyone had solved it.</v>

27
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.290
<v Speaker 2>This package,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this has been going on for so long.</v>

28
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:46.980
<v Speaker 2>Then</v>

29
00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.280
<v Speaker 1>in March 1982,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little over two and a half years after</v>

30
00:01:50.281 --> 00:01:51.114
<v Speaker 1>Williams buried the hair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he received a letter from a man named </v>

31
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.533
<v Speaker 1>Ken Thomas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The letter didn't have any insight into </v>

32
00:01:56.641 --> 00:01:58.950
<v Speaker 1>how the puzzle system worked in </v>
<v Speaker 1>masquerade,</v>

33
00:01:58.951 --> 00:01:59.784
<v Speaker 1>but there was a crude map that pointed </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the exact place where the treasure </v>

34
00:02:03.481 --> 00:02:06.660
<v Speaker 1>was hidden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Williams relieved at this point told him</v>

35
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.790
<v Speaker 1>that he was right and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go dig it up.</v>

36
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.150
<v Speaker 1>The puzzle of masquerade is completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>unique.</v>

37
00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:13.043
<v Speaker 1>Williams invented it himself so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>theoretically anyone of any age could </v>

38
00:02:16.261 --> 00:02:18.360
<v Speaker 1>figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's how it works.</v>

39
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:19.583
<v Speaker 1>Every page feature is at intricately </v>
<v Speaker 1>designed picture surrounded by an order </v>

40
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.533
<v Speaker 1>with a phrase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The trick was to identify every living </v>

41
00:02:27.631 --> 00:02:32.370
<v Speaker 1>creature in the frame and trace a line </v>
<v Speaker 1>from its left I through its lefthand.</v>

42
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.410
<v Speaker 1>It's right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I threw its right hand,</v>

43
00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.290
<v Speaker 1>it's left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I threw its left foot and it's right,</v>

44
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:38.700
<v Speaker 1>it's right foot.</v>

45
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.863
<v Speaker 1>These lines would point to letters and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the border that could be anjem tumbled </v>

46
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:43.583
<v Speaker 1>into a word in this case burden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you follow this pattern for all 15 </v>

47
00:02:48.061 --> 00:02:48.894
<v Speaker 1>pages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd end up with a master phrase that </v>

48
00:02:50.671 --> 00:02:51.504
<v Speaker 1>goes like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Catherine's long finger overshadows </v>

49
00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.780
<v Speaker 1>birth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>buried yellow ambulant midday points.</v>

50
00:02:57.781 --> 00:03:00.100
<v Speaker 1>The Hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In light of equinox,</v>

51
00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:01.103
<v Speaker 1>look to figure out what this means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to take the first letter from </v>

52
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.670
<v Speaker 1>each pages word or words and string them</v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

53
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.570
<v Speaker 1>If you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get close by and that's it.</v>

54
00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.680
<v Speaker 1>MTL refers to the town of mtl about an </v>
<v Speaker 1>hour north of London,</v>

55
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:15.723
<v Speaker 1>and Catherine's long finger refers to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the tall cross that commemorates </v>

56
00:03:18.101 --> 00:03:20.560
<v Speaker 1>Katherine of Aragon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first wife of King Henry,</v>

57
00:03:20.561 --> 00:03:21.394
<v Speaker 1>the eighth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>located in Mtl Park at noon on the </v>

58
00:03:23.771 --> 00:03:24.604
<v Speaker 1>equinox.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Sun projects a shadow of that cross </v>

59
00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:27.813
<v Speaker 1>onto a specific spot in the grass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where Williams hit the golden </v>

60
00:03:31.421 --> 00:03:32.254
<v Speaker 1>hair.</v>

61
00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.440
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never found it,</v>

62
00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:50.243
<v Speaker 1>and that's how kit Williams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>masquerade golden hair was finally </v>

63
00:03:53.221 --> 00:03:56.490
<v Speaker 1>found,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except there's a problem.</v>

64
00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.940
<v Speaker 1>There is no Ken Thomas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see,</v>

65
00:03:59.941 --> 00:04:00.774
<v Speaker 1>six years after the nationwide search </v>
<v Speaker 1>was over the Sunday Times in Britain </v>

66
00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.003
<v Speaker 1>with the help of a local paper and Mtl </v>
<v Speaker 1>discovered that Ken Thomas was actually </v>

67
00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:09.653
<v Speaker 1>a pseudonym for duke called Thompson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was the business partner of a man </v>

68
00:04:13.741 --> 00:04:17.160
<v Speaker 1>named John Guard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who at the time of masquerade was living</v>

69
00:04:17.161 --> 00:04:20.190
<v Speaker 1>with Kit Williams ex-girlfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Veronica Robertson.</v>

70
00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:21.593
<v Speaker 1>Robertson had been to [inaudible] park </v>
<v Speaker 1>with Williams on a couple of occasions </v>

71
00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.540
<v Speaker 1>and guests that might've had the prize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their garden.</v>

72
00:04:27.541 --> 00:04:30.660
<v Speaker 1>Thompson middle detected the whole area </v>
<v Speaker 1>dug holes,</v>

73
00:04:30.661 --> 00:04:31.494
<v Speaker 1>but he couldn't find it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was only after they saw were two </v>

74
00:04:34.081 --> 00:04:36.720
<v Speaker 1>physics teachers who had actually solve </v>
<v Speaker 1>the puzzle,</v>

75
00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.320
<v Speaker 1>had been digging that they were able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>snatch the hair for themselves.</v>

76
00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.660
<v Speaker 1>By the time everyone found out about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this scandal,</v>

77
00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:43.523
<v Speaker 1>Thompson had already used the hair to </v>
<v Speaker 1>start a video game company called hair </v>

78
00:04:47.191 --> 00:04:47.940
<v Speaker 1>soft.</v>

79
00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:48.773
<v Speaker 1>Its flagship title.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hair razor was a puzzle game that </v>

80
00:04:51.541 --> 00:04:52.374
<v Speaker 1>promise the real golden hair to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>winter game is pretty much </v>

81
00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.560
<v Speaker 1>incomprehensible in hilarious video on </v>
<v Speaker 1>hair racer,</v>

82
00:04:58.561 --> 00:04:59.394
<v Speaker 1>comedian stuart ash,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and details why it's probably </v>

83
00:05:01.441 --> 00:05:03.750
<v Speaker 1>unsolvable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll leave a link to it below.</v>

84
00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:04.673
<v Speaker 1>Nevertheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the time that the expo say on </v>

85
00:05:06.061 --> 00:05:06.894
<v Speaker 1>masquerade came out in [inaudible] 88,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the company had gone bankrupt and the </v>

86
00:05:10.411 --> 00:05:15.360
<v Speaker 1>golden hair was sold by Southerby's at </v>
<v Speaker 1>auction for 32,000</v>

87
00:05:15.361 --> 00:05:16.194
<v Speaker 1>pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one knows who bought it though the </v>

88
00:05:18.331 --> 00:05:19.164
<v Speaker 1>BBC did track it down for a documentary </v>
<v Speaker 1>on Williams in 2009 after which it went </v>

89
00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.270
<v Speaker 1>back to its owners to live in secrecy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once again,</v>

90
00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:28.950
<v Speaker 1>nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think she again,</v>

91
00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:30.780
<v Speaker 1>never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever say that again.</v>

92
00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:35.930
<v Speaker 1>Masquerade launched a new genre of </v>
<v Speaker 1>armchair treasure hunts like forest fens</v>

93
00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.870
<v Speaker 1>million dollar chest of antiques,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hiding somewhere in the rocky mountains,</v>

94
00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.913
<v Speaker 1>still unsolved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and our love for hidden treasure is </v>

95
00:05:42.721 --> 00:05:43.554
<v Speaker 1>clear in the popularity of books like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Davinci Code or games like pokemon </v>

96
00:05:47.731 --> 00:05:51.450
<v Speaker 1>go or in escape rooms which have </v>
<v Speaker 1>flourished across the world.</v>

97
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.980
<v Speaker 1>It's just fun to solve a puzzle and go </v>
<v Speaker 1>searching for treasure.</v>

98
00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:57.163
<v Speaker 1>Still a declaration of independence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't steal the declaration of </v>

99
00:06:03.471 --> 00:06:04.304
<v Speaker 1>independence.</v>

100
00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:09.793
<v Speaker 1>One of the questions that I get asked </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time is what kind of program do </v>

101
00:06:13.011 --> 00:06:13.844
<v Speaker 1>I use to put these videos together?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I use final cut pro 10 tate at the nerd </v>

102
00:06:17.361 --> 00:06:21.950
<v Speaker 1>writer and there was actually a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit of a hubbub when 10 came out because</v>

103
00:06:21.951 --> 00:06:25.570
<v Speaker 1>apple completely redesigned the program </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the previous version.</v>

104
00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:26.413
<v Speaker 1>Final cut pro seven and editing tool </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I had used for over 10 years was </v>

105
00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:31.243
<v Speaker 1>gone and it sucked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but eventually I learned how to use </v>

106
00:06:33.381 --> 00:06:35.690
<v Speaker 1>final cut pro 10 by watching a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube videos.</v>

107
00:06:35.691 --> 00:06:36.524
<v Speaker 1>But what I really wish I had with </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like today's sponsor </v>
