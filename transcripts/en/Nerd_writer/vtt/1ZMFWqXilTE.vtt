00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.860
<v Speaker 1>Coffee on a Tuesday in blog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>31.</v>

2
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.000
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

3
00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:12.360
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

4
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.540
<v Speaker 1>so did you see this new Google video </v>
<v Speaker 1>floating around?</v>

5
00:00:21.541 --> 00:00:22.374
<v Speaker 1>Project glass in which all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>information that you can access on your </v>

6
00:00:25.621 --> 00:00:26.454
<v Speaker 1>smartphone is put into these very sleek </v>
<v Speaker 1>glasses and made a part of your regular </v>

7
00:00:30.241 --> 00:00:31.350
<v Speaker 1>vision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That surprised me,</v>

8
00:00:31.351 --> 00:00:34.950
<v Speaker 1>that Google put this ad out because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>must mean they think that there are more</v>

9
00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:37.320
<v Speaker 1>people who would see this and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

10
00:00:37.321 --> 00:00:39.000
<v Speaker 1>that's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want that.</v>

11
00:00:39.001 --> 00:00:42.510
<v Speaker 1>Then those who would almost reflexively </v>
<v Speaker 1>be terrified by it.</v>

12
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.400
<v Speaker 1>The video was shot in first person so as</v>
<v Speaker 1>to put the viewer in the experience,</v>

13
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.293
<v Speaker 1>and I wonder if I was the only one who </v>
<v Speaker 1>felt a palpable sense of intrusion when </v>

14
00:00:52.411 --> 00:00:53.244
<v Speaker 1>the first icons launched into the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>add functions as a sort of metaphor for </v>

15
00:00:57.691 --> 00:00:58.524
<v Speaker 1>social media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something that is wedging its way into </v>

16
00:01:00.031 --> 00:01:00.864
<v Speaker 1>our lives and the culture is so </v>
<v Speaker 1>successfully that we can't help but to </v>

17
00:01:03.391 --> 00:01:04.860
<v Speaker 1>participate in it with everyone else.</v>

18
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:05.723
<v Speaker 1>This is the effect of all new </v>
<v Speaker 1>technologies they create needs that you </v>

19
00:01:08.701 --> 00:01:12.000
<v Speaker 1>did not have before needs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you can abstain from satisfying or</v>

20
00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:12.834
<v Speaker 1>even recognizing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but only until they apply to that </v>

21
00:01:14.551 --> 00:01:15.384
<v Speaker 1>critical mass of people at that point </v>
<v Speaker 1>not to use the technology actually puts </v>

22
00:01:18.721 --> 00:01:22.530
<v Speaker 1>you at a disadvantage in communication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People begin to get angry with you,</v>

23
00:01:22.531 --> 00:01:24.840
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're all but forced to conform.</v>

24
00:01:24.841 --> 00:01:28.080
<v Speaker 1>Think of cell phones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can choose not to have one,</v>

25
00:01:28.081 --> 00:01:31.470
<v Speaker 1>but are you willing to suffer the </v>
<v Speaker 1>frustration and displeasure of all those</v>

26
00:01:31.471 --> 00:01:33.840
<v Speaker 1>who feel entitled to get in touch with </v>
<v Speaker 1>you at any time?</v>

27
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.883
<v Speaker 1>You can cling to your principles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what happens when those principles </v>

28
00:01:37.231 --> 00:01:40.290
<v Speaker 1>come into tension with relationships?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not willing to compromise.</v>

29
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.183
<v Speaker 1>You may say you don't want to be friends</v>
<v Speaker 1>with anyone who doesn't respect your </v>

30
00:01:43.921 --> 00:01:45.600
<v Speaker 1>choice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to be plugged in.</v>

31
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.120
<v Speaker 1>That might work today with facebook and </v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter,</v>

32
00:01:48.121 --> 00:01:50.280
<v Speaker 1>but not really anymore with cell phones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

33
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.160
<v Speaker 1>What job today doesn't require you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a cell phone?</v>

34
00:01:53.161 --> 00:01:55.560
<v Speaker 1>What job today doesn't require you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a smartphone?</v>

35
00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.590
<v Speaker 1>It's in this way that technology's wedge</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves into the culture.</v>

36
00:01:58.591 --> 00:02:00.000
<v Speaker 1>Over time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Individually,</v>

37
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.923
<v Speaker 1>you may disagree with the technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you like everyone else has a stake </v>

38
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.913
<v Speaker 1>in culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so as far as the culture accepts </v>

39
00:02:06.931 --> 00:02:07.770
<v Speaker 1>facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter,</v>

40
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:08.800
<v Speaker 1>cell phones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smartphones,</v>

41
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:09.653
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will have to compromise your values </v>

42
00:02:11.221 --> 00:02:13.290
<v Speaker 1>to the extent that you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>participate in it.</v>

43
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.780
<v Speaker 1>We're all pulled along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

44
00:02:15.781 --> 00:02:16.614
<v Speaker 1>the culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe tomorrow you decide that you'll </v>

45
00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:18.683
<v Speaker 1>never watch a youtube video again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't be someone who never </v>

46
00:02:22.471 --> 00:02:23.304
<v Speaker 1>watched a youtube video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no doubt it's a terrifying prospect and </v>

47
00:02:25.591 --> 00:02:26.424
<v Speaker 1>you're not human if you don't feel even </v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit overwhelmed by cultural </v>

48
00:02:29.161 --> 00:02:29.994
<v Speaker 1>changes of this nature and even more </v>
<v Speaker 1>overwhelmed when you realize that the </v>

49
00:02:32.161 --> 00:02:36.510
<v Speaker 1>changes are coming at an accelerating </v>
<v Speaker 1>rate and devices like the Google glasses</v>

50
00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.260
<v Speaker 1>will be ubiquitous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not tomorrow or next year,</v>

51
00:02:40.261 --> 00:02:42.090
<v Speaker 1>but in a relatively short time.</v>

52
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.080
<v Speaker 1>You begin to wonder who decides what </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes next.</v>

53
00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.943
<v Speaker 1>In the postwar fifties and sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>manufacturers created dozens and dozens </v>

54
00:02:50.071 --> 00:02:53.250
<v Speaker 1>of new appliances for the growing number</v>
<v Speaker 1>of middle class homes,</v>

55
00:02:53.251 --> 00:02:55.290
<v Speaker 1>appliances that they perhaps didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>need,</v>

56
00:02:55.291 --> 00:03:00.291
<v Speaker 1>but a capitalist economy is structured </v>
<v Speaker 1>toward growth toward corporations needed</v>

57
00:03:00.521 --> 00:03:03.430
<v Speaker 1>to build and create new products for </v>
<v Speaker 1>consumption.</v>

58
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.790
<v Speaker 1>You see the same trend today in </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology and social media.</v>

59
00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:06.643
<v Speaker 1>The differences that in the past it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>physical products that you could put </v>

60
00:03:09.851 --> 00:03:14.851
<v Speaker 1>somewhere the advances in upgrades in </v>
<v Speaker 1>tech instead have the effect of small,</v>

61
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.843
<v Speaker 1>gradual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unsolicited alterations to our </v>

62
00:03:17.621 --> 00:03:18.454
<v Speaker 1>personalities and that's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of literature out there </v>

63
00:03:20.831 --> 00:03:25.150
<v Speaker 1>already on the way the Internet age is </v>
<v Speaker 1>affecting our minds and social behavior.</v>

64
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.260
<v Speaker 1>Many say that it's a boon connecting us </v>
<v Speaker 1>to more people and more information.</v>

65
00:03:29.261 --> 00:03:30.094
<v Speaker 1>Others say that social media only gives </v>
<v Speaker 1>the illusion of being more connected </v>

66
00:03:33.731 --> 00:03:36.040
<v Speaker 1>when in fact we are more separated and </v>
<v Speaker 1>alone.</v>

67
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.260
<v Speaker 1>There is truth to both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure,</v>

68
00:03:38.261 --> 00:03:41.140
<v Speaker 1>and this is only the first chapter in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>long story,</v>

69
00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.520
<v Speaker 1>but this weekend I had the pleasure to </v>
<v Speaker 1>take a trip to the beautiful desert east</v>

70
00:03:45.521 --> 00:03:46.354
<v Speaker 1>of Los Angeles and sitting there among </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sparse vegetation decompressing </v>

71
00:03:50.351 --> 00:03:51.184
<v Speaker 1>after 30 weeks of Lugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had the feeling that social media </v>

72
00:03:54.731 --> 00:03:55.564
<v Speaker 1>doesn't so much corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our ability to be social as it does our </v>

73
00:03:58.541 --> 00:03:59.374
<v Speaker 1>ability to be alone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to savor that much needed solitude and </v>

74
00:04:03.761 --> 00:04:04.594
<v Speaker 1>silence in which so many things are </v>
<v Speaker 1>reconciled and put in their proper </v>

75
00:04:07.841 --> 00:04:08.674
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe it's this condition of </v>

76
00:04:11.141 --> 00:04:14.020
<v Speaker 1>perpetual half measures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>half alone,</v>

77
00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.883
<v Speaker 1>half together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time that we should be most </v>

78
00:04:17.501 --> 00:04:20.110
<v Speaker 1>careful to guard against,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if not for the culture at large.</v>

79
00:04:20.111 --> 00:04:20.944
<v Speaker 1>Then at least for ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the first and biggest drop off the </v>

80
00:04:25.181 --> 00:04:26.014
<v Speaker 1>top of the jar.</v>

81
00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.700
<v Speaker 4>So far,</v>
<v Speaker 4>happy faces at all times.</v>

82
00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.810
<v Speaker 4>Peter Pan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>peanut butter on.</v>
