00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.850
<v Speaker 1>One of my favorite comics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>masterpiece mouse,</v>

2
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.940
<v Speaker 1>comes in the very first chapter here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The comic,</v>

3
00:00:12.941 --> 00:00:13.774
<v Speaker 1>if you don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is about spiegelman's father's </v>

4
00:00:15.341 --> 00:00:18.010
<v Speaker 1>experience in the Holocaust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More specifically,</v>

5
00:00:18.011 --> 00:00:21.820
<v Speaker 1>it's about spiegelman's own efforts to </v>
<v Speaker 1>come to grips with that experience while</v>

6
00:00:21.821 --> 00:00:25.570
<v Speaker 1>navigating a really strained </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship with his dad.</v>

7
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.433
<v Speaker 1>Mouse is obsessed with this </v>
<v Speaker 1>correspondence between the past and the </v>

8
00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.640
<v Speaker 1>present and it's a theme that Spiegelman</v>
<v Speaker 1>is determined to workout visually in his</v>

9
00:00:33.641 --> 00:00:35.380
<v Speaker 1>comic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does he do that?</v>

10
00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:36.573
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's take a look at the page that I </v>

11
00:00:37.181 --> 00:00:38.014
<v Speaker 1>mentioned earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Panel by panel in the first </v>

12
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:40.713
<v Speaker 1>spiegelman's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Father Vladik takes his grown son </v>

13
00:00:42.371 --> 00:00:43.204
<v Speaker 1>already backup to his old bedroom after </v>
<v Speaker 1>dinner so that he can do some exercise </v>

14
00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.390
<v Speaker 1>already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The past is signaled here with the empty</v>

15
00:00:49.391 --> 00:00:50.224
<v Speaker 1>bedroom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have a child that's moved out in the </v>

16
00:00:51.611 --> 00:00:52.444
<v Speaker 1>second panel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We get a closer look at that room and </v>

17
00:00:53.771 --> 00:00:56.680
<v Speaker 1>what Vlad ics done with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More remnants of the past,</v>

18
00:00:56.681 --> 00:00:59.410
<v Speaker 1>like the pennant banner from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Spiegelman's College Harper,</v>

19
00:00:59.411 --> 00:01:01.060
<v Speaker 1>where he studied art and philosophy.</v>

20
00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.990
<v Speaker 1>We get our first glimpse of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>exercycle that Vladik uses to work out,</v>

21
00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.153
<v Speaker 1>and this is where art broaches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the subject of the book that we're </v>

22
00:01:08.711 --> 00:01:09.544
<v Speaker 1>reading now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>notice that the body's of both father </v>

23
00:01:11.501 --> 00:01:12.334
<v Speaker 1>and son are leaning at the same angle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spiegelman's asking his dad to open up </v>

24
00:01:15.761 --> 00:01:16.594
<v Speaker 1>so he parallels his body language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's also equating these two men </v>

25
00:01:19.931 --> 00:01:23.800
<v Speaker 1>visually and the book will continue to </v>
<v Speaker 1>compare and contrast them until the end.</v>

26
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.933
<v Speaker 1>In the third panel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the heads are parallel this time arts </v>

27
00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.113
<v Speaker 1>looking at a picture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we won't learn what it is until a </v>

28
00:01:29.801 --> 00:01:32.890
<v Speaker 1>few panels down and the fourth panel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing changes,</v>

29
00:01:32.891 --> 00:01:33.724
<v Speaker 1>but art's head which swivels around to </v>
<v Speaker 1>his father as he makes his request </v>

30
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:37.723
<v Speaker 1>explicit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we come to the fifth panel </v>

31
00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.560
<v Speaker 1>which stretches the entire width of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>page.</v>

32
00:01:41.561 --> 00:01:42.394
<v Speaker 1>It has a lot going on right away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see three key signifiers of the </v>

33
00:01:45.281 --> 00:01:46.450
<v Speaker 1>past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the picture,</v>

34
00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:47.343
<v Speaker 1>the identification,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tattoo Vladik received outfits and the </v>

35
00:01:50.201 --> 00:01:54.790
<v Speaker 1>speech bubble where Vladik says it would</v>
<v Speaker 1>take many books my life and no one wants</v>

36
00:01:54.791 --> 00:01:57.970
<v Speaker 1>anyway to hear such stories as critic </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hillary Chute notes.</v>

37
00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.863
<v Speaker 1>It's as if the past articulated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inscribed in documented were flanking </v>

38
00:02:04.031 --> 00:02:08.320
<v Speaker 1>both men closing in on them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course within this rd is enclosed</v>

39
00:02:08.321 --> 00:02:10.570
<v Speaker 1>by his father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the six panel,</v>

40
00:02:10.571 --> 00:02:13.840
<v Speaker 1>we learned that the photograph is of </v>
<v Speaker 1>already mother on Joe,</v>

41
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.080
<v Speaker 1>which helps us understand the panels </v>
<v Speaker 1>that came before.</v>

42
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:18.103
<v Speaker 1>In the seventh panel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see Vladik shoe peddling with effort </v>

43
00:02:20.171 --> 00:02:22.150
<v Speaker 1>on the bike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but going nowhere.</v>

44
00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.270
<v Speaker 1>Then in the eighth and final circular </v>
<v Speaker 1>panel,</v>

45
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.133
<v Speaker 1>we get our first window into the past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the story within a story that will </v>

46
00:02:29.621 --> 00:02:31.930
<v Speaker 1>consume the book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The different shape signals,</v>

47
00:02:31.931 --> 00:02:32.764
<v Speaker 1>a new narrative thread.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While the image of latic echoes the </v>

48
00:02:35.441 --> 00:02:39.070
<v Speaker 1>photograph that's been a dominant </v>
<v Speaker 1>feature of the rest of the page</v>

49
00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.460
<v Speaker 2>and a comic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have various panels.</v>

50
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.970
<v Speaker 2>Those panels are each units of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see them simultaneously,</v>

51
00:02:44.971 --> 00:02:49.380
<v Speaker 2>so you have various moments in time </v>
<v Speaker 2>simultaneously made present.</v>

52
00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:50.363
<v Speaker 1>That's art spiegelman explaining why </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a bit unfair to do what I just did </v>

53
00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.770
<v Speaker 1>and considered the value of a panel on </v>
<v Speaker 1>its own.</v>

54
00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.530
<v Speaker 1>For spiegelman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the basic unit of comics is the page,</v>

55
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:00.543
<v Speaker 1>its basic function,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that interplay of moments that happens </v>

56
00:03:02.621 --> 00:03:06.790
<v Speaker 1>when you take in several panels all at </v>
<v Speaker 1>once in a way that's unique to comics.</v>

57
00:03:06.791 --> 00:03:11.200
<v Speaker 1>Time is made spatial spread out across a</v>
<v Speaker 1>surface so that you can see not only how</v>

58
00:03:11.201 --> 00:03:13.870
<v Speaker 1>the past affects the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but vice versa.</v>

59
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.440
<v Speaker 1>What you learn here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this picture is of art's Mom,</v>

60
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.270
<v Speaker 1>white ex wife who committed suicide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>transforms the meaning of this look here</v>

61
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:23.373
<v Speaker 1>and all it takes is a glance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the slightest movement in the eyes to </v>

62
00:03:26.381 --> 00:03:30.250
<v Speaker 1>access that connection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't need to rewind or read back or</v>

63
00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.140
<v Speaker 1>start over again on the page.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those two moments exist simultaneously.</v>

64
00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.093
<v Speaker 1>In this sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>graphic design becomes a vital part of </v>

65
00:03:38.531 --> 00:03:39.340
<v Speaker 1>comic making.</v>

66
00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.340
<v Speaker 1>As the Great Cartoonist Seth Aka Gregory</v>
<v Speaker 1>Golan once said,</v>

67
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:43.473
<v Speaker 1>the words and pictures that make up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>comics language are often described as </v>

68
00:03:46.571 --> 00:03:49.930
<v Speaker 1>pros and illustration combined a bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>metaphor.</v>

69
00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.510
<v Speaker 1>Poetry and graphic design seems more </v>
<v Speaker 1>apt.</v>

70
00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:53.643
<v Speaker 1>Poetry for the rhythm and condensing </v>
<v Speaker 1>graphic design because cartooning is </v>

71
00:03:57.401 --> 00:04:01.210
<v Speaker 1>more about moving shapes around </v>
<v Speaker 1>designing than it is about drawing.</v>

72
00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:02.163
<v Speaker 1>This page of mouse is the perfect </v>
<v Speaker 1>illustration of that sentiment and take </v>

73
00:04:05.171 --> 00:04:07.810
<v Speaker 1>a closer look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you see in this design?</v>

74
00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.920
<v Speaker 1>What about now in Spiegelman's book and </v>
<v Speaker 1>life?</v>

75
00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.280
<v Speaker 1>His father is a towering figure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is experience surviving.</v>

76
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:16.353
<v Speaker 1>The most horrifying event in history </v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes the central fact and not just </v>

77
00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:21.003
<v Speaker 1>his life but in his sons and that's how </v>
<v Speaker 1>the trauma of the Holocaust invaded the </v>

78
00:04:25.331 --> 00:04:26.164
<v Speaker 1>world and how the past invades the </v>
<v Speaker 1>present in mouse Vladik literally </v>

79
00:04:30.281 --> 00:04:35.281
<v Speaker 1>invades the page and pumping away on his</v>
<v Speaker 1>exercycle as shoot points out already.</v>

80
00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.740
<v Speaker 1>His father is literally unable to move </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward,</v>

81
00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.610
<v Speaker 1>which is why it makes sense that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>past begins in the wheel.</v>

82
00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:47.260
<v Speaker 1>If that blank art spiegelman set out to </v>
<v Speaker 1>create a comic that would be readable,</v>

83
00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:52.000
<v Speaker 1>that's why he spent 13 years writing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drawing and designing mouse.</v>

84
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.490
<v Speaker 1>Every page is a new pattern to pick </v>
<v Speaker 1>apart.</v>

85
00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.930
<v Speaker 1>A new configuration of moments passed </v>
<v Speaker 1>and president words and images.</v>

86
00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.710
<v Speaker 1>Father and son.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This attention to design is why mouse is</v>

87
00:05:02.711 --> 00:05:05.830
<v Speaker 1>often regarded as the best graphic novel</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever written.</v>

88
00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.903
<v Speaker 1>It's not that the subject matter is </v>
<v Speaker 1>inherently dramatic and effecting which </v>

89
00:05:10.511 --> 00:05:11.344
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that spiegelman wanted to tell a </v>

90
00:05:13.001 --> 00:05:13.834
<v Speaker 1>story in a way that was unique to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>comics medium though to extract the </v>

91
00:05:17.321 --> 00:05:22.030
<v Speaker 1>truth of the Holocaust and I'll just </v>
<v Speaker 1>family that only comics could tell.</v>

92

108
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:12.950
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>real quick.</v>

109
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:13.783
<v Speaker 1>Here's another page I really love for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way that it plays with how a comics </v>

110
00:06:17.241 --> 00:06:18.074
<v Speaker 1>page is normally read.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the point in the story when black </v>

111
00:06:20.211 --> 00:06:24.260
<v Speaker 1>is first entering Auschwitz.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now everyone who reads comics knows that</v>

112
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:27.380
<v Speaker 1>you're meant to go left to right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then down,</v>

113
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:28.700
<v Speaker 1>then left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right again,</v>

114
00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:29.653
<v Speaker 1>but here spiegelman cleverly uses </v>
<v Speaker 1>overlapping speech bubbles to pull you </v>

115
00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:34.184
<v Speaker 1>down the left side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and at that point you have to read down </v>

116
00:06:36.861 --> 00:06:39.990
<v Speaker 1>again and that becomes a descent into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the beast.</v>

117
00:06:39.991 --> 00:06:42.350
<v Speaker 1>Small,</v>

118
00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:44.180
<v Speaker 1>but beautiful.</v>
