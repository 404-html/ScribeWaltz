00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:03.403
<v Speaker 1>What happened to post modernism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that great intellectual movement of the </v>

2
00:00:07.281 --> 00:00:08.114
<v Speaker 1>late 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that question all objective conceptions </v>

3
00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.130
<v Speaker 1>of truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happened to it?</v>

4
00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:14.083
<v Speaker 1>Did it end?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people seem to agree that yet it </v>

5
00:00:16.881 --> 00:00:17.714
<v Speaker 1>did end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you ask those same people when </v>

6
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.900
<v Speaker 1>postmodernism ended,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't really give you an answer.</v>

7
00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.973
<v Speaker 1>This may be due to the fact that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea of postmodernism is still pretty </v>

8
00:00:28.641 --> 00:00:29.474
<v Speaker 1>fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to define it except as a </v>

9
00:00:31.281 --> 00:00:35.870
<v Speaker 1>reaction to the modernism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was created to refute that.</v>

10
00:00:35.871 --> 00:00:38.270
<v Speaker 1>Simplest way I can describe it is like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

11
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.133
<v Speaker 1>Modernism was a movement at the turn of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the 20th century dedicated to building </v>

12
00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.820
<v Speaker 1>coherent theories about all the new </v>
<v Speaker 1>information science,</v>

13
00:00:46.821 --> 00:00:49.280
<v Speaker 1>philosophy and psychology or giving to </v>
<v Speaker 1>us,</v>

14
00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:50.293
<v Speaker 1>and postmodernism was the period </v>
<v Speaker 1>directly after that in which the </v>

15
00:00:53.391 --> 00:00:58.391
<v Speaker 1>authority of all those theories was </v>
<v Speaker 1>challenged as well as the very notion of</v>

16
00:00:58.641 --> 00:01:00.200
<v Speaker 1>authority in the first place.</v>

17
00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.060
<v Speaker 1>Postmodernism is a good catchall for all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the various and chaotic ways of thinking</v>

18
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.910
<v Speaker 1>that characterize the later part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>20th century.</v>

19
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.073
<v Speaker 1>But as we neared the millennials and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>need to react to or refute modernism </v>

20
00:01:13.401 --> 00:01:14.234
<v Speaker 1>seemed less and less relevant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>postmodernism sort of fell apart and we </v>

21
00:01:18.501 --> 00:01:22.040
<v Speaker 1>were left with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well nothing indeed.</v>

22
00:01:22.041 --> 00:01:22.874
<v Speaker 1>One of the key characteristics of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>time is its inability to define itself </v>

23
00:01:26.901 --> 00:01:29.930
<v Speaker 1>with a set of intellectual ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is this?</v>

24
00:01:29.931 --> 00:01:32.630
<v Speaker 1>Why have categories like this broken </v>
<v Speaker 1>down?</v>

25
00:01:32.631 --> 00:01:35.570
<v Speaker 1>Why don't they seem to suit the </v>
<v Speaker 1>contemporary age?</v>

26
00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.330
<v Speaker 1>Is it because everything is just too </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaotic now?</v>

27
00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:39.223
<v Speaker 1>Or is it because we have too much </v>
<v Speaker 1>information and too much access for any </v>

28
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.440
<v Speaker 1>one movement to congeal and rise to </v>
<v Speaker 1>prominence?</v>

29
00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's probably true,</v>

30
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.830
<v Speaker 1>but it only tells us so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we dig a little bit deeper,</v>

31
00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:52.723
<v Speaker 1>we can see that what's really changed is</v>
<v Speaker 1>our relationship to history as science </v>

32
00:01:58.011 --> 00:02:02.030
<v Speaker 1>fiction author Bruce Sterling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one set history is not a science.</v>

33
00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.230
<v Speaker 1>History is an effort and the humanities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What sterling means is that history,</v>

34
00:02:06.231 --> 00:02:11.231
<v Speaker 1>studying it or writing it or knowing it </v>
<v Speaker 1>has always been a game of meanings.</v>

35
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:12.373
<v Speaker 1>We look back in based on certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>material facts and contemporary </v>

36
00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.213
<v Speaker 1>writings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Try to tell a coherent story about past </v>

37
00:02:19.041 --> 00:02:19.874
<v Speaker 1>cultures and their values,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the meanings they ascribe to their time </v>

38
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.350
<v Speaker 1>and existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

39
00:02:24.351 --> 00:02:27.730
<v Speaker 1>modernism and postmodernism had </v>
<v Speaker 1>something in common there.</v>

40
00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.210
<v Speaker 1>Access to history was enabled by paper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by books,</v>

41
00:02:32.211 --> 00:02:36.830
<v Speaker 1>books with covers and bindings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but more importantly with beginnings,</v>

42
00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:37.723
<v Speaker 1>middles and ends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Modernists and postmodernists thinkers </v>

43
00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.280
<v Speaker 1>had to resort to books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had no other choice.</v>

44
00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.263
<v Speaker 1>They learned the authoritative sources </v>
<v Speaker 1>on a given subject either to accept or </v>

45
00:02:47.871 --> 00:02:48.704
<v Speaker 1>refute them and by responding to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tradition they themselves became a part </v>

46
00:02:53.151 --> 00:02:55.460
<v Speaker 1>of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but these are different times.</v>

47
00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.280
<v Speaker 1>The book was replaced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was replaced with the network and the</v>

48
00:03:00.281 --> 00:03:02.980
<v Speaker 1>network doesn't respect history or </v>
<v Speaker 1>tradition.</v>

49
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.900
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you want to know something </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

50
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.943
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the philosophy of stoicism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet the very first thing you would do </v>

51
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.233
<v Speaker 1>is open up a search engine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably Google and let a complex ever </v>

52
00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.900
<v Speaker 1>changing algorithm based on views,</v>
<v Speaker 1>recency,</v>

53
00:03:16.901 --> 00:03:20.530
<v Speaker 1>filters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>phrasing and much more prioritize.</v>

54
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.180
<v Speaker 1>A list of results within that list are </v>
<v Speaker 1>all kinds of different and contradictory</v>

55
00:03:25.181 --> 00:03:29.200
<v Speaker 1>positions all the way from top </v>
<v Speaker 1>university professors to some guy on his</v>

56
00:03:29.201 --> 00:03:30.034
<v Speaker 1>couch and in each article there is </v>
<v Speaker 1>usually a common section with opinions </v>

57
00:03:33.341 --> 00:03:36.250
<v Speaker 1>about those opinions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then if you can find the author's name,</v>

58
00:03:36.251 --> 00:03:38.280
<v Speaker 1>you can go back to Google and type that </v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

59
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:39.123
<v Speaker 1>see if you can somehow determine via </v>
<v Speaker 1>their wikipedia page or number of </v>

60
00:03:42.221 --> 00:03:46.630
<v Speaker 1>twitter followers what other people </v>
<v Speaker 1>consider the level of their authenticity</v>

61
00:03:46.631 --> 00:03:48.490
<v Speaker 1>to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you can just go to youtube,</v>

62
00:03:48.491 --> 00:03:52.510
<v Speaker 1>which I often do and see if someone's </v>
<v Speaker 1>made a video about stoicism.</v>

63
00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.470
<v Speaker 1>That's a little bit easier to digest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the network culture.</v>

64
00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.560
<v Speaker 1>Everything is fluid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poorly organized,</v>

65
00:03:59.561 --> 00:04:02.860
<v Speaker 1>but extremely persuasive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Narratives accumulate,</v>

66
00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:08.040
<v Speaker 1>alter and change as quickly as Google's </v>
<v Speaker 1>algorithm does and we have access to all</v>

67
00:04:09.041 --> 00:04:12.520
<v Speaker 1>of them instantaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sterling and fellow author,</v>

68
00:04:12.521 --> 00:04:16.810
<v Speaker 1>William Gibson name this unnameable </v>
<v Speaker 1>transition period of culture.</v>

69
00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:18.123
<v Speaker 1>A temporality in which we have this </v>
<v Speaker 1>great unmooring from historical </v>

70
00:04:21.881 --> 00:04:24.970
<v Speaker 1>knowledge just makes for a lot of unease</v>
<v Speaker 1>and our time,</v>

71
00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.190
<v Speaker 1>the maps we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the network,</v>

72
00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:28.083
<v Speaker 1>the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all its social function can't seem </v>

73
00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:31.773
<v Speaker 1>to do its job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can't map a strong master narrative </v>

74
00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.500
<v Speaker 1>onto the world we see in front of us </v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

75
00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.440
<v Speaker 1>maybe someday it will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sterling gives it 10 years,</v>

76
00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.310
<v Speaker 1>but it won't look like any of the master</v>
<v Speaker 1>narratives from literary culture.</v>

77
00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:46.263
<v Speaker 1>Really we have no idea what a master </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative in network culture could look </v>

78
00:04:51.671 --> 00:04:52.211
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

79
00:04:52.211 --> 00:04:53.044
<v Speaker 1>It's easy to see that such a disruptive </v>
<v Speaker 1>break from the past also means and </v>

80
00:04:57.791 --> 00:05:01.870
<v Speaker 1>uncertainty about the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about what progress looks like,</v>

81
00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.170
<v Speaker 1>a lack of confidence in the market in </v>
<v Speaker 1>nation states,</v>

82
00:05:05.171 --> 00:05:06.004
<v Speaker 1>in groups of nation states like the EU </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the belief that democracy can be </v>

83
00:05:09.431 --> 00:05:13.330
<v Speaker 1>exported around the globe are all </v>
<v Speaker 1>symptomatic of this.</v>

84
00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.140
<v Speaker 1>A temporal transition period in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world and in the arts.</v>

85
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.760
<v Speaker 1>What you get is this collaging of past </v>
<v Speaker 1>and future in the present,</v>

86
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.950
<v Speaker 1>the repurposing of old structures and </v>
<v Speaker 1>obsessions with predicted futures of the</v>

87
00:05:26.951 --> 00:05:28.810
<v Speaker 1>past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That never came about.</v>

88
00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:30.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's more out of time,</v>

89
00:05:30.971 --> 00:05:33.730
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then stuff like steam punk.</v>

90
00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:38.050
<v Speaker 1>It's tempting to see this new historical</v>
<v Speaker 1>situation as a problem,</v>

91
00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:43.530
<v Speaker 1>but you can look at it as an opportunity</v>
<v Speaker 1>to why not take up the whirling elements</v>

92
00:05:43.991 --> 00:05:48.991
<v Speaker 1>of the past and the future and design </v>
<v Speaker 1>the contemporary moment that you want to</v>

93
00:05:49.781 --> 00:05:50.614
<v Speaker 1>see in art,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your personal life or in the public </v>

94
00:05:53.021 --> 00:05:53.854
<v Speaker 1>space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then maybe the highbrow philosophy of </v>

95
00:05:55.361 --> 00:05:56.194
<v Speaker 1>the future can't be canonized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there never will be another </v>

96
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:00.613
<v Speaker 1>Charles Dickens or George Orwell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a great freedom in losing </v>

97
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:04.183
<v Speaker 1>the Canon as well as sterling notes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Historians really used to worry that </v>

98
00:06:08.421 --> 00:06:12.980
<v Speaker 1>their interpretations of the past were </v>
<v Speaker 1>clouded by their own values.</v>

99
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:16.430
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the good news is that for us right</v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

100
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:21.170
<v Speaker 1>we just don't know what our values </v>
<v Speaker 1>really are so that whether we're looking</v>

101
00:06:21.171 --> 00:06:22.004
<v Speaker 1>back or looking forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the a temporal age and the a temporal </v>

102
00:06:25.851 --> 00:06:29.690
<v Speaker 1>person can finally see with clear eyes.</v>

103
00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:32.223
<v Speaker 1>I want to thank everybody so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who is pledged to the channel on </v>

104
00:06:34.451 --> 00:06:36.460
<v Speaker 1>Patrion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're really making this possible.</v>

105
00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:37.323
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do this full time now and I've had </v>

106
00:06:38.921 --> 00:06:43.921
<v Speaker 1>such a great time focusing all my energy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and effort on making I hope really,</v>

107
00:06:44.621 --> 00:06:47.320
<v Speaker 1>really great content for you and there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot more coming up.</v>

108
00:06:47.321 --> 00:06:48.154
<v Speaker 1>So if you haven't already,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to ask you please to pledge to </v>

109
00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:53.020
<v Speaker 1>the nerd writer on Patrion as little as </v>
<v Speaker 1>$1 per video.</v>

110
00:06:53.021 --> 00:06:54.190
<v Speaker 1>Everything helps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

111
00:06:54.191 --> 00:06:56.080
<v Speaker 1>if a bunch of people do $1,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it adds up.</v>

112
00:06:56.081 --> 00:06:58.240
<v Speaker 1>So don't be afraid to do a little if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>only have a little.</v>

113
00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:59.313
<v Speaker 1>Thank you so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to keep bringing stuff to you </v>

114
00:07:00.941 --> 00:07:03.700
<v Speaker 1>next Wednesday and if you want to check </v>
<v Speaker 1>out my last understanding art,</v>
