1
00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.940
<v Speaker 1>Anyone familiar with the work of </v>
<v Speaker 1>director?</v>

2
00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.060
<v Speaker 1>David Cronenberg knows that he has an </v>
<v Speaker 1>intense fascination with bodies,</v>

3
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.160
<v Speaker 1>physical bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bodies transformed or bodies mutilated,</v>

4
00:00:34.161 --> 00:00:39.161
<v Speaker 1>bodies dripping or bodies explode,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's no surprise that his film,</v>

5
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.490
<v Speaker 1>eastern promises opens with a focus on </v>
<v Speaker 1>three bodies,</v>

6
00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:44.653
<v Speaker 1>the sliced body of a Chechen gangster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wounded expiring body of a pregnant </v>

7
00:00:48.741 --> 00:00:49.574
<v Speaker 1>prostitute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the fragile small body of that </v>

8
00:00:52.101 --> 00:00:55.100
<v Speaker 1>woman's infant who is soaked in her </v>
<v Speaker 1>blood.</v>

9
00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:56.323
<v Speaker 1>It will eventually become clear that </v>
<v Speaker 1>these three bodies are connected by the </v>

10
00:00:59.301 --> 00:01:00.134
<v Speaker 1>films narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A point that is made explicit early on </v>

11
00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.450
<v Speaker 1>by one character's poor grasp of English</v>
<v Speaker 1>barrier secrets was her body's indeed.</v>

12
00:01:11.301 --> 00:01:12.134
<v Speaker 1>It is a central theme of Cronenberg that</v>
<v Speaker 1>body's only exist within a continuum of </v>

13
00:01:16.191 --> 00:01:20.660
<v Speaker 1>other bodies to which they are connected</v>
<v Speaker 1>and from which they gain meaning.</v>

14
00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.043
<v Speaker 1>For Cronenberg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the body is representative of the </v>

15
00:01:24.471 --> 00:01:27.620
<v Speaker 1>individual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps even more so than the mind,</v>

16
00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:28.663
<v Speaker 1>despite the fact that we're mental </v>
<v Speaker 1>creatures conceiving of things in </v>

17
00:01:31.311 --> 00:01:32.144
<v Speaker 1>abstraction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are irrevocably tied to the physical </v>

18
00:01:34.791 --> 00:01:35.624
<v Speaker 1>organism that's given to us and much of </v>
<v Speaker 1>our anxiety about aging or disease or </v>

19
00:01:40.071 --> 00:01:44.150
<v Speaker 1>deformity is directed toward the body in</v>
<v Speaker 1>eastern promises.</v>

20
00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.013
<v Speaker 1>The physical reality of the body is </v>
<v Speaker 1>examined in the context of the equally </v>

21
00:01:48.591 --> 00:01:49.424
<v Speaker 1>physical reality of collective violence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of which bodies are it's perpetrators </v>

22
00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:54.793
<v Speaker 1>and victims.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A Cronenberg only has a few scenes that </v>

23
00:01:57.141 --> 00:02:00.080
<v Speaker 1>actually show that violence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think five in total,</v>

24
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.153
<v Speaker 1>but their presence saturates the rest of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the film and you're lingering memories </v>

25
00:02:05.031 --> 00:02:07.040
<v Speaker 1>of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but take the very first scene,</v>

26
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.530
<v Speaker 1>the throat slitting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way it's filmed.</v>

27
00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.560
<v Speaker 1>You're not allowed any distance from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>action.</v>

28
00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.450
<v Speaker 1>You're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're your own neck.</v>

29
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.433
<v Speaker 1>Feels sensitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your own hand feels like it's holding </v>

30
00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:18.613
<v Speaker 1>the knife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cronenberg is a genius at placing the </v>

31
00:02:20.931 --> 00:02:24.500
<v Speaker 1>audience in the middle of body on body </v>
<v Speaker 1>clashes like this one.</v>

32
00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.430
<v Speaker 1>The violence is literally embodied by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the viewer,</v>

33
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.710
<v Speaker 1>but before I get too far ahead of </v>
<v Speaker 1>myself,</v>

34
00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:31.573
<v Speaker 1>eastern promises tells the story of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>expatriate Russian mafia in London and </v>

35
00:02:36.141 --> 00:02:36.974
<v Speaker 1>the ripples that run through it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When a midwife played by Naomi Watts </v>

36
00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.270
<v Speaker 1>uncovers a diary with potentially </v>
<v Speaker 1>damaging evidence against the family.</v>

37
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.433
<v Speaker 1>Connected to this is the story of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nikolai played expertly by Viggo </v>

38
00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.580
<v Speaker 1>Mortensen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a driver slash thug who's ruthlessness,</v>

39
00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.200
<v Speaker 1>judgment and efficiency propels him up </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ranks of the crime organization.</v>

40
00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:58.453
<v Speaker 1>That organization and the Russian crime </v>
<v Speaker 1>world in general is evidenced on </v>

41
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.450
<v Speaker 1>individual members by tattoos that tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>the story of their lives and their rank,</v>

42
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.330
<v Speaker 1>emphasizing the real bodily relationship</v>
<v Speaker 1>between individuals and the group,</v>

43
00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.840
<v Speaker 1>and I have tattoos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't exist as well as a captain.</v>

44
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.913
<v Speaker 1>This body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this corpse who the audience knows was </v>

45
00:03:20.021 --> 00:03:23.170
<v Speaker 1>professionally processed by Nikolai </v>
<v Speaker 1>earlier in the film,</v>

46
00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.910
<v Speaker 1>sets up an interesting contrast because </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that processing.</v>

47
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.030
<v Speaker 1>The police can't identify the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual,</v>

48
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.180
<v Speaker 1>only that individual's rank and history </v>
<v Speaker 1>of crime,</v>

49
00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:35.693
<v Speaker 1>and here's an example of how </v>
<v Speaker 1>individuality is sacrificed to the </v>

50
00:03:38.381 --> 00:03:39.214
<v Speaker 1>collective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most groups and especially those that </v>

51
00:03:40.961 --> 00:03:41.794
<v Speaker 1>use violence as a means organized </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves around some kind of common </v>

52
00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:46.293
<v Speaker 1>ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some code or traditional escalate God </v>

53
00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:49.443
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never speak to anybody about you'll get </v>

54
00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:52.360
<v Speaker 1>sane individuals.</v>

55
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.193
<v Speaker 1>It's often hypothesize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>need a shared code like this to commit </v>

56
00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:01.270
<v Speaker 1>acts of cruelty because in a group those</v>
<v Speaker 1>acts can be attributed to the collective</v>

57
00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.193
<v Speaker 1>and it's goals and the individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have to face responsibility or </v>

58
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:06.633
<v Speaker 1>individuality is that I think this makes</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a paradox and the problem or the </v>

59
00:04:11.801 --> 00:04:16.600
<v Speaker 1>paradox is that collectives often ask </v>
<v Speaker 1>people to relinquish individuality,</v>

60
00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.150
<v Speaker 1>but the thing that defines individuality</v>
<v Speaker 1>and identity for so many people is their</v>

61
00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.520
<v Speaker 1>place within a collective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More on that in a moment.</v>

62
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:25.503
<v Speaker 1>The problem is that once a person </v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrifices part of his or her </v>

63
00:04:28.391 --> 00:04:29.224
<v Speaker 1>individuality to the group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the group can then sacrifice the </v>

64
00:04:32.411 --> 00:04:36.100
<v Speaker 1>individual Tatiana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pregnant woman from the beginning of</v>

65
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.140
<v Speaker 1>the film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's voiceover diary entries,</v>

66
00:04:38.141 --> 00:04:38.974
<v Speaker 1>hang like a specter over everything that</v>
<v Speaker 1>happens left Russia to find a better </v>

67
00:04:42.971 --> 00:04:45.760
<v Speaker 1>life in the multicultural collective of </v>
<v Speaker 1>London,</v>

68
00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:47.043
<v Speaker 1>but she was absorbed into a vicious </v>
<v Speaker 1>subgroup of that collective that </v>

69
00:04:49.991 --> 00:04:53.530
<v Speaker 1>sacrificed her individuality for its own</v>
<v Speaker 1>ends.</v>

70
00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.933
<v Speaker 1>Anna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the midwife wants to connect with her </v>

71
00:04:56.081 --> 00:04:56.914
<v Speaker 1>Russian heritage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she too brings herself within the </v>

72
00:04:58.781 --> 00:05:01.270
<v Speaker 1>orbit of the Mafia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Escaping.</v>

73
00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:02.223
<v Speaker 1>We're Tatiana could not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The head of the mafia son played by </v>

74
00:05:04.511 --> 00:05:09.430
<v Speaker 1>Vincent Cassel is genetically linked to </v>
<v Speaker 1>his fucking birthmark,</v>

75
00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:12.970
<v Speaker 1>which means he has to sacrifice his </v>
<v Speaker 1>homosexuality,</v>

76
00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.823
<v Speaker 1>his individual truth to an organization </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a culture that rejects such a </v>

77
00:05:17.831 --> 00:05:21.280
<v Speaker 1>lifestyle at the risk of being </v>
<v Speaker 1>ostracized or worse.</v>

78
00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:22.750
<v Speaker 1>It's worth noting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

79
00:05:22.751 --> 00:05:23.584
<v Speaker 1>that Cronenberg uses this case to </v>
<v Speaker 1>highlight the way men use their bodies </v>

80
00:05:27.041 --> 00:05:31.240
<v Speaker 1>to project masculinity real or fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

81
00:05:31.241 --> 00:05:32.074
<v Speaker 1>the major case study here is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nikolai Nikolai sacrifices himself to </v>

82
00:05:36.461 --> 00:05:37.294
<v Speaker 1>the Russian mafia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>made perfectly clear by the way he </v>

83
00:05:39.611 --> 00:05:40.444
<v Speaker 1>prefers his naked body to the group and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ritual almost eroticize scene in </v>

84
00:05:44.741 --> 00:05:48.670
<v Speaker 1>which he earns the star tattoos almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately after this.</v>

85
00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.570
<v Speaker 1>He learns the cost of that sacrifice </v>
<v Speaker 1>when he is betrayed.</v>

86
00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:03.410
<v Speaker 1>This isn't only one of the best scenes </v>
<v Speaker 1>in film history,</v>

87
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:05.150
<v Speaker 1>beautifully choreographed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>filmed,</v>

88
00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:09.560
<v Speaker 1>but it's the scene that brings all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Cronenberg's themes to a climax.</v>

89
00:06:09.561 --> 00:06:13.850
<v Speaker 1>This matrix of individual collective </v>
<v Speaker 1>body and violence.</v>

90
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:15.043
<v Speaker 1>Individuals subsumed in groups like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russian mafia or in a strange kind of </v>

91
00:06:18.981 --> 00:06:19.814
<v Speaker 1>crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The group doesn't so much demand the </v>

92
00:06:21.771 --> 00:06:22.604
<v Speaker 1>disillusion of individuality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but rather the maintenance of </v>

93
00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:29.510
<v Speaker 1>individuality that's always united with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the group's intentions.</v>

94
00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:32.390
<v Speaker 1>It's easy to see how paradoxical that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

95
00:06:32.391 --> 00:06:37.340
<v Speaker 1>How can individuals define themselves by</v>
<v Speaker 1>connection to an organization that makes</v>

96
00:06:37.341 --> 00:06:40.060
<v Speaker 1>them interchangeable in the bathhouse </v>
<v Speaker 1>seen,</v>

97
00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:44.150
<v Speaker 1>the Russian mob uses this </v>
<v Speaker 1>interchangeability to betray Nicholi,</v>

98
00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:48.080
<v Speaker 1>letting the Chechens identify him as </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone else by his tattoos.</v>

99
00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:49.163
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tattoos or a form of body </v>

100
00:06:50.181 --> 00:06:51.970
<v Speaker 1>manipulation that individuals like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nicole,</v>

101
00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:56.980
<v Speaker 1>I use to code this paradoxical identity </v>
<v Speaker 1>into reality to make it real.</v>

102
00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:58.263
<v Speaker 1>A Cronenberg and Mortenson have Nikolai </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight naked in order to show that by </v>

103
00:07:01.941 --> 00:07:02.774
<v Speaker 1>joining this group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not only individuality that's made </v>

104
00:07:05.121 --> 00:07:05.954
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the body itself and when it's </v>

105
00:07:08.331 --> 00:07:08.900
<v Speaker 1>revealed.</v>

106
00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:09.733
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Nikolai is actually an undercover </v>

107
00:07:11.841 --> 00:07:12.674
<v Speaker 1>agent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's these cuts and bruises that prove </v>

108
00:07:14.901 --> 00:07:17.570
<v Speaker 1>his devotion to another kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>collective,</v>

109
00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:18.733
<v Speaker 1>the police and realize his identity as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>hero who uses the rules of individuals </v>

110
00:07:23.541 --> 00:07:28.541
<v Speaker 1>and groups to his own advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cronenberg is a master filmmaker because</v>

111
00:07:29.451 --> 00:07:30.284
<v Speaker 1>he can use the elements of a crime genre</v>
<v Speaker 1>film written by someone else to </v>

112
00:07:34.371 --> 00:07:35.204
<v Speaker 1>interrogate these big themes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Human beings are individuals in </v>

113
00:07:39.411 --> 00:07:42.050
<v Speaker 1>collectives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they our minds and bodies,</v>

114
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:45.860
<v Speaker 1>they operate within ideas where blood is</v>
<v Speaker 1>symbolic,</v>

115
00:07:45.861 --> 00:07:46.694
<v Speaker 1>just a color or a bouquet of roses and </v>
<v Speaker 1>yet live in the physical world where </v>

116
00:07:50.961 --> 00:07:54.530
<v Speaker 1>blood can send you to jail or be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>last thing you ever see.</v>

117
00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:59.150
<v Speaker 1>Among these themes are paradoxes that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't resolve,</v>

118
00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:00.313
<v Speaker 1>but our body's exposed the truth that </v>
<v Speaker 1>David Cronenberg wants us to remember </v>

119
00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:09.310
<v Speaker 1>that we are all the victims and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>perpetrators of reality.</v>

130
00:08:38.781 --> 00:08:43.520
<v Speaker 1>an amazing director elevating a genre </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie to become something more than that</v>

131
00:08:43.521 --> 00:08:45.650
<v Speaker 1>by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the power of his directing,</v>

132
00:08:45.651 --> 00:08:48.650
<v Speaker 1>what he chooses to focus on and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>themes that he laces through it.</v>

133
00:08:48.651 --> 00:08:51.860
<v Speaker 1>So I love Cronenberg.</v>
