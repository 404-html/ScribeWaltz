1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.060
<v Speaker 1>They must goes into a podiatrist's </v>
<v Speaker 1>office and the podiatry side that says,</v>

2
00:00:05.221 --> 00:00:07.350
<v Speaker 1>what's the problem?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the mom says,</v>

3
00:00:07.351 --> 00:00:09.690
<v Speaker 1>what's the problem?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where do I begin?</v>

4
00:00:09.691 --> 00:00:10.524
<v Speaker 1>Man?</v>

5
00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:11.383
<v Speaker 2>Norm Mcdonald is one of those comedians </v>
<v Speaker 2>who functions as a litmus test for </v>

6
00:00:14.931 --> 00:00:18.290
<v Speaker 2>people's sense of humor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you find norm hilarious,</v>

7
00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.320
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that your sense of humor and mine</v>

8
00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:22.183
<v Speaker 2>are probably pretty similar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Norm splits people and if he does so </v>

9
00:00:25.191 --> 00:00:26.024
<v Speaker 2>more than most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's because his vision of </v>

10
00:00:27.741 --> 00:00:32.741
<v Speaker 2>comedy is unflinching unflinchingly </v>
<v Speaker 2>devoted to what he finds funny,</v>

11
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.010
<v Speaker 2>which means that he won't ever try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>modify his work to appease an audience.</v>

12
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:37.903
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this has led to what I think is the </v>

13
00:00:39.231 --> 00:00:40.064
<v Speaker 2>mistaken notion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one that you often see in youtube </v>

14
00:00:41.931 --> 00:00:45.320
<v Speaker 2>comments that norm just doesn't care </v>
<v Speaker 2>what people think</v>

15
00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.100
<v Speaker 1>because I go to work for a gregory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a linen,</v>

16
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.490
<v Speaker 1>which honestly I don't even know what </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing anymore.</v>

17
00:00:52.491 --> 00:00:54.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know if Gregory Olin </v>
<v Speaker 1>Yvette's knows.</v>

18
00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.720
<v Speaker 1>He only knows that he has power over me </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that seems to bring up</v>

19
00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:59.803
<v Speaker 2>in us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think norm cares deeply about his </v>

20
00:01:01.671 --> 00:01:02.504
<v Speaker 2>audiences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wouldn't spend thousands of hours </v>

21
00:01:04.131 --> 00:01:06.890
<v Speaker 2>honing his material if you didn't want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to make people laugh.</v>

22
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.220
<v Speaker 2>He just doesn't let the audience dictate</v>
<v Speaker 2>the direction of this work.</v>

23
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.110
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't pander.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

24
00:01:12.111 --> 00:01:15.110
<v Speaker 2>during his time at snl as the host of </v>
<v Speaker 2>weekend update,</v>

25
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:16.213
<v Speaker 2>he often did the exact opposite norms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>distaste for performing in front of an </v>

26
00:01:19.551 --> 00:01:22.010
<v Speaker 2>audience that was essentially forced to </v>
<v Speaker 2>laugh,</v>

27
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.540
<v Speaker 2>urged him to tell jokes that would shock</v>
<v Speaker 2>them into silence or gasps.</v>

28
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:27.463
<v Speaker 2>A decade before Ricky Gervais' made a </v>
<v Speaker 2>splash by making fun of celebrities at </v>

29
00:01:30.111 --> 00:01:33.530
<v Speaker 2>the Golden Globes norm hosted the sps </v>
<v Speaker 2>with jokes.</v>

30
00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.893
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>began the first defensive player to win </v>

31
00:01:36.201 --> 00:01:37.940
<v Speaker 1>the heisman trophy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and congratulations,</v>

32
00:01:37.941 --> 00:01:38.774
<v Speaker 1>Charles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is something that no one can ever </v>

33
00:01:40.851 --> 00:01:43.340
<v Speaker 1>take away from you unless you kill your </v>
<v Speaker 1>wife later,</v>

34
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.183
<v Speaker 1>in which case</v>

35
00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.380
<v Speaker 2>take bravery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It takes dedication.</v>

36
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.470
<v Speaker 1>At night I sometimes wake up and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>turned to some old lady in my bed that's</v>

37
00:01:56.281 --> 00:01:59.650
<v Speaker 1>on my arm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lady that I once loved duck.</v>

38
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where to turn to my </v>
<v Speaker 1>youngest Alexandria.</v>

39
00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.270
<v Speaker 1>She fell in the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the,</v>

40
00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.370
<v Speaker 1>in the cold of last year.</v>

41
00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:12.293
<v Speaker 2>Norms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dedication to the craft is almost </v>

42
00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.850
<v Speaker 2>inhuman and so much of it is unseen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's one of the smartest,</v>

43
00:02:17.851 --> 00:02:18.684
<v Speaker 2>well-read people in stand up </v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly well read in Russian </v>

44
00:02:20.671 --> 00:02:21.504
<v Speaker 2>literature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you couldn't tell by the names that </v>

45
00:02:22.711 --> 00:02:23.544
<v Speaker 2>he's making up in the mouth joke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and yet his whole act is predicated on </v>

46
00:02:26.761 --> 00:02:28.950
<v Speaker 2>this folksy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dopey innocence.</v>

47
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.090
<v Speaker 2>He's like that magician from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>prestige who devotes his whole life to a</v>

48
00:02:33.091 --> 00:02:35.550
<v Speaker 2>character just to pull off a great </v>
<v Speaker 2>trick.</v>

49
00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:36.120
<v Speaker 2>This</v>

50
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.953
<v Speaker 1>he's the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is one owner can detect this total </v>

51
00:02:42.721 --> 00:02:47.550
<v Speaker 1>devotion to his own self sacrifice at my</v>
<v Speaker 1>other boy.</v>

52
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.830
<v Speaker 1>This is the hardest pill to swallow my </v>
<v Speaker 1>after boy,</v>

53
00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.110
<v Speaker 1>Greg Arrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then a little</v>

54
00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.990
<v Speaker 2>I no longer love him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not trying to pull off tricks.</v>

55
00:03:07.991 --> 00:03:12.370
<v Speaker 2>Of course he's trying to pull off jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a joke with a premise and the punchline,</v>

56
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.310
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Norm was known for his super short jokes</v>

57
00:03:15.311 --> 00:03:16.144
<v Speaker 2>during this weekend update period and </v>
<v Speaker 2>now he's known for these super long </v>

58
00:03:18.941 --> 00:03:22.120
<v Speaker 2>rambling jokes that he often tells on </v>
<v Speaker 2>late show appearances.</v>

59
00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.193
<v Speaker 2>It's these longer jokes which bear a </v>
<v Speaker 2>resemblance to shaggy dog stories that </v>

60
00:03:26.981 --> 00:03:30.830
<v Speaker 2>often get him labeled as an anti comic </v>
<v Speaker 2>or a medical clinic,</v>

61
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.080
<v Speaker 2>but he strongly insists that he is </v>
<v Speaker 2>neither of these things in interviews.</v>

62
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.560
<v Speaker 2>Norm rejects anything that sees itself </v>
<v Speaker 2>as above comedy.</v>

63
00:03:38.561 --> 00:03:41.760
<v Speaker 2>Looking down on it either to ridicule or</v>
<v Speaker 2>to comment.</v>

64
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.400
<v Speaker 2>His jokes always have punchlines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Punchlines.</v>

65
00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.770
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whether or not you think they're funny,</v>

66
00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.160
<v Speaker 2>he can deliver a joke quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

67
00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.700
<v Speaker 2>you know the funniest part of doing an </v>
<v Speaker 2>office Congo line.</v>

68
00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:56.643
<v Speaker 2>When you look back and realize they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it alone and you're not in an </v>

69
00:04:00.221 --> 00:04:01.054
<v Speaker 2>office,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in a psychiatric hospital where </v>

70
00:04:03.431 --> 00:04:08.110
<v Speaker 2>he can string out punchlines like pearls</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a wire across a long story.</v>

71
00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.920
<v Speaker 2>This joke from his special me doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>standup is 12 minutes long.</v>

72
00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:16.120
<v Speaker 1>Seems like there's too much news because</v>
<v Speaker 1>now they have 24 hour news.</v>

73
00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.690
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was a young boy,</v>

74
00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.850
<v Speaker 1>the news was half a hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the whole.</v>

75
00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:20.713
<v Speaker 2>It starts by talking about 24 hour news </v>
<v Speaker 2>and eventually makes his way to a </v>

76
00:04:23.991 --> 00:04:28.160
<v Speaker 2>detailed description of how he would </v>
<v Speaker 2>murder someone and the progression.</v>

77
00:04:28.161 --> 00:04:29.120
<v Speaker 2>It's completely natural.</v>

78
00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.550
<v Speaker 1>I would take her body to the woods and </v>
<v Speaker 1>barrier in a very,</v>

79
00:04:34.551 --> 00:04:38.110
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very deep grave along the way.</v>

80
00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.980
<v Speaker 2>There was plenty of punchlines to laugh </v>
<v Speaker 2>at and as things get crazier,</v>

81
00:04:41.981 --> 00:04:43.720
<v Speaker 2>you get drawn into a kind of.</v>

82
00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.670
<v Speaker 1>A lady has vanished cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fat.</v>

83
00:04:46.671 --> 00:04:51.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm Kinda happy it's Janice and not </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody I know to meet her one day.</v>

84
00:04:51.471 --> 00:04:52.880
<v Speaker 1>That would be a lot of fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forgot.</v>

85
00:04:52.881 --> 00:04:57.881
<v Speaker 1>She vanished time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will find you in a shallow grave.</v>

86
00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.430
<v Speaker 1>Serial killers are supposed to be so </v>
<v Speaker 1>shrewd and cunning and you know,</v>

87
00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:06.800
<v Speaker 1>but then when it comes time for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>grave,</v>

88
00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:09.690
<v Speaker 1>it'll hasty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

89
00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:14.030
<v Speaker 1>what I would do is I would like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would look at the lay,</v>

90
00:05:14.031 --> 00:05:16.880
<v Speaker 1>I would select a lady and then I would </v>
<v Speaker 1>follow her habits.</v>

91
00:05:16.881 --> 00:05:17.714
<v Speaker 1>You understand what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would I be a holding in my right </v>

92
00:05:21.051 --> 00:05:23.990
<v Speaker 1>hand in the parking lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a cheese sandwich.</v>

93
00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:26.830
<v Speaker 1>I got a whole fucking van full of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

94
00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:31.970
<v Speaker 1>get in there and I would do that thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes me feel like God.</v>

95
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:37.230
<v Speaker 1>And then I would take her body to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>woods and barrier in a very,</v>

96
00:05:38.361 --> 00:05:40.490
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very deep brave,</v>

97
00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.540
<v Speaker 2>which is have this joke is there if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to look for it,</v>

98
00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.400
<v Speaker 2>the word choices,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the freezing.</v>

99
00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:48.493
<v Speaker 2>It's all precisely chosen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but norm doesn't call attention to his </v>

100
00:05:50.971 --> 00:05:51.804
<v Speaker 2>own intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The punchlines just appear like flashes </v>

101
00:05:54.451 --> 00:05:54.960
<v Speaker 2>of light.</v>

102
00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.960
<v Speaker 1>If only the cowardice was stronger than </v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps grabs I couldn't bring myself to</v>

103
00:06:01.681 --> 00:06:05.130
<v Speaker 1>reach over to that cocked and loaded gun</v>
<v Speaker 1>that lays on the bed.</v>

104
00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.660
<v Speaker 1>And then this hellish facade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one</v>

105
00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:15.960
<v Speaker 2>constellation of comedy greats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Norm is among the least famous,</v>

106
00:06:15.961 --> 00:06:18.120
<v Speaker 2>but he's also one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>underrated.</v>

107
00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:19.283
<v Speaker 2>That's because standup was never a </v>
<v Speaker 2>stepping stone for him to greater </v>

108
00:06:21.871 --> 00:06:25.140
<v Speaker 2>success or greater fame,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but an end in itself,</v>

109
00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:30.200
<v Speaker 2>an art to perfect is kind of comedy is </v>
<v Speaker 2>built to last like a low frequency noise</v>

110
00:06:30.871 --> 00:06:34.950
<v Speaker 2>that might not demand the same kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention is high pitch sounds,</v>

111
00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:38.100
<v Speaker 2>but we'll travel a much greater distance</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the end.</v>

112
00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:41.610
<v Speaker 2>Enormous jokes are the ones you'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>remember latent to your life.</v>

113
00:06:41.611 --> 00:06:42.444
<v Speaker 2>The ones will all be telling for years </v>
<v Speaker 2>to come because they're construction is </v>

114
00:06:45.721 --> 00:06:46.554
<v Speaker 2>sophisticated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but their delivery is easy to </v>

115
00:06:48.451 --> 00:06:49.284
<v Speaker 2>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Getting that balance exactly right is </v>

116
