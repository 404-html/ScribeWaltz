00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.833
<v Speaker 1>Hello,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all you vagrants and vagaries coffee on </v>

2
00:00:02.131 --> 00:00:07.131
<v Speaker 1>a Tuesday and Vlog 57.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3
00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.210
<v Speaker 1>we have to put this Tuesday thing to bed</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you guys always comment,</v>

4
00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:13.550
<v Speaker 1>but you don't release on a Tuesday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the deal with that?</v>

5
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.960
<v Speaker 1>The truth is I don't film on a Tuesday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't write on a Tuesday.</v>

6
00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.153
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I edit on Tuesday and I most </v>
<v Speaker 1>usually don't release on a Tuesday </v>

7
00:00:22.281 --> 00:00:23.114
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just sort of become this running </v>

8
00:00:24.171 --> 00:00:25.370
<v Speaker 1>joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I sometimes think,</v>

9
00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Tuesday somewhere,</v>

10
00:00:27.021 --> 00:00:27.854
<v Speaker 1>but then I realized that doesn't make </v>
<v Speaker 1>any sense and then I think I just liked </v>

11
00:00:32.541 --> 00:00:33.374
<v Speaker 1>the way it sounds.</v>

12
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.610
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

13
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.860
<v Speaker 1>Rem Koolhaas in his famous delirious New</v>
<v Speaker 1>York writes,</v>

14
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:43.713
<v Speaker 1>the metropolis strives to reach a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mythical point where the world is </v>

15
00:00:46.431 --> 00:00:51.431
<v Speaker 1>completely fabricated by man so that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely coincides with his desires.</v>

16
00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:53.930
<v Speaker 1>You're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's true here.</v>

17
00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:54.793
<v Speaker 1>All geometries are achingly formal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even the parks and public gardens fits </v>

18
00:00:58.451 --> 00:01:02.420
<v Speaker 1>snugly into the parallelograms that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>streets and avenues draw.</v>

19
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.920
<v Speaker 1>Anything you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can have.</v>

20
00:01:03.921 --> 00:01:06.950
<v Speaker 1>The metropolis is made for consumption,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leisure,</v>

21
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.963
<v Speaker 1>ease of travel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It compliments and encourages that </v>

22
00:01:09.951 --> 00:01:14.030
<v Speaker 1>profound pulp fiction novel truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that after 1920,</v>

23
00:01:14.031 --> 00:01:17.560
<v Speaker 1>the whole world became about Saturday </v>
<v Speaker 1>night getting set</v>

24
00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:18.703
<v Speaker 3>in this round.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Each player has only one minute to </v>

25
00:01:20.721 --> 00:01:21.554
<v Speaker 3>retrieve a woman's phone number.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's see how our players perform at </v>

26
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.250
<v Speaker 3>speed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What of</v>

27
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.750
<v Speaker 1>the inevitability is about this city and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all cities,</v>

28
00:01:28.751 --> 00:01:33.751
<v Speaker 1>I suspect is that as you consume it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it consumes you and it fills you up with</v>

29
00:01:34.181 --> 00:01:36.790
<v Speaker 1>its own self.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To the exclusion of all else,</v>

30
00:01:36.791 --> 00:01:37.624
<v Speaker 1>man hadn't is the perfect metaphor for </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself because it's literally an island </v>

31
00:01:40.961 --> 00:01:44.770
<v Speaker 1>and if it all of a sudden broke off and </v>
<v Speaker 1>float it out into the Atlantic,</v>

32
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.200
<v Speaker 1>it's unclear how many of us would really</v>
<v Speaker 1>mine.</v>

33
00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.140
<v Speaker 1>Of course we'd have to take Brooklyn in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tow.</v>

34
00:01:50.141 --> 00:01:50.974
<v Speaker 1>Cities are designed in a very insular </v>
<v Speaker 1>way to obscure the world outside their </v>

35
00:01:54.401 --> 00:01:55.234
<v Speaker 1>walls from the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can only see a few blocks in every </v>

36
00:01:57.341 --> 00:02:00.490
<v Speaker 1>direction and the city just recedes into</v>
<v Speaker 1>more city.</v>

37
00:02:00.491 --> 00:02:01.324
<v Speaker 1>Its residence in this way worship the </v>
<v Speaker 1>present moment in salvos of anxiety and </v>

38
00:02:06.101 --> 00:02:06.934
<v Speaker 1>pleasure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in that worship and within these </v>

39
00:02:08.081 --> 00:02:11.350
<v Speaker 1>geometric towers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is no anchor to the outside world.</v>

40
00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:12.213
<v Speaker 1>No frame of reference in time spins out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of control like how in the lack of </v>

41
00:02:16.301 --> 00:02:17.134
<v Speaker 1>properly defined seasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Los Angeles skips from year to year </v>

42
00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.350
<v Speaker 1>without remark and in the absence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure,</v>

43
00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:24.303
<v Speaker 1>a relativism takes hold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A feeling of an Omi sits heavily on the </v>

44
00:02:28.451 --> 00:02:29.284
<v Speaker 1>salt and Omi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lack of social or ethical standards </v>

45
00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:32.463
<v Speaker 1>in an individual or group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As God dies and the great cities are </v>

46
00:02:36.281 --> 00:02:37.114
<v Speaker 1>born and Omi is the keynote of the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we wait for the harvest of a </v>

47
00:02:41.231 --> 00:02:43.090
<v Speaker 1>godless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>relativistic morality.</v>

48
00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.983
<v Speaker 1>Last Friday was the full moon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I came out of the subway and was </v>

49
00:02:47.051 --> 00:02:51.640
<v Speaker 1>transfixed as transfixed as if I had </v>
<v Speaker 1>seen an intruder in my home.</v>

50
00:02:51.641 --> 00:02:52.474
<v Speaker 1>It hung there brightly indifferently </v>
<v Speaker 1>shining and observing the comings and </v>

51
00:02:56.291 --> 00:02:57.124
<v Speaker 1>goings of all the harried city dwellers </v>
<v Speaker 1>as the culture around them decayed and </v>

52
00:03:01.031 --> 00:03:04.640
<v Speaker 1>advanced at just the same right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was reminded of the night a stall,</v>

53
00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.210
<v Speaker 1>foes brief sojourn to the moon in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>stoves.</v>

54
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:11.980
<v Speaker 1>Famous Orlando Furioso were searching </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a cure to Orlando's madness.</v>

55
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.963
<v Speaker 1>The night comes upon that valley where </v>
<v Speaker 1>all last things on earth are found deep </v>

56
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.850
<v Speaker 1>in a veil conducted by his guide where </v>
<v Speaker 1>Rosa Mountain steep on either side.</v>

57
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.940
<v Speaker 1>He came and saw a wonder to relate </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever was wasted in our earthly state</v>

58
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.160
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>safely treasured each neglected,</v>

59
00:03:30.161 --> 00:03:33.140
<v Speaker 1>good time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>squandered or occasion it'll bestowed,</v>

60
00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.013
<v Speaker 1>not only here our wealth inceptors found</v>
<v Speaker 1>that everchanging shift the unsteady </v>

61
00:03:38.681 --> 00:03:39.514
<v Speaker 1>round,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but those possessions while on Earth we </v>

62
00:03:41.621 --> 00:03:45.670
<v Speaker 1>live which fortunes hand can neither </v>
<v Speaker 1>take nor give much.</v>

63
00:03:45.671 --> 00:03:50.500
<v Speaker 1>Fame is there which here the creeping </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours consume till time at length.</v>

64
00:03:50.501 --> 00:03:54.880
<v Speaker 1>The whole devours their vows and their </v>
<v Speaker 1>unnumbered prayers remain,</v>

65
00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.550
<v Speaker 1>which often God the center makes in </v>
<v Speaker 1>vain.</v>

66
00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.350
<v Speaker 1>The frequent tiers that lover's eyes </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffuse the size they breed.</v>

67
00:04:02.351 --> 00:04:03.184
<v Speaker 1>The days that gamesters lose the leisure</v>
<v Speaker 1>given which fools so often neglect the </v>

68
00:04:07.841 --> 00:04:10.330
<v Speaker 1>week designs that never take effect.</v>

69
00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:11.163
<v Speaker 1>Whatever designs the mortal breasts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sale in countless numbers filled the </v>

70
00:04:15.131 --> 00:04:19.660
<v Speaker 1>uncovered vale for whatever is lost by </v>
<v Speaker 1>humankind.</v>

71
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.960
<v Speaker 1>Ascending here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you treasured safe may find.</v>

72
00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.823
<v Speaker 1>And then I wondered if a [inaudible] saw</v>
<v Speaker 1>the long lost tenants of common law or </v>

73
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.033
<v Speaker 1>under some garland chance to find the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sea cast fragments of unquiet mind </v>

74
00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:34.323
<v Speaker 1>discarded like flattery's proffer toward</v>
<v Speaker 1>that bone white kingdom without a lord </v>

75
00:04:39.041 --> 00:04:39.874
<v Speaker 1>as a fool to a stranger's care consigns </v>
<v Speaker 1>his own children and foremost rhymes </v>

76
00:04:44.741 --> 00:04:45.574
<v Speaker 1>would the night please with Orlando's </v>
<v Speaker 1>vial on his chariot span the starlit </v>

77
00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:51.183
<v Speaker 1>aisle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and bring to those who cast off and </v>

78
00:04:53.171 --> 00:04:56.710
<v Speaker 1>forgot the essence of this urban </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought.</v>
