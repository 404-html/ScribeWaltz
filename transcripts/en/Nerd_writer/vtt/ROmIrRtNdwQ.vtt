00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.790
<v Speaker 1>Hello and welcome to the nerd writer </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast movie review edition.</v>

2
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.400
<v Speaker 1>This is the first podcast that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>attempting to do.</v>

3
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.300
<v Speaker 1>I love podcasts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love listening to them.</v>

4
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.310
<v Speaker 1>I just think there's something special </v>
<v Speaker 1>about them.</v>

5
00:00:17.311 --> 00:00:21.120
<v Speaker 1>I love audio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love really great audio love listening</v>

6
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.240
<v Speaker 1>to the human voice when it's nice </v>
<v Speaker 1>clothes.</v>

7
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.230
<v Speaker 1>Nice and close to a really good mic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to try a podcast here.</v>

8
00:00:28.231 --> 00:00:31.620
<v Speaker 1>I just got out of the movie looper and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to talk about that today.</v>

9
00:00:31.621 --> 00:00:35.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to do percentages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can do rotten tomatoes for that.</v>

10
00:00:35.521 --> 00:00:37.710
<v Speaker 1>Not going to do stars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can do Roger Ebert for that.</v>

11
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.873
<v Speaker 1>I just want to talk about the movie and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that I do have the </v>

12
00:00:42.541 --> 00:00:45.000
<v Speaker 1>qualifications to talk about movies </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I was a film student.</v>

13
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.180
<v Speaker 1>I know a little bit about what goes into</v>
<v Speaker 1>making a movie.</v>

14
00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:50.400
<v Speaker 1>I've tried writing short films.</v>

15
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.690
<v Speaker 1>I even tried a getting my hand trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do a feature a couple of years ago.</v>

16
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.600
<v Speaker 1>It didn't work out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I at least know what it takes,</v>

17
00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.810
<v Speaker 1>so I have all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Much more respect for Ryan Johnson,</v>

18
00:01:00.811 --> 00:01:05.811
<v Speaker 1>the director of looper and writer who </v>
<v Speaker 1>composed this time travel story.</v>

19
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:07.920
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I want to mention before I start,</v>

20
00:01:07.921 --> 00:01:11.610
<v Speaker 1>I haven't read anything about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen any reviews,</v>

21
00:01:11.611 --> 00:01:12.444
<v Speaker 1>haven't read any reviews.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what rotten tomatoes even </v>

22
00:01:13.891 --> 00:01:15.000
<v Speaker 1>gave it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is strange for me.</v>

23
00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:15.834
<v Speaker 1>I usually always check before I go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what some friends have said and </v>

24
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.250
<v Speaker 1>the reviews have been in the all in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>range of good,</v>

25
00:01:23.251 --> 00:01:25.260
<v Speaker 1>some really good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some great,</v>

26
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.860
<v Speaker 1>some luke warm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but still mostly positive,</v>

27
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:34.020
<v Speaker 1>so I really enjoyed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a great time watching the movie,</v>

28
00:01:34.021 --> 00:01:36.270
<v Speaker 1>the experience of watching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a lot of fun.</v>

29
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.103
<v Speaker 1>The first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first half hour to an hour of the </v>

30
00:01:39.151 --> 00:01:43.380
<v Speaker 1>movie I thought was just flawless </v>
<v Speaker 1>storytelling really quick.</v>

31
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.780
<v Speaker 1>Getting all the information out there </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you need.</v>

32
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.560
<v Speaker 1>The world that they're living in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty,</v>

33
00:01:49.561 --> 00:01:54.360
<v Speaker 1>44 is explained in the process of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

34
00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.313
<v Speaker 1>Future movies that are set in the future</v>
<v Speaker 1>can sometimes get caught up in </v>

35
00:01:58.021 --> 00:02:00.090
<v Speaker 1>explaining the world that they're living</v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

36
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that looper falls into </v>
<v Speaker 1>that trap.</v>

37
00:02:04.381 --> 00:02:05.214
<v Speaker 1>I think that the elements of the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the future technologies that you're </v>

38
00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.380
<v Speaker 1>showing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way that the world is,</v>

39
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:11.603
<v Speaker 1>are done as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as sort of a side glance to the story </v>

40
00:02:15.931 --> 00:02:16.764
<v Speaker 1>proper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that the world is very </v>

41
00:02:18.691 --> 00:02:19.524
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a few sort of technological </v>

42
00:02:20.671 --> 00:02:22.980
<v Speaker 1>changes that you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that you might expect.</v>

43
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.843
<v Speaker 1>Nothing too ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also you get the sense that this is </v>

44
00:02:27.661 --> 00:02:29.730
<v Speaker 1>a dystopian future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The 20,</v>

45
00:02:29.731 --> 00:02:34.731
<v Speaker 1>44 of this world is something has gone </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong in the period of time in between.</v>

46
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.740
<v Speaker 1>And maybe it's something terrible has </v>
<v Speaker 1>gone wrong.</v>

47
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:38.623
<v Speaker 1>They've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they make one reference to the </v>

48
00:02:39.511 --> 00:02:40.344
<v Speaker 1>vagrant raids of the something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something so governments or the ability </v>

49
00:02:45.061 --> 00:02:50.061
<v Speaker 1>to police whatever city that this story </v>
<v Speaker 1>is set in a sort of broken down a little</v>

50
00:02:50.101 --> 00:02:53.130
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seems like the crime bosses have control</v>

51
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.770
<v Speaker 1>of the town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are getting shot,</v>

52
00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:56.813
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out near buses for whatever reason </v>

53
00:02:59.591 --> 00:03:01.750
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to steal something.</v>

54
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.093
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's not a place that you'd maybe </v>

55
00:03:04.541 --> 00:03:08.860
<v Speaker 1>want to live unless that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were a looper.</v>

56
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.520
<v Speaker 1>And I think that the character of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>loopers very interesting.</v>

57
00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.690
<v Speaker 1>And I'm realizing things as I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I just thinking about this movie,</v>

58
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:17.553
<v Speaker 1>having seen it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is going to happen in the </v>

59
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.730
<v Speaker 1>next couple of days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I,</v>

60
00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:21.563
<v Speaker 1>which is a mark of a good movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things is that these loopers </v>

61
00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.660
<v Speaker 1>are people who are not really thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about their future,</v>

62
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.470
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

63
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.470
<v Speaker 1>They go to the same bar every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get paid for their job,</v>

64
00:03:35.021 --> 00:03:39.310
<v Speaker 1>killing people from the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're doing the same drugs.</v>

65
00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.800
<v Speaker 1>You know when I was for those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for those of us went to college,</v>

66
00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:43.503
<v Speaker 1>I used to call this the haze.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just do the same things over and </v>

67
00:03:46.241 --> 00:03:51.241
<v Speaker 1>over again and it felt like frankly a </v>
<v Speaker 1>loop right the same night,</v>

68
00:03:51.251 --> 00:03:54.880
<v Speaker 1>the same weekend over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You lose track of time.</v>

69
00:03:54.881 --> 00:03:55.714
<v Speaker 1>You lose track of yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that is something that the </v>

70
00:03:57.161 --> 00:03:59.260
<v Speaker 1>loopers in this movie are definitely </v>
<v Speaker 1>going through,</v>

71
00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:04.410
<v Speaker 1>symbolized by the fact that one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>key elements is something called closing</v>

72
00:04:04.781 --> 00:04:05.614
<v Speaker 1>the loop where the bosses in the future </v>
<v Speaker 1>of somehow deemed it cleaning their own </v>

73
00:04:09.701 --> 00:04:14.701
<v Speaker 1>hands of loose ends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've sent back these kid loopers when</v>

74
00:04:14.891 --> 00:04:15.724
<v Speaker 1>they're older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 years in the future to kill </v>

75
00:04:16.571 --> 00:04:17.404
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know that it's going to be </v>

76
00:04:18.161 --> 00:04:22.480
<v Speaker 1>them because they're bagged on the head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but these kids,</v>

77
00:04:22.481 --> 00:04:25.510
<v Speaker 1>these loopers don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they really don't have a future.</v>

78
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.860
<v Speaker 1>They have 30 years and that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a layer there.</v>

79
00:04:29.861 --> 00:04:30.694
<v Speaker 1>There's a subtext there of are these </v>
<v Speaker 1>people's lives anything more than what </v>

80
00:04:34.721 --> 00:04:35.554
<v Speaker 1>they do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The montage in the beginning does a lot </v>

81
00:04:36.881 --> 00:04:38.140
<v Speaker 1>of that for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

82
00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.240
<v Speaker 1>and the way that the drug,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

83
00:04:40.241 --> 00:04:42.490
<v Speaker 1>this drop in your eyes filmed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just really,</v>

84
00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:43.353
<v Speaker 1>really stylistic and smart and I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is something that is shown </v>

85
00:04:46.211 --> 00:04:47.950
<v Speaker 1>throughout the whole movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But moving on.</v>

86
00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:49.043
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I probably should mention there's </v>

87
00:04:49.751 --> 00:04:51.700
<v Speaker 1>going to be spoilers in this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you haven't seen it,</v>

88
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.670
<v Speaker 1>I'd say stop listening right now and go </v>
<v Speaker 1>out and see it.</v>

89
00:04:54.671 --> 00:04:59.671
<v Speaker 1>It is worth your money to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so things start to get a little bit more</v>

90
00:04:59.711 --> 00:05:01.030
<v Speaker 1>intense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more serious.</v>

91
00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.500
<v Speaker 1>When Joseph [inaudible] character played</v>
<v Speaker 1>by Bruce will lets his future self comes</v>

92
00:05:05.501 --> 00:05:06.334
<v Speaker 1>back to the past and they show in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>montage of the years intervening what </v>

93
00:05:10.451 --> 00:05:11.150
<v Speaker 1>happens to him.</v>

94
00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.690
<v Speaker 1>He goes to China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does some more killing,</v>

95
00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:19.140
<v Speaker 1>but then eventually falls in love with </v>
<v Speaker 1>this Asian woman who he says saves some,</v>

96
00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:20.763
<v Speaker 1>saves them from this life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there's potentially troubling thing </v>

97
00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:24.753
<v Speaker 1>in this to begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the fact that Joseph Horne </v>

98
00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:31.110
<v Speaker 1>Levitt is a murderer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's murdered people who he doesn't know</v>

99
00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:32.673
<v Speaker 1>that they've done something bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if we cited that murdering people </v>

100
00:05:35.391 --> 00:05:36.224
<v Speaker 1>was okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't know that it doesn't mean </v>

101
00:05:37.551 --> 00:05:38.384
<v Speaker 1>bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just taking.</v>

102
00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:39.603
<v Speaker 1>He's taking the word of the bosses in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the future that they want them dead so </v>

103
00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:44.260
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

104
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.330
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard already to sympathize with him</v>

105
00:05:46.331 --> 00:05:49.120
<v Speaker 1>in the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That will become much,</v>

106
00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.540
<v Speaker 1>much harder for the Bruce Willis </v>
<v Speaker 1>character later in the movie,</v>

107
00:05:52.541 --> 00:05:53.374
<v Speaker 1>but we'll get to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The main criticism I have with time </v>

108
00:05:57.561 --> 00:06:01.040
<v Speaker 1>travel movies and this movie is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on what the movie is,</v>

109
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:02.630
<v Speaker 1>you can sort of get a sense.</v>

110
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:03.643
<v Speaker 1>You get the feeling towards the end that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the movie is trying to figure itself </v>

111
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:09.880
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Time travel.</v>

112
00:06:09.881 --> 00:06:10.714
<v Speaker 1>Movies are so much about the writing of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them is so much about closing all the </v>

113
00:06:13.281 --> 00:06:14.510
<v Speaker 1>loop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the loose ends,</v>

114
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.940
<v Speaker 1>making sure that it logical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it works right,</v>

115
00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.750
<v Speaker 1>especially ones that are explicitly </v>
<v Speaker 1>about time travel,</v>

116
00:06:20.751 --> 00:06:21.531
<v Speaker 1>like Lupron.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now of course,</v>

117
00:06:21.531 --> 00:06:25.370
<v Speaker 1>you can't close out every loose end with</v>
<v Speaker 1>time travel movies.</v>

118
00:06:25.371 --> 00:06:27.470
<v Speaker 1>We always take things for granted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

119
00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:28.453
<v Speaker 1>we know that it's not logical that only </v>
<v Speaker 1>small things would change for the </v>

120
00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:37.010
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bruce Willis,</v>

121
00:06:37.011 --> 00:06:40.460
<v Speaker 1>when little things change in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>presence of the movie,</v>

122
00:06:40.461 --> 00:06:41.294
<v Speaker 1>when he cuts his arm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know that little moments in the </v>

123
00:06:43.821 --> 00:06:44.654
<v Speaker 1>future affect big consequences or </v>
<v Speaker 1>lithium is in the president effect big </v>

124
00:06:48.561 --> 00:06:50.070
<v Speaker 1>consequences in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

125
00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.230
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the butterfly effect,</v>

126
00:06:51.231 --> 00:06:54.410
<v Speaker 1>the chaos effects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all of these things being at being at</v>

127
00:06:54.411 --> 00:06:55.244
<v Speaker 1>that bar to meet that Asian woman who </v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually marries those things don't </v>

128
00:06:57.471 --> 00:06:58.340
<v Speaker 1>happen after.</v>

129
00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:02.710
<v Speaker 1>It's a little thing like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a small misstep in the,</v>

130
00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:03.920
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in another direction.</v>

131
00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:05.390
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>

132
00:07:05.391 --> 00:07:07.280
<v Speaker 1>But we let those things go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And time travel movies,</v>

133
00:07:07.281 --> 00:07:08.114
<v Speaker 1>because if we didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we wouldn't be able to have time travel </v>

134
00:07:10.791 --> 00:07:12.230
<v Speaker 1>movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just wouldn't work.</v>

135
00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:13.273
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm back to the future of great time </v>

136
00:07:15.081 --> 00:07:18.350
<v Speaker 1>travel movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The the picture disappearing thing is,</v>

137
00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:19.243
<v Speaker 1>you know when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when when their existence becomes </v>

138
00:07:20.451 --> 00:07:21.980
<v Speaker 1>questionable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they disappear in the picture.</v>

139
00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:23.023
<v Speaker 1>That is ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because it's like it goes from the </v>

140
00:07:25.221 --> 00:07:28.470
<v Speaker 1>head goes from the head down to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

141
00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:30.530
<v Speaker 1>the feet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last thing that they have.</v>

142
00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:31.473
<v Speaker 1>That's just ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we let it go because we know that </v>

143
00:07:34.041 --> 00:07:37.640
<v Speaker 1>some liberties have to be taken and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a good example that these two movies are</v>

144
00:07:37.641 --> 00:07:38.474
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are good to compare against each other </v>

145
00:07:39.201 --> 00:07:40.034
<v Speaker 1>because the time travel elements in back</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the future are very campy to begin </v>

146
00:07:43.251 --> 00:07:44.084
<v Speaker 1>with and it's a very campy movie and </v>
<v Speaker 1>back to the future spends a lot of time </v>

147
00:07:46.911 --> 00:07:50.630
<v Speaker 1>on the character and the story in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>past.</v>

148
00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.600
<v Speaker 1>Have Marty and the parents and all that </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

149
00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:56.540
<v Speaker 1>Even though time travel is the wrapping </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is all around it.</v>

150
00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:01.370
<v Speaker 1>Looper is one of these movies in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>line of inception,</v>

151
00:08:01.371 --> 00:08:02.204
<v Speaker 1>dark knight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Chris Nolan type of movies where </v>

152
00:08:03.441 --> 00:08:05.990
<v Speaker 1>everything has to be sort of airtight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watertight,</v>

153
00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:08.960
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is really realistic.</v>

154
00:08:08.961 --> 00:08:11.060
<v Speaker 1>This is what would happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is how it would be.</v>

155
00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:12.643
<v Speaker 1>My main criticism of looper and in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>vein is that you feel at the end of the </v>

156
00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:18.613
<v Speaker 1>movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time travel elements of the story </v>

157
00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.850
<v Speaker 1>spinning themselves to their proper </v>
<v Speaker 1>conclusion,</v>

158
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:26.540
<v Speaker 1>and that for me takes away from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>character development,</v>

159
00:08:26.541 --> 00:08:31.541
<v Speaker 1>which which for a great movie is always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>always the center of the story.</v>

160
00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:34.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm not to say that there aren't great </v>
<v Speaker 1>characters in this movie.</v>

161
00:08:34.911 --> 00:08:39.140
<v Speaker 1>I think that Joseph Gordon Levitt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bruce Willis a and emily blunt,</v>

162
00:08:39.141 --> 00:08:41.150
<v Speaker 1>do great acting jobs for their </v>
<v Speaker 1>characters,</v>

163
00:08:41.151 --> 00:08:44.540
<v Speaker 1>but there are a few things that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>go wonky in the third act first,</v>

164
00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:45.583
<v Speaker 1>when Bruce Willis kills that kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever sympathy you had for him </v>

165
00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:51.170
<v Speaker 1>immediately goes what we know from Ryan </v>
<v Speaker 1>Johnson,</v>

166
00:08:51.171 --> 00:08:56.100
<v Speaker 1>the director's choice early on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the fact that he doesn't show Elma,</v>

167
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.220
<v Speaker 1>emily blunt's child's face the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>three times we see him.</v>

168
00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:02.610
<v Speaker 1>We know that he's the rainmaker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's something that I don't think he's</v>

169
00:09:02.611 --> 00:09:04.460
<v Speaker 1>trying to hide from us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

170
00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:05.933
<v Speaker 1>and the fact that we know that means </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the first kid that Bruceville's </v>

171
00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:10.303
<v Speaker 1>skills is an innocent child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even though he feels remorse about </v>

172
00:09:13.501 --> 00:09:14.334
<v Speaker 1>it afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard for us to sympathize with </v>

173
00:09:16.771 --> 00:09:17.604
<v Speaker 1>Bruceville's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

174
00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:18.773
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's Ryan will ryan or</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ryan Johnson's attention for us </v>

175
00:09:21.361 --> 00:09:23.670
<v Speaker 1>sympathize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we don't do it after that.</v>

176
00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:25.470
<v Speaker 1>Excuse me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Taking a drink here.</v>

177
00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:32.420
<v Speaker 1>And then we have that almost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What essentially is Bruce Willis becomes</v>

178
00:09:34.141 --> 00:09:34.974
<v Speaker 1>John mcclane from die hard and starts </v>
<v Speaker 1>ripping people apart with machine guns </v>

179
00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:40.553
<v Speaker 1>and semiautomatic guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just killing scores and scores of </v>

180
00:09:42.871 --> 00:09:43.710
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy,</v>

181
00:09:43.711 --> 00:09:46.860
<v Speaker 1>his last two are empathetic urges,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

182
00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:47.723
<v Speaker 1>He can't get what he wants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You cannot build a love so strong to </v>

183
00:09:52.531 --> 00:09:56.760
<v Speaker 1>justify for the viewer the murder that </v>
<v Speaker 1>he commits in the end of that movie.</v>

184
00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:57.280
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

185
00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:58.113
<v Speaker 1>like I said before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's already hard with Joseph Gordon </v>

186
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:02.131
<v Speaker 1>Levitt character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

187
00:10:02.131 --> 00:10:02.964
<v Speaker 1>and one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way that I mentioned that I had </v>

188
00:10:04.471 --> 00:10:08.190
<v Speaker 1>noticed that I don't think the person </v>
<v Speaker 1>who was watching it with notice,</v>

189
00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:09.263
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I thought was interesting little </v>

190
00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:11.003
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

191
00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:11.963
<v Speaker 1>so the punk kid who's got the Gat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who really shouldn't be allowed to have </v>

192
00:10:15.241 --> 00:10:16.740
<v Speaker 1>any kind of gun because he is </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous.</v>

193
00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:20.940
<v Speaker 1>That's Jeff Daniels from the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

194
00:10:20.941 --> 00:10:24.300
<v Speaker 1>from the president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's Jeff Daniels past self.</v>

195
00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:25.583
<v Speaker 1>I think the way that you can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way that I noticed it was when Jeff </v>

196
00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:29.940
<v Speaker 1>Daniels died and he's sort of looking at</v>
<v Speaker 1>him really sad.</v>

197
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.360
<v Speaker 1>The next thing he sees on the wall is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the map where Joseph Gordon Levitt is,</v>

198
00:10:33.361 --> 00:10:34.194
<v Speaker 1>and there's a circle on the map and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that is supposed to symbolize </v>

199
00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:38.490
<v Speaker 1>closing the loop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

200
00:10:38.491 --> 00:10:39.840
<v Speaker 1>well done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ryan Johnson on that.</v>

201
00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:41.070
<v Speaker 1>That was a good little moment.</v>

202
00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:42.960
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm reading about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could be wrong.</v>

203
00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:44.003
<v Speaker 1>So when Joseph Gordon Levitt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kills himself in the end and is able to </v>

204
00:10:47.941 --> 00:10:50.720
<v Speaker 1>change the rainmakers future to become </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

205
00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:52.560
<v Speaker 1>presumably he's going to become good </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

206
00:10:52.561 --> 00:10:54.480
<v Speaker 1>Whatever him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The process,</v>

207
00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:54.951
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

208
00:10:54.951 --> 00:10:58.530
<v Speaker 1>the moment of him killing himself to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>felt unsatisfying.</v>

209
00:10:58.531 --> 00:10:59.364
<v Speaker 1>The reason was because I felt the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>travel elements overshadowing the </v>

210
00:11:03.361 --> 00:11:04.194
<v Speaker 1>character elements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There had to be an end to this story </v>

211
00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:07.913
<v Speaker 1>that worked for eight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A fallen character like Joseph Gordon </v>

212
00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:13.073
<v Speaker 1>Levitt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>killing yourself is really the only way </v>

213
00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:15.600
<v Speaker 1>to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all.</v>

214
00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:17.850
<v Speaker 1>So you already have that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Second of all,</v>

215
00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:19.560
<v Speaker 1>what happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

216
00:11:19.561 --> 00:11:23.370
<v Speaker 1>Bruce Willis cannot be made to get back </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the Asian woman.</v>

217
00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:24.233
<v Speaker 1>His wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joseph Levitt isn't going to go on to </v>

218
00:11:25.471 --> 00:11:28.950
<v Speaker 1>live with emily blunt and the kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

219
00:11:28.951 --> 00:11:32.130
<v Speaker 1>So this is really the only ending of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie that there could be.</v>

220
00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:36.990
<v Speaker 1>And there are a lot of really great </v>
<v Speaker 1>movies I should mention that have fallen</v>

221
00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:39.300
<v Speaker 1>characters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lowlife characters,</v>

222
00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:40.403
<v Speaker 1>but it's broadcast very early on about </v>
<v Speaker 1>those characters that they won't make </v>

223
00:11:43.771 --> 00:11:44.580
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

224
00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:47.400
<v Speaker 1>And you know it a good distance from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>end.</v>

225
00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:49.980
<v Speaker 1>The fact that Ryan Johnson tries to keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>us in suspense,</v>

226
00:11:49.981 --> 00:11:51.780
<v Speaker 1>like maybe Joseph Gordon Levitt might </v>
<v Speaker 1>make it,</v>

227
00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:55.750
<v Speaker 1>I think actually takes away from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie because it would be a sort of.</v>

228
00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:58.720
<v Speaker 1>I think it just would be an empty </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling if he got to live.</v>

229
00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:01.090
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the trap the movie gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>into.</v>

230
00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:03.490
<v Speaker 1>It would be an empty feeling for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>viewer.</v>

231
00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:04.353
<v Speaker 1>If he got to live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to redeem that kind of </v>

232
00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:06.843
<v Speaker 1>character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't make him a tragic </v>

233
00:12:09.671 --> 00:12:11.860
<v Speaker 1>character early on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>early enough in the movie.</v>

234
00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:14.350
<v Speaker 1>So you're sort of vacillating between </v>
<v Speaker 1>the two sides.</v>

235
00:12:14.351 --> 00:12:15.730
<v Speaker 1>Will he make it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

236
00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:16.623
<v Speaker 1>that's not going to feel great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's not telling me that he's not </v>

237
00:12:19.571 --> 00:12:20.404
<v Speaker 1>going to make it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's really my main criticism of </v>

238
00:12:22.871 --> 00:12:23.704
<v Speaker 1>the movie is that the characters are </v>
<v Speaker 1>subsumed by the plot elements of making </v>

239
00:12:28.031 --> 00:12:29.320
<v Speaker 1>a time travel story work.</v>

240
00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:32.200
<v Speaker 1>All that said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

241
00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.150
<v Speaker 1>really enjoyable movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

242
00:12:34.151 --> 00:12:37.330
<v Speaker 1>one thing that was fantastic sound </v>
<v Speaker 1>editing sound mixing.</v>

243
00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:39.130
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing.</v>

244
00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:40.293
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who did it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you did a great job and you should </v>

245
00:12:41.741 --> 00:12:42.574
<v Speaker 1>be nominated for an Oscar because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought that the way that the story </v>

246
00:12:45.011 --> 00:12:45.844
<v Speaker 1>moved along with sound was brilliant and</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite the problems I had with the end </v>

247
00:12:50.531 --> 00:12:51.364
<v Speaker 1>of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just that that really just precludes </v>

248
00:12:53.981 --> 00:12:55.720
<v Speaker 1>it from becoming a great movie from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

249
00:12:55.721 --> 00:12:58.390
<v Speaker 1>really good movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think that if you haven't seen it,</v>

250
00:12:58.391 --> 00:13:00.640
<v Speaker 1>which would be ridiculous at this point </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I've spoiled all of it,</v>

251
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.950
<v Speaker 1>but if you haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go see it,</v>

252
00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:04.270
<v Speaker 1>it's worth the money to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See.</v>

253
00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:07.780
<v Speaker 1>That's the review I have of looper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope you enjoyed it.</v>

254
00:13:07.781 --> 00:13:10.720
<v Speaker 1>Hope it wasn't too long and if you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you leave,</v>

255
00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:12.700
<v Speaker 1>please leave any comments what you think</v>
<v Speaker 1>about this.</v>

256
00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:13.743
<v Speaker 1>If you want me to do more of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot of fun and I will see you </v>

257
00:13:16.361 --> 00:13:17.194
<v Speaker 1>next time.</v>
