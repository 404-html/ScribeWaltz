00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:02.423
<v Speaker 1>When it comes to retail shopping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>statistically there is no day more </v>

2
00:00:06.241 --> 00:00:10.080
<v Speaker 1>harmful to your physical wellbeing than </v>
<v Speaker 1>black Friday.</v>

3
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:10.943
<v Speaker 1>It's a day that can even be fatal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In 2008 customers broke down the doors </v>

4
00:00:14.971 --> 00:00:15.804
<v Speaker 1>at a Walmart in valley stream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New York and an employee was killed in </v>

5
00:00:19.711 --> 00:00:21.480
<v Speaker 1>the ensuing stampede.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since then,</v>

6
00:00:21.481 --> 00:00:25.950
<v Speaker 1>the occupational safety and Health </v>
<v Speaker 1>Administration or Osha has issued safety</v>

7
00:00:25.951 --> 00:00:30.660
<v Speaker 1>guidelines for stores wanting to avoid a</v>
<v Speaker 1>similar incident and why do people go so</v>

8
00:00:30.661 --> 00:00:33.960
<v Speaker 1>crazy on black Friday?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the deals of course,</v>

9
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.823
<v Speaker 1>the deals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the opportunity to get a 32 inch plasma </v>

10
00:00:36.631 --> 00:00:37.464
<v Speaker 1>TV for $179.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The chance to finish all your Christmas </v>

11
00:00:40.321 --> 00:00:41.154
<v Speaker 1>shopping in one go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The super big huge black promises of </v>

12
00:00:48.061 --> 00:00:52.380
<v Speaker 1>such Gargantuan savings have </v>
<v Speaker 1>traditionally made black Friday the most</v>

13
00:00:52.381 --> 00:00:53.214
<v Speaker 1>profitable shopping day of the year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indeed a number of businesses that </v>

14
00:00:56.281 --> 00:00:59.400
<v Speaker 1>operate at a financial loss between </v>
<v Speaker 1>January and November,</v>

15
00:00:59.401 --> 00:01:00.234
<v Speaker 1>one smart read in ledger books report </v>
<v Speaker 1>sales during the holiday season that </v>

16
00:01:03.841 --> 00:01:06.210
<v Speaker 1>make the entire year profitable.</v>

17
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.790
<v Speaker 1>Profits by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are written in black ink,</v>

18
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.040
<v Speaker 1>hence black Friday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm about but but,</v>

19
00:01:11.041 --> 00:01:11.874
<v Speaker 1>but the only problem is both the name </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the savings of black Friday aren't </v>

20
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.960
<v Speaker 1>exactly what they see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me explain.</v>

21
00:01:18.961 --> 00:01:19.794
<v Speaker 1>The first instances of the term black </v>
<v Speaker 1>Friday actually have nothing to do with </v>

22
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:23.813
<v Speaker 1>accounting jargon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with a newsletter from the </v>

23
00:01:25.291 --> 00:01:27.720
<v Speaker 1>Philadelphia police department in the 19</v>
<v Speaker 1>sixties.</v>

24
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.370
<v Speaker 1>Lamenting the huge crowds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>traffic jams in general chaos on the day</v>

25
00:01:32.371 --> 00:01:33.204
<v Speaker 1>after thanksgiving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was not a term of endearment for </v>

26
00:01:35.581 --> 00:01:36.414
<v Speaker 1>Philly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cops knocked by a long shot despite </v>

27
00:01:37.891 --> 00:01:39.960
<v Speaker 1>efforts to change the name to big </v>
<v Speaker 1>Friday,</v>

28
00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.973
<v Speaker 1>the term stuck so it was left to </v>
<v Speaker 1>marketing executives to put a positive </v>

29
00:01:44.491 --> 00:01:45.324
<v Speaker 1>spin on the whole thing and that's how </v>
<v Speaker 1>you get the black ink thier and indeed </v>

30
00:01:48.901 --> 00:01:49.734
<v Speaker 1>like the name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the promise savings of black Friday are </v>

31
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.240
<v Speaker 1>largely an illusion as well and </v>
<v Speaker 1>illusion,</v>

32
00:01:54.241 --> 00:01:55.074
<v Speaker 1>carefully designed for you the customer </v>
<v Speaker 1>to act as irrationally and stupidly as </v>

33
00:02:00.331 --> 00:02:00.870
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>

34
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.510
<v Speaker 1>Big Box stores like Walmart and target </v>
<v Speaker 1>and best buy.</v>

35
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.120
<v Speaker 1>Don't put everything out for sale on </v>
<v Speaker 1>black Friday.</v>

36
00:02:06.121 --> 00:02:06.954
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they put out select items as lost </v>

37
00:02:09.301 --> 00:02:10.134
<v Speaker 1>leaders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Product sold at or close to a loss for </v>

38
00:02:11.731 --> 00:02:15.360
<v Speaker 1>the company to get you in the door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And amongst everything else,</v>

39
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.750
<v Speaker 1>they're still selling at a high margin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got the TV,</v>

40
00:02:18.751 --> 00:02:20.790
<v Speaker 1>but now you need the normally priced </v>
<v Speaker 1>wall mount,</v>

41
00:02:20.791 --> 00:02:24.240
<v Speaker 1>the normally priced Hcmi cables and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>normally priced Roku.</v>

42
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.470
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you look again,</v>

43
00:02:25.471 --> 00:02:29.580
<v Speaker 1>you see that the Roku though normally </v>
<v Speaker 1>priced comes with a $40 rebate,</v>

44
00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.920
<v Speaker 1>which you can get back in two months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Bad,</v>

45
00:02:31.921 --> 00:02:32.754
<v Speaker 1>except for about 60 percent of rebates </v>
<v Speaker 1>never get fulfilled because people just </v>

46
00:02:37.051 --> 00:02:37.884
<v Speaker 1>forget or they fail to comply with all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the print requirements they didn't read </v>

47
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.860
<v Speaker 1>when rushing around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>best buy in a friends.</v>

48
00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.200
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>retailers know exactly what it's like to</v>

49
00:02:46.201 --> 00:02:49.830
<v Speaker 1>be in a hectic shopping environment and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they exploited it to the extreme.</v>

50
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.070
<v Speaker 1>They know that rebates feel good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people forget.</v>

51
00:02:53.071 --> 00:02:56.190
<v Speaker 1>They know that warranty is may seem like</v>
<v Speaker 1>peace of mind and the checkout lane,</v>

52
00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.420
<v Speaker 1>but actually fuel a 15 billion industry </v>
<v Speaker 1>of pure profit,</v>

53
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.240
<v Speaker 1>pure profit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It feels so good.</v>

54
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:05.103
<v Speaker 1>They know that we shopped by means of </v>
<v Speaker 1>rationalization and justification that </v>

55
00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:08.854
<v Speaker 1>by putting a super expensive item next </v>
<v Speaker 1>to a normally price one will increase </v>

56
00:03:12.251 --> 00:03:15.130
<v Speaker 1>the sales of the latter because we don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>see price,</v>

57
00:03:15.131 --> 00:03:15.964
<v Speaker 1>we see price different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know everything that this article </v>

58
00:03:18.341 --> 00:03:19.174
<v Speaker 1>by economic researchers proved with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>help of Mri scans that we are not </v>

59
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:23.463
<v Speaker 1>rational actors when we shop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that the image of a deal lights up </v>

60
00:03:26.501 --> 00:03:27.334
<v Speaker 1>our brain with pleasure like a Christmas</v>
<v Speaker 1>tree and that we choose between that </v>

61
00:03:31.091 --> 00:03:34.600
<v Speaker 1>pleasure and the pain of spending when </v>
<v Speaker 1>deciding on a purchase.</v>

62
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.040
<v Speaker 1>Retailers do everything they can to </v>
<v Speaker 1>remove the immediate pain of spending,</v>

63
00:03:39.041 --> 00:03:41.050
<v Speaker 1>hence rebates in store,</v>
<v Speaker 1>credit cards,</v>

64
00:03:41.051 --> 00:03:44.650
<v Speaker 1>installment plans and the like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's these things often riddled with</v>

65
00:03:44.651 --> 00:03:45.484
<v Speaker 1>hidden fees and Hula hoops that ended up</v>
<v Speaker 1>killing and eclipsing the savings you </v>

66
00:03:49.211 --> 00:03:50.860
<v Speaker 1>thought you were getting in the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

67
00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.840
<v Speaker 1>As Derek Thompson writes in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Atlantic,</v>

68
00:03:52.841 --> 00:03:53.674
<v Speaker 1>the first and last rule of prices is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that nobody knows what anything is </v>

69
00:03:57.071 --> 00:04:00.130
<v Speaker 1>really worth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shoppers are guided by shallow clues.</v>

70
00:04:00.131 --> 00:04:01.930
<v Speaker 1>This is cheaper than that and latent </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions.</v>

71
00:04:01.931 --> 00:04:05.770
<v Speaker 1>It just feels like a good deal rather </v>
<v Speaker 1>than knowledge and deliberate thinking,</v>

72
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:06.633
<v Speaker 1>but this isn't just the case for black </v>
<v Speaker 1>Friday and increasingly anachronistic </v>

73
00:04:09.431 --> 00:04:10.264
<v Speaker 1>term.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a world of Cyber Mondays and </v>

74
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.440
<v Speaker 1>Thursdays where Santa is an employee of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ford and Chevy and Mercedes-benz.</v>

75
00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:17.643
<v Speaker 1>It's true the whole year round,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps in this case the black ink </v>

76
00:04:20.201 --> 00:04:21.034
<v Speaker 1>theory is worth keeping in mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the retailers that go into the </v>

77
00:04:24.101 --> 00:04:24.934
<v Speaker 1>black on black Friday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the customers think of it that way </v>

78
00:04:28.151 --> 00:04:33.151
<v Speaker 1>and it's easier to see that despite </v>
<v Speaker 1>every single ad saying otherwise the day</v>

79
00:04:33.701 --> 00:04:37.090
<v Speaker 1>was never really about you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about them</v>

80
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:39.333
<v Speaker 2>black.</v>

81
00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:44.663
<v Speaker 1>Hey everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for watching and happy </v>

82
00:04:45.781 --> 00:04:48.090
<v Speaker 1>thanksgiving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is so much more to say about black</v>

83
00:04:48.091 --> 00:04:48.924
<v Speaker 1>Friday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly how it relates to economic </v>

84
00:04:50.521 --> 00:04:52.380
<v Speaker 1>inequality in our country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't get into that,</v>

85
00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.393
<v Speaker 1>but if you want to read more about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can find that in the description </v>

<v Speaker 1>video about sexism or amazing,</v>

89

<v Speaker 1>incredibly thought out and I'm so glad I</v>
<v Speaker 1>got to have the conversation with you </v>
