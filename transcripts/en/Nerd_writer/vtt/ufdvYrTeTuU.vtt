1
00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.280
<v Speaker 1>I try to make it seem like I'm just </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting this out,</v>

2
00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:05.680
<v Speaker 1>but I know all the moves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know every little piece of it</v>

3
00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:12.760
<v Speaker 2>just here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just go here.</v>

4
00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.390
<v Speaker 1>This is what a Louis Ck joke looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a short one,</v>

5
00:00:20.391 --> 00:00:24.410
<v Speaker 1>only 207 words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are 207 words that are chosen,</v>

6
00:00:24.411 --> 00:00:28.430
<v Speaker 1>very purposefully practiced until every </v>
<v Speaker 1>one counts for something.</v>

7
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:29.743
<v Speaker 1>Today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to go through this joke beat by </v>

8
00:00:30.831 --> 00:00:35.630
<v Speaker 1>beat and explore how Louis C K </v>
<v Speaker 1>Constructs and performs his comedy.</v>

9
00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:36.613
<v Speaker 1>My girls are six and nine now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're actually a really exciting age </v>

10
00:00:38.301 --> 00:00:40.400
<v Speaker 1>because they're learning to do some cool</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

11
00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.190
<v Speaker 1>I played monopoly with my kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really fun.</v>

12
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.233
<v Speaker 1>Every joke has to have a premise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an idea that the inevitable punchline </v>

13
00:00:47.781 --> 00:00:48.614
<v Speaker 1>will snap comedically into place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The premise should be really clear </v>

14
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.120
<v Speaker 1>whether it's implied as in some one </v>
<v Speaker 1>liners or stated outright.</v>

15
00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:57.223
<v Speaker 1>As Chris rock once said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of comedians have great jokes and </v>

16
00:01:00.501 --> 00:01:02.000
<v Speaker 1>they don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why isn't this working?</v>

17
00:01:02.001 --> 00:01:05.930
<v Speaker 1>It's not working because the audience </v>
<v Speaker 1>does not understand the premise.</v>

18
00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.823
<v Speaker 1>In this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the premise has two parts accomplished </v>

19
00:01:08.451 --> 00:01:11.870
<v Speaker 1>in two senses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First Louis is playing monopoly with his</v>

20
00:01:11.871 --> 00:01:13.850
<v Speaker 1>daughters and second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my nine year old.</v>

21
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.840
<v Speaker 1>She can totally do monopoly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This world actually totally gets how the</v>

22
00:01:17.841 --> 00:01:18.674
<v Speaker 1>game works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she's not as emotionally developed </v>

23
00:01:20.811 --> 00:01:21.644
<v Speaker 1>enough</v>

24
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.130
<v Speaker 3>to handle her inevitable loss in every </v>
<v Speaker 3>game of monopoly.</v>

25
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.133
<v Speaker 1>The second part of this premise is </v>
<v Speaker 1>beautifully structured because besides </v>

26
00:01:30.841 --> 00:01:31.674
<v Speaker 1>very lucidly delivering the premise that</v>
<v Speaker 1>this joke is going to be our six year </v>

27
00:01:34.891 --> 00:01:37.740
<v Speaker 1>old girl learns what it means to lose in</v>
<v Speaker 1>monopoly.</v>

28
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.933
<v Speaker 1>Louis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we actually get some laughs out of the </v>

29
00:01:40.181 --> 00:01:44.250
<v Speaker 1>sentence by the addition of a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>words and a strategic rhythm.</v>

30
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.353
<v Speaker 1>I mean the simplest way to end this </v>
<v Speaker 1>sentence is to say that she's not </v>

31
00:01:47.761 --> 00:01:50.850
<v Speaker 1>emotionally developed enough to handle </v>
<v Speaker 1>losing it monopoly,</v>

32
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.013
<v Speaker 1>but instead he said</v>

33
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.080
<v Speaker 3>to handle her inevitable loss in every </v>
<v Speaker 3>game with monopoly.</v>

34
00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:58.123
<v Speaker 1>In this way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Louis adds to little comedic surprises </v>

35
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:01.633
<v Speaker 1>in the premise and make sure to include </v>
<v Speaker 1>a pause so that each can be appreciated </v>

36
00:02:05.271 --> 00:02:06.200
<v Speaker 1>in their own.</v>

37
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.290
<v Speaker 3>How to handle her inevitable loss in </v>
<v Speaker 3>every game with monopoly,</v>

38
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.700
<v Speaker 1>because the monopoly last is dark.</v>

39
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:16.643
<v Speaker 2>It's heavy</v>

40
00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.513
<v Speaker 1>mediums like Louis CK,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are experienced enough to master not </v>

41
00:02:20.861 --> 00:02:24.970
<v Speaker 1>only their own delivery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but where the laughs will occur in their</v>

42
00:02:24.971 --> 00:02:25.804
<v Speaker 1>jokes and how to deal with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Telling a joke is like riding a wave of </v>

43
00:02:29.351 --> 00:02:31.360
<v Speaker 1>feeling and if you watch Louis Ck is </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy,</v>

44
00:02:31.361 --> 00:02:35.920
<v Speaker 1>you'll see that during laughs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What he does is emphasize his last line.</v>

45
00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.320
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't give the audience new </v>
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

46
00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:39.363
<v Speaker 1>He augments the information just given </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that he actually learned how </v>

47
00:02:42.311 --> 00:02:43.144
<v Speaker 1>to do brilliantly from Jerry Seinfeld.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm opening for Jerry in front of like </v>

48
00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.930
<v Speaker 1>12,</v>
<v Speaker 1>$100 or $20,</v>

49
00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:48.773
<v Speaker 1>2,500</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and people are applauding bits </v>

50
00:02:50.711 --> 00:02:53.140
<v Speaker 1>and I had never encountered that and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't know how to handle it.</v>

51
00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.100
<v Speaker 1>I asked Jerry what to do and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you stay in the bed,</v>

52
00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:58.683
<v Speaker 1>you stay in the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're reacting to if you're angry and </v>

53
00:03:01.961 --> 00:03:02.794
<v Speaker 1>that's why they're applauding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You stay in that energy because a </v>

54
00:03:05.291 --> 00:03:07.270
<v Speaker 1>monopoly laws is dark.</v>

55
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:09.230
<v Speaker 2>It's heavy</v>

56
00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:14.683
<v Speaker 1>candy.</v>

57
00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.000
<v Speaker 4>Maybe you didn't get to win.</v>

58
00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:23.423
<v Speaker 1>The choice of candyland here though </v>
<v Speaker 1>Louis acts as if it was pulled out of </v>

59
00:03:25.921 --> 00:03:28.950
<v Speaker 1>thin air is the perfect counterpoint to </v>
<v Speaker 1>monopoly.</v>

60
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.873
<v Speaker 1>It's visual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the game pop straight into your mind is </v>

61
00:03:31.441 --> 00:03:32.274
<v Speaker 1>an object of colorful innocence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The drama and the funny voice is also </v>

62
00:03:35.521 --> 00:03:37.770
<v Speaker 1>performed like it was spontaneously made</v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

63
00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.900
<v Speaker 1>but the words and the images he uses </v>
<v Speaker 1>like Fudgie thing and gummy twilio's are</v>

64
00:03:42.901 --> 00:03:45.960
<v Speaker 1>carefully chosen to enhance that visual </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

65
00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:47.123
<v Speaker 1>Louis is never not in control and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>important because since the premise has </v>

66
00:03:51.151 --> 00:03:55.110
<v Speaker 1>been so strongly set up in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>counterpoint drawn out so vividly,</v>

67
00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:56.213
<v Speaker 1>the laughs that Louis gets here or </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually lapsed in anticipation of a </v>

68
00:03:59.971 --> 00:04:00.804
<v Speaker 1>punchline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not yet said the audience is already </v>

69
00:04:03.361 --> 00:04:06.720
<v Speaker 1>imagining how dark the monopoly last is </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be.</v>

70
00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:07.763
<v Speaker 1>Just watch how he gradually increases </v>
<v Speaker 1>these anticipatory laughs like the </v>

71
00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:15.060
<v Speaker 1>audience is a fiddle to the final three </v>
<v Speaker 1>word punchline,</v>

72
00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.953
<v Speaker 1>but when she loses it monopoly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to look at her little face and I </v>

73
00:04:17.941 --> 00:04:18.691
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

74
00:04:18.691 --> 00:04:19.830
<v Speaker 1>so here's what's going to happen</v>

75
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:20.723
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

76
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:22.780
<v Speaker 1>all your property,</v>

77
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.410
<v Speaker 2>everything you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the railroads,</v>

78
00:04:26.411 --> 00:04:28.300
<v Speaker 2>your houses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all your money,</v>

79
00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.330
<v Speaker 2>that's mine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now gotta,</v>

80
00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.820
<v Speaker 2>give it all to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Give it to me.</v>

81
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.800
<v Speaker 1>One thing Louis doesn't get recognized </v>
<v Speaker 1>for enough,</v>

82
00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:42.100
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is his ability to dramatize in his jokes</v>

83
00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.620
<v Speaker 1>when he acts out this conversation with </v>
<v Speaker 1>his daughter.</v>

84
00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.770
<v Speaker 1>The light touchy gifts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially with that hand movement right</v>

85
00:04:47.771 --> 00:04:51.040
<v Speaker 1>on the punchline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really locks the audience into the space</v>

86
00:04:51.041 --> 00:04:51.874
<v Speaker 1>where he wants them to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The audience needs to see the situation </v>

87
00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.980
<v Speaker 1>from a six year old perspective for it </v>
<v Speaker 1>to work.</v>

88
00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.133
<v Speaker 1>Then if he succeeded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tags or the two additional </v>

89
00:05:00.131 --> 00:05:03.640
<v Speaker 1>punchlines that follow will be that much</v>
<v Speaker 1>more devastating.</v>

90
00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:05.790
<v Speaker 2>Hilarious and no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

91
00:05:05.791 --> 00:05:06.624
<v Speaker 2>you can't play anymore a see because </v>
<v Speaker 2>even though you're giving me all of </v>

92
00:05:09.481 --> 00:05:10.314
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it didn't even touch how much you owe </v>

93
00:05:11.461 --> 00:05:13.680
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't even touch it.</v>

94
00:05:13.681 --> 00:05:18.320
<v Speaker 2>Baby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Going down to heart is really bad.</v>

95
00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:20.023
<v Speaker 1>Putting the audience in the perspective </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a six year old is important for </v>

96
00:05:22.281 --> 00:05:24.650
<v Speaker 1>another reason because I think on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>deeper level,</v>

97
00:05:24.651 --> 00:05:25.484
<v Speaker 1>Louis is actually trying to make a </v>
<v Speaker 1>comment here on the actual ruthlessness </v>

98
00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:30.403
<v Speaker 1>of the economy we live in where property</v>
<v Speaker 1>really is taken away from people </v>

99
00:05:34.161 --> 00:05:38.000
<v Speaker 1>sometimes by monopolistic interests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with debt to spare.</v>

100
00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:38.983
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His daughter is not emotionally </v>

101
00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:44.900
<v Speaker 1>developed enough to comprehend and when </v>
<v Speaker 1>we see it through her eyes,</v>

102
00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.770
<v Speaker 1>the reality seems even darker than it </v>
<v Speaker 1>usually does,</v>

103
00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:52.760
<v Speaker 1>especially in the final tab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All you been working for all,</v>

104
00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:53.863
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to take it now and I'm going </v>

105
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:58.610
<v Speaker 2>use it to destroy</v>

106
00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:03.610
<v Speaker 1>your sister.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just mayhem on this board for her.</v>

107
00:06:06.451 --> 00:06:11.451
<v Speaker 1>Now you know more than anything else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm obsessed with articulation,</v>

108
00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:15.510
<v Speaker 1>with the magic of putting things just </v>
<v Speaker 1>the right way.</v>

109
00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:20.370
<v Speaker 1>There are 207 words in this joke and not</v>
<v Speaker 1>a single one is wasted.</v>

110
00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:21.263
<v Speaker 1>They're used either in meaning or in </v>
<v Speaker 1>rhythm to contribute to the overall </v>

111
00:06:24.601 --> 00:06:25.434
<v Speaker 1>effect and effect that lets us see the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world from a different angle and more </v>

112
00:06:28.681 --> 00:06:31.620
<v Speaker 1>importantly makes us laugh like great </v>
<v Speaker 1>poetry,</v>

113
00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:32.513
<v Speaker 1>great standup comedy is language </v>
<v Speaker 1>distilled to its most potent form and </v>

114
00:06:37.171 --> 00:06:41.310
<v Speaker 1>these days few people distill it better </v>
<v Speaker 1>than Louis Ck.</v>

115
00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:49.960
<v Speaker 1>Hey everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thanks for watching and thank you to the</v>

116
00:06:49.961 --> 00:06:52.570
<v Speaker 1>great courses plus for sponsoring this </v>
<v Speaker 1>episode.</v>

117
00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:54.550
<v Speaker 1>If you love learning,</v>
