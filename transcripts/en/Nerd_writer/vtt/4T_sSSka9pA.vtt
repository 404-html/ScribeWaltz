1
00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:05.073
<v Speaker 1>It's impossible to imagine the long </v>
<v Speaker 1>awaited sequel to blade runner without </v>

2
00:00:08.351 --> 00:00:12.730
<v Speaker 1>some version of the iconic music that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Vangelis composed for the original.</v>

3
00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.230
<v Speaker 1>That's because the blade runner score is</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than a score.</v>

4
00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:19.630
<v Speaker 1>It's an indispensable element of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>

5
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:20.733
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could make that argument about </v>

6
00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.730
<v Speaker 1>almost all film music of movie minus </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's music.</v>

7
00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.680
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same movie and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's true too.</v>

8
00:00:26.681 --> 00:00:28.840
<v Speaker 1>If you were to swap one kind of music,</v>

9
00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.063
<v Speaker 2>nothing</v>

10
00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.093
<v Speaker 1>in the video I did on Howard shores,</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredible light motifs in the Lord of </v>

11
00:00:42.741 --> 00:00:43.574
<v Speaker 1>the rings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried to show how the score helped </v>

12
00:00:44.931 --> 00:00:47.840
<v Speaker 1>guide and elevate the emotional beats of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the story.</v>

13
00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.920
<v Speaker 1>It's great work from a great composer </v>
<v Speaker 1>and hugely influential on the trilogy.</v>

14
00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.920
<v Speaker 1>I think blade runner's music is </v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

15
00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.843
<v Speaker 1>It plays a different role.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The score isn't laid on top of the </v>

16
00:00:58.461 --> 00:01:01.130
<v Speaker 1>visuals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a guide or an addition.</v>

17
00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.480
<v Speaker 1>The music is sort of baked into the DNA </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the movie itself.</v>

18
00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.180
<v Speaker 1>All the audio that you hear including </v>
<v Speaker 1>score,</v>

19
00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.110
<v Speaker 1>sound,</v>
<v Speaker 1>design,</v>

20
00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.540
<v Speaker 1>dialog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's tightly integrated.</v>

21
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:12.403
<v Speaker 1>Each blurs into the others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Creation is really what separates blade </v>

22
00:01:21.751 --> 00:01:23.820
<v Speaker 1>runner from other science fiction films.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After all,</v>

23
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:24.713
<v Speaker 1>electronic music had been a staple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>science fiction cinema for three </v>

24
00:01:27.691 --> 00:01:28.524
<v Speaker 1>decades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By then going all the way back to </v>

25
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.200
<v Speaker 1>Bernard Herman's use of the therapy in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the day the earth stood still herman,</v>

26
00:01:34.201 --> 00:01:38.550
<v Speaker 1>another revolutionary composers like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lewis and Bebe Barron used winding,</v>

27
00:01:38.551 --> 00:01:39.870
<v Speaker 1>bending,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sputtering,</v>

28
00:01:39.871 --> 00:01:42.930
<v Speaker 1>electronic sounds to evoke aliens and </v>
<v Speaker 1>alien planets.</v>

29
00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:47.643
<v Speaker 1>Renner is somewhere in the middle </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the a melodic soundscapes of </v>

30
00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.273
<v Speaker 1>forbidden planet and the grand symphonic</v>
<v Speaker 1>themes of something like star wars and </v>

31
00:01:55.341 --> 00:01:58.270
<v Speaker 1>they gave us is pulling from that same </v>
<v Speaker 1>toolbox of electronic sounds,</v>

32
00:01:58.271 --> 00:02:02.500
<v Speaker 1>but these noises are put to use for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>more musical purpose in order to achieve</v>

33
00:02:02.501 --> 00:02:04.630
<v Speaker 1>that dream like quality that the film </v>
<v Speaker 1>has.</v>

34
00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:05.773
<v Speaker 1>The audience shouldn't be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>identify where the music ends and the </v>

35
00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.993
<v Speaker 1>World</v>

36
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:16.583
<v Speaker 1>Ms Dot lyrics that infused this scene or</v>
<v Speaker 1>a good example of what I'm talking </v>

37
00:02:18.841 --> 00:02:19.674
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They sound a little bit like wind </v>

38
00:02:20.581 --> 00:02:22.430
<v Speaker 1>chimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something that could very well be in the</v>

39
00:02:22.431 --> 00:02:25.170
<v Speaker 1>space and match pretty well with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dancing.</v>

40
00:02:25.171 --> 00:02:28.770
<v Speaker 1>The light on the walls and you have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sound is so layered with faint computery</v>

41
00:02:28.771 --> 00:02:31.410
<v Speaker 1>noises that it could also be a machine </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere in the room.</v>

42
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:32.783
<v Speaker 1>It also serves as a kind of atmosphere </v>
<v Speaker 1>at bed from which the clearly </v>

43
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.550
<v Speaker 1>nondiabetic not in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Strings rise as Rachel enter</v>

44
00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.340
<v Speaker 1>like even the dialogue has a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reverb giving it the same dreamy quality</v>

45
00:02:48.451 --> 00:02:52.560
<v Speaker 1>as the score and the sound effects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Becker,</v>

46
00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.963
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reverberation is absolutely everywhere </v>

47
00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.270
<v Speaker 1>in blade runner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could even say that.</v>

48
00:02:57.271 --> 00:03:01.390
<v Speaker 1>It's the manipulation of reverb that </v>
<v Speaker 1>gives blade runner it's distinct feeling</v>

49
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.240
<v Speaker 1>and the Vandellas is such a virtuoso at </v>
<v Speaker 1>wielding it.</v>

50
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:05.103
<v Speaker 1>The digital reverb that you hear in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie was something relatively new to </v>

51
00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:08.854
<v Speaker 1>music at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The world's first digital reverberation </v>

52
00:03:10.961 --> 00:03:12.210
<v Speaker 1>machine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the emt to 50,</v>

53
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.510
<v Speaker 1>was released only six years before blade</v>
<v Speaker 1>runner premiered in 1982.</v>

54
00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.000
<v Speaker 1>We all have a natural sense of river.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We hear it when we're in big spaces,</v>

55
00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:25.090
<v Speaker 1>how our voice reverberates and decays </v>
<v Speaker 1>across the room.</v>

56
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.080
<v Speaker 1>Digital reverb uses algorithms to extend</v>
<v Speaker 1>that decay even more.</v>

57
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:30.183
<v Speaker 1>The lexicon two to four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what Vangelis used for blade </v>

58
00:03:32.291 --> 00:03:34.960
<v Speaker 1>runner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could extend the up to 70 seconds,</v>

59
00:03:34.961 --> 00:03:38.470
<v Speaker 1>allowing you to make spacey a theorial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sounds like this.</v>

60
00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.610
<v Speaker 1>The emphasis on reverb accomplishes a </v>
<v Speaker 1>few things.</v>

61
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.580
<v Speaker 1>As I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Andrew Stiller noted heavy river because</v>

62
00:03:50.581 --> 00:03:53.730
<v Speaker 1>it implies a huge enclosed hard surface </v>
<v Speaker 1>space,</v>

63
00:03:53.731 --> 00:03:54.564
<v Speaker 1>creates a mood of mystery and paranoia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also it gives everything a feeling </v>

64
00:03:58.411 --> 00:04:00.930
<v Speaker 1>of distance as if the audio is coming </v>
<v Speaker 1>from far away,</v>

65
00:04:00.931 --> 00:04:02.880
<v Speaker 1>like in a dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>

66
00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.850
<v Speaker 1>reverberation blends things together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is one of the crucial ways main</v>

67
00:04:06.851 --> 00:04:07.684
<v Speaker 1>Gellis fold separate audio sources into </v>
<v Speaker 1>one oral master track because that is </v>

68
00:04:12.241 --> 00:04:13.074
<v Speaker 1>the goal here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every scene is composed to create this </v>

69
00:04:14.941 --> 00:04:18.690
<v Speaker 1>cohesive acoustic environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes the emphasis is on dialogue or</v>

70
00:04:18.691 --> 00:04:19.524
<v Speaker 1>sound effects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Other Times it's on the nostalgic music </v>

71
00:04:21.631 --> 00:04:22.464
<v Speaker 1>that calls back to classic film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except that Solo Saxophone was never </v>

72
00:04:28.371 --> 00:04:31.220
<v Speaker 1>actually used in classic film noir,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a whole nother video,</v>

73
00:04:31.221 --> 00:04:32.054
<v Speaker 1>but anyway,</v>

74
00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.620
<v Speaker 1>most of these scenes were interpreted by</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ben Jealous on the spot.</v>

75
00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.450
<v Speaker 1>The way he composed the music for blade </v>
<v Speaker 1>runner,</v>

76
00:04:39.451 --> 00:04:40.284
<v Speaker 1>it was by watching the freshly edited </v>
<v Speaker 1>scenes on a screen in his studio and </v>

77
00:04:43.471 --> 00:04:44.304
<v Speaker 1>playing whatever they evoked in him at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time it used primarily the Yamaha </v>

78
00:04:47.191 --> 00:04:48.024
<v Speaker 1>cs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>csad and analog synthesizer featured so </v>

79
00:04:49.951 --> 00:04:50.784
<v Speaker 1>prominently in blade runner that bank </v>
<v Speaker 1>ellis has his own section in the CSAD </v>

80
00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.100
<v Speaker 1>wikipedia page.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even today,</v>

81
00:04:56.101 --> 00:04:56.934
<v Speaker 1>the CSAD is prized among audio files.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like anybody who ever writes </v>

82
00:05:00.241 --> 00:05:01.074
<v Speaker 1>about it describes it as a living,</v>
<v Speaker 1>breathing thing that's partly down to </v>

83
00:05:04.111 --> 00:05:06.840
<v Speaker 1>the fact that the keys were pressure </v>
<v Speaker 1>sensitive,</v>

84
00:05:06.841 --> 00:05:11.250
<v Speaker 1>so the sound that it produced as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>marvelous acoustic quality in a way,</v>

85
00:05:11.251 --> 00:05:13.200
<v Speaker 1>it's the perfect instrument for blade </v>
<v Speaker 1>runner,</v>

86
00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:17.610
<v Speaker 1>a machine with the ability to match the </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional weight of the real thing</v>

87
00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:18.713
<v Speaker 3>in in one in one goal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can have from that to that to that </v>

88
00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:32.240
<v Speaker 3>which is which different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

89
00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.640
<v Speaker 1>as much as possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vangelis used his spontaneous first take</v>

90
00:05:47.641 --> 00:05:51.900
<v Speaker 1>compositions and the result is a deeply </v>
<v Speaker 1>personal reaction to the images.</v>

91
00:05:51.901 --> 00:05:52.734
<v Speaker 1>A second vision that fuses with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>director's own is the great composer Ed </v>

92
00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:57.623
<v Speaker 1>Guard before him attempted to bring to </v>
<v Speaker 1>life the complete sound profile of the </v>

93
00:06:01.161 --> 00:06:01.994
<v Speaker 1>city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interpreted through the genres of blade </v>

94
00:06:03.341 --> 00:06:04.174
<v Speaker 1>runner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody who's lived in a large </v>

95
00:06:05.361 --> 00:06:09.170
<v Speaker 1>metropolis knows that sound is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>constant feature there.</v>

96
00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:13.190
<v Speaker 1>At night you might hear a siren or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>scream somewhere in the distance.</v>

97
00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:15.980
<v Speaker 1>We may not have wheezing or sputtering </v>
<v Speaker 1>machines,</v>

98
00:06:15.981 --> 00:06:20.390
<v Speaker 1>but these days we sure have a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>beeping ones vein Bella strings,</v>

99
00:06:20.391 --> 00:06:21.224
<v Speaker 1>all these disparate noises together with</v>
<v Speaker 1>musical themes that are stunning and </v>

100
00:06:24.531 --> 00:06:26.840
<v Speaker 1>appropriate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the music swirls,</v>

101
00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:27.693
<v Speaker 1>it says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's coming from within the </v>

102
00:06:28.401 --> 00:06:31.940
<v Speaker 1>characters themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like an internal cry or a release,</v>

103
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.220
<v Speaker 1>jelly evangelists isn't coming back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For Blade runner,</v>

104
00:06:45.221 --> 00:06:46.031
<v Speaker 1>20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>49,</v>

105
00:06:46.031 --> 00:06:46.864
<v Speaker 1>his job is going to Johan Johansson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a great composer who's worked with </v>

106
00:06:49.691 --> 00:06:52.030
<v Speaker 1>director Denise Villeneuve three times </v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

107
00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:53.523
<v Speaker 1>I don't envy him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean everybody is going to be waiting </v>

108
00:06:54.551 --> 00:06:57.310
<v Speaker 1>for him to play someone else's iconic </v>
<v Speaker 1>music.</v>

109
00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:58.893
<v Speaker 1>If I were him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd resist the urge to Mimic Vangelis </v>

110
00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:01.713
<v Speaker 1>completely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As much as I'd like to hear every </v>

111
00:07:03.041 --> 00:07:04.150
<v Speaker 1>classic note.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

112
00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:08.410
<v Speaker 1>the sql deserves music as personal and </v>
<v Speaker 1>human as its original.</v>

113
00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:09.573
<v Speaker 1>I'm excited to hear Johan Johansson is </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpretation of a world that so many </v>

114
00:07:13.601 --> 00:07:15.920
<v Speaker 1>of us are so eager to return to</v>

115
00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:22.710
<v Speaker 1>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you so much for watching.</v>

116
