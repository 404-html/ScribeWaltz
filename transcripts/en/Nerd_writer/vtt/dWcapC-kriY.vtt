00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.950
<v Speaker 1>Intellectually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand that all of us are going to</v>

2
00:00:05.951 --> 00:00:06.784
<v Speaker 1>die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that humanity will perish and fall back </v>

3
00:00:09.341 --> 00:00:10.174
<v Speaker 1>into perfect obscurity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe not tomorrow or for a million </v>

4
00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:14.373
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but eventually all we ever made will be </v>

5
00:00:17.081 --> 00:00:17.914
<v Speaker 1>dust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet I keep making things other than </v>

6
00:00:20.291 --> 00:00:21.124
<v Speaker 1>for the reason that existential dread </v>
<v Speaker 1>grips may only about once a week and </v>

7
00:00:24.281 --> 00:00:28.120
<v Speaker 1>that I have a concern for bettering my </v>
<v Speaker 1>world along more modest timescales.</v>

8
00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.830
<v Speaker 1>I make things because those things have </v>
<v Speaker 1>intrinsic value.</v>

9
00:00:32.831 --> 00:00:34.570
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not a simple concept,</v>

10
00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:35.463
<v Speaker 1>intrinsic value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet it's something we all have </v>

11
00:00:37.201 --> 00:00:41.470
<v Speaker 1>assigned to the things we love to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's why we love to do them because that</v>

12
00:00:41.471 --> 00:00:46.090
<v Speaker 1>activity is valuable for its own sake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Writing Fiction,</v>

13
00:00:46.091 --> 00:00:49.060
<v Speaker 1>that's something I do for its own sake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Making music.</v>

14
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.060
<v Speaker 1>This channel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nerdwriter is intrinsically valuable</v>

15
00:00:52.061 --> 00:00:52.894
<v Speaker 1>to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It combines my love of learning and </v>

16
00:00:54.461 --> 00:00:59.461
<v Speaker 1>expression with the skills I've gained </v>
<v Speaker 1>in video editing over years and years.</v>

17
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.333
<v Speaker 1>When I'm editing these blogs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a process that takes about four to six </v>

18
00:01:02.801 --> 00:01:03.634
<v Speaker 1>hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I often find myself in a sort of super </v>

19
00:01:05.921 --> 00:01:06.754
<v Speaker 1>focused state where it almost seems like</v>
<v Speaker 1>my awareness is merging with my actions </v>

20
00:01:10.991 --> 00:01:11.824
<v Speaker 1>on the computer and the next thing I </v>
<v Speaker 1>know I'm feeling lightheaded because </v>

21
00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.810
<v Speaker 1>hours have passed and I've completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>forgot to eat dinner and now it's 1:00</v>

22
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:19.643
<v Speaker 1>AM.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a psychological term for this </v>

23
00:01:20.681 --> 00:01:24.520
<v Speaker 1>feeling and it's called flow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a concept introduced by a Hungarian</v>

24
00:01:24.521 --> 00:01:27.850
<v Speaker 1>psychology professor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mihai cheeks sent me high when he became</v>

25
00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.570
<v Speaker 1>fascinated by how artists got lost in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their work.</v>

26
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.170
<v Speaker 1>When she accidentally I talked to </v>
<v Speaker 1>painters or athletes or scientists.</v>

27
00:01:35.171 --> 00:01:39.130
<v Speaker 1>They all described to him similar </v>
<v Speaker 1>feelings of heightened focus.</v>

28
00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.083
<v Speaker 1>One composer described it like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are in an ecstatic state to such a </v>

29
00:01:43.121 --> 00:01:45.910
<v Speaker 1>point that you feel as though you almost</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't exist.</v>

30
00:01:45.911 --> 00:01:46.744
<v Speaker 1>My hand seems devoid of myself and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>have nothing to do with what is </v>

31
00:01:50.291 --> 00:01:50.650
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>

32
00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:51.483
<v Speaker 1>I just sit there in a state of awe and </v>
<v Speaker 1>wonderment and the music just flows out </v>

33
00:01:56.771 --> 00:01:57.604
<v Speaker 1>of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was this continual reference to the </v>

34
00:01:58.751 --> 00:01:59.584
<v Speaker 1>image of being in a river or water </v>
<v Speaker 1>flowing that gave Mei the name for his </v>

35
00:02:04.451 --> 00:02:08.040
<v Speaker 1>phenomenon and it seems about as old as </v>
<v Speaker 1>humanity is.</v>

36
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.830
<v Speaker 1>The historical sources suggests that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Michelangelo may have been in a state of</v>

37
00:02:11.831 --> 00:02:12.664
<v Speaker 1>flow while painting the Sistine Chapel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's reported that he would paint for </v>

38
00:02:15.911 --> 00:02:20.911
<v Speaker 1>days at a time forsaking food or sleep </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Tao of Jeet Kune Doe.</v>

39
00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.240
<v Speaker 1>Bruce Lee instructs empty your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be formless,</v>

40
00:02:25.241 --> 00:02:26.980
<v Speaker 1>shapeless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like water.</v>

41
00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.873
<v Speaker 1>Everyone can experience this feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to do so requires a few </v>

42
00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:32.920
<v Speaker 1>preconditions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>

43
00:02:32.921 --> 00:02:37.330
<v Speaker 1>you have to be involved in an activity </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a clear set of goals and progress.</v>

44
00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:42.430
<v Speaker 1>The task at hand must have clear and </v>
<v Speaker 1>immediate feedback and most importantly,</v>

45
00:02:42.431 --> 00:02:43.264
<v Speaker 1>there has to be a good balance between </v>
<v Speaker 1>the perceived challenges of a task and </v>

46
00:02:47.381 --> 00:02:49.100
<v Speaker 1>one's perceived skill.</v>

47
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.963
<v Speaker 1>She sent me high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>developed a model for his idea and it </v>

48
00:02:52.481 --> 00:02:55.180
<v Speaker 1>looks like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the y axis is the challenge level,</v>

49
00:02:55.181 --> 00:02:58.150
<v Speaker 1>and on the x axis is the skill level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you can see,</v>

50
00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.540
<v Speaker 1>when the challenge really hard and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>skills are really low,</v>

51
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.710
<v Speaker 1>that's going to cause anxiety because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what you want to do,</v>

52
00:03:05.711 --> 00:03:06.544
<v Speaker 1>but you can't even get close to </v>
<v Speaker 1>achieving any kind of representative </v>

53
00:03:09.701 --> 00:03:13.990
<v Speaker 1>drawing fits that category for me only </v>
<v Speaker 1>when the challenge level is high and you</v>

54
00:03:13.991 --> 00:03:17.650
<v Speaker 1>have the skills to match kind of state </v>
<v Speaker 1>of flow be achieved.</v>

55
00:03:17.651 --> 00:03:21.160
<v Speaker 1>The composer I quoted above had been </v>
<v Speaker 1>working at is crap for decades.</v>

56
00:03:21.161 --> 00:03:25.330
<v Speaker 1>The process was second nature to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A pro athlete who gets in the zone,</v>

57
00:03:25.331 --> 00:03:29.350
<v Speaker 1>another synonym for flow practices for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the balance of his life.</v>

58
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:30.303
<v Speaker 1>I've been video editing for 10 years and</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of all those years of hard </v>

59
00:03:33.911 --> 00:03:36.700
<v Speaker 1>earned technique,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can see what I want to do,</v>

60
00:03:36.701 --> 00:03:40.840
<v Speaker 1>like a mechanic can see how the pieces </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a car should come together and like a</v>

61
00:03:40.841 --> 00:03:43.150
<v Speaker 1>mechanic or a composer or an athlete.</v>

62
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:44.223
<v Speaker 1>I'm forced to push myself into new </v>
<v Speaker 1>territory because the challenges </v>

63
00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.920
<v Speaker 1>eventually get easier and I fall back </v>
<v Speaker 1>into a state of control.</v>

64
00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:51.783
<v Speaker 1>When writing fiction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I waver somewhere between arousal and </v>

65
00:03:55.001 --> 00:03:57.310
<v Speaker 1>anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will be many more years.</v>

66
00:03:57.311 --> 00:03:58.144
<v Speaker 1>I suspect before my talent matches the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gargantuan task of writing and I can </v>

67
00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:03.123
<v Speaker 1>slip into that space where the muteness </v>
<v Speaker 1>nest of my thoughts resolves into the </v>

68
00:04:06.791 --> 00:04:07.624
<v Speaker 1>lovely shapes I admire in other writers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The key point here is that flow is </v>

69
00:04:11.201 --> 00:04:14.200
<v Speaker 1>possible in so many areas of experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Art,</v>

70
00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:15.880
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sports at work,</v>

71
00:04:15.881 --> 00:04:19.360
<v Speaker 1>in business or law or medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's vital.</v>

72
00:04:19.361 --> 00:04:24.100
<v Speaker 1>Prerequisite in all those cases is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>extended devotion to crap.</v>

73
00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.963
<v Speaker 1>We all have the ability to distinguish </v>
<v Speaker 1>between different qualities of pleasure </v>

74
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.200
<v Speaker 1>being in a flow state seems to me to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>made of pure stuff,</v>

75
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.020
<v Speaker 1>not just for what it achieves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for what it is.</v>

76
00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:36.003
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why human beings can </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience intrinsic value in the </v>

77
00:04:39.461 --> 00:04:44.461
<v Speaker 1>activities that they choose to love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm happy to go along for the ride.</v>

78
00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.310
<v Speaker 1>So since I've been back from my last </v>
<v Speaker 1>little break,</v>

79
00:04:48.311 --> 00:04:51.010
<v Speaker 1>we've talked about beach whales,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Comic Book Films,</v>

80
00:04:51.011 --> 00:04:52.660
<v Speaker 1>Keen Sugi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hero effect,</v>

81
00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.720
<v Speaker 1>how nuclear weapons screwed art forgers </v>
<v Speaker 1>video games,</v>

82
00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:56.583
<v Speaker 1>architecture of the right to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>forgotten and now flow and the </v>

83
00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:01.443
<v Speaker 1>conversations and discussions in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks following all those videos have </v>

84
00:05:04.841 --> 00:05:07.660
<v Speaker 1>been more interesting to me in most </v>
<v Speaker 1>cases.</v>

85
00:05:07.661 --> 00:05:08.494
<v Speaker 1>Then the videos themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to thank everybody who's been </v>

86
00:05:10.841 --> 00:05:11.674

<v Speaker 1>engaging in these videos and these </v>

87

<v Speaker 1>topics.</v>

90
00:05:23.951 --> 00:05:24.784
<v Speaker 1>you asked me anything on tumbler where </v>
<v Speaker 1>we can really sort of expand on these </v>

91
00:05:27.911 --> 00:05:31.030
<v Speaker 1>topics or comment below.</v>
