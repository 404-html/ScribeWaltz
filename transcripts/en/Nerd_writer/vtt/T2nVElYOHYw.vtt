1
00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:02.463
<v Speaker 1>We have,</v>

2
00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:07.573
<v Speaker 2>I think we can all agree that political </v>
<v Speaker 2>corruption is a bad thing and you don't </v>

3
00:00:11.881 --> 00:00:12.714
<v Speaker 2>get more black and white in this regard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the case of former Virginia Governor </v>

4
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:17.603
<v Speaker 2>Bob Mcdonnell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>former Republican governor of Virginia </v>

5
00:00:19.921 --> 00:00:20.754
<v Speaker 2>bobbing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Donald has an Alvin sentenced to two </v>

6
00:00:22.771 --> 00:00:25.410
<v Speaker 2>years in prison,</v>
<v Speaker 2>24 months.</v>

7
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.820
<v Speaker 2>That is how long Bob Mcdonald will spend</v>
<v Speaker 2>in jail for corruption charges.</v>

8
00:00:29.821 --> 00:00:34.821
<v Speaker 2>Last year at Mcdonald was convicted of </v>
<v Speaker 2>accepting gifts from a donor in exchange</v>

9
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.940
<v Speaker 2>for political favors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This kind of personal corruption,</v>

10
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:39.803
<v Speaker 2>quid pro quo stuff is what we're used to</v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing on television and in film put </v>

11
00:00:43.411 --> 00:00:45.540
<v Speaker 2>simply,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't want those in power.</v>

12
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.870
<v Speaker 2>Our elected leaders to take ethical </v>
<v Speaker 2>shortcuts and we shouldn't,</v>

13
00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:51.043
<v Speaker 2>but our defenses are fragile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If personal corruption is the only kind </v>

14
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.890
<v Speaker 2>we recognize and protect ourselves </v>
<v Speaker 2>against.</v>

15
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.353
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is exactly the case in the United </v>

16
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.010
<v Speaker 2>States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A little over five years ago,</v>

17
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.873
<v Speaker 2>the Supreme Court in the landmark </v>
<v Speaker 2>decision of citizens united versus fec </v>

18
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.333
<v Speaker 2>took up the argument against structural </v>
<v Speaker 2>corruption and what happens when the </v>

19
00:01:14.521 --> 00:01:15.354
<v Speaker 2>political system itself is dependent on </v>
<v Speaker 2>money from private interests and found </v>

20
00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.490
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Last week,</v>

21
00:01:20.491 --> 00:01:21.324
<v Speaker 2>the Supreme Court reversed a century of </v>
<v Speaker 2>law that I believe will open the </v>

22
00:01:24.571 --> 00:01:26.180
<v Speaker 2>floodgates for special one.</v>

23
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.040
<v Speaker 2>The majority decided that political </v>
<v Speaker 2>donations from how ever large and entity</v>

24
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.173
<v Speaker 2>or protected as a form of free speech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but does this misunderstand the way </v>

25
00:01:39.171 --> 00:01:40.004
<v Speaker 2>politics actually works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Though there is no explicit promise of </v>

26
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.833
<v Speaker 2>legislative favors for campaign donors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>politicians remain indebted to their </v>

27
00:01:48.591 --> 00:01:49.424
<v Speaker 2>wealthiest benefactors and this that </v>
<v Speaker 2>weaves its way into policy decisions </v>

28
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.550
<v Speaker 2>that considered the needs of private </v>
<v Speaker 2>interests over those of the common.</v>

29
00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.530
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the key argument against regulating this</v>

30
00:02:00.531 --> 00:02:05.180
<v Speaker 2>kind of structural corruption is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to determine where free speech</v>

31
00:02:05.181 --> 00:02:10.181
<v Speaker 2>ends and political corruption begins and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it may not be the court's placed to</v>

32
00:02:10.401 --> 00:02:13.430
<v Speaker 2>draw that line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The premise is freedom of speech,</v>

33
00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:14.703
<v Speaker 2>the more speech the bed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my only recognizing something for </v>

34
00:02:17.811 --> 00:02:18.644
<v Speaker 2>something personal corruption.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The courts actually do draw a line and </v>

35
00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.790
<v Speaker 2>abdicate themselves from the complex </v>
<v Speaker 2>interplay of money and politics,</v>

36
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.780
<v Speaker 2>and I guess most people who accused </v>
<v Speaker 2>American politics of being corrupt,</v>

37
00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.943
<v Speaker 2>do so because they see an essential </v>
<v Speaker 2>unfairness in the system reflected in </v>

38
00:02:35.031 --> 00:02:36.680
<v Speaker 2>vast economic inequality.</v>

39
00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.020
<v Speaker 2>That's getting worse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not better.</v>

40
00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:40.063
<v Speaker 2>As time goes on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the power of a political campaign </v>

41
00:02:41.871 --> 00:02:42.704
<v Speaker 2>comes down to the size of its coffers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's easy to see how moneyed interests </v>

42
00:02:46.371 --> 00:02:51.350
<v Speaker 2>retaining an improper advantage and when</v>
<v Speaker 2>that advantage serves to worsen existing</v>

43
00:02:51.351 --> 00:02:54.260
<v Speaker 2>inequalities in the system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>such politics are,</v>

44
00:02:54.261 --> 00:02:57.610
<v Speaker 2>at least in part structurally corrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>worst of all,</v>

45
00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:58.473
<v Speaker 2>structural corruption more than personal</v>
<v Speaker 2>corruption perpetuates the idea that </v>

46
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.290
<v Speaker 2>individual people don't have a voice in </v>
<v Speaker 2>politics.</v>

47
00:03:05.291 --> 00:03:06.124
<v Speaker 2>That putting the needs of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Commonwealth first is impossible and so </v>

48
00:03:09.881 --> 00:03:12.280
<v Speaker 2>it's pointless to try.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ironically,</v>

49
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.310
<v Speaker 2>this kind of collective action </v>
<v Speaker 2>diminished by the free speech of wealthy</v>

50
00:03:17.381 --> 00:03:18.214
<v Speaker 2>special interests is the only way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>protect democracy from the corrupting </v>

51
00:03:22.691 --> 00:03:26.800
<v Speaker 2>influences at it.</v>
