1
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.320
<v Speaker 1>Commonly reported symptoms of clinical </v>
<v Speaker 1>depression is a warped sense.</v>

2
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.020
<v Speaker 2>Everything can feel like it's moving in </v>
<v Speaker 2>super slow motion.</v>

3
00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:28.423
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>depression warps everything around it </v>

4
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.270
<v Speaker 2>like a star warped spacetime that only </v>
<v Speaker 2>your sense of duration,</v>

5
00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.760
<v Speaker 2>but also your sense of yourself and </v>
<v Speaker 2>others.</v>

6
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.300
<v Speaker 2>Your mental life is thrown out of all </v>
<v Speaker 2>proportion.</v>

7
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.190
<v Speaker 2>In his film,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Melancholia,</v>

8
00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.053
<v Speaker 2>Lars von Trier uses skewed proportions </v>
<v Speaker 2>to communicate a feeling that he's </v>

9
00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.710
<v Speaker 2>intimately familiar with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

10
00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:50.553
<v Speaker 2>when I ride,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can only write about myself and this </v>

11
00:00:54.291 --> 00:00:58.280
<v Speaker 2>is more or less a description of my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my own depression.</v>

12
00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:59.593
<v Speaker 2>The very first scene after the slow </v>
<v Speaker 2>motion montage that speaking of warp </v>

13
00:01:02.601 --> 00:01:03.434
<v Speaker 2>time shows both the end of the film and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the end of world is the newly married </v>

14
00:01:07.821 --> 00:01:08.654
<v Speaker 2>Justine and Michael trying to get from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ceremony to the reception in a </v>

15
00:01:12.891 --> 00:01:13.724
<v Speaker 2>stretch limo that is almost comically </v>
<v Speaker 2>too large for the country road that </v>

16
00:01:16.911 --> 00:01:17.744
<v Speaker 2>they're driving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eventually they have to abandon the car </v>

17
00:01:20.091 --> 00:01:20.924
<v Speaker 2>and walk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and by the time they get to the castle </v>

18
00:01:22.401 --> 00:01:23.234
<v Speaker 2>where the reception is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>half of the night has already been </v>

19
00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:25.683
<v Speaker 2>wasted.</v>

20
00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.880
<v Speaker 2>What's interesting is that the viewer </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't really feel that lightness.</v>

21
00:01:31.881 --> 00:01:32.714
<v Speaker 2>We're only at the beginning of the film </v>
<v Speaker 2>and this I think gives us a hint of the </v>

22
00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.200
<v Speaker 2>weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost dreamlike temporal quality of the</v>

23
00:01:39.201 --> 00:01:40.034
<v Speaker 2>wedding reception to come.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One thing that keeps getting stranger </v>

24
00:01:42.471 --> 00:01:47.120
<v Speaker 2>and stranger to me as I rewatched the </v>
<v Speaker 2>film is the relationship between Justine</v>

25
00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.013
<v Speaker 2>and Michael.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean at times it almost seems as if </v>

26
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:51.163
<v Speaker 2>they don't even know each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Michael seems to be completely unaware </v>

27
00:01:53.721 --> 00:01:54.554
<v Speaker 2>of the severity of Justine's depression </v>
<v Speaker 2>and there are a few shots where Michael </v>

28
00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.650
<v Speaker 2>just stares off blankly like a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>dead puppet.</v>

29
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:01.550
<v Speaker 2>Here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

30
00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.150
<v Speaker 2>things are skewed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Volunteer doesn't give us a sense of the</v>

31
00:02:05.151 --> 00:02:08.330
<v Speaker 2>couple's past,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm getting ahead of myself.</v>

32
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.410
<v Speaker 2>The first half of the film is made up of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wedding reception,</v>

33
00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.273
<v Speaker 2>alternating between the party and </v>
<v Speaker 2>justine's various exits as she falls </v>

34
00:02:17.301 --> 00:02:18.134
<v Speaker 2>deeper and deeper into an oncoming bout </v>
<v Speaker 2>of depression inventory or uses the </v>

35
00:02:21.861 --> 00:02:25.970
<v Speaker 2>reception itself to set up an </v>
<v Speaker 2>expectation of continuous time,</v>

36
00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.760
<v Speaker 2>but Justin's exits make this </v>
<v Speaker 2>problematic.</v>

37
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.790
<v Speaker 2>The two parts of the sequence don't seem</v>
<v Speaker 2>to fit together.</v>

38
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.060
<v Speaker 2>Justine rides off in a golf cart all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way across the ground.</v>

39
00:02:35.061 --> 00:02:38.750
<v Speaker 2>She languishes in a bath,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the party is always there,</v>

40
00:02:38.751 --> 00:02:39.584
<v Speaker 2>always still happening when she returns </v>
<v Speaker 2>to it in moods that are increasingly </v>

41
00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.640
<v Speaker 2>detached,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even within the party time jumps forward</v>

42
00:02:46.641 --> 00:02:48.890
<v Speaker 2>at the whim of volunteers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>disorienting editing,</v>

43
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.340
<v Speaker 2>the film critic Marta grow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's drew my attention to the fact that,</v>

44
00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:53.443
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the newlyweds first dance is actually a </v>

45
00:02:55.161 --> 00:02:59.770
<v Speaker 2>montage of justine dancing with a number</v>
<v Speaker 2>of people while the song underneath it,</v>

46
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:00.783
<v Speaker 2>La Bomba plays continuously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What all of this adds up to is an </v>

47
00:03:04.451 --> 00:03:05.284
<v Speaker 2>unsettling feeling of subjectivity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of feeling that you're in the head of </v>

48
00:03:08.891 --> 00:03:12.460
<v Speaker 2>justine and by extension,</v>
<v Speaker 2>volunteer who's attempts to get a handle</v>

49
00:03:12.461 --> 00:03:16.210
<v Speaker 2>on things to lock everything in place </v>
<v Speaker 2>are upset,</v>

50
00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:17.303
<v Speaker 2>and then finally dashed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one in the film seems capable of </v>

51
00:03:19.811 --> 00:03:20.644
<v Speaker 2>measuring things correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's the number of beans in a </v>

52
00:03:23.561 --> 00:03:25.660
<v Speaker 2>jar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2,000,006</v>

53
00:03:25.661 --> 00:03:26.494
<v Speaker 2>piece,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or the correct trajectory of a rope </v>

54
00:03:28.751 --> 00:03:29.584
<v Speaker 2>planet.</v>

55
00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.600
<v Speaker 2>Everything that's handled,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Burns,</v>

56
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:32.463
<v Speaker 2>creases or shatters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we ought to mention the several </v>

57
00:03:35.741 --> 00:03:38.200
<v Speaker 2>artistic references volunteer makes in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the film,</v>

58
00:03:38.201 --> 00:03:40.510
<v Speaker 2>many of which are in the very first </v>
<v Speaker 2>sequence.</v>

59
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.010
<v Speaker 2>The most obvious is this shot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which sites John Everett Malays Painting</v>

60
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.470
<v Speaker 2>Ofelia after the character in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Shakespeare's hamlet,</v>

61
00:03:47.471 --> 00:03:51.190
<v Speaker 2>who is perhaps the most famous </v>
<v Speaker 2>depressive in all of literature.</v>

62
00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.010
<v Speaker 2>Then we have an actual shot of Roy </v>
<v Speaker 2>goals,</v>

63
00:03:54.011 --> 00:03:54.844
<v Speaker 2>hunters in the snow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a painting of hunters coming back to </v>

64
00:03:56.801 --> 00:03:57.634
<v Speaker 2>their village empty handed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which calls to mine another science </v>

65
00:04:00.161 --> 00:04:02.740
<v Speaker 2>fiction film concerned with the depths </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the soul.</v>

66
00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:03.753
<v Speaker 2>Andre Tarkovsky is Solaris.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The volunteer is a massive fan of </v>

67
00:04:07.181 --> 00:04:10.180
<v Speaker 2>Tarkovsky and there are other </v>
<v Speaker 2>similarities here to sell.</v>

68
00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.170
<v Speaker 2>Ours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

69
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.070
<v Speaker 2>makes great use of box coral prelude in </v>
<v Speaker 2>f minor,</v>

70
00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.590
<v Speaker 2>repeating it throughout the film and as </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's written,</v>

71
00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:21.040
<v Speaker 2>Tarkovsky likes to use music as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>reframe.</v>

72
00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.240
<v Speaker 2>The refrain brings us back to our first </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience of entering the poetic world,</v>

73
00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:26.283
<v Speaker 2>making it immediate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and at the same time renewing it </v>

74
00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:29.493
<v Speaker 2>voluntary or uses the same technique in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Melancholia with wagner is a prelude to </v>

75
00:04:33.191 --> 00:04:34.024
<v Speaker 2>Tristan and his old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a romantic song that speaks to how the </v>

76
00:04:36.341 --> 00:04:40.160
<v Speaker 2>filmmaker mixes his meditation on </v>
<v Speaker 2>depression with beauty,</v>

77
00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.950
<v Speaker 2>like a glowing blue planet and desire.</v>

78
00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.280
<v Speaker 2>And there are plenty of other references</v>
<v Speaker 2>to like those to elaine.</v>

79
00:04:46.281 --> 00:04:49.820
<v Speaker 2>Rene's last year at Mary and bought </v>
<v Speaker 2>another film with a dream like narrative</v>

80
00:04:49.821 --> 00:04:50.654
<v Speaker 2>structure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and of course these early shots jump </v>

81
00:04:52.791 --> 00:04:53.624
<v Speaker 2>forward to reference,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not exactly replicate later moments </v>

82
00:04:56.991 --> 00:04:57.824
<v Speaker 2>in the film.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Melancholia is no doubt a polarizing </v>

83
00:05:00.981 --> 00:05:02.840
<v Speaker 2>film.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's beauty is undeniable,</v>

84
00:05:02.841 --> 00:05:07.340
<v Speaker 2>but I'm sure many will argue that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>lacks coherence or focus and need.</v>

85
00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.740
<v Speaker 2>I have my own problems with the second </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of the film,</v>

86
00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:10.633
<v Speaker 2>but this is one of the most striking </v>
<v Speaker 2>portrayals to me of a disease that </v>

87
00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:16.543
<v Speaker 2>affects so many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but which is still so little understood </v>

88
00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.073
<v Speaker 2>in my view.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Depression is what happens when your </v>

89
00:05:23.451 --> 00:05:24.284
<v Speaker 2>identity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sense of the relationship you have </v>

90
00:05:26.271 --> 00:05:30.500
<v Speaker 2>with the world around you becomes </v>
<v Speaker 2>untethered and focused.</v>

91
00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.800
<v Speaker 2>In this process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything starts to skew.</v>

92
00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:38.330
<v Speaker 2>Time slows to a standstill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your body wants so easy to move.</v>

93
00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.180
<v Speaker 2>It feels like it weighs a ton for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>

94
00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:45.110
<v Speaker 2>Memories start to become disorganized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The memories of a film,</v>

95
00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:49.280
<v Speaker 2>on the other hand are all those works of</v>
<v Speaker 2>art that informed and proceeded.</v>

96
00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:53.330
<v Speaker 2>Perhaps this is why Vaughan tree or </v>
<v Speaker 2>surrounds his characters with so many.</v>

97
00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:56.630
<v Speaker 2>By the time we get to the second half of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the film,</v>

98
00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:00.200
<v Speaker 2>extraordinary situation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the approach of the rogue planet,</v>

99
00:06:00.201 --> 00:06:01.700
<v Speaker 2>Melancholia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>warps,</v>

100
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:02.563
<v Speaker 2>even the characters dispositions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>justine emerging slowly from the depths </v>

101
00:06:06.741 --> 00:06:10.990
<v Speaker 2>of her illness reacts to the existential</v>
<v Speaker 2>situation with calm.</v>

102
00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.680
<v Speaker 2>Claire on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hurt seeing other half begins to panic.</v>

103
00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:25.810
<v Speaker 2>The film in the end takes on the disease</v>
<v Speaker 2>of its main character.</v>

104
00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:27.490
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for one,</v>

105
00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:29.560
<v Speaker 2>am happy to see a film.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Ernest,</v>

106
00:06:29.561 --> 00:06:30.394
<v Speaker 2>about sadness as it stands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>science and medicine have come up short </v>

107
00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.073
<v Speaker 2>in their apprehension of mental illness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So maybe we ought to look to art for </v>

108
00:06:39.881 --> 00:06:44.881
<v Speaker 2>insights and solidarity about what it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like living a life out of proportion.</v>

109
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:51.830
<v Speaker 2>Hey everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thanks for watching.</v>

110
00:06:51.831 --> 00:06:53.240
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this video is a little bit late.</v>

111
00:06:53.241 --> 00:06:56.960
<v Speaker 2>I had a horrible stomach flu yesterday </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was just destroying me.</v>

112
00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:57.933
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I feel much better now and I love </v>

113
00:06:59.601 --> 00:07:00.434
<v Speaker 2>this film.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

114
00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:01.273
<v Speaker 2>I have certain problems with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think there's so much of value </v>

115
00:07:03.891 --> 00:07:06.200
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I love the opportunity to talk about</v>
