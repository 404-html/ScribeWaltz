00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:01.850
<v Speaker 1>This is</v>

2
00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:02.683
<v Speaker 2>the motherboard for the Super Nintendo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a 16 bit video game console that came </v>

3
00:00:06.051 --> 00:00:06.884
<v Speaker 2>out in 1991 in America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and these are the sound chips that </v>

4
00:00:10.311 --> 00:00:11.144
<v Speaker 2>worked in tandem to create all the audio</v>
<v Speaker 2>sound effects and music that you heard </v>

5
00:00:14.571 --> 00:00:15.770
<v Speaker 2>in Super Nintendo Games.</v>

6
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:23.723
<v Speaker 2>The first chip,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the SMP or the SPC 700 was a processing </v>

7
00:00:26.841 --> 00:00:28.160
<v Speaker 2>court,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were a video game.</v>

8
00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:32.240
<v Speaker 2>Musician could essentially write the </v>
<v Speaker 2>program that would tell the other chip,</v>

9
00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:33.980
<v Speaker 2>the DSP,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what sounds to me,</v>

10
00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.750
<v Speaker 2>whereas the original nes sound chip had </v>
<v Speaker 2>just five channels and could really only</v>

11
00:00:38.751 --> 00:00:41.760
<v Speaker 2>do creative variations on the same basic</v>
<v Speaker 2>sound.</v>

12
00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.963
<v Speaker 2>The Super Nintendo had eight dedicated </v>
<v Speaker 2>channels and used a sampling system </v>

13
00:00:46.191 --> 00:00:50.300
<v Speaker 2>which meant that artists could load in </v>
<v Speaker 2>noises or sound effects from instruments</v>

14
00:00:50.301 --> 00:00:55.301
<v Speaker 2>of their choosing with room for eight </v>
<v Speaker 2>simultaneous instruments and the ability</v>

15
00:00:57.141 --> 00:01:00.530
<v Speaker 2>to sample different sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Super Nintendo was a big improvement</v>

16
00:01:00.531 --> 00:01:01.364
<v Speaker 2>over its predecessor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there was still one huge limitation </v>

17
00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.160
<v Speaker 2>between the two chips.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The system could only accommodate for 64</v>

18
00:01:07.161 --> 00:01:07.994
<v Speaker 2>kilobytes of audio ram.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To give you a sense of how small that </v>

19
00:01:10.611 --> 00:01:11.444
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an average three minute MP3 song that </v>

20
00:01:13.071 --> 00:01:16.610
<v Speaker 2>you might buy on itunes is around six </v>
<v Speaker 2>megabytes,</v>

21
00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.280
<v Speaker 2>which is 100 times the size of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>super.</v>

22
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.640
<v Speaker 2>Nintendo is full capacity and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>just for one song.</v>

23
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.533
<v Speaker 2>The 64 kilobytes had to hold all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>music and the sound effects for an </v>

24
00:01:26.931 --> 00:01:27.764
<v Speaker 2>entire game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why you often got music that </v>

25
00:01:33.531 --> 00:01:35.840
<v Speaker 2>sounded well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not that great.</v>

26
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.300
<v Speaker 2>When you think of sampling in popular </v>
<v Speaker 2>music,</v>

27
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.600
<v Speaker 2>you might think of someone taking a few </v>
<v Speaker 2>seconds of an old drum beat and using it</v>

28
00:01:42.601 --> 00:01:43.434
<v Speaker 2>in new song.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Call it a sample that's even a few </v>

29
00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:48.774
<v Speaker 2>seconds long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>carries a whole lot of information in </v>

30
00:01:51.331 --> 00:01:52.164
<v Speaker 2>order to stay within the allotted 64 k </v>
<v Speaker 2>super nintendo music samples had to be </v>

31
00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.580
<v Speaker 2>kind of walking all the way down to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>single cycle of a wave form.</v>

32
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.280
<v Speaker 2>In order to make good music with these </v>
<v Speaker 2>limitations,</v>

33
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:03.960
<v Speaker 2>you had to be creative.</v>

34
00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.100
<v Speaker 2>What you're hearing now is aquatic </v>
<v Speaker 2>ambience from 1994.</v>

35
00:02:15.101 --> 00:02:18.340
<v Speaker 2>His Donkey Kong country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a classic by one of video games.</v>

36
00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.950
<v Speaker 2>Best Composers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>David wise wise,</v>

37
00:02:20.951 --> 00:02:21.784
<v Speaker 2>was able to ring beautiful music from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the limitations of the nintendo sound </v>

38
00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.170
<v Speaker 2>chips.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

39
00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.063
<v Speaker 2>the evolving swimming background patents</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're hearing in the song sweeps </v>

40
00:02:30.371 --> 00:02:32.830
<v Speaker 2>like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just work possible on the Super Nintendo</v>

41
00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.310
<v Speaker 2>and sampling something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This long and complex would have quickly</v>

42
00:02:36.311 --> 00:02:37.144
<v Speaker 2>exceeded the capacity of the system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why has had to think outside of the </v>

43
00:02:41.111 --> 00:02:41.944
<v Speaker 2>box.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the most important features of </v>

44
00:02:44.451 --> 00:02:48.820
<v Speaker 2>the wave station is the ability to </v>
<v Speaker 2>string together a number of waves.</v>

45
00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.690
<v Speaker 2>Waves can be defined as single and </v>
<v Speaker 2>motorcycle loops.</v>

46
00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.660
<v Speaker 2>With more than 400 internal waves </v>
<v Speaker 2>available,</v>

47
00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.700
<v Speaker 2>you can select up to 255 different to </v>
<v Speaker 2>play in any order,</v>

48
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.940
<v Speaker 2>including trace of pitch duration and </v>
<v Speaker 2>cross fade time wise,</v>

49
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.500
<v Speaker 2>took inspiration from the cord wave </v>
<v Speaker 2>station,</v>

50
00:03:08.501 --> 00:03:09.334
<v Speaker 2>a synthesizer that came out in the early</v>
<v Speaker 2>nineties and use something called wave </v>

51
00:03:12.461 --> 00:03:13.294
<v Speaker 2>sequencing to take a number of tiny </v>
<v Speaker 2>samples and play them in quick </v>

52
00:03:16.001 --> 00:03:19.090
<v Speaker 2>succession so that they made unique </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolving sounds.</v>

53
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:20.223
<v Speaker 2>Of course the Super Nintendo couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>arrange and rearrange samples on its </v>

54
00:03:22.931 --> 00:03:25.540
<v Speaker 2>own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in order to achieve this effect wise,</v>

55
00:03:25.541 --> 00:03:30.250
<v Speaker 2>painstakingly recorded individual wave </v>
<v Speaker 2>forms at different frequencies and place</v>

56
00:03:30.251 --> 00:03:33.190
<v Speaker 2>them all in the coding program,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one by one.</v>

57
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:34.720
<v Speaker 2>This program,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

58
00:03:34.721 --> 00:03:39.580
<v Speaker 2>is called a music tracker where music is</v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially boiled down to numbers.</v>

59
00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:40.623
<v Speaker 2>Each tiny sound is placed on a vertical </v>
<v Speaker 2>timeline and the columns represent your </v>

60
00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.053
<v Speaker 2>note octave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sample choice volume in some simple </v>

61
00:03:48.941 --> 00:03:51.100
<v Speaker 2>effects like panning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>feed and echo.</v>

62
00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.380
<v Speaker 2>It took wise five full weeks to input </v>
<v Speaker 2>every sample for aquatic ambience.</v>

63
00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.950
<v Speaker 2>It's a tedious process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the results speak for themselves.</v>

64
00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:35.550
<v Speaker 3>The Super Nintendo was restrictive </v>
<v Speaker 3>system for composers.</v>

65
00:04:35.551 --> 00:04:36.384
<v Speaker 3>There's no doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but as with any limitation breeds </v>

66
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.810
<v Speaker 3>creativity because the sound system </v>
<v Speaker 3>consists of two chips,</v>

67
00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:44.733
<v Speaker 3>64 kilobytes of Ram and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>hexadecimal code doesn't mean it can't </v>

68
00:04:49.571 --> 00:04:51.110
<v Speaker 3>make beautiful music.</v>

69
00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.560
<v Speaker 2>Hey everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank you so much for watching.</v>
