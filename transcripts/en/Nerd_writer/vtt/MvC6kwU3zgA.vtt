1
00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.240
<v Speaker 1>Because government I wrong the people</v>

2
00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe in government.</v>

3
00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:07.910
<v Speaker 2>There are things that can't do of </v>
<v Speaker 2>course,</v>

4
00:00:07.911 --> 00:00:11.900
<v Speaker 2>but I think the government has had a </v>
<v Speaker 2>positive effect in the lives of millions</v>

5
00:00:11.901 --> 00:00:15.770
<v Speaker 2>of people and yet no matter where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>fall on the political spectrum,</v>

6
00:00:15.771 --> 00:00:18.950
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to argue with those who </v>
<v Speaker 2>criticize government for the way that it</v>

7
00:00:18.951 --> 00:00:22.370
<v Speaker 2>allocates and spends the money that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>takes out of our paychecks.</v>

8
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.620
<v Speaker 2>The US government is a vast bureaucracy </v>
<v Speaker 2>prone to waste and redundant spending,</v>

9
00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:28.723
<v Speaker 2>and this is because it doesn't do what </v>
<v Speaker 2>most of us would consider to be common </v>

10
00:00:30.741 --> 00:00:31.574
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make decisions based on </v>

11
00:00:34.251 --> 00:00:35.084
<v Speaker 2>evidence or setting priorities and </v>
<v Speaker 2>making sure tax dollars are spent </v>

12
00:00:37.701 --> 00:00:38.534
<v Speaker 2>wisely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>American can be compassionate and </v>

13
00:00:41.811 --> 00:00:42.644
<v Speaker 2>responsible at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me just give you an example of what </v>

14
00:00:44.781 --> 00:00:46.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In 2005,</v>

15
00:00:46.371 --> 00:00:47.204
<v Speaker 2>George W Bush signed the deficit </v>
<v Speaker 2>reduction act and that bill set up a </v>

16
00:00:50.211 --> 00:00:53.540
<v Speaker 2>council to figure out how many federal </v>
<v Speaker 2>programs we're spending money on,</v>

17
00:00:53.541 --> 00:00:55.610
<v Speaker 2>things that were actually working.</v>

18
00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:56.743
<v Speaker 2>The council found that for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the government was funding 105 stem </v>

19
00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.350
<v Speaker 2>education initiatives totaling </v>
<v Speaker 2>$3,000,000,000</v>

20
00:01:03.351 --> 00:01:04.184
<v Speaker 2>in 2006 of those 105,</v>
<v Speaker 2>only 10 pet evaluations that were </v>

21
00:01:08.541 --> 00:01:09.374
<v Speaker 2>scientifically worth a damn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and of those 10 just for were found to </v>

22
00:01:12.801 --> 00:01:17.720
<v Speaker 2>be effective for out of 105 for </v>
<v Speaker 2>$3,000,000,000.</v>

23
00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:18.643
<v Speaker 2>You can find ugly statistics like that </v>
<v Speaker 2>all throughout the government and the </v>

24
00:01:21.681 --> 00:01:22.514
<v Speaker 2>reason is because spending decisions in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Washington and in the states too by the </v>

25
00:01:25.191 --> 00:01:26.024
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are made on things like costs on public </v>

26
00:01:27.801 --> 00:01:28.634
<v Speaker 2>opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the pressure from lobbyists and on </v>

27
00:01:30.351 --> 00:01:33.860
<v Speaker 2>the particular political ideology of </v>
<v Speaker 2>parties and politicians.</v>

28
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.010
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything but evidence.</v>

29
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.933
<v Speaker 2>I mean you read essays on evidence based</v>
<v Speaker 2>policy and you invariably come across </v>

30
00:01:40.461 --> 00:01:41.294
<v Speaker 2>sentences like the rise and promotion of</v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence-based orientations within </v>

31
00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:44.983
<v Speaker 2>government agencies is consistent with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the public sector's increased interest </v>

32
00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:49.123
<v Speaker 2>in efficiency and effectiveness as if </v>
<v Speaker 2>before they were primarily concerned </v>

33
00:01:52.521 --> 00:01:55.100
<v Speaker 2>with inefficiency and ineffectiveness.</v>

34
00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:57.343
<v Speaker 2>Back to the video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything about life in our </v>

35
00:01:58.731 --> 00:02:01.730
<v Speaker 2>technocratic society is hyper efficient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

36
00:02:01.731 --> 00:02:02.564
<v Speaker 2>Google just came out with a function for</v>
<v Speaker 2>web searching within the messaging APP </v>

37
00:02:05.451 --> 00:02:07.210
<v Speaker 2>because switching apps is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

38
00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.053
<v Speaker 2>like really unproductive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the feeling is that we're </v>

39
00:02:11.331 --> 00:02:12.164
<v Speaker 2>getting more efficient by orders of </v>
<v Speaker 2>magnitude while government is just </v>

40
00:02:14.901 --> 00:02:17.450
<v Speaker 2>taking a lot of time switching between </v>
<v Speaker 2>apps.</v>

41
00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:18.703
<v Speaker 2>The result of that is frustration and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the result of frustration is one of the </v>

42
00:02:21.561 --> 00:02:26.510
<v Speaker 2>great sleazebags of our time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why can't we use science and evidence to</v>

43
00:02:26.511 --> 00:02:28.460
<v Speaker 2>improve government?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How would it even work?</v>

44
00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:29.623
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>applying evidence to social programs </v>

45
00:02:30.711 --> 00:02:31.544
<v Speaker 2>involves a few things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the most important is something </v>

46
00:02:33.321 --> 00:02:34.154
<v Speaker 2>called randomized control trials.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This means randomly selecting a large </v>

47
00:02:37.971 --> 00:02:40.850
<v Speaker 2>number of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>splitting them into two groups where one</v>

48
00:02:40.851 --> 00:02:41.684
<v Speaker 2>group gets the benefits of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>programming question while the other </v>

49
00:02:43.461 --> 00:02:44.294
<v Speaker 2>group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the control group doesn't and these </v>

50
00:02:45.561 --> 00:02:48.860
<v Speaker 2>groups aren't monitored over a long </v>
<v Speaker 2>period taken from medicine.</v>

51
00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:49.693
<v Speaker 2>Randomized control trials are the gold </v>
<v Speaker 2>standard for determining how effective </v>

52
00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.720
<v Speaker 2>something really is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A government can apply this to policy by</v>

53
00:02:56.721 --> 00:02:57.554
<v Speaker 2>offering money only to the programs do </v>
<v Speaker 2>this kind of research and by attaching </v>

54
00:03:01.751 --> 00:03:02.584
<v Speaker 2>the condition that scientifically </v>
<v Speaker 2>rigorous evaluations must be kept up </v>

55
00:03:06.131 --> 00:03:08.650
<v Speaker 2>over time or the money will disappear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

56
00:03:08.651 --> 00:03:10.330
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to go down this road,</v>

57
00:03:10.331 --> 00:03:13.660
<v Speaker 2>you have to be willing to hear results </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you might not like.</v>

58
00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.240
<v Speaker 2>One of the most rigorous studies ever in</v>
<v Speaker 2>this field,</v>

59
00:03:16.241 --> 00:03:17.074
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was the head start impact study plan </v>

60
00:03:19.421 --> 00:03:20.254
<v Speaker 2>during the Clinton years implemented </v>
<v Speaker 2>during the Bush years and reported just </v>

61
00:03:23.081 --> 00:03:26.490
<v Speaker 2>before Obama's reelection in 2012.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The study found that headstart,</v>

62
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.333
<v Speaker 2>the program that aimed to help children </v>
<v Speaker 2>in poverty had by the end of the third </v>

63
00:03:30.551 --> 00:03:31.384
<v Speaker 2>grade,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very few impacts in any of the four </v>

64
00:03:33.701 --> 00:03:35.140
<v Speaker 2>domains of cognitive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>social,</v>

65
00:03:35.141 --> 00:03:39.160
<v Speaker 2>emotional health and parenting practices</v>
<v Speaker 2>at a cost of $8,000,000,000</v>

66
00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:40.360
<v Speaker 2>a year to the taxpayer.</v>

67
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.670
<v Speaker 2>Those were pretty shocking findings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

68
00:03:42.671 --> 00:03:43.504
<v Speaker 2>the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does poor spending mean that funding </v>

69
00:03:45.461 --> 00:03:46.294
<v Speaker 2>should be cut for poverty programs so </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we should scale back on stem </v>

70
00:03:49.391 --> 00:03:51.340
<v Speaker 2>initiatives?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

71
00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:52.203
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we should increase spending on </v>

72
00:03:53.231 --> 00:03:54.064
<v Speaker 2>both,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the money should be given to stuff </v>

73
00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:57.183
<v Speaker 2>that works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that just makes sense and we </v>

74
00:03:58.901 --> 00:03:59.734
<v Speaker 2>asked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Today is not whether our government is </v>

75
00:04:00.731 --> 00:04:04.030
<v Speaker 2>too big or too small,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but whether it works where the answer is</v>

76
00:04:04.031 --> 00:04:04.864
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we intend to move forward where the </v>

77
00:04:07.091 --> 00:04:11.890
<v Speaker 2>answer is no programs will end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Major Kudos has to be given to the Obama</v>

78
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:12.723
<v Speaker 2>Administration for facing the headstart </v>
<v Speaker 2>results squarely and ordering a full </v>

79
00:04:15.401 --> 00:04:20.290
<v Speaker 2>review of one of the signature pieces of</v>
<v Speaker 2>liberal legislation in the 20th century.</v>

80
00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:21.183
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence based policy has been a </v>

81
00:04:22.451 --> 00:04:25.510
<v Speaker 2>cornerstone of the Obama agenda in some </v>
<v Speaker 2>key areas.</v>

82
00:04:25.511 --> 00:04:26.344
<v Speaker 2>There have been some major wins by using</v>
<v Speaker 2>a competitive model of funding that </v>

83
00:04:29.591 --> 00:04:31.870
<v Speaker 2>requires strong standards of evidence.</v>

84
00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:33.043
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence based policy doesn't work for </v>

85
00:04:33.761 --> 00:04:34.594
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that any administration managed to </v>

86
00:04:36.491 --> 00:04:37.324
<v Speaker 2>shoe horn science in among the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>legislative pressures is a major </v>

87
00:04:41.171 --> 00:04:42.760
<v Speaker 2>accomplishment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

88
00:04:42.761 --> 00:04:43.594
<v Speaker 2>you won't ever hear about </v>
<v Speaker 2>accomplishments like this on the news </v>

89
00:04:46.181 --> 00:04:50.530
<v Speaker 2>because this stuff is incredibly boring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's part of the problem.</v>

90
00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:54.880
<v Speaker 2>Under the sensationalism of the media </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the squabbling of political parties.</v>

91
00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:56.013
<v Speaker 2>There is a deep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boring ocean of governance where </v>

92
00:04:59.561 --> 00:05:00.394
<v Speaker 2>tedious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but crucial work is being done every </v>

93
00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.873
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's part of our responsibility </v>

94
00:05:05.231 --> 00:05:09.130
<v Speaker 2>to wade into that ocean every once in </v>
<v Speaker 2>awhile and tune out the noise.</v>

95
00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:11.140
<v Speaker 2>If you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows,</v>

96
00:05:11.141 --> 00:05:11.974
<v Speaker 2>maybe you'll find something in there </v>
<v Speaker 2>that'll make you believe in government </v>

97
00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.390
<v Speaker 2>to everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thanks for watching.</v>

98
00:05:19.391 --> 00:05:20.224
<v Speaker 2>I have to give a heartfelt thanks to </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody who supports this gentle on </v>

99
00:05:22.311 --> 00:05:23.144
<v Speaker 2>Patrion by pledging a dollar or $3 per </v>
<v Speaker 2>video because that allows me to put a </v>

100
00:05:26.201 --> 00:05:27.034
<v Speaker 2>lot of work into a video like this with </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas that I think are important and </v>

101
00:05:30.041 --> 00:05:32.470
<v Speaker 2>fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not very click bait,</v>

102
00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.550
<v Speaker 2>so thank you for that freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't take it lightly and I'll see you</v>

103
00:05:36.551 --> 00:05:38.020
<v Speaker 2>guys next Wednesday.</v>
