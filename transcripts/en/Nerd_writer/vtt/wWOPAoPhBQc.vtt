1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:00.983
<v Speaker 1>Blackbaud,</v>

2
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.050
<v Speaker 1>so as we all know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steve Jobs died this Wednesday.</v>

3
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.320
<v Speaker 1>He was many things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an entrepreneur,</v>

4
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.910
<v Speaker 1>a visionary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a computer genius,</v>

5
00:00:20.911 --> 00:00:23.160
<v Speaker 1>and employer of thousands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a nerd,</v>

6
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.480
<v Speaker 1>a father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a husband,</v>

7
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.100
<v Speaker 1>a man of flesh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sinew and bone.</v>

8
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.510
<v Speaker 1>Many of these things will reach into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>future and be his legacy,</v>

9
00:00:30.511 --> 00:00:31.344
<v Speaker 1>but I think the final mark that Steve </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jobs will make on posterity will be </v>

10
00:00:35.551 --> 00:00:38.500
<v Speaker 1>further reaching than we can get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me explain.</v>

11
00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:39.383
<v Speaker 1>So I have a number of friends who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>product designers for tech and </v>

12
00:00:41.791 --> 00:00:42.624
<v Speaker 1>otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they have all expressed to me a </v>

13
00:00:44.101 --> 00:00:46.170
<v Speaker 1>similar frustration with the nature of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their field.</v>

14
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.730
<v Speaker 1>Things automated to last anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My products become obsolete in a year or</v>

15
00:00:50.731 --> 00:00:54.870
<v Speaker 1>let Celeste and both are certainly true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things aren't made to last.</v>

16
00:00:54.871 --> 00:00:55.704
<v Speaker 1>So during the week I work as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>telemarketer and I talk to people every </v>

17
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.980
<v Speaker 1>day who's 2000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>

18
00:01:01.981 --> 00:01:06.690
<v Speaker 1>2006 model whatever is already having </v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanical problems.</v>

19
00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.440
<v Speaker 1>Now with certainly true that the auto </v>
<v Speaker 1>industry could design and build vehicles</v>

20
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.460
<v Speaker 1>to last considerably longer than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't because if they did,</v>

21
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.710
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't come back in six years to </v>
<v Speaker 1>buy a new one.</v>

22
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:17.573
<v Speaker 1>This is called planned obsolescence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The origin of the term is credited to </v>

23
00:01:20.251 --> 00:01:21.084
<v Speaker 1>Bernard London in his 1932 essay </v>
<v Speaker 1>entitled ending the Depression through </v>

24
00:01:23.611 --> 00:01:24.444
<v Speaker 1>planned obsolescence in which he says </v>
<v Speaker 1>furniture and clothing and commodities </v>

25
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.910
<v Speaker 1>should have a span of life justice </v>
<v Speaker 1>humans have,</v>

26
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:31.763
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he also proposed that there should be a </v>

27
00:01:32.401 --> 00:01:33.234
<v Speaker 1>special government agency deciding the </v>
<v Speaker 1>lifespans of products and anyone found </v>

28
00:01:35.431 --> 00:01:37.860
<v Speaker 1>using a product past its depth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They should be penalized,</v>

29
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.980
<v Speaker 1>but the more judicious ideas about </v>
<v Speaker 1>planned obsolescence stuck.</v>

30
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.620
<v Speaker 1>Now what should be said?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That obsolescence itself is an intrinsic</v>

31
00:01:43.621 --> 00:01:44.454
<v Speaker 1>feature in any free market.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Accompany simply can't make the most </v>

32
00:01:47.461 --> 00:01:48.294
<v Speaker 1>durable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>advanced product possible because it </v>

33
00:01:50.071 --> 00:01:52.230
<v Speaker 1>would violate costs efficiency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically,</v>

34
00:01:52.231 --> 00:01:55.320
<v Speaker 1>the best possible product would be so </v>
<v Speaker 1>expensive to make that the term profit,</v>

35
00:01:55.321 --> 00:01:58.020
<v Speaker 1>it's price would be too high for anyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>to want to buy a call.</v>

36
00:01:58.021 --> 00:01:58.854
<v Speaker 1>That intrinsic obsolescence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there's a third kind and it occurs </v>

37
00:02:01.951 --> 00:02:02.784
<v Speaker 1>when a new product or technology </v>
<v Speaker 1>supersedes the old telephone over the </v>

38
00:02:05.791 --> 00:02:06.624
<v Speaker 1>telegraph dvds over vhs and laser disc </v>
<v Speaker 1>mp3s over cds or cassettes over vinyl </v>

39
00:02:12.541 --> 00:02:13.374
<v Speaker 1>records.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is called technical obsolescence </v>

40
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.900
<v Speaker 1>and really the history of the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the history of everything.</v>

41
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.260
<v Speaker 1>You can look at it as a process of </v>
<v Speaker 1>technical obsolescence,</v>

42
00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:27.603
<v Speaker 1>so in the early stages of the university</v>
<v Speaker 1>just had basic element of those basic </v>

43
00:02:30.851 --> 00:02:31.684
<v Speaker 1>elements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carbon step forward as the most </v>

44
00:02:33.311 --> 00:02:37.420
<v Speaker 1>versatile because it can form bonds in </v>
<v Speaker 1>four directions over billions of years.</v>

45
00:02:37.421 --> 00:02:39.370
<v Speaker 1>Carbon based molecules became more </v>
<v Speaker 1>intricate,</v>

46
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.223
<v Speaker 1>more complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eventually these systems designed to </v>

47
00:02:41.801 --> 00:02:42.634
<v Speaker 1>precise digital mechanism to store </v>
<v Speaker 1>information on how to build a larger </v>

48
00:02:46.151 --> 00:02:48.370
<v Speaker 1>society of molecules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is DNA.</v>

49
00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.233
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of like a factory that holds </v>
<v Speaker 1>precise records on how to build complex </v>

50
00:02:52.151 --> 00:02:52.984
<v Speaker 1>systems of molecules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so dna supersedes basic matter using </v>

51
00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.240
<v Speaker 1>basic matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Millions of years later,</v>

52
00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:03.040
<v Speaker 1>DNA produces that can detect information</v>
<v Speaker 1>via their own sensory organs.</v>

53
00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.313
<v Speaker 1>These brainy organisms can redesign the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world in their own mind and put those </v>

54
00:03:10.501 --> 00:03:14.550
<v Speaker 1>ideas into actions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With this guy right here starts creating</v>

55
00:03:14.551 --> 00:03:18.390
<v Speaker 1>mechanisms of its own technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Technology advances slow at first,</v>

56
00:03:18.391 --> 00:03:20.250
<v Speaker 1>but then it gets more rapid and rabbit </v>
<v Speaker 1>and rabbit and rabbit,</v>

57
00:03:20.251 --> 00:03:21.600
<v Speaker 1>rabbit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's next?</v>

58
00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.180
<v Speaker 1>The integration of the biological width,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the technological</v>

59
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.393
<v Speaker 2>same make.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These were taken at the West Highland </v>

60
00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.180
<v Speaker 2>police station in 1984.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were there.</v>

61
00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.260
<v Speaker 2>Same model were taken today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to let me see my son.</v>

62
00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.620
<v Speaker 2>He's in great danger.</v>

63
00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:54.960
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not exactly like that,</v>

64
00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.530
<v Speaker 1>but slowly and gradually we will take on</v>
<v Speaker 1>biological components.</v>

65
00:03:58.531 --> 00:04:00.780
<v Speaker 1>My grandfather had a pacemaker in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>chest.</v>

66
00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:01.643
<v Speaker 1>My other grandfather had a hearing aid </v>
<v Speaker 1>medal of honor recipient sergeant first </v>

67
00:04:03.931 --> 00:04:04.764
<v Speaker 1>class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leroy petry has a bionic hand that </v>

68
00:04:06.541 --> 00:04:10.550
<v Speaker 1>responds to muscle movements in his arm </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's fucking awesome.</v>

69
00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:11.483
<v Speaker 1>The relationship between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>technological and the biological will </v>

70
00:04:13.741 --> 00:04:16.410
<v Speaker 1>mature in the years to come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will become more intimate.</v>

71
00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:17.303
<v Speaker 1>Eventually our intelligence will take </v>
<v Speaker 1>advantage of the speed and power of our </v>

72
00:04:20.011 --> 00:04:20.844
<v Speaker 1>technology and our technology will take </v>
<v Speaker 1>advantage of the amazing pattern </v>

73
00:04:23.671 --> 00:04:24.504
<v Speaker 1>recognition of our intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We as humans will become subject to the </v>

74
00:04:27.571 --> 00:04:31.170
<v Speaker 1>rules of technical obsolescence and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are those who liked my friends get</v>

75
00:04:31.171 --> 00:04:33.240
<v Speaker 1>frustrated at the staying power of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>products,</v>

76
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.310
<v Speaker 1>but with technology and technical </v>
<v Speaker 1>obsolescence,</v>

77
00:04:35.311 --> 00:04:37.920
<v Speaker 1>the whole theory of design has to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>altered.</v>

78
00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:40.710
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the goal can't be to design </v>
<v Speaker 1>something which will last,</v>

79
00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:41.573
<v Speaker 1>but rather to have a positive effect on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the evolution of a product who defined </v>

80
00:04:45.001 --> 00:04:47.100
<v Speaker 1>the terms by which we will continue to </v>
<v Speaker 1>think about it.</v>

81
00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:51.000
<v Speaker 1>Designers of both hardware and software </v>
<v Speaker 1>will have a huge effect on the future of</v>

82
00:04:51.001 --> 00:04:51.834
<v Speaker 1>our race.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will be out in front of us </v>

83
00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.160
<v Speaker 1>inventing and defining ways by which we </v>
<v Speaker 1>think about ourselves.</v>

84
00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:57.023
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there were only someone in our day </v>

85
00:04:58.681 --> 00:05:01.290
<v Speaker 1>who seamlessly combined hardware and </v>
<v Speaker 1>software,</v>

86
00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.720
<v Speaker 1>if there were only someone who </v>
<v Speaker 1>understood that the relationship between</v>

87
00:05:03.721 --> 00:05:04.554
<v Speaker 1>these two things could be organic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine the future that we could expect </v>

88
00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:13.310
<v Speaker 1>if there were only a man who set the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stage between the affair of intelligence</v>

89
00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:14.213
<v Speaker 1>and its eventual form in a way that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>complimentary and profound and always </v>

90
00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:23.693
<v Speaker 1>elegant.</v>

91
00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.170
<v Speaker 2>And I think you still have to think </v>
<v Speaker 2>differently to buy an apple computer.</v>

92
00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:28.923
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think the people that do buy them </v>

93
00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:34.580
<v Speaker 2>to think differently and they are the </v>
<v Speaker 2>creative spirits in this world.</v>

94
00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:37.970
<v Speaker 2>They are the people that are not just </v>
<v Speaker 2>out to get a job done.</v>

95
00:05:37.971 --> 00:05:38.804
<v Speaker 2>They're out to change the world and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're out to change the world using </v>

96
00:05:41.451 --> 00:05:46.100
<v Speaker 2>whatever great tools they can get and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>make tools for those kinds of people,</v>

97
00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:47.923
<v Speaker 2>so hopefully what you've seen here today</v>
<v Speaker 2>are some beginning steps that give you </v>

98
00:05:53.361 --> 00:05:54.194
<v Speaker 2>some confidence that we too are going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>think differently and serve the people </v>

99
00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.233
<v Speaker 2>that have been buying our products since</v>
<v Speaker 2>the beginning because a lot of times </v>

100
00:06:03.081 --> 00:06:03.914
<v Speaker 2>people think they're crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in that craziness we see genius and </v>

101
00:06:07.761 --> 00:06:09.280
<v Speaker 2>those are the people we're making tools </v>
<v Speaker 2>for us.</v>

102
00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:15.100
<v Speaker 2>Thank you very much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thanks.</v>
