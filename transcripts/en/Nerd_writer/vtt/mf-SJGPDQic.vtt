1
00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:03.600
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just got back from getting my hair cut.</v>

2
00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:05.490
<v Speaker 1>I thought I should probably tell you </v>
<v Speaker 1>this before we start the blog.</v>

3
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.030
<v Speaker 1>Just had two shots of rum with my Greek </v>
<v Speaker 1>barber.</v>

4
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:10.080
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.500
<v Speaker 1>took the shots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>took the shots before the haircut,</v>

6
00:00:13.501 --> 00:00:18.501
<v Speaker 1>so he had those scissors up by my ears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Coffee on a Tuesday and block 37,</v>

7
00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.470
<v Speaker 1>three d movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please just stop making them.</v>

8
00:00:38.541 --> 00:00:39.374
<v Speaker 1>So last week the new judge dredd movie </v>
<v Speaker 1>came out and I was excited because it </v>

9
00:00:42.501 --> 00:00:44.960
<v Speaker 1>looked like the old faithful fair of </v>
<v Speaker 1>gratuitous,</v>

10
00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:45.794
<v Speaker 1>slow motion violence and explosions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the 1995 one with stallone is bowel </v>

11
00:00:49.631 --> 00:00:50.464
<v Speaker 1>scene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was ready to fandango some ticks </v>

12
00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:55.423
<v Speaker 1>when my friend and general sad news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Susan Elias told me that it was only </v>

13
00:00:58.341 --> 00:00:59.174
<v Speaker 1>showing in three days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only three d surely there has to be a </v>

14
00:01:01.761 --> 00:01:03.230
<v Speaker 1>two d showing somewhere.</v>

15
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:05.843
<v Speaker 1>So I think it's probably a good time to </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about why I don't like the </v>

16
00:01:08.731 --> 00:01:12.240
<v Speaker 1>troubling new trend of three d movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw Avatar in three d,</v>

17
00:01:12.241 --> 00:01:14.790
<v Speaker 1>I saw coraline in three d,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I had to.</v>

18
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:15.673
<v Speaker 1>I had to cut it off there because for </v>
<v Speaker 1>both of those movies it was like after </v>

19
00:01:18.841 --> 00:01:23.841
<v Speaker 1>45 minutes of finger started pushing </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the center of my forehead.</v>

20
00:01:23.911 --> 00:01:26.280
<v Speaker 1>Maybe this happens to you too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if it does,</v>

21
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.510
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you there is a good reason </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it has to do with evolution.</v>

22
00:01:30.511 --> 00:01:32.400
<v Speaker 1>So when we look at something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>

23
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.370
<v Speaker 1>there are a few things that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening with our eyes first,</v>

24
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.233
<v Speaker 1>like a camera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your eyes are focusing at a certain </v>

25
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:39.900
<v Speaker 1>distance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can imagine.</v>

26
00:01:39.901 --> 00:01:43.530
<v Speaker 1>Focus is sort of like a flat plane </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's moving away from you,</v>

27
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.440
<v Speaker 1>depending on what you're looking at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Second and unlike a camera,</v>

28
00:01:46.441 --> 00:01:50.370
<v Speaker 1>your eyes are converging on a point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the object of your gaze.</v>

29
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.353
<v Speaker 1>This convergence is the third point in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>triangle in which the other two points </v>

30
00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.490
<v Speaker 1>are your eyes</v>

31
00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:58.773
<v Speaker 1>triangle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For the hundreds of thousands of years </v>

32
00:02:00.101 --> 00:02:00.934
<v Speaker 1>that humans have been pottering around </v>
<v Speaker 1>and for the many more millions of years </v>

33
00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:04.563
<v Speaker 1>in the history of eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The focus point and the convergence </v>

34
00:02:06.761 --> 00:02:07.594
<v Speaker 1>point have always been the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you're sitting in a theater </v>

35
00:02:09.581 --> 00:02:11.680
<v Speaker 1>watching a three d movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things are a bit different.</v>

36
00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.540
<v Speaker 1>The focus point always remains the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Always say 60 feet where the screen is,</v>

37
00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.000
<v Speaker 1>but the convergence point is always </v>
<v Speaker 1>changing.</v>

38
00:02:19.001 --> 00:02:20.560
<v Speaker 1>Depending on what the director wants you</v>
<v Speaker 1>to see,</v>

39
00:02:20.561 --> 00:02:23.980
<v Speaker 1>the image might be 30 feet away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might be 100 feet away.</v>

40
00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.590
<v Speaker 1>It's variable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we can do this,</v>

41
00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:31.240
<v Speaker 1>but it takes our brains a few more </v>
<v Speaker 1>milliseconds to adjust to the change.</v>

42
00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.260
<v Speaker 1>This is why editing in three d films is </v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit slower than normal.</v>

43
00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.123
<v Speaker 1>As Walter Emerge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the legendary film editor and sound </v>

44
00:02:37.811 --> 00:02:38.644
<v Speaker 1>designer says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the CPU of our perceptual brain has to </v>

45
00:02:40.601 --> 00:02:41.434
<v Speaker 1>work extra hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why after 20 minutes or so </v>

46
00:02:43.271 --> 00:02:44.104
<v Speaker 1>people get headaches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing something that's 600 </v>

47
00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.030
<v Speaker 1>million years of evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never prepared them for.</v>

48
00:02:49.031 --> 00:02:51.790
<v Speaker 1>So if you're getting headaches in three </v>
<v Speaker 1>d films,</v>

49
00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.290
<v Speaker 1>it's not your fault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's Charles Darwin's fault.</v>

50
00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:56.281
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no wait.</v>

51
00:02:56.281 --> 00:02:58.140
<v Speaker 1>For years I've been decrying three d </v>
<v Speaker 1>movies,</v>

52
00:02:58.141 --> 00:03:02.170
<v Speaker 1>not because of the serious and seemingly</v>
<v Speaker 1>insurmountable focus convergence issue,</v>

53
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.740
<v Speaker 1>but because I think that they perpetuate</v>
<v Speaker 1>a false equivalency.</v>

54
00:03:05.741 --> 00:03:10.180
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen physical or illusory </v>
<v Speaker 1>immersiveness is the ruler of what makes</v>

55
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:11.043
<v Speaker 1>an immersive movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of my favorite d movies are pretty </v>

56
00:03:13.871 --> 00:03:14.704
<v Speaker 1>three dimensional in their own right and</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing in those ever pops out of the </v>

57
00:03:17.951 --> 00:03:18.784
<v Speaker 1>screen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this applies to gratuitous action </v>

58
00:03:20.501 --> 00:03:21.580
<v Speaker 1>movies too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

59
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.460
<v Speaker 2>in order to catch him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he must become him.</v>

60
00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.010
<v Speaker 3>Huge scissors cutting by my ears.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like his 30th cut at the day.</v>

61
00:03:40.571 --> 00:03:45.280
<v Speaker 3>So yeah.</v>
