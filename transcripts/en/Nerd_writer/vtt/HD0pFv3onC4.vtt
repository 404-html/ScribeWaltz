00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.640
<v Speaker 1>Coffee on a Tuesday and Vlog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>43.</v>

2
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.970
<v Speaker 1>Minimalism is everywhere.</v>

3
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:24.923
<v Speaker 1>It's a style in which the simplest and </v>
<v Speaker 1>view as elements are used to create the </v>

4
00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:28.794
<v Speaker 1>maximum effect and you can find </v>
<v Speaker 1>minimalism and almost every art form or </v>

5
00:00:31.351 --> 00:00:33.810
<v Speaker 1>kind of media in the visual arts and </v>
<v Speaker 1>music and literature.</v>

6
00:00:33.811 --> 00:00:36.030
<v Speaker 1>You can find it in architecture and </v>
<v Speaker 1>expensive food,</v>

7
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.430
<v Speaker 1>but most importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think for the current age,</v>

8
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.790
<v Speaker 1>you see it as defining trends in </v>
<v Speaker 1>advertising and design.</v>

9
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:42.653
<v Speaker 1>The influence here is in good part </v>
<v Speaker 1>Japanese where Zen Buddhist concepts of </v>

10
00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:49.440
<v Speaker 1>simplicity inform living spaces and ways</v>
<v Speaker 1>of life and not only for its aesthetics,</v>

11
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.040
<v Speaker 1>but also as a moral imperative to </v>
<v Speaker 1>respect the quintessence of thing.</v>

12
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.210
<v Speaker 1>No filmmaker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

13
00:00:54.211 --> 00:00:57.000
<v Speaker 1>did a better job of capturing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then Yasuhiro,</v>

14
00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.560
<v Speaker 1>whose films you should watch immediately</v>
<v Speaker 1>after this video is over.</v>

15
00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:03.540
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>camera always placed low to the ground.</v>

16
00:01:03.541 --> 00:01:04.374
<v Speaker 1>Ozu films have a two dimensional quality</v>
<v Speaker 1>exhibiting what is essentially an </v>

17
00:01:07.321 --> 00:01:09.080
<v Speaker 1>organization of geometric shapes.</v>

18
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.990
<v Speaker 1>I never forget the film frame itself is </v>
<v Speaker 1>directing.</v>

19
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.890
<v Speaker 1>This for me is the key of minimalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a movement of organized geometry.</v>

20
00:01:16.891 --> 00:01:17.724
<v Speaker 1>The relationships of shapes inside what </v>
<v Speaker 1>is essentially just a bunch of </v>

21
00:01:20.431 --> 00:01:21.720
<v Speaker 1>rectangles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the TB screen,</v>

22
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.220
<v Speaker 1>the computer screen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the film frame,</v>

23
00:01:23.221 --> 00:01:24.630
<v Speaker 1>the Youtube player,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the billboard,</v>

24
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.370
<v Speaker 1>the street sign,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the page.</v>

25
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.020
<v Speaker 1>A more recent influence is the Dutch </v>
<v Speaker 1>dish style movement or neoplastic system</v>

26
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.893
<v Speaker 1>as Pete Mondrian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whose paintings you will most certainly </v>

27
00:01:32.581 --> 00:01:33.414
<v Speaker 1>recognize said it is possible that </v>
<v Speaker 1>through horizontal and vertical lines </v>

28
00:01:36.151 --> 00:01:36.984
<v Speaker 1>constructed with awareness but not with </v>
<v Speaker 1>calculation led by high intuition and </v>

29
00:01:39.991 --> 00:01:40.824
<v Speaker 1>brought to harmony and rhythm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that these basic forms of beauty </v>

30
00:01:43.471 --> 00:01:48.180
<v Speaker 1>supplemented if necessary by other </v>
<v Speaker 1>direct lines or curves can become a work</v>

31
00:01:48.181 --> 00:01:50.970
<v Speaker 1>of art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As strong as it is true and it's true,</v>

32
00:01:50.971 --> 00:01:55.350
<v Speaker 1>the geometrical organization is one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>intuition influenced perhaps by symmetry</v>

33
00:01:55.351 --> 00:01:57.690
<v Speaker 1>and weight in photography by the rule of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thirds,</v>

34
00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.240
<v Speaker 1>but finally achieved by a feeling.</v>

35
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.420
<v Speaker 1>This feels right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comfortable balance.</v>

36
00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.100
<v Speaker 1>Take my end screen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

37
00:02:05.101 --> 00:02:05.934
<v Speaker 1>I must've spent and hour making my newt </v>
<v Speaker 1>millimeter changes to the elements that </v>

38
00:02:09.881 --> 00:02:12.480
<v Speaker 1>you see here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which when paired down look like this,</v>

39
00:02:12.481 --> 00:02:13.314
<v Speaker 1>three rectangles in a circle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inside a larger rectangle trying to </v>

40
00:02:15.541 --> 00:02:19.320
<v Speaker 1>achieve a kind of harmony between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>distances and empty blue space.</v>

41
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:20.183
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it was an hour wasted or maybe we </v>
<v Speaker 1>are more attracted to pieces of design </v>

42
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.433
<v Speaker 1>that work in the minimal sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe in the full appraisal that you </v>

43
00:02:28.081 --> 00:02:29.880
<v Speaker 1>take of my work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the end screen design,</v>

44
00:02:29.881 --> 00:02:30.930
<v Speaker 1>the framing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the text,</v>

45
00:02:30.931 --> 00:02:35.010
<v Speaker 1>the pictures reinforce or intensify the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reaction you have to the content.</v>

46
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.820
<v Speaker 1>The rise of minimalism is symptomatic of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a chaotic culture,</v>

47
00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:39.683
<v Speaker 1>bombarded with information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The organizational impulse is amplified </v>

48
00:02:42.211 --> 00:02:43.044
<v Speaker 1>and we're drawn to messages or products </v>
<v Speaker 1>that help us to assemble disparate data </v>

49
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.510
<v Speaker 1>into a coherent whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So instead of this,</v>

50
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.740
<v Speaker 1>we want this and instead of these we use</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

51
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.860
<v Speaker 1>life is marked with contradictory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but balancing trends.</v>

52
00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.890
<v Speaker 1>Tendencies that aim in their way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>harmonize the of maternity minimalism is</v>

53
00:03:01.361 --> 00:03:02.194
<v Speaker 1>a reminder and a welcome one that in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fog of appointments and facebook </v>

54
00:03:04.961 --> 00:03:05.794
<v Speaker 1>notifications and different types of </v>
<v Speaker 1>shampoo and homework and real work that </v>

55
00:03:10.241 --> 00:03:11.074
<v Speaker 1>you can breathe</v>

56
00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.920
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
