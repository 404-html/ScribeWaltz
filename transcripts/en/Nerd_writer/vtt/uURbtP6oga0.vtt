<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

00:00:01.021 --> 00:00:02.010
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3
00:00:02.011 --> 00:00:03.090
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4
00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.120
<v Speaker 1>Coffee on a Tuesday and Vlog 38.</v>

5
00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:16.960
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

6
00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.560
<v Speaker 1>Laziness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Being unwilling to use work or energy.</v>

7
00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.620
<v Speaker 1>A lazy person sometimes called slacker </v>
<v Speaker 1>couch potato.</v>

8
00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.420
<v Speaker 1>Nerdwriter bludger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>

9
00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:26.110
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's wrong.</v>

10
00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.910
<v Speaker 1>Blood sugar is the furthest thing from </v>
<v Speaker 1>laziness is dead serious.</v>

11
00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.340
<v Speaker 1>What the hell?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I consider laziness to be the LEX luthor</v>

12
00:00:36.341 --> 00:00:38.200
<v Speaker 1>of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which begs the question,</v>

13
00:00:38.201 --> 00:00:39.034
<v Speaker 1>was kryptonite really the weakness of </v>
<v Speaker 1>superman or was it lex luther or was it </v>

14
00:00:43.541 --> 00:00:45.160
<v Speaker 1>love Ludovic?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Van misstates,</v>

15
00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:46.023
<v Speaker 1>the Austrian economist wrote the </v>
<v Speaker 1>expenditure of labor is deemed painful </v>

16
00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.440
<v Speaker 1>not to work is considered a state of </v>
<v Speaker 1>affairs more satisfactory than working.</v>

17
00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:54.303
<v Speaker 1>Leisure is other things being equal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I prefer to travail people work only </v>

18
00:00:57.521 --> 00:01:02.080
<v Speaker 1>when they value the return of labor </v>
<v Speaker 1>higher than the decrease in satisfaction</v>

19
00:01:02.081 --> 00:01:04.330
<v Speaker 1>brought about by the curtailment of </v>
<v Speaker 1>leisure.</v>

20
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.500
<v Speaker 1>Is that true?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

21
00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:06.483
<v Speaker 1>I remember those days in college when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>had a long paper test to finish and I </v>

22
00:01:10.031 --> 00:01:11.830
<v Speaker 1>thought to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I just finished this,</v>

23
00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.330
<v Speaker 1>I'll have three or four days where I </v>
<v Speaker 1>won't have to do anything and it will be</v>

24
00:01:16.331 --> 00:01:19.090
<v Speaker 1>glorious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was living for the gaps as it were,</v>

25
00:01:19.091 --> 00:01:23.560
<v Speaker 1>those times when I could just be lazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and even now having worked at a real job</v>

26
00:01:23.561 --> 00:01:24.394
<v Speaker 1>for some time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm beginning to learn the meaning of </v>

27
00:01:25.601 --> 00:01:27.400
<v Speaker 1>that classic Loverboy Song.</v>

28
00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.660
<v Speaker 1>Don't get me wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a great job,</v>

29
00:01:31.661 --> 00:01:32.494
<v Speaker 1>but it's still work and there are times </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I find myself daydreaming about my </v>

30
00:01:35.801 --> 00:01:37.990
<v Speaker 1>couch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my boxers,</v>

31
00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:39.543
<v Speaker 1>Jersey shore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always felt like this laziness </v>

32
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.393
<v Speaker 1>wasn't me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it was some disease I had </v>

33
00:01:44.081 --> 00:01:46.600
<v Speaker 1>contracted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like my bad work ethic was the result of</v>

34
00:01:46.601 --> 00:01:49.630
<v Speaker 1>being spoiled as a kid or the coddling </v>
<v Speaker 1>of contemporary society.</v>

35
00:01:49.631 --> 00:01:51.910
<v Speaker 1>I felt this way because I couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>change it.</v>

36
00:01:51.911 --> 00:01:52.744
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't excise it from myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All I had was my fear of failure to </v>

37
00:01:56.471 --> 00:01:58.180
<v Speaker 1>fight it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when you graduate from school,</v>

38
00:01:58.181 --> 00:02:00.220
<v Speaker 1>when the educational system spits you </v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

39
00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.280
<v Speaker 1>it dawns on you that if you don't make </v>
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>

40
00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.923
<v Speaker 1>you're going to become homeless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course you might be lucky enough to </v>

41
00:02:07.301 --> 00:02:08.800
<v Speaker 1>have parents to help you out part of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

42
00:02:08.801 --> 00:02:11.200
<v Speaker 1>but unless you're inheriting a large </v>
<v Speaker 1>fortune,</v>

43
00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.090
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have to figure it out </v>
<v Speaker 1>for yourself.</v>

44
00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.400
<v Speaker 1>At that point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can still use the fear of failure to</v>

45
00:02:15.401 --> 00:02:17.830
<v Speaker 1>guide you or you can use the </v>
<v Speaker 1>disappointment of others,</v>

46
00:02:17.831 --> 00:02:18.664
<v Speaker 1>or you can find something that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>really love that doesn't seem like work </v>

47
00:02:21.131 --> 00:02:21.964
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never underestimate the power of not </v>

48
00:02:23.681 --> 00:02:24.514
<v Speaker 1>wanting to disappoint your mother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hard work is considered by almost </v>

49
00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.090
<v Speaker 1>everyone a virtue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but laziness may in fact be our nature.</v>

50
00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.073
<v Speaker 1>A lot of animals are just lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They only get what they need and they </v>

51
00:02:34.091 --> 00:02:35.610
<v Speaker 1>just lounge around for the rest of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

52
00:02:35.611 --> 00:02:39.070
<v Speaker 1>but theories abound which give Leisure </v>
<v Speaker 1>and laziness more credit.</v>

53
00:02:39.071 --> 00:02:41.170
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in ecclesiastics 14,</v>

54
00:02:41.171 --> 00:02:42.004
<v Speaker 1>it says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wisdom is good together with an </v>

55
00:02:43.271 --> 00:02:44.104
<v Speaker 1>inheritance or Schopenhauer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the man to whom nature and fate have </v>

56
00:02:46.391 --> 00:02:47.224
<v Speaker 1>granted the blessing of wisdom will be </v>
<v Speaker 1>most anxious and careful to keep open </v>

57
00:02:50.591 --> 00:02:55.591
<v Speaker 1>the fountains of happiness which he has </v>
<v Speaker 1>in himself and for this independence and</v>

58
00:02:55.601 --> 00:02:56.434
<v Speaker 1>leisure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or necessarily the point is that </v>

59
00:02:57.851 --> 00:02:58.684
<v Speaker 1>leisure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those hours when don't have to work for </v>

60
00:03:00.251 --> 00:03:03.370
<v Speaker 1>our bread may be the best for </v>
<v Speaker 1>inspiration.</v>

61
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.010
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the modern economy echoes that sentiment</v>

62
00:03:06.011 --> 00:03:07.480
<v Speaker 1>somewhat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The virtuous phrase,</v>

63
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:12.570
<v Speaker 1>work hard has almost totally been </v>
<v Speaker 1>replaced with worksmart or work uniquely</v>

64
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.220
<v Speaker 1>many like those in the web development </v>
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>

65
00:03:15.221 --> 00:03:18.160
<v Speaker 1>Use Leisure to their business advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be sure the terms,</v>

66
00:03:18.161 --> 00:03:20.800
<v Speaker 1>Leisure and laziness have nuances of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own.</v>

67
00:03:20.801 --> 00:03:21.634
<v Speaker 1>Suffice it to say that complete laziness</v>
<v Speaker 1>won't sustain and total leisure doesn't </v>

68
00:03:25.901 --> 00:03:29.620
<v Speaker 1>exist in the realm of practical life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It comes down to a dualistic mantra.</v>

69
00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:31.900
<v Speaker 1>Be Happy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make money,</v>

70
00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:35.003
<v Speaker 1>avoid.</v>

71
00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.100
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>daily grace.</v>

72
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.500
<v Speaker 1>We both know you're getting my tweets to</v>
<v Speaker 1>collaborate,</v>

73
00:03:41.501 --> 00:03:42.334
<v Speaker 1>so what I'm going to do now is enlist </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the viewers watching this video to </v>

74
00:03:44.831 --> 00:03:47.350
<v Speaker 1>tweet daily grace to collaborate with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the nerdwriter.</v>

75
00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:48.370
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

76
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:49.203
<v Speaker 1>because I'm handsome because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>charming because I'm well at the moment </v>

77
00:03:52.601 --> 00:03:53.434
<v Speaker 1>I'm Gassy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't consider that powerhouse in </v>

78
00:03:55.541 --> 00:03:57.550
<v Speaker 1>the kitchen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mediocre at basketball,</v>

79
00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.420
<v Speaker 1>the most sonorous high fives you've ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>received.</v>

80
00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.350
<v Speaker 1>I have a heart of gold and I desperately</v>
<v Speaker 1>need surgery.</v>

81
00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.680
<v Speaker 1>I've been known to give massages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

82
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:09.480
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's wrong.</v>

83
00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.830
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like massage.</v>

84
00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:11.710
<v Speaker 1>Can you give me a massage?</v>
