1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
<v Speaker 1>So this is the last blog I'm going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing in this apartment.</v>

2
00:00:02.821 --> 00:00:03.654
<v Speaker 1>I'm moving out of here next week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So say goodbye to the beautiful brick </v>

3
00:00:06.151 --> 00:00:11.060
<v Speaker 1>wall that I love so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also coffee on a Tuesday and flogged.</v>

4
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:11.933
<v Speaker 1>Fifty nine.</v>

5
00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:23.210
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

6
00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.043
<v Speaker 1>Nationally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've dealt with our share of tragedies </v>

7
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.130
<v Speaker 1>in recent months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Last October,</v>

8
00:00:28.131 --> 00:00:31.700
<v Speaker 1>Hurricane Sandy caused an estimated </v>
<v Speaker 1>$71,000,000,000</v>

9
00:00:31.701 --> 00:00:32.534
<v Speaker 1>in damage to the east coast in December.</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 children were shot and killed at </v>

10
00:00:36.531 --> 00:00:38.660
<v Speaker 1>Sandy Hook elementary in Connecticut in </v>
<v Speaker 1>April.</v>

11
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:39.673
<v Speaker 1>Two bombs were set off at the Boston </v>
<v Speaker 1>marathon and just last week a massive </v>

12
00:00:43.281 --> 00:00:47.930
<v Speaker 1>tornado literally uprooted and Oklahoma </v>
<v Speaker 1>town killing 24 internationally.</v>

13
00:00:47.931 --> 00:00:48.764
<v Speaker 1>There are of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tragedies beyond counting for some such </v>

14
00:00:51.801 --> 00:00:52.634
<v Speaker 1>tragedies are a way of life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a daily affair for those who have </v>

15
00:00:55.341 --> 00:00:58.040
<v Speaker 1>experienced the paint,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the residents at the Jersey shore,</v>

16
00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:58.883
<v Speaker 1>the parents of the children at Newtown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the marathon runners who trained and </v>

17
00:01:02.181 --> 00:01:03.014
<v Speaker 1>trained and were robbed in violence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their triumph there opens up beneath </v>

18
00:01:06.291 --> 00:01:07.124
<v Speaker 1>them a new basement of feeling which </v>
<v Speaker 1>many of us cannot and hopefully we'll </v>

19
00:01:10.971 --> 00:01:13.280
<v Speaker 1>never know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>such pain in this country,</v>

20
00:01:13.281 --> 00:01:16.940
<v Speaker 1>especially in those relatively safe </v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhoods like the one I grew up in,</v>

21
00:01:16.941 --> 00:01:18.440
<v Speaker 1>must be alienating.</v>

22
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.750
<v Speaker 1>I've never experienced intense </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering,</v>

23
00:01:20.751 --> 00:01:24.050
<v Speaker 1>never seen death or had someone very </v>
<v Speaker 1>close to me die.</v>

24
00:01:24.051 --> 00:01:28.550
<v Speaker 1>So by what language could the victim </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate to me,</v>

25
00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.660
<v Speaker 1>his sorrow?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What responsibility do I have to feel,</v>

26
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.513
<v Speaker 1>and what responsibility do I have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel the day to day suffering for those </v>

27
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:41.260
<v Speaker 1>in parts of the world to whom such deep </v>
<v Speaker 1>pain is not alienating but inclusionary.</v>

28
00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.110
<v Speaker 1>For a short time after college,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I studied philosophy and I've found that</v>

29
00:01:45.111 --> 00:01:49.940
<v Speaker 1>the more I read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more reading seemed insufficient.</v>

30
00:01:49.941 --> 00:01:54.530
<v Speaker 1>I was studying philosophy to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>what to do and ironically,</v>

31
00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:58.070
<v Speaker 1>as the concept of truth became </v>
<v Speaker 1>increasingly murky to me,</v>

32
00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:03.370
<v Speaker 1>how to act became increasingly playing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only thing really worth doing,</v>

33
00:02:03.411 --> 00:02:06.140
<v Speaker 1>I've found was helping other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

34
00:02:06.141 --> 00:02:09.920
<v Speaker 1>people need help in a variety of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Stardust memories.</v>

35
00:02:09.921 --> 00:02:10.580
<v Speaker 1>Woody Allen's</v>

36
00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:11.440
<v Speaker 3>says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>excuse me,</v>

37
00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:12.693
<v Speaker 3>you don't have enough to eat or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something that becomes a major problem </v>

38
00:02:15.111 --> 00:02:15.944
<v Speaker 3>in has become very clear cut,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what happens if you're living in a </v>

39
00:02:18.071 --> 00:02:18.904
<v Speaker 3>more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

40
00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:19.743
<v Speaker 3>a more affluent society and you're lucky</v>
<v Speaker 3>enough to to not have to worry about </v>

41
00:02:22.571 --> 00:02:23.680
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's say you're surviving,</v>

42
00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.390
<v Speaker 3>so then you problems become,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how can I fall in love or why can't they</v>

43
00:02:28.391 --> 00:02:29.224
<v Speaker 3>fall in love more accurately and why do </v>
<v Speaker 3>I age and die and what meaning can my </v>

44
00:02:33.981 --> 00:02:37.750
<v Speaker 3>life possibly have?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The issues become very complex for,</v>

45
00:02:37.751 --> 00:02:38.584
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a guy that makes a lot of funny </v>

46
00:02:39.941 --> 00:02:41.910
<v Speaker 3>movies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're kind of a depressive.</v>

47
00:02:41.911 --> 00:02:42.340
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

48
00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.100
<v Speaker 1>Alan is describing mazlow's hierarchy of</v>
<v Speaker 1>needs,</v>

49
00:02:45.101 --> 00:02:45.934
<v Speaker 1>a hierarchical list of our human needs </v>
<v Speaker 1>often shown as a pyramid from our most </v>

50
00:02:49.961 --> 00:02:54.730
<v Speaker 1>fundamental to our most complex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from our physiological needs of food and</v>

51
00:02:54.731 --> 00:02:56.740
<v Speaker 1>shelter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to our need of safety,</v>

52
00:02:56.741 --> 00:02:58.450
<v Speaker 1>of friendship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>self esteem,</v>

53
00:02:58.451 --> 00:03:03.320
<v Speaker 1>and finally of self actualization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our needs of creativity and morale.</v>

54
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:04.203
<v Speaker 1>The idea is that one cannot ascend the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pyramid until the needs of lower orders </v>

55
00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:12.730
<v Speaker 1>are satisfied as a novelist and Vlogger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as one with food,</v>

56
00:03:12.731 --> 00:03:13.900
<v Speaker 1>shelter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>safety,</v>

57
00:03:13.901 --> 00:03:15.250
<v Speaker 1>self-esteem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>friends,</v>

58
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.790
<v Speaker 1>I aim to treat issues of self </v>
<v Speaker 1>actualization for myself and others.</v>

59
00:03:20.831 --> 00:03:24.640
<v Speaker 1>That's what this blog is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's also a choice.</v>

60
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:25.503
<v Speaker 1>It means that my experience in its </v>
<v Speaker 1>attempts at profundity will be holy and </v>

61
00:03:30.041 --> 00:03:30.874
<v Speaker 1>necessarily different from mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is Sean Ahmed of the uncultured </v>

62
00:03:34.961 --> 00:03:35.794
<v Speaker 1>project.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sean withdrew from Grad School after </v>

63
00:03:37.301 --> 00:03:40.630
<v Speaker 1>hearing a speech by Dr Jeffrey Sachs </v>
<v Speaker 1>about poverty.</v>

64
00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.160
<v Speaker 1>He liquidated his savings and left his </v>
<v Speaker 1>life to start a project in which he uses</v>

65
00:03:45.161 --> 00:03:49.420
<v Speaker 1>technology and the web to bring those in</v>
<v Speaker 1>need together with what they need.</v>

66
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:50.283
<v Speaker 1>Teaming up with various organizations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sean has provided clean water to </v>

67
00:03:52.871 --> 00:03:54.610
<v Speaker 1>villages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rebuilt a high school,</v>

68
00:03:54.611 --> 00:03:55.444
<v Speaker 1>destroyed by a psych loan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>provided emergency relief in multiple </v>

69
00:03:58.451 --> 00:03:59.284
<v Speaker 1>disaster areas and helped over 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>children through longterm health worker </v>

70
00:04:03.551 --> 00:04:04.120
<v Speaker 1>programs.</v>

71
00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.080
<v Speaker 4>I just returned from Bangladesh where </v>
<v Speaker 4>two major events happened.</v>

72
00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.320
<v Speaker 4>First was the garment factory collapse,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which killed over 1000,</v>

73
00:04:11.321 --> 00:04:12.154
<v Speaker 4>100 people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Also episodes of Muslim extremist </v>

74
00:04:14.291 --> 00:04:15.124
<v Speaker 4>violence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

75
00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.880
<v Speaker 4>which over a quarter million Muslim </v>
<v Speaker 4>extremist congregated in the city.</v>

76
00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.810
<v Speaker 4>There were clashes with security forces </v>
<v Speaker 4>in many.</v>

77
00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.720
<v Speaker 4>What I'm feeling right now are </v>
<v Speaker 4>Bangladeshis,</v>

78
00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:25.990
<v Speaker 4>resilience to tragedy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's very hard to talk about this in</v>

79
00:04:25.991 --> 00:04:26.824
<v Speaker 4>a way that doesn't romanticize the poor </v>
<v Speaker 4>or those suffering because in many </v>

80
00:04:30.851 --> 00:04:31.684
<v Speaker 4>respects,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because they can handle it or they seem </v>

81
00:04:33.701 --> 00:04:35.230
<v Speaker 4>to be handling it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I couldn't.</v>

82
00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.040
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes it makes me feel like I should</v>
<v Speaker 4>put them on a pedestal for me.</v>

83
00:04:39.041 --> 00:04:39.874
<v Speaker 4>I can actually have a normal day and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then I could go to an h and m and then </v>

84
00:04:43.271 --> 00:04:46.570
<v Speaker 4>all of a sudden I'm getting flashbacks </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the garment factory collapse.</v>

85
00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.930
<v Speaker 4>Or I can watch a movie where people die </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they get flashbacks of the more.</v>

86
00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.090
<v Speaker 4>I saw corpses from the Muslim </v>
<v Speaker 4>extremists.</v>

87
00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.073
<v Speaker 4>We're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

88
00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:57.333
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's not show them just to keep it on </v>

89
00:04:59.271 --> 00:05:00.860
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sean is livid.</v>

90
00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:02.870
<v Speaker 1>The conclusion I came to a few years </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>

91
00:05:02.871 --> 00:05:03.704
<v Speaker 1>a conclusion that I entertained in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>comfort of my largely painless </v>

92
00:05:06.891 --> 00:05:07.724
<v Speaker 1>existence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one which I did not see through for </v>

93
00:05:11.151 --> 00:05:14.720
<v Speaker 1>reasons of family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vocation and cowardice.</v>

94
00:05:14.721 --> 00:05:15.554
<v Speaker 1>To see what maslow doesn't cover is </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not it's okay to ascend the </v>

95
00:05:19.821 --> 00:05:20.654
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy of needs when just one other </v>
<v Speaker 1>person with whom you share the world </v>

96
00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.790
<v Speaker 1>lacks the fundamentals of life for any </v>
<v Speaker 1>need of a lower order.</v>

97
00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:29.643
<v Speaker 1>When people ask me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tell them that I'm a writer because I </v>

98
00:05:32.331 --> 00:05:33.164
<v Speaker 1>feel I have a knack for it because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>believed that I could add something </v>

99
00:05:37.071 --> 00:05:39.410
<v Speaker 1>significant to the history of </v>
<v Speaker 1>literature.</v>

100
00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.910
<v Speaker 1>About 60 percent of me believes that </v>
<v Speaker 1>more or less by turns.</v>

101
00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:44.773
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these things don't have to be mutually </v>

102
00:05:46.251 --> 00:05:47.450
<v Speaker 1>exclusive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The vlog brothers,</v>

103
00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:48.553
<v Speaker 1>self actualizer is if there ever were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have raised millions of dollars for </v>

104
00:05:52.251 --> 00:05:56.090
<v Speaker 1>charities through Kiva Dot Com and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>project for awesome last year.</v>

105
00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:57.163
<v Speaker 1>$14 of that project for awesome money </v>
<v Speaker 1>went to kids in need of desks in Milan </v>

106
00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.100
<v Speaker 1>this year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tens of thousands of dollars.</v>

107
00:06:04.101 --> 00:06:04.934
<v Speaker 1>These go into the uncultured project.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These things make a real difference in </v>

108
00:06:08.031 --> 00:06:11.840
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now I will return to my videos in my</v>

109
00:06:11.841 --> 00:06:15.020
<v Speaker 1>writing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sean will return to his hands on work in</v>

110
00:06:15.021 --> 00:06:18.320
<v Speaker 1>Bangladesh and though sat just inches </v>
<v Speaker 1>apart.</v>

111
00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:22.130
<v Speaker 1>We are separated by a Gulf of </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience,</v>

112
00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:23.173
<v Speaker 1>a Gulf of pain and suffering and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sensory knowledge of privileges that </v>

113
00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:32.050
<v Speaker 1>feel to me like mere facts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a golf which I cannot cross.</v>

114
00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:37.730
<v Speaker 1>Let me go for which many in Bangladesh </v>
<v Speaker 1>and to some extent me can never cross.</v>

115
00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:47.910
<v Speaker 5>Hey everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Thanks for watching.</v>

116
00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:48.953
