1
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:03.893
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing how much of our modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>political morality is influenced by the </v>

2
00:00:08.971 --> 00:00:13.860
<v Speaker 1>philosopher John Stuart Mill and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mill wasn't the first person to champion</v>

3
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:18.510
<v Speaker 1>individual freedom of choice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the case he makes in on liberty,</v>

4
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.570
<v Speaker 1>his most famous work is like a diamond </v>
<v Speaker 1>of thought put most succinctly.</v>

5
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.780
<v Speaker 1>He says that over himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>over his own body and mind.</v>

6
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:28.643
<v Speaker 1>The individual is sovereign and if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to understand the complex issue of </v>

7
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.800
<v Speaker 1>who has the right to die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to start here because it's this</v>

8
00:00:37.801 --> 00:00:42.210
<v Speaker 1>principle of personal autonomy except in</v>
<v Speaker 1>cases where opposes harm to others.</v>

9
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.860
<v Speaker 1>That forms it's moral and legal basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In American courts,</v>

10
00:00:46.861 --> 00:00:47.694
<v Speaker 1>at least the possession of that autonomy</v>
<v Speaker 1>has become synonymous with the word </v>

11
00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:52.283
<v Speaker 1>dignity and words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Terms in this debate have a lot of </v>

12
00:00:55.591 --> 00:00:56.424
<v Speaker 1>importance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They framed the way we think of the </v>

13
00:00:58.021 --> 00:01:00.780
<v Speaker 1>question of doctor assisted suicide in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the beginning.</v>

14
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.330
<v Speaker 1>It was called euthanasia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In 1938,</v>

15
00:01:03.331 --> 00:01:07.740
<v Speaker 1>Dr Charles Francis Potter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a unitarian priest and humanists founded</v>

16
00:01:07.741 --> 00:01:08.574
<v Speaker 1>the euthanasia society of America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first group to seriously proposed </v>

17
00:01:11.641 --> 00:01:15.180
<v Speaker 1>legislation that would legalize mercy </v>
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>

18
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.260
<v Speaker 1>At least that's what the New York Times </v>
<v Speaker 1>called the euthanasia society,</v>

19
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.153
<v Speaker 1>didn't like the terms death and killing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they preferred merciful release of </v>

20
00:01:24.871 --> 00:01:25.704
<v Speaker 1>course for much of the public,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the term euthanasia was already a bit </v>

21
00:01:28.261 --> 00:01:29.094
<v Speaker 1>too close to Eugenics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that the Nazis were going to </v>

22
00:01:32.011 --> 00:01:32.844
<v Speaker 1>make disgustingly clear in the next few </v>
<v Speaker 1>years and the society wasn't doing much </v>

23
00:01:36.511 --> 00:01:39.210
<v Speaker 1>distinguishing itself and the words of </v>
<v Speaker 1>its president,</v>

24
00:01:39.211 --> 00:01:44.211
<v Speaker 1>euthanasia was for born defectives who </v>
<v Speaker 1>were doomed to remain defective.</v>

25
00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.980
<v Speaker 1>If that terrifies you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it should.</v>

26
00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.263
<v Speaker 1>So for those who saw a genuine moral </v>
<v Speaker 1>imperative to help terminal sufferers </v>

27
00:01:52.351 --> 00:01:55.440
<v Speaker 1>and their life on their terms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was an uphill battle.</v>

28
00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.180
<v Speaker 1>And that battle too was waged in words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In 1976,</v>

29
00:02:00.181 --> 00:02:01.014
<v Speaker 1>the euthanasia society of America </v>
<v Speaker 1>changed their name to the Society for </v>

30
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.390
<v Speaker 1>the right to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In 1992,</v>

31
00:02:06.391 --> 00:02:09.990
<v Speaker 1>they changed it again to choice in died </v>
<v Speaker 1>in 1993,</v>

32
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.480
<v Speaker 1>another group form called compassion in </v>
<v Speaker 1>dying.</v>

33
00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.343
<v Speaker 1>And in 2002,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the former hemlock society changed its </v>

34
00:02:15.331 --> 00:02:18.660
<v Speaker 1>name to end of life choices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>

35
00:02:18.661 --> 00:02:23.661
<v Speaker 1>merging with compassion and dying in </v>
<v Speaker 1>2003 to form compassion and choices.</v>

36
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.660
<v Speaker 1>You can see during a process of decades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a careful reframing of the debate as one</v>

37
00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.160
<v Speaker 1>about choice and personal autonomy.</v>

38
00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.260
<v Speaker 2>I cosmo Kramer having just seen the </v>
<v Speaker 2>movie the other side of darkness and not</v>

39
00:02:37.861 --> 00:02:38.694
<v Speaker 2>wanting to be in a coma like that lady </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the movie hereby want Jerry Seinfeld </v>

40
00:02:43.411 --> 00:02:45.600
<v Speaker 2>to remove my life support,</v>
<v Speaker 2>feeding machine,</v>

41
00:02:45.601 --> 00:02:47.230
<v Speaker 2>lung blower,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera,</v>

42
00:02:47.231 --> 00:02:49.140
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>

43
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.560
<v Speaker 2>First</v>

44
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.393
<v Speaker 1>victories came in the form of advanced </v>
<v Speaker 1>care directives or living wills and the </v>

45
00:02:54.211 --> 00:02:55.044
<v Speaker 1>court decisions were loaded with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>language of autonomy and dignity to </v>

46
00:02:58.171 --> 00:03:01.570
<v Speaker 1>justify pulling the plug in the case of </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain death.</v>

47
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.060
<v Speaker 1>And then when the first physician </v>
<v Speaker 1>assisted death,</v>

48
00:03:04.061 --> 00:03:06.790
<v Speaker 1>laws were passed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dignity was front and center again.</v>

49
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.970
<v Speaker 1>Indeed such laws are often called death </v>
<v Speaker 1>with dignity laws.</v>

50
00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:11.283
<v Speaker 1>Today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five states effectively allow physician </v>

51
00:03:13.091 --> 00:03:13.924
<v Speaker 1>assisted death and in each,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the medication can only be prescribed </v>

52
00:03:16.211 --> 00:03:18.430
<v Speaker 1>when certain requirements are met.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Oregon,</v>

53
00:03:18.431 --> 00:03:19.540
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to,</v>

54
00:03:19.541 --> 00:03:23.110
<v Speaker 1>among other things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be terminally ill with a fatal diagnosis</v>

55
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.730
<v Speaker 1>of less than six months.</v>

56
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.250
<v Speaker 3>The day that I learned that I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>terminally ill,</v>

57
00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.590
<v Speaker 3>that there was nothing that medicine </v>
<v Speaker 3>could do to ameliorate even my symptoms.</v>

58
00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:36.283
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I decided that I wanted to live as long </v>

59
00:03:41.281 --> 00:03:45.270
<v Speaker 3>as I could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as best I was able and I want her to die</v>

60
00:03:45.271 --> 00:03:47.280
<v Speaker 3>with dignity with which I had lived.</v>

61
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.290
<v Speaker 1>It's an extraordinary issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Physician assisted death.</v>

62
00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:51.423
<v Speaker 1>It's legal victories have been carved </v>
<v Speaker 1>carefully from a complex and dangerous </v>

63
00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:56.283
<v Speaker 1>moral backdrop in a country where </v>
<v Speaker 1>depression rates are as high as this </v>

64
00:03:59.021 --> 00:03:59.854
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not without risk to sanction any </v>

65
00:04:01.601 --> 00:04:05.440
<v Speaker 1>form of suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Death with dignity laws limit themselves</v>

66
00:04:05.441 --> 00:04:06.274
<v Speaker 1>to terminally ill patients exclusively </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's the only instance in which </v>

67
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.030
<v Speaker 1>we can recognize irrational desire to </v>
<v Speaker 1>end one's own life and all other cases.</v>

68
00:04:15.311 --> 00:04:19.480
<v Speaker 1>Suicide is a permanent solution to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>temporary problem.</v>

69
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:20.703
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>opponents of physician assisted death </v>

70
00:04:21.971 --> 00:04:25.000
<v Speaker 1>don't see a moral right in any instance </v>
<v Speaker 1>of suicide.</v>

71
00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.893
<v Speaker 1>A lot of those opponents fall on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative or religious side of the </v>

72
00:04:28.511 --> 00:04:31.240
<v Speaker 1>spectrum where there's also a split </v>
<v Speaker 1>among progressives,</v>

73
00:04:31.241 --> 00:04:34.480
<v Speaker 1>particularly on the part of disability </v>
<v Speaker 1>rights activists.</v>

74
00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.010
<v Speaker 1>When those seeking aid and dying lists </v>
<v Speaker 1>the reasons for their choice reasons,</v>

75
00:04:39.011 --> 00:04:42.850
<v Speaker 1>such as the inability to live without </v>
<v Speaker 1>help being a burden on their loved ones,</v>

76
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.560
<v Speaker 1>things often refer to as indignities </v>
<v Speaker 1>activist.</v>

77
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.393
<v Speaker 1>Point out that those with disability </v>
<v Speaker 1>live with such conditions for their </v>

78
00:04:51.161 --> 00:04:51.994
<v Speaker 1>entire life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say that physician assisted death </v>

79
00:04:54.131 --> 00:04:54.964
<v Speaker 1>laws can paint these kinds of lives as </v>
<v Speaker 1>undignified and that creates a larger </v>

80
00:04:59.231 --> 00:05:00.064
<v Speaker 1>culture that the values the disabled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what happens when an abstract </v>

81
00:05:04.301 --> 00:05:05.134
<v Speaker 1>concept like dignity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a concept that has no fixed meaning in </v>

82
00:05:07.871 --> 00:05:10.870
<v Speaker 1>bioethics is invested with so much </v>
<v Speaker 1>weight.</v>

83
00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:12.093
<v Speaker 1>80 one percent of people who seek lethal</v>
<v Speaker 1>medication do so because they worry </v>

84
00:05:15.671 --> 00:05:18.010
<v Speaker 1>about a quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>loss of dignity,</v>

85
00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.210
<v Speaker 1>and yet whether dignity is a property </v>
<v Speaker 1>that can be lost.</v>

86
00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.700
<v Speaker 1>It's still a matter of philosophical </v>
<v Speaker 1>debate.</v>

87
00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.893
<v Speaker 1>I should say now that physician assisted</v>
<v Speaker 1>death is something that I support but </v>

88
00:05:29.441 --> 00:05:32.620
<v Speaker 1>not without a little hesitation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hesitation that's demanded.</v>

89
00:05:32.621 --> 00:05:36.460
<v Speaker 1>I think by the blurred boundaries of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>moral question like this one.</v>

90
00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.843
<v Speaker 1>The objections posed by conservatives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>disability rights activists and others </v>

91
00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:44.140
<v Speaker 1>must be taken into account.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't negate.</v>

92
00:05:44.141 --> 00:05:44.974
<v Speaker 1>It's neat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they do warn us that discussion </v>

93
00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.050
<v Speaker 1>across the table isn't for going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>draft laws.</v>

94
00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:55.110
<v Speaker 1>As subtle as the issue is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mine is the morality of John Stuart Mill</v>

95
00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:56.643
<v Speaker 1>in 2015 at only the latest moment in our</v>
<v Speaker 1>effort to understand the intricacies of </v>

96
00:06:01.371 --> 00:06:06.371
<v Speaker 1>individual liberty and at the heart of </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberty is the right to define one's own</v>

97
00:06:07.071 --> 00:06:09.860
<v Speaker 1>concept of existence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of meaning,</v>

98
00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:10.723
<v Speaker 1>of the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of the mystery of human life and </v>

99
00:06:14.991 --> 00:06:15.824
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>

100
00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:19.370
<v Speaker 1>Hey everybody.</v>
