00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:29.453
<v Speaker 1>That would be like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I must say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>

27
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.730
<v Speaker 2>Television has a strange power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially in American culture.</v>

28
00:01:44.731 --> 00:01:45.564
<v Speaker 2>It lends credibility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instant credibility to people that </v>

29
00:01:48.691 --> 00:01:51.710
<v Speaker 2>sometimes don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely true.</v>

30
00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.150

<v Speaker 2>are.</v>

41
00:02:32.431 --> 00:02:33.264
<v Speaker 2>I can see myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I have asked them to turn off </v>

42
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.970
<v Speaker 2>because as I said that my first flog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I cannot not look at myself.</v>

43
00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.093
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we're waiting right now listening to </v>

44
00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.460
<v Speaker 2>Melissa do the show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she's going to,</v>

45
00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:45.810
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh.</v>

46
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:47.183
<v Speaker 3>Hi Evan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How are you?</v>

47
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:48.120
<v Speaker 3>Good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how are you,</v>

48
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.953
<v Speaker 3>Melissa?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

49
00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.620
<v Speaker 3>we were absolutely blown away by your </v>
<v Speaker 3>video.</v>

50
00:02:52.621 --> 00:02:53.454
<v Speaker 3>Can I tell you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had been emailing it to one another </v>

51
00:02:54.901 --> 00:02:58.470
<v Speaker 3>and playing it over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What inspired you to make it?</v>

52
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.033
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

53
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.440
<v Speaker 2>I was watching last night when Lauren </v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

54
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was the simplicity of the idea and I,</v>

55
00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.610
<v Speaker 2>I completely agree with that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's that plus the fact that</v>

56
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.130
<v Speaker 2>it's something that you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't think of,</v>

57
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:13.263
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's what struck me when I </v>

58
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.960
<v Speaker 2>originally heard them announce it a year</v>
<v Speaker 2>ago on the show,</v>

59
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.360
<v Speaker 2>is it something that you never think of?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it sort of hits you in that,</v>

60
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.180
<v Speaker 2>that feel bad Oregon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever that is.</v>

61
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.313
<v Speaker 2>And you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get that reflexive feeling like he </v>

62
00:03:26.111 --> 00:03:27.430
<v Speaker 2>said last night to donate.</v>

63
00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.540
<v Speaker 3>So it was uploaded five days ago and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you've gotten more than 200,000</v>

64
00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.320
<v Speaker 3>hits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is,</v>

65
00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.130
<v Speaker 3>what has been the reaction you've been </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting from people online who have seen</v>

66
00:03:37.131 --> 00:03:37.610
<v Speaker 3>it?</v>

67
00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.660
<v Speaker 2>The reaction has been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I use the word aggressively generous.</v>

68
00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:42.723
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The comments just on the video has been </v>

69
00:03:45.021 --> 00:03:49.070
<v Speaker 2>like donated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just say donate or they say,</v>

70
00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.093
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just took a kid off the floor and </v>

71
00:03:51.051 --> 00:03:54.550
<v Speaker 2>Malawi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to know that you could possibly kind</v>

72
00:03:54.551 --> 00:03:57.410
<v Speaker 2>of do make that effect in the world by </v>
<v Speaker 2>making a video is it,</v>

73
00:03:57.411 --> 00:03:58.250
<v Speaker 2>is truly incredible.</v>

74
00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:59.660
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>speaking of that,</v>

75
00:03:59.661 --> 00:04:01.730
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's a small,</v>
<v Speaker 3>small thing and desks.</v>

76
00:04:01.731 --> 00:04:03.440
<v Speaker 3>It's a small thing to make a video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

77
00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.680
<v Speaker 3>So what is your ultimate goal though?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you have this small thing,</v>

78
00:04:06.681 --> 00:04:10.370
<v Speaker 3>but then you have a video that </v>
<v Speaker 3>Crescendos to winning the Nobel prize.</v>

79
00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:12.300
<v Speaker 3>What was your Christian?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

80
00:04:12.301 --> 00:04:12.771
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

81
00:04:12.771 --> 00:04:14.300
<v Speaker 3>what would you like this video to do?</v>

82
00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.920
<v Speaker 2>What I would like it to do is it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

83
00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:20.140
<v Speaker 2>it was a video for the project for </v>
<v Speaker 2>awesome,</v>

84
00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:21.123
<v Speaker 2>which is a youtube charity event that </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens every year where people make </v>

85
00:04:25.001 --> 00:04:27.160
<v Speaker 2>videos on the charity of their choice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They submit them,</v>

86
00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:28.203
<v Speaker 2>the community watches them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hosted by John and Hank Green of </v>

87
00:04:30.701 --> 00:04:31.534
<v Speaker 2>the vlog brothers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just have a lot of people at their </v>

88
00:04:32.771 --> 00:04:36.100
<v Speaker 2>disposal online and we all donated to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the project for awesome.</v>

89
00:04:36.101 --> 00:04:36.934
<v Speaker 2>I think it raised about $71,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what we're waiting for now is the </v>

90
00:04:41.081 --> 00:04:44.260
<v Speaker 2>top voltage charities are going to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>some of that money.</v>

91
00:04:44.261 --> 00:04:47.140
<v Speaker 2>They're going to be divvied up based on </v>
<v Speaker 2>what the votes are and the ultimate goal</v>

92
00:04:47.141 --> 00:04:47.974
<v Speaker 2>for this is to get some more money for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the kind fund because we could actually </v>

93
00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:55.900
<v Speaker 2>make a huge difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting getting classrooms,</v>

94
00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:56.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just kids,</v>

95
00:04:56.801 --> 00:04:57.850
<v Speaker 2>but classrooms off the floor.</v>

96
00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.780
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then the video is indeed awesome and</v>

99
00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.053

112
00:05:42.721 --> 00:05:44.880
