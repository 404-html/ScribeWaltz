1
00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.950
<v Speaker 1>We have people coming into our country </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are looking to do tremendous harm.</v>

2
00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.360
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One year ago today,</v>

3
00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.620
<v Speaker 1>I did my best to explore the way Donald </v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump answers a question.</v>

4
00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:18.783
<v Speaker 1>His use of language in speech I thought </v>
<v Speaker 1>was fascinating and unique and </v>

5
00:00:21.821 --> 00:00:22.654
<v Speaker 1>illuminated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why he's so successful at selling a </v>

6
00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.540
<v Speaker 1>feeling now that trump has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>president elect for 50 days.</v>

7
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.140
<v Speaker 1>We don't get to hear much of trump's </v>
<v Speaker 1>speech anymore.</v>

8
00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:33.063
<v Speaker 1>His interview appearances are dwindling </v>
<v Speaker 1>and his press conferences or </v>

9
00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:36.523
<v Speaker 1>nonexistent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean he stopped using </v>

10
00:00:38.441 --> 00:00:39.274
<v Speaker 1>and manipulating language these days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The language that trump puts on the </v>

11
00:00:42.311 --> 00:00:45.400
<v Speaker 1>public record and comes largely from </v>
<v Speaker 1>writing,</v>

12
00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.550
<v Speaker 1>specifically from writing on twitter in </v>
<v Speaker 1>140 character notes as of December 29th,</v>

13
00:00:51.521 --> 00:00:52.354
<v Speaker 1>2016,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump has tweeted 221 times as the </v>

14
00:00:55.331 --> 00:00:56.164
<v Speaker 1>president elect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's important to note at the outset </v>

15
00:00:57.701 --> 00:01:00.250
<v Speaker 1>that these tweets come largely from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>few sources.</v>

16
00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:01.810
<v Speaker 1>Thanks to info from the metadata.</v>

17
00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:02.643
<v Speaker 1>We know that of the 221,</v>
<v Speaker 1>153 or 69 percent come from an android </v>

18
00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.500
<v Speaker 1>phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump's personal samsung galaxy 59 or 27</v>

19
00:01:11.501 --> 00:01:12.334
<v Speaker 1>percent come from an iphone and nine or </v>
<v Speaker 1>four percent come from the twitter web </v>

20
00:01:15.981 --> 00:01:19.000
<v Speaker 1>client as in someone typing the tweets </v>
<v Speaker 1>into a computer.</v>

21
00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.863
<v Speaker 1>A number of commentators and data </v>
<v Speaker 1>analysts have surmised that the iphone </v>

22
00:01:22.241 --> 00:01:26.200
<v Speaker 1>tweets are not written by trump himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but by his staff.</v>

23
00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.100
<v Speaker 1>I think that's almost certainly true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at those tweets exclusively,</v>

24
00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.113
<v Speaker 1>you capture all of the announcements and</v>
<v Speaker 1>cabinet picks as well as the holiday </v>

25
00:01:34.481 --> 00:01:38.320
<v Speaker 1>messages and the notes of condolence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those 59 tweets,</v>

26
00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.350
<v Speaker 1>49 share links or are retweets and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>or almost all of them are likely written</v>

27
00:01:43.961 --> 00:01:47.950
<v Speaker 1>by Dan Scavino,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump's director of social media or Brad</v>

28
00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:48.783
<v Speaker 1>Parscale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a website designer turned high level </v>

29
00:01:49.631 --> 00:01:53.560
<v Speaker 1>staffer who trump and trusted with </v>
<v Speaker 1>tweeting for him during the presidential</v>

30
00:01:53.561 --> 00:01:57.760
<v Speaker 1>debates of the 153 tweets that come from</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump's personal samsung.</v>

31
00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.910
<v Speaker 1>Not One shares a link,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's a good rule of thumb.</v>

32
00:02:00.911 --> 00:02:04.000
<v Speaker 1>If you want to determine which tweets </v>
<v Speaker 1>are from him and which aren't.</v>

33
00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.313
<v Speaker 1>The huge majority of the android tweets </v>
<v Speaker 1>are trump's personal thoughts or </v>

34
00:02:08.441 --> 00:02:09.274
<v Speaker 1>reactions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you can split them up in a few </v>

35
00:02:10.601 --> 00:02:11.680
<v Speaker 1>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

36
00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.190
<v Speaker 1>40 of those are positive were </v>
<v Speaker 1>congratulatory and tone.</v>

37
00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.370
<v Speaker 1>Ninety four are negative or critical in </v>
<v Speaker 1>tone and 19 are pretty much neutral like</v>

38
00:02:21.401 --> 00:02:23.200
<v Speaker 1>in a speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One thing trump is really,</v>

39
00:02:23.201 --> 00:02:24.034
<v Speaker 1>really good at is emotionally framing </v>
<v Speaker 1>his tweets and most of them are </v>

40
00:02:27.731 --> 00:02:28.564
<v Speaker 1>emotionally charged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why 87 percent of them are </v>

41
00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.133
<v Speaker 1>negative or positive in tone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump doesn't want a sympathetic reader </v>

42
00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.300
<v Speaker 1>to spend any time at all the ciphering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to feel about what he's saying.</v>

43
00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:41.403
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people have mocked the way he </v>
<v Speaker 1>concludes tweets with one or two word </v>

44
00:02:43.811 --> 00:02:44.644
<v Speaker 1>exclamations like sad or too bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but these punctuations are actually </v>

45
00:02:48.581 --> 00:02:53.110
<v Speaker 1>powerful framing devices that lubricate </v>
<v Speaker 1>the content of his message.</v>

46
00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.940
<v Speaker 1>They also reflect a key insight that </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump has knowingly or unknowingly about</v>

47
00:02:57.941 --> 00:03:00.970
<v Speaker 1>twitter and texting as a form of </v>
<v Speaker 1>communication.</v>

48
00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.700
<v Speaker 1>While tweets are technically a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>writing,</v>

49
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.863
<v Speaker 1>scholars have long theorize that </v>
<v Speaker 1>computer mediated communication more </v>

50
00:03:08.651 --> 00:03:09.484
<v Speaker 1>closely resembles speech than writing </v>
<v Speaker 1>were funky punctuation substitutes for </v>

51
00:03:14.381 --> 00:03:16.450
<v Speaker 1>conversational cues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

52
00:03:16.451 --> 00:03:20.170
<v Speaker 1>every time you see someone extend toward</v>
<v Speaker 1>by adding letters saying,</v>

53
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm so sad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or I love breaking bad,</v>

54
00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:25.443
<v Speaker 1>what they're essentially doing is trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to transmit some emotional content that </v>

55
00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.360
<v Speaker 1>would have existed in face to face </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation,</v>

56
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:32.253
<v Speaker 1>instant messages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>text messages and tweets attract these </v>

57
00:03:34.601 --> 00:03:37.900
<v Speaker 1>speech like qualities and Donald trump </v>
<v Speaker 1>understands this.</v>

58
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.090
<v Speaker 1>While he doesn't extend words with extra</v>
<v Speaker 1>letters,</v>

59
00:03:40.091 --> 00:03:43.460
<v Speaker 1>his punctuation at the end of tweets are</v>
<v Speaker 1>extremely speech.</v>

60
00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:44.333
<v Speaker 1>Slide 50,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of his 153 personal tweets end with </v>

61
00:03:47.021 --> 00:03:49.120
<v Speaker 1>exclamations like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In [inaudible] 95,</v>

62
00:03:49.121 --> 00:03:50.860
<v Speaker 1>there was at least one exclamation </v>
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

63
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.950
<v Speaker 1>Whereas opponents and other politicians </v>
<v Speaker 1>right through twitter,</v>

64
00:03:53.951 --> 00:03:55.110
<v Speaker 1>trump speaks through.</v>

65
00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.930
<v Speaker 1>Instead of asking us to read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he forces us to here,</v>

66
00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.120
<v Speaker 1>but all of this begs the important </v>
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>

67
00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.330
<v Speaker 1>what's the point?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump is no longer a candidate.</v>

68
00:04:04.331 --> 00:04:06.400
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't have to persuade us to vote </v>
<v Speaker 1>for him.</v>

69
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could spend a lot of time looking at</v>

70
00:04:08.891 --> 00:04:09.724
<v Speaker 1>a tweet like this from the president </v>
<v Speaker 1>elect of the United States scratching </v>

71
00:04:12.821 --> 00:04:13.654
<v Speaker 1>your head and you could wonder about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>message or the distraction it causes </v>

72
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:19.990
<v Speaker 1>were the headlines that generates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if that's the way you think,</v>

73
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.180
<v Speaker 1>this man will always baffled you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump doesn't resemble other politicians</v>

74
00:04:25.181 --> 00:04:28.390
<v Speaker 1>on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He resembles the rest of us.</v>

75
00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:29.373
<v Speaker 1>He resembles that person you know on </v>
<v Speaker 1>facebook who was posting all the time </v>

76
00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.033
<v Speaker 1>about how happy they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nice people don't tweet or post because </v>

77
00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.500
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to relay relevant </v>
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

78
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:39.783
<v Speaker 1>They do it to carefully craft their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>identities against some imagined </v>

79
00:04:43.661 --> 00:04:48.040
<v Speaker 1>audience that exists only to reinforce </v>
<v Speaker 1>what they need to believe.</v>

80
00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:49.203
<v Speaker 1>The media and the public act like </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump's tweets contain messages that </v>

81
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.133
<v Speaker 1>were meant to receive when the truth is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that he's not thinking of us at </v>

82
00:04:58.601 --> 00:05:00.460
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you look at it through this lens,</v>

83
00:05:00.461 --> 00:05:02.590
<v Speaker 1>trump's twitter account makes a lot more</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

84
00:05:02.591 --> 00:05:03.424
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense that a lot of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>congratulatory tweets are self </v>

85
00:05:06.401 --> 00:05:10.300
<v Speaker 1>congratulatory and his negative tweets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which account for an astounding majority</v>

86
00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.050
<v Speaker 1>are personal in their attacks and sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>of victimization,</v>

87
00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.100
<v Speaker 1>and it makes sense that we should react </v>
<v Speaker 1>to it so strongly.</v>

88
00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:18.993
<v Speaker 1>We're all in this age of social media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intimately familiar with this kind of </v>

89
00:05:21.761 --> 00:05:24.480
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do it ourselves every day.</v>

90
00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:25.613
<v Speaker 1>What we're not familiar with not yet at </v>
<v Speaker 1>least is this kind of thing from the </v>

91
00:05:29.221 --> 00:05:30.054
<v Speaker 1>most powerful person in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How it will fall out when you hold a </v>

92
00:05:34.021 --> 00:05:38.040
<v Speaker 1>position where even your words </v>
<v Speaker 1>desperately tweeted into the void,</v>

93
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:43.050
<v Speaker 1>have global impact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but give it time and we will be.</v>

94
00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.990
<v Speaker 1>There are going to be tons more at nerd </v>
<v Speaker 1>writer episodes in 2017.</v>

95
00:05:49.991 --> 00:05:54.820
<v Speaker 1>So if you want to join this crazy thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I started five years ago,</v>

96
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.070

<v Speaker 1>and subscribe to channel and you'll</v>

<v Speaker 2>I want to level up the show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make content that you have not seen </v>

99
00:06:06.111 --> 00:06:08.780
<v Speaker 2>anywhere else on youtube or the rest of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world,</v>

100
00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.570
<v Speaker 2>and I'm really excited to bring that to </v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys.</v>

101
00:06:11.571 --> 00:06:12.404
<v Speaker 2>I'm working really hard to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to think crunchy roll for </v>

102
00:06:13.881 --> 00:06:17.150
<v Speaker 2>sponsoring this episode.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you're looking for on Netflix,</v>

104
00:06:20.391 --> 00:06:22.770
<v Speaker 2>you can go to control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the Netflix of animated.</v>

<v Speaker 2>They have hd episodes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of titles,</v>

<v Speaker 2>something areas in Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can get it an hour later on.</v>

107
00:06:27.591 --> 00:06:30.350
<v Speaker 2>Crunchy roll.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to recommend attack on Titan,</v>

00:06:30.351 --> 00:06:32.240

<v Speaker 2>super weird show,</v>
