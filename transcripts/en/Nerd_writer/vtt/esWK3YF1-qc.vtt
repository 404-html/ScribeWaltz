00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:07.970
<v Speaker 1>So I just watched Casey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nice guide to instagram.</v>

3
00:00:10.851 --> 00:00:12.050
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't agree more.</v>

4
00:00:12.051 --> 00:00:13.490
<v Speaker 1>Instagram has become,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:14.473
<v Speaker 1>my favorite social media platform to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for all the reasons you know that he </v>

6
00:00:17.631 --> 00:00:21.860
<v Speaker 1>mentioned that it's pure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>simple unsullied by the information dump</v>

7
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.210
<v Speaker 1>of facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just said dumb,</v>

8
00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.340
<v Speaker 1>but more than being just unsettled by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the volume of facebook.</v>

9
00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.180
<v Speaker 1>It's also free of the performances of </v>
<v Speaker 1>facebook too.</v>

10
00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.900
<v Speaker 1>I've talked about our social media </v>
<v Speaker 1>personalities before in Vlog Twenty,</v>

11
00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.280
<v Speaker 1>70.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Click it right here.</v>

12
00:00:37.281 --> 00:00:38.840
<v Speaker 1>If you want to check that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For instagram,</v>

13
00:00:38.841 --> 00:00:42.680
<v Speaker 1>I personally follow three simple rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three simple donuts and I,</v>

14
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:43.603
<v Speaker 1>I've told these to my friends so I might</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well tell them to you to rule number </v>

15
00:00:45.621 --> 00:00:48.680
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't take pictures of yourself.</v>

16
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.090
<v Speaker 1>Rule number two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't take pictures of food.</v>

17
00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.060
<v Speaker 1>What could possibly be interesting?</v>

18
00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.160
<v Speaker 1>How about your beef?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boring,</v>

19
00:00:58.161 --> 00:00:58.994
<v Speaker 1>young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What could be interesting about your </v>

20
00:01:00.141 --> 00:01:01.620
<v Speaker 1>pasta sauce?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A doubt,</v>

21
00:01:01.621 --> 00:01:04.340
<v Speaker 1>your pepper Jack Cheese fondue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and rule number three,</v>

22
00:01:04.341 --> 00:01:06.390
<v Speaker 1>and I think this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the hardest one to follow.</v>

23
00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.820
<v Speaker 1>Don't take pictures that show you </v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly having fun.</v>

24
00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:11.743
<v Speaker 1>Now I still use facebook to be sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've moved more toward instagram </v>

25
00:01:15.561 --> 00:01:18.980
<v Speaker 1>because facebook sort of became this </v>
<v Speaker 1>virtual,</v>

26
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.360
<v Speaker 1>keeping up with the Joneses where </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of getting more and more stuff,</v>

27
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.850
<v Speaker 1>it was trying to look more and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>

28
00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.310
<v Speaker 1>I think of the instagram camera as my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

29
00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.150
<v Speaker 1>I use it to share what I see so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

30
00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.700
<v Speaker 1>my friends can experience what I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiencing.</v>

31
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.980
<v Speaker 1>Do I sometimes break those rules above?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean no.</v>

32
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.320
<v Speaker 1>Never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never.</v>

33
00:01:39.321 --> 00:01:41.660
<v Speaker 1>Do I ever break those rules?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course I do,</v>

34
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.160
<v Speaker 1>but they're in my head nonetheless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have your own instagram rules,</v>

35
00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.490
<v Speaker 1>leave them in the comments below and </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't be afraid of those people who like</v>

36
00:01:49.491 --> 00:01:50.120
<v Speaker 1>to say,</v>

37
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.953
<v Speaker 2>I don't like to live by any rules and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can tell me what to do because that </v>

38
00:01:54.261 --> 00:01:58.550
<v Speaker 2>person always talks like this and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to live with that.</v>

39
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.340
<v Speaker 1>He's a nice that you live in New York </v>
<v Speaker 1>City,</v>

40
00:02:02.341 --> 00:02:03.780
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's collaborate.</v>
