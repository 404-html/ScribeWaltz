1
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.390
<v Speaker 1>One of the great overlooked pop songs of</v>
<v Speaker 1>2016 was drake's feel,</v>

2
00:00:09.391 --> 00:00:10.224
<v Speaker 1>no ways of his April release views,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think overlooked because in terms of </v>

3
00:00:13.351 --> 00:00:14.184
<v Speaker 1>radio play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the song was lost in the shadow </v>

4
00:00:15.871 --> 00:00:20.590
<v Speaker 1>of one dance and controller to dancehall</v>
<v Speaker 1>and few singles that dominated the grip.</v>

5
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.840
<v Speaker 1>Sonia from way back when you know that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't play,</v>

6
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.780
<v Speaker 1>which is a shame because I feel no ways </v>
<v Speaker 1>I think is just as good,</v>

7
00:00:27.781 --> 00:00:30.450
<v Speaker 1>if not better than those songs and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than that,</v>

8
00:00:30.451 --> 00:00:31.284
<v Speaker 1>it tells an interesting story about </v>
<v Speaker 1>Drake's place at the center of Popular </v>

9
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:35.303
<v Speaker 1>Music in 2016.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I want to spend most of my time </v>

10
00:00:37.021 --> 00:00:37.854
<v Speaker 1>discussing the production here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but lyrically we should note that feel </v>

11
00:00:40.411 --> 00:00:43.440
<v Speaker 1>no ways treads over some familiar </v>
<v Speaker 1>territory.</v>

12
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:44.483
<v Speaker 1>He's lamenting the end of a relationship</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he's had to cut short because it </v>

13
00:00:47.781 --> 00:00:49.080
<v Speaker 1>was holding him back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Personally.</v>

14
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.210
<v Speaker 1>This is drake and full emotional pop.</v>

15
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.950
<v Speaker 1>Now some people come to drake for rap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Others come to him for RNB inflicted pop</v>

16
00:00:55.951 --> 00:00:56.784
<v Speaker 1>like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most of us love him and his music </v>

17
00:00:58.561 --> 00:01:01.260
<v Speaker 1>for the bridge that he navigates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Between those two things.</v>

18
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.120
<v Speaker 1>A bridge that was really first explored </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a big way by Kanye west on his hugely</v>

19
00:01:06.121 --> 00:01:06.954
<v Speaker 1>influential album,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight weeks in Hartland gene may cause </v>

20
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.073
<v Speaker 1>within this 80 style electro r and b </v>
<v Speaker 1>that young drake found a lane for </v>

21
00:01:19.921 --> 00:01:20.754
<v Speaker 1>himself to dominate and perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A drake himself cited Kanye as an </v>

22
00:01:24.121 --> 00:01:26.940
<v Speaker 1>inspiration and drake's longtime </v>
<v Speaker 1>producer and collaborator,</v>

23
00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.510
<v Speaker 1>no afford 40 should be described as one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the early Eureka moment.</v>

24
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.373
<v Speaker 1>The experience of hearing drake rap over</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kanye say you will the first track from </v>

25
00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:35.700
<v Speaker 1>eight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>

26
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.700
<v Speaker 1>why do I feel so alone?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like everybody passes out the role.</v>

27
00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:43.493
<v Speaker 1>I tried seven years later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drake and 40 have shifted the pop focus </v>

28
00:01:47.221 --> 00:01:49.050
<v Speaker 1>into their own center of gravity.</v>

29
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.080
<v Speaker 1>This Toronto Cold Edis Electro R and B </v>
<v Speaker 1>rap pop hybrid that you hear everywhere,</v>

30
00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.650
<v Speaker 1>most notably in the musician straight </v>
<v Speaker 1>has signed his own record label.</v>

31
00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.513
<v Speaker 1>October is very unsound or ops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the producer from one of those </v>

32
00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:03.223
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary omen from Majid Jordan and</v>
<v Speaker 1>rnb duo composed feel no ways and it's </v>

33
00:02:07.701 --> 00:02:11.970
<v Speaker 1>sort of the perfect distillation of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sounds and moods that we've been talking</v>

34
00:02:11.971 --> 00:02:13.770
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't feel no ways is made up.</v>

35
00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.710
<v Speaker 1>Essentially have three parts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Greg's voice,</v>

36
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.633
<v Speaker 1>a break beat drum patterns and an </v>
<v Speaker 1>electric piano that plays a simple but </v>

37
00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.090
<v Speaker 1>catchy chord progression that goes like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

38
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.853
<v Speaker 1>c major seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>g major seven and a minor seven with a </v>

39
00:02:33.901 --> 00:02:34.734
<v Speaker 1>few little flourishes here and there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This progression pretty much loops for </v>

40
00:02:37.441 --> 00:02:38.274
<v Speaker 1>the entire song,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what's more significant than the </v>

41
00:02:40.441 --> 00:02:44.340
<v Speaker 1>courts are the sounds that omen selected</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the song.</v>

42
00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.090
<v Speaker 1>The synth being used here is the famous </v>
<v Speaker 1>Yamaha dx seven,</v>

43
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.200
<v Speaker 1>which was only made between the years of</v>
<v Speaker 1>1983 and 1989.</v>

44
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:53.423
<v Speaker 1>The dx seven is one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>commercially successful synthesizers of </v>

45
00:02:56.161 --> 00:02:56.994
<v Speaker 1>all time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It came equipped with 30 odd factory </v>

46
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.200
<v Speaker 1>meant to emulate different instruments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

47
00:03:02.201 --> 00:03:03.034
<v Speaker 1>in theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could program more sounds in </v>

48
00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:05.674
<v Speaker 1>addition to this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the interface was so notoriously </v>

49
00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:11.860
<v Speaker 1>confusing that most people stuck to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>presets and as a result,</v>

50
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:12.723
<v Speaker 1>a whole decade of music became infused </v>
<v Speaker 1>and associated with these instantly </v>

51
00:03:16.721 --> 00:03:19.570
<v Speaker 1>recognizable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sounds to the point of cliche</v>

52
00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.370
<v Speaker 1>considering how tacky the dxf and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sounded by the end of the eighties,</v>

53
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.810
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing how draken omen </v>
<v Speaker 1>reappropriate it for this driving upbeat</v>

54
00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.280
<v Speaker 1>pop song.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In 2016,</v>

55
00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:44.653
<v Speaker 1>of course it wasn't sound as fresh by </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself and that's why I think the true </v>

56
00:03:48.111 --> 00:03:51.200
<v Speaker 1>cleverness here is how omen pairs this </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>

57
00:03:51.201 --> 00:03:52.034
<v Speaker 1>DX seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>emulation of a fender Rhodes piano with </v>

58
00:03:54.411 --> 00:03:55.244
<v Speaker 1>another classic Edis Element,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a drum sample from the very origins of </v>

59
00:03:59.421 --> 00:04:00.254
<v Speaker 1>hip hop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This breakbeat comes from an absolutely </v>

60
00:04:05.131 --> 00:04:05.964
<v Speaker 1>incredible album called scratch him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is an early hip hop record from </v>

61
00:04:09.241 --> 00:04:13.860
<v Speaker 1>1983 put together by maybe the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>unlikely guy.</v>

62
00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:14.723
<v Speaker 1>Imagine that's Malcolm Mclaren,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a British impresario who helped launch </v>

63
00:04:19.501 --> 00:04:24.501
<v Speaker 1>the punk movement in the UK by founding </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sex pistols in 1975 in the eighties.</v>

64
00:04:24.541 --> 00:04:27.900
<v Speaker 1>He went solo and released an album </v>
<v Speaker 1>called duck rock under his own name,</v>

65
00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.570
<v Speaker 1>which brought together African music and</v>
<v Speaker 1>American hip hop,</v>

66
00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.040
<v Speaker 1>helping to popularize the sound and </v>
<v Speaker 1>America and exported around the world on</v>

67
00:04:35.041 --> 00:04:35.874
<v Speaker 1>duck rock and dlx scratching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mclaren collaborated with Djs from one </v>

68
00:04:38.701 --> 00:04:41.310
<v Speaker 1>of the earliest and best hip hop radio </v>
<v Speaker 1>shows.</v>

69
00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.300
<v Speaker 1>The world's famous supreme team,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which aired at 4:00</v>

70
00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.133
<v Speaker 1>AM on the east coast for an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Omen brilliantly pulled the beat from </v>

71
00:04:49.351 --> 00:04:50.184
<v Speaker 1>their song,</v>
<v Speaker 1>world's famous and put the DJ's own </v>

72
00:04:52.231 --> 00:04:53.790
<v Speaker 1>voices and the breakdown</v>

73
00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.510
<v Speaker 2>because way</v>

74
00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.050
<v Speaker 1>two main elements pulls from both sides </v>
<v Speaker 1>of drake's musical aesthetic,</v>

75
00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.923
<v Speaker 1>eighties R and B and hip hop and fuses </v>
<v Speaker 1>them under his voice which pops out of </v>

76
00:05:23.671 --> 00:05:24.504
<v Speaker 1>the instrumentation like cold water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried to sleep in the song is the </v>

77
00:05:33.391 --> 00:05:34.224
<v Speaker 1>perfect encapsulation of the pop music </v>
<v Speaker 1>that drake and his team have defined in </v>

78
00:05:37.411 --> 00:05:38.244
<v Speaker 1>the last few years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A kind of music that feeds its </v>

79
00:05:40.231 --> 00:05:43.080
<v Speaker 1>influences within the elements that make</v>
<v Speaker 1>it up.</v>

80
00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.380
<v Speaker 1>Of course eventually pop music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll move on.</v>

81
00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.350
<v Speaker 1>The style will change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone new will move to the center,</v>

82
00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:53.710
<v Speaker 1>but it's good to appreciate the moment </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're in while we're in it,</v>

83
00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:58.400
<v Speaker 1>especially in those rare times when the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most popular</v>

84
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:03.400
<v Speaker 3>artist is also one of the best.</v>
