<v Speaker 1>History,</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional anxiety,</v>

2
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.083
<v Speaker 1>anxiety about emotions and thinkers from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the classical period to the modern have </v>

3
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:31.040
<v Speaker 1>pitted emotion against reason as </v>
<v Speaker 1>opposing forces vying for the minds,</v>

4
00:00:31.321 --> 00:00:34.560
<v Speaker 1>control and emotional person was seen as</v>
<v Speaker 1>weak,</v>

5
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:35.423
<v Speaker 1>giving into the path of least resistance</v>
<v Speaker 1>to base desires ruled by capricious </v>

6
00:00:40.231 --> 00:00:42.990
<v Speaker 1>feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Q is the path to the dark side.</v>

7
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.280
<v Speaker 1>Strong on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would rule their emotions with reason.</v>

8
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.060
<v Speaker 1>Everyone feels pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Winners don't let it show.</v>

9
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.923
<v Speaker 1>Disney personified this struggle in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>short eight minute cartoon from 1943 </v>

10
00:00:55.561 --> 00:00:59.130
<v Speaker 1>called aptly reason and emotion within </v>
<v Speaker 1>each of us.</v>

11
00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.003
<v Speaker 1>These two wages ceaseless back from </v>
<v Speaker 1>mastering the short is a lightly </v>

12
00:01:02.911 --> 00:01:03.744
<v Speaker 1>disguised propaganda piece,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heartening Americans against fear </v>

13
00:01:05.911 --> 00:01:08.940
<v Speaker 1>tactics used by the axis powers in World</v>
<v Speaker 1>War II,</v>

14
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.420
<v Speaker 1>but it was nonetheless a point of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reference for the Pixar team,</v>

15
00:01:12.421 --> 00:01:16.590
<v Speaker 1>led by director Pete doctor responsible </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the film inside out.</v>

16
00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:17.583
<v Speaker 1>Doctors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Film is a far more nuanced take on the </v>

17
00:01:19.831 --> 00:01:20.664
<v Speaker 1>inner workings of the mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>appropriate for a post 40 and post </v>

18
00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:24.834
<v Speaker 1>cultural revolution age when we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>encouraged extensively at least to </v>

19
00:01:27.871 --> 00:01:31.090
<v Speaker 1>embrace emotions rather than urged to </v>
<v Speaker 1>masterman.</v>

20
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.210
<v Speaker 1>The film tells the story of the 11 year </v>
<v Speaker 1>old Riley as she navigates a move across</v>

21
00:01:36.211 --> 00:01:39.390
<v Speaker 1>the country and more centrally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how five emotions,</v>

22
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.460
<v Speaker 1>joy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the leader sadness,</v>

23
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:42.660
<v Speaker 1>fear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>disgust,</v>

24
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:43.553
<v Speaker 1>and anger balanced the control of her </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind from a mission control like </v>

25
00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.263
<v Speaker 1>headquarters in this model,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each day consists of discrete moments </v>

26
00:01:51.451 --> 00:01:52.284
<v Speaker 1>colored by one of the five emotions </v>
<v Speaker 1>which are sent during sleep to a vast </v>

27
00:01:56.131 --> 00:01:56.964
<v Speaker 1>archive of longterm memories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very rarely inexperienced is so </v>

28
00:02:00.541 --> 00:02:01.374
<v Speaker 1>formative that it creates a core memory </v>
<v Speaker 1>which goes on to form the basis of </v>

29
00:02:05.221 --> 00:02:10.050
<v Speaker 1>Riley's personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagined as themed Park Islands when joy</v>

30
00:02:10.051 --> 00:02:13.050
<v Speaker 1>and sadness are accidentally injected </v>
<v Speaker 1>from headquarters.</v>

31
00:02:13.051 --> 00:02:13.884
<v Speaker 1>The film chronicles their Cathartic </v>
<v Speaker 1>journey through several other mental </v>

32
00:02:16.561 --> 00:02:18.750
<v Speaker 1>regions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including imagination land,</v>

33
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:19.733
<v Speaker 1>a dream production company that looks </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the paramount lot abstract thought </v>

34
00:02:23.281 --> 00:02:24.114
<v Speaker 1>and a subconscious jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Catharsis comes when joy realizes </v>

35
00:02:27.541 --> 00:02:30.810
<v Speaker 1>that sadness is not only useful but </v>
<v Speaker 1>essential,</v>

36
00:02:30.811 --> 00:02:34.650
<v Speaker 1>perhaps even more essential than she is </v>
<v Speaker 1>to Riley's harmonious,</v>

37
00:02:34.651 --> 00:02:37.020
<v Speaker 1>mental functioning and overall </v>
<v Speaker 1>happiness.</v>

38
00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.680
<v Speaker 1>The film itself and its message to </v>
<v Speaker 1>embrace sadness,</v>

39
00:02:40.681 --> 00:02:41.514
<v Speaker 1>to feel what needs feeling is surely a </v>
<v Speaker 1>token of progress against our long </v>

40
00:02:45.771 --> 00:02:46.604
<v Speaker 1>standing emotional anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but is this model of the mind and its </v>

41
00:02:50.321 --> 00:02:53.640
<v Speaker 1>emotions and accurate one inside out </v>
<v Speaker 1>basis.</v>

42
00:02:53.641 --> 00:02:54.474
<v Speaker 1>It's theory of emotions in large part on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the work of Paul Ekman and influential </v>

43
00:02:58.321 --> 00:02:59.154
<v Speaker 1>scientists in the psychology of emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ekman posits that there are seven basic </v>

44
00:03:03.431 --> 00:03:04.264
<v Speaker 1>emotions with universal facial signals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ones featured in the film plus two </v>

45
00:03:08.441 --> 00:03:10.720
<v Speaker 1>that were cut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>surprise and content.</v>

46
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.100
<v Speaker 1>These basic emotions are ubiquitous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The world over Eckman says,</v>

47
00:03:15.101 --> 00:03:15.934
<v Speaker 1>and can be read on the faces of anyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether that's by an astute listener or </v>

48
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.913
<v Speaker 1>facial recognition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Software like those Ekman has helped </v>

49
00:03:22.991 --> 00:03:26.260
<v Speaker 1>develop controversially for security and</v>
<v Speaker 1>marketing uses.</v>

50
00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:27.653
<v Speaker 1>Ekman and other consultants on the film </v>
<v Speaker 1>have praised inside out for providing a </v>

51
00:03:30.911 --> 00:03:35.770
<v Speaker 1>model for kids that is engaging as well </v>
<v Speaker 1>as scientifically sound,</v>

52
00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.963
<v Speaker 1>but the edmunds model may be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominant one in the psychology of </v>

53
00:03:39.971 --> 00:03:40.540
<v Speaker 1>emotion.</v>

54
00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:41.373
<v Speaker 1>Right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's by no means the only indeed the </v>

55
00:03:43.691 --> 00:03:44.524
<v Speaker 1>field is a far more fractious one than </v>
<v Speaker 1>the film scientific consultants lead on </v>

56
00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.073
<v Speaker 1>inside out seems to suggest that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>child's experiences will be defined by </v>

57
00:03:53.141 --> 00:03:53.974
<v Speaker 1>whichever emotion is at the health.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's more that overall personality </v>

58
00:03:58.031 --> 00:04:01.960
<v Speaker 1>determined by colored core memories has </v>
<v Speaker 1>an emotional driver.</v>

59
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.880
<v Speaker 1>This model stands opposite to the key </v>
<v Speaker 1>insights of psychoanalysis,</v>

60
00:04:06.881 --> 00:04:07.714
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which hold that emotions can be </v>

61
00:04:09.461 --> 00:04:10.294
<v Speaker 1>transferred,</v>
<v Speaker 1>transformed or distorted expressions of </v>

62
00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.420
<v Speaker 1>unconscious ideas and repressed </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences.</v>

63
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:17.433
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feelings of sadness or joy or fear are </v>

64
00:04:20.711 --> 00:04:23.770
<v Speaker 1>frequently far removed from their </v>
<v Speaker 1>causes.</v>

65
00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.420
<v Speaker 1>Understanding them as specific entities </v>
<v Speaker 1>is troublesome because they're often not</v>

66
00:04:28.421 --> 00:04:29.254
<v Speaker 1>what they seem to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to say that understanding of </v>

67
00:04:30.991 --> 00:04:31.824
<v Speaker 1>motion as the driver and not the </v>
<v Speaker 1>expression of ideas and experience may </v>

68
00:04:35.321 --> 00:04:37.680
<v Speaker 1>ignore underlying causes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>

69
00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:38.523
<v Speaker 1>the idea that emotions or memories can </v>
<v Speaker 1>be separate or discrete in any way is a </v>

70
00:04:42.221 --> 00:04:43.054
<v Speaker 1>dubious one.</v>

71
00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.013
<v Speaker 1>The film itself begins to challenge this</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the end when the control panel in </v>

72
00:04:46.691 --> 00:04:47.524
<v Speaker 1>headquarters is expanded to fit all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions and when the memory orb start </v>

73
00:04:51.101 --> 00:04:51.934
<v Speaker 1>to reflect mixed experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a sense that experience can be </v>

74
00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:59.320
<v Speaker 1>quantified,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pervades the film and like anything that</v>

75
00:04:59.321 --> 00:05:00.154
<v Speaker 1>may reflect more about our culture at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the moment than the science itself for </v>

76
00:05:03.801 --> 00:05:07.100
<v Speaker 1>joy and sadness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The scariest place in the film isn't the</v>

77
00:05:07.101 --> 00:05:10.130
<v Speaker 1>subconscious prison that houses Riley's </v>
<v Speaker 1>worst fears,</v>

78
00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:11.293
<v Speaker 1>but a giant pit in the center of Riley's</v>
<v Speaker 1>mine where memories are forgotten </v>

79
00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.943
<v Speaker 1>forever without any hope of recall in an</v>
<v Speaker 1>increasingly data driven culture where </v>

80
00:05:20.811 --> 00:05:21.644
<v Speaker 1>more data equals more truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The greatest anxiety of all is the loss </v>

81
00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:29.480
<v Speaker 1>of information and the headquarters of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Riley's.</v>

82
00:05:29.481 --> 00:05:30.314
<v Speaker 1>Mine does feel a bit managerial with its</v>
<v Speaker 1>control panel and user manuals and </v>

83
00:05:34.521 --> 00:05:35.354
<v Speaker 1>Riley,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bit like an automaton controlled by a </v>

84
00:05:37.251 --> 00:05:39.830
<v Speaker 1>highly sophisticated technocratic </v>
<v Speaker 1>operation.</v>

85
00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:40.693
<v Speaker 1>The decision making process is a bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>wonky to since the latest neuroscience </v>

86
00:05:43.731 --> 00:05:48.620
<v Speaker 1>tells us that the frontal lobe and Max </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of executive function that mediates</v>

87
00:05:48.621 --> 00:05:49.454
<v Speaker 1>between the emotions and the limbic </v>
<v Speaker 1>system and higher cognitive functions </v>

88
00:05:52.591 --> 00:05:57.060
<v Speaker 1>like reflection and critical thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously not always in favor of the.</v>

89
00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:58.070
<v Speaker 1>Maybe</v>

90
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.620
<v Speaker 2>at this point you're saying the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing as the voice.</v>

91
00:06:00.621 --> 00:06:02.960
<v Speaker 2>In my own head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a kid's movie.</v>

92
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.350
<v Speaker 2>It's a comedy and that's very true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the director,</v>

93
00:06:06.351 --> 00:06:08.230
<v Speaker 2>Pete doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has never held this film up</v>

94
00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:09.163
<v Speaker 1>as an academic or therapeutic tool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He admits the need for poetic and </v>

95
00:06:12.501 --> 00:06:13.334
<v Speaker 1>comedic license to adding an executive </v>
<v Speaker 1>function like the kind of just </v>

96
00:06:16.101 --> 00:06:16.940
<v Speaker 1>mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

97
00:06:16.941 --> 00:06:19.340
<v Speaker 1>would no doubt make the film too </v>
<v Speaker 1>complex,</v>

98
00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:20.383
<v Speaker 1>as with any number of other things like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the two basic emotions he left out or </v>

99
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:27.320
<v Speaker 1>any other emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think his dramatic instincts can</v>

100
00:06:27.321 --> 00:06:28.154
<v Speaker 1>be questioned here under the premises of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the emotional model that inside out </v>

101
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:34.670
<v Speaker 1>presents the narrative unfolds with </v>
<v Speaker 1>grace,</v>

102
00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:37.130
<v Speaker 1>subtle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deep and intense poignancy.</v>

103
00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.650
<v Speaker 1>I'll leave the formal critique to </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone else,</v>

104
00:06:39.651 --> 00:06:43.360
<v Speaker 1>but there's no doubt that this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>masterful filmmaking.</v>

105
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:44.623
<v Speaker 1>I had the tiers to prove it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it does raise questions about the </v>

106
00:06:47.751 --> 00:06:48.584
<v Speaker 1>effect of popular models of the mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pixar tell stories so mythic and </v>

107
00:06:52.941 --> 00:06:53.774
<v Speaker 1>archetipal and so well that it's all but</v>
<v Speaker 1>impossible not to internalize some of </v>

108
00:06:58.461 --> 00:07:00.710
<v Speaker 1>their elements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially for kids.</v>

109
00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:05.120
<v Speaker 1>If the result is that children learn </v>
<v Speaker 1>earlier and better why it's important to</v>

110
00:07:05.121 --> 00:07:05.954
<v Speaker 1>accept and expect sadness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I think it's unquestionably a good </v>

111
00:07:10.221 --> 00:07:14.510
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sadness and joy and fear and disgust</v>

112
00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:19.540
<v Speaker 1>and anger are not discrete things or </v>
<v Speaker 1>self contained or even fully internal.</v>

113
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:25.190
<v Speaker 1>Neither are personality traits or for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that matter personalities,</v>

114
00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:30.620
<v Speaker 1>any model of emotion is going to reflect</v>
<v Speaker 1>a split between biology and culture,</v>

115
00:07:30.621 --> 00:07:34.340
<v Speaker 1>between neuroscience and theoretical </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalysis.</v>

116
00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:35.513
<v Speaker 1>Don't let anyone tell you that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>debate has been decided one way or the </v>

117
00:07:38.031 --> 00:07:38.864
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are as many emotional theories as </v>

118
00:07:40.701 --> 00:07:41.534
<v Speaker 1>there are emotional psychologists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's interesting and ironic about </v>

119
00:07:45.591 --> 00:07:48.800
<v Speaker 1>inside out is that Riley may come off as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bit robotic,</v>

120
00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:50.083
<v Speaker 1>but a more complex and complete </v>
<v Speaker 1>framework for the inner workings of the </v>

121
00:07:53.301 --> 00:07:56.510
<v Speaker 1>mind can be found.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Enjoy herself.</v>

122
00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:57.373
<v Speaker 1>A character who questions and reflects </v>
<v Speaker 1>who turns inward not to another smaller </v>

123
00:08:02.451 --> 00:08:03.284
<v Speaker 1>headquarters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a cauldron of indistinct compounds </v>

124
00:08:06.141 --> 00:08:06.974
<v Speaker 1>of feeling influenced by chemistry </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation and other people inside out </v>

125
00:08:12.171 --> 00:08:13.004
<v Speaker 1>may not be perfectly accurate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the film inspires something more </v>

126
00:08:17.031 --> 00:08:17.864
<v Speaker 1>important than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something that doesn't require </v>

127
00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:25.120
<v Speaker 1>scientific exactness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional intelligence.</v>

128
00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:33.500
<v Speaker 2>It is a sunny day outside right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey everybody,</v>

129
00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:35.310
<v Speaker 2>thanks for watching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

130
00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:36.353
<v Speaker 2>I love Pixar generally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I love this movie just because it </v>

131
00:08:38.271 --> 00:08:39.104
<v Speaker 2>gives you so much to dig into an </v>
<v Speaker 2>explorer and I had a lot of fun making </v>

132
00:08:41.511 --> 00:08:42.970
<v Speaker 2>this and putting this together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

133
00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:43.903
<v Speaker 2>if you think that the nerd writer and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what I'm doing here is something that </v>

134
00:08:46.911 --> 00:08:47.744
<v Speaker 2>you're not seeing elsewhere on youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can pledge little to my channel by </v>

135
00:08:51.021 --> 00:08:51.854
<v Speaker 2>clicking here and going to my patriots </v>
<v Speaker 2>what funds this project and helps me </v>

136
00:08:56.521 --> 00:08:58.890
<v Speaker 2>improve the quality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so much more I want to do.</v>

137
00:08:58.891 --> 00:09:00.810
<v Speaker 2>There's more series that I'm going to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>introducing soon.</v>

138
00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.380
<v Speaker 2>And the funding is what makes it </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>

139
00:09:04.381 --> 00:09:05.214
<v Speaker 2>I mean that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the unique relationship between </v>

140
00:09:06.211 --> 00:09:07.044
<v Speaker 2>you and me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing in between us and what </v>

141
00:09:08.581 --> 00:09:09.414
<v Speaker 2>you give me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The money you give me helps me to make </v>

142
00:09:11.191 --> 00:09:15.960
<v Speaker 2>this project better and more in depth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I hope that you trust that I will do</v>

143
00:09:15.961 --> 00:09:16.794
<v Speaker 2>that by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the quality of the content that I've </v>

144
00:09:18.631 --> 00:09:19.464
<v Speaker 2>made so far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So thank you so much again for watching </v>
