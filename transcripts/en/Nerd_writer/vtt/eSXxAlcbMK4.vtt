1
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.440
<v Speaker 1>The year was 1997.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bill Clinton was sworn in for the second</v>

2
00:00:31.441 --> 00:00:32.274
<v Speaker 1>time as US president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the United Kingdom transferred the </v>

3
00:00:34.771 --> 00:00:38.970
<v Speaker 1>sovereignty of Hong Kong to China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>effectively ending the British empire.</v>

4
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.170
<v Speaker 1>Scientists cloned a sheep at the Roslyn </v>
<v Speaker 1>institute in Scotland,</v>

5
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.440
<v Speaker 1>and Catherine Hettinger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an inventor from Tulsa,</v>

6
00:00:46.441 --> 00:00:50.010
<v Speaker 1>Oklahoma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>filed a patent in Washington dc for what</v>

7
00:00:50.011 --> 00:00:52.050
<v Speaker 1>was then called the spinning toy,</v>

8
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:00.323
<v Speaker 1>what the world knows now as the fidget </v>
<v Speaker 1>spinner was an invention born out of </v>

9
00:01:04.081 --> 00:01:06.540
<v Speaker 1>paint in the early nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>living in Florida,</v>

10
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.670
<v Speaker 1>passenger was suffering from my </v>
<v Speaker 1>Asthenia,</v>

11
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.290
<v Speaker 1>gravis and neuromuscular disease that </v>
<v Speaker 1>causes weakness in the skeletal muscles.</v>

12
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.320
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't pick up her toys or play with</v>
<v Speaker 1>them at all.</v>

13
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.510
<v Speaker 1>Hettinger says of her then young </v>
<v Speaker 1>daughter,</v>

14
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:19.733
<v Speaker 1>so I started throwing things together </v>
<v Speaker 1>with newspaper and tape than other </v>

15
00:01:22.891 --> 00:01:25.500
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't really even prototyping.</v>

16
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:26.663
<v Speaker 1>It was some semblance of something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't long until that semblance </v>

17
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.853
<v Speaker 1>began to take shape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pittenger flew with her daughter to our </v>

18
00:01:33.931 --> 00:01:34.764
<v Speaker 1>nation's capital to patent her new </v>
<v Speaker 1>invention with the anticipation perhaps </v>

19
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:40.500
<v Speaker 1>of a gold rush</v>

20
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:44.753
<v Speaker 2>shopping for the next furby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the goal at the sixth annual </v>

21
00:01:47.851 --> 00:01:51.300
<v Speaker 2>toy and decoration affair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At the Metro Toronto Convention Center,</v>

22
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.690
<v Speaker 2>our own young at heart reporter Brian </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hatchell stuff by</v>

23
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:55.753
<v Speaker 1>say hello to crazy bones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These small plastic figurines come and </v>

24
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.540
<v Speaker 1>dozens of shapes and sizes and cost </v>
<v Speaker 1>about a buck each.</v>

25
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.260
<v Speaker 1>The 19 nineties were of course no </v>
<v Speaker 1>stranger to toy crisis,</v>

26
00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.150
<v Speaker 1>whether it was crazy bones or pugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>furbies or Tamagotchi.</v>

27
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.710
<v Speaker 1>Every year the world was once again </v>
<v Speaker 1>possessed with a new favorite toy.</v>

28
00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.780
<v Speaker 1>No one could guess what was going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>next.</v>

29
00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.420
<v Speaker 1>Toy makers would have paid handsomely to</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody who could,</v>

30
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:21.583
<v Speaker 1>but each time the new craze seemed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sink pointedly with the national </v>

31
00:02:25.551 --> 00:02:26.200
<v Speaker 1>character.</v>

32
00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.830
<v Speaker 3>What is Jack?</v>

33
00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.850
<v Speaker 1>I think there's anything tremendously </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophic about it.</v>

34
00:02:36.851 --> 00:02:38.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's any metaphysical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think it's</v>

35
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:39.713
<v Speaker 3>which one to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Suck it up and scrub it up with a guy </v>

36
00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.410
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pop it up and pull it up later.</v>

37
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.910
<v Speaker 1>If Catherine hettinger returned from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington DC with magnificent images of</v>

38
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:54.803
<v Speaker 1>GAC swirling around in her head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who could blame her and for awhile it </v>

39
00:02:58.771 --> 00:02:59.604
<v Speaker 1>looked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those gaps soak dreams would become a </v>

40
00:03:01.121 --> 00:03:03.280
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The mammoth toy company,</v>

41
00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.370
<v Speaker 1>Hasbro agreed to test headend jurors </v>
<v Speaker 1>finger spinners.</v>

42
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.983
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the end they decided not to move </v>

43
00:03:10.721 --> 00:03:11.554
<v Speaker 1>forward with the production and some </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that should not have been </v>

44
00:03:16.841 --> 00:03:21.130
<v Speaker 1>forgotten or lost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>History became legend.</v>

45
00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:22.623
<v Speaker 1>Legend became myth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and for two decades the spinning toy </v>

46
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.390
<v Speaker 1>passed out of all knowledge until when </v>
<v Speaker 1>chance came,</v>

47
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.180
<v Speaker 1>it ensnared a new generation.</v>

48
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:38.373
<v Speaker 4>They are popping up more and more in </v>
<v Speaker 4>schools and stores are really having a </v>

49
00:03:41.861 --> 00:03:42.694
<v Speaker 4>hard time keeping them on the shelves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm talking about fidget spinners or </v>

50
00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.670
<v Speaker 4>fidget spinners.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll call them fidget spinners,</v>

51
00:03:48.671 --> 00:03:50.560
<v Speaker 4>fidget widgets or whatever you'd like.</v>

52
00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:51.730
<v Speaker 1>Fidget,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spinner,</v>

53
00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.240
<v Speaker 1>fidget spinners is caught a fidget </v>
<v Speaker 1>spinner.</v>

54
00:03:54.241 --> 00:03:55.074
<v Speaker 1>My daughter has one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just kind of put on your finger and </v>

55
00:03:56.011 --> 00:03:56.844
<v Speaker 1>spin it around like this though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one can say when exactly the fidget </v>

56
00:04:00.301 --> 00:04:05.010
<v Speaker 1>spinner came to America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In late 2016 reality TV star,</v>

57
00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.670
<v Speaker 1>Donald trump had been elected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The 45th president of the United States.</v>

58
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
<v Speaker 1>All cell phones had lost physical </v>
<v Speaker 1>buttons in favor of touchscreens and two</v>

59
00:04:14.251 --> 00:04:15.084
<v Speaker 1>brothers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mark and Matthew Mclaughlin had just </v>

60
00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:23.360
<v Speaker 1>unexpectedly raised $6,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a trinket called the fidget cube,</v>

61
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.420
<v Speaker 1>which a great story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a human story.</v>

62
00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:32.130
<v Speaker 1>It's a story of those who went first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were first.</v>

63
00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:37.020
<v Speaker 1>They led the way they opened the trail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's obvious to everyone that the fidget</v>

64
00:04:37.021 --> 00:04:39.990
<v Speaker 1>cube is fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean just look at it,</v>

65
00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:41.003
<v Speaker 1>but it was much more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Citing a study from the Australian </v>

66
00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:44.993
<v Speaker 1>Journal of learning difficulties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A claim was made that these game </v>

67
00:04:46.951 --> 00:04:51.951
<v Speaker 1>changing toys could actually help those </v>
<v Speaker 1>afflicted with Adhd to focus better,</v>

68
00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:53.213
<v Speaker 1>engaging in fine motor activity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The study said may assist students with </v>

69
00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:57.773
<v Speaker 1>Adhd in resisting the pool of </v>
<v Speaker 1>distraction and then two days before </v>

70
00:05:01.951 --> 00:05:05.730
<v Speaker 1>Christmas fidget spinners dormant for </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost two decades,</v>

71
00:05:05.731 --> 00:05:06.564
<v Speaker 1>except in certain underground fidget </v>
<v Speaker 1>circles exploded like lightening onto </v>

72
00:05:10.831 --> 00:05:11.664
<v Speaker 1>the scene.</v>

73
00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.680
<v Speaker 1>It's more exciting than than this makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>it seem these days</v>

74
00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:28.543
<v Speaker 5>fidget spinners are everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're in office cubicles and </v>

75
00:05:31.281 --> 00:05:34.070
<v Speaker 5>playgrounds in hospitals and locker </v>
<v Speaker 5>rooms.</v>

76
00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:35.293
<v Speaker 5>Even in the White House,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everything must be perfectly done and </v>

77
00:05:38.481 --> 00:05:39.314
<v Speaker 5>they weren't working in a production </v>
<v Speaker 5>line and you have to get so many pieces </v>

78
00:05:41.631 --> 00:05:42.464
<v Speaker 5>done per hour,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it all had to be perfectly done and </v>

79
00:05:45.321 --> 00:05:50.321
<v Speaker 5>it does extend to you as you look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the sense of serenity</v>

80
00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:51.723
<v Speaker 1>for months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The spinner is medical benefits were </v>

81
00:05:53.111 --> 00:05:56.080
<v Speaker 1>hotly contested by news websites with </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing better to do.</v>

82
00:05:56.081 --> 00:05:59.210
<v Speaker 1>Apparently they were banned from </v>
<v Speaker 1>classrooms across the globe.</v>

83
00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:02.480
<v Speaker 1>You could find them everywhere and </v>
<v Speaker 1>nowhere.</v>

84
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.033
<v Speaker 1>And what about Catherine Hettinger?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That of course is the great tragedy of </v>

85
00:06:07.341 --> 00:06:11.960
<v Speaker 1>this story in 2005 and the long dark </v>
<v Speaker 1>calm before the fidget store,</v>

86
00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:13.243
<v Speaker 1>Hettinger was forced to let her patent </v>
<v Speaker 1>expire because she couldn't afford $400 </v>

87
00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.090
<v Speaker 1>renewal fee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since then,</v>

88
00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:20.953
<v Speaker 1>the inventor of the fidget spinner </v>
<v Speaker 1>hasn't seen a dime of the prophets of </v>

89
00:06:25.341 --> 00:06:28.100
<v Speaker 1>the most successful product of all time.</v>

90
00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:29.913
<v Speaker 6>Anything really new in thought and </v>
<v Speaker 6>material life has to have its source in </v>

91
00:06:35.231 --> 00:06:40.231
<v Speaker 6>something you have to go spiritual.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Nobody can be really creative and unless</v>

92
00:06:41.231 --> 00:06:43.180
<v Speaker 6>there's something spiritual behind it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whether you,</v>

93
00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:47.470
<v Speaker 6>whether it's goes by that name or not,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean who invented the house,</v>

94
00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:52.560
<v Speaker 6>who invented any of the things?</v>
<v Speaker 6>We have probably someone engaged in some</v>

95
00:06:52.691 --> 00:06:53.524
<v Speaker 6>kind of search.</v>
