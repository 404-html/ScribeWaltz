<v Speaker 1>Here he is being told at one thimble </v>
<v Speaker 1>full of a neutron star would weigh over </v>

00:00:43.431 --> 00:00:45.470
<v Speaker 1>$100,</v>

<v Speaker 1>entanglement and understanding the key </v>
<v Speaker 1>to help plants collect,</v>

15
00:00:54.291 --> 00:00:57.860
<v Speaker 1>store and use energy from the sun at 100</v>
<v Speaker 1>percent.</v>

16
00:00:57.861 --> 00:00:58.694
<v Speaker 1>Efficiency here are super efficient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Photo voltaic solar cells that his </v>

17
00:01:02.301 --> 00:01:05.000
<v Speaker 1>physics helped to create.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here they are powering the city.</v>

<v Speaker 1>about how everything he's done,</v>

22
00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:16.783
<v Speaker 1>everything he is he owes to that first </v>
<v Speaker 1>science teacher who told him about the </v>

23
00:01:19.911 --> 00:01:20.744
<v Speaker 1>earth and how it goes around the sun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the boy who is now an old man </v>

24
00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.900
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't be wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's forgetting something,</v>

25
00:01:26.901 --> 00:01:27.734
<v Speaker 1>something he would never think of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something that predicated the Nobel </v>

26
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.280
<v Speaker 1>prize in the solar cells and the physics</v>
<v Speaker 1>and mit and his excitement that day,</v>

27
00:01:34.281 --> 00:01:37.100
<v Speaker 1>all those years ago about a thimble full</v>
<v Speaker 1>of neutron star.</v>

<v Speaker 1>some,</v>

36
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.993
<v Speaker 1>but once you reach the peak and become </v>
<v Speaker 1>self perpetuating and fun and </v>

37
00:02:07.131 --> 00:02:10.370
<v Speaker 1>transformative on and on for the rest of</v>

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.860
<v Speaker 1>Here is how much you have to donate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here are what the desks look like.</v>
