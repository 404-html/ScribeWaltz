1
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:04.260
<v Speaker 1>I think I can sum up the show for you </v>
<v Speaker 1>with one word,</v>

2
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.810
<v Speaker 1>nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

3
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:12.563
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't until episode three of season </v>

4
00:00:16.681 --> 00:00:17.514
<v Speaker 1>four that Seinfeld gave itself that </v>
<v Speaker 1>famous description as a show about </v>

5
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.100
<v Speaker 1>nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not until this episode called the pitch,</v>

6
00:00:26.101 --> 00:00:26.934
<v Speaker 1>which mock documents Jerry and Larry </v>
<v Speaker 1>David's first meeting with NBC </v>

7
00:00:31.081 --> 00:00:33.500
<v Speaker 1>executives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing happens on the shelf,</v>

8
00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.960
<v Speaker 1>just like life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The interview since then like this,</v>

9
00:00:36.961 --> 00:00:37.794
<v Speaker 1>Reddit Ama from 2014,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the creators admit that the moniker was </v>

10
00:00:40.771 --> 00:00:44.850
<v Speaker 1>only really a joke and that they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually surprised by how much it caught</v>

11
00:00:44.851 --> 00:00:45.684
<v Speaker 1>on with audiences and yet I think the </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing in question is a good lens to </v>

12
00:00:50.971 --> 00:00:51.804
<v Speaker 1>examine this show through to explore </v>
<v Speaker 1>what makes it different from other </v>

13
00:00:55.261 --> 00:01:00.090
<v Speaker 1>sitcoms and so popular still today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you think of Seinfeld,</v>

14
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.983
<v Speaker 1>the first thing that pops into your head</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably isn't 19th century French </v>

15
00:01:04.621 --> 00:01:05.454
<v Speaker 1>novelist gustave flow bear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a connection here that I </v>

16
00:01:09.121 --> 00:01:11.310
<v Speaker 1>think is worth exploring a little bit.</v>

17
00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.410
<v Speaker 1>So you bear was a pioneer of literary </v>
<v Speaker 1>realism in large part,</v>

18
00:01:16.411 --> 00:01:17.244
<v Speaker 1>responsible for raising the status of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the novel to that have a high art so </v>

19
00:01:22.081 --> 00:01:22.914
<v Speaker 1>intense with his dedication to craft </v>
<v Speaker 1>that in a letter to Luis call a in </v>

20
00:01:26.491 --> 00:01:28.440
<v Speaker 1>January 18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>52,</v>

21
00:01:28.441 --> 00:01:29.274
<v Speaker 1>he wrote what seems beautiful to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I should like to write is a book </v>

22
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.033
<v Speaker 1>about nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a book dependent on nothing external </v>

23
00:01:38.491 --> 00:01:42.150
<v Speaker 1>held together by the internal strength </v>
<v Speaker 1>of its style.</v>

24
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.170
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

25
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.100
<v Speaker 1>a novel like Madame bovary isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>literally about nothing.</v>

26
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.160
<v Speaker 1>The book explores themes of freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>love,</v>

27
00:01:50.161 --> 00:01:54.230
<v Speaker 1>and Human Stupidity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and explores them deeply the differences</v>

28
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.073
<v Speaker 1>that flow bear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead of getting at these themes </v>

29
00:01:56.911 --> 00:02:01.911
<v Speaker 1>through subject and plot like his </v>
<v Speaker 1>predecessors treats them with style.</v>

30
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.060
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't just want to string you along</v>
<v Speaker 1>with multiple suspense,</v>

31
00:02:06.061 --> 00:02:06.894
<v Speaker 1>heightening narrative developments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wants to bring you into the text </v>

32
00:02:10.711 --> 00:02:15.570
<v Speaker 1>itself to look there for the carefully </v>
<v Speaker 1>constructed meanings that he's built for</v>

33
00:02:15.571 --> 00:02:16.110
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

34
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.590
<v Speaker 1>So in full bear says he wants to write a</v>
<v Speaker 1>book about nothing.</v>

35
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.873
<v Speaker 1>What he really means is nothing like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>established forms and genres against </v>

36
00:02:26.161 --> 00:02:28.920
<v Speaker 1>which he situated himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>

37
00:02:28.921 --> 00:02:33.000
<v Speaker 1>in any art form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the positive value of a work in question</v>

38
00:02:33.001 --> 00:02:33.834
<v Speaker 1>has to be determined against or in </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative relation to the other kinds of </v>

39
00:02:37.711 --> 00:02:38.544
<v Speaker 1>work already present in the form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the 19 fifties and number of </v>

40
00:02:41.581 --> 00:02:45.210
<v Speaker 1>conventions for the television Sitcom </v>
<v Speaker 1>had already been established.</v>

41
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.560
<v Speaker 1>Family had become the dominant setting </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the situation comedy.</v>

42
00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.580
<v Speaker 1>These sitcoms feature predominantly </v>
<v Speaker 1>white middle class families,</v>

43
00:02:52.581 --> 00:02:53.414
<v Speaker 1>sometimes with kids sometimes without </v>
<v Speaker 1>dealing comedically with a problem of </v>

44
00:02:57.121 --> 00:02:57.954
<v Speaker 1>the week before resolving the issue and </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming together into a kind of unity so </v>

45
00:03:01.661 --> 00:03:03.730
<v Speaker 1>that they could do the same thing again </v>
<v Speaker 1>next week.</v>

46
00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.930
<v Speaker 2>We sure are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>

47
00:03:08.931 --> 00:03:09.764
<v Speaker 2>Sugar.</v>

48
00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.890
<v Speaker 1>What time of the Mary Tyler Moore Show?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the 19 seventies,</v>

49
00:03:12.891 --> 00:03:16.490
<v Speaker 1>the nuclear family had been partly </v>
<v Speaker 1>supplanted by the family,</v>

50
00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.050
<v Speaker 1>but the sentimental unity of the group </v>
<v Speaker 1>was an even stronger value.</v>

51
00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.230
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for being my with cheers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the eighties,</v>

52
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.920
<v Speaker 1>Sitcom began to break from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's by then state conventions.</v>

53
00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.873
<v Speaker 1>There was less sentimentality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>less less than learning and the </v>

54
00:03:30.831 --> 00:03:31.664
<v Speaker 1>transition from family as family or </v>
<v Speaker 1>family as coworkers to family as </v>

55
00:03:35.271 --> 00:03:36.104
<v Speaker 1>friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet still there was a drive toward </v>

56
00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.340
<v Speaker 1>unity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>namely and cheers.</v>

57
00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.980
<v Speaker 1>The Romantic unity between Sam and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Diane,</v>

58
00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.980
<v Speaker 1>which gave the show a familiar dramatic </v>
<v Speaker 1>weight.</v>

59
00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.610
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

60
00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:47.443
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got it.</v>

61
00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:48.803
<v Speaker 3>You run an antique store and people come</v>
<v Speaker 3>into the store and you get involved in </v>

62
00:03:54.451 --> 00:03:55.284
<v Speaker 3>their lives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What person who runs an antique store </v>

63
00:03:57.991 --> 00:03:58.824
<v Speaker 3>gets involved in people's lives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so someone comes in to buy an old lamp </v>

64
00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.190
<v Speaker 3>and suddenly I'm getting them out of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>jam.</v>

65
00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.013
<v Speaker 3>Wasn't until</v>

66
00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:12.380
<v Speaker 1>I felt that the conventions of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sitcom work deconstructed fully when all</v>

67
00:04:12.631 --> 00:04:16.170
<v Speaker 1>forms of unity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>familial and especially romantic,</v>

68
00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.560
<v Speaker 1>were whole heartedly abandoned for </v>
<v Speaker 1>Seinfeld.</v>

69
00:04:19.561 --> 00:04:22.650
<v Speaker 1>These additional elements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're just so much fluff.</v>

70
00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:23.643
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>forget the store.</v>

71
00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.750
<v Speaker 3>They to have a story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>

72
00:04:25.751 --> 00:04:26.584
<v Speaker 3>you got to have a store</v>

73
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.080
<v Speaker 1>like flow bears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>novels.</v>

74
00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.620
<v Speaker 1>Seinfeld for goes the traditional </v>
<v Speaker 1>subject matter of the Sitcom.</v>

75
00:04:31.621 --> 00:04:32.454
<v Speaker 1>It's didactic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sentimentality centered around a family </v>

76
00:04:35.191 --> 00:04:36.024
<v Speaker 1>of one kind or another in favor of </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories held together by the internal </v>

77
00:04:40.171 --> 00:04:42.630
<v Speaker 1>strength of its comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

78
00:04:42.631 --> 00:04:45.030
<v Speaker 1>this isn't to say that Seinfeld doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have plots.</v>

79
00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.630
<v Speaker 1>It he seinfeld plots are among the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated of the genre,</v>

80
00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.380
<v Speaker 1>but the plot drivers are different from </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's predecessors.</v>

81
00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:57.030
<v Speaker 1>Instead of goal oriented principle </v>
<v Speaker 1>characters achieving their ends based on</v>

82
00:04:57.031 --> 00:05:00.690
<v Speaker 1>actions that they take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seinfeld frequently has its characters.</v>

83
00:05:00.691 --> 00:05:03.760
<v Speaker 1>Make some small action on a whim at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>start of it</v>

84
00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.110
<v Speaker 4>episode,</v>
<v Speaker 4>certain cast member of melrose place.</v>

85
00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:11.830
<v Speaker 4>Really have you ever seen the show know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then spend the rest of the half hour.</v>

86
00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:15.840
<v Speaker 1>We're dealing with the unintended </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences of that action.</v>

87
00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:16.920
<v Speaker 1>Kimberly's steel Joe's,</v>

88
00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.190
<v Speaker 3>and if they do set out to achieve</v>

89
00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.790
<v Speaker 1>a goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if they get turned on,</v>

90
00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.500
<v Speaker 1>they often fail in the end because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstances beyond their means.</v>

91
00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.933
<v Speaker 4>Can I be expected to have the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>expertise as people who own this </v>

92
00:05:32.081 --> 00:05:34.090
<v Speaker 4>equipment in Seinfeld?</v>

93
00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:35.003
<v Speaker 1>More complicated narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Small events from one character's life </v>

94
00:05:37.861 --> 00:05:38.694
<v Speaker 1>can determine outcomes in another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any action that any character takes has </v>

95
00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.330
<v Speaker 1>unexpected consequences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that coincidence,</v>

96
00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:46.223
<v Speaker 1>merely a device in traditional goal </v>
<v Speaker 1>oriented sitcoms becomes the rule on </v>

97
00:05:50.941 --> 00:05:53.670
<v Speaker 1>Seinfeld.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the guy officer</v>

98
00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:56.590
<v Speaker 3>Larry.</v>

99
00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:57.423
<v Speaker 1>David's no hugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no learning policy for Seinfeld is in </v>

100
00:06:01.281 --> 00:06:02.114
<v Speaker 1>keeping with the show based on refusals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>refusal to entertain sentimental </v>

101
00:06:06.171 --> 00:06:07.280
<v Speaker 1>endings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>real Rome,</v>

102
00:06:07.281 --> 00:06:11.000
<v Speaker 1>hence of any kind or the redemptive </v>
<v Speaker 1>power of the family.</v>

103
00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:15.020
<v Speaker 1>And in doing so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>David and Seinfeld rejected the silently</v>

104
00:06:15.021 --> 00:06:15.854
<v Speaker 1>agreed upon moral standards that guided </v>
<v Speaker 1>every other sitcom to it's weekly </v>

105
00:06:20.031 --> 00:06:21.830
<v Speaker 1>resolutions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

106
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:25.400
<v Speaker 1>like madame bovary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seinfeld isn't literally about nothing,</v>

107
00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.090
<v Speaker 1>but instead of reinforcing larger moral </v>
<v Speaker 1>standards,</v>

108
00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:33.230
<v Speaker 1>it explored insanely minute social </v>
<v Speaker 1>norms.</v>

109
00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.800
<v Speaker 1>The women know about shrinkage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean like laundry?</v>

110
00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:39.110
<v Speaker 1>Interestingly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hilariously,</v>

111
00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:40.003
<v Speaker 1>it turns out that while the morals of </v>
<v Speaker 1>past decades have shifted and changed </v>

112
00:06:43.431 --> 00:06:44.264
<v Speaker 1>under our feet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these petty behavioral questions about </v>

113
00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:49.273
<v Speaker 1>nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that important proved to be more </v>

114
00:06:51.951 --> 00:06:56.951
<v Speaker 1>timeless and timelessly funny than just </v>
<v Speaker 1>about everything else.</v>

115
00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:10.440
<v Speaker 1>Hey everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thanks for watching.</v>

116
00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:11.303
<v Speaker 1>Obviously I'm a huge Seinfeld fan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so getting to watch a lot of seinfeld </v>

117
00:07:14.461 --> 00:07:15.294
<v Speaker 1>episodes to make this video was a blast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm also getting to read a lot of flow </v>

118
