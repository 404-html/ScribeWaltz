1
00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.023
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2
00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:02.830
<v Speaker 2>Yay.</v>

3
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:05.123
<v Speaker 1>Coffee on a Tuesday in block 15.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hello to everybody who is new speaking </v>

4
00:00:19.601 --> 00:00:22.090
<v Speaker 1>for the 500 who were here before and </v>
<v Speaker 1>myself.</v>

5
00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.250
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to or generosity during the </v>
<v Speaker 1>project for awesome.</v>

6
00:00:24.251 --> 00:00:27.160
<v Speaker 1>Expanded my conception of what could be </v>
<v Speaker 1>done in this community.</v>

7
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.320
<v Speaker 1>And though it's not enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly I can only say thank you.</v>

8
00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:34.443
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>window.</v>

9
00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:39.303
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

10
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.433
<v Speaker 4>so now that that's done,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the president wanted to say </v>

11
00:00:47.031 --> 00:00:47.864
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My fellow Americans major combat </v>

12
00:00:50.781 --> 00:00:52.130
<v Speaker 4>operations in Iraq.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wait,</v>

13
00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.471
<v Speaker 4>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wait,</v>

14
00:00:52.471 --> 00:00:52.600
<v Speaker 4>wait.</v>

15
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.433
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

16
00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:54.393
<v Speaker 1>not that bright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as your commander in chief on behalf </v>

17
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.980
<v Speaker 1>of a grateful nation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm proud to finally say these two words</v>

18
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.170
<v Speaker 1>and I know your family's agree.</v>

19
00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:09.530
<v Speaker 1>Welcome home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

20
00:01:09.531 --> 00:01:10.031
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

21
00:01:10.031 --> 00:01:12.680
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Warner rack is over December 15th,</v>

22
00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.640
<v Speaker 1>2011,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight years and 270 days later,</v>

23
00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.980
<v Speaker 1>but he's early as 2004.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the worse thing about a smart to</v>

24
00:01:18.981 --> 00:01:21.260
<v Speaker 1>most as deliberately putting your hand </v>
<v Speaker 1>on a sizzling pam,</v>

25
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.290
<v Speaker 1>we have to be careful about simplifying </v>
<v Speaker 1>a complex decade because it will be left</v>

26
00:01:24.291 --> 00:01:25.124
<v Speaker 1>to us nine years later to appraise this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell a story in a way which is loyal to </v>

27
00:01:28.581 --> 00:01:30.770
<v Speaker 1>the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also answerable to the 4,000,</v>

28
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:31.753
<v Speaker 1>487 troops who gave their lives to it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the many more thousands who gave </v>

29
00:01:35.091 --> 00:01:37.520
<v Speaker 1>their arms or their legs or their </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to use either,</v>

30
00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.050
<v Speaker 1>but that I am not going to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the war proper.</v>

31
00:01:39.051 --> 00:01:39.884
<v Speaker 1>What I want to talk about is what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens when you burn your fingers on a </v>

32
00:01:42.081 --> 00:01:43.460
<v Speaker 1>sizzling pan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's happened to you,</v>

33
00:01:43.461 --> 00:01:47.210
<v Speaker 1>then you know that if it's a good solid </v>
<v Speaker 1>burn that some of your skin is gonna.</v>

34
00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:48.043
<v Speaker 1>Stay on that path and his troops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Levi records a bit of our collective </v>

35
00:01:49.881 --> 00:01:53.270
<v Speaker 1>skin which will stay in that country for</v>
<v Speaker 1>some time or roughly 16,000</v>

36
00:01:53.271 --> 00:01:54.104
<v Speaker 1>Americans still in Iraq to aid with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ongoing diplomatic effort there and </v>

37
00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:57.583
<v Speaker 1>effort which is primarily aimed at </v>
<v Speaker 1>making sure we secure and alliance with </v>

38
00:02:00.051 --> 00:02:00.884
<v Speaker 1>the young democratic government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We worked so hard and spent so much to </v>

39
00:02:03.381 --> 00:02:04.214
<v Speaker 1>put in place is particularly important </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it sits on the largest oil </v>

40
00:02:07.071 --> 00:02:07.904
<v Speaker 1>reserves in the world according to new </v>
<v Speaker 1>seismic data and with so much </v>

41
00:02:10.431 --> 00:02:12.410
<v Speaker 1>uncertainty in the region because of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arab spring.</v>

42
00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.640
<v Speaker 1>Iraq remains a very strategic allies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the $16,000</v>

43
00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.180
<v Speaker 1>split up like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>2,000</v>

44
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.940
<v Speaker 1>diplomats and 14,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>civilian contractors are.</v>

45
00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.680
<v Speaker 1>Those contractors are there for general </v>
<v Speaker 1>light support.</v>

46
00:02:21.681 --> 00:02:22.514
<v Speaker 1>Everything from transportation to food </v>
<v Speaker 1>service at mess hall and the other half </v>

47
00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.100
<v Speaker 1>are security contractors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk about the ladder security</v>

48
00:02:28.101 --> 00:02:30.380
<v Speaker 1>contractors because you hear that term </v>
<v Speaker 1>tossed around a lot,</v>

49
00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.690
<v Speaker 1>but I think a lot of people don't really</v>
<v Speaker 1>know what it means.</v>

50
00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:33.663
<v Speaker 1>I did the official name for the entity </v>
<v Speaker 1>is private military company or PMC </v>

51
00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.410
<v Speaker 1>though many know them as security </v>
<v Speaker 1>contractors or even mercenary,</v>

52
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.900
<v Speaker 1>so they don't really like that last.</v>

53
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.950
<v Speaker 3>Maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe you</v>

54
00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.270
<v Speaker 1>can see what whatever you want to call </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

55
00:02:52.271 --> 00:02:55.900
<v Speaker 1>They are corporations that deal in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>peripheral duties of war for profit.</v>

56
00:02:55.901 --> 00:02:56.734
<v Speaker 1>They can't engage in offensive </v>
<v Speaker 1>operations according to the Geneva </v>

57
00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:59.763
<v Speaker 1>Convention that they can do almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything but including defensive </v>

58
00:03:02.231 --> 00:03:04.600
<v Speaker 1>operations with a liberal use of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>term defense.</v>

59
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.040
<v Speaker 1>They build planes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maintain them,</v>

60
00:03:06.041 --> 00:03:06.874
<v Speaker 1>even fly them in conflict zones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They supply bodyguards for diplomatic </v>

61
00:03:08.811 --> 00:03:10.210
<v Speaker 1>construct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bass military camps,</v>

62
00:03:10.211 --> 00:03:12.640
<v Speaker 1>operate intelligence systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>supply weapons and ammunition,</v>

63
00:03:12.641 --> 00:03:14.260
<v Speaker 1>and they trained soldiers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

64
00:03:14.261 --> 00:03:16.600
<v Speaker 1>most security contractors are retired </v>
<v Speaker 1>soldiers,</v>

65
00:03:16.601 --> 00:03:17.434
<v Speaker 1>men and women who come out of combat </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a set of skills applicable nowhere </v>

66
00:03:20.081 --> 00:03:20.914
<v Speaker 1>else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but income that contract companies will </v>

67
00:03:22.151 --> 00:03:22.984
<v Speaker 1>pay them generously for those skills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>often more than double what the army </v>

68
00:03:24.971 --> 00:03:25.804
<v Speaker 1>pay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's no skin off their back because the </v>

69
00:03:26.441 --> 00:03:29.770
<v Speaker 1>private military industry has boomed in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the last 10 years,</v>

70
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.620
<v Speaker 1>really ever since 1991.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the Pentagon led,</v>

71
00:03:32.621 --> 00:03:33.454
<v Speaker 1>by then defense secretary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dick Cheney paid a company called Brown </v>

72
00:03:35.801 --> 00:03:38.050
<v Speaker 1>and Root Services eight point </v>
<v Speaker 1>$5,000,000,000</v>

73
00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:41.830
<v Speaker 1>to study the use of private military </v>
<v Speaker 1>forces with soldiers in combat zone.</v>

74
00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.290
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brandon and services was a subsidiary of</v>

75
00:03:44.291 --> 00:03:45.124
<v Speaker 1>Halliburton oil company where Cheney </v>
<v Speaker 1>served as ceo between his time as </v>

76
00:03:48.461 --> 00:03:49.294
<v Speaker 1>defense secretary and vice president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's studied film that outsourcing </v>

77
00:03:51.701 --> 00:03:54.040
<v Speaker 1>duties to private military companies was</v>
<v Speaker 1>cheap,</v>

78
00:03:54.041 --> 00:03:54.874
<v Speaker 1>so after nine slash 11 when the Bush </v>
<v Speaker 1>administration announced its war on </v>

79
00:03:57.011 --> 00:03:57.844
<v Speaker 1>terror,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the role of pmcs was increased </v>

80
00:03:59.291 --> 00:04:01.000
<v Speaker 1>dramatically during combat operations in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iraq.</v>

81
00:04:01.001 --> 00:04:04.690
<v Speaker 1>Tens of thousands of security contractor</v>
<v Speaker 1>supplied necessary goods and services to</v>

82
00:04:04.691 --> 00:04:06.970
<v Speaker 1>the troops as they toppled Saddam's </v>
<v Speaker 1>regime.</v>

83
00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:09.280
<v Speaker 1>And when the invasion ended and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>occupation began,</v>

84
00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:10.293
<v Speaker 1>contractors only grew in number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The government was outsourcing its </v>

85
00:04:12.221 --> 00:04:14.650
<v Speaker 1>responsibilities to the point of </v>
<v Speaker 1>confusion.</v>

86
00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.820
<v Speaker 1>April 2004 for contractors from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>company called Blackwater were killed,</v>

87
00:04:18.821 --> 00:04:19.654
<v Speaker 1>burned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and dragged through the streets of </v>

88
00:04:20.591 --> 00:04:21.424
<v Speaker 1>Fallujah and central Iran.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This footage was released to the news </v>

89
00:04:23.381 --> 00:04:24.214
<v Speaker 1>outlets and it prompted a revenge </v>
<v Speaker 1>mission to recapture the city Operation </v>

90
00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.800
<v Speaker 1>Vigilante resolved in which 27 Americans</v>
<v Speaker 1>were killed.</v>

91
00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.490
<v Speaker 1>One hundred 80 and surgeons and 600 </v>
<v Speaker 1>Iraqi civilians,</v>

92
00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.353
<v Speaker 1>you see security contractors don't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>access to all the tactical information </v>

93
00:04:36.731 --> 00:04:38.170
<v Speaker 1>that the troops have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet still,</v>

94
00:04:38.171 --> 00:04:40.750
<v Speaker 1>they carry guns and operate within all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same theaters of conflict.</v>

95
00:04:40.751 --> 00:04:41.584
<v Speaker 1>They don't fall into the chain of </v>
<v Speaker 1>command so they can leave anytime they </v>

96
00:04:43.571 --> 00:04:45.700
<v Speaker 1>want to get multimillion dollar </v>
<v Speaker 1>contracts with the State Department,</v>

97
00:04:45.701 --> 00:04:46.534
<v Speaker 1>but being private companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have to provide itemized </v>

98
00:04:48.041 --> 00:04:48.874
<v Speaker 1>records of where the money is going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps the most troubling thing of all </v>

99
00:04:50.621 --> 00:04:54.510
<v Speaker 1>about plcs is that they don't fall under</v>
<v Speaker 1>the uniform code of military justice.</v>

100
00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.680
<v Speaker 1>That lack of accountability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that lack of oversight,</v>

101
00:04:56.681 --> 00:04:57.514
<v Speaker 1>which alarms many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the questionable deaths of dozens of </v>

102
00:04:59.021 --> 00:05:01.480
<v Speaker 1>Iraqis which will never be prosecuted as</v>
<v Speaker 1>the war ends.</v>

103
00:05:01.481 --> 00:05:02.314
<v Speaker 1>The contractors will stay indefinitely </v>
<v Speaker 1>to provide security for the embassy in </v>

104
00:05:04.991 --> 00:05:07.680
<v Speaker 1>Baghdad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iraq and Bosnia.</v>

105
00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:12.010
<v Speaker 1>The last being a city 20 miles from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>border of Iran and sitting on one of the</v>

106
00:05:12.011 --> 00:05:14.970
<v Speaker 1>largest oil fields in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

107
00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:16.420
<v Speaker 1>oil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexy,</v>

108
00:05:16.421 --> 00:05:18.310
<v Speaker 1>delicious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scrumptious.</v>

109
00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:19.383
<v Speaker 1>If I ran seizes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>control of it in one way or another </v>

110
00:05:20.411 --> 00:05:22.180
<v Speaker 1>weekend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see gas prices rise to five,</v>

111
00:05:22.181 --> 00:05:22.900
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven,</v>

112
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:23.733
<v Speaker 1>$10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

113
00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.410
<v Speaker 1>I think it's fair to say that the only </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason we went to Iraq was for the oil,</v>

114
00:05:26.411 --> 00:05:31.411
<v Speaker 1>but there's no doubt that in large part </v>
<v Speaker 1>and with the help of pmcs it's why we're</v>

115
00:05:31.451 --> 00:05:32.284
<v Speaker 1>staying.</v>

116
00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:45.163
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

117
00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.730
<v Speaker 1>Hello everybody and welcome to the </v>
