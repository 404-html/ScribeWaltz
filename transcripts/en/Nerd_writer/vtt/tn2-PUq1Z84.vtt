1
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.930
<v Speaker 1>The opening of the helm steep battle </v>
<v Speaker 1>scene in the two towers reminds me a lot</v>

2
00:00:14.931 --> 00:00:19.100
<v Speaker 1>of the opening scene from Sergio Leone </v>
<v Speaker 1>once upon a time in the west.</v>

3
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:20.353
<v Speaker 1>Both movies have classic scores,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but both use silence and some spare </v>

4
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.140
<v Speaker 1>foley sound effects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To set the stage,</v>

5
00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.120
<v Speaker 1>silence is important because a battle </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a shootout is all about contract.</v>

6
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.730
<v Speaker 1>Helm's deep is full of contrasts as a 39</v>
<v Speaker 1>minute sequence.</v>

7
00:00:41.731 --> 00:00:46.260
<v Speaker 1>It has to carry the dramatic weight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ups and downs of a mini movie within</v>

8
00:00:46.261 --> 00:00:48.450
<v Speaker 1>a movie to hold our attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

9
00:00:48.451 --> 00:00:51.750
<v Speaker 1>since the two towers is essentially the </v>
<v Speaker 1>middle of a larger story,</v>

10
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.770
<v Speaker 1>Peter Jackson and his co writer writers </v>
<v Speaker 1>needed the battle to be climactic enough</v>

11
00:00:55.771 --> 00:01:00.120
<v Speaker 1>to provide enough temporary closure that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the film could stand on its own.</v>

12
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.403
<v Speaker 1>In the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's that necessity which I think </v>

13
00:01:02.881 --> 00:01:03.714
<v Speaker 1>generated the best cinematic battle of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the trilogy and one of the best movie </v>

14
00:01:06.871 --> 00:01:07.704
<v Speaker 1>battles of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can break the home Steve Battle or </v>

15
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.393
<v Speaker 1>the battle of the Hornberger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as it's known in the books into 24 </v>

16
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.963
<v Speaker 1>beats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These beats provide a rough layout for </v>

17
00:01:17.011 --> 00:01:18.930
<v Speaker 1>the rhythm of the sequence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

18
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.630
<v Speaker 1>speaking of contrast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see looking at it this way,</v>

19
00:01:21.631 --> 00:01:24.960
<v Speaker 1>that a large part of the battle is </v>
<v Speaker 1>virtually monochromatic.</v>

20
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.840
<v Speaker 1>The late great cinematographer Andrew </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lesson,</v>

21
00:01:26.841 --> 00:01:27.674
<v Speaker 1>he had a really difficult task of </v>
<v Speaker 1>maintaining the feel of a night battle </v>

22
00:01:30.991 --> 00:01:31.824
<v Speaker 1>and the rain while making sure that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>visuals were intelligible enough to the </v>

23
00:01:34.531 --> 00:01:35.364
<v Speaker 1>viewer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He does this by infusing the scene with </v>

24
00:01:37.141 --> 00:01:40.110
<v Speaker 1>a strong bluish backlight extensively </v>
<v Speaker 1>the moon,</v>

25
00:01:40.111 --> 00:01:43.980
<v Speaker 1>which draws out edges and by keeping the</v>
<v Speaker 1>color palate very limited,</v>

26
00:01:43.981 --> 00:01:48.390
<v Speaker 1>he ensures that shots aren't too busy </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the eyes and brains of the audience.</v>

27
00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.230
<v Speaker 1>Intelligibility is really important for </v>
<v Speaker 1>a giant set piece like this.</v>

28
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.140
<v Speaker 1>Not only do you want the audience to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to see what's happening,</v>

29
00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.250
<v Speaker 1>you want them to have a sense of how the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting is developing for each side,</v>

30
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.730
<v Speaker 1>which is why these 24 narrative beats </v>
<v Speaker 1>are crucial.</v>

31
00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:03.803
<v Speaker 1>Each beat represents an action or </v>
<v Speaker 1>development that carries an emotional </v>

32
00:02:07.171 --> 00:02:09.750
<v Speaker 1>cue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's the feeling of anticipation</v>

33
00:02:09.751 --> 00:02:12.180
<v Speaker 1>at the start or the feeling of </v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability.</v>

34
00:02:12.181 --> 00:02:13.014
<v Speaker 1>When the euro explode,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the deepening wall and March up the </v>

35
00:02:15.481 --> 00:02:18.480
<v Speaker 1>causeway or the feeling of hope at </v>
<v Speaker 1>sunrise,</v>

36
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.510
<v Speaker 1>and when Gandalf finally arrives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were to graph the progress of the</v>

37
00:02:23.791 --> 00:02:24.624
<v Speaker 1>battle using these 24 beats along an </v>
<v Speaker 1>axis of how close the heroes were to </v>

38
00:02:28.651 --> 00:02:32.310
<v Speaker 1>victory or defeat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would look something like this.</v>

39
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.203
<v Speaker 1>What strikes me right away is that this </v>
<v Speaker 1>shape resembles almost exactly a </v>

40
00:02:37.351 --> 00:02:41.590
<v Speaker 1>traditional story arc in miniature </v>
<v Speaker 1>complete with inciting</v>

41
00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:42.493
<v Speaker 2>incident,</v>

42
00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.230
<v Speaker 1>growing obstacles,</v>

43
00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:55.800
<v Speaker 2>mini triumphs,</v>

44
00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.760
<v Speaker 1>and a roaring Victoria's climax just </v>
<v Speaker 1>when things are at their most.</v>

45
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.833
<v Speaker 1>Steve really is a movie within a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has a fully realized narrative </v>

46
00:03:19.471 --> 00:03:20.304
<v Speaker 1>structure that that parallels the </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative shape of the trilogy where </v>

47
00:03:23.581 --> 00:03:24.414
<v Speaker 1>things get darker and darker and closer </v>
<v Speaker 1>to defeat with some small victories </v>

48
00:03:28.291 --> 00:03:30.570
<v Speaker 1>along the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including home steep itself,</v>

49
00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.170
<v Speaker 1>but only at the very end when all hope </v>
<v Speaker 1>is lost.</v>

50
00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.063
<v Speaker 1>Does the climactic triumph occur?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Having a complete narrative arc like </v>

51
00:03:38.461 --> 00:03:42.300
<v Speaker 1>this is how you keep an audience </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in a 39 minute sequence,</v>

52
00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.360
<v Speaker 1>but to keep them invested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to do even more.</v>

53
00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.710
<v Speaker 1>As I said before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>home steep is full of contrasts of close</v>

54
00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:50.663
<v Speaker 1>hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hand fighting contrast with sweeping </v>

55
00:03:52.741 --> 00:03:55.230
<v Speaker 1>crane shots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>moments of levity,</v>

56
00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:02.160
<v Speaker 1>elvish contrast with moments of tragedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>darkness contrasts with light,</v>

57
00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.153
<v Speaker 1>but with violent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this reckless hate with moral </v>

58
00:04:07.561 --> 00:04:08.394
<v Speaker 1>conviction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the contrasts that Lord of the </v>

59
00:04:10.141 --> 00:04:14.880
<v Speaker 1>rings always has to balance is the one </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the real and the mythic.</v>

60
00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.840
<v Speaker 1>The film has to be emotionally realistic</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to register on a personal level,</v>

61
00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:22.530
<v Speaker 1>but it also has to have that extra </v>
<v Speaker 1>heightened element of fantasy,</v>

62
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.560
<v Speaker 1>of myth as if we're watching something </v>
<v Speaker 1>more perfect than a true story can be.</v>

63
00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.570
<v Speaker 1>You see that in color Palette like I </v>
<v Speaker 1>mentioned,</v>

64
00:04:30.571 --> 00:04:33.920
<v Speaker 1>but also in the rain and smoking other </v>
<v Speaker 1>atmospherics,</v>

65
00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:39.140
<v Speaker 1>the peppered use of slow motion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course there are shots like this.</v>

66
00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.310
<v Speaker 1>It's these things that make the scenes </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative arc three dimensional,</v>

67
00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:45.540
<v Speaker 1>Peter Jackson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Andrew,</v>

68
00:04:45.541 --> 00:04:46.374
<v Speaker 1>less neat and the crews and actors who </v>
<v Speaker 1>spent four months of night shoots </v>

69
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:50.333
<v Speaker 1>filming the sequence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only made it easily comprehensible </v>

70
00:04:52.891 --> 00:04:53.724
<v Speaker 1>for audiences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also resonate with the rest of the </v>

71
00:04:56.281 --> 00:05:01.281
<v Speaker 1>film on the theme of darkness contrasted</v>
<v Speaker 1>with light that defines the trilogy.</v>

72
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:07.400
<v Speaker 1>Helm's deep is at once self contained </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a critical part of something bigger.</v>

73
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.280
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not only a masterful sequence helps</v>

74
00:05:11.281 --> 00:05:14.880
<v Speaker 1>the is the reason why epic battles.</v>
