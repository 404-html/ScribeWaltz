1
00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.360
<v Speaker 1>Colson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get back to base.</v>

2
00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:03.190
<v Speaker 1>This is a level seven.</v>

3
00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.680
<v Speaker 2>As of right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are at war.</v>

4
00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:10.413
<v Speaker 2>We do.</v>

5
00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.043
<v Speaker 1>One of the things you got to love about </v>
<v Speaker 1>just weeding is that he rarely lets a </v>

6
00:00:26.351 --> 00:00:30.370
<v Speaker 1>detail go to waste.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My favorite example is what you just saw</v>

7
00:00:30.371 --> 00:00:35.371
<v Speaker 1>from the first avengers movie when he </v>
<v Speaker 1>uses the film title card literally as an</v>

8
00:00:35.561 --> 00:00:39.580
<v Speaker 1>answer to a question that's been posed </v>
<v Speaker 1>by a character on screen.</v>

9
00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:40.743
<v Speaker 1>It's a great little joke because it sets</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tone for the whole movie by drawing </v>

10
00:00:43.991 --> 00:00:47.350
<v Speaker 1>attention to the films.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Packaging Wieden is letting us know that</v>

11
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:48.513
<v Speaker 1>he knows that this is just a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's not going to take itself too </v>

12
00:00:51.311 --> 00:00:54.530
<v Speaker 1>seriously and that there are going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>jokes that matters.</v>

13
00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:55.483
<v Speaker 1>Playing Gallagher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he does a similar thing at the end of </v>

14
00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.050
<v Speaker 1>avengers to using a creative cut that </v>
<v Speaker 1>literally plants a word in your head.</v>

15
00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.290
<v Speaker 1>Fleet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're all thinking of the same word.</v>

16
00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:11.690
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now maybe</v>

17
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:12.523
<v Speaker 1>it's a small thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the way art is packaged has always </v>

18
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.273
<v Speaker 1>fascinated me because packaging like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is just another thing that the </v>

19
00:01:20.061 --> 00:01:23.540
<v Speaker 1>artists has to choose it all to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>creative decision,</v>

20
00:01:23.541 --> 00:01:26.810
<v Speaker 1>like all the creative decisions that </v>
<v Speaker 1>went into the work itself.</v>

21
00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.093
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're dealing with big properties </v>

22
00:01:29.391 --> 00:01:32.840
<v Speaker 1>and millions of dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>artists don't always or even usually get</v>

23
00:01:32.841 --> 00:01:35.630
<v Speaker 1>to choose what a film or a book title is</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be.</v>

24
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:36.673
<v Speaker 1>The book cover or the movie poster is </v>
<v Speaker 1>often designed with commercial </v>

25
00:01:39.531 --> 00:01:40.364
<v Speaker 1>incentives in mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not the case for all art </v>

26
00:01:42.651 --> 00:01:47.300
<v Speaker 1>forms or even all forms of packaging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't obviously had to name his film</v>

27
00:01:47.301 --> 00:01:48.134
<v Speaker 1>the Avengers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he found an interesting way to work </v>

28
00:01:50.211 --> 00:01:52.670
<v Speaker 1>that title into the film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Similarly,</v>

29
00:01:52.671 --> 00:01:53.504
<v Speaker 1>in the 2006 James Bond Movie Casino </v>
<v Speaker 1>Royale director Martin Campbell and the </v>

30
00:01:57.051 --> 00:01:57.884
<v Speaker 1>bond team,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're looking to reboot the franchise </v>

31
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.820
<v Speaker 1>for a post Austin powers.</v>

32
00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:02.653
<v Speaker 1>Posts can't be era to make it more </v>
<v Speaker 1>gritty and in line with the best action </v>

33
00:02:06.321 --> 00:02:09.710
<v Speaker 1>films of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously they had to include the iconic</v>

34
00:02:09.711 --> 00:02:13.460
<v Speaker 1>gunbarrel sequence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but by foregoing the normal.dot</v>

35
00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.430
<v Speaker 1>dot gunbarrel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead working it into the story,</v>

36
00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:21.460
<v Speaker 1>they broadcast the message that this </v>
<v Speaker 1>bond is a different beast altogether.</v>

37
00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.820
<v Speaker 1>My interest in this kind of packaging,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think springs from epigraphs.</v>

38
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.400
<v Speaker 1>Those quotes you see at the beginning of</v>
<v Speaker 1>books,</v>

39
00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:29.323
<v Speaker 1>I use graphs to signal that the reader </v>
<v Speaker 1>should look in this direction while </v>

40
00:02:33.081 --> 00:02:36.290
<v Speaker 1>reading that they should keep certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>things in mind pass.</v>

41
00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.510
<v Speaker 1>That's a favorite writer of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>m John Harrison,</v>

42
00:02:38.511 --> 00:02:39.344
<v Speaker 1>who I think hits the point exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>epigraphs indeed all the trappings that </v>

43
00:02:42.651 --> 00:02:46.850
<v Speaker 1>exist in and around a work of art are in</v>
<v Speaker 1>some way a part of it.</v>

44
00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.963
<v Speaker 1>Their instructions or simply suggestions</v>
<v Speaker 1>on how to receive the project in </v>

45
00:02:52.251 --> 00:02:53.084
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a good example from Terentino's </v>

46
00:02:54.621 --> 00:02:55.454
<v Speaker 1>grindhouse feature death proof,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which couches the story in the look and </v>

47
00:02:58.251 --> 00:02:59.084
<v Speaker 1>feel of exploitation genre movies of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>19 seventies all the way down to the </v>

48
00:03:02.681 --> 00:03:07.180
<v Speaker 1>grainy film stock and the fake trailers </v>
<v Speaker 1>for similarly styled b movies.</v>

49
00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.410
<v Speaker 3>These kinds of touches,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not directly part of the</v>

50
00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:14.533
<v Speaker 1>self paint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The immediate space around the movie </v>

51
00:03:16.821 --> 00:03:17.654
<v Speaker 1>with a kind of aura that sets the mood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course there are plenty of examples </v>

52
00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.830
<v Speaker 1>of beautiful title sequences going back </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the history of film.</v>

53
00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.873
<v Speaker 1>The king of them all is Saul Bass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the designer behind everything from </v>

54
00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.620
<v Speaker 1>psycho and Vertigo to Goodfellas and </v>
<v Speaker 1>casino,</v>

55
00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.780
<v Speaker 1>and here's how bass use his job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had</v>

56
00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:38.383
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the audience involvement with a </v>

57
00:03:39.741 --> 00:03:40.574
<v Speaker 4>film should really begin with the very </v>
<v Speaker 4>first frame seemed to be a real </v>

58
00:03:43.911 --> 00:03:44.744
<v Speaker 4>opportunity to use titles in a new way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually create a climate for the story </v>

59
00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:51.920
<v Speaker 4>that was about to unfold.</v>

60
00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.960
<v Speaker 1>That's his philosophy of establishing </v>
<v Speaker 1>the film is the climate lives on.</v>

61
00:03:55.961 --> 00:03:59.230
<v Speaker 1>Even if extended title sequences are </v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming a little less common.</v>

62
00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:00.423
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been noticing a lot of these title </v>

63
00:04:01.371 --> 00:04:05.410
<v Speaker 1>sequences moving to the end of films.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The closing credits of Blue Valentine,</v>

64
00:04:05.411 --> 00:04:06.400
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>features,</v>

65
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:07.503
<v Speaker 1>quick firework,</v>
<v Speaker 1>glimpses of the relationship that just </v>

66
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.300
<v Speaker 1>ended with the film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember watching these credits in the</v>

67
00:04:13.301 --> 00:04:14.134
<v Speaker 1>theater and being completely transfixed </v>
<v Speaker 1>as they send your mind back across the </v>

68
00:04:18.881 --> 00:04:22.540
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making the heartbreak of the ending even</v>

69
00:04:22.541 --> 00:04:25.240
<v Speaker 1>more poignant and on the complete other </v>
<v Speaker 1>side of the spectrum,</v>

70
00:04:25.241 --> 00:04:26.074
<v Speaker 1>the closing credit sequence of 22 jump </v>
<v Speaker 1>street is a brilliant send up of </v>

71
00:04:29.441 --> 00:04:32.830
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood's franchise mentality of </v>
<v Speaker 1>endless sequels.</v>

72
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.863
<v Speaker 1>It's maybe the first time I've ever seen</v>
<v Speaker 1>a credit sequence that is even funnier </v>

73
00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:38.063
<v Speaker 1>than and already hilarious movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the examples I love most is the </v>

74
00:04:42.791 --> 00:04:46.930
<v Speaker 1>title sequence from Francoise Truffaut's</v>
<v Speaker 1>adaptation of Fahrenheit 4:51,</v>

75
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:51.130
<v Speaker 1>a story about a society that doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>allow it to citizens to read books,</v>

76
00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.440
<v Speaker 1>so to banish words from the viewer's </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>

77
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.710
<v Speaker 1>Truffaut has the opening titles read </v>
<v Speaker 1>aloud.</v>

78
00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.843
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

79
00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:02.920
<v Speaker 4>I'm a novel by Ray Bradbury music by </v>
<v Speaker 4>comment back to a photography.</v>

80
00:05:03.851 --> 00:05:04.684
<v Speaker 4>Nicholas Roeg.</v>

81
00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:06.223
<v Speaker 1>Not every film or every piece of art </v>
<v Speaker 1>needs to pay so much attention to the </v>

82
00:05:09.321 --> 00:05:10.154
<v Speaker 1>packaging that surrounds it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I love something like this because </v>

83
00:05:12.861 --> 00:05:13.694
<v Speaker 1>it actually adds to the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same could be said for the title </v>

84
00:05:16.581 --> 00:05:17.414
<v Speaker 1>sequence of the wire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which entwines fragments of all the </v>

85
00:05:20.481 --> 00:05:21.314
<v Speaker 1>narrative perspectives of the show and </v>
<v Speaker 1>even some footage from the episodes </v>

86
00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:25.103
<v Speaker 1>themselves and puts them on an equal </v>
<v Speaker 1>footing reinforcing creator David </v>

87
00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:30.223
<v Speaker 1>Simon's maxim that the wire is not about</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jim McNulty or Avon Barksdale or crime </v>

88
00:05:34.611 --> 00:05:38.750
<v Speaker 1>or punishment or drugs or violence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about the city.</v>

89
00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:42.470
<v Speaker 1>These titles I think do a little more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than echo the theme.</v>

90
00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:43.783
<v Speaker 1>They helped to develop it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All artists are trying in some way to </v>

91
00:05:47.061 --> 00:05:47.894
<v Speaker 1>get their intentions across to an </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience even if that intention is to </v>

92
00:05:50.841 --> 00:05:54.500
<v Speaker 1>make the packaging around their work as </v>
<v Speaker 1>minimal as possible.</v>

93
00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:55.543
<v Speaker 1>A number of painters don't title their </v>
<v Speaker 1>canvases example or simply named them </v>

94
00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:59.570
<v Speaker 1>with a number.</v>

95
00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.960
<v Speaker 1>The idea here is to take the work on its</v>
<v Speaker 1>own terms.</v>

96
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.033
<v Speaker 1>Movies and books don't have that option,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when woody allen uses the same font </v>

97
00:06:07.461 --> 00:06:10.250
<v Speaker 1>and title sequence for every single </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie he's ever done,</v>

98
00:06:10.251 --> 00:06:14.600
<v Speaker 1>the point I think is to look beyond the </v>
<v Speaker 1>titles to the film itself,</v>

99
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:18.740
<v Speaker 1>but even that nondecision is a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>decision.</v>

100
00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:21.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the title isn't the most important thing</v>

101
00:06:21.501 --> 00:06:22.334
<v Speaker 1>about a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but attention to detail is something </v>

102
00:06:24.351 --> 00:06:27.320
<v Speaker 1>that I appreciate as a film goer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

103
00:06:27.321 --> 00:06:28.154
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to spend all that time </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all that money making a feature </v>

104
00:06:31.551 --> 00:06:32.384
<v Speaker 1>film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why not try to make everything in and </v>

105
00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:36.420
<v Speaker 1>around it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meaning,</v>

106
00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.850
<v Speaker 2>forget it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't go in two minutes.</v>

107
00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:40.140
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't do it.</v>

108
00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:41.460
<v Speaker 2>We've blown it already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

109
00:06:41.461 --> 00:06:43.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't go into,</v>

110
00:06:43.101 --> 00:06:46.590
<v Speaker 2>in a minute in the Middle East,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the titles there in Swedish,</v>

111
00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:54.920
<v Speaker 1>there is a nerd writer video every </v>
<v Speaker 1>Wednesday.</v>

112

<v Speaker 1>you'll subscribe to this channel and get</v>

113
00:06:58.041 --> 00:06:58.874

114
00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:05.890
<v Speaker 1>My girlfriend is just scared the shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of me.</v>

115
00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:08.650
<v Speaker 1>I have to think squarespace for </v>
<v Speaker 1>sponsoring this video.</v>
