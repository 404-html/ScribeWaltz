00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.670
<v Speaker 1>When you're smiling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're smiling,</v>

2
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:16.710
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why did I do that?</v>

3
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.080
<v Speaker 1>When people evaluate great actors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what often gets mentioned most is range,</v>

4
00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.390
<v Speaker 1>how many different characters they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>play,</v>

5
00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.260
<v Speaker 1>how many different emotions they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>realistically movingly show,</v>

6
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.120
<v Speaker 1>but I think a criteria and that's just </v>
<v Speaker 1>as telling as range is depth.</v>

7
00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.050
<v Speaker 1>How many different ways and actor can </v>
<v Speaker 1>portray the same emotion.</v>

8
00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:40.393
<v Speaker 1>I spent the last few weeks watching </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty much every film Jack Nicholson </v>

9
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.460
<v Speaker 1>ever made and it's clear that the man </v>
<v Speaker 1>can do it all,</v>

10
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.020
<v Speaker 1>but it's also no mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That intensity is calling card today.</v>

11
00:00:51.021 --> 00:00:51.854
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to explore the ways that Jack </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nicholson conveys and uses anger in his </v>

12
00:00:55.581 --> 00:00:56.414
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The angles he approaches it from the </v>

13
00:00:57.771 --> 00:00:58.604
<v Speaker 1>spins and emphases he puts on it in </v>
<v Speaker 1>order to see what makes Jack Nicholson </v>

14
00:01:01.521 --> 00:01:02.354
<v Speaker 1>so great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anger is an emotional response or </v>

15
00:01:14.251 --> 00:01:17.790
<v Speaker 1>reaction to something that reaction </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifests psychologically,</v>

16
00:01:17.791 --> 00:01:18.624
<v Speaker 1>but also physically and everyone's had </v>
<v Speaker 1>that sensation of being convulsed with </v>

17
00:01:22.831 --> 00:01:23.664
<v Speaker 1>anger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What Nicholson shows again and again in </v>

18
00:01:25.681 --> 00:01:29.940
<v Speaker 1>his roles is how anger can literally </v>
<v Speaker 1>possess the body like a spirit,</v>

19
00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.170
<v Speaker 2>because I really want to know because it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a mistake,</v>

20
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.690
<v Speaker 2>maybe we could do something about it.</v>

21
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.770
<v Speaker 1>This is the moment when anger becomes </v>
<v Speaker 1>aggression.</v>

22
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.113
<v Speaker 1>Half the time that aggression in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nicholson's work is realized as actual </v>

23
00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:44.463
<v Speaker 1>violence against someone else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's psychotic violence or in </v>

24
00:01:47.771 --> 00:01:48.604
<v Speaker 1>some way justify the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Half of the time this theatrical anger </v>

25
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.310
<v Speaker 1>takes place in Nicholson's own personal </v>
<v Speaker 1>space.</v>

26
00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.870
<v Speaker 1>He flails around sometimes as a threat </v>
<v Speaker 1>or a suggestion of violence to come.</v>

27
00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.490
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the time it's just a release,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a discharge of pent up energy.</v>

28
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.110
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these moments,</v>

29
00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:08.973
<v Speaker 1>the weird contortions and spasms that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nicholson makes are more poignant than </v>

30
00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:13.773
<v Speaker 1>actual attacks on people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are kind of exploration of the </v>

31
00:02:16.931 --> 00:02:21.931
<v Speaker 1>relationship between body and mind and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it never feels like overacting.</v>

32
00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:22.803
<v Speaker 1>I think that's because these </v>
<v Speaker 1>gesticulation are all unique to the </v>

33
00:02:26.171 --> 00:02:29.920
<v Speaker 1>particular anger that they spring from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's focused,</v>

34
00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.970
<v Speaker 1>pointed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anger,</v>

35
00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.580
<v Speaker 1>or generally frustrated anger or </v>
<v Speaker 1>petulant child.</v>

36
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.320
<v Speaker 3>We'll have to leave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not taking any more of your time,</v>

37
00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:45.693
<v Speaker 3>Nicholson,</v>

38
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.700
<v Speaker 1>and everybody else for that matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anger can be a form of desperation,</v>

39
00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:50.623
<v Speaker 1>annoys so loud that you don't have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>hear your own insecurities and Mike </v>

40
00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:55.461
<v Speaker 1>Nichols,</v>
<v Speaker 1>carnal knowledge.</v>

41
00:02:55.461 --> 00:02:56.294
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nichols plays a playboy who objectifies </v>

42
00:02:58.251 --> 00:02:59.084
<v Speaker 1>women and refuses to commit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of his lovers asks him to get </v>

43
00:03:01.661 --> 00:03:03.460
<v Speaker 1>married and he explodes.</v>

44
00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:04.753
<v Speaker 3>Fuck is my shoe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or this place is a mess out half the </v>

45
00:03:08.131 --> 00:03:09.900
<v Speaker 3>time you looked like it fell out of bed.</v>

46
00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.853
<v Speaker 1>Nicholson acts a kind of anger here that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's easy to see right through the </v>

47
00:03:14.101 --> 00:03:14.934
<v Speaker 1>larger and louder it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The closer he is to recognizing a </v>

48
00:03:17.521 --> 00:03:18.860
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability in himself.</v>

49
00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.790
<v Speaker 3>Do you want an extra $50 a week?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Try back.</v>

50
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.590
<v Speaker 3>You mean you want an extra hundred </v>
<v Speaker 3>dollars?</v>

51
00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.630
<v Speaker 3>Make this Goddamn goddamn window.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why he can stand up in here,</v>

52
00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:30.670
<v Speaker 3>the God damn place.</v>

53
00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.850
<v Speaker 1>That's the challenge for an actor </v>
<v Speaker 1>playing this emotion.</v>

54
00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.450
<v Speaker 1>You're not just playing anger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're playing what's under it.</v>

55
00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:39.493
<v Speaker 1>Most anger isn't psychotic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's only a thin veneer for what's </v>

56
00:03:42.471 --> 00:03:43.304
<v Speaker 1>brewing below and you have to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>turn up the volume while preserving </v>

57
00:03:46.641 --> 00:03:48.710
<v Speaker 1>traces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of this deeper motivation,</v>

58
00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.740
<v Speaker 1>that's what Nicholson excels at in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>border.</v>

59
00:03:51.741 --> 00:03:52.574
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nicholson plays a border agent who gets </v>

60
00:03:54.141 --> 00:03:56.840
<v Speaker 1>caught up with his partner is human </v>
<v Speaker 1>smuggling operation.</v>

61
00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.150
<v Speaker 1>When the partner starts killing his </v>
<v Speaker 1>competition,</v>

62
00:03:59.151 --> 00:03:59.984
<v Speaker 1>Nicholson realizes that he's gotten into</v>
<v Speaker 1>far the key emotion in this exchange is </v>

63
00:04:03.971 --> 00:04:05.720
<v Speaker 1>an anger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but fear,</v>

64
00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:06.763
<v Speaker 1>fear of what he's gotten himself into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fear that he won't be able to get </v>

65
00:04:08.991 --> 00:04:12.080
<v Speaker 1>himself out on Nicholson bursts with </v>
<v Speaker 1>anger here,</v>

66
00:04:12.081 --> 00:04:15.500
<v Speaker 1>but it's in the silent moments where the</v>
<v Speaker 1>actual feelings</v>

67
00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.710
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't care about your fucking money.</v>

68
00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.950
<v Speaker 3>Fucking life is going to be fine before </v>
<v Speaker 3>I ever get involved murder.</v>

69
00:04:20.951 --> 00:04:22.270
<v Speaker 3>You understand what I'm saying to you?</v>

70
00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.360
<v Speaker 1>This is why you Nicholson's characters </v>
<v Speaker 1>seem real in their anger.</v>

71
00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.430
<v Speaker 1>Even with great writing and great </v>
<v Speaker 1>direction.</v>

72
00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:30.503
<v Speaker 1>It's only the actor who can make a </v>
<v Speaker 1>character polyphonic like more than one </v>

73
00:04:33.421 --> 00:04:36.480
<v Speaker 1>thing is happening at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even when you do that,</v>

74
00:04:36.481 --> 00:04:37.314
<v Speaker 1>that particular expression of anger has </v>
<v Speaker 1>to rise out of the particular </v>

75
00:04:39.781 --> 00:04:41.880
<v Speaker 1>character's personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

76
00:04:41.881 --> 00:04:42.714
<v Speaker 1>take these two examples of anger which </v>
<v Speaker 1>are both underlaid with a strong sense </v>

77
00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.830
<v Speaker 1>of superiority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can't handle the truth.</v>

78
00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.193
<v Speaker 1>Son,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we live in a world that has walls and </v>

79
00:04:53.371 --> 00:04:55.800
<v Speaker 1>those walls have to be guarded by men </v>
<v Speaker 1>with guns.</v>

80
00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.170
<v Speaker 1>Who's gonna do it you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

81
00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.360
<v Speaker 1>Lieutenant Weinberg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never,</v>

82
00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.540
<v Speaker 1>never interrupt me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

83
00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:07.890
<v Speaker 1>Not if there's a fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not even if you hear the sound of a thud</v>

84
00:05:07.891 --> 00:05:11.220
<v Speaker 1>from my home in one week later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a smell coming from there.</v>

85
00:05:11.221 --> 00:05:12.054
<v Speaker 1>There can only be a decaying human body </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you have to hold Hanky to your face </v>

86
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.870
<v Speaker 1>because the stench is so thick that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think you're going to faint.</v>

87
00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:20.003
<v Speaker 1>Both of these men feel smarter and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>important than the person they're </v>

88
00:05:22.711 --> 00:05:23.544
<v Speaker 1>lecturing too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the first is a lifelong military </v>

89
00:05:26.071 --> 00:05:27.510
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a court of law,</v>

90
00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:32.550
<v Speaker 1>Nicholson barely moves his body or head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every swivel of the neck is measured and</v>

91
00:05:32.551 --> 00:05:33.384
<v Speaker 1>exact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You so restrained that a simple lean </v>

92
00:05:35.101 --> 00:05:37.260
<v Speaker 1>forward feels like he's lost it.</v>

93
00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.420
<v Speaker 3>I did the job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God damn right,</v>

94
00:05:40.421 --> 00:05:41.254
<v Speaker 3>I did.</v>

95
00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.760
<v Speaker 1>The second man is smug and in his own </v>
<v Speaker 1>space,</v>

96
00:05:44.761 --> 00:05:47.070
<v Speaker 1>his movements are freer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looser,</v>

97
00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.500
<v Speaker 1>and they even seemed to mock great </v>
<v Speaker 1>kinnear's,</v>

98
00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:53.400
<v Speaker 1>homosexuality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't know not on this,</v>

99
00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:59.930
<v Speaker 1>not for any reason you get me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sweetheart.</v>

100
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.100
<v Speaker 1>No two expressions of anger are the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same,</v>

101
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.530
<v Speaker 1>not in real life and not in Nicholson's </v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

102
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.930
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes his anger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his comedic,</v>

103
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:12.590
<v Speaker 1>sometimes cartoonish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it's quiet,</v>

104
00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:17.420
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it's misplaced and sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's deeply,</v>

105
00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:21.290
<v Speaker 1>deeply wounded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever you're doing stuff,</v>

106
00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:24.690
<v Speaker 3>whatever you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stop it.</v>

107
00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:32.550
<v Speaker 3>I hope you die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope you fucking die.</v>

108
00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:34.953
<v Speaker 1>Watching so much of Nicholson's acting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start to get a sense of the larger </v>

109
00:06:38.081 --> 00:06:41.380
<v Speaker 1>shape of anger as a human phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's extremes,</v>

110
00:06:41.381 --> 00:06:42.214
<v Speaker 1>its physicality and it's dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also its necessity in the course of </v>

111
00:06:46.571 --> 00:06:49.240
<v Speaker 1>a life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None of us can avoid anger.</v>

112
00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:52.660
<v Speaker 1>You can't remove it from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>constellation of feelings,</v>

113
00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:53.853
<v Speaker 1>but you can't understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jack Nicholson has a wide range of </v>

114
00:06:57.101 --> 00:07:00.580
<v Speaker 1>talents as wider range as an actor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as anybody else,</v>

115
00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:06.300
<v Speaker 1>and yet if all he ever did was give us </v>
<v Speaker 1>these 60 years of insights into anger,</v>

116
00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:10.600
<v Speaker 1>it would still be a career well spent.</v>

117
00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:18.440
