1
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:03.300
<v Speaker 1>Coffee on the Tuesday and black.</v>

2
00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:12.500
<v Speaker 2>Yay.</v>

3
00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.380
<v Speaker 1>So today I want to talk about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>greatest writer that ever lived.</v>

4
00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:28.640
<v Speaker 1>Now maybe you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe you don't know,</v>

5
00:00:28.641 --> 00:00:32.090
<v Speaker 1>but Roland emerick's new movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anonymous tickets is this Friday.</v>

6
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.430
<v Speaker 3>We'll know William Shakespeare,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the most famous author of all time,</v>

7
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.080
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>heard of 37 plays,</v>

8
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:40.973
<v Speaker 3>154 sonnets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Several epic poem and why we are here </v>

9
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.820
<v Speaker 3>today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what if I told you Shakespeare never</v>

10
00:00:50.821 --> 00:00:52.920
<v Speaker 3>wrote a single word.</v>

11
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.250
<v Speaker 1>Movies meant to explore the theory that </v>
<v Speaker 1>William Shakespeare,</v>

12
00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:56.103
<v Speaker 1>the average man from Stratford,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did not actually write any poems or </v>

13
00:00:58.661 --> 00:00:59.031
<v Speaker 1>playing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

14
00:00:59.031 --> 00:01:00.520
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy theories like this aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>new,</v>

15
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:01.423
<v Speaker 1>but it may be important to note that not</v>
<v Speaker 1>a single person doubted shakespeare </v>

16
00:01:03.051 --> 00:01:05.720
<v Speaker 1>until about 150 years after his death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In 17,</v>

17
00:01:05.721 --> 00:01:08.420
<v Speaker 1>69,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Herbert Lawrence publishes a book called</v>

18
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:09.463
<v Speaker 1>the life and adventures of common sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>suggests that the culprit might be in </v>

19
00:01:12.321 --> 00:01:15.260
<v Speaker 1>fact Francis Bacon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shakespeare depicted as a degenerate and</v>

20
00:01:15.261 --> 00:01:17.960
<v Speaker 1>a thief steals from the character called</v>
<v Speaker 1>wisdom,</v>

21
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.913
<v Speaker 1>who is the father of common sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And wisdom is meant to be amongst my </v>

22
00:01:22.101 --> 00:01:22.934
<v Speaker 1>father's baggage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She presently has designed upon a </v>

23
00:01:25.371 --> 00:01:26.204
<v Speaker 1>commonplace book in which was contained </v>
<v Speaker 1>and infinite variety of modes and forms </v>

24
00:01:30.201 --> 00:01:33.260
<v Speaker 1>to express all the different sentiments </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the human mind,</v>

25
00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:34.123
<v Speaker 1>but this allegation is forgotten in its </v>
<v Speaker 1>time and isn't revived until Delia bake </v>

26
00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.920
<v Speaker 1>in know relationships with the proper </v>
<v Speaker 1>treatment and her 582 page book,</v>

27
00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.550
<v Speaker 1>the philosophy of the plays of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Shakespeare unfold in it.</v>

28
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:43.383
<v Speaker 1>She suggests that Bacon was directing a </v>
<v Speaker 1>group of intellectuals who actually </v>

29
00:01:47.121 --> 00:01:48.980
<v Speaker 1>wrote all the place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

30
00:01:48.981 --> 00:01:49.814
<v Speaker 1>clever bacon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Bacon theory falls completely into </v>

31
00:01:51.531 --> 00:01:52.460
<v Speaker 1>madness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When in 18,</v>

32
00:01:52.461 --> 00:01:53.294
<v Speaker 1>88,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ignatius Donnelly starts claiming that </v>

33
00:01:54.831 --> 00:01:57.770
<v Speaker 1>he's found codes inside the texts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not all.</v>

34
00:01:57.771 --> 00:01:58.550
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bacon,</v>

35
00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:59.383
<v Speaker 1>according to Donald,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is also Christopher Marlowe and </v>

36
00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:02.543
<v Speaker 1>maintained to check out these two final </v>
<v Speaker 1>lines from the epilogue of the tempest </v>

37
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.510
<v Speaker 1>as you from crimes with pardon be </v>
<v Speaker 1>lecture,</v>

38
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.060
<v Speaker 1>indulgence set me free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>According to the audience.</v>

39
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.730
<v Speaker 1>These lines are actually an Anagram for </v>
<v Speaker 1>tempest of Francis Bacon.</v>

40
00:02:13.731 --> 00:02:17.780
<v Speaker 1>Lord Vellum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you narrow divulge me words?</v>

41
00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:18.673
<v Speaker 1>It is a shame that the literary appears </v>
<v Speaker 1>twice in the first lines in three times </v>

42
00:02:20.751 --> 00:02:24.020
<v Speaker 1>the second lines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no problem say that they come here,</v>

43
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.930
<v Speaker 1>just pop it apostrophe here and Bob's </v>
<v Speaker 1>your uncle.</v>

44
00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:27.793
<v Speaker 1>Apostrophes are so helpful like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the man who was more recently </v>

45
00:02:29.511 --> 00:02:31.670
<v Speaker 1>replaced back in as the elite contender,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the protagonist,</v>

46
00:02:31.671 --> 00:02:33.940
<v Speaker 1>the Roland emerick's film anonymous </v>
<v Speaker 1>Edward de Vere,</v>

47
00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:34.813
<v Speaker 1>the 17th earl a box for this theory was </v>
<v Speaker 1>advanced in two large books by Charlton </v>

48
00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:38.480
<v Speaker 1>alcorn and his wife.</v>

49
00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.313
<v Speaker 1>This star of England and the mysterious </v>
<v Speaker 1>William Shakespeare of the central </v>

50
00:02:41.481 --> 00:02:42.314
<v Speaker 1>arguments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the man from strapper couldn't </v>

51
00:02:43.281 --> 00:02:46.250
<v Speaker 1>possibly have had the brain or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience to write all those plays.</v>

52
00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.230
<v Speaker 1>Only the Lord could have written them to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do their,</v>

53
00:02:48.231 --> 00:02:49.064
<v Speaker 1>had the perfect social background,</v>
<v Speaker 1>living for years and Queen Elizabeth </v>

54
00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:52.473
<v Speaker 1>Court and three did not want his name to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be known because a writing plays was </v>

55
00:02:55.281 --> 00:02:58.940
<v Speaker 1>considered a vulgar pursuit for royalty </v>
<v Speaker 1>and be the place show so much slimy,</v>

56
00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.913
<v Speaker 1>corrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>loyal behavior that it would have just </v>

57
00:03:00.701 --> 00:03:04.280
<v Speaker 1>totally blown up his spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And let's not leave out the secret codes</v>

58
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:05.590
<v Speaker 1>single.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at this line from act one.</v>

59
00:03:05.591 --> 00:03:07.830
<v Speaker 1>Scene five of the time is that of joint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

60
00:03:07.831 --> 00:03:08.800
<v Speaker 1>curse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's right.</v>

61
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.080
<v Speaker 1>They never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was born to set it right.</v>

62
00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:13.650
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

63
00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:14.910
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

64
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:16.050
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

65
00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:17.550
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

66
00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:19.223
<v Speaker 4>Come on</v>

67
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:20.223
<v Speaker 1>about the poem by Ben Johnson and titled</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the Memory of my beloved William </v>

68
00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.210
<v Speaker 1>Shakespeare and that Johnson called </v>
<v Speaker 1>Shakespeare the swan of Avon.</v>

69
00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.380
<v Speaker 1>Oops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sticking to bear.</v>

70
00:03:26.381 --> 00:03:29.410
<v Speaker 1>Have property on the Avon River.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nevermind that Shakespeare was born in,</v>

71
00:03:29.411 --> 00:03:30.244
<v Speaker 1>died in Stratford on bond.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This Johnson poem was actually the </v>

72
00:03:32.321 --> 00:03:33.154
<v Speaker 1>preface to the first folio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the first time that all of </v>

73
00:03:35.201 --> 00:03:38.410
<v Speaker 1>Shakespeare's plays were collected in </v>
<v Speaker 1>one place in 16,</v>

74
00:03:38.411 --> 00:03:39.244
<v Speaker 1>23.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The folio was prepared by John </v>

75
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.540
<v Speaker 1>Hemorrhages and Henrico doctors who had </v>
<v Speaker 1>worked with Shakespeare for 20 years and</v>

76
00:03:43.541 --> 00:03:45.740
<v Speaker 1>gave him repeated credit of authorship </v>
<v Speaker 1>and nevermind.</v>

77
00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.590
<v Speaker 1>Also the Edward de Vere died in 16.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

78
00:03:47.591 --> 00:03:49.660
<v Speaker 1>four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a play like the tempest for example,</v>

79
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.370
<v Speaker 1>is clearly dated 2:16,</v>
<v Speaker 1>11.</v>

80
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.440
<v Speaker 1>You know the [inaudible] have an answer </v>
<v Speaker 1>for that.</v>

81
00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.350
<v Speaker 1>They have an answer for everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but each arm reaches further and further</v>

82
00:03:56.351 --> 00:03:59.110
<v Speaker 1>out of its socket to find connections </v>
<v Speaker 1>that just don't exist.</v>

83
00:03:59.111 --> 00:04:00.970
<v Speaker 1>And round and round we go.</v>

84
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.833
<v Speaker 1>Even Herman Melville and his final book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Billy Budd names the captain of the </v>

85
00:04:04.061 --> 00:04:05.740
<v Speaker 1>ship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indomitable Edward,</v>

86
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.080
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Melville later said on that subject,</v>

87
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.943
<v Speaker 1>the names of all fine authors are </v>
<v Speaker 1>fictitious ones simply standing as they </v>

88
00:04:12.341 --> 00:04:16.480
<v Speaker 1>do for the mystical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever alluding spirit of all beauty which</v>

89
00:04:16.481 --> 00:04:17.314
<v Speaker 1>ubiquitously possesses men of genius,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think we shouldn't let this make </v>

90
00:04:20.201 --> 00:04:23.230
<v Speaker 1>us complacent when it comes to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>smearing of Shakespeare's name.</v>

91
00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.093
<v Speaker 1>The people who don't have as much </v>
<v Speaker 1>craving for conspiracy as Roland </v>

92
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.360
<v Speaker 1>Emmerich won't suddenly be turned by his</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie,</v>

93
00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:29.223
<v Speaker 1>but the world is full of idiots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's full of people sitting on their </v>

94
00:04:30.581 --> 00:04:31.414
<v Speaker 1>couches and watching TV and watching the</v>
<v Speaker 1>trailer flicker by and saying to the </v>

95
00:04:33.821 --> 00:04:34.840
<v Speaker 1>other guy on the couch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

96
00:04:34.841 --> 00:04:35.501
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

97
00:04:35.501 --> 00:04:37.210
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He never did write those plays.</v>

98
00:04:37.211 --> 00:04:41.740
<v Speaker 1>There's like evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There needs to be some respect for human</v>

99
00:04:41.741 --> 00:04:42.574
<v Speaker 1>genius,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when that genius comes from </v>

100
00:04:44.201 --> 00:04:47.560
<v Speaker 1>simple beginnings because that is where </v>
<v Speaker 1>most genius comes from.</v>

101
00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.370
<v Speaker 1>It comes from Lincoln Shyer or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bronx,</v>

102
00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:52.383
<v Speaker 1>or it comes from Liverpool or Stratford.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It grows out of practice and it comes </v>

103
00:04:57.381 --> 00:04:59.660
<v Speaker 1>from the stars and I don't mean from </v>
<v Speaker 1>aliens.</v>

104
00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:00.553
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

105
00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:01.523
<v Speaker 1>I mean that a genius can be any person </v>
<v Speaker 1>who looks at a night sky full of stars </v>

106
00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:07.340
<v Speaker 1>and never gets over it for the rest of </v>
<v Speaker 1>his life.</v>

107
00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.800
<v Speaker 1>He does not in the stars to hold our </v>
<v Speaker 1>destiny,</v>

108
00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.120
<v Speaker 1>but in ourselves.</v>
