00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.480
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever heard a word for the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>time a word like,</v>

2
00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:06.403
<v Speaker 1>I dunno corpuscular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which by the way is an adjective </v>

3
00:00:08.481 --> 00:00:09.314
<v Speaker 1>describing twilight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the next day you see </v>

4
00:00:11.661 --> 00:00:12.494
<v Speaker 1>corpuscular again in a novel and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you see it again the next day in your </v>

5
00:00:17.301 --> 00:00:19.070
<v Speaker 1>biology textbook and you start to </v>
<v Speaker 1>wonder,</v>

6
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.113
<v Speaker 1>how is it possible that I've gone the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first 20 years of my life without ever </v>

7
00:00:23.631 --> 00:00:26.690
<v Speaker 1>seeing the word corpuscular and now in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the last week,</v>

8
00:00:26.691 --> 00:00:27.524
<v Speaker 1>I've seen crepuscular three times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I've experienced this strong </v>

9
00:00:31.251 --> 00:00:33.500
<v Speaker 1>feeling of coincidence before many </v>
<v Speaker 1>times,</v>

10
00:00:33.501 --> 00:00:34.334
<v Speaker 1>and there's a name for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called the Baader Meinhof </v>

11
00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.173
<v Speaker 1>phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody really knows why it's called </v>

12
00:00:39.741 --> 00:00:42.020
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The baader Meinhof group was a late 20th</v>

13
00:00:42.021 --> 00:00:44.830
<v Speaker 1>century leftwing millet infection from </v>
<v Speaker 1>west Germany.</v>

14
00:00:44.831 --> 00:00:45.664
<v Speaker 1>It's likely that the person who gave it </v>
<v Speaker 1>that name just happened to be awash in </v>

15
00:00:48.981 --> 00:00:51.190
<v Speaker 1>coincidentally baader Meinhof </v>
<v Speaker 1>references.</v>

16
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.430
<v Speaker 1>The more scientific name for this </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenon is the frequency illusion,</v>

17
00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.890
<v Speaker 1>and it's just another example of our old</v>
<v Speaker 1>friend,</v>

18
00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.770
<v Speaker 1>the cognitive bias at work.</v>

19
00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.730
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we see something for the first time</v>

20
00:01:01.731 --> 00:01:05.750
<v Speaker 1>and then many times directly thereafter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can lead us to believe that there's a</v>

21
00:01:05.751 --> 00:01:08.600
<v Speaker 1>greater synchronicity at work in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world around us.</v>

22
00:01:08.601 --> 00:01:09.434
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps it's an artifact of determinism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the feeling that everything happens for </v>

23
00:01:13.161 --> 00:01:13.994
<v Speaker 1>a reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The coincidence we feel is just too </v>

24
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.083
<v Speaker 1>astronomically unlikely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but of course the truth is that most </v>

25
00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:25.150
<v Speaker 1>bordering on all things don't happen for</v>
<v Speaker 1>a reason despite our intuition that they</v>

26
00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:26.084
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet it's just that intuition </v>

27
00:01:27.441 --> 00:01:28.274
<v Speaker 1>activated in the Baader Meinhof </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenon that gives us an interesting </v>

28
00:01:31.371 --> 00:01:32.204
<v Speaker 1>look into the machinery of the mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our brains are essentially pattern </v>

29
00:01:35.931 --> 00:01:40.490
<v Speaker 1>recognizing superheroes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>able to find meaning in countless pieces</v>

30
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.400
<v Speaker 1>of data,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's our ability to see words in</v>

31
00:01:43.401 --> 00:01:47.780
<v Speaker 1>a newspaper word search or to work out </v>
<v Speaker 1>through fine mathematics,</v>

32
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.720
<v Speaker 1>the natural laws of the universe for </v>
<v Speaker 1>this reason,</v>

33
00:01:50.721 --> 00:01:51.554
<v Speaker 1>stimuli which are excited sort of sit </v>
<v Speaker 1>and wait at the fore of the brain for </v>

34
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.040
<v Speaker 1>similar stimuli with which to identify a</v>
<v Speaker 1>pattern.</v>

35
00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.280
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you may have seen the word corpuscular a</v>

36
00:02:01.281 --> 00:02:05.610
<v Speaker 1>number of times in your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but your brain just wasn't interested.</v>

37
00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.140
<v Speaker 1>The frequency illusion is augmented by </v>
<v Speaker 1>two other phenomenon.</v>

38
00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.820
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the recency effect,</v>

39
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:11.673
<v Speaker 1>a cognitive bias that inflates the </v>
<v Speaker 1>importance of recent stimuli or </v>

40
00:02:14.991 --> 00:02:16.280
<v Speaker 1>observations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and second,</v>

41
00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:17.383
<v Speaker 1>by the confirmation bias,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which in this case is precisely your </v>

42
00:02:20.511 --> 00:02:21.344
<v Speaker 1>belief that you're seeing this new thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>all over the place and the frequency </v>

43
00:02:24.831 --> 00:02:25.664
<v Speaker 1>illusion can become confirmation bias </v>
<v Speaker 1>when our passive experience of </v>

44
00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:34.210
<v Speaker 1>repeatedly seeing a new thing turns into</v>
<v Speaker 1>an active search for still more examples</v>

45
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:35.713
<v Speaker 1>of the magic that summons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what's more interesting to me about </v>

46
00:02:38.451 --> 00:02:42.140
<v Speaker 1>this phenomenon is not the coincidence </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you think you see,</v>

47
00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:43.183
<v Speaker 1>but all the patterns that are zipping by</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your day to day life that you don't </v>

48
00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:47.743
<v Speaker 1>register at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The baader Meinhof illusion proves that </v>

49
00:02:49.851 --> 00:02:52.880
<v Speaker 1>we only see the things that we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking out for.</v>

50
00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.280
<v Speaker 1>This can be bad in the case of </v>
<v Speaker 1>confirmation bias,</v>

51
00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:56.413
<v Speaker 1>but it also goes to show how ignorance </v>
<v Speaker 1>can be maintained through a lack of </v>

52
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.263
<v Speaker 1>active learning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The more you prime your mind by reading </v>

53
00:03:03.671 --> 00:03:04.504
<v Speaker 1>and writing to see new patterns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more reality will unfold before you </v>

54
00:03:08.441 --> 00:03:11.440
<v Speaker 1>as an extraordinary mechanism of natural</v>
<v Speaker 1>laws.</v>

55
00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:16.441
<v Speaker 1>The more humanity will show itself to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>an empathetic and beautiful mess of self</v>

56
00:03:16.781 --> 00:03:17.614
<v Speaker 1>delusions and cognitive biases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could end this video like everybody </v>

57
00:03:20.681 --> 00:03:22.900
<v Speaker 1>else who writes articles about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>subject does.</v>

58
00:03:22.901 --> 00:03:27.340
<v Speaker 1>By saying that you'll probably see the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Baader Meinhof phenomenon again sometime</v>

59
00:03:27.341 --> 00:03:28.174
<v Speaker 1>soon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but of course those people weren't </v>

60
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.110
<v Speaker 1>talking about the Baader Meinhof </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenon.</v>

61
00:03:32.111 --> 00:03:37.111
<v Speaker 1>Merely as a ruse to get you to take more</v>
<v Speaker 1>notice of the word crepuscular</v>

62
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:40.870
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I was doing.</v>

63
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.450
<v Speaker 1>Hey everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for watching.</v>

64
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.710
<v Speaker 1>Sorry I was a little bit late last week </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the video.</v>

65
00:03:44.711 --> 00:03:45.544
<v Speaker 1>I was traveling all over God's creation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just didn't have the time to finish </v>

66
00:03:48.491 --> 00:03:49.324
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was wondering if you like the </v>

67
00:03:50.411 --> 00:03:52.990
<v Speaker 1>understanding art house feature that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>did last week.</v>

68
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:54.183
<v Speaker 1>It's a little bit different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was thinking of doing it as a </v>

69
00:03:55.361 --> 00:03:57.970
<v Speaker 1>series sprinkled in between other </v>
<v Speaker 1>videos.</v>

70
00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.080
<v Speaker 1>Tell me what you think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

71
00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.750
<v Speaker 1>I sort of like putting out the video on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Monday.</v>

72
00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:04.600
<v Speaker 1>I might continue to do that instead of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Friday.</v>

73
00:04:04.601 --> 00:04:05.434
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just feel like it gives more </v>

74
00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.280
<v Speaker 1>opportunity for people to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The weekend people usually check out.</v>

75
00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:10.810
<v Speaker 1>Let me know what you think about that as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

76
00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:14.950
<v Speaker 1>Follow me on Tumbler and twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Discussed this video in the comments and</v>

77
00:04:14.951 --> 00:04:15.784
<v Speaker 1>post this on reddit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have any heart at all for me and </v>

78
00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.010
<v Speaker 1>continuing to do this and I love you so </v>
<v Speaker 1>much for that,</v>

79
00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.960
<v Speaker 1>I will see you next time.</v>
