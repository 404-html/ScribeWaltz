<v Speaker 1>Animal crackers on the Tuesday and blog </v>
<v Speaker 1>29.</v>

2
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.840
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

3
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.540
<v Speaker 1>so when we look at a map of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see countries,</v>

4
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.330
<v Speaker 1>countries divided up by very neatly </v>
<v Speaker 1>drawn lines,</v>

5
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.370
<v Speaker 1>lines which have a nice sense of </v>
<v Speaker 1>finality to them,</v>

6
00:00:23.371 --> 00:00:24.204
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This land belongs to this country and </v>

7
00:00:25.591 --> 00:00:28.560
<v Speaker 1>that land on the other side of this line</v>
<v Speaker 1>belongs to that one.</v>

8
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.230
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know that the geopolitical reality is</v>

9
00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:33.630
<v Speaker 1>anything but as conclusive as these </v>
<v Speaker 1>lines suggest.</v>

10
00:00:33.631 --> 00:00:37.350
<v Speaker 1>We know that there is civil fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>contestations of land and ownership,</v>

11
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.850
<v Speaker 1>local loyalties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>local hatreds,</v>

12
00:00:38.851 --> 00:00:39.684
<v Speaker 1>religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sex and factions who can and often do </v>

13
00:00:42.121 --> 00:00:46.320
<v Speaker 1>flip their noses at straight lines drawn</v>
<v Speaker 1>in comfy rooms by foreigners.</v>

14
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.333
<v Speaker 1>At some time in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've come to use and our global </v>

15
00:00:49.051 --> 00:00:49.884
<v Speaker 1>parlance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the word nation state to identify these </v>

16
00:00:52.171 --> 00:00:53.004
<v Speaker 1>places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a term we don't think too much </v>

17
00:00:54.331 --> 00:00:55.164
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We use it freely without going to our </v>

18
00:00:56.101 --> 00:00:57.570
<v Speaker 1>dictionaries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the truth is,</v>

19
00:00:57.571 --> 00:01:02.250
<v Speaker 1>of course that nation state as a term </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite often fails to adequately describe</v>

20
00:01:02.251 --> 00:01:03.990
<v Speaker 1>many of these countries where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

21
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.940
<v Speaker 1>civil war is a continuing reality.</v>

22
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.290
<v Speaker 1>So maybe by pulling the term apart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can get a better understanding of how</v>

23
00:01:10.291 --> 00:01:13.620
<v Speaker 1>these two words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nation and state can come together.</v>

24
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.800
<v Speaker 1>Now the state is what can be defined by </v>
<v Speaker 1>lines on a map.</v>

25
00:01:16.801 --> 00:01:17.634
<v Speaker 1>The area over which the state central </v>
<v Speaker 1>power called the sovereign has </v>

26
00:01:20.881 --> 00:01:21.714
<v Speaker 1>controlled the sovereign in theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has a monopoly on all the violence that </v>

27
00:01:24.931 --> 00:01:27.270
<v Speaker 1>occurs in the state and on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>international stage.</v>

28
00:01:27.271 --> 00:01:31.020
<v Speaker 1>The sovereigns voice in theory is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>equal among other saffrons.</v>

29
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.240
<v Speaker 1>This is the basic definition of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sovereignty,</v>

30
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.253
<v Speaker 1>equal abroad master at home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was John Bowden and the 16th century </v>

31
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.040
<v Speaker 1>who first laid out these characteristics</v>
<v Speaker 1>in his six books of the Commonwealth.</v>

32
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.350
<v Speaker 1>Thereafter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beaudin and others having worked at it's</v>

33
00:01:43.351 --> 00:01:44.184
<v Speaker 1>used,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to figure out where the source of </v>

34
00:01:45.631 --> 00:01:46.464
<v Speaker 1>sovereignty light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but and believed as was the custom of </v>

35
00:01:47.911 --> 00:01:48.744
<v Speaker 1>his time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the sovereign then ruled by a king </v>

36
00:01:50.401 --> 00:01:51.234
<v Speaker 1>or prince was derived from God and </v>
<v Speaker 1>political thinkers for the next two </v>

37
00:01:54.031 --> 00:01:54.864
<v Speaker 1>centuries continue to find the source of</v>
<v Speaker 1>sovereignty and divine right or in the </v>

38
00:01:57.811 --> 00:02:00.450
<v Speaker 1>laws of nature or social contracts.</v>

39
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:01.463
<v Speaker 1>But by the end of the 18th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a revolutionary new idea came to the </v>

40
00:02:04.711 --> 00:02:05.544
<v Speaker 1>fore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It said that the source of sovereignty </v>

41
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.883
<v Speaker 1>lay not in the man upstairs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the many men and later women </v>

42
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.960
<v Speaker 1>downstairs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

43
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.430
<v Speaker 1>the source of sovereignty was in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

44
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.313
<v Speaker 1>You see it loud and clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the very first line of the </v>

45
00:02:17.731 --> 00:02:20.580
<v Speaker 1>declaration of independence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when in the course of human events,</v>

46
00:02:20.581 --> 00:02:24.210
<v Speaker 1>it becomes necessary for one people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>dissolve the political bands,</v>

47
00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.080
<v Speaker 1>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Etc.</v>

48
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.640
<v Speaker 1>OnE people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

49
00:02:26.641 --> 00:02:27.474
<v Speaker 1>one nation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By this time the word nation had become </v>

50
00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.420
<v Speaker 1>synonymous with the word people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here you have a state which finds the</v>

51
00:02:33.421 --> 00:02:34.254
<v Speaker 1>justification for its sovereign power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the monopoly on all the violence that </v>

52
00:02:37.681 --> 00:02:40.620
<v Speaker 1>happens within its borders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the consent of the people,</v>

53
00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.290
<v Speaker 1>the nation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hence nation state.</v>

54
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.200
<v Speaker 1>The questiOn becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you define a people?</v>

55
00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:47.423
<v Speaker 1>What makes people a people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a number of problematic nation </v>

56
00:02:50.401 --> 00:02:51.234
<v Speaker 1>states in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>places couched in what seems like </v>

57
00:02:53.131 --> 00:02:55.380
<v Speaker 1>unceasing violence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to understand them,</v>

58
00:02:55.381 --> 00:02:59.380
<v Speaker 1>we must first understand how people </v>
<v Speaker 1>develop a national identity.</v>

59
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.030
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are a number of thIngs that groups</v>

60
00:03:01.031 --> 00:03:03.610
<v Speaker 1>can share.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A language race or religion,</v>

61
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.270
<v Speaker 1>but stronger than all of these is as </v>
<v Speaker 1>John Stuart mill,</v>

62
00:03:07.271 --> 00:03:10.990
<v Speaker 1>the great liberal thinker said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and identity of political antecedents,</v>

63
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.470
<v Speaker 1>a possession of a national history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a community of recollections,</v>

64
00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:15.423
<v Speaker 1>collective pride and humiliation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pleasure and regret connected with the </v>

65
00:03:18.191 --> 00:03:21.130
<v Speaker 1>same incidents in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A historical narrative,</v>

66
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.053
<v Speaker 1>a national memory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This binds people closer together than </v>

67
00:03:24.251 --> 00:03:26.710
<v Speaker 1>any other common trait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>

68
00:03:26.711 --> 00:03:27.544
<v Speaker 1>and as we know too well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the many millions of people who find </v>

69
00:03:29.891 --> 00:03:33.340
<v Speaker 1>themselves in a state very often don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have the same memory.</v>

70
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:34.593
<v Speaker 1>Narratives diverged or rewritten mixed </v>
<v Speaker 1>with myth and fiction as the years and </v>

71
00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:39.550
<v Speaker 1>decades pile on.</v>

72
00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.780
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden you have one state with </v>
<v Speaker 1>two people or three peoples,</v>

73
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.930
<v Speaker 1>and the proBlem grows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It took 400 years and a lot of blood for</v>

74
00:03:46.931 --> 00:03:50.890
<v Speaker 1>the island of Ireland to resolve issues </v>
<v Speaker 1>between nation and state.</v>

75
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.060
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Catholic,</v>

76
00:03:52.061 --> 00:03:56.380
<v Speaker 1>irish and protestant irish have very </v>
<v Speaker 1>different memories of a national history</v>

77
00:03:56.381 --> 00:03:59.410
<v Speaker 1>full of conquest and subjugation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In 1921,</v>

78
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:00.363
<v Speaker 1>the largely catholic southern part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the island declared itself independent </v>

79
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.130
<v Speaker 1>from britain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>the protestants being largely of british</v>

80
00:04:06.131 --> 00:04:09.640
<v Speaker 1>descent and who held power in the north </v>
<v Speaker 1>had no desire to break from the uk,</v>

81
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.320
<v Speaker 1>so a partition was built separating the </v>
<v Speaker 1>irish free state from north Ireland.</v>

82
00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:15.460
<v Speaker 1>Good solution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

83
00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:16.413
<v Speaker 1>Keep the warring factions apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only problem is that the catholic </v>

84
00:04:19.131 --> 00:04:22.420
<v Speaker 1>still in north Ireland became an ill </v>
<v Speaker 1>treated minority.</v>

85
00:04:22.421 --> 00:04:23.254
<v Speaker 1>Here's a map showing the distribution of</v>
<v Speaker 1>catholics and protestants in northern </v>

86
00:04:25.841 --> 00:04:28.360
<v Speaker 1>Ireland doesn't really suit straight </v>
<v Speaker 1>lines on a map,</v>

87
00:04:28.361 --> 00:04:28.690
<v Speaker 1>does it?</v>

88
00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:29.523
<v Speaker 1>Fortunately in 2007,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the irish troubles were settled </v>

89
00:04:31.481 --> 00:04:32.500
<v Speaker 1>peacefully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

90
00:04:32.501 --> 00:04:34.960
<v Speaker 1>this kind of conclusion isn't really the</v>
<v Speaker 1>norm,</v>

91
00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:36.820
<v Speaker 1>though there is a partition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

92
00:04:36.821 --> 00:04:37.654
<v Speaker 1>on the island of Cyprus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the northern turkish cypriots and the </v>

93
00:04:39.641 --> 00:04:40.474
<v Speaker 1>southern greek cypriots haven't yet come</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the same conclusion because the </v>

94
00:04:43.961 --> 00:04:46.780
<v Speaker 1>issues of nation and state there haven't</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet been resolved,</v>

95
00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.390
<v Speaker 1>nor have they been resolved for kurdish </v>
<v Speaker 1>muslims,</v>

96
00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:50.283
<v Speaker 1>the largest single group of people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world who don't have a state of </v>

97
00:04:52.781 --> 00:04:53.614
<v Speaker 1>their own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we know of course that many kurds </v>

98
00:04:55.301 --> 00:04:56.860
<v Speaker 1>live in the northern part of Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but few,</v>

99
00:04:56.861 --> 00:04:59.560
<v Speaker 1>if any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>identify themselves as iraqi.</v>

100
00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:00.403
<v Speaker 1>The example that we're perhaps most </v>
<v Speaker 1>familiar with is that of Israel and </v>

101
00:05:02.801 --> 00:05:05.620
<v Speaker 1>palestine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know the hiStory and we know how each</v>

102
00:05:05.621 --> 00:05:08.980
<v Speaker 1>party writes the narrative and who's to </v>
<v Speaker 1>say which is right.</v>

103
00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.903
<v Speaker 1>Just last saturday was landed and annual</v>
<v Speaker 1>day of palestinian protest for an event </v>

104
00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:14.463
<v Speaker 1>in 1976 in which the israeli government </v>
<v Speaker 1>plan to expropriate thousands of </v>

105
00:05:18.221 --> 00:05:21.400
<v Speaker 1>palestinian demands for security and </v>
<v Speaker 1>settlement purposes.</v>

106
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.110
<v Speaker 1>One protester was killed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more,</v>

107
00:05:23.111 --> 00:05:23.944
<v Speaker 1>were injured and sent to hospitals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are the remedies when you have to </v>

108
00:05:26.411 --> 00:05:30.240
<v Speaker 1>peoples living in a territory to which </v>
<v Speaker 1>both can lay claim territories which are</v>

109
00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.930
<v Speaker 1>part of their history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their family history.</v>

110
00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.180
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can have external forces come in and</v>

111
00:05:34.181 --> 00:05:37.840
<v Speaker 1>try to referee the situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we've seen from firsthand experience</v>

112
00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:38.853
<v Speaker 1>how imperfect such illusions can be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about partitions like in Ireland or </v>

113
00:05:42.461 --> 00:05:43.900
<v Speaker 1>Cyprus?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Difficulty is.</v>

114
00:05:43.901 --> 00:05:45.880
<v Speaker 1>There's always gonna be people on both </v>
<v Speaker 1>sides.</v>

115
00:05:45.881 --> 00:05:49.780
<v Speaker 1>We think the partition is unfair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about population movement?</v>

116
00:05:49.781 --> 00:05:53.830
<v Speaker 1>It kind of ethnic cleansing where one </v>
<v Speaker 1>people has to move to another place.</v>

117
00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:56.890
<v Speaker 1>It's a solution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but an extremely painful one,</v>

118
00:05:56.891 --> 00:05:59.510
<v Speaker 1>which who are forced to move,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lose everything.</v>

119
00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:01.670
<v Speaker 1>All of these remedies are not lightly </v>
<v Speaker 1>taken,</v>

120
00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.760
<v Speaker 1>but the sad truth is that they are often</v>
<v Speaker 1>better than the alternative,</v>

121
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:08.510
<v Speaker 1>which is endemic violence that feeds on </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

122
00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:09.583
<v Speaker 1>Lessons here are feeble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe this is the most important </v>

123
00:06:11.661 --> 00:06:14.000
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Violence of this kind produces precisely</v>

124
00:06:14.001 --> 00:06:16.760
<v Speaker 1>those experiences which pass into </v>
<v Speaker 1>history,</v>

125
00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:17.713
<v Speaker 1>confirming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strengthening the identity of both </v>

126
00:06:19.311 --> 00:06:20.144
<v Speaker 1>sides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Worse violence of this kind produces </v>

127
00:06:21.441 --> 00:06:23.540
<v Speaker 1>people with a stake in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Continuing,</v>

128
00:06:23.541 --> 00:06:27.140
<v Speaker 1>namely young men to whom such civil war </v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes a way of life,</v>

129
00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:29.240
<v Speaker 1>providing a source of employment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>excitement,</v>

130
00:06:29.241 --> 00:06:30.800
<v Speaker 1>adventure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and most importantly,</v>

131
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:33.050
<v Speaker 1>purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sovereignty is a problematic thing.</v>

132
00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:35.750
<v Speaker 1>It can often produce deeply depressing </v>
<v Speaker 1>results,</v>

133
00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:38.780
<v Speaker 1>but if there's one thing that we can do </v>
<v Speaker 1>as an international community,</v>

134
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:39.703
<v Speaker 1>it's to try to understand the history </v>
<v Speaker 1>and example of such cases to try to </v>

135
00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:44.113
<v Speaker 1>foresee and prevent new antagonisms </v>
<v Speaker 1>before the violence that consumes them </v>

136
00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.080
<v Speaker 1>becomes a self generating monster.</v>

137
00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:00.320
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

138
00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.160
<v Speaker 1>you actually mentioned the manage to </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep most of them in.</v>
