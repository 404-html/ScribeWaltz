00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:03.323
<v Speaker 1>Let's have some fun with physics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as I finish writing this short </v>

2
00:00:07.921 --> 00:00:08.754
<v Speaker 1>piece of text,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to delete the document that </v>

3
00:00:10.531 --> 00:00:12.810
<v Speaker 1>contains it from my computer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question is,</v>

4
00:00:12.811 --> 00:00:17.340
<v Speaker 1>when I erase these 320,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>bits of information,</v>

5
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:18.743
<v Speaker 1>where do they go?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thermodynamics tells us that matter and </v>

6
00:00:20.731 --> 00:00:24.000
<v Speaker 1>energy can never be destroyed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only transferred.</v>

7
00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:25.003
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this goes for information to when I </v>

8
00:00:26.341 --> 00:00:27.174
<v Speaker 1>erase something from my computer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not destroyed but transferred into </v>

9
00:00:31.201 --> 00:00:33.810
<v Speaker 1>heat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why laptops get hot.</v>

10
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.450
<v Speaker 1>That's why computers need fans to cool </v>
<v Speaker 1>them down.</v>

11
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.210
<v Speaker 1>This law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the information can never be destroyed,</v>

12
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.710
<v Speaker 1>holds true everywhere in the universe </v>
<v Speaker 1>except one place.</v>

13
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:44.903
<v Speaker 1>Black hole in the 19 seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steven Hawking showed us that black </v>

14
00:00:47.581 --> 00:00:51.980
<v Speaker 1>holes actually radiate super hot energy </v>
<v Speaker 1>from their event horizons.</v>

15
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.860
<v Speaker 1>The place where everything even light is</v>
<v Speaker 1>irrevocably do.</v>

16
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.933
<v Speaker 1>This meant crucially that black holes </v>
<v Speaker 1>get smaller and smaller and evaporate </v>

17
00:01:00.991 --> 00:01:04.110
<v Speaker 1>over time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually disappearing altogether.</v>

18
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.320
<v Speaker 1>This is like the universe erasing its </v>
<v Speaker 1>own word document,</v>

19
00:01:07.321 --> 00:01:10.530
<v Speaker 1>except for what we've already said can </v>
<v Speaker 1>never be destroyed.</v>

20
00:01:10.531 --> 00:01:15.531
<v Speaker 1>Information looks like here actually is </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the information paradox was born.</v>

21
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.400
<v Speaker 1>Scientists have a love hate relationship</v>
<v Speaker 1>with paradoxes over the years.</v>

22
00:01:20.401 --> 00:01:24.480
<v Speaker 1>Many have tried to solve the information</v>
<v Speaker 1>paradox and we'll talk about a few here,</v>

23
00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:25.543
<v Speaker 1>but first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jacob Bekenstein knowing that he could </v>

24
00:01:27.511 --> 00:01:28.344
<v Speaker 1>never actually read the information </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside a black hole Bekenstein resolve </v>

25
00:01:31.951 --> 00:01:36.510
<v Speaker 1>to figure out how much hidden </v>
<v Speaker 1>information otherwise known as entropy.</v>

26
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.060
<v Speaker 1>A given black hole actually contained.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

27
00:01:39.061 --> 00:01:39.894
<v Speaker 1>you'd imagine that the amount of entropy</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a black hole would equal the volume </v>

28
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.903
<v Speaker 1>of that black hole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the amount of coffee in a coffee </v>

29
00:01:47.521 --> 00:01:52.521
<v Speaker 1>mug equals the volume of that Mug,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Bekenstein found that in the case of</v>

30
00:01:52.621 --> 00:01:53.454
<v Speaker 1>black holes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the amount of hidden information inside </v>

31
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.873
<v Speaker 1>is not equal to the volume,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the area of the event horizons </v>

32
00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.070
<v Speaker 1>surface.</v>

33
00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.963
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means that when inflammation </v>

34
00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:08.250
<v Speaker 1>approaches a black hole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gets plastered onto the event horizon</v>

35
00:02:08.251 --> 00:02:11.430
<v Speaker 1>surface,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like dots on a super hot basketball,</v>

36
00:02:11.431 --> 00:02:12.264
<v Speaker 1>but there's a problem here and I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's time to bring matthew mcconaughey </v>

37
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.700
<v Speaker 1>into the equation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the end of the movie,</v>

38
00:02:17.701 --> 00:02:18.534
<v Speaker 1>interstellar spoilers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Matthew mcconaughey goes into a black </v>

39
00:02:21.811 --> 00:02:25.590
<v Speaker 1>hole when he hits the event horizon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He seems to be fine.</v>

40
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.200
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing really surprising about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

41
00:02:28.201 --> 00:02:29.034
<v Speaker 1>We know that eventually mcconaughey is </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to get ripped to shreds by the </v>

42
00:02:31.921 --> 00:02:32.754
<v Speaker 1>intense gravity of the black hole </v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually being smushed into the </v>

43
00:02:35.851 --> 00:02:36.684
<v Speaker 1>singularity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we sort of know that when you cross </v>

44
00:02:39.031 --> 00:02:43.800
<v Speaker 1>the event horizon of a large black hole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you probably wouldn't feel anything like</v>

45
00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:44.693
<v Speaker 1>the film shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how does this square with what we </v>

46
00:02:46.261 --> 00:02:49.170
<v Speaker 1>just said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that all information approaching a black</v>

47
00:02:49.171 --> 00:02:52.710
<v Speaker 1>hole gets hot glue gunned to its event </v>
<v Speaker 1>horizon.</v>

48
00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:53.880
<v Speaker 1>The answer is here.</v>

49
00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:54.713
<v Speaker 1>This is a stereogram.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might remember them from grade </v>

50
00:02:56.881 --> 00:02:57.714
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A Two d image that when looked at for </v>

51
00:02:59.441 --> 00:03:03.550
<v Speaker 1>long enough reveals a hidden picture </v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems to rise off the plane,</v>

52
00:03:03.551 --> 00:03:04.384
<v Speaker 1>otherwise known as a Hologram.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Notice that the three d info appears </v>

53
00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:08.643
<v Speaker 1>highly scrambled into Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what's happening to Matthew </v>

54
00:03:11.501 --> 00:03:12.334
<v Speaker 1>mcconaughey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What he travels past the event horizon </v>

55
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.980
<v Speaker 1>of a black hole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything that happens inside the black</v>

56
00:03:17.981 --> 00:03:18.814
<v Speaker 1>hole is essentially a hologram of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>information encoded on it's two d </v>

57
00:03:23.561 --> 00:03:27.340
<v Speaker 1>surface mcconaughey would move past the </v>
<v Speaker 1>event horizon feeling alright?</v>

58
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.833
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alright.</v>

59
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:29.673
<v Speaker 1>But an observer from outside would see </v>
<v Speaker 1>him incinerated and spread across the </v>

60
00:03:33.371 --> 00:03:34.204
<v Speaker 1>surface as particles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The crazy thing is that both </v>

61
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.510
<v Speaker 1>perspectives would be correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>According to physicists,</v>

62
00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:40.363
<v Speaker 1>Leonard Susskind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this may be the case for the entire </v>

63
00:03:42.641 --> 00:03:43.474
<v Speaker 1>universe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the three dimensional space we live in </v>

64
00:03:45.641 --> 00:03:50.560
<v Speaker 1>and moving every everyday may be in </v>
<v Speaker 1>effect a Hologram of a lower dimensional</v>

65
00:03:50.561 --> 00:03:51.040
<v Speaker 1>universe.</v>

66
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.873
<v Speaker 1>I'll be it a perfect holiday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is called the holographic </v>

67
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:55.203
<v Speaker 1>principle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean that the universe is a </v>

68
00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.630
<v Speaker 1>dream or an illusion or anything like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

69
00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.973
<v Speaker 1>but it is as genuinely revolutionary and</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea as relativity was to Tony and </v>

70
00:04:04.931 --> 00:04:07.000
<v Speaker 1>physics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know why it works,</v>

71
00:04:07.001 --> 00:04:07.834
<v Speaker 1>but every time we try to quantify the </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of information in an enclosed </v>

72
00:04:11.861 --> 00:04:15.880
<v Speaker 1>space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's always equal to the surface area of</v>

73
00:04:15.881 --> 00:04:16.714
<v Speaker 1>that space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it just goes to show that once </v>

74
00:04:18.461 --> 00:04:19.294
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the universe is not intuitive to the </v>

75
00:04:21.551 --> 00:04:25.000
<v Speaker 1>human mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean once again,</v>

76
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:27.430
<v Speaker 1>we can't figure it out.</v>

77
00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.830
<v Speaker 1>Hey everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thanks for watching and thank you to the</v>

78
00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:37.673
<v Speaker 1>patriotic patrons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those 64 of you out there and I was </v>

79
00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.100
<v Speaker 1>bowled over by the support for this </v>
<v Speaker 1>channel.</v>

80
00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.670
<v Speaker 1>You can all consider yourself as part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a special nerd writer club now,</v>

81
00:04:46.671 --> 00:04:49.340
<v Speaker 1>and I have a lot of really cool things </v>
<v Speaker 1>planned for you.</v>

82
00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:50.203
<v Speaker 1>Google hangouts treats you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've known you've no idea it's going </v>

83
00:04:52.701 --> 00:04:53.534
<v Speaker 1>to be fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

84
00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:54.463
<v Speaker 1>first things first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to collect all of your emails </v>

85
00:04:55.691 --> 00:04:58.290
<v Speaker 1>so that I can send out a weekly or </v>
<v Speaker 1>biweekly newsletter,</v>

86
00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.870
<v Speaker 1>the Patriot on patrons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

87
00:04:59.871 --> 00:05:01.340
<v Speaker 1>where you can hear about what's going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>come up.</v>

88
00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.100
<v Speaker 1>If you want to be a patriot patron for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the nerd writer,</v>

89
00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.710
<v Speaker 1>you can pledge as little as $1 to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>channel.</v>

90
00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.570
<v Speaker 1>If you pledge a little bit more like $5,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could get a special nerd writer mug.</v>

91
00:05:11.571 --> 00:05:13.010
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was.</v>

92
00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.500
<v Speaker 1>I was so pumped when these came and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have no idea.</v>

93
00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:17.690
<v Speaker 1>There's only one left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if there's a demand,</v>

94
00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.840
<v Speaker 1>I'll definitely order more and get more </v>
<v Speaker 1>swag and things like that.</v>

95
00:05:20.841 --> 00:05:22.090
<v Speaker 1>And it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

96
00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:23.060
<v Speaker 1>it's just great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As always,</v>

97
00:05:23.061 --> 00:05:25.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be in comments talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the holographic principle.</v>

98
00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.310
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for watching again and I'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>see you next time.</v>
