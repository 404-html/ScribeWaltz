00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:22.443
<v Speaker 1>It's tempting to think of the ocean as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>domain of quiet or Jacques Cousteau </v>

2
00:00:27.611 --> 00:00:30.100
<v Speaker 1>himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>called it the silent world,</v>

3
00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.810
<v Speaker 1>but in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sea is full of noise.</v>

4
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:39.880
<v Speaker 1>Sea Mammals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crustaceans,</v>

5
00:00:39.881 --> 00:00:40.714
<v Speaker 1>diving birds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a number of fish communicate with </v>

6
00:00:42.521 --> 00:00:44.110
<v Speaker 1>pulses of sound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dolphins,</v>

7
00:00:44.111 --> 00:00:44.944
<v Speaker 1>as we all know from the modern cinematic</v>
<v Speaker 1>masterpiece flipper use echolocation </v>

8
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.273
<v Speaker 1>Dolphin's sonar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you flipped her sense of of sound </v>

9
00:00:52.781 --> 00:00:56.500
<v Speaker 1>toward an object and receives an echo </v>
<v Speaker 1>back he can see in total darkness.</v>

10
00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:58.413
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about 20 million years after Dolphins </v>

11
00:01:00.431 --> 00:01:01.264
<v Speaker 1>mastered echolocation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It occurred to human beings that the </v>

12
00:01:03.401 --> 00:01:04.234
<v Speaker 1>skill might have some use when a young </v>
<v Speaker 1>man named Leonardo dicaprio drowned </v>

13
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.740
<v Speaker 1>needlessly in the ocean following an </v>
<v Speaker 1>unfortunate incident with the ship.</v>

14
00:01:11.741 --> 00:01:16.741
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember the name of sonar or </v>
<v Speaker 1>sound navigation and ranging is only one</v>

15
00:01:16.751 --> 00:01:17.584
<v Speaker 1>of the ways that human beings have </v>
<v Speaker 1>doubled noise levels in the ocean every </v>

16
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:21.753
<v Speaker 1>decade since the mid 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was once the exclusive domain of </v>

17
00:01:23.921 --> 00:01:27.070
<v Speaker 1>clicks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wines and whale songs is now throng with</v>

18
00:01:27.071 --> 00:01:27.904
<v Speaker 1>the thunder of ship propellers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ultra loud naval sonar and seismic </v>

19
00:01:31.181 --> 00:01:35.560
<v Speaker 1>surveys of oil and gas companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which blast air guns so loud,</v>

20
00:01:35.561 --> 00:01:36.394
<v Speaker 1>they penetrate kilometers into the ocean</v>
<v Speaker 1>floor so loud that they are a million </v>

21
00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.870
<v Speaker 1>times more intense than that.</v>

22
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:43.733
<v Speaker 2>Sounds good.</v>

23
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.700
<v Speaker 1>The effect of such deafening noise is </v>
<v Speaker 1>devastating to the oceans ecosystem,</v>

24
00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:50.683
<v Speaker 1>and by extension the world's at large.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is particularly destructive to Wales </v>

25
00:01:54.291 --> 00:01:58.160
<v Speaker 1>who use low frequency noises to </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate across large distances,</v>

26
00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:59.263
<v Speaker 1>trapped in that disorienting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could Kaufmanni whales swim dive </v>

27
00:02:01.951 --> 00:02:04.130
<v Speaker 1>erratically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>radically causing decompression sickness</v>

28
00:02:04.131 --> 00:02:04.964
<v Speaker 1>and mass strandings on nearby beaches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In July of this year of the Obama </v>

29
00:02:07.251 --> 00:02:08.084
<v Speaker 1>administration authorized Seismic Aragon</v>
<v Speaker 1>testing for an unprecedented swath of </v>

30
00:02:12.141 --> 00:02:12.974
<v Speaker 1>the Atlantic Ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something that government itself </v>

31
00:02:14.301 --> 00:02:17.420
<v Speaker 1>determined would injure more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>138,000</v>

32
00:02:17.421 --> 00:02:20.870
<v Speaker 1>dolphins and whales,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including the North Atlantic right whale</v>

33
00:02:20.871 --> 00:02:24.860
<v Speaker 1>of which and where there are only a </v>
<v Speaker 1>meager 500 left.</v>

34
00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.843
<v Speaker 1>My charity for the 2014 project for </v>
<v Speaker 1>awesome is the largest international </v>

35
00:02:30.111 --> 00:02:33.830
<v Speaker 1>advocacy organization focused solely on </v>
<v Speaker 1>ocean conservation.</v>

36
00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.840
<v Speaker 1>They have the resources,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the coordination,</v>

37
00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.853
<v Speaker 1>and a laundry list of victories against </v>
<v Speaker 1>the admittedly huge interests that </v>

38
00:02:40.131 --> 00:02:42.740
<v Speaker 1>degrade RC everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

39
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:43.663
<v Speaker 1>100 years ago we had no fear that what </v>
<v Speaker 1>we did could affect the vastness of the </v>

40
00:02:47.721 --> 00:02:51.530
<v Speaker 1>ocean than a few of our bravest went up </v>
<v Speaker 1>into space and the pictures they took,</v>

41
00:02:51.531 --> 00:02:52.364
<v Speaker 1>their gave us an urgent new perspective </v>
<v Speaker 1>helping us to see that the world which </v>

42
00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.550
<v Speaker 1>made us could buy us the unmet.</v>
