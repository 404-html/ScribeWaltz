1
00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:13.963
<v Speaker 1>Today I want to take a little bit of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>closer look at a scene from Alfred </v>

2
00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:17.443
<v Speaker 1>Hitchcock's masterpiece vertigo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an early scene in the movie when </v>

3
00:00:20.121 --> 00:00:20.954
<v Speaker 1>the retired detective Scotty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>played by Jimmy Stewart visits an old </v>

4
00:00:23.601 --> 00:00:25.560
<v Speaker 1>college friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gavin elster.</v>

5
00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:28.573
<v Speaker 1>Specifically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to look at how hitchcock blocks </v>

6
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:35.770
<v Speaker 1>this five minute and 22nd scene and how </v>
<v Speaker 1>is staging of the characters adds to the</v>

7
00:00:36.021 --> 00:00:36.854
<v Speaker 1>story I married into it now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should say that there are two ways to </v>

8
00:00:39.561 --> 00:00:40.394
<v Speaker 1>look at the scene from the perspective </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a first time viewer who has to take </v>

9
00:00:42.981 --> 00:00:47.030
<v Speaker 1>the information it presents at face </v>
<v Speaker 1>value or from the perspective of someone</v>

10
00:00:47.031 --> 00:00:47.864
<v Speaker 1>who's already seen the film and knows </v>
<v Speaker 1>the true intentions and outcomes of </v>

11
00:00:50.961 --> 00:00:51.794
<v Speaker 1>what's revealed here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to take a look at this from </v>

12
00:00:53.421 --> 00:00:54.254
<v Speaker 1>the second perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means that there's going to be </v>

13
00:00:55.311 --> 00:00:56.930
<v Speaker 1>spoilers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so just a heads up,</v>

14
00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.280
<v Speaker 1>so if you've seen vertigo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that in this scene Gavin elster</v>

15
00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:02.143
<v Speaker 1>is spinning and elaborate lie in order </v>
<v Speaker 1>to create an alibi so that he can get </v>

16
00:01:06.021 --> 00:01:09.110
<v Speaker 1>away with murdering his wife and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>plan.</v>

17
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.973
<v Speaker 1>Scotty is the alibi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gavin tell Scotty that his wife has </v>

18
00:01:13.521 --> 00:01:17.270
<v Speaker 1>possessed by an old spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ask Scotty to spy on her,</v>

19
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.433
<v Speaker 1>then switches his wife out for an </v>
<v Speaker 1>actress who plays that part cleverly </v>

20
00:01:21.831 --> 00:01:24.650
<v Speaker 1>exploiting Scotty's desire and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>vertigo,</v>

21
00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.580
<v Speaker 1>Gavin and the actress murder his wife </v>
<v Speaker 1>and leave Scotty traumatized,</v>

22
00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:29.230
<v Speaker 1>believing that</v>

23
00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:30.550
<v Speaker 2>the wife committed suicide.</v>

24
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:34.813
<v Speaker 1>The scene in question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one in Gavin's office at his ship </v>

25
00:01:36.701 --> 00:01:37.534
<v Speaker 1>building business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes only 11 minutes into the film and </v>

26
00:01:39.921 --> 00:01:43.880
<v Speaker 1>comprises Gavin's attempt to learn </v>
<v Speaker 1>Scotty into his deception.</v>

27
00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.580
<v Speaker 2>How did you get in the shipbuilding </v>
<v Speaker 2>business?</v>

28
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.633
<v Speaker 2>I'm married.</v>

29
00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:49.773
<v Speaker 1>The scene starts with Gavin seated at </v>
<v Speaker 1>his desk and Scotty standing behind a </v>

30
00:01:53.141 --> 00:01:55.450
<v Speaker 1>chair in the center of the room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the beginning,</v>

31
00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.313
<v Speaker 1>it's Scotty who's dominant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's asking questions moving around </v>

32
00:01:59.231 --> 00:02:00.064
<v Speaker 1>Gavin's desk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leisurely inspecting various objects </v>

33
00:02:02.531 --> 00:02:03.364
<v Speaker 1>like a retired detective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mike by acting and sitting rather coyly </v>

34
00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.540
<v Speaker 1>Gavin lures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scotty into his space and his confidence</v>

35
00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.460
<v Speaker 1>under the illusion of sincerity.</v>

36
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.450
<v Speaker 2>What was it like to hear?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How long have you been back?</v>

37
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.273
<v Speaker 2>Almost a year,</v>

38
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:18.323
<v Speaker 1>Scotty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He continues his inspection moving to </v>

39
00:02:19.631 --> 00:02:22.810
<v Speaker 1>the other side of the room to see an old</v>
<v Speaker 1>picture of San Francisco.</v>

40
00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.350
<v Speaker 1>His back is turned just as Gavin makes a</v>
<v Speaker 1>key confession.</v>

41
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.840
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would like to live here.</v>

42
00:02:27.841 --> 00:02:32.841
<v Speaker 2>Then kinda excitement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A freedom.</v>

43
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:34.043
<v Speaker 1>It's that freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He desires freedom from his wife that's </v>

44
00:02:36.451 --> 00:02:37.284
<v Speaker 1>launching this cruel plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course the audience can't know it </v>

45
00:02:40.021 --> 00:02:41.790
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but hitchcock's foreshadowing.</v>

46
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.970
<v Speaker 1>It's there and it's in the staging to </v>
<v Speaker 1>while he sits.</v>

47
00:02:44.971 --> 00:02:45.804
<v Speaker 1>Gavin is in front of a window that shows</v>
<v Speaker 1>a shit behind being put together piece </v>

48
00:02:49.561 --> 00:02:50.394
<v Speaker 1>by piece,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not unlike the story he's about to spin </v>

49
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.620
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scotty.</v>

50
00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.370
<v Speaker 2>Would you like a drink now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

51
00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A little early in the day for me.</v>

52
00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:00.503
<v Speaker 1>Scotty moves toward Gavin again and sits</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the center chair asking him the </v>

53
00:03:04.261 --> 00:03:08.370
<v Speaker 1>purpose of their meeting and hear the </v>
<v Speaker 1>power changes hands.</v>

54
00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:09.383
<v Speaker 1>As Scotty sits in the hot seat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gavin stands and begins to tell his </v>

55
00:03:13.591 --> 00:03:16.620
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He moves around the desk and up a couple</v>

56
00:03:16.621 --> 00:03:19.470
<v Speaker 1>of stairs so that he's towering over </v>
<v Speaker 1>Scotty even higher.</v>

57
00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.230
<v Speaker 2>I want you to follow my wife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

58
00:03:22.231 --> 00:03:24.720
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were very happily married.</v>

59
00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.450
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm afraid to sound harsh.</v>

60
00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.080
<v Speaker 2>May come to someone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did.</v>

61
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.890
<v Speaker 1>When Gavin makes his big reveal that his</v>
<v Speaker 1>wife is being supernaturally possessed,</v>

62
00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.873
<v Speaker 1>hitchcock brings them in closer to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Scotty so that the ankle is even more </v>

63
00:03:39.581 --> 00:03:40.414
<v Speaker 1>extreme far now from being coy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gavin's blocking becomes aggressive and </v>

64
00:03:44.231 --> 00:03:45.064
<v Speaker 1>the next thing that happens is perhaps </v>
<v Speaker 1>the most interesting moment in the </v>

65
00:03:47.471 --> 00:03:48.304
<v Speaker 1>scene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kevin and Scotty remain fixed in their </v>

66
00:03:50.231 --> 00:03:51.064
<v Speaker 1>positions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the camera dollies backwards to </v>

67
00:03:53.651 --> 00:03:57.400
<v Speaker 1>bring them both into frame.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the camera moves all over the scene,</v>

68
00:03:57.401 --> 00:04:01.150
<v Speaker 1>but this movement is the only that </v>
<v Speaker 1>really calls attention to itself.</v>

69
00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:02.383
<v Speaker 1>This is a reminder that for hitchcock </v>
<v Speaker 1>blocking involves the position of the </v>

70
00:04:05.441 --> 00:04:08.260
<v Speaker 1>camera too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are three elements in this scene,</v>

71
00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.430
<v Speaker 1>not just to Scotty expresses his </v>
<v Speaker 1>disbelief at the situation,</v>

72
00:04:12.431 --> 00:04:15.190
<v Speaker 1>and Gavin sitting again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>softer in tone,</v>

73
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.780
<v Speaker 1>acts like he understands.</v>

74
00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:18.480
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasted your time.</v>

75
00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:20.670
<v Speaker 2>Thanks for coming in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Scotty.</v>

76
00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:21.603
<v Speaker 1>Scotty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he gets up and moves toward the door to </v>

77
00:04:23.231 --> 00:04:24.064
<v Speaker 1>leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gavin lets this happen because he knows </v>

78
00:04:25.571 --> 00:04:27.580
<v Speaker 1>that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really Rope Scotty and he has to make it</v>

79
00:04:27.581 --> 00:04:28.414
<v Speaker 1>seem like it's his own choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scotty apologizes and Gavin moves into </v>

80
00:04:32.201 --> 00:04:34.900
<v Speaker 1>his space again and before Scotty can </v>
<v Speaker 1>say anything,</v>

81
00:04:34.901 --> 00:04:37.600
<v Speaker 1>Gavin starts in on the details of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

82
00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.810
<v Speaker 1>how his wife seems to fade in and out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>her personality,</v>

83
00:04:40.811 --> 00:04:45.811
<v Speaker 1>how she wanders around to odd places and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gavin himself is wandering in the second</v>

84
00:04:45.971 --> 00:04:46.804
<v Speaker 1>room which is raised a few steps like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>stage and Scotty moves to the chair on </v>

85
00:04:51.281 --> 00:04:54.330
<v Speaker 1>the opposite side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like an audience member watching</v>

86
00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:55.243
<v Speaker 2>his performance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've followed her one day wash check </v>

87
00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.150
<v Speaker 2>coming out of the apartment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went,</v>

88
00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:03.600
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know even walked a different </v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

89
00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.790
<v Speaker 2>Got into her car and drove out to golden</v>
<v Speaker 2>gate park.</v>

90
00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:12.840
<v Speaker 2>Five months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sat by the lake,</v>

91
00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.550
<v Speaker 2>staring across the water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pillows,</v>

92
00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.160
<v Speaker 2>the stand on the shore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

93
00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.570
<v Speaker 2>portals of the past.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there a long time without moving?</v>

94
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.630
<v Speaker 2>I had to leave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get back to the office.</v>

95
00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.200
<v Speaker 2>When I got home that evening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I asked her what she'd done all day.</v>

96
00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:32.520
<v Speaker 2>She said she did not have to golden gate</v>
<v Speaker 2>park and sat by the lake.</v>

97
00:05:32.521 --> 00:05:37.521
<v Speaker 2>That's a speedometer on her car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She that she drove 94 months.</v>

98
00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:41.983
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what Gavin is doing here isn't </v>

99
00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:44.263
<v Speaker 1>recounting details,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but planting them in Scotty's head </v>

100
00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:47.473
<v Speaker 1>details that will match with his </v>
<v Speaker 1>actresses actions in the following </v>

101
00:05:50.121 --> 00:05:50.954
<v Speaker 1>scenes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This layer of stage performance is a </v>

102
00:05:53.361 --> 00:05:56.570
<v Speaker 1>stroke of genius on Hitchcock's part </v>
<v Speaker 1>because on one level,</v>

103
00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:00.980
<v Speaker 1>vertigo is about the power of film and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the power of narrative,</v>

104
00:06:00.981 --> 00:06:04.160
<v Speaker 1>how a really good narrative can </v>
<v Speaker 1>manipulate us,</v>

105
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:05.023
<v Speaker 1>whether it's for the purposes of </v>
<v Speaker 1>entertainment or something more </v>

106
00:06:07.131 --> 00:06:07.964
<v Speaker 1>sinister.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The narrative laid out for Scotty in </v>

107
00:06:09.741 --> 00:06:12.260
<v Speaker 1>this scene will drive the whole rest of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the story.</v>

108
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.153
<v Speaker 1>It'll drive Scotty's actions in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first part of the film and eventually </v>

109
00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:20.950
<v Speaker 1>it'll drive his own obsessive narrative </v>
<v Speaker 1>creation and the second part I've got to</v>

110
00:06:20.951 --> 00:06:21.784
<v Speaker 1>know this guy where she goes and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>she does before I get involved with </v>

111
00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:25.403
<v Speaker 1>doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talked to the doctors at all are </v>

112
00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:28.673
<v Speaker 1>carefully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When Gavin steps back down into the </v>

113
00:06:30.661 --> 00:06:31.494
<v Speaker 1>lower room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the monologue ends and the conversation </v>

114
00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:34.863
<v Speaker 1>resumed.</v>

115
00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:38.580
<v Speaker 1>Scotty gets up from the chair to protest</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gavin's request for help,</v>

116
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:39.833
<v Speaker 1>but he's moving toward him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gavin mirrors his movement and </v>

117
00:06:42.061 --> 00:06:44.280
<v Speaker 1>approaches Scotty entering his space </v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

118
00:06:44.281 --> 00:06:47.430
<v Speaker 1>This time with his final barking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a simple request.</v>

119
00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:50.470
<v Speaker 1>We're going to an opening of the opera </v>
<v Speaker 1>tonight with dining into Annie's.</v>

120
00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:53.940
<v Speaker 1>First.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see how then the scene ends with</v>

121
00:06:53.941 --> 00:06:58.500
<v Speaker 1>Gavin literally leaning into Scotty and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Scotty finally relenting.</v>

122
00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.650
<v Speaker 1>The trap has been set.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hitchcock even frames it so that the two</v>

123
00:07:01.651 --> 00:07:02.484
<v Speaker 1>are overlapping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always loved the scene in Vertigo </v>

124
00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:06.323
<v Speaker 1>in college.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to diagram it out in my </v>

125
00:07:07.771 --> 00:07:08.604
<v Speaker 1>notebooks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure out where he put the </v>

126
00:07:09.901 --> 00:07:10.734
<v Speaker 1>camera on what lenses he used,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's the blocking for these five </v>

127
00:07:13.831 --> 00:07:17.910
<v Speaker 1>continuous minutes that are the real </v>
<v Speaker 1>mark of hitchcock's mastery of the form.</v>

128
00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:22.500
<v Speaker 1>The scene is small and often overlooked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it holds up the rest of the film.</v>

129
00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:23.543
<v Speaker 1>How many other directors could </v>
<v Speaker 1>choreograph this conversation in such a </v>

130
00:07:26.161 --> 00:07:26.994
<v Speaker 1>way that it works like a dance where one</v>
<v Speaker 1>man is leading and performing and the </v>

131
00:07:31.171 --> 00:07:34.370
<v Speaker 1>other is a spectator and a patsy without</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing it.</v>

132
00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:39.380
<v Speaker 1>Yet both Gavin elster and this scene </v>
<v Speaker 1>have hitchcock written all over them.</v>

133
00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:41.713
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's a coincidence that </v>

134
00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:46.490
<v Speaker 1>the man himself isn't too far away.</v>

135
00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:57.690
<v Speaker 1>Hey everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for watching.</v>

136
00:07:57.691 --> 00:07:58.524

<v Speaker 1>college notebooks and I encourage you </v>

<v Speaker 1>yours with complicated blocking and,</v>

138
