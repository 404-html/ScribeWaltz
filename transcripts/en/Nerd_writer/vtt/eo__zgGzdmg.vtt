00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.080
<v Speaker 1>I love the novelist Lawrence Durrell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's why</v>

2
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.940
<v Speaker 1>in the prefatory note to derails novel </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's are he writes,</v>

3
00:00:11.941 --> 00:00:14.970
<v Speaker 1>modern literature offers us know </v>
<v Speaker 1>humanities,</v>

4
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:15.863
<v Speaker 1>so I have turned to science and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to complete a four decker novel </v>

5
00:00:18.961 --> 00:00:21.570
<v Speaker 1>whose form is based on the relativity </v>
<v Speaker 1>proposition.</v>

6
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.890
<v Speaker 1>Three sides of space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of time constitute a soup mix of</v>

7
00:00:25.891 --> 00:00:28.650
<v Speaker 1>a continuum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The four novels follow this pattern.</v>

8
00:00:28.651 --> 00:00:29.484
<v Speaker 1>Darryl's masterpiece.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Alexandria Quartet is modeled after </v>

9
00:00:32.341 --> 00:00:33.174
<v Speaker 1>this concept.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first three novels tell of the same </v>

10
00:00:35.641 --> 00:00:36.474
<v Speaker 1>series of events from different </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspectives with each new novel </v>

11
00:00:39.781 --> 00:00:42.540
<v Speaker 1>recontextualizing what actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>

12
00:00:42.541 --> 00:00:43.374
<v Speaker 1>These represent the three dimensions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>space and show that one perspective can </v>

13
00:00:46.831 --> 00:00:47.664
<v Speaker 1>never illustrate the whole picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fourth and final novel revisits </v>

14
00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:51.834
<v Speaker 1>these same characters five years later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>adding the additional perspective of </v>

15
00:00:55.561 --> 00:00:57.630
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>creating a continuum.</v>

16
00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:58.411
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many people,</v>

17
00:00:58.411 --> 00:01:00.870
<v Speaker 1>including drls friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have noted that saying,</v>

18
00:01:00.871 --> 00:01:01.704
<v Speaker 1>the Alexandria Quartet is a model of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>space time continuum is nothing but a </v>

19
00:01:05.791 --> 00:01:06.780
<v Speaker 1>semantic device.</v>

20
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:07.673
<v Speaker 1>These people are of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>write a continuum of the store can only </v>

21
00:01:10.051 --> 00:01:13.230
<v Speaker 1>be expressed in mathematics and not in </v>
<v Speaker 1>words,</v>

22
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.700
<v Speaker 1>but just as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

23
00:01:14.701 --> 00:01:19.700
<v Speaker 1>the mercator projection is meant to give</v>
<v Speaker 1>the impression of a sphere derails.</v>

24
00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:20.543
<v Speaker 1>Quartet is only meant to give the </v>
<v Speaker 1>impression of a continue as special </v>

25
00:01:23.791 --> 00:01:26.550
<v Speaker 1>relativity forced us to see reality in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>new way.</v>

26
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.350
<v Speaker 1>The form of the quartet does the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing with the concept of personality as</v>

27
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.080
<v Speaker 1>space and time are relative to each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

28
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.340
<v Speaker 1>Personalities are relative to other </v>
<v Speaker 1>personalities.</v>

29
00:01:38.341 --> 00:01:40.350
<v Speaker 1>As Darryl's character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our says,</v>

30
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.610
<v Speaker 1>each psyche is really an anthill of </v>
<v Speaker 1>opposing predispositions.</v>

31
00:01:44.611 --> 00:01:48.450
<v Speaker 1>Personality as something with fixed </v>
<v Speaker 1>attributes is an illusion.</v>

32
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.313
<v Speaker 1>I would go even further and say that </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality as exclusive to one person </v>

33
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.460
<v Speaker 1>is an illusion as well dwells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Continuum,</v>

34
00:01:56.461 --> 00:01:57.294
<v Speaker 1>like representation of a group of lovers</v>
<v Speaker 1>and friends that picks what the </v>

35
00:02:00.571 --> 00:02:01.404
<v Speaker 1>nightvale podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter handle put so succinctly a few </v>

36
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.620
<v Speaker 1>days ago.</v>

37
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.510
<v Speaker 1>A name is ally that keeps you from </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking that you might be more than one</v>

38
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:10.450
<v Speaker 1>single.</v>
<v Speaker 1>B,</v>

39
00:02:10.451 --> 00:02:11.284
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me that the separation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>objects in space leads us to believe </v>

40
00:02:15.121 --> 00:02:19.080
<v Speaker 1>that we ourselves are separate from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ones we love,</v>

41
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.943
<v Speaker 1>when in truth we blend into and warp one</v>
<v Speaker 1>another in the same way that time and </v>

42
00:02:23.761 --> 00:02:27.030
<v Speaker 1>space do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the presence of supermassive objects.</v>

43
00:02:27.031 --> 00:02:30.390
<v Speaker 1>I am an active part of the personalities</v>
<v Speaker 1>of my friends,</v>

44
00:02:30.391 --> 00:02:34.470
<v Speaker 1>just as my friends are active </v>
<v Speaker 1>constituents of my personnel.</v>

45
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.333
<v Speaker 1>Drl is so important to me because in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alexandria Quartet and later in the </v>

46
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:40.793
<v Speaker 1>Avignon Quintet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the basic unit of humanity is never an </v>

47
00:02:43.381 --> 00:02:44.214
<v Speaker 1>individual but a group of friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to depict the complexity of that </v>

48
00:02:49.321 --> 00:02:50.154
<v Speaker 1>unit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drl has to contextualize and </v>

49
00:02:52.231 --> 00:02:57.231
<v Speaker 1>recontextualize until multiple people </v>
<v Speaker 1>begin to feel like one organism.</v>

50
00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.140
<v Speaker 1>He finds the model in four dimensional </v>
<v Speaker 1>space time and it comes off brilliantly.</v>

51
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:03.363
<v Speaker 1>It's the kind of work that breaks down </v>
<v Speaker 1>our self conceptions and shows us what </v>

52
00:03:07.091 --> 00:03:12.091
<v Speaker 1>we is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there's a used bookstore around you,</v>

53
00:03:16.631 --> 00:03:17.464
<v Speaker 1>go find something by Darrelle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Alexandria Quartet is obviously my </v>

54
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.030
<v Speaker 1>favorite and I think it's the best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's are,</v>

55
00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.090
<v Speaker 1>and I have some other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Justine phalluses are mount,</v>

56
00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.110
<v Speaker 1>Mount Olive and clay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also I'm reading right now the first</v>

57
00:03:38.111 --> 00:03:40.810
<v Speaker 1>of the heavy on Quintet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is called Matsuura.</v>
