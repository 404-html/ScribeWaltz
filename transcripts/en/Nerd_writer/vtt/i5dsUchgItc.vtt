<v Speaker 1>Dear sam pepper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a few weeks ago,</v>

2
00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:03.383
<v Speaker 1>some hacker release nude photos of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jennifer Lawrence and some other </v>

3
00:00:06.331 --> 00:00:09.090
<v Speaker 1>celebrities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's something we've seen before.</v>

4
00:00:09.091 --> 00:00:11.520
<v Speaker 1>People's privacy being criminally </v>
<v Speaker 1>violated,</v>

5
00:00:11.521 --> 00:00:14.730
<v Speaker 1>women being criminally objectified on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Internet.</v>

6
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.420
<v Speaker 1>What was surprising was the reaction in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the days following the leak.</v>

7
00:00:18.421 --> 00:00:22.920
<v Speaker 1>Over two dozen articles appeared from </v>
<v Speaker 1>different news and periodical sites with</v>

8
00:00:22.921 --> 00:00:25.920
<v Speaker 1>headlines like you know who's not to </v>
<v Speaker 1>blame for Jennifer Lawrence's nude photo</v>

9
00:00:25.921 --> 00:00:26.754
<v Speaker 1>leaks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jennifer Lawrence stopped blaming </v>

10
00:00:28.141 --> 00:00:28.974
<v Speaker 1>Jennifer Lawrence and other celebrities </v>
<v Speaker 1>for taking nude photos in the first </v>

11
00:00:31.021 --> 00:00:31.854
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jennifer Lawrence shouldn't laugh off </v>

12
00:00:33.031 --> 00:00:33.864
<v Speaker 1>her nude photo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jennifer Lawrence nude pics and why you </v>

13
00:00:35.911 --> 00:00:37.890
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This isn't about iphones.</v>

14
00:00:37.891 --> 00:00:40.080
<v Speaker 1>This is about women being shamed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>objectified,</v>

15
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.033
<v Speaker 1>and treated like property.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are what we refer to as opinion </v>

16
00:00:43.981 --> 00:00:48.120
<v Speaker 1>pieces or think pieces and thanks to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>upworthy is one of the Internet.</v>

17
00:00:48.121 --> 00:00:50.880
<v Speaker 1>You can pretty much get there just from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the headlines alone.</v>

18
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.490
<v Speaker 1>You've been a citizen of the web for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>last five or 10 years,</v>

19
00:00:53.491 --> 00:00:57.600
<v Speaker 1>so you know that the ubiquity of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>pieces is growing all the time.</v>

20
00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.540
<v Speaker 1>After any controversial event in society</v>
<v Speaker 1>or pop culture,</v>

21
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.010
<v Speaker 1>you can expect your facebook newsfeed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>overflow with articles like this.</v>

22
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:09.900
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it's annoying people </v>
<v Speaker 1>expressing offense as if a fence equated</v>

23
00:01:09.901 --> 00:01:10.734
<v Speaker 1>to righteousness or sites producing </v>
<v Speaker 1>content just for the sake of producing </v>

24
00:01:14.071 --> 00:01:15.360
<v Speaker 1>content.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Other times,</v>

25
00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.223
<v Speaker 1>most of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in the case of that nude photo </v>

26
00:01:17.551 --> 00:01:19.830
<v Speaker 1>league,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these articles taken together,</v>

27
00:01:19.831 --> 00:01:22.920
<v Speaker 1>express the politically correct view of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the issue at hand.</v>

28
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:23.783
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>political correctness has a bad rap in </v>

29
00:01:24.721 --> 00:01:25.554
<v Speaker 1>general conversation and like the pieces</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves that can serve to block </v>

30
00:01:28.861 --> 00:01:33.750
<v Speaker 1>dialogue instead of just started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but political correctness is itself only</v>

31
00:01:33.751 --> 00:01:34.584
<v Speaker 1>an expression of our democratic concern </v>
<v Speaker 1>for groups who are habitually and </v>

32
00:01:38.371 --> 00:01:40.890
<v Speaker 1>unfairly discriminated against.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

33
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.670
<v Speaker 1>it's an expression of morality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we understand to be right and wrong</v>

34
00:01:44.671 --> 00:01:48.750
<v Speaker 1>at this moment in time when coupled with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ubiquity of these think pieces,</v>

35
00:01:48.751 --> 00:01:49.584
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me that socially enforced </v>
<v Speaker 1>morality has reached an entirely new </v>

36
00:01:53.401 --> 00:01:56.100
<v Speaker 1>level of persuasive power for the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

37
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.160
<v Speaker 1>The majority of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I asked about the photo and particularly</v>

38
00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.143
<v Speaker 1>men told me that they didn't seek out or</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at the photos in question citing </v>

39
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.883
<v Speaker 1>the reasons in those articles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you disagreed with what they </v>

40
00:02:07.441 --> 00:02:08.580
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I didn't.</v>

41
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:09.623
<v Speaker 1>Those articles served as a sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>script for what to say to family and </v>

42
00:02:12.871 --> 00:02:13.704
<v Speaker 1>friends and coworkers if you wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>stay in good ethical standing with the </v>

43
00:02:17.131 --> 00:02:18.900
<v Speaker 1>community that they represent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

44
00:02:18.901 --> 00:02:20.610
<v Speaker 1>the response to your video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sam,</v>

45
00:02:20.611 --> 00:02:24.060
<v Speaker 1>of pinching girls on the butt is of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same vein only.</v>

46
00:02:24.061 --> 00:02:24.894
<v Speaker 1>It didn't happen in online periodicals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It happened right here on Youtube and </v>

47
00:02:28.981 --> 00:02:32.010
<v Speaker 1>tumblr before it was taken down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your video had over double the amount of</v>

48
00:02:32.011 --> 00:02:32.844
<v Speaker 1>dislikes than likes about 70,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>and my tumblr feed was spilling over </v>

49
00:02:36.241 --> 00:02:37.074
<v Speaker 1>with elegant condemnations of what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>did have particular significance where </v>

50
00:02:40.021 --> 00:02:40.854
<v Speaker 1>the responses of John and Hank Green,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are never slow to speak out about </v>

51
00:02:44.371 --> 00:02:45.204
<v Speaker 1>situations like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether they would accept the title or </v>

52
00:02:46.891 --> 00:02:47.724
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Vlog brothers have stepped forward </v>

53
00:02:49.291 --> 00:02:51.900
<v Speaker 1>as moral arbiter is on a host of issues.</v>

54
00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.170
<v Speaker 1>Even if all they do is signal boost the </v>
<v Speaker 1>opinions of others.</v>

55
00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.270
<v Speaker 1>In the case of the marginalization of </v>
<v Speaker 1>women,</v>

56
00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.111
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

57
00:02:58.111 --> 00:02:58.944
<v Speaker 1>the Alex Day deal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are never equivocal and their </v>

58
00:03:01.841 --> 00:03:04.660
<v Speaker 1>community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my community is the better for it.</v>

59
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.030
<v Speaker 1>Last Monday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube removed your video,</v>

60
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.893
<v Speaker 1>Sam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and though it clearly violated their </v>

61
00:03:09.191 --> 00:03:13.990
<v Speaker 1>policy on nudity and sexual content,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is no doubt that the public outcry</v>

62
00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:15.550
<v Speaker 1>is responsible for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

63
00:03:15.551 --> 00:03:18.130
<v Speaker 1>I know this is a somewhat cold analysis </v>
<v Speaker 1>of things,</v>

64
00:03:18.131 --> 00:03:21.430
<v Speaker 1>but I'm fascinated by the sociological </v>
<v Speaker 1>trends at work here,</v>

65
00:03:21.431 --> 00:03:25.360
<v Speaker 1>how moral perspectives move and advance </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the culture,</v>

66
00:03:25.361 --> 00:03:26.194
<v Speaker 1>how and by what avenues they evolve from</v>
<v Speaker 1>dissenting to acceptable do </v>

67
00:03:30.281 --> 00:03:34.600
<v Speaker 1>unquestionable and what role an internet</v>
<v Speaker 1>of commenters has to play and all that.</v>

68
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.090
<v Speaker 1>For the record,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I share the morality of the Vlog.</v>

69
00:03:37.091 --> 00:03:38.770
<v Speaker 1>Brothers and everyone who has re </v>
<v Speaker 1>blogged,</v>

70
00:03:38.771 --> 00:03:39.604
<v Speaker 1>what they've written about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the objectification of women is </v>

71
00:03:41.471 --> 00:03:42.304
<v Speaker 1>detestable in all its kinds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially those which are hard to see </v>

72
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.310
<v Speaker 1>and insidious yet keenly felt by every </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman.</v>

73
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.960
<v Speaker 1>I know this is a harmful gross and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking tedious way to act.</v>

74
00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:56.260
<v Speaker 1>There's still a long way to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you and all the other Sam peppers of</v>

75
00:03:56.261 --> 00:03:59.050
<v Speaker 1>the world should really read the writing</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the dashboard.</v>

76
00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.930
<v Speaker 1>Collectively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've left you behind.</v>

77
00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.500
<v Speaker 1>Hey everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for watching.</v>

78
00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:05.723
<v Speaker 1>The gradual evolution of morality really</v>
<v Speaker 1>is fascinating to me and it has </v>

79
00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.550
<v Speaker 1>instruments all across the culture and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sharpest and most vicious has got to</v>

80
00:04:14.551 --> 00:04:15.384
<v Speaker 1>be South Park and a great example of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>expression of morality from the culture </v>

81
00:04:19.681 --> 00:04:22.290
<v Speaker 1>is their takedown of the redskins team </v>
<v Speaker 1>name,</v>

82
00:04:22.291 --> 00:04:26.850
<v Speaker 1>which appeared in a commercial during </v>
<v Speaker 1>the redskins game last week and I'll put</v>

83
00:04:26.851 --> 00:04:30.120
<v Speaker 1>a link for it below.</v>
<v Speaker 1>South Park's amazing.</v>

84
00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.210
<v Speaker 1>If you want to talk more about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am always in comments for.</v>

85
00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.210
<v Speaker 1>You can ask me anything on Tumbler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks again for watching.</v>

86
00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.380
<v Speaker 1>I'll see you next time.</v>
