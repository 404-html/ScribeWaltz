<v Speaker 1>Good friends at gibbons wrote of ancient</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rome that the devout polytheists,</v>

2
00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:17.460
<v Speaker 1>though finally attached to his national </v>
<v Speaker 1>rights,</v>

3
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.660
<v Speaker 1>admitted with implicit faith,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the different religions of the earth,</v>

4
00:00:21.661 --> 00:00:22.890
<v Speaker 1>fear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gratitude,</v>

5
00:00:22.891 --> 00:00:25.130
<v Speaker 1>and curiosity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a dream or an omen,</v>

6
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:25.973
<v Speaker 1>the singular disorder or a distant </v>
<v Speaker 1>journey perpetually disposed him to </v>

7
00:00:30.061 --> 00:00:34.530
<v Speaker 1>multiply the articles of his belief and </v>
<v Speaker 1>to enlarge the list of his protectors.</v>

8
00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.310
<v Speaker 1>Holly theism is a chaotic and </v>
<v Speaker 1>historically beautiful condition.</v>

9
00:00:38.311 --> 00:00:39.144
<v Speaker 1>It's not so hard to imagine our </v>
<v Speaker 1>forefathers of antiquity devoid as they </v>

10
00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:46.050
<v Speaker 1>were of explanations for earthquakes or </v>
<v Speaker 1>debilitating diseases stars.</v>

11
00:00:46.051 --> 00:00:46.884
<v Speaker 1>It's not so hard to imagine them </v>
<v Speaker 1>assigning these mysterious forces a </v>

12
00:00:49.981 --> 00:00:51.360
<v Speaker 1>percentage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a deity,</v>

13
00:00:51.361 --> 00:00:52.194
<v Speaker 1>of what else distinctly human shape and </v>
<v Speaker 1>character whose job it was to oversee </v>

14
00:00:56.551 --> 00:00:57.384
<v Speaker 1>this or that sphere of existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This way of thinking is called </v>

15
00:00:59.761 --> 00:01:00.594
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>in which the world and its forces are </v>

16
00:01:02.281 --> 00:01:03.114
<v Speaker 1>described by stories of holy origin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the mythical man wants to explain </v>

17
00:01:06.211 --> 00:01:09.270
<v Speaker 1>the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he does it based on God's and powers,</v>

18
00:01:09.271 --> 00:01:12.420
<v Speaker 1>and if he is a more elegant thinker in </v>
<v Speaker 1>fiction and allegory,</v>

19
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.510
<v Speaker 1>the worldview of mythos and polytheism </v>
<v Speaker 1>is necessarily disordered and archaic.</v>

20
00:01:17.611 --> 00:01:18.444
<v Speaker 1>There need be no unifying principle to </v>
<v Speaker 1>connect things because the universe as </v>

21
00:01:21.961 --> 00:01:22.794
<v Speaker 1>such is at the caprices of these gods </v>
<v Speaker 1>and goddesses who to read the poetry </v>

22
00:01:26.431 --> 00:01:29.340
<v Speaker 1>about them agree about as much as we </v>
<v Speaker 1>human story.</v>

23
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.540
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now there's</v>

24
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.600
<v Speaker 1>one institution that can exist in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>world dominated exclusively by Mythos,</v>

25
00:01:36.601 --> 00:01:39.690
<v Speaker 1>and that is the institution of science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

26
00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.553
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we know that the foundational </v>

27
00:01:41.761 --> 00:01:44.880
<v Speaker 1>principle of science is the principle of</v>
<v Speaker 1>no contradiction.</v>

28
00:01:44.881 --> 00:01:45.714
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's scientific theory is only valid </v>

29
00:01:47.371 --> 00:01:51.780
<v Speaker 1>until a contradiction is found.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In which case set theory must be revised</v>

30
00:01:51.781 --> 00:01:52.614
<v Speaker 1>or scrapped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing in polytheism resembles this </v>

31
00:01:55.861 --> 00:01:56.694
<v Speaker 1>kind of logic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Contradiction in mythos is totally </v>

32
00:01:59.191 --> 00:02:00.050
<v Speaker 1>acceptable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're.</v>

33
00:02:00.051 --> 00:02:00.884
<v Speaker 1>Does science come from well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is perhaps the greatest irony of </v>

34
00:02:03.211 --> 00:02:06.690
<v Speaker 1>all science proceeds historically from </v>
<v Speaker 1>monotheism,</v>

35
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.000
<v Speaker 1>a belief system held originally by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jews,</v>

36
00:02:09.001 --> 00:02:12.210
<v Speaker 1>that there was one all powerful God from</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's massive.</v>

37
00:02:12.211 --> 00:02:13.044
<v Speaker 1>Mine comes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The uniform ordered universe makes </v>

38
00:02:15.661 --> 00:02:16.471
<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't it?</v>

39
00:02:16.471 --> 00:02:17.304
<v Speaker 1>For Science to work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it must assume that the universe is </v>

40
00:02:19.321 --> 00:02:23.400
<v Speaker 1>organized by a unifying principle and </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that doesn't appear until the early</v>

41
00:02:23.401 --> 00:02:24.234
<v Speaker 1>sixth century BC when exiled Jews in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Babylon begin the process of redacting </v>

42
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.333
<v Speaker 1>the many texts of the Hebrew tradition </v>
<v Speaker 1>into what became the old testament was </v>

43
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.630
<v Speaker 1>failing as a pre socratic Malaysian </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosopher of the same era who saw that</v>

44
00:02:36.631 --> 00:02:37.464
<v Speaker 1>such a reduction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the singular texts and the singular God </v>

45
00:02:39.961 --> 00:02:43.080
<v Speaker 1>it described suggested the principle of </v>
<v Speaker 1>no contradiction.</v>

46
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.913
<v Speaker 1>If God created a universe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it had to be ordered and uniform </v>

47
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.150
<v Speaker 1>and so in the person of families and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>subsequent socratic thinkers,</v>

48
00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:55.440
<v Speaker 1>the famous transitioned from myths.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those two logos takes place.</v>

49
00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.350
<v Speaker 1>Logos is a way of explanation </v>
<v Speaker 1>concentrated around argument,</v>

50
00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:59.243
<v Speaker 1>what aristotle later formalizes as logic</v>
<v Speaker 1>in which an or can be brought around to </v>

51
00:03:03.251 --> 00:03:04.084
<v Speaker 1>the other side of a logical disputes </v>
<v Speaker 1>simply by being shown the contradiction </v>

52
00:03:07.241 --> 00:03:08.074
<v Speaker 1>in his argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's humbling to know the close causal </v>

53
00:03:10.301 --> 00:03:13.600
<v Speaker 1>historical connection between monotheism</v>
<v Speaker 1>and modern science.</v>

54
00:03:13.601 --> 00:03:16.990
<v Speaker 1>That connection modern scientists are </v>
<v Speaker 1>low dimension.</v>

55
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.250
<v Speaker 1>The truth is that science is as firmly </v>
<v Speaker 1>rooted in belief as religion.</v>

56
00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.660
<v Speaker 1>It cannot work without the assumption </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the universe is ordered and follows</v>

57
00:03:25.661 --> 00:03:28.330
<v Speaker 1>the rule of no contradiction like </v>
<v Speaker 1>science says it does.</v>

58
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.740
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a postscript,</v>

59
00:03:29.741 --> 00:03:33.100
<v Speaker 1>you may be asking yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does this mean that religion is as valid</v>

60
00:03:33.101 --> 00:03:37.090
<v Speaker 1>and epistemological system as sciences?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are both based on belief.</v>

61
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.140
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a very simple answer for that.</v>

62
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:41.583
<v Speaker 1>No</v>

63
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.890
<v Speaker 3>city.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The city.</v>
