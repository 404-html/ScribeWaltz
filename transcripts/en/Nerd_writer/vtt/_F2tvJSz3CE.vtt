1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.320
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here we go,</v>

2
00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:05.070
<v Speaker 1>fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You going to fight for in it.</v>

3
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying he's fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when he jumps in the yard,</v>

4
00:00:07.401 --> 00:00:11.980
<v Speaker 1>he gets stuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jim,</v>

5
00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:13.543
<v Speaker 1>Gary,</v>

6
00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:16.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody that you know,</v>

7
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.000
<v Speaker 2>including yourself is a mind reader.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At least we all think we are.</v>

8
00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:24.030
<v Speaker 2>We act that way because really there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>no other way to act.</v>

9
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:25.103
<v Speaker 2>We see someone do something like look at</v>
<v Speaker 2>a camera and attribute to that act and </v>

10
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:29.453
<v Speaker 2>invisible mental state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a desire and intention of feeling like </v>

11
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.300
<v Speaker 2>disbelief.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is called the theory of mind,</v>

12
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:37.493
<v Speaker 2>but there's a paradox at the heart of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this ability that we all have because </v>

13
00:00:40.921 --> 00:00:41.754
<v Speaker 2>while we know that body language conveys</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning and that we can interpret that </v>

14
00:00:45.031 --> 00:00:47.880
<v Speaker 2>meaning and even be roughly correct a </v>
<v Speaker 2>good amount of the time,</v>

15
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.133
<v Speaker 2>we also know that it's impossible to see</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole picture that we can </v>

16
00:00:51.751 --> 00:00:56.220
<v Speaker 2>misinterpret and be fooled because both </v>
<v Speaker 2>of those things have happened to us.</v>

17
00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:57.700
<v Speaker 3>I was just wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

18
00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.860
<v Speaker 3>Niceville with Lee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would you?</v>

19
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.870
<v Speaker 3>Let's come in Virginia with me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't split up with him as a friend.</v>

20
00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.120
<v Speaker 3>So I didn't mean as a friend</v>

21
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.360
<v Speaker 2>paradox in the theory of mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our attributes of thoughts to action and</v>

22
00:01:14.361 --> 00:01:15.194
<v Speaker 2>our knowledge of the unreliability in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that drives all of us to perform </v>

23
00:01:19.011 --> 00:01:19.844
<v Speaker 2>ourselves so that we can try to shape </v>
<v Speaker 2>other people's theories of our mind and </v>

24
00:01:24.351 --> 00:01:28.340
<v Speaker 2>it's this performance and the reading of</v>
<v Speaker 2>this performance that the office created</v>

25
00:01:28.341 --> 00:01:31.850
<v Speaker 2>by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant </v>
<v Speaker 2>spotlights so well.</v>

26
00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.043
<v Speaker 2>The people who work at wornum hog </v>
<v Speaker 2>comprise a spectrum of competence on </v>

27
00:01:36.291 --> 00:01:39.380
<v Speaker 2>this scale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On one side you have tim and Don who are</v>

28
00:01:39.381 --> 00:01:40.214
<v Speaker 2>quite sensitive mind readers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>able to navigate the environment of the </v>

29
00:01:42.861 --> 00:01:45.410
<v Speaker 2>office with a strong sense of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>others are feeling.</v>

30
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.960
<v Speaker 2>And on the other side you have David,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brent,</v>

31
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.200
<v Speaker 2>and Gareth who are really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really weak</v>

32
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.133
<v Speaker 3>mind readers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you do go the way Tim and you expect </v>

33
00:01:53.821 --> 00:01:58.410
<v Speaker 3>me to go in there afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>make sure he wears a condom.</v>

34
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.673
<v Speaker 2>In the case of Gareth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it may actually be that he's unable to </v>

35
00:02:04.081 --> 00:02:06.600
<v Speaker 2>read others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jervis explored this idea again,</v>

36
00:02:06.601 --> 00:02:07.434
<v Speaker 2>years later with Derek,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a character who fall somewhere on the </v>

37
00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:10.643
<v Speaker 2>autism spectrum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a condition that's marked by inherent </v>

38
00:02:12.931 --> 00:02:16.140
<v Speaker 2>difficulties with theory of mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in David Brent,</v>

39
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.170
<v Speaker 2>we have a character so invested in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>performance of himself that he's blocked</v>

40
00:02:21.481 --> 00:02:22.314
<v Speaker 2>his own access to other's feelings and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think Brent could become more receptive </v>

41
00:02:25.951 --> 00:02:29.550
<v Speaker 2>and there are rare but achingly poignant</v>
<v Speaker 2>flashes of that in the series.</v>

42
00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.990
<v Speaker 1>Chris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what don't you fuck off</v>

43
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.750
<v Speaker 2>to really do that would require </v>
<v Speaker 2>compromising his self image,</v>

44
00:02:35.751 --> 00:02:38.150
<v Speaker 2>which is clearly something that he's not</v>
<v Speaker 2>willing to do.</v>

45
00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:39.493
<v Speaker 2>The irony is that Brent can't see that a</v>
<v Speaker 2>weak theory of mind always makes for a </v>

46
00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.050
<v Speaker 2>week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Self-Performance.</v>

47
00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.093
<v Speaker 2>You can't brute force your preferred </v>
<v Speaker 2>personality onto another's </v>

48
00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.410
<v Speaker 2>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It takes two to build an identity.</v>

49
00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:52.273
<v Speaker 2>Indeed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what makes tim the most </v>

50
00:02:53.091 --> 00:02:56.900
<v Speaker 2>successful performer of all on the show </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the clearest evidence of this is the</v>

51
00:02:56.901 --> 00:02:59.950
<v Speaker 2>cruel but hilarious way that he toys </v>
<v Speaker 2>with Gareth,</v>

52
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.010
<v Speaker 2>could you give a man a lethal blow for?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was forced to.</v>

53
00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.963
<v Speaker 2>I could if it was absolutely necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's able to map Gareth's mental state </v>

54
00:03:09.231 --> 00:03:10.064
<v Speaker 2>so well and take advantage of his weak </v>
<v Speaker 2>theory of mine that he can ridicule him </v>

55
00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:15.340
<v Speaker 2>without Gareth even knowing that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on.</v>

56
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.440
<v Speaker 2>This is a kind of psychic superpower and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all use it when we tell someone,</v>

57
00:03:20.441 --> 00:03:21.670
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a white lie,</v>

58
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:22.773
<v Speaker 2>we're trying to decode that person's </v>
<v Speaker 2>mental state so that our performance of </v>

59
00:03:25.811 --> 00:03:27.760
<v Speaker 2>the lie will be successfully received.</v>

60
00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.983
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a believable performance is one that </v>

61
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.440
<v Speaker 2>reflects back at your partner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that's in support of their own</v>

62
00:03:35.441 --> 00:03:36.274
<v Speaker 2>performance of themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What makes the show even more </v>

63
00:03:38.171 --> 00:03:39.004
<v Speaker 2>impressive?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think an absolutely true to life is </v>

64
00:03:41.051 --> 00:03:43.690
<v Speaker 2>the way that it handles the other side </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the paradox.</v>

65
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.883
<v Speaker 2>No matter where the characters fall on </v>
<v Speaker 2>that spectrum of mind reading or </v>

66
00:03:47.501 --> 00:03:51.100
<v Speaker 2>performance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>none are spared from mistakes.</v>

67
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:52.263
<v Speaker 2>It's this essential defect in the theory</v>
<v Speaker 2>of mine that's a cause of deep anxiety </v>

68
00:03:55.631 --> 00:03:56.464
<v Speaker 2>for all of us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and every time that unreliability is </v>

69
00:03:58.931 --> 00:03:59.764
<v Speaker 2>violently revealed to us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world for a brief moment becomes </v>

70
00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.100
<v Speaker 2>jibberish and the people around us </v>
<v Speaker 2>opaque</v>

71
00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.270
<v Speaker 2>because this is the only tool that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>

72
00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.393
<v Speaker 2>and for the most part it's done like </v>
<v Speaker 2>breathing is done without conscious </v>

73
00:04:13.481 --> 00:04:15.640
<v Speaker 2>attention,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so when it fails,</v>

74
00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:16.713
<v Speaker 2>there's just no recourse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the unflinching focus on these </v>

75
00:04:20.261 --> 00:04:22.750
<v Speaker 2>failures that made the office </v>
<v Speaker 2>revolutionary.</v>

76
00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.810
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people say that cringe humor </v>
<v Speaker 2>like this is hard to watch,</v>

77
00:04:25.811 --> 00:04:26.644
<v Speaker 2>and certainly it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in the same way that under our </v>

78
00:04:28.721 --> 00:04:31.990
<v Speaker 2>confidence in theory of mind lies and </v>
<v Speaker 2>anxiety,</v>

79
00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:33.243
<v Speaker 2>I think that under our cringing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's actually a deep feeling of </v>

80
00:04:36.191 --> 00:04:37.570
<v Speaker 2>relief.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cringe.</v>

81
00:04:37.571 --> 00:04:41.830
<v Speaker 2>Humor privileges the moments when body </v>
<v Speaker 2>language speaks in a way that is totally</v>

82
00:04:41.831 --> 00:04:43.750
<v Speaker 2>transparent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In that moment,</v>

83
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.490
<v Speaker 2>the embarrassment is not only palpable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also palpably honest.</v>

84
00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.980
<v Speaker 2>It can't be doubted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a kind of trauma,</v>

85
00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.280
<v Speaker 2>a rupture that discloses a real moment </v>
<v Speaker 2>of</v>

86
00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:59.410
<v Speaker 3>connection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

87
00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:04.880
<v Speaker 3>David,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

88
00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.580
<v Speaker 3>I've changed my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want redundancy.</v>

89
00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:10.140
<v Speaker 3>I don't want not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>haven't signed anything so well,</v>

90
00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:13.050
<v Speaker 3>unfortunately.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not really up to you.</v>

91
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.360
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alright.</v>

92
00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.450
<v Speaker 3>Then when I'm asking please.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That might be redundant.</v>

93
00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't think the show would be nearly </v>
<v Speaker 2>as effective if it wasn't cast as a fake</v>

94
00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:25.553
<v Speaker 2>documentary as opposed to simply </v>
<v Speaker 2>watching the characters fail and </v>

95
00:05:28.891 --> 00:05:31.380
<v Speaker 2>embarrass themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As an omniscient observer.</v>

96
00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:35.100
<v Speaker 2>The employees of the office are aware of</v>
<v Speaker 2>being filmed,</v>

97
00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.950
<v Speaker 2>which is to say that they're aware of </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

98
00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.250
<v Speaker 2>but not only performing for one another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're performing for us.</v>

99
00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.150
<v Speaker 2>This is the phenomenon of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>documentary and the documentary.</v>

100
00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.013
<v Speaker 2>You can observe human behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mind reading you and performing at you </v>

101
00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.250
<v Speaker 2>without having to reflect back your own </v>
<v Speaker 2>performance.</v>

102
00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:54.563
<v Speaker 2>You can be alone with someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jason Merchant exploit the situation to </v>

103
00:05:58.551 --> 00:05:59.384
<v Speaker 2>activate our empathy in a uniquely </v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful way so that when you laugh at </v>

104
00:06:03.351 --> 00:06:07.010
<v Speaker 2>the office,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a laugh that rings out in the heart</v>

105
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:10.940
<v Speaker 2>of moment of cringeworthy truth.</v>

106
00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:16.340
<v Speaker 2>Everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thanks for watching.</v>

107
00:06:16.341 --> 00:06:18.310
<v Speaker 2>I really wish I could be recording this </v>
<v Speaker 2>on a camera right now,</v>

108
00:06:18.311 --> 00:06:19.750
<v Speaker 2>but it's a little bit too late and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

109
00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.490
<v Speaker 2>my office is so really incomplete in Los</v>
<v Speaker 2>Angeles and it's,</v>

110
00:06:22.491 --> 00:06:23.870
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just very frustrating.</v>

111
00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:24.843
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank you so much to squarespace for </v>

112
00:06:26.061 --> 00:06:28.670
<v Speaker 2>sponsoring this video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really fortunate to have squarespace</v>

113
00:06:28.671 --> 00:06:30.500
<v Speaker 2>helping to fund this channel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They make a really,</v>

114
00:06:30.501 --> 00:06:32.330
<v Speaker 2>really great product.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a professional,</v>

115
00:06:32.331 --> 00:06:33.164
<v Speaker 2>sleek looking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>intuitive websites that you don't need </v>

116
