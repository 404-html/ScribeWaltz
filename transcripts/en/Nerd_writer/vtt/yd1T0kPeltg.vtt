00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.720
<v Speaker 1>With all the excitement surrounding the </v>
<v Speaker 1>2008 election,</v>

2
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:13.583
<v Speaker 1>it might be surprising to learn that </v>
<v Speaker 1>only 56 point nine percent of eligible </v>

3
00:00:17.701 --> 00:00:20.130
<v Speaker 1>citizens a little over half the </v>
<v Speaker 1>population,</v>

4
00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.980
<v Speaker 1>it turned out to vote that year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty bad,</v>

5
00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:27.210
<v Speaker 1>but at least it was a few points better </v>
<v Speaker 1>than 2012 and this kind of voter turnout</v>

6
00:00:27.211 --> 00:00:30.000
<v Speaker 1>puts us pretty low on the list of </v>
<v Speaker 1>developed countries,</v>

7
00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:30.834
<v Speaker 1>which is not something to be proud of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also means that voter </v>

8
00:00:33.781 --> 00:00:37.590
<v Speaker 1>mobilization efforts have the potential </v>
<v Speaker 1>to yield massive results.</v>

9
00:00:37.591 --> 00:00:38.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

10
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.510
<v Speaker 1>Romney only lost to Obama by 5 million </v>
<v Speaker 1>votes last time.</v>

11
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.553
<v Speaker 1>It's a pretty small number compared to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the $112 million still up for grabs and </v>

12
00:00:47.801 --> 00:00:48.634
<v Speaker 1>get out the vote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Campaigns come in a few different </v>

13
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.233
<v Speaker 1>varieties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The most inane and probably the least </v>

14
00:00:53.461 --> 00:00:54.294
<v Speaker 1>effective is that kind work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leonardo Dicaprio in a laundry list of </v>

15
00:00:57.001 --> 00:01:00.000
<v Speaker 1>other celebrities command you to vote </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the TV.</v>

16
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:00.781
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously,</v>

17
00:01:00.781 --> 00:01:03.360
<v Speaker 1>after all this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after this whole video,</v>

18
00:01:03.361 --> 00:01:06.090
<v Speaker 1>if you're not going to vote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know what the sad anymore.</v>

19
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.901
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leo,</v>

20
00:01:06.901 --> 00:01:11.730
<v Speaker 1>that really hurts even self-aware and </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedic campaigns in this vein,</v>

21
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.730
<v Speaker 1>like the one just Sweden made earlier </v>
<v Speaker 1>this year like lead,</v>

22
00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:15.573
<v Speaker 1>don't move the needle all that much </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they rely on old fashioned </v>

23
00:01:18.751 --> 00:01:19.584
<v Speaker 1>techniques,</v>
<v Speaker 1>namely a handful of righteous messages </v>

24
00:01:21.811 --> 00:01:25.950
<v Speaker 1>that include things like it's your </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility to vote for your voice,</v>

25
00:01:25.951 --> 00:01:29.910
<v Speaker 1>won't be heard otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or it's historic and slash or really,</v>

26
00:01:29.911 --> 00:01:31.950
<v Speaker 1>really close election.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The while,</v>

27
00:01:31.951 --> 00:01:34.080
<v Speaker 1>these are all really good reasons to </v>
<v Speaker 1>vote.</v>

28
00:01:34.081 --> 00:01:38.970
<v Speaker 1>They all operate under the assumption of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a behavioral theory called rational self</v>

29
00:01:38.971 --> 00:01:42.870
<v Speaker 1>interest for decades and decades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People assume that if social norms about</v>

30
00:01:42.871 --> 00:01:43.704
<v Speaker 1>voting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're heavily reinforced like they are </v>

31
00:01:45.211 --> 00:01:48.540
<v Speaker 1>in those ads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then people would just comply to satisfy</v>

32
00:01:48.541 --> 00:01:51.450
<v Speaker 1>their sense of civic duty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>

33
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.313
<v Speaker 1>when put to the test,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these techniques came up way short than </v>

34
00:01:54.481 --> 00:01:54.930
<v Speaker 1>a landmark.</v>

35
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:55.763
<v Speaker 1>Two thousand eight paper from Gerber </v>
<v Speaker 1>Green and larimer extensive studies </v>

36
00:01:58.471 --> 00:01:59.304
<v Speaker 1>found that theories based on rational </v>
<v Speaker 1>self interested behavior generally fail </v>

37
00:02:02.771 --> 00:02:06.360
<v Speaker 1>to predict significant turnout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This goes for celebrities talking to you</v>

38
00:02:06.361 --> 00:02:09.060
<v Speaker 1>through the TV or online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well as phone banks,</v>

39
00:02:09.061 --> 00:02:11.250
<v Speaker 1>direct mail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or door to door canvasing.</v>

40
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.280
<v Speaker 1>The problem is that plenty of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell you they're going to vote,</v>

41
00:02:14.281 --> 00:02:17.460
<v Speaker 1>but don't actually do so when the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes,</v>

42
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:18.653
<v Speaker 1>but behavioral research can offer us </v>
<v Speaker 1>some tricks to help study show for </v>

43
00:02:21.421 --> 00:02:22.254
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you ask people about their </v>

44
00:02:23.581 --> 00:02:24.414
<v Speaker 1>specific plan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ask them where they're voting or how </v>

45
00:02:26.401 --> 00:02:27.234
<v Speaker 1>they're going to get there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could double or triple your </v>

46
00:02:28.861 --> 00:02:30.120
<v Speaker 1>effectiveness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

47
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.983
<v Speaker 1>campaigners often tell people that every</v>
<v Speaker 1>vote counts more when there's a low </v>

48
00:02:34.231 --> 00:02:37.050
<v Speaker 1>turnout,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so their vote is extra important,</v>

49
00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.243
<v Speaker 1>but the research shows that people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>more likely to vote if they think </v>

50
00:02:40.861 --> 00:02:42.480
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be a high turnout.</v>

51
00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.840
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if everyone else is doing it too.</v>

52
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.873
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what if you really wanted to boost </v>

53
00:02:49.201 --> 00:02:50.034
<v Speaker 1>the vote?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there anything that would motivate </v>

54
00:02:51.481 --> 00:02:54.030
<v Speaker 1>people in a really big way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

55
00:02:54.031 --> 00:02:54.864
<v Speaker 1>let's go back to that paper from Gerber </v>
<v Speaker 1>Green and Larabar because I think it's </v>

56
00:02:57.481 --> 00:02:58.314
<v Speaker 1>really fascinating what they did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They basically conducted a large scale </v>

57
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.133
<v Speaker 1>field experiment where they mailed out </v>
<v Speaker 1>letters to four different groups of </v>

58
00:03:04.961 --> 00:03:08.530
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first was a standard campaign mailer</v>

59
00:03:08.531 --> 00:03:09.364
<v Speaker 1>that said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do your civic duty vote basically like </v>

60
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.790
<v Speaker 1>those commercials who were looking at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the second inform people that they would</v>

61
00:03:15.791 --> 00:03:18.970
<v Speaker 1>be confidentially studying voter turnout</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the election.</v>

62
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.073
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me just pause here to say something </v>

63
00:03:21.521 --> 00:03:26.500
<v Speaker 1>that you may not know in America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's voting record.</v>

64
00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.030
<v Speaker 1>It's public.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

65
00:03:28.031 --> 00:03:31.510
<v Speaker 1>don't freak out because you can't find </v>
<v Speaker 1>out who people voted for,</v>

66
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.390
<v Speaker 1>only if they voted or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

67
00:03:34.391 --> 00:03:35.224
<v Speaker 1>in the third meal or the researchers did</v>
<v Speaker 1>just that they mailed people their own </v>

68
00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:40.690
<v Speaker 1>voting record from the past two </v>
<v Speaker 1>elections.</v>

69
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.930
<v Speaker 1>Looks like Robert Wayne wasn't able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make it out there in 2004 and the fourth</v>

70
00:03:45.971 --> 00:03:46.804
<v Speaker 1>mailer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is where it gets really </v>

71
00:03:47.921 --> 00:03:50.290
<v Speaker 1>interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>takes it one step further.</v>

72
00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.530
<v Speaker 1>Not only did they send out people's </v>
<v Speaker 1>voting records,</v>

73
00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.873
<v Speaker 1>but they also included the voting </v>
<v Speaker 1>records of their neighbor so that </v>

74
00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.620
<v Speaker 1>everyone could see who voted and who </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't.</v>

75
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.450
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while the turnout of the first group,</v>

76
00:04:01.451 --> 00:04:03.670
<v Speaker 1>the group who got the regular mailer </v>
<v Speaker 1>raised,</v>

77
00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:04.593
<v Speaker 1>one point eight percentage points,</v>
<v Speaker 1>turnout in the last group increased by </v>

78
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.943
<v Speaker 1>eight point one percentage points,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a huge increase and it makes </v>

79
00:04:13.331 --> 00:04:15.580
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't want to be the only one on my</v>

80
00:04:15.581 --> 00:04:16.414
<v Speaker 1>block who didn't vote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm not saying this is the right </v>

81
00:04:19.121 --> 00:04:20.890
<v Speaker 1>thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably not,</v>

82
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:21.933
<v Speaker 1>but imagine if facebook told you that it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was instituting a flair on your avatar </v>

83
00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.980
<v Speaker 1>after the election based on the public </v>
<v Speaker 1>record that simply said,</v>

84
00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.580
<v Speaker 1>voted something that you didn't have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>put up if you didn't want to,</v>

85
00:04:33.581 --> 00:04:34.414
<v Speaker 1>but couldn't put up if you didn't vote </v>
<v Speaker 1>or imagine if it just put a big didn't </v>

86
00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:39.183
<v Speaker 1>vote after someone's saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet you'd see a pretty significant </v>

87
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.170
<v Speaker 1>increase in voting across the board.</v>

88
00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:45.723
<v Speaker 1>Now I realized that shaming people is </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably not the best motivator and </v>

89
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.840
<v Speaker 1>researchers found that this method did </v>
<v Speaker 1>receive a fair amount of backlash,</v>

90
00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.823
<v Speaker 1>but it is interesting to think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>voter participation is something that </v>

91
00:04:56.561 --> 00:04:57.394
<v Speaker 1>concerns all of us because only about </v>
<v Speaker 1>half of Americans vote every four years </v>

92
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.110
<v Speaker 1>and far fewer at local elections in </v>
<v Speaker 1>between.</v>

93
00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:06.003
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just imagine if the over 100 million </v>

94
00:05:07.871 --> 00:05:10.420
<v Speaker 1>people who don't vote could be motivated</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do so.</v>

95
00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.930
<v Speaker 1>The political landscape that everyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>seems to be so tired of could be totally</v>

96
00:05:15.941 --> 00:05:17.880
<v Speaker 1>transformed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

97
00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:19.720
<v Speaker 1>don't take it from me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

98
00:05:19.721 --> 00:05:21.040
<v Speaker 1>seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after all this,</v>

99
00:05:21.041 --> 00:05:23.750
<v Speaker 1>after this whole video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're not going to run,</v>

100
00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:25.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know what to say to you </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

101
00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.270
<v Speaker 2>There is a new nerve writer video every </v>
<v Speaker 2>Wednesdays.</v>

102
00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.110
<v Speaker 2>Be in that box right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

103
00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.280
<v Speaker 2>Forget about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you see it as Florence,</v>

104
00:05:34.281 --> 00:05:36.050
<v Speaker 2>Italy and it's the most beautiful thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've ever seen.</v>

105
00:05:36.051 --> 00:05:37.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm here with my parents today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hon.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's been so amazing.</v>

108
00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.943
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to think squarespace for </v>
