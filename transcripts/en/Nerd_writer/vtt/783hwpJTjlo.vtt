00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.300
<v Speaker 1>Thomas pynchon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sprawling,</v>

2
00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.570
<v Speaker 1>epic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>postmodern novel gravity's Rainbow.</v>

3
00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:08.823
<v Speaker 1>There's a sequence in which the main </v>
<v Speaker 1>character is interrogated by the US </v>

4
00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.090
<v Speaker 1>government under the influence of Sodium</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amatol,</v>

5
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:21.300
<v Speaker 1>commonly called truth serum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The writing slips into several dreamlike</v>

6
00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:23.740
<v Speaker 1>rips on language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In one,</v>

7
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:24.633
<v Speaker 1>a telegram from Wisconsin launches the </v>
<v Speaker 1>main character into an obsessive </v>

8
00:00:28.241 --> 00:00:33.130
<v Speaker 1>meditation on the possible constructions</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a six word sequence.</v>

9
00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:34.563
<v Speaker 1>You never did the Kenosha kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As more and more examples are presented </v>

10
00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:40.143
<v Speaker 1>each with different punctuations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we become aware of a key postmodern </v>

11
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.220
<v Speaker 1>truth that words can point toward </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality,</v>

12
00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:49.503
<v Speaker 1>but they can never get there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They always mean different things in </v>

13
00:00:52.361 --> 00:00:56.380
<v Speaker 1>different contexts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just how many different contexts are</v>

14
00:00:56.381 --> 00:00:58.840
<v Speaker 1>there will pinch in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only gives us seven.</v>

15
00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.900
<v Speaker 1>There are far too many punctuation marks</v>
<v Speaker 1>and emphases,</v>

16
00:01:01.901 --> 00:01:02.734
<v Speaker 1>far too many combinations for a single </v>
<v Speaker 1>writer to catalog them all besides in </v>

17
00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.270
<v Speaker 1>the aesthetic universe of the novel.</v>

18
00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.290
<v Speaker 1>Cataloging them all would be exhaustive </v>
<v Speaker 1>and redundant.</v>

19
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.920
<v Speaker 1>Enter the Internet and a man named </v>
<v Speaker 1>Darrius Kazimir.</v>

20
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:20.023
<v Speaker 1>Hi everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He makes what he likes to call weird </v>

21
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.173
<v Speaker 1>Internet stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I make what I like to call weird </v>

22
00:01:25.131 --> 00:01:25.964
<v Speaker 1>Internet stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I recently come to accept is </v>

23
00:01:27.981 --> 00:01:29.570
<v Speaker 1>Internet art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Last year,</v>

24
00:01:29.571 --> 00:01:33.110
<v Speaker 1>Darrius made a twitter Bot that did what</v>
<v Speaker 1>the writer,</v>

25
00:01:33.111 --> 00:01:33.944
<v Speaker 1>Thomas Pynchon can't ever do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It automatically generates a different </v>

26
00:01:37.491 --> 00:01:38.324
<v Speaker 1>construction of the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You never did the Kenosha kids sequence </v>

27
00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.040
<v Speaker 1>every two hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as of this video,</v>

28
00:01:43.041 --> 00:01:43.874
<v Speaker 1>the account has already tweeted 8,600</v>
<v Speaker 1>times and with the number of </v>

29
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:48.763
<v Speaker 1>permutations possible could continue for</v>
<v Speaker 1>years without exhausting every one go </v>

30
00:01:53.271 --> 00:01:56.030
<v Speaker 1>there sometime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Try reading a few outloud.</v>

31
00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.250
<v Speaker 1>The effect of pensions language </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiment is compounded,</v>

32
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.120
<v Speaker 1>updated the truth that wants to </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate is received in a new way,</v>

33
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.253
<v Speaker 1>and the exhaustive list that would have </v>
<v Speaker 1>been inappropriate in a book is made </v>

34
00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.070
<v Speaker 1>novel and strangely vital in this new </v>
<v Speaker 1>form.</v>

35
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:14.503
<v Speaker 1>I think what this shows us is that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>aesthetics of Internet art of art made </v>

36
00:02:18.921 --> 00:02:19.754
<v Speaker 1>with and for and on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Internet won't conform to any that </v>

37
00:02:23.241 --> 00:02:24.074
<v Speaker 1>we've known before and that's fitting </v>
<v Speaker 1>because a lot of internet artists made </v>

38
00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:28.513
<v Speaker 1>unlike any art that came before it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because Amy's twitter bots aren't made </v>

39
00:02:32.091 --> 00:02:34.610
<v Speaker 1>with paint brushes or musical </v>
<v Speaker 1>instruments.</v>

40
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.920
<v Speaker 1>They're made with algorithms with code.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what the Kenosha kid twitter Bot</v>

41
00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.430
<v Speaker 1>really looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there any beauty in that,</v>

42
00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.910
<v Speaker 1>but what about this box?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

43
00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.950
<v Speaker 1>it's just a set of instructions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's what those instructions do.</v>

44
00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.780
<v Speaker 1>This programming rules perform a simple </v>
<v Speaker 1>task.</v>

45
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.913
<v Speaker 1>They access the Texas Department of </v>
<v Speaker 1>criminal justice and pull from the </v>

46
00:03:06.221 --> 00:03:07.054
<v Speaker 1>public.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Last word statements of death row </v>

47
00:03:09.251 --> 00:03:10.084
<v Speaker 1>inmates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any sentence that contains the word </v>

48
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.193
<v Speaker 1>love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This art piece isn't out to make an </v>

49
00:03:16.331 --> 00:03:18.850
<v Speaker 1>overtly political statement on capital </v>
<v Speaker 1>punishment,</v>

50
00:03:18.851 --> 00:03:19.684
<v Speaker 1>like all good art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This project organizes elements in the </v>

51
00:03:22.301 --> 00:03:26.470
<v Speaker 1>world around it to help an audience see </v>
<v Speaker 1>and feel in a new way.</v>

52
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.113
<v Speaker 1>The difference is that the World Kazemi </v>
<v Speaker 1>is commenting on it isn't the physical </v>

53
00:03:32.021 --> 00:03:34.390
<v Speaker 1>world not really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the digital world,</v>

54
00:03:34.391 --> 00:03:35.224
<v Speaker 1>the world of the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and indeed much of our digital internet </v>

55
00:03:37.991 --> 00:03:38.824
<v Speaker 1>art is focused on itself on the visible </v>
<v Speaker 1>and more importantly invisible aspects </v>

56
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.680
<v Speaker 1>of a network that's all around us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Computation is now everywhere.</v>

57
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.640
<v Speaker 1>It is lead of everything and we are </v>
<v Speaker 1>living inside that computer as well.</v>

58
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.820
<v Speaker 1>That's James Bridle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a critic and digital artists.</v>

59
00:03:54.821 --> 00:03:57.880
<v Speaker 1>Bridal did a project recently called </v>
<v Speaker 1>Rainbow planes,</v>

60
00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.923
<v Speaker 1>a project that started when he noticed </v>
<v Speaker 1>some odd artifacts from google earth of </v>

61
00:04:03.161 --> 00:04:06.010
<v Speaker 1>planes with rainbow after images.</v>

62
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.650
<v Speaker 1>It's a glitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

63
00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.020
<v Speaker 1>but like all true glitches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just a mistake,</v>

64
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.023
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of an opportunity to look </v>

65
00:04:13.151 --> 00:04:15.580
<v Speaker 1>through into the underlying systems that</v>
<v Speaker 1>produce this image.</v>

66
00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:16.443
<v Speaker 1>In this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it shows us that the satellites </v>

67
00:04:17.681 --> 00:04:20.920
<v Speaker 1>composing these images aren't using </v>
<v Speaker 1>cameras,</v>

68
00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.023
<v Speaker 1>but rather are collecting data from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>broad swath of the electromagnetic </v>

69
00:04:25.781 --> 00:04:28.600
<v Speaker 1>spectrum and they record red,</v>
<v Speaker 1>green and blue separately when they,</v>

70
00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:29.613
<v Speaker 1>when they make these data images.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so occasionally you find within </v>

71
00:04:31.691 --> 00:04:35.170
<v Speaker 1>satellite images these artifacts which </v>
<v Speaker 1>are produced by fast moving objects,</v>

72
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.500
<v Speaker 1>bridals digital art wants to help us see</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way technology sees us,</v>

73
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.033
<v Speaker 1>how hugely powerful systems have moved </v>
<v Speaker 1>slowly into our lives without much </v>

74
00:04:46.811 --> 00:04:50.110
<v Speaker 1>protest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These systems are not like us.</v>

75
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.990
<v Speaker 1>We see with eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they see with data,</v>

76
00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:54.183
<v Speaker 1>we think with mines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they think with algorithms aren't like </v>

77
00:04:57.221 --> 00:05:01.240
<v Speaker 1>this shows us that our increasing </v>
<v Speaker 1>dependence on sophisticated technologies</v>

78
00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:06.540
<v Speaker 1>comes at the cost of substituting our </v>
<v Speaker 1>values and our motives for theirs.</v>

79
00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:09.523
<v Speaker 1>So maybe the aesthetic value of Internet</v>
<v Speaker 1>art is measured by its ability to help </v>

80
00:05:12.951 --> 00:05:17.720
<v Speaker 1>us see the internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just as a novel can help us see language</v>

81
00:05:17.721 --> 00:05:18.554
<v Speaker 1>or an image can help us see reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just an idea and I can't say how </v>

82
00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.800
<v Speaker 1>valid it is for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think we do have to try to develop</v>

83
00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.690
<v Speaker 1>an aesthetic for this new digital art,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a way by which we can determine which of</v>

84
00:05:32.691 --> 00:05:35.530
<v Speaker 1>it is good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which of it is crap in which we consider</v>

85
00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:36.383
<v Speaker 1>truly essential because what we think is</v>
<v Speaker 1>great art speaks ultimately to what we </v>

86
00:05:41.421 --> 00:05:42.254
<v Speaker 1>think is valuable in culture and </v>
<v Speaker 1>articulating our values about the </v>

87
00:05:46.371 --> 00:05:47.204
<v Speaker 1>internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the global network in the years before </v>

88
00:05:49.311 --> 00:05:54.311
<v Speaker 1>it consumes everything might just be the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most important thing.</v>

89
00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.320
<v Speaker 1>Our generation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good effort to.</v>

90
00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:03.050
<v Speaker 1>Hey everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thanks for watching.</v>

91
00:06:03.051 --> 00:06:06.260
<v Speaker 1>Getting this in just before sunset here,</v>
