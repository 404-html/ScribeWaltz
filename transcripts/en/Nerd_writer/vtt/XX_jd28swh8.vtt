00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.133
<v Speaker 1>Another day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another 10th flog coffee on a Tuesday </v>

2
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.480
<v Speaker 1>and blog for.</v>

3
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.833
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's about stories I'm drawn to art </v>

4
00:00:19.181 --> 00:00:22.780
<v Speaker 1>forms that availed themselves of stories</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the development of character because</v>

5
00:00:22.781 --> 00:00:27.781
<v Speaker 1>I love hearing about how people choose </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get along in their century or less of</v>

6
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:28.843
<v Speaker 1>life within stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are genres and sub genres that I </v>

7
00:00:30.521 --> 00:00:31.354
<v Speaker 1>find particularly interesting because of</v>
<v Speaker 1>their capacities to eliminate certain </v>

8
00:00:34.211 --> 00:00:37.660
<v Speaker 1>parts of our experience that we may be </v>
<v Speaker 1>hiding from ourselves.</v>

9
00:00:37.661 --> 00:00:38.494
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe we tell ourselves that we're free </v>

10
00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.043
<v Speaker 1>in control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's a plan or a person guiding </v>

11
00:00:43.061 --> 00:00:44.680
<v Speaker 1>us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that reality is hard,</v>

12
00:00:44.681 --> 00:00:48.070
<v Speaker 1>like a stone and knowable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an important function of fiction to</v>

13
00:00:48.071 --> 00:00:50.950
<v Speaker 1>tear these things down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this vein,</v>

14
00:00:50.951 --> 00:00:55.450
<v Speaker 1>one of my favorite genres is cyberpunk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a projection of postmodernism,</v>

15
00:00:55.451 --> 00:00:56.284
<v Speaker 1>which is itself a refutation of general </v>
<v Speaker 1>theories and drawing heavily on science </v>

16
00:01:00.191 --> 00:01:01.024
<v Speaker 1>fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cyberpunk is a reaction to the </v>

17
00:01:02.651 --> 00:01:03.484
<v Speaker 1>information age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the age of the personal computer </v>

18
00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.080
<v Speaker 1>established in the work of William </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gibson's neuromancer series.</v>

19
00:01:08.081 --> 00:01:08.914
<v Speaker 1>Cyberpunk features the interaction of </v>
<v Speaker 1>high tech and low light as Lawrence </v>

20
00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:13.270
<v Speaker 1>Pearson describes it.</v>

21
00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.700
<v Speaker 1>Classic cyberpunk characters were </v>
<v Speaker 1>marginalized,</v>

22
00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:20.620
<v Speaker 1>alienated loners who lived on the edge </v>
<v Speaker 1>of society in generally dystopic futures</v>

23
00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:21.483
<v Speaker 1>were daily life was impacted by rapid </v>
<v Speaker 1>technological change and ubiquitous </v>

24
00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.350
<v Speaker 1>datasphere computerized information and </v>
<v Speaker 1>invasive modification of the human body.</v>

25
00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:30.213
<v Speaker 1>What makes cyber punk still compelling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think is that a lot of these things </v>

26
00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.000
<v Speaker 1>are already prevalent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Internet,</v>

27
00:01:34.001 --> 00:01:36.070
<v Speaker 1>social media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>artificial organs,</v>

28
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.933
<v Speaker 1>augmented reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and most recently the Google glass now </v>

29
00:01:39.041 --> 00:01:41.680
<v Speaker 1>that our future will become dystopic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

30
00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:42.573
<v Speaker 1>that's a stretch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is fiction and I don't think </v>

31
00:01:44.441 --> 00:01:47.790
<v Speaker 1>it's really the point of science fiction</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be predicted.</v>

32
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.633
<v Speaker 1>There's a deeper level in cyber punk and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that it's captured best in the </v>

33
00:01:51.641 --> 00:01:52.474
<v Speaker 1>film blade runner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think cinema is uniquely suited to </v>

34
00:01:54.341 --> 00:01:57.640
<v Speaker 1>cyber punk because it has the advantages</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the visual and auditory,</v>

35
00:01:57.641 --> 00:01:58.474
<v Speaker 1>the neon moving lights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the little ting longing music of the </v>

36
00:02:01.181 --> 00:02:02.014
<v Speaker 1>brilliant Vangelis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean as soon as that first note goes </v>

37
00:02:03.791 --> 00:02:07.180
<v Speaker 1>bad and the brilliant score to blade </v>
<v Speaker 1>runner before the credits or even over,</v>

38
00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.940
<v Speaker 1>you know exactly what the movie is going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to convey here.</v>

39
00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:10.803
<v Speaker 1>Just take alice</v>

40
00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.570
<v Speaker 1>gives me chills every time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blade runner's meticulous,</v>

41
00:02:38.571 --> 00:02:39.404
<v Speaker 1>romanticization of cyber punk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think is key to understanding its </v>

42
00:02:41.661 --> 00:02:43.730
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that the breakdown in the social</v>

43
00:02:43.731 --> 00:02:45.470
<v Speaker 1>order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the overload of information,</v>

44
00:02:45.471 --> 00:02:46.304
<v Speaker 1>the sheer size and incomprehensibility </v>
<v Speaker 1>of this kind of dystopia appeals to an </v>

45
00:02:50.841 --> 00:02:54.470
<v Speaker 1>important part in every one of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the desire to surrender,</v>

46
00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.590
<v Speaker 1>to succumb to the quite apparent truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that everything means nothing.</v>

47
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:00.663
<v Speaker 1>It's my idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I admit that it's a controversial </v>

48
00:03:02.021 --> 00:03:05.470
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that everyone furtively understands that</v>

49
00:03:05.471 --> 00:03:09.220
<v Speaker 1>life is meaningless despite what they </v>
<v Speaker 1>profess to believe in public,</v>

50
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:14.820
<v Speaker 1>and that a moderated submission to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos is in fact profoundly healthy.</v>

51
00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.650
<v Speaker 1>Key word moderate cyberpunk allows us </v>
<v Speaker 1>away into this part of ourselves.</v>

52
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.370
<v Speaker 1>It reflects loneliness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the evasion of responsibility,</v>

53
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.970
<v Speaker 1>and the severe impotence of man in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mouth of the universe.</v>

54
00:03:27.971 --> 00:03:31.060
<v Speaker 1>It makes chumps that of scientists and </v>
<v Speaker 1>dogmatists alike,</v>

55
00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:32.223
<v Speaker 1>and though it tears down the walls I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>built to protect myself from the </v>

56
00:03:34.901 --> 00:03:35.734
<v Speaker 1>largeness of nihilism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's at the same time a feeling of </v>

57
00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.420
<v Speaker 1>loveliness as if I was listening to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>gentle song</v>

58
00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.120
<v Speaker 2>and when the note turned</v>

59
00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:48.443
<v Speaker 3>had melted.</v>

60
00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.710
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for staying with me through 40</v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks of blogs.</v>
