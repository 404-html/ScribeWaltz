1
00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:03.583
<v Speaker 1>We have to admit there's something </v>
<v Speaker 1>insidious and detestable about late </v>

2
00:00:06.771 --> 00:00:09.110
<v Speaker 1>night television,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kind of vicious circle.</v>

3
00:00:09.111 --> 00:00:09.944
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to realize until you actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>go to a taping and the warmup comedian </v>

4
00:00:13.031 --> 00:00:17.330
<v Speaker 1>gauges your laugh on a one to 10 volume </v>
<v Speaker 1>scale and instructs you that you're only</v>

5
00:00:17.331 --> 00:00:18.164
<v Speaker 1>at about a seven and you need to keep it</v>
<v Speaker 1>up and turn it up for every little joke </v>

6
00:00:20.901 --> 00:00:21.734
<v Speaker 1>you're about to see because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>microphones are way up in the ceiling </v>

7
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:24.463
<v Speaker 1>and they won't hear you otherwise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It begins to dawn on you after about 10 </v>

8
00:00:27.081 --> 00:00:27.914
<v Speaker 1>cheerless guffaws that you came to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>taping because you thought the show was </v>

9
00:00:31.521 --> 00:00:32.354
<v Speaker 1>funny and you thought the show was funny</v>
<v Speaker 1>because all the jokes were followed by </v>

10
00:00:35.481 --> 00:00:36.314
<v Speaker 1>maps and cheers and the lapse in cheers </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're forced to make are what's causing </v>

11
00:00:40.371 --> 00:00:41.204
<v Speaker 1>the audience at home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To think the show is funny and it's why </v>

12
00:00:43.671 --> 00:00:45.380
<v Speaker 1>they want to come to the taping </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>

13
00:00:45.381 --> 00:00:48.650
<v Speaker 1>which they do and they laugh and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cycle begins.</v>

14
00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.510
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>disappointing as this is.</v>

15
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:51.523
<v Speaker 1>It's also truly absurd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A self generating observed that appears </v>

16
00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:56.383
<v Speaker 1>normal to us because it's all we know </v>
<v Speaker 1>and if a really smart and innovative </v>

17
00:01:00.171 --> 00:01:01.004
<v Speaker 1>comedian wanted to draw attention to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>normalization of this absurd American </v>

18
00:01:04.971 --> 00:01:05.804
<v Speaker 1>ritual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps the first thing to do would be </v>

19
00:01:07.731 --> 00:01:11.840
<v Speaker 1>to grab hold of the absurdity and turn </v>
<v Speaker 1>it way.</v>

20
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:13.063
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the biggest job I've ever seen </v>

21
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:30.403
<v Speaker 2>and I don't think this is the right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to keep going with this and </v>

22
00:01:34.351 --> 00:01:37.960
<v Speaker 2>we're going to see when we hit the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pixelation,</v>

23
00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.840
<v Speaker 2>the only unmarried looking for love life</v>
<v Speaker 2>was passing me by,</v>

24
00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.560
<v Speaker 2>so I sent off my four two hobbies and </v>
<v Speaker 2>age magazine,</v>

25
00:01:54.561 --> 00:01:55.394
<v Speaker 2>marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try to read his lovely Japanese girls </v>

26
00:01:58.611 --> 00:02:00.920
<v Speaker 2>have been trained in the art of fees in </v>
<v Speaker 2>men.</v>

27
00:02:00.921 --> 00:02:03.980
<v Speaker 2>Be Lonely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no more open destinies for $1.</v>

28
00:02:03.981 --> 00:02:06.260
<v Speaker 2>They arrange a meeting for 10 years</v>

29
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.133
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The brilliant Craig Ferguson has lit a </v>

30
00:02:08.771 --> 00:02:11.020
<v Speaker 1>fire from within the late night talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>show universe.</v>

31
00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.720
<v Speaker 1>Systematically deconstructing all its </v>
<v Speaker 1>elements,</v>

32
00:02:13.721 --> 00:02:16.540
<v Speaker 1>whether it's the deferential sidekick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the live band,</v>

33
00:02:16.541 --> 00:02:18.970
<v Speaker 1>with the pre interview.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More than any,</v>

34
00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.060
<v Speaker 1>the preinterview means nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means nothing.</v>

35
00:02:22.061 --> 00:02:22.894
<v Speaker 1>It's meaningless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The pre interviews a formality like </v>

36
00:02:24.521 --> 00:02:25.354
<v Speaker 1>wearing a tie or underpants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seemed like the biggest enemy to </v>

37
00:02:27.911 --> 00:02:28.744
<v Speaker 1>Ferguson sense of comedy was the very </v>
<v Speaker 1>foundation of late night TV structure </v>

38
00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.913
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

39
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.150
<v Speaker 2>Ferguson.</v>

40
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.430
<v Speaker 1>We sought out the unrehearsed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the spontaneous.</v>

41
00:02:44.431 --> 00:02:46.560
<v Speaker 1>He encouraged the awkward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the weird,</v>

42
00:02:46.561 --> 00:02:50.410
<v Speaker 1>the difficult to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should start rehearsing and recognize</v>

43
00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.263
<v Speaker 1>and despise late nights deification of </v>
<v Speaker 1>celebrity and took every opportunity to </v>

44
00:02:55.471 --> 00:02:56.930
<v Speaker 1>mock us for buying into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

45
00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.620
<v Speaker 1>it's a short time on this planet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

46
00:02:58.621 --> 00:02:59.950
<v Speaker 1>It's a date and then a hyphen</v>

47
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.440
<v Speaker 2>and then another day and we have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hyphen and I'm like,</v>

48
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm not spending the whole time talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>celebrities.</v>

49
00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.330
<v Speaker 2>Now this isn't to say that</v>

50
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:09.183
<v Speaker 1>that hosts like Jimmy Fallon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who I do like is somehow bankrupt </v>

51
00:03:11.861 --> 00:03:12.694
<v Speaker 1>because all he does is pay homage to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>format by putting it in terms young </v>

52
00:03:16.181 --> 00:03:17.014
<v Speaker 1>people of today can understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just that he and Ferguson sit at </v>

53
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.550
<v Speaker 1>opposite ends of the spectrum or rather </v>
<v Speaker 1>ferguson more than anyone else.</v>

54
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:25.473
<v Speaker 1>Willingly places himself outside the </v>
<v Speaker 1>spectrum and his relationship to late </v>

55
00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.950
<v Speaker 1>night is an altogether different quality</v>
<v Speaker 1>or revolutionary one.</v>

56
00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.100
<v Speaker 2>Americans not here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to lift the Dragon Tattoo.</v>

57
00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.843
<v Speaker 2>The tension between</v>

58
00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.390
<v Speaker 1>Ferguson and late night was what made </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ferguson so funny.</v>

59
00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.480
<v Speaker 1>His ability to express contempt for his </v>
<v Speaker 1>position,</v>

60
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:50.890
<v Speaker 1>his network,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his job,</v>

61
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.300
<v Speaker 1>his willingness to admit his failures to</v>
<v Speaker 1>dwell on it was for many of us,</v>

62
00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:56.163
<v Speaker 1>extremely liberating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's because late night tv is a </v>

63
00:03:59.081 --> 00:04:01.120
<v Speaker 1>fantasy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fantasy of sophistication,</v>

64
00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.600
<v Speaker 1>charm and fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A standard to which after enough time we</v>

65
00:04:04.601 --> 00:04:05.434
<v Speaker 1>hold ourselves unwittingly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one knew this better than Craig </v>

66
00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.490
<v Speaker 1>Ferguson for 10 fucking awesome fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>weird years.</v>

67
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:13.473
<v Speaker 1>He tried to show us that life bears far </v>
<v Speaker 1>less resemblance to a string of funny </v>

68
00:04:17.321 --> 00:04:22.150
<v Speaker 1>stories than to the long awkward pauses </v>
<v Speaker 1>that exists between,</v>

69
00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.390
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope we've done is.</v>

70
00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:56.250
<v Speaker 2>It is maybe a to maybe art is a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>grand word,</v>

71
00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.060
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

72
00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.893
<v Speaker 2>but what I was trying to do here and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what I think that we've managed to do </v>

73
00:05:01.681 --> 00:05:02.514
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

74
00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:04.370
<v Speaker 3>make something that wasn't here before</v>

75
00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.900
<v Speaker 2>all I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like chocolate milk.</v>

76
00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.620
<v Speaker 2>Chocolate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dark chocolate is in.</v>

77
00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:13.540
<v Speaker 2>You didn't lie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You didn't want them.</v>

78
00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:14.783
<v Speaker 2>You didn't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Robot someone who creates them his own </v>

79
00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:22.443
<v Speaker 2>chocolate.</v>
