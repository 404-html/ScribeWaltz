1
00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.450
<v Speaker 1>Here's a question for aspiring </v>
<v Speaker 1>screenwriters.</v>

2
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:04.673
<v Speaker 1>Is it possible to make the movie </v>
<v Speaker 1>passengers better with some relatively </v>

3
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.470
<v Speaker 1>minor changes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:11.363
<v Speaker 1>I don't think this is a really bad film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After hearing reviews from friends and </v>

5
00:00:14.461 --> 00:00:16.500
<v Speaker 1>online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sort of expected it to be,</v>

6
00:00:16.501 --> 00:00:18.840
<v Speaker 1>but I think that feeling was mostly </v>
<v Speaker 1>disappointed.</v>

7
00:00:18.841 --> 00:00:21.930
<v Speaker 1>Expectation passengers is by no means a </v>
<v Speaker 1>train wreck.</v>

8
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.530
<v Speaker 1>It's just really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really predictable to the plot goes like</v>

9
00:00:25.531 --> 00:00:27.210
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After the interstellar spaceship,</v>

10
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.930
<v Speaker 1>avalon malfunctions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris Pratt wakes up from hyper sleep 90</v>

11
00:00:30.931 --> 00:00:34.470
<v Speaker 1>years before he supposed to 90 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>before anyone else on the ship.</v>

12
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.633
<v Speaker 1>You can't go back to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't contact her if you can't get </v>

13
00:00:37.801 --> 00:00:38.634
<v Speaker 1>to the ship's controls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He tries to do all of these things and </v>

14
00:00:40.531 --> 00:00:42.270
<v Speaker 1>fails.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a year passes.</v>

15
00:00:42.271 --> 00:00:43.104
<v Speaker 1>He grows increasingly sad and hopeless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so eventually he decides to wake up </v>

16
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.633
<v Speaker 1>another passenger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jennifer Lawrence condemning her to the </v>

17
00:00:49.561 --> 00:00:50.394
<v Speaker 1>same fate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially death in order to give </v>

18
00:00:52.051 --> 00:00:53.460
<v Speaker 1>himself some more company.</v>

19
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.000
<v Speaker 1>He acts like gets another malfunction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't tell her after a while,</v>

20
00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.930
<v Speaker 1>they fall in love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She finds out the truth gets really mad,</v>

21
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.450
<v Speaker 1>and then the ship begins to really </v>
<v Speaker 1>malfunctioned.</v>

22
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.313
<v Speaker 1>So Pratt sacrifices himself to save it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the end she saves him a fall in </v>

23
00:01:08.221 --> 00:01:09.054
<v Speaker 1>love again and spend the rest of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives alone on the ship happily ever </v>

24
00:01:12.301 --> 00:01:12.991
<v Speaker 1>after.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

25
00:01:12.991 --> 00:01:17.991
<v Speaker 1>and Laurence Fishburne send it to about </v>
<v Speaker 1>12 or 13 minutes and act three,</v>

26
00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.010
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>count your blessings.</v>

27
00:01:20.011 --> 00:01:22.920
<v Speaker 1>It's way better than what Oscar </v>
<v Speaker 1>nominated actor Andy Garcia got.</v>

28
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.550
<v Speaker 1>So you can break this blood up into five</v>
<v Speaker 1>basic turning points.</v>

29
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.413
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris Wakes up to Chris Wakes Jennifer </v>

30
00:01:29.351 --> 00:01:30.210
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three,</v>

31
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.230
<v Speaker 1>she finds out for Chris Sacrifices </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself and five,</v>

32
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.183
<v Speaker 1>she forgives him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The most acute tension in the film </v>

33
00:01:36.991 --> 00:01:37.824
<v Speaker 1>happens between parts two and three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When Jennifer starts to fall in love </v>

34
00:01:40.411 --> 00:01:42.480
<v Speaker 1>with Chris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but doesn't yet know the truth.</v>

35
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.210
<v Speaker 1>We know the truth is coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a little dramatic irony there.</v>

36
00:01:45.211 --> 00:01:49.350
<v Speaker 1>And so we wait with increasing anxiety </v>
<v Speaker 1>until it does and when it does,</v>

37
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.213
<v Speaker 1>predictably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jennifer freaks out predictably and we </v>

38
00:01:52.471 --> 00:01:55.080
<v Speaker 1>feel a little sadness predictably at </v>
<v Speaker 1>this point,</v>

39
00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.973
<v Speaker 1>exactly an hour into the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The script has sort of written itself </v>

40
00:01:58.741 --> 00:01:59.574
<v Speaker 1>into a corner because Pratt is the real </v>
<v Speaker 1>main character because we spend 30 </v>

41
00:02:02.791 --> 00:02:03.624
<v Speaker 1>minutes alone with him at the start of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the film and see everything through his </v>

42
00:02:06.061 --> 00:02:06.894
<v Speaker 1>eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's really only two paths to take </v>

43
00:02:08.761 --> 00:02:09.594
<v Speaker 1>regarding the central relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Either he dies or she forgives him in </v>

44
00:02:14.071 --> 00:02:14.904
<v Speaker 1>both ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He finds APP solution for the sin he </v>

45
00:02:16.621 --> 00:02:20.220
<v Speaker 1>committed because you're not going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>able to turn him bad.</v>

46
00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.123
<v Speaker 1>Not a character like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not unless you have five seasons to do </v>

47
00:02:23.911 --> 00:02:24.631
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yes,</v>

48
00:02:24.631 --> 00:02:26.700
<v Speaker 1>I know there are some illusions to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>shining here,</v>

49
00:02:26.701 --> 00:02:27.534
<v Speaker 1>put the shining,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spent pretty much no time at all and </v>

50
00:02:29.321 --> 00:02:31.440
<v Speaker 1>deering us to the character of Jack </v>
<v Speaker 1>Torrance.</v>

51
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.620
<v Speaker 1>Passenger spends the whole first act and</v>
<v Speaker 1>during us to the lovable,</v>

52
00:02:34.621 --> 00:02:35.880
<v Speaker 1>scrappy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris Pratt.</v>

53
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.690
<v Speaker 1>It's clear the creators or the studio </v>
<v Speaker 1>were intent on this being a love story,</v>

54
00:02:39.691 --> 00:02:41.850
<v Speaker 1>so they chose to go with the schmaltzy </v>
<v Speaker 1>ending,</v>

55
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.630
<v Speaker 1>but they could have chosen either the </v>
<v Speaker 1>last 45 minutes would have been the same</v>

56
00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:46.543
<v Speaker 1>movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty much devoid of real tension or </v>

57
00:02:48.361 --> 00:02:49.194
<v Speaker 1>suspense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which requires a completely new plot </v>

58
00:02:51.031 --> 00:02:52.200
<v Speaker 1>device.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the third act.</v>

59
00:02:52.201 --> 00:02:54.480
<v Speaker 1>The total malfunction of the ship to </v>
<v Speaker 1>juice,</v>

60
00:02:54.481 --> 00:02:56.430
<v Speaker 1>the ending with some adrenaline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

61
00:02:56.431 --> 00:02:59.380
<v Speaker 1>a couple of weeks ago I was watching </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris Sztokman and Doug Walkers,</v>

62
00:02:59.381 --> 00:03:00.214
<v Speaker 1>joint review of passengers and Walker </v>
<v Speaker 1>said something interesting if they told </v>

63
00:03:03.621 --> 00:03:05.360
<v Speaker 1>this in a different order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

64
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.440
<v Speaker 1>When have been 10 times more </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

65
00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.720
<v Speaker 1>The thing I began to wonder is what if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you rearrange the movie so that Jennifer</v>

66
00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:15.910
<v Speaker 1>Lawrence was the point of view </v>
<v Speaker 1>character,</v>

67
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.193
<v Speaker 1>not Chris Pratt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if the film began with her </v>

68
00:03:19.841 --> 00:03:21.040
<v Speaker 1>experience?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

69
00:03:21.041 --> 00:03:24.430
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't stop thinking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I re edited the existing footage.</v>

70
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.790
<v Speaker 1>See what would happen to the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good morning,</v>

71
00:03:41.611 --> 00:03:43.050
<v Speaker 1>Aurora.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How are you feeling?</v>

72
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.350
<v Speaker 1>You just spent 120 years of suspended </v>
<v Speaker 1>animation.</v>

73
00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:50.930
<v Speaker 1>Grand Concourse.</v>

74
00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.830
<v Speaker 2>Anybody?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hello?</v>

75
00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.260
<v Speaker 2>Hi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he passenger or crew passenger?</v>

76
00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.330
<v Speaker 2>Jim Preston.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what's going on?</v>

77
00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.500
<v Speaker 2>Nobody else from my Robo Cup.</v>

78
00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.240
<v Speaker 1>Same for me when I made this change and </v>
<v Speaker 1>just watched from there some interesting</v>

79
00:04:21.241 --> 00:04:23.430
<v Speaker 1>things started to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

80
00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.090
<v Speaker 1>the first act changes its tone entirely </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the original first act.</v>

81
00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.280
<v Speaker 1>You're wandering around the ship with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris Pratt.</v>

82
00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:30.443
<v Speaker 1>You learn cool things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see him come to terms with the </v>

83
00:04:32.191 --> 00:04:33.720
<v Speaker 1>situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have fun,</v>

84
00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:34.613
<v Speaker 1>get depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and finally reached the ethical dilemma </v>

85
00:04:36.571 --> 00:04:40.530
<v Speaker 1>that's meant to animate the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you see is what you get here,</v>

86
00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.650
<v Speaker 1>which makes for a somewhat passive </v>
<v Speaker 1>viewing experience.</v>

87
00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:44.813
<v Speaker 1>It's an amazing sequence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's mostly down to cool </v>

88
00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.510
<v Speaker 1>production design and pratts always </v>
<v Speaker 1>charming performance.</v>

89
00:04:49.511 --> 00:04:52.320
<v Speaker 1>I guess I am going to die of old age on </v>
<v Speaker 1>this ship,</v>

90
00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.490
<v Speaker 1>but in the new first act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the story is infused from the start with</v>

91
00:04:56.491 --> 00:04:58.770
<v Speaker 1>mystery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I made the editing changes,</v>

92
00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.000
<v Speaker 1>I was genuinely surprised by just how </v>
<v Speaker 1>creepy pratts character is.</v>

93
00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:04.013
<v Speaker 1>When you take away his point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't know whether to trust him or </v>

94
00:05:06.841 --> 00:05:08.070
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe him or not,</v>

95
00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:09.083
<v Speaker 1>and that makes the audience's experience</v>
<v Speaker 1>an active one in every moment to you </v>

96
00:05:12.541 --> 00:05:15.440
<v Speaker 1>know what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody else from my robot</v>

97
00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:16.323
<v Speaker 2>cut.</v>

98
00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:18.213
<v Speaker 1>Same for me as he leads Jennifer around </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ship locations become crime scenes </v>

99
00:05:22.121 --> 00:05:24.550
<v Speaker 1>where the viewer tries to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's happening.</v>

100
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:25.600
<v Speaker 1>This of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

101
00:05:25.601 --> 00:05:28.000
<v Speaker 1>is what makes Andrei Tarkovsky Solara so</v>
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

102
00:05:28.001 --> 00:05:28.834
<v Speaker 1>So much has happened on Solaris by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time the lead character arrives that he </v>

103
00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.070
<v Speaker 1>and the audience have to piece the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fragments together themselves.</v>

104
00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just look at how creepy he is.</v>

105
00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:39.003
<v Speaker 1>I actually think that pratts performance</v>
<v Speaker 1>takes on more dimensions from this </v>

106
00:05:41.621 --> 00:05:42.454
<v Speaker 1>angle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not always forced to see him as </v>

107
00:05:43.451 --> 00:05:44.284
<v Speaker 1>sympathetic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so his darker side comes out in greater </v>

108
00:05:45.971 --> 00:05:47.440
<v Speaker 1>relief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More important than that.</v>

109
00:05:47.441 --> 00:05:48.274
<v Speaker 1>That dark choice that sits at the heart </v>
<v Speaker 1>of this film hits with greater impact </v>

110
00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:54.340
<v Speaker 1>when seen from the first time from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lawrence's perspective,</v>

111
00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:58.220
<v Speaker 1>because we feel the cruelty as she feels</v>
<v Speaker 1>it too to your wake me up.</v>

112
00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:01.483
<v Speaker 1>I try not to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now we're at the point where the </v>

113
00:06:05.241 --> 00:06:08.660
<v Speaker 1>original story hits that dead end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with this new edit,</v>

114
00:06:08.661 --> 00:06:12.140
<v Speaker 1>you have some more options to play with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Namely with this configuration,</v>

115
00:06:12.141 --> 00:06:14.510
<v Speaker 1>you could actually turn Pratt into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>villain.</v>

116
00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:15.373
<v Speaker 1>The original film suggests that can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>follow through on and make passengers </v>

117
00:06:18.981 --> 00:06:22.670
<v Speaker 1>into the thriller horror film that so </v>
<v Speaker 1>many critics wanted to see.</v>

118
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:23.713
<v Speaker 1>You could even cut back in that whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>first section of Chris's time alone on </v>

119
00:06:26.481 --> 00:06:27.314
<v Speaker 1>the ship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but put it after the revelation without </v>

120
00:06:29.361 --> 00:06:32.900
<v Speaker 1>the need to justify his good guidance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could show a deeper,</v>

121
00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:33.763
<v Speaker 1>more desperate side to his loneliness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something that I think actually would </v>

122
00:06:36.591 --> 00:06:41.300
<v Speaker 1>make him more sympathetic in the end and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the choice he makes more agonizing.</v>

123
00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:00.003
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the simple cut and paste doesn't solve </v>

124
00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:03.910
<v Speaker 1>every problem in the script.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ending,</v>

125
00:07:03.911 --> 00:07:05.440
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's still an issue.</v>

126
00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:08.260
<v Speaker 1>I think you'd want to remove the </v>
<v Speaker 1>malfunction macguffin,</v>

127
00:07:08.261 --> 00:07:12.370
<v Speaker 1>but it might be just as trite to close </v>
<v Speaker 1>the story and true horror fashion.</v>

128
00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:16.090
<v Speaker 1>It could be cool to give it a twilight </v>
<v Speaker 1>zone ending as Peter Spread at slashfilm</v>

129
00:07:16.091 --> 00:07:20.710
<v Speaker 1>suggested and have di and Lawrence get </v>
<v Speaker 1>so lonely that she begins to contemplate</v>

130
00:07:20.711 --> 00:07:21.544
<v Speaker 1>the same horrible choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brainstorming like this is obviously </v>

131
00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:25.383
<v Speaker 1>really fun and much easier than actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>writing a movie and making one for all </v>

132
00:07:28.631 --> 00:07:29.464
<v Speaker 1>its faults.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Passengers is a big budget movie with a </v>

133
00:07:30.941 --> 00:07:31.774
<v Speaker 1>completely original script and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be celebrated because it's a </v>

134
00:07:34.931 --> 00:07:36.460
<v Speaker 1>dying breed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if I'm like,</v>

135
00:07:36.461 --> 00:07:37.294
<v Speaker 1>this is a good opportunity for would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>screenwriters to think about story </v>

136
00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:41.343
<v Speaker 1>because you can learn just as much from </v>
<v Speaker 1>films that don't work as you can from </v>

137
00:07:44.891 --> 00:07:45.724
<v Speaker 1>those that do.</v>

138

141

<v Speaker 1>it can get really scruffy really </v>
