1
00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:03.880
<v Speaker 1>Coffee on a Tuesday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Flanagan second.</v>

2
00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:05.240
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3
00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:06.380
<v Speaker 1>I thought I could just do</v>

4
00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:20.870
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you've had this experience before.</v>

5
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:21.733
<v Speaker 1>You were dreaming something terrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>like you were a little child and your </v>

6
00:00:23.631 --> 00:00:26.960
<v Speaker 1>mother was yelling at you or a giant </v>
<v Speaker 1>evil baby was chasing you or you saw the</v>

7
00:00:26.961 --> 00:00:28.550
<v Speaker 1>death of your wife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever it is,</v>

8
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.190
<v Speaker 1>you wake up feeling like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You say to yourself,</v>

9
00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.040
<v Speaker 1>this is going to be a shitty day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just have a feeling.</v>

10
00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:34.903
<v Speaker 1>Then getting out of the shower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you slip and fall and layer you trip on </v>

11
00:00:36.951 --> 00:00:40.910
<v Speaker 1>the sidewalk and spill your coffee </v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere and then you do it again.</v>

12
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.700
<v Speaker 1>Your friend calls you and says she can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>make it for lunch.</v>

13
00:00:43.701 --> 00:00:44.534
<v Speaker 1>Your job application comes back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rejected you burn your hand on the </v>

14
00:00:46.521 --> 00:00:48.290
<v Speaker 1>stove.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no toilet paper.</v>

15
00:00:48.291 --> 00:00:51.320
<v Speaker 1>Desperate housewives is a repeat and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to bed thinking,</v>

16
00:00:51.321 --> 00:00:54.320
<v Speaker 1>what a shitty day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew it was gonna be shit.</v>

17
00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.390
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we can see right here that there</v>

18
00:00:56.391 --> 00:00:57.224
<v Speaker 1>was nothing in the physical universe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is guaranteeing a bad day for our </v>

19
00:00:59.901 --> 00:01:00.530
<v Speaker 1>friend Justin.</v>

20
00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:01.363
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the universe doesn't care what kind of </v>

21
00:01:02.121 --> 00:01:02.954
<v Speaker 1>data is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just another rotation of 360 </v>

22
00:01:04.341 --> 00:01:05.174
<v Speaker 1>degrees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's here that Justin decides and </v>

23
00:01:06.201 --> 00:01:07.034
<v Speaker 1>all his infinite wisdom that he's going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to make a prediction about the day to </v>

24
00:01:09.921 --> 00:01:14.120
<v Speaker 1>day is going to be bad and all that bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff really does happen,</v>

25
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.073
<v Speaker 1>so going to bed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Justin believes that his prediction was </v>

26
00:01:17.421 --> 00:01:18.254
<v Speaker 1>dead on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is called a self fulfilling </v>

27
00:01:19.311 --> 00:01:21.590
<v Speaker 1>prophecy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a false definition of the situation,</v>

28
00:01:21.591 --> 00:01:22.424
<v Speaker 1>evoking new behavior which makes the </v>
<v Speaker 1>originally false definition come </v>

29
00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.500
<v Speaker 1>consciously or unconsciously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Justin created his own bad day,</v>

30
00:01:28.501 --> 00:01:29.334
<v Speaker 1>but he's no different than any of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Self fulfilling prophecies are </v>

31
00:01:30.681 --> 00:01:31.514
<v Speaker 1>inexorably weaved into all of our lives </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we go through life thinking that </v>

32
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.530
<v Speaker 1>this is going to be a bad day or I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely going to get this job or that</v>

33
00:01:36.531 --> 00:01:39.050
<v Speaker 1>student's going to do really well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or these banks are in trouble,</v>

34
00:01:39.051 --> 00:01:40.940
<v Speaker 1>so I withdraw my money just to be safe.</v>

35
00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:41.803
<v Speaker 1>In every example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>false definitions lead to real outcomes </v>

36
00:01:43.641 --> 00:01:44.474
<v Speaker 1>like a bad day or a good job or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>straight a student or a global </v>

37
00:01:48.381 --> 00:01:49.940
<v Speaker 1>recession,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the concept is old.</v>

38
00:01:49.941 --> 00:01:51.680
<v Speaker 1>See oedipus Macbeth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Star Wars,</v>

39
00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.830
<v Speaker 1>but the idea of self fulfilling prophecy</v>
<v Speaker 1>has much deeper connotations.</v>

40
00:01:54.831 --> 00:01:55.664
<v Speaker 1>Then Justin's bad day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Each and every one of our identities </v>

41
00:01:58.191 --> 00:02:01.280
<v Speaker 1>comes into existence by way of them as </v>
<v Speaker 1>cute little infants.</v>

42
00:02:01.281 --> 00:02:03.590
<v Speaker 1>We are psychologically no different from</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>

43
00:02:03.591 --> 00:02:06.580
<v Speaker 1>We react to the stimuli around us based </v>
<v Speaker 1>on genetic program.</v>

44
00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.470
<v Speaker 1>We have no sense of meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no sense of ourselves,</v>

45
00:02:09.471 --> 00:02:10.640
<v Speaker 1>no identity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as babies.</v>

46
00:02:10.641 --> 00:02:12.200
<v Speaker 1>Our parents don't treat us like animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

47
00:02:12.201 --> 00:02:14.000
<v Speaker 1>they treat us like we do have </v>
<v Speaker 1>identities.</v>

48
00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:14.834
<v Speaker 1>They talked to us like we can understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're saying and what they're </v>

49
00:02:17.151 --> 00:02:22.151
<v Speaker 1>saying is basically this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we love you and you are there.</v>

50
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.520
<v Speaker 1>They show us what it is to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognized.</v>

51
00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.620
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in order for that recognition to blossom</v>

52
00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:28.483
<v Speaker 1>into a self,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the baby has to be courageous to risk </v>

53
00:02:31.851 --> 00:02:35.020
<v Speaker 1>that first communication,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mom or a dad.</v>

54
00:02:35.021 --> 00:02:35.854
<v Speaker 1>The edit is a risk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The self is a very tumultuous thing to </v>

55
00:02:37.971 --> 00:02:40.370
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's much easier just to stay silent,</v>

56
00:02:40.371 --> 00:02:42.860
<v Speaker 1>but those good parents have been very </v>
<v Speaker 1>encouraging,</v>

57
00:02:42.861 --> 00:02:43.694
<v Speaker 1>will love you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No matter what they say will apply to </v>

58
00:02:46.191 --> 00:02:49.430
<v Speaker 1>you or mirror you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can trust in this way.</v>

59
00:02:49.431 --> 00:02:50.264
<v Speaker 1>Parents create their children's </v>
<v Speaker 1>identities by way of self fulfilling </v>

60
00:02:52.731 --> 00:02:53.564
<v Speaker 1>prophecy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They predict the identity and then </v>

61
00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.440
<v Speaker 1>organize their behavior so as to bring </v>
<v Speaker 1>it about and the more loving the parent,</v>

62
00:02:59.441 --> 00:03:01.480
<v Speaker 1>the more courageous the baby will be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

63
00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:02.314
<v Speaker 1>the self is not a prize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It needs to be worked on all the time </v>

64
00:03:04.631 --> 00:03:07.970
<v Speaker 1>and this too is a constant process of </v>
<v Speaker 1>self fulfilling prophecy.</v>

65
00:03:07.971 --> 00:03:08.804
<v Speaker 1>Social reality is very flexible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's subject to a variety of </v>

66
00:03:10.961 --> 00:03:11.650
<v Speaker 1>interpretations.</v>

67
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:12.483
<v Speaker 1>We define the world and our place in it </v>
<v Speaker 1>every single day and as it was our </v>

68
00:03:15.341 --> 00:03:17.320
<v Speaker 1>parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we literally created our identities.</v>

69
00:03:17.321 --> 00:03:22.030
<v Speaker 1>Our conception of how they see us </v>
<v Speaker 1>remains a huge part of ourselves like it</v>

70
00:03:22.031 --> 00:03:22.864
<v Speaker 1>or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's the same with friends and </v>

71
00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:25.513
<v Speaker 1>lovers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are all continuously creating one </v>

72
00:03:26.861 --> 00:03:29.920
<v Speaker 1>another's identities and it's all self </v>
<v Speaker 1>fulfilling prophecy.</v>

73
00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.210
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Justin had a bad day.</v>

74
00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:34.510
<v Speaker 1>There's no question about that and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was self fulfilling prophecy,</v>

75
00:03:34.511 --> 00:03:35.344
<v Speaker 1>but one thing you didn't see was when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>called him after the desperate </v>

76
00:03:37.811 --> 00:03:38.644
<v Speaker 1>housewives disappointment and told them </v>
<v Speaker 1>about my own shitty day and listen to </v>

77
00:03:41.621 --> 00:03:43.540
<v Speaker 1>his getting off the phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

78
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:44.560
<v Speaker 1>don't worry about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>buddy.</v>

79
00:03:44.561 --> 00:03:45.394
<v Speaker 1>Shit happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can always vent to me because </v>

80
00:03:46.901 --> 00:03:48.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure as hell can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've vent to you.</v>

81
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.370
<v Speaker 1>He laughed and got off the phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>went to his bed and thought,</v>

82
00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.130
<v Speaker 1>what a shitty day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew it was going to be Shitty,</v>

83
00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.300
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

84
00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.220
<v Speaker 1>you never know about tomorrow.</v>

85
00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.650
<v Speaker 2>Pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Susan,</v>

86
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.500
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>My son,</v>

87
00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.680
<v Speaker 2>my son,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I</v>

88
00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:10.693
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>
