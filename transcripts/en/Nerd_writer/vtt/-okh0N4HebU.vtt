1
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.590
<v Speaker 1>Coffee on a Tuesday block 13.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2
00:00:04.591 --> 00:00:04.990
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

3
00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:05.823
<v Speaker 2>spider.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're trying to scare me because it's </v>

4
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.630
<v Speaker 2>13 flood.</v>

5
00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:22.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

7
00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:25.500
<v Speaker 1>I said it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Raising awareness is for pussies.</v>

8
00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.440
<v Speaker 1>What we explained,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see very clearly on this diagram</v>

9
00:00:28.441 --> 00:00:29.274
<v Speaker 1>that I just made,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there are three different types of </v>

10
00:00:31.471 --> 00:00:32.940
<v Speaker 1>rates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can raise awareness,</v>

11
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.080
<v Speaker 1>you can raise understanding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you can raise money.</v>

12
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.933
<v Speaker 1>Of those three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly one stands out as being for </v>

13
00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:40.623
<v Speaker 1>postings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so all you fund hipsters out there who </v>

14
00:00:42.151 --> 00:00:47.010
<v Speaker 1>grew your mustache for movember to raise</v>
<v Speaker 1>some awareness for prostate cancer.</v>

15
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.220
<v Speaker 1>I say yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is better than doing nothing,</v>

16
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.570
<v Speaker 1>but you are nonetheless still pussies</v>

17
00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.923
<v Speaker 2>to prove it to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm here at the Comerica Bank Tower in </v>

18
00:00:57.701 --> 00:00:58.534
<v Speaker 2>downtown Los Angeles and I'm about to </v>
<v Speaker 2>walk up 50 flights of steps to raise </v>

19
00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.920
<v Speaker 2>awareness for cystic fibrosis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at all these pussies.</v>

20
00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:10.083
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do one better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not only am I going to climb 50 flights </v>

21
00:01:12.281 --> 00:01:16.120
<v Speaker 2>of stairs when I'm going to raise some </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding in the process,</v>

22
00:01:16.121 --> 00:01:16.954
<v Speaker 2>so every 10 flights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to explain a little bit more </v>

23
00:01:19.271 --> 00:01:20.920
<v Speaker 2>to you about what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cystic.</v>

24
00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.030
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here we go.</v>

25
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.293
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

26
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.840
<v Speaker 5>you have a team that makes it</v>

27
00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:58.813
<v Speaker 2>10 existing fibrosis is an inherited </v>
<v Speaker 2>disease that affects the lungs and the </v>

28
00:02:08.551 --> 00:02:09.384
<v Speaker 2>digestive system and affected gene and </v>
<v Speaker 2>its protein product cause the body to </v>

29
00:02:13.111 --> 00:02:13.944
<v Speaker 2>produce unusually thick and sticky </v>
<v Speaker 2>mucous that clogs the lungs that leads </v>

30
00:02:17.251 --> 00:02:18.084
<v Speaker 2>to life threatening lung infections and </v>
<v Speaker 2>obstructs the pancreas which makes </v>

31
00:02:20.371 --> 00:02:24.420
<v Speaker 2>enzymes that help the body break down </v>
<v Speaker 2>food and absorb nutrients.</v>

32
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.950
<v Speaker 2>Currently about 70,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>people in the world happened.</v>

33
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.410
<v Speaker 2>That's about 100,000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so maybe you know someone who hasn't.</v>

34
00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.000
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do these 22 years,</v>

35
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.690
<v Speaker 2>the median life expectancy of a sufferer</v>
<v Speaker 2>of cystic fibrosis days late 30,</v>

36
00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.790
<v Speaker 2>50 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was about six months necessarily 20,</v>

37
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.900
<v Speaker 2>already filled the muscle on the muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>burn up,</v>

38
00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.893
<v Speaker 2>power it suffers of cystic fibrosis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a mutation on their seventh </v>

39
00:02:51.391 --> 00:02:52.224
<v Speaker 2>chromosome on a gene called the cystic </v>
<v Speaker 2>fibrosis transmembrane conductance </v>

40
00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.993
<v Speaker 2>regulator for cf ball,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cftr closest thick respiratory </v>

41
00:03:00.551 --> 00:03:01.384
<v Speaker 2>secretions that are hard to clear from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the sewing bacteria become more easily </v>

42
00:03:04.891 --> 00:03:07.800
<v Speaker 2>tracked and causing infection and </v>
<v Speaker 2>inflammation in the.</v>

43
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.610
<v Speaker 2>Also in the pancreas organ that helps </v>
<v Speaker 2>you break down all the fat,</v>

44
00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:12.810
<v Speaker 2>protein,</v>
<v Speaker 2>carbs,</v>

45
00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:13.733
<v Speaker 2>and fat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You will find the disease blocks these </v>

46
00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.983
<v Speaker 2>enzymes that prohibits digestion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This means that necessarily fat soluble </v>

47
00:03:19.681 --> 00:03:20.514
<v Speaker 2>score,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vitamins don't get absorbed into the </v>

48
00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:24.880
<v Speaker 2>bloodstream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

49
00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.823
<v Speaker 2>10 flights.</v>

50
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:33.850
<v Speaker 2>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is easy.</v>

51
00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.450
<v Speaker 2>Thank you so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the medicine,</v>

52
00:03:40.801 --> 00:03:44.160
<v Speaker 2>we follow the same enzymes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vitamins,</v>

53
00:03:44.161 --> 00:03:48.510
<v Speaker 2>antibiotics to stop infection,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mucus thinner as an bronco.</v>

54
00:03:48.511 --> 00:03:52.200
<v Speaker 2>Dilators to facilitate read,</v>
<v Speaker 2>suffers from cystic fibrosis,</v>

55
00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.470
<v Speaker 2>digests less.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to eat more,</v>

56
00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.900
<v Speaker 2>more calories and more fat all while </v>
<v Speaker 2>maintaining a healthy weight.</v>

57
00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.200
<v Speaker 2>Because a healthy body makes for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>strong immune system.</v>

58
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:02.880
<v Speaker 2>And in this case it has to work </v>
<v Speaker 2>overtime.</v>

59
00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.360
<v Speaker 2>Exercise like this is a must,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's</v>

60
00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.353
<v Speaker 5>good.</v>

61
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.943
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so how is their life different from </v>

62
00:04:20.941 --> 00:04:21.774
<v Speaker 2>ours?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to take different medicines </v>

63
00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:23.543
<v Speaker 2>all day long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to use a nebulizer to inhale </v>

64
00:04:25.291 --> 00:04:27.600
<v Speaker 2>special ms medicines directly into their</v>
<v Speaker 2>lungs.</v>

65
00:04:27.601 --> 00:04:28.434
<v Speaker 2>They have to watch their sugar because </v>
<v Speaker 2>diabetes is especially prevalent among </v>

66
00:04:31.021 --> 00:04:33.240
<v Speaker 2>the cystic fibrosis community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're in and out of the hospital.</v>

67
00:04:33.241 --> 00:04:34.074
<v Speaker 2>They can't smoke cigarettes or marijuana</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're especially susceptible </v>

68
00:04:36.751 --> 00:04:39.540
<v Speaker 2>to fungal and bacteria.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can drink alcohol,</v>

69
00:04:39.541 --> 00:04:40.374
<v Speaker 2>but only in moderation though that might</v>
<v Speaker 2>be said for everyone should have </v>

70
00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.260
<v Speaker 2>scratched,</v>
<v Speaker 2>scratched,</v>

71
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.883
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't stress</v>

72
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:56.150
<v Speaker 5>like a before.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Thank you.</v>

73
00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:13.183
<v Speaker 2>He's let it be known that Justin Syriana</v>
<v Speaker 2>the camera and also made it up 50 </v>

74
00:05:16.971 --> 00:05:18.350
<v Speaker 2>flights with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you very much,</v>

75
00:05:18.351 --> 00:05:20.780
<v Speaker 2>Jay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not a trick.</v>

76
00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:23.713
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That'd be really ready to take it away </v>

77
00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:26.920
<v Speaker 2>at home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thanks Evan.</v>

78
00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:30.210
<v Speaker 1>So do you remember the cft?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rg?</v>

79
00:05:30.211 --> 00:05:31.044
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what's happening on a molecular </v>

80
00:05:32.841 --> 00:05:33.674
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A gene is like a little instruction </v>

81
00:05:34.881 --> 00:05:35.714
<v Speaker 1>manual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It tells amino acids how to shape </v>

82
00:05:37.401 --> 00:05:41.390
<v Speaker 1>themselves into proteins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Proteins are these wildly complex shapes</v>

83
00:05:41.391 --> 00:05:44.600
<v Speaker 1>like bunches of ribbon that perform </v>
<v Speaker 1>various functions in the bottle.</v>

84
00:05:44.601 --> 00:05:48.320
<v Speaker 1>The shape is everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a name and a job all in one.</v>

85
00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.620
<v Speaker 1>It tells everything around what it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>there to do.</v>

86
00:05:51.621 --> 00:05:52.454
<v Speaker 1>The cftr protein coming from the CFTR </v>
<v Speaker 1>gene sits on the membrane of cells and </v>

87
00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.290
<v Speaker 1>the coming and going of sodium chloride </v>
<v Speaker 1>or salt.</v>

88
00:06:00.291 --> 00:06:01.250
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

89
00:06:01.251 --> 00:06:02.084
<v Speaker 1>So far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mutation associated with cystic </v>

90
00:06:03.141 --> 00:06:03.974
<v Speaker 1>fibrosis is a faulty instruction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The protein is constructed wrong and </v>

91
00:06:07.911 --> 00:06:10.220
<v Speaker 1>instead of facilitating the passions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>salt,</v>

92
00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.073
<v Speaker 1>it blocks it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is what creates the mucus </v>

93
00:06:12.621 --> 00:06:13.454
<v Speaker 1>buildup and all the other troubles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there's a drug in development by </v>

94
00:06:16.041 --> 00:06:19.160
<v Speaker 1>vertex pharmaceuticals called VX seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven.</v>

95
00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:23.830
<v Speaker 1>It's a CFTR potentiator and it aims to </v>
<v Speaker 1>increase the function of those effective</v>

96
00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:24.673
<v Speaker 1>cftr genes by increasing the gating </v>
<v Speaker 1>activity or the ability for ions to be </v>

97
00:06:29.121 --> 00:06:29.954
<v Speaker 1>transported across the cell membrane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's currently in phase three of FDA </v>

98
00:06:33.051 --> 00:06:33.884
<v Speaker 1>trials and it has had promising results </v>
<v Speaker 1>so far along partly due to the </v>

99
00:06:36.801 --> 00:06:40.550
<v Speaker 1>fundraising done by the cystic fibrosis </v>
<v Speaker 1>foundation or the CFF.</v>

100
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:41.833
<v Speaker 1>And we can only hope for the best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why raising understanding is </v>

101
00:06:44.511 --> 00:06:45.344
<v Speaker 1>better than raising awareness because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know where your money is going if </v>

102
00:06:47.751 --> 00:06:48.584
<v Speaker 1>you donate to this cause,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're donating to the research and </v>

103
00:06:49.941 --> 00:06:50.774
<v Speaker 1>development of gene therapy treatments </v>
<v Speaker 1>that will attack this disease at its </v>

104
00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:57.530
<v Speaker 1>root and potentially cure those affected</v>
<v Speaker 1>with cystic fibrosis forever.</v>

105
00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:01.640
<v Speaker 1>We all get just one life and then we die</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the end.</v>

106
00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:06.700
<v Speaker 1>All we can hope for is to get 60 or 80 </v>
<v Speaker 1>or 100 years of it to do what we love,</v>

107
00:07:07.131 --> 00:07:09.110
<v Speaker 1>to spend it with family and friends to </v>
<v Speaker 1>create,</v>

108
00:07:09.111 --> 00:07:09.944
<v Speaker 1>to learn to do whatever we feel is </v>
<v Speaker 1>donate and give those with cystic </v>

109
00:07:13.191 --> 00:07:14.024
<v Speaker 1>fibrosis the chance of 100 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's why raising money is better than </v>

110
00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:20.540
<v Speaker 1>raising understand and it's what they </v>
<v Speaker 1>all did</v>

111
00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:26.860
<v Speaker 6>and it's what he did,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which I guess makes me the pussy.</v>

112
00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:31.773
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you could find information about where </v>

113
00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.200
<v Speaker 7>to donate the dude</v>
