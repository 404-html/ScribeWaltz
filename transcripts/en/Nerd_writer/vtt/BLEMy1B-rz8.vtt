00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.100
<v Speaker 1>Hello,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all you haymakers and hamburgers,</v>

2
00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.760
<v Speaker 1>coffee on a Tuesday and Vlog 58</v>

3
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:17.460
<v Speaker 2>with</v>

4
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.293
<v Speaker 1>few exceptions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really read much contemporary </v>

5
00:00:20.131 --> 00:00:21.740
<v Speaker 1>fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been that way for awhile.</v>

6
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:22.613
<v Speaker 1>If you take a look at my bookshelf,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you'll find is a collection of </v>

7
00:00:24.361 --> 00:00:28.290
<v Speaker 1>almost exclusively classic author like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Henry James Proust.</v>

8
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.270
<v Speaker 1>Hugo came up now because steinbeck balls</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course shakespeare.</v>

9
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.133
<v Speaker 1>Now there's an irony to this because </v>
<v Speaker 1>many of these books were assigned to me </v>

10
00:00:36.601 --> 00:00:38.370
<v Speaker 1>as part of my secondary school </v>
<v Speaker 1>curriculum,</v>

11
00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:39.204
<v Speaker 1>but in almost every case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I read look more like this than </v>

12
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.200
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many windows do I have over there?</v>

13
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.330
<v Speaker 1>In one sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad these books were assigned to us</v>

14
00:00:48.331 --> 00:00:50.550
<v Speaker 1>because now when I actually want to read</v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

15
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.650
<v Speaker 1>I know exactly where to look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>

16
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.280
<v Speaker 1>I sometimes suspect that that's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason why they assign them to us in the</v>

17
00:00:56.281 --> 00:00:57.114
<v Speaker 1>first place to map the intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 1>geography of what is important and </v>

18
00:01:00.091 --> 00:01:01.920
<v Speaker 1>lasting in literature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

19
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:03.480
<v Speaker 1>what other reason could there be?</v>

20
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.313
<v Speaker 1>I remember rereading Hawthorne's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the scarlet letter a few years back and </v>

21
00:01:06.481 --> 00:01:07.314
<v Speaker 1>thinking whoever gave this to me when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was 15 must have been insane to think I </v>

22
00:01:11.161 --> 00:01:11.994
<v Speaker 1>had the mental acuity to process one of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if not the premier novel in American </v>

23
00:01:16.351 --> 00:01:17.184
<v Speaker 1>literature at that age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I barely had the mental acuity to </v>

24
00:01:18.871 --> 00:01:21.660
<v Speaker 1>process the matrix realities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mo doubt,</v>

25
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.110
<v Speaker 1>reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dreams will destiny.</v>

26
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.060
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I use the word classic in a pretty broad</v>

27
00:01:30.061 --> 00:01:30.894
<v Speaker 1>sense for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can be anything from homer and </v>

28
00:01:32.221 --> 00:01:36.390
<v Speaker 1>Shakespeare to whack and Philip K,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dick Essentially I'm using as my measure</v>

29
00:01:36.391 --> 00:01:39.570
<v Speaker 1>a kind of collective academic agreement </v>
<v Speaker 1>about what is great,</v>

30
00:01:39.571 --> 00:01:42.300
<v Speaker 1>what is influential or pressure or </v>
<v Speaker 1>complex.</v>

31
00:01:42.301 --> 00:01:44.810
<v Speaker 1>Really whatever penguin has made a </v>
<v Speaker 1>version,</v>

32
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.280
<v Speaker 1>but perhaps I'm wrong to let penguin be </v>
<v Speaker 1>the arbiter of what is and isn't a class</v>

33
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.183
<v Speaker 1>taking a more precise definition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've turned to the great ts Elliot who </v>

34
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.513
<v Speaker 1>in his essay what is a classic contends </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there are actually no classics in </v>

35
00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.840
<v Speaker 1>all of English literature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even such greats as Milton Shakespeare,</v>

36
00:02:00.841 --> 00:02:01.674
<v Speaker 1>to whom there are perhaps no superiors </v>
<v Speaker 1>in style and maturity fail to achieve </v>

37
00:02:05.911 --> 00:02:08.400
<v Speaker 1>classical status because of the language</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

38
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.790
<v Speaker 1>Had not yet reached mature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A common style writes Eliot is one which</v>

39
00:02:11.791 --> 00:02:12.624
<v Speaker 1>makes us exclaimed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not this is a man of genius using the </v>

40
00:02:14.671 --> 00:02:15.504
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this realizes the genius of the </v>

41
00:02:18.301 --> 00:02:19.134
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do not say this when reading </v>

42
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.730
<v Speaker 1>Shakespeare or Milton because we are </v>
<v Speaker 1>always conscious of the greatness of the</v>

43
00:02:23.731 --> 00:02:27.150
<v Speaker 1>man and the miracles that he is </v>
<v Speaker 1>performing with the length.</v>

44
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:28.043
<v Speaker 1>Indeed Elliot holds that a universal </v>
<v Speaker 1>classic comes at the confluence of a </v>

45
00:02:30.831 --> 00:02:31.664
<v Speaker 1>maturity of mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>manners and common style that Elizabeth </v>

46
00:02:35.401 --> 00:02:37.110
<v Speaker 1>and poetry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I've said before,</v>

47
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.123
<v Speaker 1>is more invented by Shakespeare then </v>
<v Speaker 1>fully realized by him that the manners </v>

48
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:42.623
<v Speaker 1>of the period were more provincial than </v>
<v Speaker 1>universal elliot points to Virgil's </v>

49
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.940
<v Speaker 1>Aeneid as the quintessential classic and</v>
<v Speaker 1>to Latin as the quintessential classical</v>

50
00:02:50.941 --> 00:02:51.774
<v Speaker 1>language for consolidates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The greatness of a mature predecessor </v>

51
00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.620
<v Speaker 1>and is the common ancestor to which all </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the European languages are air.</v>

52
00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:59.483
<v Speaker 1>It is by the standard of Virgil and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Latin that old modern works are judged </v>

53
00:03:03.191 --> 00:03:04.024
<v Speaker 1>and it is a necessary standard for </v>
<v Speaker 1>English literature to Excel and not be </v>

54
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:12.010
<v Speaker 1>consumed by chaos while being perhaps </v>
<v Speaker 1>impossible for it to achieve.</v>

55
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.190
<v Speaker 1>Though we must soldier on imagining that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't,</v>

56
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.920
<v Speaker 1>it's the idea of a common style that </v>
<v Speaker 1>interests me.</v>

57
00:03:17.921 --> 00:03:18.754
<v Speaker 1>Most.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Common style is something that marks a </v>

58
00:03:20.651 --> 00:03:23.860
<v Speaker 1>classical period,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether in Elliot's larger sense or in a</v>

59
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.510
<v Speaker 1>lowercase sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

60
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.630
<v Speaker 1>of classics within English,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poetry and prose.</v>

61
00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:29.523
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean as Elliot says that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>best writers of such a period are </v>

62
00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.393
<v Speaker 1>indistinguishable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but rather that there are differences </v>

63
00:03:34.751 --> 00:03:35.584
<v Speaker 1>are more subtle and refined like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>shades of tastes between superlative </v>

64
00:03:39.401 --> 00:03:40.234
<v Speaker 1>wine and it is also a mark of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>classical period that the era before it </v>

65
00:03:43.091 --> 00:03:43.924
<v Speaker 1>is branded with eccentricities as </v>
<v Speaker 1>writers stab in the dark towards </v>

66
00:03:47.111 --> 00:03:47.944
<v Speaker 1>something not yet universal and </v>
<v Speaker 1>eccentricity to as the classical period </v>

67
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.050
<v Speaker 1>passes away and originality becomes more</v>
<v Speaker 1>valued than correctness.</v>

68
00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what period we find </v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves in today,</v>

69
00:03:59.141 --> 00:04:04.141
<v Speaker 1>but eccentricities a kind of agitated </v>
<v Speaker 1>free for all seems to describe it.</v>

70
00:04:04.241 --> 00:04:07.090
<v Speaker 1>This of course reflects the culture at </v>
<v Speaker 1>large.</v>

71
00:04:07.091 --> 00:04:07.924
<v Speaker 1>Not that we are devoid of great authors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but rather have great movements of a </v>

72
00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.460
<v Speaker 1>common style and every time I sit down </v>
<v Speaker 1>to write,</v>

73
00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.450
<v Speaker 1>I find it impossible not to aim at </v>
<v Speaker 1>classic.</v>

74
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.313
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe this suggests a Hubris in me or </v>

75
00:04:23.291 --> 00:04:24.124
<v Speaker 1>maybe the fact that I'm self conscious </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it suggests a deficiency in the </v>

76
00:04:27.731 --> 00:04:28.564
<v Speaker 1>period as a writer and reader in 2013,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I engage in no revolt against the </v>

77
00:04:32.501 --> 00:04:36.310
<v Speaker 1>current state of English literature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's too heterogeneous now.</v>

78
00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:37.353
<v Speaker 1>Even for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I only wished to navigate that old and </v>

79
00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.553
<v Speaker 1>shamefully pass a river,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which from the mountain of homework </v>

80
00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.710
<v Speaker 1>passes through all my heroes and me too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know not what?</v>

81
00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:00.001
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
