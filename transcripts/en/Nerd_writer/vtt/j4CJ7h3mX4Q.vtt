1
00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.450
<v Speaker 1>Great Wings beating still above the </v>
<v Speaker 1>staggering girl,</v>

2
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.150
<v Speaker 1>her thighs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>caressed by the dark webs her nape,</v>

3
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.323
<v Speaker 1>caught in his bill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He holds her helpless breast upon his </v>

4
00:00:32.191 --> 00:00:33.024
<v Speaker 1>breast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can those terrified vague fingers </v>

5
00:00:36.631 --> 00:00:37.464
<v Speaker 1>push the feathered glory from her </v>
<v Speaker 1>loosening thighs and how can body lead </v>

6
00:00:42.631 --> 00:00:47.631
<v Speaker 1>in that white rush but feel the strange </v>
<v Speaker 1>heart beating where it lies,</v>

7
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.860
<v Speaker 1>a shutter in the loins in genders there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the broken wall,</v>

8
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.040
<v Speaker 1>the burning roof and tower and agamemnon</v>
<v Speaker 1>dead being so caught up,</v>

9
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.080
<v Speaker 1>so mastered by the brute blood of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>air.</v>

10
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:05.213
<v Speaker 1>Did she put on his knowledge with his </v>
<v Speaker 1>power before the indifferent beak could </v>

11
00:01:10.351 --> 00:01:11.184
<v Speaker 1>let her drop later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the Swan is a sonnet that William </v>

12
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.330
<v Speaker 1>Butler yeats wrote and rewrote many </v>
<v Speaker 1>times,</v>

13
00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:20.373
<v Speaker 1>but finally appeared in this form in his</v>
<v Speaker 1>renowned collection called the tower </v>

14
00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.220
<v Speaker 1>published in 1928 when he was 63.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Tower was the first book of poems he</v>

15
00:01:30.311 --> 00:01:34.330
<v Speaker 1>released after becoming a Nobel laureate</v>
<v Speaker 1>five years prior.</v>

16
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.610
<v Speaker 1>Gates is of that exceptionally rare </v>
<v Speaker 1>breed of artists who improved in quality</v>

17
00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:41.793
<v Speaker 1>as he entered his late life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The poem takes it subject from Greek </v>

18
00:01:45.041 --> 00:01:46.690
<v Speaker 1>mythology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The story of Zeus,</v>

19
00:01:46.691 --> 00:01:47.524
<v Speaker 1>assuming the form of a swan to seduce </v>
<v Speaker 1>later wife of the Spartan King </v>

20
00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.460
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] who bore from this union,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Helen of troy,</v>

21
00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.700
<v Speaker 1>whose infidelity ignited the Trojan war </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the beginning of classical history.</v>

22
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.910
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before we explore the way yates used the</v>

23
00:02:02.911 --> 00:02:03.744
<v Speaker 1>subject to create meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just take a quick look at the actual </v>

24
00:02:06.941 --> 00:02:10.560
<v Speaker 1>shape of the poem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something unsettling about it.</v>

25
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.320
<v Speaker 1>The form of the sonnet appears to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>hijacked everywhere.</v>

26
00:02:14.321 --> 00:02:15.154
<v Speaker 1>It's twisted and torn apart like Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Frankenstein Yates has surgically </v>

27
00:02:19.721 --> 00:02:23.260
<v Speaker 1>attached the Shakespearean Sonnet with </v>
<v Speaker 1>its first two quatrains,</v>

28
00:02:23.261 --> 00:02:24.530
<v Speaker 1>featuring an a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

29
00:02:24.531 --> 00:02:25.364
<v Speaker 1>b,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a b rhyme scheme with the Petrarchan </v>

30
00:02:27.641 --> 00:02:31.810
<v Speaker 1>sonnet in the last six lines and an efg </v>
<v Speaker 1>efg rhyme scheme,</v>

31
00:02:31.811 --> 00:02:36.070
<v Speaker 1>including the unnerving slant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ryan up and drop,</v>

32
00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.420
<v Speaker 1>which robs the final moment of any </v>
<v Speaker 1>auditory closure,</v>

33
00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:41.283
<v Speaker 1>most notable of although his line 11,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which appears to be slashed and split </v>

34
00:02:45.731 --> 00:02:50.731
<v Speaker 1>into leaving the final three lines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just dangling there like late to herself</v>

35
00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.280
<v Speaker 1>in the indifferent beak of the Swan.</v>

36
00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:55.293
<v Speaker 1>In this way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yates commits a kind of violence on the </v>

37
00:02:58.331 --> 00:03:00.070
<v Speaker 1>sonnet form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not for nothing.</v>

38
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.990
<v Speaker 1>The poet is attempting to augment the </v>
<v Speaker 1>violent content of his work,</v>

39
00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:06.043
<v Speaker 1>his sonnets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least she experienced on it's are </v>

40
00:03:07.961 --> 00:03:08.794
<v Speaker 1>traditionally about great love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet here yates uses the form to </v>

41
00:03:12.431 --> 00:03:15.790
<v Speaker 1>describe what could be considered the </v>
<v Speaker 1>exact opposite,</v>

42
00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:16.813
<v Speaker 1>an act of violent rape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you look at successive versions </v>

43
00:03:20.321 --> 00:03:21.154
<v Speaker 1>of later and the Swan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see that yates turned up the </v>

44
00:03:23.471 --> 00:03:25.720
<v Speaker 1>volume on this violence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

45
00:03:25.721 --> 00:03:27.490
<v Speaker 1>in one version,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the poem begins,</v>

46
00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.430
<v Speaker 1>a rush a sudden we'll and hovering </v>
<v Speaker 1>still,</v>

47
00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:31.473
<v Speaker 1>the bird descends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her frail thighs pressed by the webbed </v>

48
00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.193
<v Speaker 1>toes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that all powerful bill has laid her </v>

49
00:03:37.811 --> 00:03:40.720
<v Speaker 1>helpless face upon his breast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

50
00:03:40.721 --> 00:03:45.721
<v Speaker 1>the early version almost assumes late as</v>
<v Speaker 1>acquiescence to the gods advances in the</v>

51
00:03:46.781 --> 00:03:50.200
<v Speaker 1>later version beginning with the shock </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a sudden blow.</v>

52
00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.270
<v Speaker 1>Zeus is molestation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is intensely emphasize and emphasize too</v>

53
00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:56.223
<v Speaker 1>is later and the readers disorientation </v>
<v Speaker 1>the great wings beating still the </v>

54
00:04:01.451 --> 00:04:02.284
<v Speaker 1>ambiguity of beating still.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can wings be still if they're </v>

55
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.320
<v Speaker 1>beating?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And on the other hand,</v>

56
00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.810
<v Speaker 1>if he means that they're still beating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that means terrifyingly,</v>

57
00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.230
<v Speaker 1>that the rape has already begun while </v>
<v Speaker 1>the swan is still in the air.</v>

58
00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.380
<v Speaker 1>Now in this version,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the girl is staggering,</v>

59
00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:25.000
<v Speaker 1>her thighs caressed a word that disturbs</v>
<v Speaker 1>us by comingling,</v>

60
00:04:25.001 --> 00:04:27.910
<v Speaker 1>the erotic with the vicious something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that Yates does,</v>

61
00:04:27.911 --> 00:04:32.860
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of this poem caressed by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dark webs that gives a sense of just how</v>

62
00:04:32.861 --> 00:04:35.560
<v Speaker 1>big the bird is because not even the </v>
<v Speaker 1>toes,</v>

63
00:04:35.561 --> 00:04:36.394
<v Speaker 1>but the webs between the toes are what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>caressing her and it should be noted </v>

64
00:04:40.091 --> 00:04:40.924
<v Speaker 1>that both the first and second line and </v>
<v Speaker 1>with anjem myths pulling us awkwardly </v>

65
00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.420
<v Speaker 1>through the verse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's not until the last line of that</v>

66
00:04:49.421 --> 00:04:51.790
<v Speaker 1>first that we finally get the subject.</v>

67
00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:52.653
<v Speaker 1>He as if everything was happening so </v>
<v Speaker 1>fast that later couldn't find her </v>

68
00:04:56.681 --> 00:05:00.070
<v Speaker 1>bearings until the gruesome act was </v>
<v Speaker 1>already underway.</v>

69
00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.240
<v Speaker 1>The first quatrain of later and the swan</v>
<v Speaker 1>is disturbing in the extreme,</v>

70
00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.600
<v Speaker 1>setting the scene from latest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>horrified point of view.</v>

71
00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:08.673
<v Speaker 1>Then we have the second quadrant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is made up of two rhetorical </v>

72
00:05:11.921 --> 00:05:15.040
<v Speaker 1>questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both seem to ask the same thing.</v>

73
00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.580
<v Speaker 1>What could lay to do against the awesome</v>
<v Speaker 1>power of a God?</v>

74
00:05:18.581 --> 00:05:19.414
<v Speaker 1>How could she possibly resist?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can she do anything but feel the </v>

75
00:05:22.871 --> 00:05:27.730
<v Speaker 1>strange heart beating where it lies?</v>
<v Speaker 1>These questions can be read in two ways.</v>

76
00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.090
<v Speaker 1>You can read them rhetorically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to say read them as saying,</v>

77
00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:35.410
<v Speaker 1>obviously she can't do anything and such</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the tragedy of the poem,</v>

78
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.940
<v Speaker 1>but I think Yates invites us to read </v>
<v Speaker 1>them literally as well,</v>

79
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.833
<v Speaker 1>which is to say what can she do more on </v>
<v Speaker 1>that in a moment after the first two </v>

80
00:05:46.421 --> 00:05:47.254
<v Speaker 1>verses comes the Volta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a term for when a sonnet turns and the </v>

81
00:05:51.341 --> 00:05:56.020
<v Speaker 1>questions or events posed in the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>lines are answered in this case,</v>

82
00:05:56.021 --> 00:05:56.854
<v Speaker 1>after the shutter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>referring both to the moment of </v>

83
00:05:58.881 --> 00:06:01.070
<v Speaker 1>ejaculation and latest fear.</v>

84
00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:02.143
<v Speaker 1>We have the poet examining the </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences of the rate and they are </v>

85
00:06:05.421 --> 00:06:09.350
<v Speaker 1>really far reaching the broken wall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the burning roof and tower,</v>

86
00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:14.650
<v Speaker 1>all intimate that the rape of late at </v>
<v Speaker 1>not only caused but insured the eventual</v>

87
00:06:15.261 --> 00:06:19.520
<v Speaker 1>destruction of troy and the rise of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Greece and western history,</v>

88
00:06:19.521 --> 00:06:23.540
<v Speaker 1>a history that was born out of rape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>war and murder,</v>

89
00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:28.520
<v Speaker 1>and agamemnon dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here we have gates own alteration to the</v>

90
00:06:28.521 --> 00:06:31.540
<v Speaker 1>mythological history as the story goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>later,</v>

91
00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:32.473
<v Speaker 1>laid two eggs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one bore helen and pollux Demi Gods and </v>

92
00:06:36.441 --> 00:06:40.550
<v Speaker 1>children of Zeus and the other bore </v>
<v Speaker 1>caster and Clayton Nestra,</v>

93
00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.850
<v Speaker 1>children of latest mortal husband Tim </v>
<v Speaker 1>Darrius,</v>

94
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.630
<v Speaker 1>who she laid with the same night by </v>
<v Speaker 1>citing the death of Agamemnon,</v>

95
00:06:47.631 --> 00:06:50.560
<v Speaker 1>famously killed by his wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clytemnestra,</v>

96
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.510
<v Speaker 1>as among the faded ramifications of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rape.</v>

97
00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:54.673
<v Speaker 1>Yates demonstrates the full effect of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the trauma and by doing this he reaches </v>

98
00:06:58.731 --> 00:06:59.564
<v Speaker 1>into the history of art as well because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the calls to troy and agamemnon staff </v>

99
00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:06.650
<v Speaker 1>bring to mind respectively.</v>

100
00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:07.573
<v Speaker 1>Homer's Iliad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pinnacle of the epic form and </v>

101
00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:12.230
<v Speaker 1>escalates his play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Oresteia,</v>

102
00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:13.213
<v Speaker 1>the first great work of Western drama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All this is done in 11 words without </v>

103
00:07:19.281 --> 00:07:22.220
<v Speaker 1>even mentioning the continued sexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>overtones.</v>

104
00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:27.020
<v Speaker 1>And then Yates concludes the poem with </v>
<v Speaker 1>one final question.</v>

105
00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:28.453
<v Speaker 1>Did she put on his knowledge with his </v>
<v Speaker 1>power before at the indifferent beak </v>

106
00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:33.163
<v Speaker 1>could let her drop and to understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>this and the poem itself and its larger </v>

107
00:07:36.741 --> 00:07:37.574
<v Speaker 1>context,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to know a little bit more about </v>

108
00:07:39.441 --> 00:07:42.380
<v Speaker 1>yates and his way of thinking from his </v>
<v Speaker 1>early life.</v>

109
00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:45.620
<v Speaker 1>Yates had always been drawn to </v>
<v Speaker 1>mysticism,</v>

110
00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:49.640
<v Speaker 1>to astrology and to the occult in Middle</v>
<v Speaker 1>Age,</v>

111
00:07:49.641 --> 00:07:54.170
<v Speaker 1>he developed his own complex </v>
<v Speaker 1>metaphysical and cosmic system,</v>

112
00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:58.690
<v Speaker 1>which he laid out in extreme detail in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>book called a vision.</v>

113
00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:00.073
<v Speaker 1>One of the key ideas was that history </v>
<v Speaker 1>was made up into gyres or cycles of </v>

114
00:08:05.031 --> 00:08:09.410
<v Speaker 1>about 2000 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alternating between ages of spirituality</v>

115
00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:11.300
<v Speaker 1>and ages of secularism.</v>

116
00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:12.433
<v Speaker 1>Each cycle reached the peak of its </v>
<v Speaker 1>excellence in the exact middle than </v>

117
00:08:15.921 --> 00:08:16.754
<v Speaker 1>decades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slowly until it was finally replaced by </v>

118
00:08:19.341 --> 00:08:20.174
<v Speaker 1>the new one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This idea was explored most potently in </v>

119
00:08:22.101 --> 00:08:24.140
<v Speaker 1>his famous poem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second coming,</v>

120
00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:25.423
<v Speaker 1>Yates identified his own time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our time as the end of the religious </v>

121
00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:30.853
<v Speaker 1>cycle of Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and envision the start of a new unknown </v>

122
00:08:33.471 --> 00:08:37.580
<v Speaker 1>cycle of secularism initiated by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming of a great beast.</v>

123
00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:42.230
<v Speaker 1>The last time such a cycle began is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>subject of later and the Swan,</v>

124
00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:43.363
<v Speaker 1>the rape of later by Zeus signals the </v>
<v Speaker 1>start of the classical era around 2000 </v>

125
00:08:48.261 --> 00:08:50.270
<v Speaker 1>BC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In each case,</v>

126
00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:51.163
<v Speaker 1>the divine visits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the earth and leaves the seeds of the </v>

127
00:08:54.141 --> 00:08:58.230
<v Speaker 1>history that is to come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the key to this question.</v>

128
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:01.430
<v Speaker 1>Did she put on his knowledge with his </v>
<v Speaker 1>power,</v>

129
00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:06.180
<v Speaker 1>did later glimpse the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was creating the cycle.</v>

130
00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:09.000
<v Speaker 1>She was inaugurating before the </v>
<v Speaker 1>indifferent.</v>

131
00:09:09.001 --> 00:09:11.460
<v Speaker 1>God flew away in some way.</v>

132
00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:16.460
<v Speaker 1>He suggests the shape of things to come </v>
<v Speaker 1>is contained in its origin,</v>

133
00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:20.490
<v Speaker 1>but can humans discern it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the question.</v>

134
00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:21.383
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all this stuff about gyres and cycles </v>

135
00:09:23.761 --> 00:09:26.340
<v Speaker 1>and mystical systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty out there.</v>

136
00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:30.750
<v Speaker 1>Clearly it isn't in any way scientific </v>
<v Speaker 1>or even very specific.</v>

137
00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:31.613
<v Speaker 1>There's a real debate about whether </v>
<v Speaker 1>Yates believed any of it probably in </v>

138
00:09:34.951 --> 00:09:35.784
<v Speaker 1>some way he did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what was clearly more important to </v>

139
00:09:38.551 --> 00:09:43.551
<v Speaker 1>him was having a unified system in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first place because it was from the many</v>

140
00:09:44.071 --> 00:09:49.071
<v Speaker 1>symbols of this unity that Yates was </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to extract his strongest poetry.</v>

141
00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:54.800
<v Speaker 1>Having that Matrix of sliding meanings </v>
<v Speaker 1>to work with so tightly,</v>

142
00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:58.290
<v Speaker 1>intricately woven meant that pulling one</v>
<v Speaker 1>string,</v>

143
00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.153
<v Speaker 1>evoking one symbol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>laying one idea into the form and meter </v>

144
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:08.670
<v Speaker 1>of a sonnet would make the rest of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>web light up like a Christmas tree,</v>

145
00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:09.683
<v Speaker 1>signifying a complexity that invites the</v>
<v Speaker 1>reader into a number of simultaneous </v>

146
00:10:13.921 --> 00:10:14.910
<v Speaker 1>interpretations.</v>

147
00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:19.230
<v Speaker 1>By situating the poem at a fulcrum in </v>
<v Speaker 1>history equal to our own,</v>

148
00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:20.213
<v Speaker 1>we're forced to look both at what we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming out of and what we're heading </v>

149
00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:25.890
<v Speaker 1>toward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A relevant question for any age,</v>

150
00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:26.873
<v Speaker 1>particularly relevant for Yates's own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the trauma of World War One must </v>

151
00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:35.640
<v Speaker 1>have come like a sudden blow by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>posing questions if possible,</v>

152
00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:40.040
<v Speaker 1>resistance to this brutal act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but showing no resistance on the part of</v>

153
00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:40.913
<v Speaker 1>later even possible enjoyment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The readers themselves are called on to </v>

154
00:10:45.991 --> 00:10:50.991
<v Speaker 1>imagine how we resist oppression and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature of resistance itself,</v>

155
00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:53.423
<v Speaker 1>both from a feminist point of view and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>political one by depicting an encounter </v>

156
00:10:57.631 --> 00:10:58.464
<v Speaker 1>with the divine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so savagely we're asked to examine the </v>

157
00:11:01.861 --> 00:11:06.750
<v Speaker 1>price of inspiration and by posing </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions without giving answers.</v>

158
00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:11.820
<v Speaker 1>The knowledge and the power of poetry </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself is called into question.</v>

159
00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:17.150
<v Speaker 1>All these things are compressed into </v>
<v Speaker 1>Yates's later and the swan spring loaded</v>

160
00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:22.680
<v Speaker 1>triggered by an image or a tense or upon</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a slant.</v>

161
00:11:22.681 --> 00:11:23.514
<v Speaker 1>Ryan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's so much can be packed into 14 </v>

162
00:11:25.201 --> 00:11:26.034
<v Speaker 1>lines and 113 words is a testament both </v>
<v Speaker 1>to yates and the continuing importance </v>

163
00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:32.633
<v Speaker 1>of poetry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All that's left is to pull one string </v>

164
00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:40.560
<v Speaker 1>and see what sublime network of meanings</v>
<v Speaker 1>lights up.</v>

165
00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:47.110
<v Speaker 1>Hey everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you so much for watching.</v>

<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

169

<v Speaker 1>content that I can make with this time </v>
<v Speaker 1>and this effort and it's all possible </v>
