<v Speaker 1>I do sometimes when I'm feeling not good</v>

31
00:01:36.781 --> 00:01:39.100
<v Speaker 1>as particularly shitty about myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's interesting because it's,</v>

32
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:44.120
<v Speaker 1>it's the most successful rags slash </v>
<v Speaker 1>highly opinionated.</v>

33
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.430
<v Speaker 1>It is arrived.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's total rag,</v>

34
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.720
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting things to say.</v>

35
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.210
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes there's this spoiler or </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll,</v>

36
00:01:53.211 --> 00:01:57.120
<v Speaker 1>they'll promote interesting conversation</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes like half of it is,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who just had tweeted like newt,</v>

<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

42
00:02:14.161 --> 00:02:14.994
<v Speaker 1>this is why I hate getting coffee into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the saucer because every time you lift </v>

43
00:02:18.421 --> 00:02:20.700
<v Speaker 1>it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it drips onto the paper.</v>

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.730
<v Speaker 1>Do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see that,</v>

45
00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:26.580
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

47
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.650
<v Speaker 1>drip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drip.</v>

48
00:02:31.651 --> 00:02:33.630
<v Speaker 1>But now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now I know that ended that saucer,</v>

49
00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.700
<v Speaker 1>this with coffee everywhere.</v>
