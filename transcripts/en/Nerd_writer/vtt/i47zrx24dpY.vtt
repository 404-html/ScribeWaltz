1
00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:06.423
<v Speaker 1>Come on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you mentioned to me this is the sacred </v>

2
00:00:36.401 --> 00:00:41.401
<v Speaker 1>lake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is my spot for me to read.</v>

3
00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.410
<v Speaker 1>Can't tell you the number of books have </v>
<v Speaker 1>right here.</v>

4
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.500
<v Speaker 1>Hm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

5
00:00:51.501 --> 00:00:55.390
<v Speaker 1>It's freezing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

6
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.233
<v Speaker 1>With a couple of children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it would pull it out and </v>

7
00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.490
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know myself and we've been good.</v>

8
00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.860
<v Speaker 1>We haven't done anything to be ashamed </v>
<v Speaker 1>of and it's a good thing.</v>

9
00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.000
<v Speaker 1>I want to be good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

10
00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.890
<v Speaker 2>It would be pretty cool to design a film</v>
<v Speaker 2>studies course around,</v>

11
00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:51.813
<v Speaker 2>call me by your name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The movie opens up its own interesting </v>

12
00:01:54.131 --> 00:01:58.870
<v Speaker 2>lane in film history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>populated by auteurs trying to disappear</v>

13
00:01:58.871 --> 00:02:02.050
<v Speaker 2>from their work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a paradox worth exploring.</v>

14
00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.910
<v Speaker 2>The movies that this class would </v>
<v Speaker 2>feature.</v>

15
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.190
<v Speaker 2>A handful of which you just saw in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>opening sequence,</v>

16
00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:07.293
<v Speaker 2>have similarities that are focused by </v>
<v Speaker 2>call me by your name and by director </v>

17
00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:11.703
<v Speaker 2>Luca Quad Nino's vision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that quite an Nino quotes or </v>

18
00:02:15.101 --> 00:02:19.030
<v Speaker 2>pays homage to his influences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He does something that's much harder.</v>

19
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.033
<v Speaker 2>He actually learns the lessons that </v>
<v Speaker 2>these influences teach and applies them </v>

20
00:02:23.531 --> 00:02:25.840
<v Speaker 2>in a way that adds to his personal </v>
<v Speaker 2>style.</v>

21
00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.540
<v Speaker 2>The most obvious influence I think are </v>
<v Speaker 2>the films of James Ivory specifically to</v>

22
00:02:34.541 --> 00:02:37.360
<v Speaker 2>have his elm forester adaptations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a room with a view,</v>

23
00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.700
<v Speaker 2>and Morris I say obvious because ivory </v>
<v Speaker 2>was in his late eighties.</v>

24
00:02:42.701 --> 00:02:44.880
<v Speaker 2>No less the screenwriter for call me by </v>
<v Speaker 2>your name.</v>

25
00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.690
<v Speaker 2>The market has a long career at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>merchant ivory production company is all</v>

26
00:02:49.691 --> 00:02:52.530
<v Speaker 2>over this movie now you might not know </v>
<v Speaker 2>merchant tie for you.</v>

27
00:02:52.531 --> 00:02:53.380
<v Speaker 2>The director,</v>
<v Speaker 2>producer,</v>

28
00:02:53.381 --> 00:02:56.500
<v Speaker 2>team of ivory and his life partner is </v>
<v Speaker 2>mile merchant,</v>

29
00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.600
<v Speaker 2>but along with their screenwriter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ruth,</v>

30
00:02:58.601 --> 00:03:01.630
<v Speaker 2>Joe Vala,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they created 44 films together,</v>

31
00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:02.870
<v Speaker 2>fun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>highbrow,</v>

32
00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.823
<v Speaker 2>literary adaptations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>period pieces with lavish costumes and </v>

33
00:03:06.951 --> 00:03:07.784
<v Speaker 2>sets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this may sound like stuffy pump is </v>

34
00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.100
<v Speaker 2>filmmaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the merchant ivory films or anything</v>

35
00:03:13.101 --> 00:03:18.101
<v Speaker 2>but they leave with life room with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>view.</v>

36
00:03:22.841 --> 00:03:23.674
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nature is a symbol of freedom against </v>

37
00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:29.590
<v Speaker 2>the social restrictions of the Gordian </v>
<v Speaker 2>England ivory,</v>

38
00:03:29.591 --> 00:03:30.424
<v Speaker 2>like Wat a Nino captures the warm </v>
<v Speaker 2>tactile qualities of being outdoors and </v>

39
00:03:34.901 --> 00:03:35.734
<v Speaker 2>uses the sense memory that these images </v>
<v Speaker 2>and sounds evoke as a way to trigger </v>

40
00:03:39.521 --> 00:03:41.200
<v Speaker 2>empathy for the characters</v>

41
00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:42.493
<v Speaker 3>in both films.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The desire for summer afternoons is </v>

42
00:03:45.051 --> 00:03:48.230
<v Speaker 3>paralleled with the desire for love or </v>
<v Speaker 3>sex</v>

43
00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.020
<v Speaker 2>in Morris and adaptation of foresters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>novel of homosexual love.</v>

44
00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:54.123
<v Speaker 2>The similarities are more apparent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the important ways that both Morris and </v>

45
00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.790
<v Speaker 2>Leo tentatively realized and act upon </v>
<v Speaker 2>their feelings are physical,</v>

46
00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:04.173
<v Speaker 2>not verbal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is what a good filmmaker and </v>

47
00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.870
<v Speaker 2>good actors bring to an adaptation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The translation dialogue into gesture.</v>

48
00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:12.203
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A second key influence are the films of </v>

49
00:04:17.511 --> 00:04:18.344
<v Speaker 2>Eric Rohmer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the last of the French new wave </v>

50
00:04:20.121 --> 00:04:24.980
<v Speaker 2>directors who style was less </v>
<v Speaker 2>iconoclastic than Godard or truffaut,</v>

51
00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.113
<v Speaker 2>yet whose career sustained in quality </v>
<v Speaker 2>much longer than many of his </v>

52
00:04:29.151 --> 00:04:29.984
<v Speaker 2>contemporaries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Romero is known as a very wordy </v>

53
00:04:32.061 --> 00:04:32.894
<v Speaker 2>filmmaker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His movies feature characters having </v>

54
00:04:34.581 --> 00:04:38.240
<v Speaker 2>extended philosophical conversations on </v>
<v Speaker 2>love and desire.</v>

55
00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.390
<v Speaker 2>Yet what Gwadar Nino draws from him is </v>
<v Speaker 2>his simplicity,</v>

56
00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:42.463
<v Speaker 2>his unsentimental presentation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>characters in space and his camera work </v>

57
00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.100
<v Speaker 2>like the genre Anwar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who came before him.</v>

58
00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.053
<v Speaker 2>Romana is interested in realism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not at the expense of beauty like </v>

59
00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.090
<v Speaker 2>roamers and renoirs squat.</v>

60
00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.923
<v Speaker 2>A Nino's camera in call me by your name </v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't showy and his editing isn't </v>

61
00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:01.393
<v Speaker 2>manipulative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Quad Nino and a cinematographer only </v>

62
00:05:03.531 --> 00:05:04.364
<v Speaker 2>used one lens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a 35 millimeter to mimic roughly the </v>

63
00:05:07.461 --> 00:05:11.120
<v Speaker 2>feel of human eyesight and the camera </v>
<v Speaker 2>follows the action,</v>

64
00:05:11.121 --> 00:05:14.360
<v Speaker 2>but in the way and observer might in all</v>
<v Speaker 2>of these filmmakers,</v>

65
00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.690
<v Speaker 2>long takes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't feel stylized or distracting.</v>

66
00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:18.763
<v Speaker 2>They function as a window into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment and it's important that we </v>

67
00:05:21.711 --> 00:05:24.590
<v Speaker 2>see that environment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This space is these characters inhabit,</v>

68
00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:29.240
<v Speaker 2>so depth of field is usually deep and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the use of closeups is rare.</v>

69
00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:30.133
<v Speaker 2>As Ramiro once said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason I don't like a close up is </v>

70
00:05:32.121 --> 00:05:34.730
<v Speaker 2>because it excludes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't add,</v>

71
00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:35.593
<v Speaker 2>it takes away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It suppresses the relationship of the </v>

72
00:05:37.581 --> 00:05:40.530
<v Speaker 2>character to the set,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what's important for Guantanamo,</v>

73
00:05:40.531 --> 00:05:45.531
<v Speaker 2>Nino is that he gives the actors enough </v>
<v Speaker 2>room and time for the space between them</v>

74
00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.450
<v Speaker 2>to become charged with emotion.</v>

75
00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.873
<v Speaker 2>Finally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe the most important influence on </v>

76
00:05:51.201 --> 00:05:54.290
<v Speaker 2>the structure of call me by your name is</v>
<v Speaker 2>the French director.</v>

77
00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:55.153
<v Speaker 2>Maurice Plr,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially his film I s'mores law is </v>

78
00:05:58.761 --> 00:05:59.594
<v Speaker 2>another figure on the outer rim of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>French new wave who barely has any </v>

79
00:06:03.051 --> 00:06:07.220
<v Speaker 2>recognition in America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His films are rough and unsentimental to</v>

80
00:06:07.221 --> 00:06:09.920
<v Speaker 2>the extreme,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even sloppy at times,</v>

81
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.113
<v Speaker 2>but the brim with a wild energy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're driven by people who are slaves </v>

82
00:06:14.991 --> 00:06:15.824
<v Speaker 2>to impulse and what Quad Nino admires </v>
<v Speaker 2>about plr is how these impulses drive </v>

83
00:06:20.211 --> 00:06:24.770
<v Speaker 2>the construction of the narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost dizzying how a no s'mores,</v>

84
00:06:24.771 --> 00:06:25.604
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a coming of age film about a sexually </v>

85
00:06:26.961 --> 00:06:27.794
<v Speaker 2>charged adolescent trips from scene to </v>
<v Speaker 2>scene without consideration for a </v>

86
00:06:31.341 --> 00:06:32.174
<v Speaker 2>traditional story arc that cut between </v>
<v Speaker 2>two shots could represent a jump of two </v>

87
00:06:35.601 --> 00:06:40.601
<v Speaker 2>seconds or two months and the audience </v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't prepare for either when to call me</v>

88
00:06:41.091 --> 00:06:41.924
<v Speaker 2>by your name isn't as extreme as this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but gotten dino's narrative follows a </v>

89
00:06:44.781 --> 00:06:45.614
<v Speaker 2>similar rhythm where the through line </v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't the developments of a three act </v>

90
00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:49.573
<v Speaker 2>plot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but rather the energy of Elios desire </v>

91
00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.270
<v Speaker 2>and how that manifests.</v>

92
00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:55.183
<v Speaker 2>These unusual structures are so </v>
<v Speaker 2>important because narrative art is one </v>

93
00:06:58.551 --> 00:07:03.551
<v Speaker 2>of the ways in which we model our own </v>
<v Speaker 2>lives and there can be falseness in what</v>

94
00:07:04.701 --> 00:07:05.534
<v Speaker 2>is sometimes called Hollywood films that</v>
<v Speaker 2>influences our expectations of </v>

95
00:07:09.861 --> 00:07:11.420
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For instance,</v>

96
00:07:11.421 --> 00:07:13.220
<v Speaker 2>the whole time I was watching call me by</v>
<v Speaker 2>your name.</v>

97
00:07:13.221 --> 00:07:14.054
<v Speaker 2>I was anxious for the person or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>institution that would inevitably </v>

98
00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:18.433
<v Speaker 2>challenge Elio and Oliver is affair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something I'd come to expect in </v>

99
00:07:21.711 --> 00:07:22.544
<v Speaker 2>films and stories of this kind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when that didn't happen and I </v>

100
00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:26.623
<v Speaker 2>released that pent up energy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a revolutionary feeling like the </v>

101
00:07:29.991 --> 00:07:34.380
<v Speaker 2>film was opening up a new corner of life</v>
<v Speaker 2>differently to see things,</v>

102
00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:36.383
<v Speaker 2>see without my eyes first time that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have to understand these films or </v>

103
00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.500
<v Speaker 2>these directors to enjoy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Call me by your name.</v>

104
00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:47.783
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this lineage is built around the notion </v>

105
00:07:50.221 --> 00:07:55.080
<v Speaker 2>that you can have a radical effect on </v>
<v Speaker 2>viewers without a radical style.</v>

106
00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.000
<v Speaker 2>I think why Denino's sin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ophelia?</v>

107
00:07:57.001 --> 00:07:57.834
<v Speaker 2>His love of films is the very best kind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't exclude people for not being </v>

108
00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:02.903
<v Speaker 2>in the know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It brings influences together in the </v>

109
00:08:05.941 --> 00:08:09.520
<v Speaker 2>service of a brand new style to </v>
<v Speaker 2>appreciate it.</v>

110
00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:21.180
<v Speaker 2>Hey everybody,</v>
