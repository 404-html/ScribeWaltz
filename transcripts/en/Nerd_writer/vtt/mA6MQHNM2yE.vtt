1
00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:04.643
<v Speaker 1>Secondary worlds are fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's no surprise that we're obsessed </v>

2
00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:11.040
<v Speaker 1>with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we want to explore them,</v>

3
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.920
<v Speaker 1>learn more about how they work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take a look at this app.</v>

4
00:00:13.921 --> 00:00:16.950
<v Speaker 1>Google chrome made for the release of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the hobbit films.</v>

5
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.190
<v Speaker 1>It's a hyper realistic rendering of </v>
<v Speaker 1>middle earth,</v>

6
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.220
<v Speaker 1>far from the sketches of tolkien himself</v>
<v Speaker 1>farther still from the words you used to</v>

7
00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:26.124
<v Speaker 1>describe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The chrome program can be considered an </v>

8
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.650
<v Speaker 1>act of world building,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an extension of tolkiens own world,</v>

9
00:00:31.651 --> 00:00:35.410
<v Speaker 1>building in the Lord of the rings and </v>
<v Speaker 1>more intensely in the silmarillion.</v>

10
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.510
<v Speaker 1>There's something so in chanting in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>complexity of his vision,</v>

11
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.840
<v Speaker 1>in its completeness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the completeness of the languages and</v>

12
00:00:42.841 --> 00:00:46.320
<v Speaker 1>the fact that they work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's impossible when reading Lord of the</v>

13
00:00:46.321 --> 00:00:47.154
<v Speaker 1>Rings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to feel that middle earth is </v>

14
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:49.883
<v Speaker 1>autonomous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it exists despite your reading </v>

15
00:00:52.621 --> 00:00:53.454
<v Speaker 1>about these days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have our pick of dense secondary </v>

16
00:00:55.651 --> 00:00:58.230
<v Speaker 1>world fantasy literature is filled with </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

17
00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.093
<v Speaker 1>Think of the Dune series or Narnia or </v>
<v Speaker 1>the late Terry Pratchett's discworld </v>

18
00:01:02.761 --> 00:01:03.594
<v Speaker 1>novels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think of the race to fill in the </v>

19
00:01:04.531 --> 00:01:06.990
<v Speaker 1>histories of star wars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in books,</v>

20
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.820
<v Speaker 1>video games,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and new films,</v>

21
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:09.803
<v Speaker 1>or take the secondary world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're most obsessed with at the moment </v>

22
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.650
<v Speaker 1>the world of Westeros in George Rr </v>
<v Speaker 1>Martin is a song of ice and fire.</v>

23
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.513
<v Speaker 1>None of these worlds are our own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but each is internally consistent and </v>

24
00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.520
<v Speaker 1>each has developed audiences that hunger</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the author to fill in the margins,</v>

25
00:01:26.521 --> 00:01:28.170
<v Speaker 1>the gaps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the geography,</v>

26
00:01:28.171 --> 00:01:29.790
<v Speaker 1>the backstories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the histories,</v>

27
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.580
<v Speaker 1>and if the author won't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll do it themselves.</v>

28

29
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.880
<v Speaker 1>perhaps the most exhaustive catalog of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>secondary world ever made.</v>

30
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.910
<v Speaker 1>Why are we so consumed by built worlds </v>
<v Speaker 1>by the act of world building?</v>

31
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.460
<v Speaker 1>Is this a generous obsession or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous one?</v>

32
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.313
<v Speaker 1>The great science fiction and fantasy </v>
<v Speaker 1>writer m John Harrison once famously </v>

33
00:01:54.721 --> 00:01:55.554
<v Speaker 1>called world building the attempt to </v>
<v Speaker 1>exhaustively survey a place that isn't </v>

34
00:02:00.181 --> 00:02:00.480
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

35
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.290
<v Speaker 1>Harrison's point is that the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>building of much fantastic fiction which</v>

36
00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:07.410
<v Speaker 1>takes toll keens legendary them as its </v>
<v Speaker 1>archetype,</v>

37
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.513
<v Speaker 1>shifts the focus of literature away from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the act which is most vital to its </v>

38
00:02:13.591 --> 00:02:14.424
<v Speaker 1>usefulness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The act of reading world building in </v>

39
00:02:16.891 --> 00:02:17.724
<v Speaker 1>this view assumes a passive reader.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It envisions a writer who photographs a </v>

40
00:02:22.231 --> 00:02:23.064
<v Speaker 1>secondary world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>encodes it into language and a reader </v>

41
00:02:25.621 --> 00:02:26.454
<v Speaker 1>who receives this immersive experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a film blissfully and perhaps </v>

42
00:02:30.961 --> 00:02:35.940
<v Speaker 1>willingly unaware that the world he </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences is a rhetorical construct.</v>

43
00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.590
<v Speaker 1>The only problem is that all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>assumptions are based on false premises.</v>

44
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.880
<v Speaker 1>You can't encode the world in language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Readers are never passive.</v>

45
00:02:44.881 --> 00:02:47.370
<v Speaker 1>They create the text as much as a writer</v>
<v Speaker 1>does,</v>

46
00:02:47.371 --> 00:02:51.840
<v Speaker 1>and all texts are rhetorical constructs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

47
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.943
<v Speaker 1>writing is always a game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a transaction that emerges from a </v>

48
00:02:57.841 --> 00:03:01.750
<v Speaker 1>writer's implications and a readers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interpretive toolbox.</v>

49
00:03:01.751 --> 00:03:04.720
<v Speaker 1>World building fiction seems to deny </v>
<v Speaker 1>this transaction,</v>

50
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.700
<v Speaker 1>replace it with a cleaner one in which </v>
<v Speaker 1>the story on offer is like a clock,</v>

51
00:03:09.701 --> 00:03:12.190
<v Speaker 1>and the writer is like the clockmaker.</v>

52
00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:13.323
<v Speaker 1>The problem is that this kind of fiction</v>
<v Speaker 1>creates a dependency in the reader to </v>

53
00:03:16.661 --> 00:03:18.910
<v Speaker 1>know more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to know everything.</v>

54
00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.760
<v Speaker 1>I feel this way all the time when I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching game of thrones,</v>

55
00:03:21.761 --> 00:03:25.060
<v Speaker 1>it's what sends me online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Looking for backstories.</v>

56
00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.750
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps this is why Harrison's own take </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the fantasy genre is great.</v>

57
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:29.793
<v Speaker 1>Viera conium novels resists so </v>
<v Speaker 1>forcefully this urge for dependency in </v>

58
00:03:34.061 --> 00:03:34.894
<v Speaker 1>Veera conium.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing is ever the same twice from </v>

59
00:03:37.181 --> 00:03:39.100
<v Speaker 1>story to story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Names change.</v>

60
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.530
<v Speaker 1>History's changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Characters recur,</v>

61
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.980
<v Speaker 1>but it's never clear if they're the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>people you met before.</v>

62
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.240
<v Speaker 1>Like all books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vira.</v>

63
00:03:46.241 --> 00:03:48.760
<v Speaker 1>Conium is just some words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>says Harrison.</v>

64
00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.190
<v Speaker 1>There is no place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no society,</v>

65
00:03:51.191 --> 00:03:56.191
<v Speaker 1>no dependable furniture to make real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't read it for that stuff,</v>

66
00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.020
<v Speaker 1>so you have to read it for everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

67
00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.960
<v Speaker 1>Everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the bill of goods.</v>

68
00:04:01.961 --> 00:04:06.961
<v Speaker 1>The ideas and insights that spring forth</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the explosive act of reading the.</v>

69
00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.853
<v Speaker 1>For the record,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think toking did offer that bill of </v>

70
00:04:11.231 --> 00:04:13.480
<v Speaker 1>goods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He offered a poetic utterance,</v>

71
00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:14.373
<v Speaker 1>a metaphor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the attempt of those who came </v>

72
00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:17.223
<v Speaker 1>after to literalize that metaphor and </v>
<v Speaker 1>dilute its imagery by asking things </v>

73
00:04:21.701 --> 00:04:24.550
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did sal ron look like?</v>

74
00:04:24.551 --> 00:04:28.060
<v Speaker 1>Or just how might an Elf regiment </v>
<v Speaker 1>organize itself.</v>

75
00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.953
<v Speaker 1>It's important to note that world </v>
<v Speaker 1>building is not exclusive to fantastic </v>

76
00:04:32.081 --> 00:04:32.914
<v Speaker 1>fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a staple of real world fiction as </v>

77
00:04:35.381 --> 00:04:37.690
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and indeed the real world.</v>

78
00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.530
<v Speaker 1>It's current popularity is unsurprising </v>
<v Speaker 1>given our modern world,</v>

79
00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:45.010
<v Speaker 1>which is its own kind of fantasy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indeed.</v>

80
00:04:45.011 --> 00:04:48.460
<v Speaker 1>This is what makes world building so </v>
<v Speaker 1>potentially dangerous.</v>

81
00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:49.413
<v Speaker 1>The world building of fiction only </v>
<v Speaker 1>greases the wheels for it's much more </v>

82
00:04:52.901 --> 00:04:53.734
<v Speaker 1>insidious and terrifying cousin </v>
<v Speaker 1>political pro building the constructed </v>

83
00:04:58.421 --> 00:05:01.750
<v Speaker 1>world presented to us by politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>marketing,</v>

84
00:05:01.751 --> 00:05:02.584
<v Speaker 1>and the media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The act of narcissistic fantasy </v>

85
00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:05.373
<v Speaker 1>represented by the word l'oreal already </v>
<v Speaker 1>exists well upstream of j Dot k rowling </v>

86
00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:12.190
<v Speaker 1>or Jrr tolkien.</v>

87
00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:13.263
<v Speaker 1>Neither of them is anywhere near as </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful at world-building as the </v>

88
00:05:16.871 --> 00:05:20.920
<v Speaker 1>geniuses who devised coke or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Catholic church.</v>

89
00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:25.690
<v Speaker 1>I am a huge fan of totalking and game of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thrones and star wars,</v>

90
00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:27.003
<v Speaker 1>but I'm also wary and worried about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>strain of passivity and people that </v>

91
00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:32.623
<v Speaker 1>world building fiction seems to best </v>
<v Speaker 1>reflect and at worst encourage who we </v>

92
00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.560
<v Speaker 1>are is already hugely and powerfully </v>
<v Speaker 1>managed by interested parties all around</v>

93
00:05:45.161 --> 00:05:45.994
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we all at least to seek out </v>

94
00:05:47.381 --> 00:05:49.540
<v Speaker 1>fiction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fantastic or otherwise.</v>

95
00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:54.870
<v Speaker 1>That's a bit more impish and challenging</v>
<v Speaker 1>that demands our engagement that rattles</v>

96
00:05:55.811 --> 00:06:00.260
<v Speaker 1>our perspective and exposes the false </v>
<v Speaker 1>fronts of the fantasy.</v>

97
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:05.290
<v Speaker 1>We were born into the world that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>built without our consent.</v>

98
00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:07.940
