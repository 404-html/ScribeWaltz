1
00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:06.243
<v Speaker 1>I can't quite believe that three years </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago I began my life as a youtuber with </v>

2
00:00:11.141 --> 00:00:14.820
<v Speaker 1>this video explaining that I had become </v>
<v Speaker 1>disillusioned with filmmaking,</v>

3
00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.890
<v Speaker 1>my major at school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and wanted to become a novelist.</v>

4
00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.040
<v Speaker 1>The plan back then was to follow the </v>
<v Speaker 1>example of John Green,</v>

5
00:00:21.041 --> 00:00:24.670
<v Speaker 1>who is just then finishing the fault in </v>
<v Speaker 1>our stars because morning it's Monday.</v>

6
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.450
<v Speaker 1>The vlogs purpose was to find an </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience for a novel I had written while</v>

7
00:00:28.451 --> 00:00:31.540
<v Speaker 1>living in Paris and hoped at some point </v>
<v Speaker 1>to publish.</v>

8
00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.850
<v Speaker 1>A couple of weeks later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I came up with the name.</v>

9
00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:34.713
<v Speaker 1>Here's my thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm an editor and a writer and they're </v>

10
00:00:37.841 --> 00:00:40.210
<v Speaker 1>fighting writer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a nerd writer these days.</v>

11
00:00:40.211 --> 00:00:41.044
<v Speaker 1>Youtube is like the wild west of media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even the ones who've made it can't </v>

12
00:00:44.351 --> 00:00:48.790
<v Speaker 1>quite conceive of their profession </v>
<v Speaker 1>because whenever they started doing what</v>

13
00:00:48.791 --> 00:00:50.650
<v Speaker 1>they're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it didn't exist.</v>

14
00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.840
<v Speaker 1>At least that's been the experience for </v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

15
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.570
<v Speaker 1>Early on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew that what I was doing here as the</v>

16
00:00:55.571 --> 00:00:56.404
<v Speaker 1>nerd writer was more exciting and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fulfilling than any other work in my </v>

17
00:00:58.901 --> 00:01:02.010
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but exactly what it was alluded.</v>

18
00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.240
<v Speaker 1>So today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

19
00:01:04.241 --> 00:01:05.074
<v Speaker 1>three years later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to update the mission statement </v>

20
00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:08.283
<v Speaker 1>of this project.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we do here besides talk with our </v>

21
00:01:10.721 --> 00:01:13.690
<v Speaker 1>hands a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is cultivate worldview.</v>

22
00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.150
<v Speaker 1>I think those two words sum it up </v>
<v Speaker 1>nicely.</v>

23
00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.440
<v Speaker 1>Worldview is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you know,</v>

24
00:01:17.441 --> 00:01:18.274
<v Speaker 1>a particular philosophy of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It implies the entirety of what we </v>

25
00:01:21.371 --> 00:01:24.190
<v Speaker 1>comprehend and believe about the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about ourselves,</v>

26
00:01:24.191 --> 00:01:28.150
<v Speaker 1>about how each interacts with the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It suggests a commitment,</v>

27
00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.940
<v Speaker 1>a modest one to the well rounded </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual,</v>

28
00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.830
<v Speaker 1>the intellectual life we at the nerd </v>
<v Speaker 1>writer are men and women of letters.</v>

29
00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.520
<v Speaker 1>As Taran said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing human is foreign to us.</v>

30
00:01:39.521 --> 00:01:42.370
<v Speaker 1>We recognize that life is philosophical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>moral,</v>

31
00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:43.930
<v Speaker 1>political,</v>
<v Speaker 1>financial,</v>

32
00:01:43.931 --> 00:01:45.160
<v Speaker 1>psychological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>artistic,</v>

33
00:01:45.161 --> 00:01:45.994
<v Speaker 1>scientific,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that what is worth knowing is worth </v>

34
00:01:47.771 --> 00:01:51.160
<v Speaker 1>weaving into a complex and comprehensive</v>
<v Speaker 1>web.</v>

35
00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:52.023
<v Speaker 1>That's what goes on here at the nerd </v>
<v Speaker 1>writer and it's a process that takes </v>

36
00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:55.593
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I researched right film and edit this </v>

37
00:01:57.041 --> 00:02:01.240
<v Speaker 1>project by myself and the free time I </v>
<v Speaker 1>have after working a full time day job,</v>

38
00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.590
<v Speaker 1>but my dream is to do this with you full</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

39
00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:06.453
<v Speaker 1>I've set up an account on Patrion.com</v>
<v Speaker 1>and today I'm asking for your help to </v>

40
00:02:09.761 --> 00:02:12.220
<v Speaker 1>keep this project going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't know what Patrion is,</v>

41
00:02:12.221 --> 00:02:16.660
<v Speaker 1>it's a really cool way for fans to </v>
<v Speaker 1>become patrons of the content they love.</v>

42
00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.990
<v Speaker 1>The way it works is like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you become a patron of an artist,</v>

43
00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.090
<v Speaker 1>you're agreeing to give that artist a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tip.</v>

44
00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.400
<v Speaker 1>Every time they release a piece of </v>
<v Speaker 1>content.</v>

45
00:02:24.401 --> 00:02:25.234
<v Speaker 1>For the nerd writer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you can expect is three to four </v>

46
00:02:26.921 --> 00:02:29.260
<v Speaker 1>videos a month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maximum four,</v>

47
00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.123
<v Speaker 1>so if you pledge $1,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say that means you're going to be </v>

48
00:02:32.111 --> 00:02:35.050
<v Speaker 1>spending somewhere between three to $4 a</v>
<v Speaker 1>month.</v>

49
00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.920
<v Speaker 1>It's important to note that the nerd </v>
<v Speaker 1>writer will always be free.</v>

50
00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:39.783
<v Speaker 1>You will always be able to access this </v>
<v Speaker 1>channel and the videos here without </v>

51
00:02:43.241 --> 00:02:44.074
<v Speaker 1>charge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is just for people who have the </v>

52
00:02:45.341 --> 00:02:48.130
<v Speaker 1>ability and the desire to help support </v>
<v Speaker 1>this channel.</v>

53
00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't want anyone stretching their </v>
<v Speaker 1>budgets if they can't afford it.</v>

54
00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:52.143
<v Speaker 1>For those of you who donate $1,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll get a text mention at the end of </v>

55
00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.180
<v Speaker 1>all my following videos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For those of you who donate $3,</v>

56
00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.920
<v Speaker 1>you'll get a personal type written poem </v>
<v Speaker 1>by me sent to your house.</v>

57
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.910
<v Speaker 1>For those of you who donate $5,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is by far my favorite.</v>

58
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:07.773
<v Speaker 1>You can get a limited edition nerd </v>
<v Speaker 1>writer Mug at matches the Mug logo at </v>

59
00:03:12.191 --> 00:03:14.980
<v Speaker 1>the beginning of my videos or other perk</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>

60
00:03:14.981 --> 00:03:16.540
<v Speaker 1>I want to know what you think they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>for you.</v>

61
00:03:16.541 --> 00:03:17.374
<v Speaker 1>So I think she'd probably have a say in </v>
<v Speaker 1>what they are giving me suggestions in </v>

62
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.273
<v Speaker 1>the comments here at the nerd writer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We think and speak critically </v>

63
00:03:24.611 --> 00:03:27.010
<v Speaker 1>dispassionately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>precisely as we can.</v>

64
00:03:27.011 --> 00:03:30.250
<v Speaker 1>We try to see the world and ourselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>for what they are.</v>

65
00:03:30.251 --> 00:03:31.084
<v Speaker 1>We try to think about how we would like </v>
<v Speaker 1>them to be and why it is we would like </v>

66
00:03:34.241 --> 00:03:35.074
<v Speaker 1>them to be that way and we think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking to hear we cultivate worldview </v>

67
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.330
<v Speaker 1>and have had a fucking good time doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

68
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.290
<v Speaker 1>So thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And coffee on a Tuesday.</v>
