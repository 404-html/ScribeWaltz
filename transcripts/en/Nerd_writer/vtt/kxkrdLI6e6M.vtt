<v Speaker 1>Dark patterns are features of interface </v>
<v Speaker 1>design,</v>

2
00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:16.250
<v Speaker 1>crafted to trick users into doing things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they might not want to do,</v>

3
00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:18.620
<v Speaker 1>but which benefit the business in </v>
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>

4
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.993
<v Speaker 1>here's an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever tried to delete your </v>

5
00:00:22.371 --> 00:00:24.890
<v Speaker 1>Amazon account?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the Amazon homepage.</v>

6
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.780
<v Speaker 1>What's the first thing you might think </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do?</v>

7
00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.050
<v Speaker 1>The obvious place to look is the account</v>
<v Speaker 1>drop down here.</v>

8
00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:31.850
<v Speaker 1>Once you're in here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look around.</v>

9
00:00:31.851 --> 00:00:32.684
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if I'm interested in deleting my </v>

10
00:00:34.551 --> 00:00:35.384
<v Speaker 1>account,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that your account is probably a </v>

11
00:00:37.491 --> 00:00:39.620
<v Speaker 1>good place to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once I'm on this page,</v>

12
00:00:39.621 --> 00:00:41.750
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot more information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>payment options,</v>

13
00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.480
<v Speaker 1>logging insecurity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a bunch of stuff down here.</v>

14
00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:45.583
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could click every link on your </v>

15
00:00:47.361 --> 00:00:48.194
<v Speaker 1>account page,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but none would deliver you to a place </v>

16
00:00:49.731 --> 00:00:52.220
<v Speaker 1>where you could actually delete it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's not here.</v>

17
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.350
<v Speaker 1>In order to actually delete your Amazon </v>
<v Speaker 1>account,</v>

18
00:00:54.351 --> 00:00:57.500
<v Speaker 1>you have to go all the way down to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom of the page and under.</v>

19
00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.410
<v Speaker 1>Let us help you click help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you're in here,</v>

20
00:01:00.411 --> 00:01:03.700
<v Speaker 1>you have to navigate to need more help </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>

21
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.870
<v Speaker 1>putting it on this page would just be </v>
<v Speaker 1>too easy.</v>

22
00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.973
<v Speaker 1>Then click contact us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is where it starts to get </v>

23
00:01:08.751 --> 00:01:10.760
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous and it's still nowhere to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>seen,</v>

24
00:01:10.761 --> 00:01:12.410
<v Speaker 1>but of the four options on the top of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

25
00:01:12.411 --> 00:01:15.770
<v Speaker 1>you want help with click prime or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something else.</v>

26
00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.020
<v Speaker 1>You want this something else in this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell us more about your issue dropdown.</v>

27
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.190
<v Speaker 1>There's still nothing that suggests </v>
<v Speaker 1>account deletion.</v>

28
00:01:22.191 --> 00:01:25.490
<v Speaker 1>You just have to know to click login and</v>
<v Speaker 1>security,</v>

29
00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.960
<v Speaker 1>and then in a second dropdown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there it is the magic button.</v>

30
00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.570
<v Speaker 1>Close my account,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except in order to actually do that,</v>

31
00:01:32.571 --> 00:01:33.404
<v Speaker 1>you have to have a chat conversation </v>
<v Speaker 1>with an Amazon associate who's going to </v>

32
00:01:35.571 --> 00:01:38.390
<v Speaker 1>tell you all the reasons I count.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Deletion is a bad idea.</v>

33
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.420
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't delete the account yourself.</v>

34
00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.090
<v Speaker 1>They have to do it for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a dark pattern,</v>

35
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.810
<v Speaker 1>a crappy user experience that </v>
<v Speaker 1>intentionally makes it difficult,</v>

36
00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:48.703
<v Speaker 1>almost impossible without help to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that hurts Amazon ux </v>

37
00:01:52.521 --> 00:01:54.980
<v Speaker 1>specialists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Harry brignull categorizes this specific</v>

38
00:01:54.981 --> 00:01:59.981
<v Speaker 1>kind of dark pattern as a roach motel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a design that makes it very easy for you</v>

39
00:02:00.201 --> 00:02:03.620
<v Speaker 1>to get into a situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but very hard to get out.</v>

40
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.640
<v Speaker 1>Brignull is actually the one who coined </v>
<v Speaker 1>the term dark pattern in 2010,</v>

41
00:02:07.641 --> 00:02:10.580
<v Speaker 1>and he's been cataloging and lecturing </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the issue ever since.</v>

42
00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.300
<v Speaker 1>Many of these dark patterns we're all </v>
<v Speaker 1>familiar with and only have to search my</v>

43
00:02:14.301 --> 00:02:16.970
<v Speaker 1>email for a few seconds to find one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

44
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.863
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting spam emails from </v>

45
00:02:18.921 --> 00:02:23.210
<v Speaker 1>architectural digest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I scroll down and look at that.</v>

46
00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.540
<v Speaker 1>This is a mess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a mess on purpose.</v>

47
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.200
<v Speaker 1>The unsubscribe link is here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's devilishly hard to see.</v>

48
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.283
<v Speaker 1>That's because it's the same font and </v>
<v Speaker 1>virtually the same color as the rest of </v>

49
00:02:33.891 --> 00:02:34.724
<v Speaker 1>the fine print.</v>

50
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.833
<v Speaker 1>Here's another dark pattern that uses </v>
<v Speaker 1>color to misdirect over at the user </v>

51
00:02:38.241 --> 00:02:39.074
<v Speaker 1>testing blog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jennifer Jerome points out that the </v>

52
00:02:40.401 --> 00:02:41.234
<v Speaker 1>mobile game two dots carries you through</v>
<v Speaker 1>the experience by offering green </v>

53
00:02:44.961 --> 00:02:47.060
<v Speaker 1>buttons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a green button to start the game,</v>

54
00:02:47.061 --> 00:02:47.894
<v Speaker 1>a green button to pick a level of green </v>
<v Speaker 1>button to start the level and three </v>

55
00:02:50.661 --> 00:02:53.360
<v Speaker 1>green buttons to continue to the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>level and so,</v>

56
00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.840
<v Speaker 1>but once you lose a level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the color scheme changes.</v>

57
00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.853
<v Speaker 1>The first screen button you see leads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you right an in app purchase while the </v>

58
00:03:00.791 --> 00:03:04.810
<v Speaker 1>continue button is just a little x that </v>
<v Speaker 1>blends into the larger element.</v>

59
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:05.703
<v Speaker 1>I wonder how many people clicked by </v>
<v Speaker 1>moves reflexively as a Pedalo vion </v>

60
00:03:08.681 --> 00:03:10.210
<v Speaker 1>response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

61
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.550
<v Speaker 1>to be fair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a pretty benign dark pattern,</v>

62
00:03:12.551 --> 00:03:13.384
<v Speaker 1>but it shows how companies can use </v>
<v Speaker 1>something as simple as color to trick </v>

63
00:03:16.001 --> 00:03:16.834
<v Speaker 1>you into doing what they want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the more egregious end of the </v>

64
00:03:18.761 --> 00:03:19.594
<v Speaker 1>spectrum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have stuff like this banner ad for </v>

65
00:03:21.221 --> 00:03:24.610
<v Speaker 1>chat most which is made to look like it </v>
<v Speaker 1>has a speck of dust on it,</v>

66
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.390
<v Speaker 1>causing people to brush it away and </v>
<v Speaker 1>accidentally clicked the link.</v>

67
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:29.553
<v Speaker 1>Or you have sites like booking.com</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they do everything in their power </v>

68
00:03:32.861 --> 00:03:33.694
<v Speaker 1>to increase the urgency of a purchase </v>
<v Speaker 1>going so far as to alert you in big red </v>

69
00:03:38.441 --> 00:03:43.390
<v Speaker 1>notifications of the hotel rooms that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you just missed you better book.</v>

70
00:03:43.391 --> 00:03:45.610
<v Speaker 1>Now you don't want to be left behind </v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

71
00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:46.473
<v Speaker 1>do you every once in a while a company </v>
<v Speaker 1>goes a little too far and actually </v>

72
00:03:49.451 --> 00:03:50.284
<v Speaker 1>breaks the law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember when you used to get spammed </v>

73
00:03:51.641 --> 00:03:53.860
<v Speaker 1>with all those linkedin invites from </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends?</v>

74
00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.963
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was because of a confusing dark </v>

75
00:03:55.781 --> 00:03:58.810
<v Speaker 1>pattern on there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Add contacts page which allowed linkedin</v>

76
00:03:58.811 --> 00:03:59.644
<v Speaker 1>to scoop up people's email contacts and </v>
<v Speaker 1>send them messages repeatedly without </v>

77
00:04:03.581 --> 00:04:06.100
<v Speaker 1>their consent and a comprehensive blog </v>
<v Speaker 1>post stand.</v>

78
00:04:06.101 --> 00:04:06.934
<v Speaker 1>Schlosser showed how linkedin tried to </v>
<v Speaker 1>trick users eat times and their sign up </v>

79
00:04:10.871 --> 00:04:14.140
<v Speaker 1>and onboarding procedures into </v>
<v Speaker 1>surrendering their email contacts.</v>

80
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.870
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately for Linkedin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this proved to be a step too far.</v>

81
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.010
<v Speaker 1>Users filed a legal challenge claiming </v>
<v Speaker 1>that sending multiple unwarranted emails</v>

82
00:04:21.011 --> 00:04:21.844
<v Speaker 1>hurt their professional reputation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Linkedin settled the dispute for $13 </v>

83
00:04:24.851 --> 00:04:25.684
<v Speaker 1>million dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which came out in the end to about $10 </v>

84
00:04:28.391 --> 00:04:29.224
<v Speaker 1>per user.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's rare for dark patterns to face </v>

85
00:04:31.481 --> 00:04:35.650
<v Speaker 1>consequences like these mostly they stay</v>
<v Speaker 1>just on the right side of the law,</v>

86
00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:36.573
<v Speaker 1>understanding that it's hard to </v>
<v Speaker 1>legislate around the psychological </v>

87
00:04:39.011 --> 00:04:39.844
<v Speaker 1>tricks of Ux design.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything on the Internet is fighting </v>

88
00:04:42.791 --> 00:04:43.624
<v Speaker 1>for your attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a difference between those </v>

89
00:04:45.461 --> 00:04:46.294
<v Speaker 1>who are taking the time to build trust </v>
<v Speaker 1>and loyalty and the special offer you </v>

90
00:04:50.111 --> 00:04:50.944
<v Speaker 1>clicked which actually enrolled you in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>monthly subscription or the social </v>

91
00:04:53.771 --> 00:04:54.604
<v Speaker 1>network,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that dark pattern you until letting it </v>

92
00:04:56.251 --> 00:04:58.570
<v Speaker 1>cell data that you didn't even know it </v>
<v Speaker 1>had.</v>

93
00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:59.613
<v Speaker 1>Some of the responsibility is on us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some is on design too and it's not </v>

94
00:05:03.671 --> 00:05:04.504
<v Speaker 1>the fault of the designers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just doing what they're tasked </v>

95
00:05:06.311 --> 00:05:08.350
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Knowing full well that if they don't,</v>

96
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.600
<v Speaker 1>others will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as bricknell says,</v>

97
00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:11.463
<v Speaker 1>our best defense against the dark </v>
<v Speaker 1>patterns is to be aware of them and </v>

98
00:05:15.011 --> 00:05:15.844
<v Speaker 1>shame the companies who utilize them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Design is what mediates our interaction </v>

99
00:05:19.721 --> 00:05:22.150
<v Speaker 1>with the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the language we read it in.</v>

100
00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.280
<v Speaker 1>It's not too much to ask that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>language be comprehensible and</v>

101
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.980
<v Speaker 1>hey everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you so much for watching.</v>

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:41.603

107
00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:58.333
<v Speaker 1>I've had a few hacking scare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so vpns really helped ease my mind when </v>

108
00:06:01.911 --> 00:06:05.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm online and Nord.</v>
<v Speaker 1>VPN is the best out there.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I've shopped around in this space and </v>
<v Speaker 1>use a few vpns,</v>

113
00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:23.270
<v Speaker 1>nor vpn is definitely my favorite by a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mile.</v>

114
00:06:23.271 --> 00:06:24.104
