00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:03.900
<v Speaker 1>Coffee on a Tuesday in block 35,</v>

2
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:15.933
<v Speaker 1>so there's a way to use hashtags to </v>
<v Speaker 1>categorize tweets or messages so that </v>

3
00:00:18.701 --> 00:00:23.470
<v Speaker 1>they show up more easily in searches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't ever use hashtags like that.</v>

4
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.000
<v Speaker 1>There are amazing political consequences</v>
<v Speaker 1>to Hashtags,</v>

5
00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.520
<v Speaker 1>fast and easy ways to communicate to </v>
<v Speaker 1>find information on a particular subject</v>

6
00:00:30.521 --> 00:00:34.420
<v Speaker 1>or event like a riot or a revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't ever use hashtags like that.</v>

7
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.670
<v Speaker 1>The hashtag was thriving when I came to </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

8
00:00:36.671 --> 00:00:37.504
<v Speaker 1>People were already using it for all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those democratizing reasons I just </v>

9
00:00:40.061 --> 00:00:42.250
<v Speaker 1>mentioned as a way of networking or </v>
<v Speaker 1>advocating,</v>

10
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.850
<v Speaker 1>but the networking function of hashtags </v>
<v Speaker 1>never really interested me,</v>

11
00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:46.713
<v Speaker 1>but I noticed that people were using </v>
<v Speaker 1>hashtags in other ways to to express </v>

12
00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.650
<v Speaker 1>sarcasm or wit or inner monologue or </v>
<v Speaker 1>self deprecation and I thought I can get</v>

13
00:00:56.231 --> 00:00:57.064
<v Speaker 1>into that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first Hashtag I ever used was on an </v>

14
00:00:58.511 --> 00:01:00.450
<v Speaker 1>instagram photo I took in La.</v>

15
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:01.553
<v Speaker 1>Have a man who was dressed up as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>yellow transformer who is done with his </v>

16
00:01:05.771 --> 00:01:09.250
<v Speaker 1>day just walking home from work in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>costume.</v>

17
00:01:09.251 --> 00:01:11.980
<v Speaker 1>My caption was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>melancholy transformer.</v>

18
00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.840
<v Speaker 1>Hashtag save.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

19
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.810
<v Speaker 1>so at the expense of murdering comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by analyzing it,</v>

20
00:01:16.811 --> 00:01:20.860
<v Speaker 1>I was making a joke here about a man </v>
<v Speaker 1>whose jobs seemed to be to dress up in a</v>

21
00:01:20.861 --> 00:01:21.694
<v Speaker 1>bulky transformers costume and walk </v>
<v Speaker 1>around the streets of La and he didn't </v>

22
00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:27.160
<v Speaker 1>seem too happy about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And hashtag save yourself.</v>

23
00:01:27.161 --> 00:01:29.620
<v Speaker 1>It's just a way of saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do better than this.</v>

24
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:30.603
<v Speaker 1>Just for a moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's disregard all the ridiculous </v>

25
00:01:31.961 --> 00:01:32.794
<v Speaker 1>assumptions I'm making about this guy's </v>
<v Speaker 1>life who I know nothing about who very </v>

26
00:01:35.171 --> 00:01:37.780
<v Speaker 1>well might love it's June,</v>
<v Speaker 1>may very well just have gotten back from</v>

27
00:01:37.781 --> 00:01:39.190
<v Speaker 1>transformers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cope very well,</v>

28
00:01:39.191 --> 00:01:40.024
<v Speaker 1>might have a perfectly normal fetish for</v>
<v Speaker 1>dressing up as bubble who may very well </v>

29
00:01:42.431 --> 00:01:44.020
<v Speaker 1>be a transforming android.</v>

30
00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.350
<v Speaker 1>Now I could've just said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>save yourself no Hashtag,</v>

31
00:01:47.351 --> 00:01:48.184
<v Speaker 1>and the message I was trying to convey </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this guy's life would have gotten </v>

32
00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.970
<v Speaker 1>across.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I'm interested in is whether or not</v>

33
00:01:51.971 --> 00:01:56.380
<v Speaker 1>the addition of a Hashtag as any </v>
<v Speaker 1>literary value to the sentiment,</v>

34
00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.420
<v Speaker 1>and I think it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was mocking,</v>

35
00:01:58.421 --> 00:01:59.254
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>borrowing the intended function of </v>

36
00:02:01.961 --> 00:02:02.794
<v Speaker 1>hashtags as a means to connect our </v>
<v Speaker 1>expression in order to add a layer of </v>

37
00:02:06.131 --> 00:02:06.964
<v Speaker 1>subtext to the company instead of just </v>
<v Speaker 1>telling this guy to get a life I was </v>

38
00:02:09.671 --> 00:02:13.720
<v Speaker 1>making like the Hashtag save yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Grouping already existed,</v>

39
00:02:13.721 --> 00:02:14.554
<v Speaker 1>that it was trending.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People were adding to it as a way to </v>

40
00:02:16.601 --> 00:02:17.434
<v Speaker 1>infer that this ridiculous thing is only</v>
<v Speaker 1>one example of millions of similarly </v>

41
00:02:22.211 --> 00:02:23.044
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe even a ridiculous thing that you </v>

42
00:02:25.601 --> 00:02:26.434
<v Speaker 1>do with the Hashtag you invoke the </v>
<v Speaker 1>community even when the community isn't </v>

43
00:02:30.011 --> 00:02:30.250
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

44
00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.970
<v Speaker 1>Of course I wasn't thinking this out as </v>
<v Speaker 1>I did it and the only way that I learned</v>

45
00:02:33.971 --> 00:02:34.804
<v Speaker 1>the literary way of using hashtags is by</v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing other people do it first and </v>

46
00:02:38.591 --> 00:02:39.424
<v Speaker 1>there are many other ways to use </v>
<v Speaker 1>hashtags dramatically to express self </v>

47
00:02:42.021 --> 00:02:44.860
<v Speaker 1>deprecation or inner monologue for </v>
<v Speaker 1>insecurity.</v>

48
00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:45.813
<v Speaker 1>I find it fascinating that we can't help</v>
<v Speaker 1>but repurpose everything we see into </v>

49
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.750
<v Speaker 1>stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even metadata,</v>

50
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.333
<v Speaker 1>metadata and your functions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We will take your metadata and make it </v>

51
00:02:56.981 --> 00:03:01.150
<v Speaker 1>into box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are an race to say the least and it's</v>

52
00:03:01.151 --> 00:03:04.270
<v Speaker 1>no surprise to me that twitter caught on</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it did.</v>

53
00:03:04.271 --> 00:03:05.104
<v Speaker 1>It's no surprise the effect it's already</v>
<v Speaker 1>had on the world and it's no surprise </v>

54
00:03:08.831 --> 00:03:09.664
<v Speaker 1>that we figured out how to make little </v>
<v Speaker 1>messages into big messages without ever </v>

55
00:03:14.441 --> 00:03:18.690
<v Speaker 1>changing the character counts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

56
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:19.533
<v Speaker 1>everyone and screen had been here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I wanted to let you know that we did </v>

<v Speaker 1>the one year anniversary of occupy Wall </v>

58
00:03:27.401 --> 00:03:28.234

<v Speaker 1>to videos or stories that I do on MSNBC.</v>
