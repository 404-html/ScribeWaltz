00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.330
<v Speaker 1>The first thing you notice about Michael</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mann's heat is that it's all long lenses</v>

2
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:20.673
<v Speaker 1>in a widescreen 23 by nine format meant </v>
<v Speaker 1>to allow for a broad scope so that you </v>

3
00:00:24.821 --> 00:00:25.654
<v Speaker 1>can see more man crowds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his subjects into the frame as if you </v>

4
00:00:29.771 --> 00:00:34.540
<v Speaker 1>were always watching them on a stakeout </v>
<v Speaker 1>from some hidden vantage on the building</v>

5
00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.860
<v Speaker 1>opposite the telephoto Lens is really </v>
<v Speaker 1>the perfect lens for this film.</v>

6
00:00:38.861 --> 00:00:43.060
<v Speaker 1>It has the effect of keeping everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>at a distance all at the same time,</v>

7
00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.923
<v Speaker 1>separating people from the background </v>
<v Speaker 1>while also at the same time turning the </v>

8
00:00:47.771 --> 00:00:50.620
<v Speaker 1>background into an almost liquid plane </v>
<v Speaker 1>of lights.</v>

9
00:00:50.621 --> 00:00:51.454
<v Speaker 1>Evoking that fantastical romance that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>always found in new war and which </v>

10
00:00:55.601 --> 00:00:58.870
<v Speaker 1>Michael Mann seeds in the sprawl of Los </v>
<v Speaker 1>Angeles.</v>

11
00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:00.213
<v Speaker 1>This is all to say that the telephoto </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lens is both functional and stylistic </v>

12
00:01:04.271 --> 00:01:05.104
<v Speaker 1>and he two words that could be used to </v>
<v Speaker 1>describe the driving ethos behind man's </v>

13
00:01:09.071 --> 00:01:10.450
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

14
00:01:10.451 --> 00:01:13.120
<v Speaker 1>style is never something Michael Man's </v>
<v Speaker 1>been accused of.</v>

15
00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:18.463
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's likely accusations of empty </v>

16
00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:20.834
<v Speaker 1>stylistics from the days of Miami vice </v>
<v Speaker 1>that made man insist that he wasn't a </v>

17
00:01:25.281 --> 00:01:29.300
<v Speaker 1>genre film at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it drama drawn from the stories of a</v>

18
00:01:29.301 --> 00:01:32.630
<v Speaker 1>real life detective who served as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consultant on the film,</v>

19
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.913
<v Speaker 1>and it's true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the procedural and mundane elements of </v>

20
00:01:36.471 --> 00:01:37.304
<v Speaker 1>police and criminal activity are </v>
<v Speaker 1>painstakingly rendered and heat and </v>

21
00:01:40.491 --> 00:01:44.570
<v Speaker 1>there's a pride in the fact that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>locations are real locations in La.</v>

22
00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.930
<v Speaker 1>This was an actual cardboard community </v>
<v Speaker 1>on terminal island.</v>

23
00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.030
<v Speaker 1>This train that the neuro gets out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

24
00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.893
<v Speaker 1>the Real Blue Line of the Los Angeles </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mta and his house is a real house in </v>

25
00:01:54.861 --> 00:01:55.694
<v Speaker 1>Malibu by the sea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but man can't hide his knack for and </v>

26
00:01:58.761 --> 00:01:59.594
<v Speaker 1>devotion to style.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The three locations I mentioned may be </v>

27
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:03.553
<v Speaker 1>real places,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not an accident that in the </v>

28
00:02:05.301 --> 00:02:06.134
<v Speaker 1>first a giant mound of yellow sulfur </v>
<v Speaker 1>gives the space a dreamlike quality or </v>

29
00:02:10.731 --> 00:02:14.450
<v Speaker 1>that the train platform feels both alien</v>
<v Speaker 1>and alienating.</v>

30
00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.320
<v Speaker 1>And as for Deniros home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what could call attention to itself more</v>

31
00:02:18.321 --> 00:02:22.780
<v Speaker 1>than this blue suffused box of </v>
<v Speaker 1>loneliness cribbed from Alex Coleville,</v>

32
00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.090
<v Speaker 1>1967 painting Pacific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

33
00:02:26.091 --> 00:02:30.110
<v Speaker 1>despite Michael Mann's protestations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this is not a genre piece,</v>

34
00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.340
<v Speaker 1>he is clearly drawing from both crime </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the war traditions.</v>

35
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.470
<v Speaker 1>What makes the film brilliant is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

36
00:02:36.471 --> 00:02:40.670
<v Speaker 1>uses its style and realism to comment on</v>
<v Speaker 1>each other,</v>

37
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.910
<v Speaker 1>and in doing so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>updates the genre for a new age.</v>

38
00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:45.043
<v Speaker 1>A lot of this is done through sound in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the film by the great work and Chris </v>

39
00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.780
<v Speaker 1>Jenkins sound design and Elliot Golden </v>
<v Speaker 1>Falls Score.</v>

40
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.170
<v Speaker 1>The interplay is established right at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the start as golden falls,</v>

41
00:02:54.171 --> 00:02:55.004
<v Speaker 1>spacey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>highly stylized score fades into the </v>

42
00:02:57.411 --> 00:02:58.244
<v Speaker 1>hyper real sounds of a hospital and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>exchange is in the soundtrack for the </v>

43
00:03:10.091 --> 00:03:10.924
<v Speaker 1>scene where Pachino chases down to near </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the highway man uses a joy division </v>

44
00:03:15.101 --> 00:03:19.590
<v Speaker 1>song called new dawn feeds that has a </v>
<v Speaker 1>driving rhythm that gets the moment</v>

45
00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:20.443
<v Speaker 2>perfect.</v>

46
00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:32.410
<v Speaker 1>But what I just played,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's actually not the song used in the</v>

47
00:03:32.411 --> 00:03:35.020
<v Speaker 1>movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man commissioned a cover of new dawn,</v>

48
00:03:35.021 --> 00:03:35.854
<v Speaker 1>fades by the electronic artists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>moby who super adds to this functional </v>

49
00:03:38.771 --> 00:03:41.080
<v Speaker 1>moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a layer of pure style.</v>

50
00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.213
<v Speaker 1>Listen to the difference.</v>

51
00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:54.413
<v Speaker 1>Since its beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there has been a tension and feel new </v>

52
00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:57.293
<v Speaker 1>war between realism and style.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's origins in black and white and </v>

53
00:04:01.651 --> 00:04:05.820
<v Speaker 1>harsh chiaroscuro lighting attempted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate a gritty realism,</v>

54
00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.320
<v Speaker 1>but in this lady in the implicitly </v>
<v Speaker 1>abstract nature of black and white,</v>

55
00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.190
<v Speaker 1>it created a style all its own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's values,</v>

56
00:04:14.191 --> 00:04:15.024
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're always traditional from the start </v>

57
00:04:17.051 --> 00:04:17.884
<v Speaker 1>and the war has investigated the way men</v>
<v Speaker 1>construct their identities from what </v>

58
00:04:21.631 --> 00:04:26.040
<v Speaker 1>they do that reflected the broad scope </v>
<v Speaker 1>of men in the early 20th century,</v>

59
00:04:26.041 --> 00:04:26.874
<v Speaker 1>not just cops and robbers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the rise of postmodern consumerist </v>

60
00:04:30.661 --> 00:04:31.494
<v Speaker 1>culture of new ways to build identity </v>
<v Speaker 1>that weren't from one's career or one's </v>

61
00:04:35.611 --> 00:04:36.444
<v Speaker 1>relationships made,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the crime films association with style </v>

62
00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.870
<v Speaker 1>more problematic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also more necessary.</v>

63
00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.340
<v Speaker 1>Man Confronts this head on with Deniro </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Chinos characters,</v>

64
00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.940
<v Speaker 1>Deniro style,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his slick suits his minimal empty house,</v>

65
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.600
<v Speaker 1>reflect his lifestyle of extreme </v>
<v Speaker 1>professionalism,</v>

66
00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:55.463
<v Speaker 1>matched in the actual culture of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>eighties when the film was first </v>

67
00:04:58.891 --> 00:04:59.724
<v Speaker 1>conceived,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Geno tube is placed in the actual </v>

68
00:05:01.861 --> 00:05:03.570
<v Speaker 1>home of postmodern architect.</v>

69
00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:04.523
<v Speaker 1>Thom Mayne in Santa Monica man knows </v>
<v Speaker 1>that to communicate with contemporary </v>

70
00:05:08.191 --> 00:05:09.024
<v Speaker 1>audiences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make a crime noir that is fresh and </v>

71
00:05:11.251 --> 00:05:12.084
<v Speaker 1>looks forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these stylistic choices have to be </v>

72
00:05:14.461 --> 00:05:15.294
<v Speaker 1>present.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Modern audiences firmly entrenched in </v>

73
00:05:17.701 --> 00:05:18.534
<v Speaker 1>this culture register style.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They speak themselves through style and </v>

74
00:05:22.681 --> 00:05:23.514
<v Speaker 1>it's through this attention to style </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he can finally level a critique on </v>

75
00:05:26.671 --> 00:05:28.500
<v Speaker 1>its own culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the end,</v>

76
00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:29.363
<v Speaker 1>Deniro and Pachino ultimately reject </v>
<v Speaker 1>these new forms of identity </v>

77
00:05:33.421 --> 00:05:34.254
<v Speaker 1>construction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can lounge around here on her sofa </v>

78
00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:37.733
<v Speaker 1>in her ex husband's dead tech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>post modernistic bullshit house if you </v>

79
00:05:42.661 --> 00:05:43.494
<v Speaker 1>want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they fall back on traditional </v>

80
00:05:44.791 --> 00:05:45.624
<v Speaker 1>methods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Chino looks to his work and Deniro </v>

81
00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.870
<v Speaker 1>looks to relationships.</v>

82
00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:51.410
<v Speaker 2>There's no point in going anywhere</v>

83
00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:59.210
<v Speaker 1>in this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael Man's to style in score,</v>

84
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.010
<v Speaker 1>in soundtrack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in lenses,</v>

85
00:06:01.011 --> 00:06:02.570
<v Speaker 1>in locations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in wardrobe,</v>

86
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.433
<v Speaker 1>in lighting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and his attention to realism in all </v>

87
00:06:06.141 --> 00:06:06.974
<v Speaker 1>those same categories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Serve to illustrate a new social </v>

88
00:06:11.061 --> 00:06:11.894
<v Speaker 1>environment as well as its drawbacks and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what Phil knew aura was always </v>

89
00:06:16.491 --> 00:06:17.324
<v Speaker 1>meant to do at its best show the </v>
<v Speaker 1>underside of culture and why it's </v>

90
00:06:20.991 --> 00:06:23.720
<v Speaker 1>unnecessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Extension of the reverse.</v>

91
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:27.350
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it may be the case in our modern culture</v>

92
00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:29.810
<v Speaker 1>that when the two sides are put face to </v>
<v Speaker 1>face,</v>

93
00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:35.560
<v Speaker 1>they don't look all that different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey everybody,</v>

94
00:06:38.881 --> 00:06:41.640
<v Speaker 1>thanks for watching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is one of the best crime thrillers of</v>

95
00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:43.470
<v Speaker 1>all time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No question about that.</v>

96
00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:49.620
<v Speaker 1>I just want to say that 2015 has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>the best year of my life.</v>

97
00:06:49.621 --> 00:06:50.454
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys have helped me expand this </v>

98
00:06:52.771 --> 00:06:53.604
<v Speaker 1>channel to something that I never could </v>
<v Speaker 1>have imagined that a fact that I get to </v>

99
00:06:56.581 --> 00:07:00.930
<v Speaker 1>do this full time is just beyond my </v>
<v Speaker 1>wildest dreams.</v>

100
00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:01.823
<v Speaker 1>I believe in this channel so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when the work that's happening here </v>

101
00:07:05.161 --> 00:07:08.730
<v Speaker 1>and I really believe that to exist in </v>
<v Speaker 1>2016 and beyond,</v>

102
00:07:08.731 --> 00:07:12.630
<v Speaker 1>it has to innovate and experiment and do</v>
<v Speaker 1>new things.</v>

103
00:07:12.631 --> 00:07:13.464
<v Speaker 1>And that is what I'm looking forward to </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing and looking forward to giving to </v>

104
00:07:15.571 --> 00:07:16.404
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a really special relationship </v>

105
00:07:17.731 --> 00:07:20.160
<v Speaker 1>between the people who watch this </v>
<v Speaker 1>channel pleasure,</v>

106
00:07:20.161 --> 00:07:24.600
<v Speaker 1>this channel on my patrion page and me </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's nothing in between us.</v>

107
00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:27.480
<v Speaker 1>And that's a model that I talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>after every video.</v>

108
00:07:27.481 --> 00:07:28.950
<v Speaker 1>But one that I really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

109
00:07:28.951 --> 00:07:29.784
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really believe in because this content </v>

110
00:07:31.831 --> 00:07:36.831
<v Speaker 1>is not diluted by any corporation or any</v>
<v Speaker 1>brand or anything like that.</v>

111
00:07:36.931 --> 00:07:37.650
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

112
00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:41.010
<v Speaker 1>really special and I think a new model </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the way that content can be.</v>

113
00:07:41.011 --> 00:07:41.950
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

114
00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:44.670
<v Speaker 1>I just want to say thank you for 2015.</v>
