00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:02.190
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where am I?</v>

2
00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:03.023
<v Speaker 1>Wait mcgriddles log,</v>
<v Speaker 1>11 thanksgiving time when we celebrate </v>

3
00:00:17.791 --> 00:00:19.740
<v Speaker 1>all where things were for a time for </v>
<v Speaker 1>family,</v>

4
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:20.993
<v Speaker 1>good food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a time to relax with a good football </v>

5
00:00:22.921 --> 00:00:23.754
<v Speaker 1>game and some beers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The holiday can be traced to a feast in </v>

6
00:00:26.281 --> 00:00:27.114
<v Speaker 1>16,</v>
<v Speaker 1>21 on Plymouth plantation in </v>

7
00:00:28.771 --> 00:00:29.604
<v Speaker 1>Massachusetts was a good harvest year </v>
<v Speaker 1>due in part to the corn growing skills </v>

8
00:00:32.581 --> 00:00:36.810
<v Speaker 1>taught to the settlers by squantum </v>
<v Speaker 1>pawtuxet into quote Edward winslow</v>

9
00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.440
<v Speaker 2>would be not always so plentiful as it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was at this time with us.</v>

10
00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:42.783
<v Speaker 2>Yet by the goodness of God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are so far from that we often wish </v>

11
00:00:46.871 --> 00:00:48.300
<v Speaker 2>you partakers of our planet.</v>

12
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.233
<v Speaker 1>It's at this time of year that I'm often</v>
<v Speaker 1>reminded of Robert De Niro's great </v>

13
00:00:51.461 --> 00:00:54.190
<v Speaker 1>comeback movie of 2009.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's fine.</v>

14
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.660
<v Speaker 3>No true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>true apartment and no</v>

15
00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:29.291
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

16
00:01:29.291 --> 00:01:29.561
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait.</v>

17
00:01:29.561 --> 00:01:31.060
<v Speaker 1>What the hell is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted to talk about.</v>

18
00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.780
<v Speaker 1>You're saying that I can't talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bobby [inaudible] great comeback role in</v>

19
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.850
<v Speaker 1>2009.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

20
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.153
<v Speaker 1>so there's a bill in the House of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Representatives right now called the </v>

21
00:01:40.151 --> 00:01:44.380
<v Speaker 1>Stop online piracy act or so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not many people know about it,</v>

22
00:01:44.381 --> 00:01:46.780
<v Speaker 1>but those of us who have are Horcrux is </v>
<v Speaker 1>online.</v>

23
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.120
<v Speaker 1>You know that the Internet is and why </v>
<v Speaker 1>are they doing well?</v>

24
00:01:49.121 --> 00:01:51.280
<v Speaker 1>It's because many of them believed that </v>
<v Speaker 1>this Bill Sopa,</v>

25
00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:52.143
<v Speaker 1>which the house is very quickly and </v>
<v Speaker 1>quietly trying to push through to </v>

26
00:01:53.681 --> 00:01:54.514
<v Speaker 1>passing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>represents an infringement on their </v>

27
00:01:56.171 --> 00:01:57.004
<v Speaker 1>basic rights of free speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's take a minute to understand what </v>

28
00:01:59.231 --> 00:02:01.600
<v Speaker 1>sofa is and how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Private companies,</v>

29
00:02:01.601 --> 00:02:04.000
<v Speaker 1>namely large corporations within the </v>
<v Speaker 1>entertainment industry,</v>

30
00:02:04.001 --> 00:02:05.710
<v Speaker 1>the Motion Picture Association of </v>
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>

31
00:02:05.711 --> 00:02:07.720
<v Speaker 1>the recording industry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Association of America,</v>

32
00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.780
<v Speaker 1>Netflix via content,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ability to shut down on unauthorized</v>

33
00:02:10.781 --> 00:02:13.660
<v Speaker 1>roque sites where people download tv </v>
<v Speaker 1>shows music and move.</v>

34
00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:14.553
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they already have the right to do this </v>

35
00:02:15.011 --> 00:02:17.290
<v Speaker 1>under American copyright law on an </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual basis.</v>

36
00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.153
<v Speaker 1>You may have seen this screen before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of these sites operating from </v>

37
00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.110
<v Speaker 1>outside the US and so are in each </v>
<v Speaker 1>jurisdiction,</v>

38
00:02:23.111 --> 00:02:23.944
<v Speaker 1>so we'll will allow the government to </v>
<v Speaker 1>force US Internet providers to block </v>

39
00:02:26.351 --> 00:02:28.490
<v Speaker 1>access to domain names that carry this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Con.</v>

40
00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:29.363
<v Speaker 1>Corporations can also sue under so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but any search engine that lists these </v>

41
00:02:31.871 --> 00:02:34.600
<v Speaker 1>sites and their result or any blog </v>
<v Speaker 1>reform that provides the Linkedin,</v>

42
00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:35.493
<v Speaker 1>but sofa has another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This log is corporations and the </v>

43
00:02:37.601 --> 00:02:38.434
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ability to choke the funding of </v>

44
00:02:39.731 --> 00:02:42.700
<v Speaker 1>websites by forcing advertisers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>payment services,</v>

45
00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.170
<v Speaker 1>pay pow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mastercard,</v>

46
00:02:44.171 --> 00:02:46.900
<v Speaker 1>visa from doing business with them from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time the claim is filed,</v>

47
00:02:46.901 --> 00:02:47.734
<v Speaker 1>the service would have five days to </v>
<v Speaker 1>separate the infringing website or risk </v>

48
00:02:50.741 --> 00:02:51.574
<v Speaker 1>persecution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think payment service </v>

49
00:02:52.631 --> 00:02:54.010
<v Speaker 1>providers will do given the choice?</v>

50
00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.730
<v Speaker 1>It's economic submission and Internet </v>
<v Speaker 1>death panel.</v>

51
00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:57.583
<v Speaker 1>Copyright Law is certainly in port </v>
<v Speaker 1>credit compensation should be provided </v>

52
00:03:00.431 --> 00:03:02.440
<v Speaker 1>to artists who sell their work under </v>
<v Speaker 1>copyright.</v>

53
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:03.603
<v Speaker 1>They deserve to be protect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem with sofas is that though </v>

54
00:03:05.081 --> 00:03:05.914
<v Speaker 1>protection isn't stated aim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the law won't be effective against </v>

55
00:03:08.351 --> 00:03:09.730
<v Speaker 1>content piracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example.</v>

56
00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:13.570
<v Speaker 1>He'll still be able to access block </v>
<v Speaker 1>sites by entering the Ip address instead</v>

57
00:03:13.571 --> 00:03:14.404
<v Speaker 1>of the domain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not all Sopa might actually </v>

58
00:03:16.391 --> 00:03:17.224
<v Speaker 1>work against its purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a thing you've never heard of </v>

59
00:03:18.971 --> 00:03:19.804
<v Speaker 1>called the domain name system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Security extensions or DNS SEC provides </v>

60
00:03:23.741 --> 00:03:27.520
<v Speaker 1>end to end encryption of domain name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Making sure that there's no break in the</v>

61
00:03:27.521 --> 00:03:30.640
<v Speaker 1>chain between say citizens bank and its </v>
<v Speaker 1>customer,</v>

62
00:03:30.641 --> 00:03:34.930
<v Speaker 1>forcing Internet providers to redirect </v>
<v Speaker 1>allegedly piratical sites to FBI servers</v>

63
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.050
<v Speaker 1>is incompatible with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most experts believe that tampering with</v>

64
00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:41.140
<v Speaker 1>the internets registry of domain names </v>
<v Speaker 1>will result in less security,</v>

65
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.380
<v Speaker 1>not more in fact is that hackers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>pirates have always had a way of binding</v>

66
00:03:44.381 --> 00:03:48.010
<v Speaker 1>cracks and circumventing laws despite </v>
<v Speaker 1>efforts to stop what many fear about so,</v>

67
00:03:48.011 --> 00:03:48.844
<v Speaker 1>but is its potential to curb and </v>
<v Speaker 1>discourage innovation in our most </v>

68
00:03:51.221 --> 00:03:52.170
<v Speaker 1>innovative industry.</v>

69
00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.013
<v Speaker 1>The digital marketplace of ideas that </v>
<v Speaker 1>welcomes every blog and tweet is the </v>

70
00:03:56.921 --> 00:03:57.754
<v Speaker 1>same one that inspires the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>generation of innovators to fuel our </v>

71
00:04:00.971 --> 00:04:03.040
<v Speaker 1>economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He will give corporations the ability to</v>

72
00:04:03.041 --> 00:04:03.874
<v Speaker 1>target startups,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new search engines or new social media </v>

73
00:04:06.011 --> 00:04:09.610
<v Speaker 1>platforms if they feel that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>filtering isn't good at one lawsuit to a</v>

74
00:04:09.611 --> 00:04:12.550
<v Speaker 1>small fledgling company is usually all </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it takes.</v>

75
00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.860
<v Speaker 1>Even established sites like Tumblr,</v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube,</v>

76
00:04:14.861 --> 00:04:16.700
<v Speaker 1>soundcloud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and facebook could come under the gun.</v>

77
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:17.553
<v Speaker 1>Any amount of illegal content could be </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to temporarily shut down the </v>

78
00:04:19.901 --> 00:04:23.030
<v Speaker 1>entire site and violators.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That little baby who likes big.</v>

79
00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:30.420
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or that guy who makes awesome acapella</v>

80
00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:46.490
<v Speaker 4>that these</v>

81
00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.630
<v Speaker 1>people could face jail time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't send babies to jail.</v>

82
00:04:55.631 --> 00:04:59.470
<v Speaker 1>Representative Lamar Smith from Texas </v>
<v Speaker 1>announced the legislation last month and</v>

83
00:04:59.471 --> 00:05:00.304
<v Speaker 1>it has bipartisan support.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also has bipartisan opposition on this </v>

84
00:05:03.161 --> 00:05:03.994
<v Speaker 1>issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nancy Pelosi and Ron Paul are on the </v>

85
00:05:05.861 --> 00:05:06.790
<v Speaker 1>same side.</v>

91
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.680
<v Speaker 1>stating that Sopa was a serious risk to </v>

<v Speaker 1>and it should be noted that the MPA,</v>

94
00:05:24.071 --> 00:05:26.800
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a relatively tiny workforce.</v>

95
00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.190
<v Speaker 1>When you compare it to the jobs created </v>
<v Speaker 1>by the inner.</v>

96
00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:30.063
<v Speaker 1>I put links to petitions and information</v>

<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

98
00:05:33.251 --> 00:05:36.010
<v Speaker 1>there's a provision in American </v>
<v Speaker 1>copyright law called fair.</v>

99
00:05:36.011 --> 00:05:39.700
<v Speaker 1>You get grants and exception to </v>
<v Speaker 1>copyrighted material for the purposes of</v>

100
00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:41.230
<v Speaker 1>commentary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>criticism,</v>

101
00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:42.940
<v Speaker 1>news reporting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>research.</v>

102
00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:46.540
<v Speaker 1>Here are the four factors used to </v>
<v Speaker 1>determine whether or not use is fair.</v>

103
00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:47.403
<v Speaker 1>The purpose and character of the use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including whether such use is of a </v>

104
00:05:49.451 --> 00:05:52.690
<v Speaker 1>commercial nature or is for nonprofit </v>
<v Speaker 1>educational purposes,</v>

105
00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:53.553
<v Speaker 1>the nature of the copyrighted work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the amount and substantial ability of </v>

106
00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:56.853
<v Speaker 1>the portion used in relation to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>copyrighted work as a whole and the </v>

107
00:05:59.391 --> 00:06:00.224
<v Speaker 1>effect or use upon the potential mark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what about my use of Robert De </v>

108
00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.330
<v Speaker 1>Niro's?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great comeback movie of 2009.</v>

109
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:07.400
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it fair?</v>

110
00:06:07.401 --> 00:06:08.810
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One purpose and character.</v>

111
00:06:08.811 --> 00:06:09.644
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm using the clip to make a point for </v>

112
00:06:11.391 --> 00:06:14.330
<v Speaker 1>completely nonprofit purpose to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature of the work.</v>

113
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.220
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a Hollywood movie.</v>

114
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:17.990
<v Speaker 1>It's gross.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sixty dollars million,</v>

115
00:06:17.991 --> 00:06:22.460
<v Speaker 1>$454,850.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's budget $20 million.</v>

116
00:06:22.461 --> 00:06:24.710
<v Speaker 1>So I'm helping still on DVD.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

117
00:06:24.711 --> 00:06:26.420
<v Speaker 1>Number three,</v>
