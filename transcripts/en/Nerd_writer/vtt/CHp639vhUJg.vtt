1
00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:02.303
<v Speaker 1>It's everything is ours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't have cell coverage is grounded </v>

2
00:00:10.741 --> 00:00:14.460
<v Speaker 1>into a double play that set this up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told him it was a family discussion.</v>

3
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you should sell it all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you.</v>

4
00:00:18.251 --> 00:00:21.900
<v Speaker 1>I expect you to get so upset about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am upset about it.</v>

5
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:24.813
<v Speaker 1>One thing I think film can do really </v>
<v Speaker 1>well better than any other medium is </v>

6
00:00:27.811 --> 00:00:30.960
<v Speaker 1>capture the reality of conversations in </v>
<v Speaker 1>a book.</v>

7
00:00:30.961 --> 00:00:31.794
<v Speaker 1>No matter how you lay it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one piece of dialogue always has to </v>

8
00:00:34.261 --> 00:00:35.094
<v Speaker 1>follow another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't simulate people talking over </v>

9
00:00:37.501 --> 00:00:38.334
<v Speaker 1>each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what we all do a lot of the </v>

10
00:00:40.111 --> 00:00:42.600
<v Speaker 1>time and you can't really capture the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rhythm,</v>

11
00:00:42.601 --> 00:00:43.434
<v Speaker 1>speed and tone that a conversation has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even radio and theater miss some of the </v>

12
00:00:47.281 --> 00:00:50.430
<v Speaker 1>nuances that film is perfectly suited to</v>
<v Speaker 1>reproduce.</v>

13
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.190
<v Speaker 1>Told us he was in the hospital this </v>
<v Speaker 1>morning via text.</v>

14
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.210
<v Speaker 1>They were saying we want to information </v>
<v Speaker 1>of all the filmmakers working right now.</v>

15
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:02.543
<v Speaker 1>I think Noah bombeck maybe has the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>ear for dialogue as it really is an an </v>

16
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:08.503
<v Speaker 1>eras what it takes because there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>general disconnect between what we all </v>

17
00:01:11.941 --> 00:01:15.120
<v Speaker 1>sound like and what movie and TV </v>
<v Speaker 1>character sound like,</v>

18
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:15.983
<v Speaker 1>especially the most articulate ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You asked me that question and then my </v>

19
00:01:19.291 --> 00:01:20.124
<v Speaker 1>world came apart and she came here and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>landed in the tabloids and I got death </v>

20
00:01:23.281 --> 00:01:27.570
<v Speaker 1>threats and my job is constantly in </v>
<v Speaker 1>jeopardy and you ruined my life again.</v>

21
00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.490
<v Speaker 1>Just that of course you don't have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>aim at realistic speech.</v>

22
00:01:32.491 --> 00:01:36.630
<v Speaker 1>Screenwriters like Aaron Sorkin and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Quintin Tarantino have done really great</v>

23
00:01:36.631 --> 00:01:39.780
<v Speaker 1>work by writing human dialogue as it </v>
<v Speaker 1>could be,</v>

24
00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.130
<v Speaker 1>finding music and language the same way </v>
<v Speaker 1>that Shakespeare did centuries ago,</v>

25
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.340
<v Speaker 1>but bomb back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>

26
00:01:46.341 --> 00:01:48.800
<v Speaker 1>it seems to be committed to a different </v>
<v Speaker 1>principal.</v>

27
00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:49.860
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I mentioned to you,</v>

28
00:01:49.861 --> 00:01:51.120
<v Speaker 1>I left the company.</v>

29
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.250
<v Speaker 1>I was with him in a couple of other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

30
00:01:53.251 --> 00:01:56.820
<v Speaker 1>started our own firm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was scary in a big change,</v>

31
00:01:56.821 --> 00:01:58.980
<v Speaker 1>but things have settled and we're doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>really well.</v>

32
00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.843
<v Speaker 1>Maureen is talking to a friend about </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting someone to come up and review </v>

33
00:02:03.511 --> 00:02:06.420
<v Speaker 1>the show for in recent years have </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially been ignored.</v>

34
00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.270
<v Speaker 1>Some of the back on the map is our logo </v>
<v Speaker 1>because $35 for a steak.</v>

35
00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.680
<v Speaker 1>I think a conversation like this speaks </v>
<v Speaker 1>volumes in one sense.</v>

36
00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.640
<v Speaker 1>Just by looking at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see that this is a total failure</v>

37
00:02:20.641 --> 00:02:24.630
<v Speaker 1>of communication between father and son.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The two men are on parallel tracks.</v>

38
00:02:24.631 --> 00:02:25.464
<v Speaker 1>Matt is talking about his new business </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Harold is talking about his </v>

39
00:02:28.531 --> 00:02:29.364
<v Speaker 1>forthcoming art retrospective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in another sense what makes this </v>

40
00:02:32.191 --> 00:02:34.500
<v Speaker 1>exchange so heartbreaking and true to </v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

41
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:35.363
<v Speaker 1>at least for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that they really are communicating </v>

42
00:02:37.561 --> 00:02:39.780
<v Speaker 1>with each other just not explicitly.</v>

43
00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.350
<v Speaker 1>Matt brings up a major life change and </v>
<v Speaker 1>expresses some of the hopes and fears he</v>

44
00:02:43.351 --> 00:02:46.020
<v Speaker 1>has about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and his father immediately brings up his</v>

45
00:02:46.021 --> 00:02:49.380
<v Speaker 1>own major life event and some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hopes and fears he has about that.</v>

46
00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.800
<v Speaker 1>Implicitly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Matt is asking for approval.</v>

47
00:02:52.801 --> 00:02:56.190
<v Speaker 1>He's asking for reassurance and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>asking for constellation.</v>

48
00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:57.600
<v Speaker 1>Harold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the other hand,</v>

49
00:02:57.601 --> 00:02:58.434
<v Speaker 1>is denying approval because he bear his </v>
<v Speaker 1>son being more successful than he is </v>

50
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:02.553
<v Speaker 1>while asking for reassurance of his own </v>
<v Speaker 1>hopes and constellation for his own </v>

51
00:03:06.221 --> 00:03:07.054
<v Speaker 1>fears and it's like the two men are </v>
<v Speaker 1>firing a volley of missiles at each </v>

52
00:03:09.821 --> 00:03:11.230
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some are hitting,</v>

53
00:03:11.231 --> 00:03:14.230
<v Speaker 1>some are missing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and some are crashing into each other in</v>

54
00:03:14.231 --> 00:03:15.064
<v Speaker 1>mid air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think bombeck understands a key </v>

55
00:03:17.201 --> 00:03:20.890
<v Speaker 1>dynamic in conversations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially conversations with family.</v>

56
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.113
<v Speaker 1>When we speak to others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're often speaking to ourselves </v>

57
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:25.743
<v Speaker 1>attempting to frame dialogue so that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>person we're talking to will reflect </v>

58
00:03:29.261 --> 00:03:32.230
<v Speaker 1>back the things that we want to believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>about us.</v>

59
00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.273
<v Speaker 1>When I was younger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was so invested in his grievances is </v>

60
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.740
<v Speaker 1>anger the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were mine too,</v>

61
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.150
<v Speaker 1>but now that I live 3000 miles away and </v>
<v Speaker 1>have my own kid thriving business,</v>

62
00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:46.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't even get angry at him anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's even just funny.</v>

63
00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:47.673
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure a lot of people who just went </v>
<v Speaker 1>home for Thanksgiving experienced </v>

64
00:03:50.101 --> 00:03:52.750
<v Speaker 1>something like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You feel that you've changed,</v>

65
00:03:52.751 --> 00:03:53.584
<v Speaker 1>that you have an updated nuanced idea of</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself and you're going to show that </v>

66
00:03:56.291 --> 00:03:58.460
<v Speaker 1>idea in one way or another to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>family</v>

67
00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:01.143
<v Speaker 2>how much money I make you make me feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a piece of shit because you don't </v>

68
00:04:04.781 --> 00:04:05.614
<v Speaker 2>care about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to also actually do really obsessed </v>

69
00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.710
<v Speaker 2>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know that I beat you.</v>

70
00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.750
<v Speaker 2>The thing</v>

71
00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:15.583
<v Speaker 1>we seem to forget is that as we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to get our family to affirm our </v>

72
00:04:18.501 --> 00:04:19.334
<v Speaker 1>sense of self are doing the same thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>to us and the result is often conflict </v>

73
00:04:23.931 --> 00:04:28.070
<v Speaker 1>or a conversation that just goes nowhere</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe not nowhere.</v>

74
00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.730
<v Speaker 1>Just not where you intended.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That says you started your own company.</v>

75
00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple of other guys and you just tell</v>

76
00:04:34.791 --> 00:04:35.624
<v Speaker 1>you boss like I want to start with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was one of the partners so I didn't </v>

77
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.250
<v Speaker 1>have a boss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>

78
00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.410
<v Speaker 1>So you got a better offer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

79
00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.360
<v Speaker 1>there were no offers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what was so scary.</v>

80
00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.540
<v Speaker 1>We were creating our own opportunity </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you wanted something smaller,</v>

81
00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.450
<v Speaker 1>bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is my favorite scene in the movie.</v>

82
00:04:50.451 --> 00:04:51.284
<v Speaker 1>It's a minute and 32nd long take of two </v>
<v Speaker 1>half brothers attempting to connect by </v>

83
00:04:55.521 --> 00:04:58.220
<v Speaker 1>making it one take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get all the elements of conversation</v>

84
00:04:58.221 --> 00:05:01.130
<v Speaker 1>that I spoke about before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including the body language,</v>

85
00:05:01.131 --> 00:05:03.920
<v Speaker 1>the projected self confidence of matt </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the nervous,</v>

86
00:05:03.921 --> 00:05:07.880
<v Speaker 1>insecure energy of Danny always nodding </v>
<v Speaker 1>his head like his father.</v>

87
00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.160
<v Speaker 1>They're doing this thing where they </v>
<v Speaker 1>agree.</v>

88
00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.113
<v Speaker 1>Well also disagreeing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a specific kind of non argument </v>

89
00:05:13.821 --> 00:05:17.120
<v Speaker 1>that tells you a lot about their </v>
<v Speaker 1>personalities and their relationship.</v>

90
00:05:17.121 --> 00:05:19.700
<v Speaker 1>Many of the firms clients came with us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was surprising.</v>

91
00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:21.200
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we expect it.</v>

92
00:05:21.201 --> 00:05:22.910
<v Speaker 1>We can't legally ask clients to come </v>
<v Speaker 1>with us.</v>

93
00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:26.300
<v Speaker 1>They don't have much choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's totally their choice.</v>

94
00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.220
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know because you have their money.</v>

95
00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:29.413
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so much going on here on one </v>

96
00:05:30.771 --> 00:05:31.604
<v Speaker 1>level of Danny is trying to connect with</v>
<v Speaker 1>matt by literally trying to finish his </v>

97
00:05:34.911 --> 00:05:35.744
<v Speaker 1>sentences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was also trying to challenge him and </v>

98
00:05:37.401 --> 00:05:40.460
<v Speaker 1>assert some dominance by acting like he </v>
<v Speaker 1>knows what Matt's going to say.</v>

99
00:05:40.461 --> 00:05:42.710
<v Speaker 1>Next,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about speaking to yourself.</v>

100
00:05:42.711 --> 00:05:47.310
<v Speaker 1>Danny is effectively trying to hijack </v>
<v Speaker 1>matt sentences and make them his own and</v>

101
00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:49.220
<v Speaker 1>listen for this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next time you're in a conversation,</v>

102
00:05:49.221 --> 00:05:50.780
<v Speaker 1>people do this all the time.</v>

103
00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:51.643
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their monies with the firm that their </v>

104
00:05:52.431 --> 00:05:57.040
<v Speaker 1>money is in investments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bought Ptolemy lives across the street</v>

105
00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.330
<v Speaker 1>and I lived across the street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dad told me about your.</v>

106
00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.230
<v Speaker 1>Karen is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can arbitrage.</v>

107
00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:06.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not what I do at this point,</v>

108
00:06:06.871 --> 00:06:10.440
<v Speaker 1>Matt and Danny or getting sick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which actually makes it appropriate that</v>

109
00:06:10.441 --> 00:06:11.274
<v Speaker 1>Danny brings up arbitrage and investment</v>
<v Speaker 1>term for when the same asset is worth </v>

110
00:06:14.971 --> 00:06:15.804
<v Speaker 1>different values in different places and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you exploit that price difference for </v>

111
00:06:19.201 --> 00:06:20.034
<v Speaker 1>profit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exploiting differences in value is a </v>

112
00:06:22.171 --> 00:06:23.004
<v Speaker 1>pretty good definition of what it's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be in a dysfunctional family or a </v>

113
00:06:26.041 --> 00:06:27.810
<v Speaker 1>dysfunctional conversation for them </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>

114
00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:28.703
<v Speaker 1>It's all him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said that the system is rigged from </v>

115
00:06:31.011 --> 00:06:33.830
<v Speaker 1>the inside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not entirely true.</v>

116
00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.500
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly so this is an exciting time.</v>

117
00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:38.620
<v Speaker 1>Boy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

118
00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.170
<v Speaker 1>Victoria and I are having some problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never met her.</v>

119
00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.880
<v Speaker 1>Karen and I separated.</v>

120
00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:46.010
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just said I was sorry.</v>

121
00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:48.970
<v Speaker 1>Did you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry to and there it is.</v>

122
00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:49.863
<v Speaker 1>A moment of connection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One Minute and 13 seconds into the </v>

123
00:06:52.301 --> 00:06:53.134
<v Speaker 1>conversation in the Meyerowitz family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>moments of connection are few and far </v>

124
00:06:55.901 --> 00:06:57.520
<v Speaker 1>between,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when they happen,</v>

125
00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:58.383
<v Speaker 1>they land with a special poignancy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>know this family has perhaps more </v>

126
00:07:01.811 --> 00:07:04.090
<v Speaker 1>intense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more insecure than most.</v>

127
00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:05.043
<v Speaker 1>I hope there's something that rings so </v>
<v Speaker 1>true about this to me when we talk so </v>

128
00:07:09.071 --> 00:07:11.230
<v Speaker 1>often,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we fly around each other,</v>

129
00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.780
<v Speaker 1>working at our own shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about ourselves.</v>

130
00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:18.280
<v Speaker 1>We try to make our meaning clear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we can't quite say what we want,</v>

131
00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:20.350
<v Speaker 1>how we want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we want.</v>

132
00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:21.653
<v Speaker 1>That's because communication isn't easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes movies make it seem like it </v>

133
00:07:26.351 --> 00:07:27.184
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Noah Baumbach isn't interested in </v>

134
00:07:29.231 --> 00:07:30.064
<v Speaker 1>that kind of dialogue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He uses the medium best suited for </v>

135
00:07:32.831 --> 00:07:35.740
<v Speaker 1>depicting conversations to show us the </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth about that,</v>

136
00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:40.960
<v Speaker 1>that we miss the mark more often than </v>
<v Speaker 1>hit it and that it's a beautiful,</v>

137
00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:45.060
<v Speaker 1>meaningful thing when we do what.</v>

138
00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:54.553
<v Speaker 1>One of the questions I get asked the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most by far is what kind of software do </v>

139
00:07:57.141 --> 00:07:57.974
<v Speaker 1>I use to make these videos to edit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I use final cut pro 10 and since 10 is </v>

140
00:08:01.581 --> 00:08:03.590
<v Speaker 1>so different from the programs that came</v>
<v Speaker 1>before it.</v>

141
00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:04.573
<v Speaker 1>I actually depended a lot on online </v>
<v Speaker 1>videos to teach me the new features and </v>

142
00:08:08.001 --> 00:08:08.834
<v Speaker 1>these days you can pretty much teach </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself anything this way and </v>
