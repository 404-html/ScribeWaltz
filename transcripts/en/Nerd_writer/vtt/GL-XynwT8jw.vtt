00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.280
<v Speaker 1>If you go to Vimeo.com</v>
<v Speaker 1>staff picks page,</v>

2
00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:14.383
<v Speaker 1>you'll find several short films that </v>
<v Speaker 1>play in the same meticulously designed </v>

3
00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.490
<v Speaker 1>weird art house thriller space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As Jonathan glazers under the skin.</v>

4
00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:25.693
<v Speaker 1>You see that kind of thing on the web </v>
<v Speaker 1>more than you do in the theater because </v>

5
00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.390
<v Speaker 1>supreme ambiguity as a cinematic </v>
<v Speaker 1>category rarely attracts investment.</v>

6
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.760
<v Speaker 1>The reason for this is contemptible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but obvious,</v>

7
00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.020
<v Speaker 1>the lack of explanation or closure is </v>
<v Speaker 1>painful.</v>

8
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.750
<v Speaker 1>It hurts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as m John Harrison says,</v>

9
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.700
<v Speaker 1>therapists and unwillingness to serve up</v>
<v Speaker 1>that failure to film goers,</v>

10
00:00:49.701 --> 00:00:50.534
<v Speaker 1>that pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that anxiety has ruled Hollywood from </v>

11
00:00:54.201 --> 00:00:55.034
<v Speaker 1>the start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So ideas like these find a home on the </v>

12
00:00:57.291 --> 00:00:59.990
<v Speaker 1>web which embraces everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Art,</v>

13
00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.400
<v Speaker 1>how shorts are potent because there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>brief 20 minutes at the very longest,</v>

14
00:01:04.401 --> 00:01:08.420
<v Speaker 1>happy to contain a single question to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>a single question.</v>

15
00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:09.523
<v Speaker 1>What makes under the skin so special is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it maintains the same potency </v>

16
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.070
<v Speaker 1>across 108 minutes.</v>

17
00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.090
<v Speaker 1>The movie follows scarlet Johansen as </v>
<v Speaker 1>Laura a blank face,</v>

18
00:01:20.091 --> 00:01:20.924
<v Speaker 1>but beautiful alien as she follows and </v>
<v Speaker 1>ensnares young men who are never to be </v>

19
00:01:25.521 --> 00:01:27.260
<v Speaker 1>seen or heard from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

20
00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.400
<v Speaker 1>watching listlessly at the beach as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple and their dog drowned in a strong</v>

21
00:01:31.401 --> 00:01:32.234
<v Speaker 1>undertow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's made clear that Laura does not </v>

22
00:01:34.041 --> 00:01:37.100
<v Speaker 1>possess a traditional set of morals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if any,</v>

23
00:01:37.101 --> 00:01:40.370
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A few compatriot aliens with speed bikes</v>

24
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.353
<v Speaker 1>act as a cleanup crew for her nocturnal </v>
<v Speaker 1>activities and make sure she keeps on </v>

25
00:01:45.381 --> 00:01:47.080
<v Speaker 1>schedule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plot wise,</v>

26
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.073
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty much it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The interactions between Laura and her </v>

27
00:01:50.241 --> 00:01:53.200
<v Speaker 1>victims are tense and gripping in </v>
<v Speaker 1>between.</v>

28
00:01:53.201 --> 00:01:58.201
<v Speaker 1>Glazer treats us to long carefully frame</v>
<v Speaker 1>takes of pedestrians at shopping centers</v>

29
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.030
<v Speaker 1>or Johansen's face filmmakers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hold on images so you can examine them.</v>

30
00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.180
<v Speaker 1>If you see this film in theaters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be sure to let your eyes wander.</v>

31
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.600
<v Speaker 1>I was struck by the depth of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Scottish landscapes,</v>

32
00:02:11.601 --> 00:02:16.220
<v Speaker 1>the camera always sure to have elements </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the for middle and background,</v>

33
00:02:16.221 --> 00:02:19.490
<v Speaker 1>more three dimensional than anything you</v>
<v Speaker 1>need glasses for,</v>

34
00:02:19.491 --> 00:02:22.710
<v Speaker 1>particularly when contrasted with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>surreptitious camera work,</v>

35
00:02:22.711 --> 00:02:23.544
<v Speaker 1>glazer use to capture real Scott's from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the window of Laura's nondescript white </v>

36
00:02:28.101 --> 00:02:32.320
<v Speaker 1>van pepper throughout his imagery of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>more surreal for variety,</v>

37
00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:33.523
<v Speaker 1>evoking Kubrick at times mostly in its </v>
<v Speaker 1>boldness and not as much as the trailer </v>

38
00:02:37.301 --> 00:02:42.301
<v Speaker 1>suggests strung together by the perfect </v>
<v Speaker 1>screening score of Nica Levitt.</v>

39
00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:44.323
<v Speaker 1>Then toward the end of the film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Laura's inhumanity begins to peel back </v>

40
00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.590
<v Speaker 1>just in time for humanity to show its </v>
<v Speaker 1>darkest side.</v>

41
00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.620
<v Speaker 1>We finally glimpse what's under the </v>
<v Speaker 1>skin,</v>

42
00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.010
<v Speaker 1>but as she or it an alien,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Michel novel on which under the skin</v>

43
00:03:00.671 --> 00:03:05.671
<v Speaker 1>is based says so even glaser who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>adaptation runs far afield of the source</v>

44
00:03:05.951 --> 00:03:06.784
<v Speaker 1>material has said explicitly that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Johansen's character is other worldly </v>

45
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.000
<v Speaker 1>taking the film as it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

46
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.013
<v Speaker 1>I'm not so sure there is no question </v>
<v Speaker 1>that Laura is alien and all that </v>

47
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.350
<v Speaker 1>adjective means unfamiliar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>disturbing,</v>

48
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:21.213
<v Speaker 1>distasteful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's impossible to parse or motivations </v>

49
00:03:23.561 --> 00:03:27.460
<v Speaker 1>except for in the broadest strokes here </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the novel goes into much,</v>

50
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.353
<v Speaker 1>much more detail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm wary to identify anything that </v>

51
00:03:31.331 --> 00:03:36.331
<v Speaker 1>the film itself doesn't choose to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe Laura is just the demonstration of</v>

52
00:03:37.361 --> 00:03:38.194
<v Speaker 1>a feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an embodiment of all in nature that is </v>

53
00:03:40.541 --> 00:03:41.374
<v Speaker 1>reminisce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but disinterested or just the idea of </v>

54
00:03:44.651 --> 00:03:49.330
<v Speaker 1>disinterest set loose in the locks and </v>
<v Speaker 1>undertows of human yearning.</v>

55
00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.780
<v Speaker 1>Even this I'm afraid is saying too much </v>
<v Speaker 1>art.</v>

56
00:03:52.781 --> 00:03:56.710
<v Speaker 1>House movies are unapologetic in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>use of cinemas.</v>

57
00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.330
<v Speaker 1>Unique toolbox as a medium of light and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sound of imagery.</v>

58
00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.460
<v Speaker 1>Film is an innately ambiguous language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Filmmakers like laser,</v>

59
00:04:06.461 --> 00:04:07.294
<v Speaker 1>no doubt express their vision in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>form because actual language wasn't up </v>

60
00:04:11.711 --> 00:04:12.544
<v Speaker 1>to their task.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why then should we try to bring movies </v>

61
00:04:15.011 --> 00:04:17.530
<v Speaker 1>like under the skin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to the page?</v>

62
00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.513
<v Speaker 1>It works so hard to transcend because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the alternative is paint that vast </v>

63
00:04:24.851 --> 00:04:25.684
<v Speaker 1>ambiguous space like a dark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>empty room where you can be ensnared by </v>

64
00:04:30.101 --> 00:04:33.730
<v Speaker 1>something evocative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ensnared and suddenly consumed.</v>

65
00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:35.530
<v Speaker 1>Never learning why.</v>
