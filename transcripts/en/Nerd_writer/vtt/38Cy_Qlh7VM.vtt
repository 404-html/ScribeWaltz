1
00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm putting together a team,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people with special abilities and see,</v>

2
00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:05.920
<v Speaker 1>I believe enemies are coming</v>

3
00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:07.213
<v Speaker 2>right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in are now that the justice league </v>

4
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.433
<v Speaker 2>trailer is out and it has jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a lot of talk about dcs course </v>

5
00:00:17.211 --> 00:00:18.044
<v Speaker 2>correction as if the overly grim tone of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Batman v Superman was the key to why </v>

6
00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.460
<v Speaker 2>wasn't that good of a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but from my point of view,</v>

7
00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:26.443
<v Speaker 2>Zack Snyder could make justice league </v>
<v Speaker 2>and out and out comedy and it still </v>

8
00:00:30.321 --> 00:00:34.200
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't fix what I see as a more </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental problem in his filmmaking.</v>

9
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.010
<v Speaker 2>Something that's really apparent in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Batman versus superman.</v>

10
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.070
<v Speaker 2>His preoccupation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his obsession with moments,</v>

11
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.280
<v Speaker 2>the expense of scenes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do I mean by this?</v>

12
00:00:44.281 --> 00:00:45.114
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me start by saying this movie </v>

13
00:00:46.411 --> 00:00:51.060
<v Speaker 2>moments are awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really great moment can be transcendent.</v>

14
00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.440
<v Speaker 2>They can leave deep lifelong visual </v>
<v Speaker 2>impressions on a film goer.</v>

15
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.080
<v Speaker 2>They can come to represent a whole new </v>
<v Speaker 2>category of feeling.</v>

16
00:00:58.081 --> 00:00:58.914
<v Speaker 2>That's why film geeks like me reference </v>
<v Speaker 2>them so much in conversation with </v>

17
00:01:02.851 --> 00:01:06.210
<v Speaker 2>friends when you were a film student,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least when I was a film student.</v>

18
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.223
<v Speaker 2>That's what makes things exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of the student films I directed </v>

19
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.980
<v Speaker 2>revolved around a few moments that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought were going to blow people away.</v>

20
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.290
<v Speaker 2>If I could just navigate the story </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

21
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.350
<v Speaker 2>that would be enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The moment would do all the work.</v>

22
00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.560
<v Speaker 2>Then I just navigate to the next one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For this reason,</v>

23
00:01:22.561 --> 00:01:26.700
<v Speaker 2>my student films weren't that good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Batman v Superman,</v>

24
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.700
<v Speaker 2>dawn of justice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think suffers from a similar problem.</v>

25
00:01:29.701 --> 00:01:32.610
<v Speaker 2>Zack Snyder is obviously obsessed with </v>
<v Speaker 2>moments.</v>

26
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:33.643
<v Speaker 2>The movie is chock full of that moments </v>
<v Speaker 2>when time is slowed down in the </v>

27
00:01:36.601 --> 00:01:37.434
<v Speaker 2>composition is just right moments when </v>
<v Speaker 2>the score swells in the film tries to </v>

28
00:01:40.951 --> 00:01:43.200
<v Speaker 2>broadcast a single message.</v>

29
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.870
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people talk about Snyder as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>great visual stylist will.</v>

30
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.883
<v Speaker 2>Of course he is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where all the focus goes toward </v>

31
00:01:52.381 --> 00:01:55.140
<v Speaker 2>crafting moments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They say his character,</v>

32
00:01:55.141 --> 00:01:55.974
<v Speaker 2>his lack motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course they do because all character </v>

33
00:01:58.891 --> 00:02:01.500
<v Speaker 2>motivations are subservient to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>films.</v>

34
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.393
<v Speaker 2>Own motivation to reach the next moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes sense then that Snyder puts </v>

35
00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.650
<v Speaker 2>extraordinary care into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Montage is twice in this film,</v>

36
00:02:10.651 --> 00:02:15.180
<v Speaker 2>the opening credits featuring Batman's </v>
<v Speaker 2>origin story and at the 44 minute mark,</v>

37
00:02:15.181 --> 00:02:17.910
<v Speaker 2>spotlighting superman's more impressive </v>
<v Speaker 2>heroics.</v>

38
00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.983
<v Speaker 2>We have slow motion moment montage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>plus there are something like 40 shots </v>

39
00:02:23.401 --> 00:02:27.990
<v Speaker 2>in these montages together and they all </v>
<v Speaker 2>aim to be iconic.</v>

40
00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.780
<v Speaker 2>I think of Snyder could make a whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>movie like this.</v>

41
00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.640
<v Speaker 2>He would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh wait,</v>

42
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.540
<v Speaker 2>he already did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

43
00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.880
<v Speaker 2>It's also why he favors dream sequences </v>
<v Speaker 2>and flashbacks.</v>

44
00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.630
<v Speaker 2>More excuses to show more moments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What that meant,</v>

45
00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.470
<v Speaker 2>superman really lacks is scenes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actual scenes,</v>

46
00:02:50.471 --> 00:02:51.304
<v Speaker 2>not just filler between moments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scenes are hard to define since they're </v>

47
00:02:54.761 --> 00:02:57.400
<v Speaker 2>so malleable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to say what one is,</v>

48
00:02:57.401 --> 00:02:58.234
<v Speaker 2>but what a good scene does is dissolve </v>
<v Speaker 2>the actors and the soundstage and the </v>

49
00:03:02.531 --> 00:03:07.060
<v Speaker 2>costumes and makeup and camera angle </v>
<v Speaker 2>into a living and breathing reality.</v>

50
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.090
<v Speaker 2>We should be a strong sense of place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of feeling,</v>

51
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.953
<v Speaker 2>of possibility that the characters who </v>
<v Speaker 2>inhabit the space could go anywhere </v>

52
00:03:14.231 --> 00:03:15.700
<v Speaker 2>within it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if they don't.</v>

53
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:16.623
<v Speaker 2>Even if you know that the technicalities</v>
<v Speaker 2>of lighting and blocking wouldn't let </v>

54
00:03:19.721 --> 00:03:21.100
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

55
00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.993
<v Speaker 2>the discreet elements that make up a </v>
<v Speaker 2>good scene should not feel like they're </v>

56
00:03:24.911 --> 00:03:29.500
<v Speaker 2>in service to something else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even though they are too often in Batman</v>

57
00:03:29.501 --> 00:03:30.334
<v Speaker 2>v Superman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the characters feel awkwardly placed in </v>

58
00:03:32.771 --> 00:03:33.604
<v Speaker 2>their scenes.</v>

59
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:34.593
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does anyone get the sense that Clark </v>

60
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:37.323
<v Speaker 2>Kent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lois Lane or Perry white actually spend </v>

61
00:03:38.921 --> 00:03:42.820
<v Speaker 2>time as a daily planet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We visit the daily planet eight times in</v>

62
00:03:42.821 --> 00:03:43.654
<v Speaker 2>the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the longest scene there is only a </v>

63
00:03:44.771 --> 00:03:48.670
<v Speaker 2>minute and 11 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The rest are under a minute and half are</v>

64
00:03:48.671 --> 00:03:51.190
<v Speaker 2>under 30 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This doesn't feel like a place.</v>

65
00:03:51.191 --> 00:03:55.840
<v Speaker 2>It feels like a fraction of a location </v>
<v Speaker 2>where people say things like this.</v>

66
00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.330
<v Speaker 2>When the planet was founded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it stood for something period.</v>

67
00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.510
<v Speaker 2>The Bat Cave and Clark's apartment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lex Luthor is office.</v>

68
00:04:01.511 --> 00:04:02.344
<v Speaker 2>The kryptonians ship all have the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>issue and that's just about the extent </v>

69
00:04:05.231 --> 00:04:07.810
<v Speaker 2>of the settings that we visit more than </v>
<v Speaker 2>once in the film.</v>

70
00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.630
<v Speaker 2>What's more of these scenes are filmed </v>
<v Speaker 2>largely in medium shots,</v>

71
00:04:10.631 --> 00:04:14.350
<v Speaker 2>closeups or extreme closeups,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which makes it even harder to ground the</v>

72
00:04:14.351 --> 00:04:17.110
<v Speaker 2>scenes or for the audience to ground </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself within them.</v>

73
00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.430
<v Speaker 2>When in all these places,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we spend an awful lot of time looking at</v>

74
00:04:21.431 --> 00:04:22.264
<v Speaker 2>screens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's also very little distinction </v>

75
00:04:24.281 --> 00:04:25.114
<v Speaker 2>between metropolis and Gotham,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the two cities that sculpted their </v>

76
00:04:27.761 --> 00:04:30.730
<v Speaker 2>respective heroes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're looking for a metaphor for the</v>

77
00:04:30.731 --> 00:04:31.750
<v Speaker 2>whole film,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Note,</v>

78
00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:32.583
<v Speaker 2>the fact that one of the longest scenes </v>
<v Speaker 2>takes place on an abandoned island </v>

79
00:04:35.621 --> 00:04:39.190
<v Speaker 2>between the two cities that the heroes </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely destroyed.</v>

80
00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.190
<v Speaker 2>Building a good scene isn't only about </v>
<v Speaker 2>location,</v>

81
00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.053
<v Speaker 2>it's about fitting the dialogue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the tone and the characters into that </v>

82
00:04:46.211 --> 00:04:49.420
<v Speaker 2>location and endowing it with a sense of</v>
<v Speaker 2>duration.</v>

83
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.740
<v Speaker 2>Avengers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>age of ultron,</v>

84
00:04:50.741 --> 00:04:52.630
<v Speaker 2>from last year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It isn't a perfect movie,</v>

85
00:04:52.631 --> 00:04:57.130
<v Speaker 2>but there's a great story about how just</v>
<v Speaker 2>and fought to keep the Hawkeye farmhouse</v>

86
00:04:57.131 --> 00:05:00.320
<v Speaker 2>scene in the film that slow paced,</v>
<v Speaker 2>confident,</v>

87
00:05:00.321 --> 00:05:05.200
<v Speaker 2>seen runs for a full 16 minutes right in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the middle of the action and when you're</v>

88
00:05:05.201 --> 00:05:07.840
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not waiting to go somewhere else.</v>

89
00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:08.703
<v Speaker 2>You're there learning about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>characters and when those characters </v>

90
00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:15.700
<v Speaker 2>have their moments later in the film,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they land with poignancy.</v>

91
00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:17.830
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost all films,</v>

92
00:05:17.831 --> 00:05:18.664
<v Speaker 2>especially Superhero blockbusters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are going to have expositional scenes </v>

93
00:05:21.431 --> 00:05:24.760
<v Speaker 2>and scenes that set up future action and</v>
<v Speaker 2>in great movies,</v>

94
00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:25.713
<v Speaker 2>all the scenes often work together to </v>
<v Speaker 2>participate in an overarching tone or a </v>

95
00:05:28.841 --> 00:05:29.674
<v Speaker 2>complex message.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But great scenes function as their own </v>

96
00:05:33.161 --> 00:05:38.161
<v Speaker 2>little universes within a film and good </v>
<v Speaker 2>movies should have plenty of them.</v>

97
00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:39.663
<v Speaker 2>That meant be superman runs for two and </v>
<v Speaker 2>a half hours with a heaping helping of </v>

98
00:05:43.061 --> 00:05:43.894
<v Speaker 2>big moments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and yet I don't quite feel like I've </v>

99
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.943
<v Speaker 2>been anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The scene is where all is loaded into </v>

100
00:05:51.551 --> 00:05:52.384
<v Speaker 2>the chamber.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Firing the gun without loading can only </v>

101
00:05:54.461 --> 00:05:56.860
<v Speaker 2>result in empty noise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bang,</v>

102
00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.853
<v Speaker 2>but no impact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm always hopeful about new superman </v>

103
00:06:00.921 --> 00:06:03.620
<v Speaker 2>movies because superman is so important </v>
<v Speaker 2>to me,</v>

104
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:07.160
<v Speaker 2>but I won't let some Batman Jokes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>upbeat rock music.</v>

105
00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:08.053
<v Speaker 2>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>light heartedness isn't the basic </v>

106
00:06:10.071 --> 00:06:15.071
<v Speaker 2>problem that needs to be fixed here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The overused and unearned moment is DC's</v>

107
00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:17.113
<v Speaker 2>greatest foe.</v>

108
00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:21.560
<v Speaker 2>Hey guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know I.</v>

109
00:06:21.561 --> 00:06:23.590
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't resist doing a video on </v>
<v Speaker 2>superman.</v>

110
00:06:23.591 --> 00:06:24.424
<v Speaker 2>I just can't resist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a new nerdwriter video every </v>
