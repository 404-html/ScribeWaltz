1
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.440
<v Speaker 1>As we sink deeper into the fever tree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is this unusually divisive and fear</v>

2
00:00:18.441 --> 00:00:19.274
<v Speaker 1>filled season,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's nice to have an anecdotal feeling </v>

3
00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:22.603
<v Speaker 1>in the form of winter holidays </v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout which despite being co opted </v>

4
00:00:26.091 --> 00:00:27.740
<v Speaker 1>by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hallmark commercialism,</v>

5
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.730
<v Speaker 1>a sense of family and of coming together</v>
<v Speaker 1>predominates.</v>

6
00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.890
<v Speaker 1>My favorite ritual of this time of year </v>
<v Speaker 1>is the annual broadcast,</v>

7
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.180
<v Speaker 1>a frank capra's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a wonderful life.</v>

8
00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:39.163
<v Speaker 1>On Christmas Eve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was once a postwar box office flop </v>

9
00:00:42.141 --> 00:00:46.160
<v Speaker 1>has become a cultural phenomenon </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognized as one of the great cinematic</v>

10
00:00:46.161 --> 00:00:50.000
<v Speaker 1>masterpieces by one of our very best </v>
<v Speaker 1>directors watching it.</v>

11
00:00:50.001 --> 00:00:50.834
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's tempting to brush off this film is </v>

12
00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.250
<v Speaker 1>overly sentimental and nostalgic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which it is,</v>

13
00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.880
<v Speaker 1>but I think we judge it like this at our</v>
<v Speaker 1>own peril indeed,</v>

14
00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.923
<v Speaker 1>with it's a wonderful life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Capra interrogate some of the key </v>

15
00:01:01.911 --> 00:01:02.744
<v Speaker 1>contradictions at the heart of American </v>
<v Speaker 1>life to see whether or not they can be </v>

16
00:01:05.991 --> 00:01:09.590
<v Speaker 1>reconciled or if in fact they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>exist at all.</v>

17
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.200
<v Speaker 1>Contradictions between the individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the community,</v>

18
00:01:12.201 --> 00:01:17.201
<v Speaker 1>between adventure and domesticity and </v>
<v Speaker 1>between success and an ordinary life.</v>

19
00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.470
<v Speaker 1>He stages these contradictions in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure of George Bailey,</v>

20
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.333
<v Speaker 1>the citizen of the small town of Bedford</v>
<v Speaker 1>falls and the president of the local </v>

21
00:01:25.431 --> 00:01:26.264
<v Speaker 1>building and loan is the film begins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know exactly what has happened </v>

22
00:01:29.781 --> 00:01:30.614
<v Speaker 1>to George,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only that he's in serious trouble and </v>

23
00:01:32.301 --> 00:01:33.134
<v Speaker 1>has reached the end of his rope and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's about to be $80 by divine </v>

24
00:01:35.891 --> 00:01:39.820
<v Speaker 1>intervention in the form of a guardian </v>
<v Speaker 1>angel seeking to earn his wings.</v>

25
00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.380
<v Speaker 1>We learned about George's life as his </v>
<v Speaker 1>angel does in a series of flashbacks.</v>

26
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.810
<v Speaker 2>Man wants to know something about him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>though</v>

27
00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.310
<v Speaker 1>George we learn has big dreams of </v>
<v Speaker 1>leaving Bedford falls,</v>

28
00:01:51.311 --> 00:01:54.460
<v Speaker 1>traveling the world and becoming a </v>
<v Speaker 1>metropolitan archetypes,</v>

29
00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.313
<v Speaker 1>shaking the dust of this crummy little </v>
<v Speaker 1>town off my feet and I'm going to see </v>

30
00:01:57.911 --> 00:01:59.770
<v Speaker 1>the oral,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but his selflessness,</v>

31
00:01:59.771 --> 00:02:00.604
<v Speaker 1>his drive to do the right thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>repeatedly comes in the way of these </v>

32
00:02:03.761 --> 00:02:06.370
<v Speaker 1>streams and you also learn about Bedford</v>
<v Speaker 1>falls,</v>

33
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.060
<v Speaker 1>a close knit community of mostly good </v>
<v Speaker 1>people leading simple lives,</v>

34
00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.923
<v Speaker 1>which is under the constant threat of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being taken over by a ruthless </v>

35
00:02:14.021 --> 00:02:17.800
<v Speaker 1>businessman called Mr Potter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only thing standing in potters way,</v>

36
00:02:17.801 --> 00:02:19.780
<v Speaker 1>his George Bailey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his father,</v>

37
00:02:19.781 --> 00:02:22.150
<v Speaker 1>and they're empathetic building and loan</v>
<v Speaker 1>operation,</v>

38
00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:23.673
<v Speaker 1>the foil to potter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the clear representation of corruption </v>

39
00:02:25.781 --> 00:02:28.390
<v Speaker 1>and evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the film is not George himself,</v>

40
00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.300
<v Speaker 1>but Mary Hatch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>George's eventual wife,</v>

41
00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.410
<v Speaker 1>a compassionate young woman who is quite</v>
<v Speaker 1>happy to stay and live in Bedford falls.</v>

42
00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:36.633
<v Speaker 1>It's important to note that both Potter </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Mary show up in every flashback </v>

43
00:02:39.821 --> 00:02:40.654
<v Speaker 1>representing George's desires for fame </v>
<v Speaker 1>and fortune on the one hand and his </v>

44
00:02:43.361 --> 00:02:45.700
<v Speaker 1>drive to do the right thing for his </v>
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>

45
00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.110
<v Speaker 1>On the other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

46
00:02:47.111 --> 00:02:49.120
<v Speaker 1>it's Mary's side that eventually wins </v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

47
00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:50.283
<v Speaker 1>but for the large majority of the film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>George is not rewarded for doing the </v>

48
00:02:54.131 --> 00:02:54.964
<v Speaker 1>right thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's punished when young George rescues </v>

49
00:02:57.641 --> 00:02:58.474
<v Speaker 1>his brother from a freezing lake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He loses the hearing in his left ear </v>

50
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.270
<v Speaker 1>when you weren't his boss about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>potentially disastrous accident.</v>

51
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.253
<v Speaker 1>He gets beaten when his father dies and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he takes on his responsibilities at the </v>

52
00:03:08.111 --> 00:03:08.944
<v Speaker 1>building and loan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He loses his chance for travel and </v>

53
00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:13.840
<v Speaker 1>college when there's a run on the bank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he misses his own honeymoon.</v>

54
00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:15.123
<v Speaker 1>Every noble sacrifice for Bedford falls </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes Bedford falls feel more like a </v>

55
00:03:19.961 --> 00:03:20.794
<v Speaker 1>trap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and instead of bringing him closer to </v>

56
00:03:22.091 --> 00:03:24.640
<v Speaker 1>the community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's helping capra shows him,</v>

57
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:25.653
<v Speaker 1>isolated from it in this shot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after realizing that his dreams of </v>

58
00:03:28.151 --> 00:03:28.984
<v Speaker 1>travel are finally squashed for good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>George stands isolated against a train </v>

59
00:03:33.191 --> 00:03:36.820
<v Speaker 1>that he'll never get on before he walked</v>
<v Speaker 1>slowly back into the crowd,</v>

60
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.520
<v Speaker 1>putting a smile on again like he always </v>
<v Speaker 1>does.</v>

61
00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:40.743
<v Speaker 1>Despite this parade of personal wounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>George's able to remain resilient until </v>

62
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.700
<v Speaker 1>the very end when his scatterbrained </v>
<v Speaker 1>uncle misplaces $8,000</v>

63
00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.700
<v Speaker 1>and puts them in danger of going to jail</v>
<v Speaker 1>for fraud,</v>

64
00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.893
<v Speaker 1>things get worse and worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and George believing himself worth more </v>

65
00:03:55.391 --> 00:03:57.970
<v Speaker 1>dead than alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Contemplate suicide.</v>

66
00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:59.343
<v Speaker 1>It's at this point that his guardian </v>
<v Speaker 1>Angel Clarence intervenes clearance odd </v>

67
00:04:04.871 --> 00:04:05.704
<v Speaker 1>body angel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>second class shows George what Bedford </v>

68
00:04:07.661 --> 00:04:10.420
<v Speaker 1>falls would have been like had he never </v>
<v Speaker 1>existed.</v>

69
00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:11.673
<v Speaker 1>What George sees is a nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bedford falls is now Pottersville and </v>

70
00:04:15.641 --> 00:04:16.474
<v Speaker 1>all the dreams he had have an exciting </v>
<v Speaker 1>life of adventure and exoticism have </v>

71
00:04:20.351 --> 00:04:21.184
<v Speaker 1>returned as perverted versions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves on the main drag of his </v>

72
00:04:24.341 --> 00:04:25.900
<v Speaker 1>former home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The moon,</v>

73
00:04:25.901 --> 00:04:26.734
<v Speaker 1>that George Promise to Lasso for Mary </v>
<v Speaker 1>that she had made into a lovely </v>

74
00:04:29.741 --> 00:04:34.690
<v Speaker 1>needlepoint picture is made ugly and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sleazy in the form of the blue moon cafe</v>

75
00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:35.613
<v Speaker 1>Martinis Bar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a place where any break from decent </v>

76
00:04:37.391 --> 00:04:38.224
<v Speaker 1>behavior was not tolerated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As become a garish speakeasy where </v>

77
00:04:41.141 --> 00:04:44.830
<v Speaker 1>anything goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything is turned into an opportunity</v>

78
00:04:44.831 --> 00:04:45.664
<v Speaker 1>for crass commercialism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even Georgia's home has become a </v>

79
00:04:48.611 --> 00:04:49.444
<v Speaker 1>boarding house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When George finally gets his old life </v>

80
00:04:52.211 --> 00:04:53.044
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's rewarded with generosity from the </v>

81
00:04:55.121 --> 00:04:55.954
<v Speaker 1>community who bail him out in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably touching finale that ends </v>

82
00:04:59.951 --> 00:05:00.784
<v Speaker 1>with everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including the cops who came to arrest </v>

83
00:05:02.261 --> 00:05:04.390
<v Speaker 1>him singing all plant science.</v>

84
00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.770
<v Speaker 1>It's easy to get carried away in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>wave of feeling,</v>

85
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.640
<v Speaker 1>but it's important to remember what </v>
<v Speaker 1>hasn't changed,</v>

86
00:05:21.641 --> 00:05:22.474
<v Speaker 1>and that's basically everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>George Bailey still has to live in his </v>

87
00:05:26.381 --> 00:05:27.214
<v Speaker 1>drafty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>old house scraping by to support his </v>

88
00:05:28.811 --> 00:05:29.830
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His business,</v>

89
00:05:29.831 --> 00:05:30.664
<v Speaker 1>despite being bailed out by the town,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remains at the brink of being swallowed </v>

90
00:05:33.701 --> 00:05:34.534
<v Speaker 1>by potters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>relentless expansion and the pot our </v>

91
00:05:36.671 --> 00:05:39.220
<v Speaker 1>faces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No consequences at all despite being the</v>

92
00:05:39.221 --> 00:05:40.054
<v Speaker 1>main protagonist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Despite stealing money from George </v>

93
00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.570
<v Speaker 1>Bailey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not vanquished.</v>

94
00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.080
<v Speaker 1>He's up $8,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense.</v>

95
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.200
<v Speaker 1>CAPRA reconciles the contradictions I </v>
<v Speaker 1>mentioned before,</v>

96
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:51.063
<v Speaker 1>success is not mutually exclusive to an </v>
<v Speaker 1>ordinary life adventure can be found in </v>

97
00:05:55.511 --> 00:05:56.344
<v Speaker 1>a domestic setting and yet the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>basic contradiction that between the </v>

98
00:05:59.991 --> 00:06:03.090
<v Speaker 1>individual and the community is left </v>
<v Speaker 1>open ended.</v>

99
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.370
<v Speaker 1>America has struggled with this </v>
<v Speaker 1>contradiction since before its founding.</v>

100
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:12.490
<v Speaker 1>How does a culture predicated on </v>
<v Speaker 1>individualism maintain public virtue?</v>

101
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:14.323
<v Speaker 1>How does an economic system that </v>
<v Speaker 1>incentivizes individual success keep </v>

102
00:06:16.941 --> 00:06:18.830
<v Speaker 1>from exploiting communities?</v>

103
00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:20.353
<v Speaker 1>If you have the answer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell us because we're still at the eve </v>

104
00:06:22.761 --> 00:06:27.761
<v Speaker 1>of 2016 struggling to figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel George's dilemma,</v>

105
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:28.753
<v Speaker 1>as I'm sure many of you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world shines with the promise of </v>

106
00:06:31.461 --> 00:06:34.340
<v Speaker 1>adventure and possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All that could be gained.</v>

107
00:06:34.341 --> 00:06:37.820
<v Speaker 1>Experience learned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If only you were to commit yourself to a</v>

108
00:06:37.821 --> 00:06:38.654
<v Speaker 1>radical individualism and yet the </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibilities of family and of the </v>

109
00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:44.270
<v Speaker 1>Community Nag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They call us back.</v>

110
00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:48.020
<v Speaker 1>They ask us to sacrifice and solution to</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

111
00:06:48.021 --> 00:06:48.854
<v Speaker 1>Everyone finds their own balance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you should keep in mind that it's </v>

112
00:06:51.651 --> 00:06:52.484
<v Speaker 1>these personal dilemmas played out in </v>
<v Speaker 1>society at large that ultimately draw </v>

113
00:06:56.571 --> 00:06:57.404
<v Speaker 1>the fault lines in our politics and </v>
<v Speaker 1>frank capra and George Bailey's time </v>

114
00:07:01.401 --> 00:07:02.234
<v Speaker 1>following World War II,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of an American destiny of the </v>

115
00:07:05.181 --> 00:07:08.570
<v Speaker 1>American way still had weight and </v>
<v Speaker 1>consensus.</v>

116
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:10.003
<v Speaker 1>A string of disasters have weakened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our resolve in such a thing have </v>

117
00:07:12.651 --> 00:07:13.484
<v Speaker 1>fractured our ability to imagine a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consensus and into the void rushes the </v>

118
00:07:18.171 --> 00:07:19.820
<v Speaker 1>heirs to Henry Potter.</v>

119
00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:22.340
<v Speaker 1>This is why the message of it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>wonderful life.</v>

120
00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:27.370
<v Speaker 1>A message of hope and perspective is not</v>
<v Speaker 1>so shallow as it seems.</v>

121
00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.130
<v Speaker 1>The contradictions in the film are never</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite resolved.</v>

122
00:07:31.131 --> 00:07:35.300
<v Speaker 1>Something beautifully dramatized by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>finial on Georgia stairs.</v>

123
00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:39.320
<v Speaker 1>There will always be an incompleteness </v>
<v Speaker 1>to life,</v>

124
00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:40.873
<v Speaker 1>but hope is not naive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hardiness and resolve against a </v>

125
00:07:44.901 --> 00:07:48.680
<v Speaker 1>situation that cannot give us assurances</v>
<v Speaker 1>or guarantees.</v>

126
00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:50.143
<v Speaker 1>The film shows us that a change of heart</v>
<v Speaker 1>and perspective far from being </v>

127
00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:53.803
<v Speaker 1>powerless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nostalgia and the face of an unusually </v>

128
00:07:56.151 --> 00:08:01.151
<v Speaker 1>divisive and fear filled season can be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>genuinely revolutionary.</v>

129
00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:11.410
<v Speaker 3>Hey everybody.</v>

<v Speaker 3>So everything you do is much,</v>

<v Speaker 3>This is one of my favorite movies of all</v>

141
00:08:35.841 --> 00:08:36.674
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jimmy Stewart is my favorite actor of </v>

142
00:08:38.121 --> 00:08:41.380
<v Speaker 3>all time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone once said that George Bailey was</v>

143
00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:45.350
<v Speaker 3>like a vessel that Jimmy Stewart poured </v>
<v Speaker 3>every nuance of as being into an.</v>

144
00:08:45.351 --> 00:08:47.750
<v Speaker 3>I totally agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love this movie.</v>

145
00:08:47.751 --> 00:08:49.700
<v Speaker 3>I'll never get tired of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I watch it every year.</v>

146
00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:52.180

<v Speaker 3>see you guys next Wednesday.</v>
