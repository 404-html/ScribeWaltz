1
00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.960
<v Speaker 1>So I was reading a fascinating asked </v>
<v Speaker 1>science on Reddit the other day.</v>

2
00:00:05.961 --> 00:00:10.850
<v Speaker 1>Someone wanted to know what was </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening in their mind when five apples</v>

3
00:00:10.851 --> 00:00:11.684
<v Speaker 1>were dropped on the floor and they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>asked to count them where they just </v>

4
00:00:14.331 --> 00:00:18.350
<v Speaker 1>counting quickly or did they remember </v>
<v Speaker 1>what five things look like in response?</v>

5
00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:19.213
<v Speaker 1>Reddit user surf,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kate tindle gave a great concise </v>

6
00:00:22.221 --> 00:00:26.870
<v Speaker 1>explanation of the difference between </v>
<v Speaker 1>counting and something called subitize.</v>

7
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:27.743
<v Speaker 1>Coming from the Latin subcutis meaning </v>
<v Speaker 1>sudden subitizing refers to our brain's </v>

8
00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.440
<v Speaker 1>ability to suddenly recognize objects up</v>
<v Speaker 1>to about four,</v>

9
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.360
<v Speaker 1>which means that if you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

10
00:00:38.361 --> 00:00:39.171
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

11
00:00:39.171 --> 00:00:41.390
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or four pizza johns,</v>

12
00:00:41.391 --> 00:00:45.230
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to spend any time looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>at each individual pizza.</v>

13
00:00:45.231 --> 00:00:46.064
<v Speaker 1>John,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just know how many pizza johns </v>

14
00:00:48.111 --> 00:00:48.944
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you increase that number by even </v>

15
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:51.523
<v Speaker 1>a little more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your mind loses the ability to grasp </v>

16
00:00:54.261 --> 00:00:55.670
<v Speaker 1>what it's looking at right away.</v>

17
00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:56.783
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time it takes to make a judgment on </v>

18
00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.913
<v Speaker 1>number's larger than four increases by </v>
<v Speaker 1>about 250 to 350 milliseconds with each </v>

19
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:06.583
<v Speaker 1>consecutive number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's because when you move out of the </v>

20
00:01:08.631 --> 00:01:09.464
<v Speaker 1>subitizing range,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you actually have to look at each </v>

21
00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.460
<v Speaker 1>individual item and count them up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way we do this is by taking the list</v>

22
00:01:16.461 --> 00:01:17.480
<v Speaker 1>of numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

23
00:01:17.481 --> 00:01:17.871
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

24
00:01:17.871 --> 00:01:18.321
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>

25
00:01:18.321 --> 00:01:18.771
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven,</v>

26
00:01:18.771 --> 00:01:19.191
<v Speaker 1>eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine,</v>

27
00:01:19.191 --> 00:01:20.330
<v Speaker 1>10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so on,</v>

28
00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.810
<v Speaker 1>and assigning them to the pizza johns in</v>
<v Speaker 1>ascending order.</v>

29
00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:24.763
<v Speaker 1>When we reached the end of our set,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever number we stopped on is the </v>

30
00:01:27.591 --> 00:01:30.440
<v Speaker 1>number of items there are digging a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little deeper.</v>

31
00:01:30.441 --> 00:01:35.441
<v Speaker 1>This process of counting as we know it </v>
<v Speaker 1>involves five criteria that was a little</v>

32
00:01:36.021 --> 00:01:37.250
<v Speaker 1>bit corny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>

33
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.113
<v Speaker 1>the one to one principal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning that each object can only have </v>

34
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.310
<v Speaker 1>one tag or number name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>second or Dunalley meeting,</v>

35
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.960
<v Speaker 1>that the tags must be applied in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same order every time.</v>

36
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.531
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

37
00:01:48.531 --> 00:01:49.340
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>

38
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.600
<v Speaker 1>not three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

39
00:01:50.601 --> 00:01:51.500
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>

40
00:01:51.501 --> 00:01:52.340
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight,</v>

41
00:01:52.341 --> 00:01:54.710
<v Speaker 1>nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Omega Jackson pollock,</v>

42
00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.170
<v Speaker 1>third,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cardinal principle or cardinality,</v>

43
00:01:57.171 --> 00:01:58.004
<v Speaker 1>which I mentioned before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning that the last tag always </v>

44
00:02:00.591 --> 00:02:05.080
<v Speaker 1>represents the absolute quantity of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>set forth the order irrelevance,</v>

45
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.210
<v Speaker 1>which means that it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's irrelevant which order,</v>

46
00:02:08.211 --> 00:02:11.210
<v Speaker 1>the objects are counted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The number will always be the same.</v>

47
00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.730
<v Speaker 1>And finally fifth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the abstraction principle,</v>

48
00:02:13.731 --> 00:02:17.690
<v Speaker 1>or the ability to apply counting to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>number of varied objects,</v>

49
00:02:17.691 --> 00:02:20.510
<v Speaker 1>not just the same one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>used multiple times,</v>

50
00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.080
<v Speaker 1>counting in this way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extrapolated allows us to deal with very</v>

51
00:02:24.081 --> 00:02:28.160
<v Speaker 1>large numbers aided by something which </v>
<v Speaker 1>is not innate to our minds,</v>

52
00:02:28.161 --> 00:02:33.140
<v Speaker 1>but is an artificial symbolic system </v>
<v Speaker 1>which we've memorized to the point where</v>

53
00:02:33.141 --> 00:02:33.974
<v Speaker 1>it feels a we know of a few cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact like the Amazonian Indigenous </v>

54
00:02:37.611 --> 00:02:41.120
<v Speaker 1>Group Moon Rico,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who don't have words for number's larger</v>

55
00:02:41.121 --> 00:02:43.210
<v Speaker 1>than five or the Brazilian peter hot.</v>

56
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.053
<v Speaker 1>People who only have names for one and </v>
<v Speaker 1>two above that they just say many when </v>

57
00:02:48.531 --> 00:02:49.364
<v Speaker 1>tested both the moon to Roku and Pitta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People were able to subitize small </v>

58
00:02:52.791 --> 00:02:53.624
<v Speaker 1>numbers and approximate large numbers </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the same relative accuracy as </v>

59
00:02:57.261 --> 00:02:58.094
<v Speaker 1>Westerners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they could not gauge the exact </v>

60
00:03:00.521 --> 00:03:05.230
<v Speaker 1>amount of many items without the aid of </v>
<v Speaker 1>precise number names,</v>

61
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.250
<v Speaker 1>subitizing and counting our incredible </v>
<v Speaker 1>capabilities of the human brain,</v>

62
00:03:09.251 --> 00:03:10.084
<v Speaker 1>which we take for granted every day to </v>
<v Speaker 1>appreciate just how fast your brain </v>

63
00:03:14.231 --> 00:03:15.670
<v Speaker 1>works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll leave you with this.</v>

64
00:03:15.671 --> 00:03:20.620
<v Speaker 1>Get your pause buttons ready and pause </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you know how many items there are.</v>

65
00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.913
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

66
00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:32.563
<v Speaker 1>the final point I'll make on this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it seems after a number of studies </v>

67
00:03:35.551 --> 00:03:36.384
<v Speaker 1>that human beings are not the only ones </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to make quantitative judgements </v>

68
00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.810
<v Speaker 1>about objects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certain species of monkey,</v>

69
00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.770
<v Speaker 1>horse and bird can subsidize </v>
<v Speaker 1>interestingly like us,</v>

70
00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:47.783
<v Speaker 1>up to about four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The best review that I found of </v>

71
00:03:49.591 --> 00:03:50.424
<v Speaker 1>numerical competence in animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well worth a read was done in 2011 bite </v>

72
00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.980
<v Speaker 1>Zana Resonant Cova and Boris Rye out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry for the name butchery,</v>

73
00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.610
<v Speaker 1>which I'll leave a link for in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>description under worksite and follow me</v>

74
00:04:02.611 --> 00:04:05.160
<v Speaker 1>on Tumblr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Asked me anything on Tumbler and twitter</v>

75
00:04:05.161 --> 00:04:08.700
<v Speaker 1>for short little thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comment below and I will respond.</v>

76
00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:09.593
<v Speaker 1>I will respond to everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also post this on Reddit if you like </v>

77
00:04:12.811 --> 00:04:13.644
<v Speaker 1>what I do and want me to keep doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That has been a great way for people to </v>

78
00:04:16.231 --> 00:04:19.980
<v Speaker 1>see these and just get the word about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the nerd writer out there.</v>

79
00:04:19.981 --> 00:04:20.814
<v Speaker 1>So if you like the nerd writer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>post this on Reddit and I will see you </v>

80
00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.190
<v Speaker 1>next Monday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

81
00:04:25.191 --> 00:04:26.024
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>
