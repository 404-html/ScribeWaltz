1
00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.650
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>welcome.</v>

2
00:00:01.651 --> 00:00:02.484
<v Speaker 1>Thank you so much for coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it took a lot of work to get this </v>

3
00:00:06.121 --> 00:00:06.954
<v Speaker 1>play off the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say too much because I </v>

4
00:00:08.791 --> 00:00:09.624
<v Speaker 1>don't want to spoil anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all I'll say is I hope you enjoy </v>

5
00:00:12.961 --> 00:00:15.360
<v Speaker 1>this as much as we enjoyed making it</v>

6
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.240
<v Speaker 2>either basic purpose of art is to </v>
<v Speaker 2>eliminate human nature.</v>

7
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:23.423
<v Speaker 2>Then I think comedy central's Nathan for</v>
<v Speaker 2>you deserves a spot in the conversation </v>

8
00:00:26.591 --> 00:00:28.900
<v Speaker 2>about the best tv shows of this era.</v>

9
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.870
<v Speaker 1>A while ago I was working with a juggle </v>
<v Speaker 1>child.</v>

10
00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:32.973
<v Speaker 1>His name was a dandy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a great inspiration for me and </v>

11
00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:37.383
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tragically he died and when baboons </v>

12
00:00:39.971 --> 00:00:42.090
<v Speaker 1>kidnapped and ate him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not</v>

13
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.960
<v Speaker 2>only is it so funny that I cry laughing </v>
<v Speaker 2>at almost every episode,</v>

14
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.400
<v Speaker 2>but it reveals small truths about human </v>
<v Speaker 2>nature in a way that's unique.</v>

15
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.340
<v Speaker 2>I think for television in this episode,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

16
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.203
<v Speaker 2>Nathan on his never ending quest to help</v>
<v Speaker 2>small businesses meets a bar owner who </v>

17
00:00:58.531 --> 00:01:03.531
<v Speaker 2>says her bottom line was cut in half by </v>
<v Speaker 2>laws that prohibit smoking indoors.</v>

18
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:04.913
<v Speaker 2>So to fix this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nathan finds a legal loophole that says </v>

19
00:01:07.411 --> 00:01:11.880
<v Speaker 2>people can smoke inside if the smoking </v>
<v Speaker 2>is part of a theatrical production,</v>

20
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.953
<v Speaker 2>so we tell smokers to come back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then invites a couple of theater goers </v>

21
00:01:16.081 --> 00:01:16.914
<v Speaker 2>to sit in a special audience section </v>
<v Speaker 2>where they think they're watching a </v>

22
00:01:20.671 --> 00:01:21.504
<v Speaker 2>legitimate play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so funny because it's like so </v>

23
00:01:23.791 --> 00:01:27.660
<v Speaker 2>nothing in a way but incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 2>profound.</v>

24
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.553
<v Speaker 2>There are three categories of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>involved in this scheme and the each </v>

25
00:01:31.471 --> 00:01:33.600
<v Speaker 2>know different things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

26
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.760
<v Speaker 2>four categories if you're counting </v>
<v Speaker 2>Nathan,</v>

27
00:01:35.761 --> 00:01:37.170
<v Speaker 2>but we'll get to him later.</v>

28
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.750
<v Speaker 2>The first is ellen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bar owner.</v>

29
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.860
<v Speaker 2>She thinks Nathan is a business </v>
<v Speaker 2>consultant with a reality TV show who is</v>

30
00:01:43.861 --> 00:01:47.640
<v Speaker 2>genuinely trying to help her by </v>
<v Speaker 2>exploiting a loophole in the law.</v>

31
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:48.593
<v Speaker 2>Then there are the bars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>patrons who think they found a place to </v>

32
00:01:51.181 --> 00:01:54.030
<v Speaker 2>smoke inside without reproach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unlike Ellen,</v>

33
00:01:54.031 --> 00:01:56.580
<v Speaker 2>the patrons don't know about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>theatrical framing,</v>

34
00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.473
<v Speaker 2>presumably thinking that the audience </v>
<v Speaker 2>section is just another seating area in </v>

35
00:02:00.901 --> 00:02:02.040
<v Speaker 2>the bar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Finally,</v>

36
00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.690
<v Speaker 2>there are the theater goers who don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>know about the business consultation and</v>

37
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.480
<v Speaker 2>genuinely think they're seeing an </v>
<v Speaker 2>experimental production.</v>

38
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.780
<v Speaker 2>There are a lot of ways that you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>read this show.</v>

39
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.210
<v Speaker 2>Full fat videos made an excellent piece </v>
<v Speaker 2>recently on how Nathan,</v>

40
00:02:15.211 --> 00:02:18.270
<v Speaker 2>for you satirizes the phenomenon of fake</v>
<v Speaker 2>news.</v>

41
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.160
<v Speaker 2>I'll link to it below,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely check that out,</v>

42
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:21.293
<v Speaker 2>but one of the other key things I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>Nathan is interested in here is showing </v>

43
00:02:23.941 --> 00:02:24.774
<v Speaker 2>us how people really act when normal </v>
<v Speaker 2>expectations are met with absurd </v>

44
00:02:29.161 --> 00:02:29.994
<v Speaker 2>circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As John Teddy of the navy club once </v>

45
00:02:32.341 --> 00:02:33.174
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fielder uses the rank artificiality of </v>

46
00:02:35.581 --> 00:02:40.581
<v Speaker 2>TV and TV making to extract this </v>
<v Speaker 2>surprising authenticity out of people.</v>

47
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.250
<v Speaker 2>Everybody involved in this setup knows </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're being filmed.</v>

48
00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.263
<v Speaker 2>They just don't know what they're being </v>
<v Speaker 2>filmed for or rather what they think </v>

49
00:02:48.691 --> 00:02:49.524
<v Speaker 2>they're being filmed for is wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the dramatic irony opened up by the </v>

50
00:02:52.981 --> 00:02:56.010
<v Speaker 2>difference between what they think and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what we know.</v>

51
00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.400
<v Speaker 2>Let's a realness in their character </v>
<v Speaker 2>slipped through our realness.</v>

52
00:03:00.401 --> 00:03:01.930
<v Speaker 2>They don't even know they're offering</v>

53
00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.893
<v Speaker 3>the couple stands out to me because it </v>
<v Speaker 3>tells a story that maybe they're in a </v>

54
00:03:07.431 --> 00:03:08.264
<v Speaker 3>new relationship and I think that </v>
<v Speaker 3>curiosity is what makes me want to </v>

55
00:03:12.411 --> 00:03:16.460
<v Speaker 3>continue to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think this has theatrical merit?</v>

56
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:22.170
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is slice of life theater and uh,</v>

57
00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.290
<v Speaker 3>for that aspect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's important</v>

58
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.233
<v Speaker 2>for Nathan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one level of artificiality is never </v>

59
00:03:27.551 --> 00:03:30.820
<v Speaker 2>enough spurred on by the real praise of </v>
<v Speaker 2>his fake play.</v>

60
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.520
<v Speaker 2>He transcribes the real actions of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>patrons,</v>

61
00:03:33.521 --> 00:03:34.354
<v Speaker 2>turns it into a real script,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and hire is real actors to play all the </v>

62
00:03:37.601 --> 00:03:40.570
<v Speaker 2>parts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then he invites a real audience to watch</v>

63
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.960
<v Speaker 2>a real play,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is all based on fakeness.</v>

64
00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:45.161
<v Speaker 2>This time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>however,</v>

65
00:03:45.161 --> 00:03:45.994
<v Speaker 2>all the people involved are aligned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The actress think they're participating </v>

66
00:03:48.641 --> 00:03:49.474
<v Speaker 2>in a play and they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The audience thinks they're watching a </v>

67
00:03:51.701 --> 00:03:54.910
<v Speaker 2>play and they are an ellen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

68
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.620
<v Speaker 2>who the hell knows what Elon thinks at </v>
<v Speaker 2>this point?</v>

69
00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.890
<v Speaker 2>The only two categories of people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>really know better are Nathan and us.</v>

70
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:03.543
<v Speaker 2>The original pretense of the episode,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Helping Ellen with her business problem </v>

71
00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:07.293
<v Speaker 2>is gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To have the external omniscient </v>

72
00:04:09.341 --> 00:04:12.610
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you actually need to know about the show</v>

73
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.830
<v Speaker 2>Nathan for you and what it's all about.</v>

74
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.933
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what this moment is effectively </v>

75
00:04:17.561 --> 00:04:18.394
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's demonstrating the premise of the </v>

76
00:04:20.261 --> 00:04:23.530
<v Speaker 2>show itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope you enjoy this play as much as we</v>

77
00:04:23.531 --> 00:04:24.364
<v Speaker 2>enjoyed making it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One aspect of this episode and really a </v>

78
00:04:27.011 --> 00:04:31.000
<v Speaker 2>theme of the whole series is Nathan's </v>
<v Speaker 2>desperate attempts to connect with other</v>

79
00:04:31.001 --> 00:04:31.834
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of the time we're encouraged to </v>

80
00:04:33.491 --> 00:04:38.491
<v Speaker 2>believe that Nathan is making people </v>
<v Speaker 2>uncomfortable for our benefit so that he</v>

81
00:04:38.561 --> 00:04:40.260
<v Speaker 2>can reveal them to us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

82
00:04:40.261 --> 00:04:41.860
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't want to be a third wheel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

83
00:04:41.861 --> 00:04:43.030
<v Speaker 2>that's what it would be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

84
00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.830
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

85
00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:44.663
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the show also encourages us to </v>

86
00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.720
<v Speaker 2>question that idea sometimes intensely</v>

87
00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.780
<v Speaker 3>look into my eyes and say,</v>

88
00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:58.430
<v Speaker 4>I love you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love you again.</v>

89
00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:05.060
<v Speaker 4>I love you again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love you again.</v>

90
00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:16.250
<v Speaker 4>I love you again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love you.</v>

91
00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:27.410
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love you.</v>

92
00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.480
<v Speaker 4>Got It.</v>

93
00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.680
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

94
00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:39.530
<v Speaker 2>What you begin to realize is that no </v>
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>

95
00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.070
<v Speaker 2>not even the TV audience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can have a more omniscient perspective.</v>

96
00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.233
<v Speaker 2>The nathans own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's only ever one man behind the </v>

97
00:05:47.001 --> 00:05:47.834
<v Speaker 2>curtain though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The show does make a pretty strong </v>

98
00:05:50.181 --> 00:05:51.014
<v Speaker 2>argument that he too is unsure of </v>
<v Speaker 2>whether there's anything at the core of </v>

99
00:05:54.951 --> 00:05:58.190
<v Speaker 2>all these layers of artifice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of weird having cameras</v>

100
00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:59.023
<v Speaker 4>around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

101
00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:05.980
<v Speaker 4>We can turn them off with a good way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like that.</v>

102
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:11.990
<v Speaker 4>Does that defeat the purpose?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

103
00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.300
<v Speaker 4>What's the purpose,</v>

104
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:15.643
<v Speaker 2>Nathan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for you is hands down one of the </v>

105
00:06:16.761 --> 00:06:17.594
<v Speaker 2>funniest shows and TV history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm obviously a huge fan and I've seen </v>

106
00:06:21.171 --> 00:06:22.004
<v Speaker 2>some major results physically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's more to this show within </v>

107
00:06:25.671 --> 00:06:26.504
<v Speaker 2>just comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nathan uses comedy and the construct of </v>

108
00:06:29.091 --> 00:06:34.091
<v Speaker 2>television to let us see into people's </v>
<v Speaker 2>souls these little interactions,</v>

109
00:06:34.491 --> 00:06:37.220
<v Speaker 2>these moments of awkwardness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>insincerity,</v>

110
00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.410
<v Speaker 2>what people are willing to say for </v>
<v Speaker 2>success,</v>

111
00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:43.160
<v Speaker 2>what people are willing to go along with</v>
<v Speaker 2>to preserve the status quo.</v>

112
00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.530
<v Speaker 2>These are the building blocks of </v>
<v Speaker 2>culture.</v>

113
00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.500
<v Speaker 2>In the later chapters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it actually says you spend a lot of time</v>

114
00:06:48.501 --> 00:06:52.160
<v Speaker 2>volunteering with jungle children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know what that is,</v>

115
00:06:52.161 --> 00:06:55.610
<v Speaker 2>but you might want to bring it out </v>
<v Speaker 2>because audiences love someone who gives</v>

116
00:06:55.611 --> 00:06:57.400
<v Speaker 2>back and is charitable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

117
00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:58.970
<v Speaker 2>but I'll be able to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell them,</v>

118
00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:00.013
<v Speaker 2>you know what they want to hear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can be shocking to see people like </v>

119
00:07:02.181 --> 00:07:06.200
<v Speaker 2>this and part of the reason we laugh is </v>
<v Speaker 2>to express this shock,</v>

120
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:08.870
<v Speaker 2>this embarrassment that seeing someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>so nakedly,</v>

121
00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:14.030
<v Speaker 2>but I think this laughter is recognition</v>
<v Speaker 2>to in the end,</v>

122
00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:15.073
<v Speaker 2>these people are really no different </v>
<v Speaker 2>than us who knows how we would react if </v>

<v Speaker 2>schemes without knowing it</v>

124
