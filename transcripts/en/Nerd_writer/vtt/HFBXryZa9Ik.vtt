1
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:04.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:05.743
<v Speaker 2>you often hear from people who don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>live in New York City and having lived </v>

3
00:00:09.141 --> 00:00:09.974
<v Speaker 2>in New York City that they couldn't live</v>
<v Speaker 2>in New York City because they're not </v>

4
00:00:13.251 --> 00:00:14.084
<v Speaker 2>that kind of person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's always struck me as strange and </v>

5
00:00:16.431 --> 00:00:17.264
<v Speaker 2>somewhat incomprehensible thing to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Being myself in New York City and </v>

6
00:00:20.751 --> 00:00:24.760
<v Speaker 2>meeting everyday people who because they</v>
<v Speaker 2>live here must be that kind of person.</v>

7
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.120
<v Speaker 2>It's strange because taking together all</v>
<v Speaker 2>of them,</v>

8
00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.450
<v Speaker 2>the web of their qualities and desires </v>
<v Speaker 2>and flaws,</v>

9
00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.450
<v Speaker 2>I can't quite envision the types who are</v>
<v Speaker 2>left out.</v>

10
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.170
<v Speaker 2>The thing is I don't trust them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't trust that they haven't confused</v>

11
00:00:36.171 --> 00:00:39.350
<v Speaker 2>and idea of New York City for the real </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing and for that matter,</v>

12
00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.040
<v Speaker 2>I don't trust that they haven't confused</v>
<v Speaker 2>and idea of themselves.</v>

13
00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:43.903
<v Speaker 2>For the real New York,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's conventionally thought is big and </v>

14
00:00:46.011 --> 00:00:49.370
<v Speaker 2>loud and fast and drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Edit is those things</v>

15
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.150
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

16
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.233
<v Speaker 2>but New York can be as small as it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>big as quiet and slow as it is loud and </v>

17
00:01:20.651 --> 00:01:21.484
<v Speaker 2>fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The city when viewed from within is </v>

18
00:01:22.781 --> 00:01:25.120
<v Speaker 2>really a collection of peculiar </v>
<v Speaker 2>neighborhoods,</v>

19
00:01:25.121 --> 00:01:27.490
<v Speaker 2>which is to say a collection of Charles </v>
<v Speaker 2>is my friend now,</v>

20
00:01:27.491 --> 00:01:29.560
<v Speaker 2>this is Jerry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Each has their own secrets.</v>

21
00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:30.453
<v Speaker 2>Each has their own weird identities and </v>
<v Speaker 2>each has their own set of random </v>

22
00:01:33.491 --> 00:01:36.280
<v Speaker 2>accumulated rules like when the horses </v>
<v Speaker 2>come out at 2:00</v>

23
00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.113
<v Speaker 2>AM on Essex in the lower east side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or when the wealthy folk go out to get </v>

24
00:01:39.311 --> 00:01:41.590
<v Speaker 2>their brunch on Sunday mornings in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>upper west,</v>

25
00:01:41.591 --> 00:01:45.250
<v Speaker 2>or how we all just assume that street </v>
<v Speaker 2>meat is perfectly safe because it tastes</v>

26
00:01:45.251 --> 00:01:46.870
<v Speaker 2>so good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mustard,</v>

27
00:01:46.871 --> 00:01:49.540
<v Speaker 2>please copious amounts of mustard </v>
<v Speaker 2>always,</v>

28
00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:51.223
<v Speaker 2>always pagel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These neighborhoods cohere around </v>

29
00:01:53.171 --> 00:01:54.004
<v Speaker 2>equality common to all but by a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the consignee and family resemblance by </v>

30
00:01:57.551 --> 00:02:01.570
<v Speaker 2>a series of overlapping similarities </v>
<v Speaker 2>like the series of overlapping character</v>

31
00:02:01.571 --> 00:02:04.990
<v Speaker 2>traits that give to it's eight point 2 </v>
<v Speaker 2>million inhabitants,</v>

32
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.610
<v Speaker 2>a kindred bond and a bond that holds </v>
<v Speaker 2>fast in tragedy and paint.</v>

33
00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:10.473
<v Speaker 2>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what makes being in New York City </v>

34
00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.640
<v Speaker 2>extraordinary is the feeling of standing</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the knife's edge of history.</v>

35
00:02:15.641 --> 00:02:19.300
<v Speaker 2>What it must've felt like to be at Rome </v>
<v Speaker 2>during the caesars were at London in the</v>

36
00:02:19.301 --> 00:02:20.134
<v Speaker 2>height of empire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's as if you're surfing the wave of </v>

37
00:02:22.421 --> 00:02:26.560
<v Speaker 2>time and you can see what's coming and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see every expression of humanity</v>

38
00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.980
<v Speaker 2>amplified and multiplied,</v>
<v Speaker 2>made stranger and more tolerant.</v>

39
00:02:29.981 --> 00:02:33.040
<v Speaker 2>New York overwhelms you into a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>unceasing Oh,</v>

40
00:02:33.041 --> 00:02:36.370
<v Speaker 2>and you could feel everything on every </v>
<v Speaker 2>corner all the time.</v>

41
00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:37.323
<v Speaker 2>There are a lot of hedonists in New York</v>
<v Speaker 2>City and a lot of good people that it </v>

42
00:02:40.541 --> 00:02:42.790
<v Speaker 2>may be the best place in the universe </v>
<v Speaker 2>anyway.</v>

43
00:02:42.791 --> 00:02:45.250
<v Speaker 2>It's the best place in the universe to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get a drink at four in the morning.</v>

44
00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:46.920
<v Speaker 2>Yep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

45
00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.883
<v Speaker 2>Come in.</v>
