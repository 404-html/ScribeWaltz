00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.290
<v Speaker 1>Coffee on a Tuesday and block 16.</v>

2
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.270
<v Speaker 2>I should start by saying I'm more of an </v>
<v Speaker 2>atheist than it is.</v>

3
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:24.383
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my view is not just that there is no </v>

4
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.570
<v Speaker 2>reason to believe that there is a deity </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that all the arguments that there is</v>

5
00:00:30.571 --> 00:00:34.110
<v Speaker 2>one have long since been exploded by </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophers,</v>

6
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.470
<v Speaker 2>astronomers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>scientists,</v>

7
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.150
<v Speaker 2>physicists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>biologists and so forth.</v>

8
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.710
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mainly by philosophers,</v>

9
00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:41.563
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my opinion,</v>

10
00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.823
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that it's a good thing that that's </v>

11
00:00:44.161 --> 00:00:44.994
<v Speaker 2>not okay.</v>

12
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.460
<v Speaker 1>How do we describe Christopher Hitchens </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a writer,</v>

13
00:00:47.461 --> 00:00:48.151
<v Speaker 1>journalist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>teacher,</v>

14
00:00:48.151 --> 00:00:50.230
<v Speaker 1>political commentator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>contrarion atheists,</v>

15
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.100
<v Speaker 1>extremely adept debater as a champion of</v>
<v Speaker 1>truth,</v>

16
00:00:53.101 --> 00:00:54.080
<v Speaker 1>democracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whiskey,</v>

17
00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.430
<v Speaker 1>and a piece of advice his mother gave </v>
<v Speaker 1>him when he was just a young boy,</v>

18
00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.620
<v Speaker 1>that the only unforgivable sin is to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>born.</v>

19
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.503
<v Speaker 1>Yvonne's advice was never forgot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It became one of the most successful at </v>

20
00:01:02.671 --> 00:01:05.040
<v Speaker 1>penetrating thinkers of his time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Publishing several books,</v>

21
00:01:05.041 --> 00:01:07.350
<v Speaker 1>tearing down sacred cows from Mother </v>
<v Speaker 1>Teresa.</v>

22
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.610
<v Speaker 1>Fanatical Albanian</v>

23
00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.160
<v Speaker 2>dwarf lying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thieving of Bill Clinton.</v>

24
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:12.580
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he is even by,</v>

25
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:14.783
<v Speaker 2>even by the most relaxed standard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an unusually hollow and empty and cold </v>

26
00:01:18.421 --> 00:01:20.520
<v Speaker 2>individually and completely ruthless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Henry Kissinger,</v>

27
00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.393
<v Speaker 2>criminal is Henry [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 2>Job description on has been since you </v>

28
00:01:25.021 --> 00:01:26.330
<v Speaker 2>first caught Richard Nixon's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

29
00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.213
<v Speaker 1>I had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one and only got the Christian </v>

30
00:01:28.841 --> 00:01:30.580
<v Speaker 1>answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course you have freewill.</v>

31
00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.590
<v Speaker 1>The boss insists upon it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You lionized Jefferson,</v>

32
00:01:35.591 --> 00:01:36.640
<v Speaker 1>Orwell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thomas Paine.</v>

33
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.830
<v Speaker 1>He wrote columns for Vanity Fair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slate magazine,</v>

34
00:01:38.831 --> 00:01:39.664
<v Speaker 1>the Atlantic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a prolific and viber and inhaler </v>

35
00:01:40.841 --> 00:01:42.820
<v Speaker 1>two things which no doubt shortened his </v>
<v Speaker 1>life in the end,</v>

36
00:01:42.821 --> 00:01:46.270
<v Speaker 1>but he was too smart not to know that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you get out of alcohol,</v>

37
00:01:46.271 --> 00:01:49.150
<v Speaker 1>what you put into it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as he was a scotch man like me and a</v>

38
00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:50.043
<v Speaker 1>Johnny Walker man like me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can only say simply everything in </v>

39
00:01:55.141 --> 00:01:55.974
<v Speaker 1>moderation.</v>

40
00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.000
<v Speaker 1>Take two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as he was a scotch man like me and a</v>

41
00:02:02.001 --> 00:02:04.760
<v Speaker 1>Johnny Walker man like me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can only say three.</v>

42
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.970
<v Speaker 1>Take for everything in moderation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Takes Breakfast of champions.</v>

43
00:02:11.541 --> 00:02:13.490
<v Speaker 1>League is work for yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Agree with him or done.</v>

44
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.140
<v Speaker 1>My Point is not to vindicate his.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To me.</v>

45
00:02:15.141 --> 00:02:16.310
<v Speaker 1>Christopher hitchens represents </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

46
00:02:16.311 --> 00:02:20.030
<v Speaker 1>The world is always in short supply of </v>
<v Speaker 1>men and women of letters,</v>

47
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.953
<v Speaker 1>intellectual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one apologetic for being so sometime in </v>

48
00:02:22.761 --> 00:02:23.594
<v Speaker 1>the last couple of centuries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectuals lost their credit and the </v>

49
00:02:24.981 --> 00:02:25.814
<v Speaker 1>western world and just when they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing so good in the enlightenment in </v>

50
00:02:27.831 --> 00:02:28.664
<v Speaker 1>our time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the word intellectual has come to be </v>

51
00:02:29.421 --> 00:02:32.900
<v Speaker 1>synonymous with pretend anti </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectualism isn't old and repetitive</v>

52
00:02:32.901 --> 00:02:34.580
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It made itself a home in Mussolini's,</v>

53
00:02:34.581 --> 00:02:35.810
<v Speaker 1>Italy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stalin's Russia,</v>

54
00:02:35.811 --> 00:02:36.644
<v Speaker 1>Hitler's Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you can trace it back in time </v>

55
00:02:37.761 --> 00:02:38.594
<v Speaker 1>through religion all the way to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>death of socrates or you can move </v>

56
00:02:40.221 --> 00:02:42.860
<v Speaker 1>forward in time to the populist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Politicians like George W,</v>

57
00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.230
<v Speaker 3>but I like to mountain bike.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I liked country music on my ipod</v>

58
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:48.383
<v Speaker 1>strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're intellectuals are pitted against </v>

59
00:02:48.901 --> 00:02:51.930
<v Speaker 1>the uncorrupt salt of the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good to have a beer with folk like this.</v>

60
00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.630
<v Speaker 1>Anti intellectual wisdom is troubling in</v>
<v Speaker 1>all its manifestations,</v>

61
00:02:54.631 --> 00:02:56.910
<v Speaker 1>but maybe nowhere more so than in youth </v>
<v Speaker 1>court.</v>

62
00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:00.070
<v Speaker 3>They</v>

63
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.730
<v Speaker 4>are impressionable and they have the </v>
<v Speaker 4>cash.</v>

64
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.140
<v Speaker 4>They are corporate America's $150 </v>
<v Speaker 4>million dollar dream.</v>

65
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.153
<v Speaker 1>The idea here is that the advertising </v>
<v Speaker 1>industry has transformed the language </v>

66
00:03:11.231 --> 00:03:13.900
<v Speaker 1>thought and actions of teenagers into </v>
<v Speaker 1>commodities.</v>

67
00:03:13.901 --> 00:03:17.350
<v Speaker 1>In order to sell them popularity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>creating a generation who was completely</v>

68
00:03:17.351 --> 00:03:19.570
<v Speaker 1>uninterested in maturing to adult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but take this how you want.</v>

69
00:03:19.571 --> 00:03:22.900
<v Speaker 1>There is certainly a good point here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I saw in myself and others as a</v>

70
00:03:22.901 --> 00:03:25.990
<v Speaker 1>young teenager was that being an idiot </v>
<v Speaker 1>is ease.</v>

71
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.833
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing when you're an idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything that comes out of your mouth </v>

72
00:03:28.361 --> 00:03:31.330
<v Speaker 1>is idiotic with no work at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you want to be intelligent,</v>

73
00:03:31.331 --> 00:03:32.980
<v Speaker 1>everything you say requires a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>

74
00:03:32.981 --> 00:03:35.710
<v Speaker 1>a little bit of thought and effort to </v>
<v Speaker 1>compose yourself,</v>

75
00:03:35.711 --> 00:03:38.380
<v Speaker 1>so it's not to be inane or contradictory</v>
<v Speaker 1>or redundant,</v>

76
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:39.880
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean that intellectuals can't be</v>
<v Speaker 1>silly.</v>

77
00:03:39.881 --> 00:03:42.730
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean that we can't turn our </v>
<v Speaker 1>brains off every once in a while.</v>

78
00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:43.840
<v Speaker 1>We all need them.</v>

79
00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.540
<v Speaker 1>Well being an intellectual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter how you slice it is hard.</v>

80
00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:50.403
<v Speaker 1>It takes introspection and time and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>willingness to be critical of yourself </v>

81
00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.020
<v Speaker 1>and it never stops being hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gets harder.</v>

82
00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.420
<v Speaker 1>The reward is that hard work becomes the</v>
<v Speaker 1>reward.</v>

83
00:03:58.421 --> 00:04:02.340
<v Speaker 1>Learning becomes a commodity as bright </v>
<v Speaker 1>and infinitely renewable as the sun.</v>

84
00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.210
<v Speaker 1>Everyone can and should be an </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual,</v>

85
00:04:04.211 --> 00:04:07.720
<v Speaker 1>whether you're a doctor or a plumber or </v>
<v Speaker 1>a president or a germ.</v>

86
00:04:07.721 --> 00:04:09.790
<v Speaker 1>All it takes is putting yourself on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>record.</v>

87
00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:10.624
<v Speaker 1>It takes writing something and </v>
<v Speaker 1>submitting it to the public for if </v>

88
00:04:12.581 --> 00:04:13.540
<v Speaker 1>you're a painter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lawyer,</v>

89
00:04:13.541 --> 00:04:14.410
<v Speaker 1>filmmaker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dancer,</v>

90
00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.080
<v Speaker 1>that's great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but still right,</v>

91
00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:17.070
<v Speaker 1>musician,</v>
<v Speaker 1>engineer,</v>

92
00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:18.100
<v Speaker 1>diplomat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>accountant.</v>

93
00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.950
<v Speaker 1>Fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What still words or the units of thought</v>

94
00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.860
<v Speaker 1>and if you listen to anything I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let it be this.</v>

95
00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:27.880
<v Speaker 1>We learn by saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not think ideas are like clouds.</v>

96
00:04:27.881 --> 00:04:29.920
<v Speaker 1>You can't hold onto when we compose a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sentence,</v>

97
00:04:29.921 --> 00:04:30.754
<v Speaker 1>we make the idea of solid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then we can put it in our pockets and </v>

98
00:04:33.731 --> 00:04:34.540
<v Speaker 1>take it with us.</v>

99
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.430
<v Speaker 2>What do you think it takes to lead a </v>
<v Speaker 2>good life?</v>

100
00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.620
<v Speaker 2>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm irony.</v>

101
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:43.323
<v Speaker 2>I'm literature as the source of </v>
<v Speaker 2>reflection on moral and ethical and </v>

102
00:04:47.591 --> 00:04:48.424
<v Speaker 2>human topics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm laughing at the misfortunes of </v>

103
00:04:51.461 --> 00:04:53.810
<v Speaker 2>others that gets me through it all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

104
00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:57.110
<v Speaker 2>I love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

105
00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.340
<v Speaker 2>and some of the things that go with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

106
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.400
<v Speaker 2>the possibility of passing on your genes</v>
<v Speaker 2>to children,</v>

107
00:05:03.401 --> 00:05:04.950
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any kind of immortality or whatever.</v>

108
00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.440
<v Speaker 2>And did I mention this already?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Laughing at the misfortune of others.</v>

109
00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:10.720
<v Speaker 2>And it will be improved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

110
00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:11.783
<v Speaker 2>I'm being vindicated in arguments that </v>
<v Speaker 2>other people wish they hadn't had with </v>

111
00:05:15.281 --> 00:05:16.690
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to say,</v>

112
00:05:16.691 --> 00:05:18.620
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was Roman.</v>

113
00:05:18.621 --> 00:05:19.454
<v Speaker 2>You are right.</v>
