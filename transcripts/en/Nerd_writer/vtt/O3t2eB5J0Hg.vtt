00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:05.730
<v Speaker 1>In the chaos of the last few months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've put a lot of things on hold,</v>

2
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:07.890
<v Speaker 1>not just the blog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also my writing it.</v>

3
00:00:07.891 --> 00:00:09.870
<v Speaker 1>Since those two things sort of go hand </v>
<v Speaker 1>in hand,</v>

4
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.000
<v Speaker 1>I want to start both up at the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

5
00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:15.450
<v Speaker 1>So I started working on a third book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I'm really excited about.</v>

6
00:00:15.451 --> 00:00:16.284
<v Speaker 1>Art Saifai.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've also started a new tumbler called </v>

7
00:00:18.091 --> 00:00:18.924
<v Speaker 1>52 bucks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>52 weeks in which it's exactly what it </v>

8
00:00:21.451 --> 00:00:22.284
<v Speaker 1>sounds like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea is that the people I work with </v>

9
00:00:23.071 --> 00:00:23.904
<v Speaker 1>are way more knowledgeable than me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this is how you know I will destroy </v>

10
00:00:26.581 --> 00:00:28.670
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel I've gotten into Lincoln,</v>

11
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.513
<v Speaker 1>the dubliner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've also started working on a new </v>

12
00:00:30.361 --> 00:00:30.960
<v Speaker 1>album.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

13
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.640
<v Speaker 1>You make music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

14
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.260
<v Speaker 1>but you already knew that</v>

15
00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.140
<v Speaker 2>interesting,</v>

16
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.343
<v Speaker 1>simple and unprofessional music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but know it makes me really happy and </v>

17
00:00:45.841 --> 00:00:48.930
<v Speaker 1>creative and I'll put it on soundcloud </v>
<v Speaker 1>when it's done.</v>

18
00:00:48.931 --> 00:00:51.690
<v Speaker 1>Now you might be saying nerdwriter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a job now,</v>

19
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.390
<v Speaker 1>aren't you putting too many things on </v>
<v Speaker 1>your plate too?</v>

20
00:00:54.391 --> 00:00:56.060
<v Speaker 1>Which you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can only say yes.</v>

21
00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:56.903
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I figure what's the use of having an </v>

22
00:00:57.661 --> 00:00:59.840
<v Speaker 1>appropriately full plate on the back?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mom,</v>

23
00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.260
<v Speaker 3>I just press the red bugging me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Recording.</v>

24
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

25
00:01:06.011 --> 00:01:07.000
<v Speaker 3>One more time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ready?</v>

26
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:08.721
<v Speaker 3>Shelly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you the one?</v>

27
00:01:08.721 --> 00:01:11.080
<v Speaker 3>I know it's videoing now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're videoing.</v>

28
00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:12.700
<v Speaker 3>Ready?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cool.</v>

29
00:01:12.701 --> 00:01:13.900
<v Speaker 3>Lily.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lily,</v>

30
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:16.660
<v Speaker 3>are you ready?</v>
