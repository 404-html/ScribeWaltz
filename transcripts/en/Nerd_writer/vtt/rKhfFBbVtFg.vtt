1
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.550
<v Speaker 1>This is the death of socrates by shock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Louis divvied completed in 1787.</v>

2
00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:23.350
<v Speaker 1>It is an exemplar of the neoclassical </v>
<v Speaker 1>period in France which divvied virtually</v>

3
00:00:23.961 --> 00:00:27.620
<v Speaker 1>created and brought to the fore himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before I say more,</v>

4
00:00:27.621 --> 00:00:30.950
<v Speaker 1>it's important to note just how striking</v>
<v Speaker 1>this canvas is,</v>

5
00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.880
<v Speaker 1>not knowing anything about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much jumps out at me right away.</v>

6
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.893
<v Speaker 1>The clarity of the scene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fierce gesture of the man in the </v>

7
00:00:38.331 --> 00:00:39.164
<v Speaker 1>middle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the interplay of the Chalice and the </v>

8
00:00:40.641 --> 00:00:44.030
<v Speaker 1>hand that reaches for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the angles of the light and the men,</v>

9
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.290
<v Speaker 1>the soft draping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>garments bear flat stone wall.</v>

10
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:49.693
<v Speaker 1>As the title suggests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the scene depicts the death of socrates </v>

11
00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.390
<v Speaker 1>told famously by Plato in his dialogue </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the soul,</v>

12
00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:57.343
<v Speaker 1>the Fito.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Socrates had been convicted in Athenian </v>

13
00:00:59.601 --> 00:01:00.434
<v Speaker 1>Court of failing to acknowledge the gods</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the city and corrupting the city's </v>

14
00:01:04.461 --> 00:01:07.640
<v Speaker 1>youth and sentenced to death by drinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>hemlock.</v>

15
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.100
<v Speaker 1>As Plato makes clear in another </v>
<v Speaker 1>dialogue,</v>

16
00:01:10.101 --> 00:01:13.670
<v Speaker 1>the crito.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Socrates could have escaped into exile,</v>

17
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:14.713
<v Speaker 1>but instead he chooses to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Taking the opportunity to teach his </v>

18
00:01:18.471 --> 00:01:22.580
<v Speaker 1>final lesson that death is not to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>feared by the philosopher,</v>

19
00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.760
<v Speaker 1>but embraced as an apotheosis of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>soul divvied chooses to paint the moment</v>

20
00:01:28.281 --> 00:01:29.114
<v Speaker 1>just as socrates is grabbing for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>poison draft he's been discussing at </v>

21
00:01:33.171 --> 00:01:34.004
<v Speaker 1>length the immortality of the soul and </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't even seem to care that he's </v>

22
00:01:37.341 --> 00:01:40.460
<v Speaker 1>about to take the implement of his death</v>
<v Speaker 1>in hand.</v>

23
00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.690
<v Speaker 1>On the contrary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>socrates is defined gesturing toward the</v>

24
00:01:44.691 --> 00:01:45.524
<v Speaker 1>afterlife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to which he hastens divvied idealizes </v>

25
00:01:48.591 --> 00:01:49.424
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Socrates would have been 70 at the time </v>

26
00:01:51.141 --> 00:01:54.950
<v Speaker 1>in somewhat less muscular and beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 1>than painted here.</v>

27
00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.993
<v Speaker 1>The raking light coming in from the top </v>
<v Speaker 1>left pours onto socrates the brightest </v>

28
00:02:00.321 --> 00:02:03.770
<v Speaker 1>figure in the tablo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The colors are muted at the sides,</v>

29
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:04.753
<v Speaker 1>become vivid in the center with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>executioner in red and socrates in </v>

30
00:02:08.601 --> 00:02:09.110
<v Speaker 1>white.</v>

31
00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.200
<v Speaker 1>For Davita.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Socrates is a symbol of strength,</v>

32
00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.093
<v Speaker 1>over passion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of STOIC commitment to an abstract </v>

33
00:02:15.531 --> 00:02:17.900
<v Speaker 1>principle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even in the face of death.</v>

34
00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.173
<v Speaker 1>This is the ethical message divvied </v>
<v Speaker 1>sought to offer the French two years </v>

35
00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:23.803
<v Speaker 1>before the French revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the monarchy was in decline and </v>

36
00:02:26.451 --> 00:02:30.230
<v Speaker 1>reformers ache to install a democracy </v>
<v Speaker 1>akin to that.</v>

37
00:02:30.231 --> 00:02:34.220
<v Speaker 1>Of Socrates own time in Greek antiquity </v>
<v Speaker 1>or of the United States,</v>

38
00:02:34.221 --> 00:02:38.090
<v Speaker 1>which had just executed its own </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution five years prior,</v>

39
00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.073
<v Speaker 1>indeed Thomas Jefferson himself was </v>
<v Speaker 1>present at the unveiling of this </v>

40
00:02:41.871 --> 00:02:42.704
<v Speaker 1>painting at the salon of 1787.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The image commissioned by two radical </v>

41
00:02:46.761 --> 00:02:47.594
<v Speaker 1>political reformers was wildly popular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>divvied had already made his name with </v>

42
00:02:51.891 --> 00:02:52.724
<v Speaker 1>another severe moralistic canvas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the oath of the ratio which effectively </v>

43
00:02:56.991 --> 00:02:57.824
<v Speaker 1>invented the neoclassical taking its </v>
<v Speaker 1>cues from the stark simplicity of </v>

44
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:02.553
<v Speaker 1>ancient Greece and Rome from the ancient</v>
<v Speaker 1>obsession with anatomy and musculature </v>

45
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:07.383
<v Speaker 1>from the two dimensional freezes </v>
<v Speaker 1>depicting historical events </v>

46
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.240
<v Speaker 1>neoclassicism as rendered by divvied </v>
<v Speaker 1>made its points strongly and severely.</v>

47
00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.200
<v Speaker 1>This was in direct opposition to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominant Rococo style that reflected the</v>

48
00:03:20.201 --> 00:03:24.230
<v Speaker 1>ornate and hedonistic lifestyles of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>monarchy in the horatio pie.</v>

49
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.083
<v Speaker 1>As in the death of socrates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those dedicated to principal are </v>

50
00:03:27.761 --> 00:03:28.594
<v Speaker 1>depicted with angular geometry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While those ruled by passion are curved </v>

51
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.340
<v Speaker 1>and weak in both canvases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the backgrounds are flat,</v>

52
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.880
<v Speaker 1>fixing attention on the foreground where</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a freeze,</v>

53
00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.520
<v Speaker 1>the action can be read from site to </v>
<v Speaker 1>site.</v>

54
00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:43.593
<v Speaker 1>One way to read the death of socrates is</v>
<v Speaker 1>right to left the anguish of socrates </v>

55
00:03:47.381 --> 00:03:48.214
<v Speaker 1>followers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>curling and twisting opens up onto the </v>

56
00:03:50.981 --> 00:03:51.814
<v Speaker 1>comm expression of the man himself and </v>
<v Speaker 1>flows down through his right arm which </v>

57
00:03:56.201 --> 00:04:00.040
<v Speaker 1>hovers over the cup of poison,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the space between the hand and the cup.</v>

58
00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:05.220
<v Speaker 1>The exact center of the image is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>seat of maximum narrative charge.</v>

59
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.370
<v Speaker 1>Then it falls back into the pain of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>man who delivers the poison,</v>

60
00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:10.383
<v Speaker 1>who turns his gaze away from socrates </v>
<v Speaker 1>and finally comes to rest on the man </v>

61
00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.730
<v Speaker 1>sitting at the foot of the bed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unengaged were on him in a moment.</v>

62
00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.640
<v Speaker 1>Davita doesn't identify anyone in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>painting,</v>

63
00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.820
<v Speaker 1>but we can infer from accounts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>socrates actual death.</v>

64
00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.360
<v Speaker 1>That in the background is socrates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wife is an anthropy,</v>

65
00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.890
<v Speaker 1>led away in distress and collecting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Socrates leg is cryto,</v>

66
00:04:32.891 --> 00:04:35.970
<v Speaker 1>his oldest and most faithful student </v>
<v Speaker 1>under credo.</v>

67
00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.410
<v Speaker 1>We can see that divvied has signed his </v>
<v Speaker 1>own name,</v>

68
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.440
<v Speaker 1>signaling a feeling of connection with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the man divvied weaker than his ideal of</v>

69
00:04:43.541 --> 00:04:47.590
<v Speaker 1>moral strength.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless grabs and strives toward it.</v>

70
00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:48.783
<v Speaker 1>The painter has taken a number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberties with history besides altering </v>

71
00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:52.863
<v Speaker 1>socrates face and physique divvied </v>
<v Speaker 1>decreases the number of people present </v>

72
00:04:56.231 --> 00:04:57.064
<v Speaker 1>at the event from over 15 to 12 echoing </v>
<v Speaker 1>the number of disciples at De Vinci's </v>

73
00:05:01.541 --> 00:05:02.374
<v Speaker 1>last supper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think the most significant change </v>

74
00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.600
<v Speaker 1>is that the addition of the character at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the foot of the bed.</v>

75
00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.853
<v Speaker 1>This is plato,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the man who popularized socrates </v>

76
00:05:11.771 --> 00:05:12.604
<v Speaker 1>teachings by staging him as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>protagonists in over 30 philosophical </v>

77
00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.890
<v Speaker 1>dialogues put simply without plato,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there would be no socrates.</v>

78
00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.710
<v Speaker 1>The two men melt into each other </v>
<v Speaker 1>historically.</v>

79
00:05:23.711 --> 00:05:24.544
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to determine where socrates </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy ends and Plato's begins not </v>

80
00:05:28.811 --> 00:05:31.330
<v Speaker 1>only was plato absent at the death of </v>
<v Speaker 1>socrates,</v>

81
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.060
<v Speaker 1>but he was a young man at the time here </v>
<v Speaker 1>at Davita,</v>

82
00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:34.923
<v Speaker 1>has some as old and withdrawn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said earlier that you can read the </v>

83
00:05:37.811 --> 00:05:38.644
<v Speaker 1>canvas from right to left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can also read it from left to </v>

84
00:05:42.041 --> 00:05:43.540
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole scene,</v>

85
00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:44.403
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>appears to explode out of the back of </v>

86
00:05:47.501 --> 00:05:51.220
<v Speaker 1>Plato's head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>recontextualizing it as a memory,</v>

87
00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:52.173
<v Speaker 1>an idealized memory in which socrates </v>
<v Speaker 1>gestures in the exact same way he does </v>

88
00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.320
<v Speaker 1>in Rafael's school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of Athens significantly,</v>

89
00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:01.243
<v Speaker 1>Plato is positioned apart from the flat </v>
<v Speaker 1>background where the frozen lateral </v>

90
00:06:05.931 --> 00:06:09.560
<v Speaker 1>moment gives way to the depth of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In reality,</v>

91
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.610
<v Speaker 1>it strikes me that this is the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>memories often fall out.</v>

92
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:16.820
<v Speaker 1>Restaged with smooth edges and perfect </v>
<v Speaker 1>light,</v>

93
00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:18.890
<v Speaker 1>two dimensional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>idealized,</v>

94
00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:23.960
<v Speaker 1>painstakingly arranged to serve the </v>
<v Speaker 1>needs of the present in the character of</v>

95
00:06:23.961 --> 00:06:24.794
<v Speaker 1>Plato.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rigorous ethical reality of the </v>

96
00:06:26.541 --> 00:06:27.374
<v Speaker 1>scene is betrayed by its own self </v>
<v Speaker 1>awareness as a construction and in only </v>

97
00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:33.493
<v Speaker 1>a few short years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the noble ideals of the French </v>

98
00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.440
<v Speaker 1>Revolution will be betrayed as well by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the terror that is to follow.</v>

99
00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:44.570
<v Speaker 1>Maybe this is why almost prophetically </v>
<v Speaker 1>divvied signs his name here,</v>

100
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:49.610
<v Speaker 1>a second time neoclassicism like this </v>
<v Speaker 1>may seem severe and blunt,</v>

101
00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:50.743
<v Speaker 1>but so much is happening in David's </v>
<v Speaker 1>death of socrates and interplay of </v>

102
00:06:54.471 --> 00:06:56.150
<v Speaker 1>historical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>personal,</v>

103
00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:57.013
<v Speaker 1>political and aesthetic elements </v>
<v Speaker 1>rendered forcefully suddenly and </v>

104
00:07:01.221 --> 00:07:02.990
<v Speaker 1>beautifully put.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another way,</v>

105
00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:05.480
<v Speaker 1>it's a work of genius.</v>

106
00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:15.950
<v Speaker 1>Hey everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to help me keep making these</v>
