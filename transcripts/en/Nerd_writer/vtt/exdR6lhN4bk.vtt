1
00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:04.140
<v Speaker 1>Let's just be honest with ourselves for </v>
<v Speaker 1>a minute.</v>

2
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.800
<v Speaker 1>Economics is a mind boggling discipline </v>
<v Speaker 1>for economists that's bad,</v>

3
00:00:10.231 --> 00:00:11.064
<v Speaker 1>but also sort of good news because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can make almost any argument stick if </v>

4
00:00:14.971 --> 00:00:17.460
<v Speaker 1>you just troll around in the data for </v>
<v Speaker 1>long enough,</v>

5
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.230
<v Speaker 1>but to the average person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the layman,</v>

6
00:00:19.231 --> 00:00:20.064
<v Speaker 1>it's a little bit different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The global economy must feel like a </v>

7
00:00:22.681 --> 00:00:23.514
<v Speaker 1>giant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hulking mass that grinds against the </v>

8
00:00:25.381 --> 00:00:30.000
<v Speaker 1>world unstoppable and on answerable to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the small problems of individuals.</v>

9
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.380
<v Speaker 1>So when your boss asks you to work </v>
<v Speaker 1>overtime but won't pay you for it,</v>

10
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.633
<v Speaker 1>you don't argue or demand to be paid </v>
<v Speaker 1>because how could an ant influence a </v>

11
00:00:38.881 --> 00:00:39.714
<v Speaker 1>conversation between people or when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>ask for a raise and the boss threatens </v>

12
00:00:43.411 --> 00:00:44.244
<v Speaker 1>to fire you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't stick up for yourself because </v>

13
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:47.173
<v Speaker 1>no raise is better than no job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Threats like these don't just function </v>

14
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.430
<v Speaker 1>on the level of individuals in many </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways.</v>

15
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.750
<v Speaker 1>It's how the entire American economy has</v>
<v Speaker 1>operated for almost 40 years.</v>

16
00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.823
<v Speaker 1>That's how you end up with a graph like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this which shows the wealthiest sliver </v>

17
00:01:02.491 --> 00:01:06.060
<v Speaker 1>of society getting virtually all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>gains from economic growth,</v>

18
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.820
<v Speaker 1>siphoning money from the middle class </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the poor.</v>

19
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.470
<v Speaker 1>Take a step back from this in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>democratic system which extends the vote</v>

20
00:01:13.471 --> 00:01:14.304
<v Speaker 1>to all citizens over 18.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to imagine how such a small </v>

21
00:01:18.001 --> 00:01:18.834
<v Speaker 1>percentage of people could convince the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rest to perpetuate a system that does </v>

22
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.233
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The truth is there's only one way to do </v>

23
00:01:27.241 --> 00:01:28.074
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to create an economic theory </v>

24
00:01:30.121 --> 00:01:30.954
<v Speaker 1>that makes the exploitation of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people look like the solution to their </v>

25
00:01:34.621 --> 00:01:36.390
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

26
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.350
<v Speaker 1>you have to tell a story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all the economy is.</v>

27
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.213
<v Speaker 1>It's a story that we tell ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a story that tells us what decisions to </v>

28
00:01:44.371 --> 00:01:46.380
<v Speaker 1>make about our own resources.</v>

29
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.980
<v Speaker 1>So what if your story is that lowering </v>
<v Speaker 1>taxes on the rich,</v>

30
00:01:49.981 --> 00:01:54.930
<v Speaker 1>especially on unearned income,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deregulating finance and privatizing the</v>

31
00:01:54.931 --> 00:01:59.910
<v Speaker 1>public comments is like taking the </v>
<v Speaker 1>living economy out of the shade and into</v>

32
00:01:59.911 --> 00:02:04.230
<v Speaker 1>the sun where it can flourish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a pretty good story and in fact,</v>

33
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.333
<v Speaker 1>those are the basics of a story that </v>
<v Speaker 1>have animated our politics and our </v>

34
00:02:08.401 --> 00:02:09.234
<v Speaker 1>economy since Ronald Reagan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a story that has produced advocates and </v>

35
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.990
<v Speaker 1>presidents on both sides of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>political spectrum.</v>

36
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.730
<v Speaker 1>This story didn't help the middle class </v>
<v Speaker 1>or the poor,</v>

37
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.960
<v Speaker 1>not really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their wages haven't risen since we began</v>

38
00:02:21.961 --> 00:02:22.794
<v Speaker 1>telling it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it did give the top one percent </v>

39
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.930
<v Speaker 1>greater access to and greater power over</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the best storytellers,</v>

40
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.240
<v Speaker 1>politicians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>academics,</v>

41
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.700
<v Speaker 1>and the media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To change the economy,</v>

42
00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.910
<v Speaker 1>you have to change the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A difficult thing to do,</v>

43
00:02:38.911 --> 00:02:42.810
<v Speaker 1>considering how much power has </v>
<v Speaker 1>consolidated in the hands of so few,</v>

44
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.220
<v Speaker 1>but it's not impossible.</v>

45
00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.560
<v Speaker 1>Take the minimum wage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

46
00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.490
<v Speaker 1>right now the federal minimum wage $7 </v>
<v Speaker 1>and twenty five cents an hour.</v>

47
00:02:50.491 --> 00:02:52.950
<v Speaker 1>That's about $15,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>a year.</v>

48
00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.820
<v Speaker 1>In 1968,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the minimum wage was a dollar 60,</v>

49
00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:57.683
<v Speaker 1>but when you adjust for inflation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that number it all the way up to $8 and </v>

50
00:03:00.671 --> 00:03:04.960
<v Speaker 1>fifty four cents an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a dollar and twenty nine cents more than</v>

51
00:03:04.961 --> 00:03:06.850
<v Speaker 1>it is today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

52
00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:07.723
<v Speaker 1>American worker productivity has never </v>
<v Speaker 1>stopped growing so much so that if the </v>

53
00:03:10.901 --> 00:03:13.030
<v Speaker 1>minimum wage kept pace with </v>
<v Speaker 1>productivity,</v>

54
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.300
<v Speaker 1>it would have been $21 an hour by now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so in the absence of federal action,</v>

55
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.340
<v Speaker 1>states have raised their own minimum </v>
<v Speaker 1>wages,</v>

56
00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.810
<v Speaker 1>30 of which are higher than the federal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most notably of all,</v>

57
00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.830
<v Speaker 1>California just voted to raise its </v>
<v Speaker 1>minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2022.</v>

58
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.173
<v Speaker 1>That's something that was unthinkable </v>
<v Speaker 1>even five years ago in New York did the </v>

59
00:03:35.081 --> 00:03:40.081
<v Speaker 1>same a short time after this movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fight for 15 is part of a new story.</v>

60
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.070
<v Speaker 1>The story that believes in finally </v>
<v Speaker 1>growing the wages of the middle class so</v>

61
00:03:45.071 --> 00:03:45.904
<v Speaker 1>that their collective purchasing power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their demand can grow the economy </v>

62
00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:50.253
<v Speaker 1>organically in a way that's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>dependent on speculation or financial </v>

63
00:03:53.891 --> 00:03:54.724
<v Speaker 1>bubbles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It believes in regulating the abuses of </v>

64
00:03:56.891 --> 00:03:57.724
<v Speaker 1>Wall Street and making what should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>accessible to all education and </v>

65
00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.530
<v Speaker 1>healthcare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of our comments,</v>

66
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.140
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are no shortage of articles.</v>

67
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.960
<v Speaker 1>Politicians or studies showing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

68
00:04:07.961 --> 00:04:11.710
<v Speaker 1>that increasing the minimum wage is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>risky gamble or a job killer.</v>

69
00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.370
<v Speaker 1>No shortage of doomsday forecasting that</v>
<v Speaker 1>prices would rise,</v>

70
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
<v Speaker 1>but remember that this status quo has a </v>
<v Speaker 1>huge interest in maintaining itself just</v>

71
00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.983
<v Speaker 1>like a boss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It uses threats to keep the society in </v>

72
00:04:25.511 --> 00:04:26.344
<v Speaker 1>line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's a Meta analysis of pretty much </v>

73
00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.570
<v Speaker 1>every single minimum wage study,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the closer to the top,</v>

74
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.210
<v Speaker 1>the more precise and accurate the study </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

75
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:35.373
<v Speaker 1>and this shows that all the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>comprehensive analysis of the minimum </v>

76
00:04:37.661 --> 00:04:41.980
<v Speaker 1>wage show that it would have little to </v>
<v Speaker 1>no negative effect on employment lows,</v>

77
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:43.323
<v Speaker 1>and yet it could raise the incomes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>standards of living of millions in </v>

78
00:04:47.591 --> 00:04:48.424
<v Speaker 1>places where the minimum wage has </v>
<v Speaker 1>increased like Seattle prices haven't </v>

79
00:04:51.041 --> 00:04:51.820
<v Speaker 1>skyrocketed.</v>

80
00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:52.653
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are actually able to buy the </v>

81
00:04:54.911 --> 00:04:59.620
<v Speaker 1>things they've consistently increased </v>
<v Speaker 1>their productivity to produce.</v>

82
00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:00.733
<v Speaker 1>Minimum wage increases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>won't solve all the problems in the </v>

83
00:05:03.251 --> 00:05:04.390
<v Speaker 1>economy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not even close,</v>

84
00:05:04.391 --> 00:05:05.224
<v Speaker 1>it's just one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the victory of an idea that runs </v>

85
00:05:08.591 --> 00:05:13.330
<v Speaker 1>counter to the dominant ideology is </v>
<v Speaker 1>hugely significant.</v>

86
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.490
<v Speaker 1>Otto von Bismarck said that politics is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the art of the possible,</v>

87
00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:20.043
<v Speaker 1>but I think that sometimes invoking the </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible is just another tactic and </v>

88
00:05:24.301 --> 00:05:25.134
<v Speaker 1>other negotiating strategy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another threat used on behalf of the </v>

89
00:05:28.391 --> 00:05:29.224
<v Speaker 1>status quo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To restrict the movement of alternative </v>

90
00:05:31.721 --> 00:05:32.554
<v Speaker 1>ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the story of this economy has been </v>

91
00:05:34.601 --> 00:05:37.750
<v Speaker 1>laboring under for 40 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is failing.</v>

92
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.780
<v Speaker 1>People feel it even if they don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>why.</v>

93
00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.580
<v Speaker 1>A moment like this is when alternative </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas can populate the center.</v>

94
00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:47.283
<v Speaker 1>So maybe it's time to stop leading with </v>
<v Speaker 1>what is possible and start leading with </v>

95
00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:58.350
<v Speaker 1>what's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey everybody,</v>
