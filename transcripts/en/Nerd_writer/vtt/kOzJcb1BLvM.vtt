00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:01.613
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

2
00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:10.290
<v Speaker 2>favorite conversation among film Geeks </v>
<v Speaker 2>is which Wes Anderson movie is the best.</v>

3
00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:11.853
<v Speaker 2>I love this conversation because there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>so much to love about all of them and </v>

4
00:00:14.891 --> 00:00:15.724
<v Speaker 2>you can't really argue with somebody who</v>
<v Speaker 2>picks rushmore or the royal tannenbaums </v>

5
00:00:18.761 --> 00:00:22.510
<v Speaker 2>where the Grand Budapest hotel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so really the conversation is less about</v>

6
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.630
<v Speaker 2>competition and more about how one </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular movie in this director,</v>

7
00:00:26.631 --> 00:00:29.620
<v Speaker 2>his filmography affected someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>personally.</v>

8
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:30.633
<v Speaker 2>How one particular angle of Anderson's </v>
<v Speaker 2>vision hit that person squarely in the </v>

9
00:00:34.571 --> 00:00:39.571
<v Speaker 2>face because of where or when or who </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were at that moment in their lives.</v>

10
00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:41.613
<v Speaker 2>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that film is the Darjeeling limited the </v>

11
00:00:43.541 --> 00:00:47.170
<v Speaker 2>story about three brothers on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>spiritual journey through India.</v>

12
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.280
<v Speaker 2>The brother who brings them together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Francis says the journey is about trust,</v>

13
00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.630
<v Speaker 2>but it's really about communication.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How after a year of not speaking and the</v>

14
00:00:55.631 --> 00:00:56.464
<v Speaker 2>lifetime of upper middle class anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their ability to talk with each other </v>

15
00:00:59.831 --> 00:01:00.664
<v Speaker 2>coherently has completely broken down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first conversation they have on the </v>

16
00:01:03.401 --> 00:01:05.140
<v Speaker 2>train tells you everything you need to </v>
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>

17
00:01:05.141 --> 00:01:05.974
<v Speaker 2>It plays like some hilarious group chat </v>
<v Speaker 2>where one or all three of the brothers </v>

18
00:01:09.701 --> 00:01:10.260
<v Speaker 2>has terrible</v>

19
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.330
<v Speaker 1>well cell service and struggles to keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>up the last two.</v>

20
00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.500
<v Speaker 1>You want to read a short story I wrote </v>
<v Speaker 1>in France.</v>

21
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.333
<v Speaker 2>I think everybody knows that close </v>
<v Speaker 2>friends and especially family don't </v>

22
00:01:37.011 --> 00:01:39.620
<v Speaker 2>always answer the questions that you ask</v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

23
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:40.493
<v Speaker 2>the answer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the question that they think your </v>

24
00:01:41.751 --> 00:01:42.584
<v Speaker 2>question implies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They try to anticipate where you're </v>

25
00:01:44.091 --> 00:01:46.910
<v Speaker 2>going at its best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This makes for a wonderful shorthand,</v>

26
00:01:46.911 --> 00:01:50.120
<v Speaker 2>but at it's worst,</v>
<v Speaker 2>assumptions like these can be incredibly</v>

27
00:01:50.121 --> 00:01:50.954
<v Speaker 2>frustrating and make for stilted </v>
<v Speaker 2>communication that never hits its mark </v>

28
00:01:53.781 --> 00:01:58.781
<v Speaker 2>with everyone zigzagging and working at </v>
<v Speaker 2>cross purposes in the Darjeeling Limited</v>

29
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.220
<v Speaker 2>Jack Francis and Peter's spend a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>time communicating to themselves through</v>

30
00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.470
<v Speaker 1>juggling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Raise us.</v>

31
00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:08.483
<v Speaker 2>Francis is especially guilty of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He organizes this bogus spiritual </v>

32
00:02:11.461 --> 00:02:14.880
<v Speaker 2>journey to process his father's death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now a year past,</v>

33
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.983
<v Speaker 2>he thinks maybe that if he can't connect</v>
<v Speaker 2>his brothers through discovering some </v>

34
00:02:19.051 --> 00:02:22.920
<v Speaker 2>deep profundity in India,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the tragedy will be senseless.</v>

35
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.130
<v Speaker 2>After all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're told that pain makes us stronger,</v>

36
00:02:26.131 --> 00:02:28.800
<v Speaker 2>that it has lessons to teach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if it doesn't?</v>

37
00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.203
<v Speaker 2>He's so desperate for connection that he</v>
<v Speaker 2>spends the entire movie literalized in </v>

38
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.340
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the form of an agreement,</v>

39
00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.290
<v Speaker 2>make an agreement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's make another agreement.</v>

40
00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.600
<v Speaker 2>Let's make another agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's make another agreement.</v>

41
00:02:39.601 --> 00:02:43.110
<v Speaker 2>We agreed to that and you agree to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We read to that can we agree to agree to</v>

42
00:02:43.111 --> 00:02:43.944
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jack and Peter Process the grief in </v>

43
00:02:45.781 --> 00:02:46.614
<v Speaker 2>their own ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jack writes a short story about the </v>

44
00:02:48.511 --> 00:02:50.700
<v Speaker 2>funeral and he's also grieving by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

45
00:02:50.701 --> 00:02:51.534
<v Speaker 2>the end of a romantic relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that's detailed in a really </v>

46
00:02:54.391 --> 00:02:58.020
<v Speaker 2>great short film that Precedes </v>
<v Speaker 2>Darjeeling called Hotel Shivali aid with</v>

47
00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.913
<v Speaker 2>Natalie Portman.</v>

48
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.093
<v Speaker 2>The brothers seemed to think that his </v>
<v Speaker 2>solution to everything is to run away </v>

49
00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.063
<v Speaker 2>from keeping his passport,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's that little gift from his ex </v>

50
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.680
<v Speaker 2>shows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Grief is like a scent.</v>

51
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.390
<v Speaker 2>It lingers and has a deep link with </v>
<v Speaker 2>memory runaway and it'll follow you.</v>

52
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.780
<v Speaker 2>Try to destroy it and you'll only </v>
<v Speaker 2>unleash the aroma in a more potent form.</v>

53
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:20.470
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Peter,</v>

54
00:03:20.471 --> 00:03:21.304
<v Speaker 2>I think who takes the tragedy hardest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not only is he the angriest of the </v>

55
00:03:24.341 --> 00:03:25.174
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but his entire life has become </v>

56
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.273
<v Speaker 2>distorted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His caring wife is weeks away from </v>

57
00:03:28.961 --> 00:03:31.750
<v Speaker 2>having their first child and he's in </v>
<v Speaker 2>India.</v>

58
00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.190
<v Speaker 2>He appropriates his father's belongings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>namely his prescription sunglasses which</v>

59
00:03:36.191 --> 00:03:39.180
<v Speaker 2>make the world unfocused in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tenenbaums.</v>

60
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.053
<v Speaker 2>Richie hides behind giant sunglasses so </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the world can't see him in </v>

61
00:03:43.451 --> 00:03:44.284
<v Speaker 2>darjeeling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jack wears prescription sunglasses so </v>

62
00:03:46.481 --> 00:03:47.314
<v Speaker 2>that he can't see the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that communication has been at </v>

63
00:03:50.831 --> 00:03:53.050
<v Speaker 2>the heart of West Anderson style from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the start.</v>

64
00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.273
<v Speaker 2>It might be that he has similar </v>
<v Speaker 2>anxieties to Francis and need to ensure </v>

65
00:03:57.551 --> 00:03:58.384
<v Speaker 2>that a message given has been received.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is one way to read all his 90 and </v>

66
00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.143
<v Speaker 2>180 degree quick pants in the same way </v>
<v Speaker 2>that Francis asks for an agreement for </v>

67
00:04:06.731 --> 00:04:07.564
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anderson takes the coolest chava effect </v>

68
00:04:09.611 --> 00:04:13.510
<v Speaker 2>where viewers derive meaning from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship between two shots perfected</v>

69
00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:14.663
<v Speaker 2>I hitchcock and fills in all the missing</v>
<v Speaker 2>information showing how those two or </v>

70
00:04:18.791 --> 00:04:21.580
<v Speaker 2>three or four compositions are </v>
<v Speaker 2>connected.</v>

71
00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:22.443
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>West Anderson loves to match personal </v>

72
00:04:24.191 --> 00:04:25.024
<v Speaker 2>crises with visual motifs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he doesn't shy away from obvious </v>

73
00:04:28.331 --> 00:04:31.810
<v Speaker 2>ones either like brothers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unwilling to feel real trauma,</v>

74
00:04:31.811 --> 00:04:36.340
<v Speaker 2>all having some form of painkiller </v>
<v Speaker 2>symbols of failed communication can come</v>

75
00:04:36.341 --> 00:04:37.174
<v Speaker 2>in the form of a dropped bag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A command shouted that no one in </v>

76
00:04:40.301 --> 00:04:43.660
<v Speaker 2>particular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a soft whisper before sex,</v>

77
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.870
<v Speaker 2>a sense of moving forward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not getting anywhere.</v>

78
00:04:46.871 --> 00:04:50.110
<v Speaker 2>It can be a train that gets lost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lost sunrail.</v>

79
00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:54.010
<v Speaker 2>Jack's tendency to turn his life into </v>
<v Speaker 2>the perfect fiction can be made physical</v>

80
00:04:54.011 --> 00:04:54.844
<v Speaker 2>in the form of an ipod.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Speaker in this too is likely a </v>

81
00:04:57.071 --> 00:04:59.830
<v Speaker 2>personality trait that Anderson shares.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

82
00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:02.770
<v Speaker 2>how is this any different from this?</v>

83
00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't necessarily think the darjeeling</v>
<v Speaker 2>limited is the formal peak of Anderson's</v>

84
00:05:17.661 --> 00:05:18.494
<v Speaker 2>work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that it's the most human of </v>

85
00:05:20.481 --> 00:05:21.314
<v Speaker 2>his films.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Since the ensemble is limited mostly to </v>

86
00:05:23.451 --> 00:05:24.284
<v Speaker 2>three people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we get a deeper dive into each </v>

87
00:05:26.241 --> 00:05:30.110
<v Speaker 2>personality and much more importantly </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the web that makes them,</v>

88
00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:34.610
<v Speaker 2>in many ways a single organism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of my favorite things about the film</v>

89
00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:39.110
<v Speaker 2>and not so obvious visual flourish is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the design of the train compartment,</v>

90
00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:44.180
<v Speaker 2>namely these two equally sized panels on</v>
<v Speaker 2>both sides of the interior wall.</v>

91
00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.660
<v Speaker 2>One is a mirror and the other is an </v>
<v Speaker 2>internal window,</v>

92
00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.660
<v Speaker 2>but of course it's hard to tell those </v>
<v Speaker 2>two things apart.</v>

93
00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:51.733
<v Speaker 2>Francis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jack and Peter are constantly throwing </v>

94
00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:54.613
<v Speaker 2>barbs at one another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling out the contours of own </v>

95
00:05:57.291 --> 00:06:00.050
<v Speaker 2>identities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes they hit the target.</v>

96
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.810
<v Speaker 2>Other times it's reflected back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mostly.</v>

97
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.033
<v Speaker 2>It's both.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess that's the point about </v>

98
00:06:05.841 --> 00:06:09.980
<v Speaker 2>communication.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't help speaking to yourself when</v>

99
00:06:09.981 --> 00:06:10.814
<v Speaker 2>you speak to others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Others can't help hearing something </v>

100
00:06:13.431 --> 00:06:17.730
<v Speaker 2>about themselves even when they know </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're projecting onto them.</v>

101
00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:19.250
<v Speaker 1>Strange.</v>

102
00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:28.570
<v Speaker 2>The Darjeeling limited is my favorite </v>
<v Speaker 2>wes Anderson movie.</v>

103
00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:29.423
<v Speaker 2>It came out when I was just starting </v>
<v Speaker 2>college trying to find my identity in </v>

104
00:06:33.001 --> 00:06:36.060
<v Speaker 2>others and it hit me square in the face </v>
<v Speaker 2>and yeah,</v>

105
00:06:36.061 --> 00:06:39.330
<v Speaker 2>I do think it's the best for now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not definitive.</v>

106
00:06:39.331 --> 00:06:40.164
<v Speaker 2>It's just the opening salvo in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation between me and everybody </v>

107
00:06:43.951 --> 00:06:46.680
<v Speaker 2>who watches this channel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A bunch of film Geeks,</v>

108
00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:49.020
<v Speaker 2>so what do you think?</v>

109
00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:56.300
<v Speaker 2>Hey everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thanks for watching.</v>

110
00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:58.790
<v Speaker 2>I had been waiting for ever to do a </v>
<v Speaker 2>video on West Anderson.</v>

111
00:06:58.791 --> 00:06:59.624
<v Speaker 2>This was so much fun and me and my </v>
<v Speaker 2>friends really do have these </v>

112
00:07:01.311 --> 00:07:04.850
<v Speaker 2>conversations all the time about which </v>
<v Speaker 2>we think is the best and I love all.</v>

113
00:07:04.851 --> 00:07:08.020
<v Speaker 2>I love moonrise kingdom and I love life </v>
<v Speaker 2>aquatic and,</v>

114
00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:09.820
<v Speaker 2>and they're also good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

115
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:10.663
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's got their favorite for one </v>
