1
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:03.180
<v Speaker 1>Coffee on a Tuesday and block 36,</v>

2
00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:16.270
<v Speaker 1>so living in New York City for a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>months now.</v>

3
00:00:16.271 --> 00:00:20.320
<v Speaker 1>I've noticed that a lot of the shops and</v>
<v Speaker 1>restaurants are cash now.</v>

4
00:00:20.321 --> 00:00:23.680
<v Speaker 1>This is generally pretty annoying since,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I imagine a lot of you out there like</v>

5
00:00:23.681 --> 00:00:27.720
<v Speaker 1>me and I've gotten pretty used to paying</v>
<v Speaker 1>for things with credit or debit card.</v>

6
00:00:27.721 --> 00:00:28.554
<v Speaker 1>So the question is why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do so many establishments only </v>

7
00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.170
<v Speaker 1>accept cash?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the incentive for them to be cash</v>

8
00:00:35.171 --> 00:00:36.004
<v Speaker 1>only in June,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say you're buying a $2 cup of </v>

9
00:00:37.751 --> 00:00:38.351
<v Speaker 1>coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

10
00:00:38.351 --> 00:00:39.184
<v Speaker 1>so you hand over your credit card to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Barista who swipes it in her credit </v>

11
00:00:42.011 --> 00:00:42.460
<v Speaker 1>card.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump,</v>

12
00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.500
<v Speaker 1>you know you've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've seen what those things look like.</v>

13
00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:45.423
<v Speaker 1>That thing reads the magnetic strip on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the back of the card and sends the </v>

14
00:00:48.791 --> 00:00:49.624
<v Speaker 1>transaction to the acquiring bank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Acquiring Bank pays the coffee shop $2 </v>

15
00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.740
<v Speaker 1>and the acquiring bank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's their $2 from an issuing bank.</v>

16
00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.450
<v Speaker 1>Think Citibank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wells Fargo,</v>

17
00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:59.313
<v Speaker 1>Bank of America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which in turn takes the money from your </v>

18
00:01:01.031 --> 00:01:01.864
<v Speaker 1>account.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This relationship between the coffee </v>

19
00:01:02.891 --> 00:01:05.650
<v Speaker 1>shop and the acquiring bank is called a </v>
<v Speaker 1>merchant account.</v>

20
00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:06.543
<v Speaker 1>When the coffee shop opened up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to get one of those fancy </v>

21
00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.390
<v Speaker 1>credit card terminals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it had to set up a merchant account with</v>

22
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.810
<v Speaker 1>an acquiring bank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it could take your plastic.</v>

23
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:14.673
<v Speaker 1>Are you with me so far about merchant </v>
<v Speaker 1>accounts work and a lot of different </v>

24
00:01:17.081 --> 00:01:17.914
<v Speaker 1>ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all of them are going to impose a </v>

25
00:01:19.151 --> 00:01:22.260
<v Speaker 1>certain number of fees on our little </v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee shop.</v>

26
00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.550
<v Speaker 1>Some of those feeds come from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>acquiring bank,</v>

27
00:01:24.551 --> 00:01:25.384
<v Speaker 1>but most are coming up through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>system from the issuing bank set by the </v>

28
00:01:29.561 --> 00:01:31.000
<v Speaker 1>credit card companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mastercard,</v>

29
00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.811
<v Speaker 1>visa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>discover,</v>

30
00:01:31.811 --> 00:01:32.644
<v Speaker 1>so when our coffee shops swipes your </v>
<v Speaker 1>card and for every other card and </v>

31
00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:36.094
<v Speaker 1>swipes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the issuing bank is going to charge a </v>

32
00:01:37.571 --> 00:01:39.610
<v Speaker 1>small interchange fee.</v>

33
00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:40.443
<v Speaker 1>Most commonly these fees are set up into</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's called a three tier pricing </v>

34
00:01:43.151 --> 00:01:43.900
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

35
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.470
<v Speaker 1>a normal swipe of the card,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's going to be first tier and you'll</v>

36
00:01:47.471 --> 00:01:48.304
<v Speaker 1>take the smallest charge of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably about one point two percent of </v>

37
00:01:50.711 --> 00:01:52.510
<v Speaker 1>the cost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fees don't end.</v>

38
00:01:52.511 --> 00:01:54.430
<v Speaker 1>Their car doesn't get accepted the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

39
00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.350
<v Speaker 1>That's a nuisance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every swipe,</v>

40
00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.450
<v Speaker 1>no matter what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's going to the issuing bank,</v>

41
00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:59.553
<v Speaker 1>that's an authorization thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the end of every month you have a </v>

42
00:02:01.861 --> 00:02:04.150
<v Speaker 1>statement that didn't pay enough and </v>
<v Speaker 1>these that.</v>

43
00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.040
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll just add a little bit more to make</v>

44
00:02:06.041 --> 00:02:09.310
<v Speaker 1>sure you hit your monthly minimum things</v>
<v Speaker 1>settling out all your days.</v>

45
00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.210
<v Speaker 1>Purchases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

46
00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:11.043
<v Speaker 1>that's a batch we need to use customer </v>
<v Speaker 1>service to figure out what the hell is </v>

47
00:02:13.451 --> 00:02:16.630
<v Speaker 1>going on with all these fees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Customer service fee.</v>

48
00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.340
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you've had enough.</v>

49
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.233
<v Speaker 1>You're sick and tired of the fees you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want out of this credit card thing for </v>

50
00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.200
<v Speaker 1>early termination fee.</v>

51
00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:25.463
<v Speaker 1>Sorry to be sure there are good reasons </v>
<v Speaker 1>for charging our little coffee shop </v>

52
00:02:28.451 --> 00:02:29.284
<v Speaker 1>rates and fees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is such a thing as transaction </v>

53
00:02:31.211 --> 00:02:32.740
<v Speaker 1>costs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as you can probably guess,</v>

54
00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:33.783
<v Speaker 1>there are serious abuses as what an </v>
<v Speaker 1>enormous antitrust lawsuit which was </v>

55
00:02:37.061 --> 00:02:37.894
<v Speaker 1>filed by 7 million merchants in 2005 was</v>
<v Speaker 1>settled earlier this year in which the </v>

56
00:02:42.521 --> 00:02:47.020
<v Speaker 1>car companies paid out seven point </v>
<v Speaker 1>$3,000,000,000</v>

57
00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.123
<v Speaker 1>with a beat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The accusation was that credit card </v>

58
00:02:49.301 --> 00:02:50.134
<v Speaker 1>companies had colluded with banks to </v>
<v Speaker 1>engage in anti competitive activities </v>

59
00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.943
<v Speaker 1>which allowed them to raise fees higher </v>
<v Speaker 1>than normal on credit card purchases </v>

60
00:02:57.191 --> 00:02:58.024
<v Speaker 1>without letting the little coffee shops </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the world raise their prices to </v>

61
00:03:00.851 --> 00:03:02.380
<v Speaker 1>accommodate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In addition to the payout,</v>

62
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.233
<v Speaker 1>the lawsuit changed just that it allows </v>
<v Speaker 1>merchants to raise their prices to </v>

63
00:03:06.851 --> 00:03:07.684
<v Speaker 1>accommodate credit card fees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thinking was that if they could do </v>

64
00:03:10.391 --> 00:03:12.640
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make a dissuade people from using credit</v>

65
00:03:12.641 --> 00:03:13.474
<v Speaker 1>cards and the credit card companies will</v>
<v Speaker 1>be forced to bring the transaction fees </v>

66
00:03:17.291 --> 00:03:18.124
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with a whopping 68 percent of all </v>

67
00:03:20.621 --> 00:03:24.130
<v Speaker 1>credit card purchases coming from visa </v>
<v Speaker 1>and mastercard,</v>

68
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:25.323
<v Speaker 1>that may be a pipe dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you can understand why a lot of </v>

69
00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:29.530
<v Speaker 1>small businesses don't accept credit </v>
<v Speaker 1>cards.</v>

70
00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.310
<v Speaker 1>They can't afford it and they have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>hope that people like me will go out and</v>

71
00:03:33.311 --> 00:03:34.144
<v Speaker 1>get the cash instead of going somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 1>else like starbucks who can handle the </v>

72
00:03:37.811 --> 00:03:40.450
<v Speaker 1>feets and I would do it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get real money.</v>

73
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.160
<v Speaker 1>The problem is that the ATM next door to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the coffee shop,</v>

74
00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:48.460
<v Speaker 1>it charges me 2:50</v>
<v Speaker 1>to take out cash.</v>

75
00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.480
<v Speaker 1>Fifty two books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>52 weeks.</v>

76
00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.530
<v Speaker 1>Fifty two books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you weeks?</v>

77
00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:58.473
<v Speaker 1>If you follow me on Tumbler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will feel bad about not reading the </v>

78
00:04:01.841 --> 00:04:02.674
<v Speaker 1>books if I don't read them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's why you should follow me </v>

79
00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.380
<v Speaker 1>because you are the ones that are gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Help me finish all these books.</v>

80
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.110
<v Speaker 1>Support small business.</v>
