00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:13.890
<v Speaker 1>Coffee on a Tuesday and blog 21.</v>

2
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.900
<v Speaker 1>So I have this thing about bookstores </v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever I walked by them.</v>

3
00:00:27.901 --> 00:00:28.734
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know how in Vegas they pump scented </v>

4
00:00:30.601 --> 00:00:32.910
<v Speaker 1>air through the casinos to make the </v>
<v Speaker 1>gamblers feel good.</v>

5
00:00:32.911 --> 00:00:34.200
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever I walked by a bookstore,</v>

6
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.213
<v Speaker 1>I get the smell of books in my face and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I just have to go in and I could spend </v>

7
00:00:38.551 --> 00:00:39.384
<v Speaker 1>all day in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason I usually leave is because I </v>

8
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.243
<v Speaker 1>start to get light headed and realize </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I'd miss lunch and it's coming up </v>

9
00:00:43.921 --> 00:00:44.754
<v Speaker 1>on dinner and people are expecting me </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I have to do this thing and write </v>

10
00:00:47.101 --> 00:00:47.934
<v Speaker 1>that email and move on with my day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe it's not smart for one to </v>

11
00:00:52.891 --> 00:00:55.170
<v Speaker 1>analyze the charm of bookstores.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>

12
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.513
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've already sort of started it and </v>

13
00:00:57.061 --> 00:00:57.894
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read this article in the Times </v>

14
00:00:58.561 --> 00:01:00.300
<v Speaker 1>yesterday and and it's got me thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

15
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.133
<v Speaker 1>See the article said that Barnes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>noble has predicted that in the coming </v>

16
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.960
<v Speaker 1>year it will lose more money than even </v>
<v Speaker 1>Wall Street had predicted it would.</v>

17
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.000
<v Speaker 1>And this after the bankruptcy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>disillusion of borders,</v>

18
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:12.983
<v Speaker 1>its main competitor is the specter of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ebooks with Amazon and it's kindle as a </v>

19
00:01:17.041 --> 00:01:19.380
<v Speaker 1>dominant force,</v>
<v Speaker 1>threatens to diminish this,</v>

20
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.260
<v Speaker 1>this last chain of booksellers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if they do,</v>

21
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.273
<v Speaker 1>you might be left buying your your best </v>
<v Speaker 1>sellers at places like target or </v>

22
00:01:26.611 --> 00:01:27.444
<v Speaker 1>Walmart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's ironic because it was barnes </v>

23
00:01:29.251 --> 00:01:30.084
<v Speaker 1>and noble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which drove so many independent </v>

24
00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:32.493
<v Speaker 1>booksellers to bankruptcy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of like what Tom Hanks does to Meg </v>

25
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.090
<v Speaker 1>Ryan and you've got mail</v>

26
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.150
<v Speaker 2>with his multilevel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>homogenize the world Mochaccino land.</v>

27
00:01:40.151 --> 00:01:40.380
<v Speaker 2>Now</v>

28
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.730
<v Speaker 1>mochaccino land might be the last best </v>
<v Speaker 1>hope for print books and publishers like</v>

29
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:45.593
<v Speaker 1>penguin and Random House and Simon and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Schuster who used that front of the </v>

30
00:01:48.211 --> 00:01:49.044
<v Speaker 1>store display table to premier new </v>
<v Speaker 1>talent to push the next big thing at </v>

31
00:01:51.941 --> 00:01:52.774
<v Speaker 1>table,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is especially important for new </v>

32
00:01:53.701 --> 00:01:57.480
<v Speaker 1>writers like me now to fight off the </v>
<v Speaker 1>kindle.</v>

33
00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:58.403
<v Speaker 1>Barnes and noble has the nook and it has</v>
<v Speaker 1>boosted some revenue to the company </v>

34
00:02:01.021 --> 00:02:04.740
<v Speaker 1>though it's hard to fight off both </v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazon and apple at the same time.</v>

35
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.920
<v Speaker 1>David had enough trouble fighting just </v>
<v Speaker 1>the one goliath.</v>

36
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.830
<v Speaker 1>William Lynch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the new CEO of Barnes and noble has done</v>

37
00:02:10.831 --> 00:02:13.380
<v Speaker 1>everything he possibly can to stay </v>
<v Speaker 1>relevant and ahead of the curve,</v>

38
00:02:13.381 --> 00:02:14.214
<v Speaker 1>but his company is worth this much while</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazon's is worth this much and I guess </v>

39
00:02:18.721 --> 00:02:19.554
<v Speaker 1>we'll see how it plays out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I pause to wonder if there is </v>

40
00:02:23.131 --> 00:02:26.940
<v Speaker 1>something lost by the digitizing of </v>
<v Speaker 1>books in the possible end of bookstores.</v>

41
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.253
<v Speaker 1>It's safe to say that someone reading a </v>
<v Speaker 1>book on their kindle or Nook is having </v>

42
00:02:30.121 --> 00:02:32.760
<v Speaker 1>an experience which is negligibly </v>
<v Speaker 1>different from reading a paper book.</v>

43
00:02:32.761 --> 00:02:33.594
<v Speaker 1>The story is still there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The words arrange as they are still </v>

44
00:02:35.701 --> 00:02:36.840
<v Speaker 1>produced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same magic,</v>

45
00:02:36.841 --> 00:02:41.640
<v Speaker 1>the same music of mental images that </v>
<v Speaker 1>only pros can make that won't be lost.</v>

46
00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.150
<v Speaker 1>I guess what I fear is not the death of </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories,</v>

47
00:02:45.151 --> 00:02:48.030
<v Speaker 1>but rather the end of the physical </v>
<v Speaker 1>space,</v>

48
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:49.613
<v Speaker 1>which those stories take up walking </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the stacks and shelves of the </v>

49
00:02:52.411 --> 00:02:55.830
<v Speaker 1>bookstore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All our past and present knowledge looms</v>

50
00:02:55.831 --> 00:02:56.664
<v Speaker 1>cast shadows on you and maybe you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>more accurate of sense with all that </v>

51
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.560
<v Speaker 1>papered space of the distance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've come as a thinking rice.</v>

52
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.080
<v Speaker 1>It's like a real living interactive </v>
<v Speaker 1>timeline.</v>

53
00:03:05.081 --> 00:03:07.750
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same with a selection of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ebooks on your ipad.</v>

54
00:03:07.751 --> 00:03:09.550
<v Speaker 1>It's no space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just scrolling.</v>

55
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.193
<v Speaker 1>You can't see each and every page tight </v>
<v Speaker 1>against the next and you can't see the </v>

56
00:03:14.351 --> 00:03:15.184
<v Speaker 1>overstock or the display table or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>books people have taken out of their </v>

57
00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:19.834
<v Speaker 1>shells but decided not to buy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a million variables in the </v>

58
00:03:22.691 --> 00:03:25.600
<v Speaker 1>bookstore variable stretched over space </v>
<v Speaker 1>and time,</v>

59
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.900
<v Speaker 1>and it's true that sometimes a book like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a magic rain can find you</v>

60
00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.320
<v Speaker 1>and maybe there's an alchemy in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would be a shame to lose.</v>

61
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.000
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe I'm just being sentimental.</v>

62
00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.490
<v Speaker 3>The amount Susanna.</v>
