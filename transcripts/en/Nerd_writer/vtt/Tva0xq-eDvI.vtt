1
00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:06.363
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're about to experience is </v>

2
00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:08.703
<v Speaker 1>shocking for them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a German term for taking pleasure in </v>

3
00:00:11.021 --> 00:00:13.780
<v Speaker 1>someone else's misfortune.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's back up a bit.</v>

4
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.860
<v Speaker 1>There's a cottage industry around </v>
<v Speaker 1>shopping online.</v>

5
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.830
<v Speaker 1>It's why fail videos get tens of </v>
<v Speaker 1>millions of views,</v>

6
00:00:25.831 --> 00:00:27.690
<v Speaker 1>and it's why there's so much fun to </v>
<v Speaker 1>watch.</v>

7
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:28.763
<v Speaker 1>Fail compilations are an evolution of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things like jackass and the America's </v>

8
00:00:32.341 --> 00:00:33.174
<v Speaker 1>funniest home video format,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really just a nonfiction </v>

9
00:00:35.461 --> 00:00:36.294
<v Speaker 1>version of the slapstick comedy that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>see in the three stooges or Charlie </v>

10
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.440
<v Speaker 1>Chaplin movies where Shakespeare's </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedies going all the way back probably</v>

11
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.070
<v Speaker 1>to the origin of laughter itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do we feel this way?</v>

12
00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.053
<v Speaker 1>What makes us enjoy the pain of others?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It comes down to identity and self </v>

13
00:00:52.471 --> 00:00:53.304
<v Speaker 1>esteem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Human society is defined by competition </v>

14
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.160
<v Speaker 1>and comparison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you see someone fail,</v>

15
00:00:58.161 --> 00:01:00.580
<v Speaker 1>your psyche is rewarded with a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>boost.</v>

16
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.200
<v Speaker 1>The feeling that you're better off than </v>
<v Speaker 1>they are shopping for to is particularly</v>

17
00:01:04.201 --> 00:01:05.034
<v Speaker 1>strong wind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The failure in question is arrogant or </v>

18
00:01:06.841 --> 00:01:07.674
<v Speaker 1>deserving or even just to successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why we delight when celebrities </v>

19
00:01:11.401 --> 00:01:12.390
<v Speaker 1>fall from grace.</v>

20
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:13.523
<v Speaker 1>It's why the downfall of super high </v>
<v Speaker 1>achievers like tiger woods generates so </v>

21
00:01:16.441 --> 00:01:21.030
<v Speaker 1>much media attention in societies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These feelings extend to our groups.</v>

22
00:01:21.031 --> 00:01:25.200
<v Speaker 1>The more we identify with our Ingroup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like our favorite sports team,</v>

23
00:01:25.201 --> 00:01:26.034
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more susceptible we are to shot in </v>

24
00:01:27.581 --> 00:01:29.970
<v Speaker 1>Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When a rival team loses.</v>

25
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.110
<v Speaker 1>Now in the realm of sports and people </v>
<v Speaker 1>falling off,</v>

26
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.000
<v Speaker 1>rope swings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feelings of shot and Florida are natural</v>

27
00:01:36.001 --> 00:01:38.820
<v Speaker 1>and innocent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Self esteem is not a steady thing.</v>

28
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.970
<v Speaker 1>Fluctuates and if it fail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>compilation makes you laugh.</v>

29
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.400
<v Speaker 1>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Were shot in Florida,</v>

30
00:01:44.401 --> 00:01:48.090
<v Speaker 1>I think becomes poisonous is in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe of politics.</v>

31
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.373
<v Speaker 1>I mean if Shoutin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Florida is a feature of ingroups and </v>

32
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.360
<v Speaker 1>outgroups in competition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it should be no surprise that it festers</v>

33
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.373
<v Speaker 1>in our political parties where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>victory of one side almost always means </v>

34
00:01:58.681 --> 00:02:00.970
<v Speaker 1>a defeat of the other and studies on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Shoutin,</v>

35
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.580
<v Speaker 1>Florida in politics bear this out.</v>

36
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:03.443
<v Speaker 1>Intensity of party affiliation strongly </v>
<v Speaker 1>predicts whether events produce shot in </v>

37
00:02:07.291 --> 00:02:08.124
<v Speaker 1>Florida in their members when the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Republican party missteps or one of its </v>

38
00:02:11.161 --> 00:02:11.994
<v Speaker 1>members commits a gaffe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Democrats report feelings of shopping </v>

39
00:02:14.371 --> 00:02:17.970
<v Speaker 1>for them and vice versa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What complicates things is that politics</v>

40
00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:21.330
<v Speaker 1>involves the wellbeing and the suffering</v>
<v Speaker 1>of millions of people.</v>

41
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.590
<v Speaker 1>The failure of your opponent group can </v>
<v Speaker 1>often spell objectively bad consequences</v>

42
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.453
<v Speaker 1>for everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet the most disturbing finding of </v>

43
00:02:28.441 --> 00:02:32.160
<v Speaker 1>studies on Shodan 40 to in politics is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that even in these cases,</v>

44
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.240
<v Speaker 1>people report shouting for that as long </v>
<v Speaker 1>as their opponents lose out.</v>

45
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.313
<v Speaker 1>Scary as that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can take solace in the fact that </v>

46
00:02:39.151 --> 00:02:42.990
<v Speaker 1>most people understand that these </v>
<v Speaker 1>feelings are socially inappropriate,</v>

47
00:02:42.991 --> 00:02:46.020
<v Speaker 1>which is why they're felt that not </v>
<v Speaker 1>really spoken about studies.</v>

48
00:02:46.021 --> 00:02:46.854
<v Speaker 1>Bear this out to those who report </v>
<v Speaker 1>feelings of Shodan for at objectively </v>

49
00:02:49.921 --> 00:02:50.754
<v Speaker 1>bad news like an economic downturn </v>
<v Speaker 1>hurting the opposing party are also </v>

50
00:02:54.511 --> 00:02:59.500
<v Speaker 1>deeply ambivalent about just having that</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion or at least they to be.</v>

51
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.330
<v Speaker 1>All I did is point out the fact that on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the cover of the national enquirer,</v>

52
00:03:04.331 --> 00:03:09.331
<v Speaker 1>there's a picture of him and crazy Lee </v>
<v Speaker 1>Harvey Oswald having breakfast now.</v>

53
00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.850
<v Speaker 1>10 never denied that it was his father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that troubled me about</v>

54
00:03:15.851 --> 00:03:16.684
<v Speaker 1>the 2016 election was the presence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Shodan Freida among Democrats and </v>

55
00:03:20.381 --> 00:03:23.800
<v Speaker 1>opponents of Donald Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He seemed to free people up somehow,</v>

56
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:24.693
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's because ambivalence </v>
<v Speaker 1>about shotgun Florida in politics is a </v>

57
00:03:27.731 --> 00:03:28.564
<v Speaker 1>result of the fact that on some level we</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe our opponent group is genuinely </v>

58
00:03:32.621 --> 00:03:35.110
<v Speaker 1>trying to help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're just going about it the wrong way.</v>

59
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.750
<v Speaker 1>Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the other hand is so cartoonish,</v>

60
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:38.673
<v Speaker 1>so nakedly selfserving that any </v>
<v Speaker 1>reservations people might have about </v>

61
00:03:41.831 --> 00:03:42.664
<v Speaker 1>basking in his blunders just evaporated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald trump is the perfect figure for </v>

62
00:03:46.721 --> 00:03:49.720
<v Speaker 1>Shotgun Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He checks every box arrogant,</v>

63
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.430
<v Speaker 1>successful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deserving.</v>

64
00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.310
<v Speaker 1>What's more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he openly participates in it himself.</v>

65
00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:57.850
<v Speaker 1>It's Rubio,</v>

66
00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:59.643
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

67
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:04.480
<v Speaker 1>I offered the opportunity for guilt free</v>
<v Speaker 1>shot in Florida,</v>

68
00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.620
<v Speaker 1>and this is what troubles me because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was natural for trump supporters to take</v>

69
00:04:08.621 --> 00:04:09.454
<v Speaker 1>pleasure in his candidacy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I saw all around me was his </v>

70
00:04:12.251 --> 00:04:15.340
<v Speaker 1>opponents feeling the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For many,</v>

71
00:04:15.341 --> 00:04:18.970
<v Speaker 1>it was just as enjoyable as watching a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fail compilation video.</v>

72
00:04:18.971 --> 00:04:19.804
<v Speaker 1>Seeing him make appalling comment after </v>
<v Speaker 1>appalling common at the start when he </v>

73
00:04:23.591 --> 00:04:24.424
<v Speaker 1>was a joke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there seemed to be a little harm and </v>

74
00:04:25.841 --> 00:04:30.790
<v Speaker 1>expressing the shotgun Florida,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was an effect because the news</v>

75
00:04:30.791 --> 00:04:31.624
<v Speaker 1>media registered this feeling as </v>
<v Speaker 1>interest and as a result gave an </v>

76
00:04:35.381 --> 00:04:38.650
<v Speaker 1>enormously lopsided amount of media </v>
<v Speaker 1>coverage to his campaign,</v>

77
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:39.783
<v Speaker 1>which may trump the focus of everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It may be the first time in US history </v>

78
00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.890
<v Speaker 1>that collective shoutin Florida </v>
<v Speaker 1>influenced a political outcome,</v>

79
00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:49.293
<v Speaker 1>and that's not a joke at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right now we're living through an </v>

80
00:04:51.671 --> 00:04:54.640
<v Speaker 1>intoxicating mixture of entertainment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>politics,</v>

81
00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:56.560
<v Speaker 1>journalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and shot in Florida.</v>

82
00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.910
<v Speaker 1>It's a mixture that is unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 1>great for the news media and as trump is</v>

83
00:05:00.911 --> 00:05:04.930
<v Speaker 1>embroiled in the Russia investigation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the news media is showing its best side,</v>

84
00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.720
<v Speaker 1>but it's worth site two with each new </v>
<v Speaker 1>revelation,</v>

85
00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.290
<v Speaker 1>each new bombshell report the Shazam for</v>
<v Speaker 1>you to become stronger,</v>

86
00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.250
<v Speaker 1>and that incentive is impossible for </v>
<v Speaker 1>media executives to resist.</v>

87
00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:16.743
<v Speaker 1>If trump goes down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll be met with alation from certain </v>

88
00:05:18.941 --> 00:05:21.700
<v Speaker 1>sectors of the public and who knows he </v>
<v Speaker 1>may deserve it,</v>

89
00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.830
<v Speaker 1>but whatever happens with his presidency</v>
<v Speaker 1>shot in Freud,</v>

90
00:05:24.831 --> 00:05:29.140
<v Speaker 1>it is a drug that we ought to keep in </v>
<v Speaker 1>check because like any drug,</v>

91
00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:30.063
<v Speaker 1>a growing tolerance will eventually mean</v>
<v Speaker 1>a growing desire for more of it more </v>

92
00:05:34.091 --> 00:05:34.924
<v Speaker 1>often,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's not a force we want power in </v>

93
00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:38.043
<v Speaker 1>our politics.</v>

94

<v Speaker 1>chest.</v>
