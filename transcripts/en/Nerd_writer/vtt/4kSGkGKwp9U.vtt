1
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:02.873
<v Speaker 1>Much like game of thrones before it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hbo Westworld is an elaborate at big </v>

2
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.153
<v Speaker 1>puzzle box of a production that serves </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the end as an excuse to explore </v>

3
00:00:11.551 --> 00:00:15.270
<v Speaker 1>something much smaller and much more </v>
<v Speaker 1>important character.</v>

4
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:16.343
<v Speaker 1>This is why despite the sweeping vistas </v>
<v Speaker 1>what holds everything else up or the </v>

5
00:00:20.011 --> 00:00:20.844
<v Speaker 1>conversations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how they're written and how they're </v>

6
00:00:22.711 --> 00:00:23.544
<v Speaker 1>acted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and today I want to take a look at one </v>

7
00:00:24.961 --> 00:00:27.180
<v Speaker 1>conversation featuring the Great Anthony</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hopkins.</v>

8
00:00:27.181 --> 00:00:28.014
<v Speaker 1>Specifically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to examine how hopkins acts the </v>

9
00:00:30.151 --> 00:00:30.984
<v Speaker 1>scene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how he elevates every line of dialogue </v>

10
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.500
<v Speaker 1>to a hypnotically interesting level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll imagine I've gone mad.</v>

11
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.850
<v Speaker 1>You lost my way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Simply concerned about the extent of the</v>

12
00:00:43.891 --> 00:00:47.340
<v Speaker 1>changes you're making.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to protect the legacy.</v>

13
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.740
<v Speaker 1>My legacy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

14
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:50.603
<v Speaker 1>The background of the scene is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Teresa Colon and operations manager of </v>

15
00:00:53.581 --> 00:00:54.414
<v Speaker 1>the westworld theme park is trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>stop or at least stall the creation of </v>

16
00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.680
<v Speaker 1>Robert for Anthony Hopkins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new storyline for the guests.</v>

17
00:01:01.681 --> 00:01:05.160
<v Speaker 1>The storyline that is generally wreaking</v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos on things to the point of worrying</v>

18
00:01:05.161 --> 00:01:05.994
<v Speaker 1>the parks financier's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's clear that Theresa feels that </v>

19
00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.003
<v Speaker 1>Ford's undertaking is just too risky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but instead of forthrightly telling him </v>

20
00:01:11.911 --> 00:01:16.410
<v Speaker 1>so she puts things in euphemistic terms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to protect your legacy</v>

21
00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.093
<v Speaker 2>legacy.</v>

22
00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:25.813
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that pause is fully seven seconds long </v>

23
00:01:27.471 --> 00:01:32.270
<v Speaker 1>and it is amazing after reacting in </v>
<v Speaker 1>disbelief at such a shameless euphemism,</v>

24
00:01:32.271 --> 00:01:33.104
<v Speaker 1>hopkins in silence cycles through a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions first disbelief than a </v>

25
00:01:38.841 --> 00:01:42.590
<v Speaker 1>consideration of the words for a split </v>
<v Speaker 1>second at their face value.</v>

26
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:43.633
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he should safeguard his legacy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he shouldn't be so ambitious at </v>

27
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.930
<v Speaker 1>his age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then a smile and this scene will feature</v>

28
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:51.793
<v Speaker 1>several shades of smile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This one is kind as kind as can be in </v>

29
00:01:55.191 --> 00:01:57.110
<v Speaker 1>the face of what he considers to be an </v>
<v Speaker 1>attack.</v>

30
00:01:57.111 --> 00:02:01.430
<v Speaker 1>One that insults his intelligence as he </v>
<v Speaker 1>looks down and chuckles.</v>

31
00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.910
<v Speaker 1>The smile seems to acquire some </v>
<v Speaker 1>suppressed anger.</v>

32
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.810
<v Speaker 1>You can only bear to look at her in </v>
<v Speaker 1>quick glances as he composes himself.</v>

33
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.620
<v Speaker 1>Then he fires back and antagonistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>remark.</v>

34
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.470
<v Speaker 1>You're done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this space that amounts to.</v>

35
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:17.733
<v Speaker 1>I've seen many of you come and go over </v>
<v Speaker 1>the years and I can tell the ones who </v>

36
00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.080
<v Speaker 1>enjoy the time here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones who don't.</v>

37
00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:24.483
<v Speaker 1>What's impressive here is how hopkins </v>
<v Speaker 1>breaks down the dialogue as written in </v>

38
00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:28.803
<v Speaker 1>interviews.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hopkins has described how he reads </v>

39
00:02:30.071 --> 00:02:30.904
<v Speaker 1>scripts 200 times or so to the point </v>
<v Speaker 1>where the dialogue is lodged in his </v>

40
00:02:34.541 --> 00:02:36.660
<v Speaker 1>brain that he steps away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's sit,</v>

41
00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.130
<v Speaker 1>gestate in his mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when he arrives on set,</v>

42
00:02:39.131 --> 00:02:39.964
<v Speaker 1>he relaxes himself and let the punk days</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you by having such a command over </v>

43
00:02:44.771 --> 00:02:48.340
<v Speaker 1>the words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopkins is able to modulate the tempo of</v>

44
00:02:48.341 --> 00:02:50.410
<v Speaker 1>their delivery to get the most out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

45
00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.820
<v Speaker 1>This sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

46
00:02:51.821 --> 00:02:52.654
<v Speaker 1>is spread through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen many of you come and go over </v>

47
00:02:54.551 --> 00:02:56.560
<v Speaker 1>the years and as as the first part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the next sentence,</v>

48
00:02:56.561 --> 00:03:00.100
<v Speaker 1>until a pause,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after who drawing out the word enjoy,</v>

49
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.320
<v Speaker 1>which falls right back into a speedy </v>
<v Speaker 1>delivery,</v>

50
00:03:02.321 --> 00:03:05.710
<v Speaker 1>almost slipping over the words until the</v>
<v Speaker 1>final two,</v>

51
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.280
<v Speaker 1>which coupled with icontact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slowed down to function.</v>

52
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.173
<v Speaker 1>As an accusation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen many of you come and go over </v>

53
00:03:11.501 --> 00:03:16.310
<v Speaker 1>the years and I can tell the ones who </v>
<v Speaker 1>enjoy the time on pseudo.</v>

54
00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.470
<v Speaker 1>I admire it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the audacity of it,</v>

55
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.973
<v Speaker 1>a small interjection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but see how he opens up like a flower </v>

56
00:03:26.681 --> 00:03:27.514
<v Speaker 1>from the hunched position,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how he releases a little tension to </v>

57
00:03:30.011 --> 00:03:32.140
<v Speaker 1>receive the compliment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great touch.</v>

58
00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.930
<v Speaker 1>I came there once as a child with my </v>
<v Speaker 1>parents.</v>

59
00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.910
<v Speaker 1>I think we even sat at this table when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>started working here.</v>

60
00:03:39.911 --> 00:03:40.744
<v Speaker 1>I realized this place wasn't something I</v>
<v Speaker 1>would enjoy and then we get a second </v>

61
00:03:44.861 --> 00:03:47.140
<v Speaker 1>interjection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When his suspicions are confirmed,</v>

62
00:03:47.141 --> 00:03:50.500
<v Speaker 1>followed by hunching again and at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fleeted neck.</v>

63
00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.250
<v Speaker 1>Then from this position,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hopkins launches into his key speech.</v>

64
00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.973
<v Speaker 1>In the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I imagined things would be perfectly </v>

65
00:03:59.891 --> 00:04:04.250
<v Speaker 1>balanced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even the beds with my partner Arnold,</v>

66
00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.590
<v Speaker 1>to that effect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they made 100 hopeful storylines.</v>

67
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.790
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost no one took us up on the last.</v>

68
00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:11.723
<v Speaker 1>The bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arnold always held a somewhat dim view </v>

69
00:04:16.721 --> 00:04:18.850
<v Speaker 1>of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He preferred the hosts.</v>

70
00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.230
<v Speaker 1>They begged me not to let you people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the money,</v>

71
00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.830
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell us,</v>

72
00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.963
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're about to learn that this whole </v>

73
00:04:25.841 --> 00:04:26.674
<v Speaker 1>meeting is a threat setup by Hopkins and</v>
<v Speaker 1>to signal that Hopkins incrementally </v>

74
00:04:30.551 --> 00:04:31.384
<v Speaker 1>dials up the menace across three terms </v>
<v Speaker 1>that specify who he threatening you </v>

75
00:04:35.381 --> 00:04:36.430
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>

76
00:04:36.431 --> 00:04:38.320
<v Speaker 1>men delos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen to it again.</v>

77
00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.440
<v Speaker 1>They begged me not to let you people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the money,</v>

78
00:04:41.441 --> 00:04:44.330
<v Speaker 1>men Delis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I told him,</v>

79
00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.200
<v Speaker 1>if you find that you didn't understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you are paying for,</v>

80
00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:48.813
<v Speaker 1>it's not a business venture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now seem an entire world designed every </v>

81
00:04:55.961 --> 00:04:56.794
<v Speaker 1>inch of it,</v>

82
00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.750
<v Speaker 3>every blade of grass in here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have a God's Mandy August.</v>

83
00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.823
<v Speaker 1>Watching this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first time it was here that it </v>

84
00:05:14.061 --> 00:05:18.620
<v Speaker 1>struck me how crucial Ford's personality</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to the functioning of the series.</v>

85
00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:19.663
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>westworld is in many ways a ridiculous </v>

86
00:05:21.621 --> 00:05:25.310
<v Speaker 1>idea both as a theme park and as a TV </v>
<v Speaker 1>show to work.</v>

87
00:05:25.311 --> 00:05:28.310
<v Speaker 1>The conceit had to be mapped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reflected,</v>

88
00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:33.320
<v Speaker 1>justified in the complex desires and </v>
<v Speaker 1>ambitions of its creators.</v>

89
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:37.580
<v Speaker 1>The writers have achieved that in Fort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's hopkins who really brings these</v>

90
00:05:37.581 --> 00:05:41.670
<v Speaker 1>things to light and how did that work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>For sadly,</v>

91
00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.010
<v Speaker 1>he lost his perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He went mad.</v>

92
00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.120
<v Speaker 1>I haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you well know,</v>

93
00:05:50.121 --> 00:05:55.121
<v Speaker 1>I've always seen things very clearly the</v>
<v Speaker 1>threat now,</v>

94
00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.710
<v Speaker 1>explicit hopkins colors the rest of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>scene with a sinister glean.</v>

95
00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:05.910
<v Speaker 1>This is the table I sat with my parents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know everything about our guests.</v>

96
00:06:06.741 --> 00:06:09.680
<v Speaker 1>Don't pay as we know everything about </v>
<v Speaker 1>our employees.</v>

97
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.100
<v Speaker 1>From here on out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he presses his advantage not with force,</v>

98
00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.350
<v Speaker 1>but with comfort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a smile,</v>

99
00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:18.260
<v Speaker 1>no longer needing to convince Teresa of </v>
<v Speaker 1>his dominance,</v>

100
00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:19.303
<v Speaker 1>hopkins dances and different attitudes </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a couple of seconds before falling </v>

101
00:06:22.911 --> 00:06:25.940
<v Speaker 1>back into that smile like right here </v>
<v Speaker 1>where he's.</v>

102
00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:26.773
<v Speaker 1>Matter of fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know everything about our guests </v>

103
00:06:28.461 --> 00:06:29.294
<v Speaker 1>don't pay as we know everything about </v>
<v Speaker 1>our employees or here where he's </v>

104
00:06:33.201 --> 00:06:34.034
<v Speaker 1>concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do hope he will be careful with a nod </v>

105
00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:41.850
<v Speaker 1>or here where he's genuinely caring as </v>
<v Speaker 1>his eyes wander off for a moment too.</v>

106
00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.033
<v Speaker 1>It has a sensitive disposition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The producers of the show are smart to </v>

107
00:06:49.251 --> 00:06:50.084
<v Speaker 1>keep the camera fixed on Hopkins face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His ability learned across many decades </v>

108
00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:55.933
<v Speaker 1>to convey such a web of feeling and </v>
<v Speaker 1>suggest such a universe of feeling </v>

109
00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:04.010
<v Speaker 1>within about a character we know little </v>
<v Speaker 1>about expands.</v>

110
00:07:04.011 --> 00:07:09.011
<v Speaker 1>The entire shows range and strengthens </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's persuasive power as a piece of art.</v>

111
00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:14.120
<v Speaker 1>That's what a great actor can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can give words and images or a short</v>

112
00:07:14.121 --> 00:07:19.121
<v Speaker 1>scene like this of volcanic energy with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the quiet look and Anthony Hopkins hands</v>

113
00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.980
<v Speaker 1>in his eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Westworld isn't just a reflection of its</v>

114
00:07:24.981 --> 00:07:28.160
<v Speaker 1>creators personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a self portrait.</v>

115
