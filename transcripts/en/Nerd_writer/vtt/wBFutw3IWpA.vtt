1
00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:06.660
<v Speaker 1>Universities are often cited as </v>
<v Speaker 1>mythologies of the modern era,</v>

2
00:00:06.661 --> 00:00:08.060
<v Speaker 1>Superman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spiderman,</v>

3
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:08.970
<v Speaker 1>wonder woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the hulk.</v>

4
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.210
<v Speaker 1>These are the new gods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the site and Apollo Zeus of our debt,</v>

5
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:19.050
<v Speaker 1>but the strongest similarities between </v>
<v Speaker 1>Greek myth and American comics have less</v>

6
00:00:19.051 --> 00:00:19.884
<v Speaker 1>to do with the characters or their </v>
<v Speaker 1>supernatural powers than with an ever </v>

7
00:00:24.151 --> 00:00:29.151
<v Speaker 1>growing interweaving tapestry of story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There will be very little force,</v>

8
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:30.203
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in escalas is Oresteia the story of </v>

9
00:00:32.791 --> 00:00:33.624
<v Speaker 1>arrestees revenge on his mother </v>
<v Speaker 1>Clytemnestra murder of her husband </v>

10
00:00:36.481 --> 00:00:37.314
<v Speaker 1>agamemnon arrestees father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the story of Agamemnon had not </v>

11
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:41.303
<v Speaker 1>already been told in homer's Iliad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dark family history of Agamemnon is </v>

12
00:00:45.571 --> 00:00:49.170
<v Speaker 1>assumed in escalates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His tragedy all at symbolisms of rape,</v>

13
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.370
<v Speaker 1>murder and incest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Augment the RSD is expansion of it.</v>

14
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.240
<v Speaker 1>That same idea goes for Frank Miller's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The dark knight returns,</v>

15
00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.350
<v Speaker 1>the new orange tail of a geriatric </v>
<v Speaker 1>Batman coming out of retirement.</v>

16
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:02.213
<v Speaker 1>Miller drew on what was then 48 years of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Batman stories from Bob Kane to Dennis </v>

17
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.260
<v Speaker 1>O'neil from sixties camp to seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brooding.</v>

18
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.153
<v Speaker 1>All of it informs the Dark Knight </v>
<v Speaker 1>returns introspective depiction of a </v>

19
00:01:14.281 --> 00:01:16.950
<v Speaker 1>beast at war with the man who embodies </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

20
00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:17.813
<v Speaker 1>both stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drug depth from the narrative universes </v>

21
00:01:20.041 --> 00:01:20.874
<v Speaker 1>to which they belong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more depth in either could achieve </v>

22
00:01:22.441 --> 00:01:23.274
<v Speaker 1>alone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the stories that came after use </v>

23
00:01:25.381 --> 00:01:28.950
<v Speaker 1>these in the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a unique feature of mythology.</v>

24
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.100
<v Speaker 1>Every story lends special weight to </v>
<v Speaker 1>every other.</v>

25
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.340
<v Speaker 1>Shared characters develop a life's worth</v>
<v Speaker 1>of pain,</v>

26
00:01:35.341 --> 00:01:36.510
<v Speaker 1>triumph,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety,</v>

27
00:01:36.511 --> 00:01:38.550
<v Speaker 1>affection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as the tapper street grows,</v>

28
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.240
<v Speaker 1>larger and tighter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual threads become more sensitive</v>

29
00:01:42.241 --> 00:01:43.074
<v Speaker 1>to effects on others and the whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's why we keep returning to Greek </v>

30
00:01:45.811 --> 00:01:48.570
<v Speaker 1>myth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's why we love comic books and when it</v>

31
00:01:48.571 --> 00:01:49.404
<v Speaker 1>comes to film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marvel comics understands with ironman </v>

32
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.940
<v Speaker 1>the incredible hulk captain America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first Avenger and thor marvel rolled</v>

33
00:01:56.941 --> 00:01:57.774
<v Speaker 1>out and incredible and incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful campaign to entwine it's </v>

34
00:02:01.771 --> 00:02:04.140
<v Speaker 1>heroes world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first phase,</v>

35
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.030
<v Speaker 1>as they called it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>featured origin stories.</v>

36
00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.863
<v Speaker 1>Unnecessary hurdle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Average filmgoers weren't familiar with </v>

37
00:02:09.091 --> 00:02:09.924
<v Speaker 1>thor or ironman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then with the groundwork laid in a </v>

38
00:02:12.001 --> 00:02:12.834
<v Speaker 1>number of hints that something bigger </v>
<v Speaker 1>was on the way marvel studios delivered </v>

39
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.890
<v Speaker 1>the avengers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first shared universe comic film.</v>

40
00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.070
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to overstate the impact of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this under the guidance of Sweden.</v>

41
00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.963
<v Speaker 1>The avengers came off beautifully,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the real payoff was next with iron </v>

42
00:02:29.061 --> 00:02:29.894
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three marvel released a film in which </v>

43
00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.590
<v Speaker 1>the facts of a shared universe fed back </v>
<v Speaker 1>and added special way to Tony Stark's,</v>

44
00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.890
<v Speaker 1>new life and story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something more than sql.</v>

45
00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.853
<v Speaker 1>It's something that's never been done </v>
<v Speaker 1>before and Phil compared to this DC </v>

46
00:02:44.851 --> 00:02:45.684
<v Speaker 1>comics heroes are hopelessly alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They exist awkwardly on separate film </v>

47
00:02:50.101 --> 00:02:52.080
<v Speaker 1>islands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Superman doesn't know Batman,</v>

48
00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.921
<v Speaker 1>Greenland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or does it.</v>

49
00:02:52.921 --> 00:02:55.800
<v Speaker 1>No wonder woman or Martian manhunter or </v>
<v Speaker 1>Aquaman.</v>

50
00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:56.663
<v Speaker 1>Nobody knows the flash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christopher Nolan did a superb job with </v>

51
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.170
<v Speaker 1>Batman begins and the dark night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's got them.</v>

52
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.170
<v Speaker 1>City has no sister in metropolis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every hero is the first of its kind.</v>

53
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:08.043
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully the upcoming superman versus </v>
<v Speaker 1>Batman movie is assigned that DC </v>

54
00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.610
<v Speaker 1>starting to get its act together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

55
00:03:12.611 --> 00:03:15.040
<v Speaker 1>Dave Cast Ben Affleck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's another story.</v>

56
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.530
<v Speaker 1>There were even rumors that a Justice </v>
<v Speaker 1>League movie,</v>

57
00:03:17.531 --> 00:03:20.590
<v Speaker 1>the superior analog of the avengers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion,</v>

58
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.330
<v Speaker 1>is in the cars for 2017 fingers and toes</v>
<v Speaker 1>crossed.</v>

59
00:03:25.331 --> 00:03:28.360
<v Speaker 1>Who knows what phase marvel will be in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By then,</v>

60
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.120
<v Speaker 1>the stories can only get deeper and more</v>
<v Speaker 1>complex.</v>

61
00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.983
<v Speaker 1>It's a big production to fold directors </v>
<v Speaker 1>and actors and writers into a shared </v>

62
00:03:36.071 --> 00:03:36.904
<v Speaker 1>universe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's worth all that trouble if the </v>

63
00:03:38.861 --> 00:03:43.810
<v Speaker 1>product is a whole new class of cinema.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey everybody.</v>

64
00:03:43.811 --> 00:03:47.020
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for watching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a huge comic Book Fan and Comic Book</v>

65
00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.853
<v Speaker 1>Movie Fan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might know that from some previous </v>

66
00:03:48.641 --> 00:03:52.300
<v Speaker 1>videos on the DC person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always read DC comics.</v>

67
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.400
<v Speaker 1>Superman has been my favorite superhero </v>
<v Speaker 1>forever,</v>

68
00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:59.401
<v Speaker 1>so it's so painful to watch what DC is </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing in their film universe,</v>

69
00:03:59.801 --> 00:04:04.801
<v Speaker 1>especially giving Zack Snyder the reigns</v>
<v Speaker 1>to superman and Batman and it just,</v>

70
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.570
<v Speaker 1>it it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It pains me a lot.</v>

71
00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.960
<v Speaker 1>If you have an idea for a topic you'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>like me to cover a write in the comments</v>

72
00:04:10.961 --> 00:04:13.360
<v Speaker 1>and also I love your comments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keep commenting.</v>

73
00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:14.403
<v Speaker 1>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to try to respond to as many </v>

74
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.050
<v Speaker 1>as I can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully I can do all of them.</v>

75
00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:19.990
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for watching and I'll see you </v>
<v Speaker 1>next time.</v>
