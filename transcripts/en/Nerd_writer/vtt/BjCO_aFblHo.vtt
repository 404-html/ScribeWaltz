1
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:03.743
<v Speaker 1>Wager that a good number of artists and </v>
<v Speaker 1>ambitious creative people like myself </v>

2
00:00:06.871 --> 00:00:10.740
<v Speaker 1>spend a dreadful amount of time </v>
<v Speaker 1>considering their legacy.</v>

3
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.350
<v Speaker 1>How will I be remembered what works of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mine,</v>

4
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.870
<v Speaker 1>if any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will carry on into posterity,</v>

5
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.080
<v Speaker 1>immortality through art,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to give you a sense of time.</v>

6
00:00:19.081 --> 00:00:21.660
<v Speaker 1>If Shakespeare wrote Romeo and Juliet </v>
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>

7
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.470
<v Speaker 1>critics and all lovers of the written </v>
<v Speaker 1>word would still be pouring over.</v>

8
00:00:25.471 --> 00:00:28.170
<v Speaker 1>It's possible meanings in the year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty four,</v>

9
00:00:28.171 --> 00:00:29.004
<v Speaker 1>31 a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If Plato uploaded the republic onto the </v>

10
00:00:31.621 --> 00:00:32.454
<v Speaker 1>kindle library this afternoon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>political scholars would still be </v>

11
00:00:34.981 --> 00:00:37.800
<v Speaker 1>debating it's efficacy in 44,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

12
00:00:37.801 --> 00:00:39.570
<v Speaker 1>eight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or as it's popularly known,</v>

13
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:40.583
<v Speaker 1>you're 92 after the pen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Galactic Battle of Gemini Centaury Long </v>

14
00:00:43.411 --> 00:00:44.870
<v Speaker 1>live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Republican,</v>

15
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:45.953
<v Speaker 1>the yearning for such immortality is no </v>
<v Speaker 1>doubt a stupid enterprise born of some </v>

16
00:00:49.321 --> 00:00:51.900
<v Speaker 1>combination of narcissism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>insecurity,</v>

17
00:00:51.901 --> 00:00:52.734
<v Speaker 1>and the fear of death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it doesn't even solve the real </v>

18
00:00:54.541 --> 00:00:55.920
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As Woody Allen said,</v>

19
00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to achieve immortality </v>
<v Speaker 1>through my work.</v>

20
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.490
<v Speaker 1>I want to achieve immortality through </v>
<v Speaker 1>not dying.</v>

21
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.353
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the appealing thing about having your </v>

22
00:01:04.471 --> 00:01:05.304
<v Speaker 1>work live on is that presumably it's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>best part of you and history can </v>

23
00:01:08.551 --> 00:01:12.180
<v Speaker 1>graciously forget the rest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want my ads yet unwritten,</v>

24
00:01:12.181 --> 00:01:15.180
<v Speaker 1>great American novel to achieve </v>
<v Speaker 1>posthumous a claim,</v>

25
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:20.300
<v Speaker 1>not this picture of me and the raccoon </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was apparently living on my head.</v>

26
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.310
<v Speaker 1>Some things we want to be forgotten.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

27
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.490
<v Speaker 1>that's easier said than done in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet age.</v>

28
00:01:26.491 --> 00:01:28.620
<v Speaker 1>In 1998,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Spanish newspaper,</v>

29
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:29.490
<v Speaker 1>Lavonne,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guardian,</v>

30
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.380
<v Speaker 1>published a local announcement about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>forced sale of a home due to outstanding</v>

31
00:01:34.381 --> 00:01:35.214
<v Speaker 1>social security debts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The property and the debts belong to a </v>

32
00:01:38.131 --> 00:01:43.131
<v Speaker 1>Spanish lawyer named Mario Gonzales in </v>
<v Speaker 1>2009 11 years later.</v>

33
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:44.633
<v Speaker 1>Gonzalez didn't appreciate that even </v>
<v Speaker 1>then when you searched his name on </v>

34
00:01:47.851 --> 00:01:48.684
<v Speaker 1>Google,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you saw at the top of the results </v>

35
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.510
<v Speaker 1>was this small financial lapse from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>late nineties.</v>

36
00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.660
<v Speaker 1>Didn't he have a right for that </v>
<v Speaker 1>information to be?</v>

37
00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:58.763
<v Speaker 1>Last Gonzalez contacted Lavonne.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guardian asked for them to take the </v>

38
00:02:01.561 --> 00:02:03.570
<v Speaker 1>story down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They said no.</v>

39
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:04.463
<v Speaker 1>So he filed a complaint with the Spanish</v>
<v Speaker 1>data protection agency asking for the </v>

40
00:02:07.741 --> 00:02:08.574
<v Speaker 1>paper to remove the story and also for </v>
<v Speaker 1>Google to do the same from its search </v>

41
00:02:12.751 --> 00:02:15.630
<v Speaker 1>engines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The agency director rejected the request</v>

42
00:02:15.631 --> 00:02:18.420
<v Speaker 1>to the newspaper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but upheld the one to google,</v>

43
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.860
<v Speaker 1>telling them to remove the links and </v>
<v Speaker 1>make access to that data impossible.</v>

44
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:23.723
<v Speaker 1>After some wrangling and appeals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the highest court in the European Union </v>

45
00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:27.383
<v Speaker 1>supported the agency directors demand </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying that Google was responsible for </v>

46
00:02:30.991 --> 00:02:35.991
<v Speaker 1>the processing of personal data and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people had a right to erasure or a right</v>

47
00:02:36.241 --> 00:02:37.074
<v Speaker 1>to be forgotten.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's your instinctive reaction to </v>

48
00:02:39.151 --> 00:02:39.984
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you feel a strong sympathy for </v>

49
00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:42.683
<v Speaker 1>decent people who are just trying to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>out from under the shadow of the </v>

50
00:02:45.361 --> 00:02:48.300
<v Speaker 1>worldwide web who want their pasts to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>private.</v>

51
00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:49.163
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do we want business people handling our </v>

52
00:02:50.701 --> 00:02:51.630
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

53
00:02:51.631 --> 00:02:56.631
<v Speaker 1>to be able to erase a prior bankruptcy </v>
<v Speaker 1>or a politician to delete some troubling</v>

54
00:02:56.761 --> 00:02:57.594
<v Speaker 1>behavior from the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem with the court's ruling is </v>

55
00:03:00.131 --> 00:03:00.964
<v Speaker 1>that the boundaries for lodging a </v>
<v Speaker 1>complaint are so incredibly vague and </v>

56
00:03:04.181 --> 00:03:05.014
<v Speaker 1>open to interpretation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The court only says the information </v>

57
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.840
<v Speaker 1>which is no longer relevant or timely </v>
<v Speaker 1>can be erased,</v>

58
00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.040
<v Speaker 1>but who gets to decide that American </v>
<v Speaker 1>legal scholars are confident that such a</v>

59
00:03:15.041 --> 00:03:20.020
<v Speaker 1>law would not be passed in the states </v>
<v Speaker 1>where free speech protected by the First</v>

60
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.370
<v Speaker 1>Amendment is champion more readily than </v>
<v Speaker 1>each individual's right to privacy,</v>

61
00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:29.050
<v Speaker 1>though both are precious to us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A recent pew study found that 68 percent</v>

62
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.913
<v Speaker 1>of American internet users believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>current laws are not good enough in </v>

63
00:03:33.011 --> 00:03:33.844
<v Speaker 1>protecting people's privacy online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and 86 percent have taken steps to mask </v>

64
00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:39.640
<v Speaker 1>their digital footprint.</v>

65
00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.940
<v Speaker 1>Privacy is not a word that appears in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the US Constitution.</v>

66
00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:44.043
<v Speaker 1>The right to privacy is a relatively </v>
<v Speaker 1>recent concept introduced by Louis </v>

67
00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.780
<v Speaker 1>Brandeis in an essay in the Harvard law </v>
<v Speaker 1>review from 1890.</v>

68
00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:52.643
<v Speaker 1>This question is really hard to work out</v>
<v Speaker 1>what effects do my demands to have this </v>

69
00:03:56.951 --> 00:04:01.000
<v Speaker 1>picture of me doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A keg stand taken off some random blog,</v>

70
00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:05.170
<v Speaker 1>have on an open and free internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not readily apparent,</v>

71
00:04:05.171 --> 00:04:06.004
<v Speaker 1>but when Google or facebook are burden </v>
<v Speaker 1>with that choice at the peril of fines </v>

72
00:04:09.851 --> 00:04:13.150
<v Speaker 1>are worse than the path of least </v>
<v Speaker 1>resistance may be to say,</v>

73
00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.500
<v Speaker 1>just take it down and I think we can all</v>
<v Speaker 1>see the slippery slope in that.</v>

74
00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.490
<v Speaker 1>In the description under worksighted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll leave links to educated opinions on</v>

75
00:04:21.491 --> 00:04:25.000
<v Speaker 1>both sides of this argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The US and Europe are primed.</v>

76
00:04:25.001 --> 00:04:29.620
<v Speaker 1>It seems to go down different roads here</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I can't say which is the right one.</v>

77
00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.160
<v Speaker 1>It's easy to choose between liberty and </v>
<v Speaker 1>constraint,</v>

78
00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:34.593
<v Speaker 1>but to make a judgment call is much </v>
<v Speaker 1>harder when to liberties are at odds </v>

79
00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:40.023
<v Speaker 1>with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so many things to read about </v>

80
00:04:42.921 --> 00:04:43.970
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If nothing else,</v>

81
00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.903
<v Speaker 1>checkout Louis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brandeis is essay on the right to </v>

82
00:04:46.821 --> 00:04:47.654
<v Speaker 1>privacy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is just a seminal essay in the </v>

83
00:04:50.211 --> 00:04:51.044
<v Speaker 1>history of law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Comments below or ask me anything on </v>

84
00:04:54.501 --> 00:04:55.970
<v Speaker 1>Tumbler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll put the link in the description.</v>

85
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.130
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for watching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll see you next Friday.</v>
