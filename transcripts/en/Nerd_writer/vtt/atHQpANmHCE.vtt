1
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:08.663
<v Speaker 1>I started analyzing paintings as a way </v>
<v Speaker 1>to confront the problem of not engaging </v>

2
00:00:12.781 --> 00:00:16.410
<v Speaker 1>with certain forms of genres of art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you stand at a museum,</v>

3
00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.420
<v Speaker 1>look at a Kandinsky or a monet or Surat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and wonder what exactly am I supposed to</v>

4
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.883
<v Speaker 1>feel here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certain paintings seem particularly </v>

5
00:00:25.201 --> 00:00:26.034
<v Speaker 1>stubborn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unwilling to move even an inch in your </v>

6
00:00:27.661 --> 00:00:28.494
<v Speaker 1>direction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leaving you with a massive void to fill </v>

7
00:00:30.631 --> 00:00:31.464
<v Speaker 1>with unanchored interpretation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what about paintings that do the </v>

8
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.330
<v Speaker 1>opposite?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rename a greets.</v>

9
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.400
<v Speaker 1>The treachery of images moves more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>an inch in the direction of the viewer.</v>

10
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.203
<v Speaker 1>It goes all the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The painting speaks in a language that </v>

11
00:00:48.481 --> 00:00:51.870
<v Speaker 1>we can understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to say language itself,</v>

12
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.760
<v Speaker 1>sustain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pass on peep.</v>

13
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.170
<v Speaker 1>This is not a pipe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The painting actually says something.</v>

14
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.240
<v Speaker 1>It engages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It talks.</v>

15
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.060
<v Speaker 1>So what's it trying to say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>

16
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.180
<v Speaker 1>let's talk for a moment about renamer </v>
<v Speaker 1>greed.</v>

17
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.520
<v Speaker 1>One of the most famous and lasting of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the surrealist artists.</v>

18
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.940
<v Speaker 1>A man who never really thought of </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself as a painter,</v>

19
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:12.803
<v Speaker 1>more a thinker that used images to </v>
<v Speaker 1>express himself once he landed on an </v>

20
00:01:16.741 --> 00:01:17.574
<v Speaker 1>aesthetic style.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It never really changed or evolved </v>

21
00:01:19.531 --> 00:01:20.364
<v Speaker 1>throughout his career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well versed in philosophical writing </v>

22
00:01:22.501 --> 00:01:27.450
<v Speaker 1>from Plato to Food Co,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he used that style to investigate ideas.</v>

23
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.170
<v Speaker 1>His program was to confuse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to evoke mystery,</v>

24
00:01:31.171 --> 00:01:32.004
<v Speaker 1>to show us that what we want is always </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind the thing we see and that the </v>

25
00:01:37.201 --> 00:01:38.034
<v Speaker 1>obstruction can never be removed </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely because it's not in the </v>

26
00:01:41.131 --> 00:01:45.000
<v Speaker 1>object.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's envisioned and thought itself.</v>

27
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.210
<v Speaker 1>The treachery of images approaches these</v>
<v Speaker 1>themes directly.</v>

28
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.060
<v Speaker 1>The painting at first is obvious in its </v>
<v Speaker 1>message.</v>

29
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.800
<v Speaker 1>It shows an image of a pipe and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>underneath the image it tells or reminds</v>

30
00:01:55.801 --> 00:02:00.801
<v Speaker 1>the viewer that this is not a pipe and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we can infer the rest.</v>

31
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.673
<v Speaker 1>Obviously that's not a pipe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a representation of a pipe and </v>

32
00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.310
<v Speaker 1>regret means to show us that </v>
<v Speaker 1>representations are not the real thing.</v>

33
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.050
<v Speaker 1>They only resemble the real thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but of course that's common sense.</v>

34
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.660
<v Speaker 1>Who in the world would argue the </v>
<v Speaker 1>opposite position,</v>

35
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.450
<v Speaker 1>but a curious question comes out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

36
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.410
<v Speaker 1>If someone showed you this image and </v>
<v Speaker 1>asked you what it was,</v>

37
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.800
<v Speaker 1>what would you say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably you'd say it's an apple,</v>

38
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.780
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or what about this image?</v>

39
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.240
<v Speaker 1>It's a man or this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a train.</v>

40
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.370
<v Speaker 1>This is a house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a dog.</v>

41
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.680
<v Speaker 1>This is a hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a pipe.</v>

42
00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.240
<v Speaker 1>This little accident of language is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>really an accident at all.</v>

43
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.780
<v Speaker 1>For many hundreds of years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings have supposed that language</v>

44
00:02:42.781 --> 00:02:43.614
<v Speaker 1>and reality had an organic relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the names of things in a way arose </v>

45
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.923
<v Speaker 1>out of the things themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that a tree was in fact a tree that </v>

46
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.190
<v Speaker 1>Kanye West is in fact Kanye west and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that a pipe is really a pipe.</v>

47
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.520
<v Speaker 1>All of that was challenged by the famous</v>
<v Speaker 1>linguist Ferdinand and sauce.</v>

48
00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.393
<v Speaker 1>You're an extremely influential figure </v>
<v Speaker 1>who saw that a thing and it's name have </v>

49
00:03:08.411 --> 00:03:13.411
<v Speaker 1>a totally arbitrary relationship that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't really know things but only access</v>

50
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.273
<v Speaker 1>their shadow through language in which </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything has a meaning in the context </v>

51
00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:20.373
<v Speaker 1>of the system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After so many centuries of trusting the </v>

52
00:03:22.721 --> 00:03:25.840
<v Speaker 1>word implicitly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these insights were hard.</v>

53
00:03:25.841 --> 00:03:26.674
<v Speaker 1>One so hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one that marguerite saw that the old </v>

54
00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.270
<v Speaker 1>wrongheaded ways of thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

55
00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.860
<v Speaker 1>We're still hiding in the way we thought</v>
<v Speaker 1>and talked about images.</v>

56
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.023
<v Speaker 1>Realistic painting plays on resemblance </v>
<v Speaker 1>and resemblance suggests a hierarchy </v>

57
00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:42.303
<v Speaker 1>that the image of a pipe resembles that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it points outside language to the thing </v>

58
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.883
<v Speaker 1>in itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The falseness of this claim is what </v>

59
00:03:49.331 --> 00:03:53.980
<v Speaker 1>inspired the abstract artists to move </v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond resemblance into a field in which</v>

60
00:03:53.981 --> 00:03:57.370
<v Speaker 1>painting had no reference in reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As such,</v>

61
00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.233
<v Speaker 1>we agreed on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes this point using the false </v>

62
00:04:00.971 --> 00:04:04.420
<v Speaker 1>premises of resemblance and shatters </v>
<v Speaker 1>them from within.</v>

63
00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.720
<v Speaker 1>The visual secret dependence on language</v>
<v Speaker 1>is laid bare in the treachery of images.</v>

64
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:10.743
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that dependence is the treachery of </v>

65
00:04:13.001 --> 00:04:13.834
<v Speaker 1>images.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here we have an image and a sentence </v>

66
00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.470
<v Speaker 1>laid out like a page from a botanical </v>
<v Speaker 1>textbook begging to be connected,</v>

67
00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.513
<v Speaker 1>but why should we connect them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why should the sentence and the image </v>

68
00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.420
<v Speaker 1>refer to one another?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do we know that the word this points</v>

69
00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.610
<v Speaker 1>upward?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course we don't know,</v>

70
00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.370
<v Speaker 1>but the Pronoun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the resemblance and the name,</v>

71
00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:38.850
<v Speaker 1>I'll make that connection inevitable and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's that inevitability that's made real</v>

72
00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.233
<v Speaker 1>in every aspect of our lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We go about our days confident that </v>

73
00:04:43.511 --> 00:04:47.680
<v Speaker 1>everything we see could be said and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the images we say it could be seen,</v>

74
00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.950
<v Speaker 1>but if you've ever used the phrase you </v>
<v Speaker 1>had to be there,</v>

75
00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.023
<v Speaker 1>you know that these are two realities </v>
<v Speaker 1>that do not overlap in the way we act </v>

76
00:04:55.931 --> 00:04:58.600
<v Speaker 1>like they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not a pipe.</v>

77
00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.470
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is not a pipe either.</v>

78
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.933
<v Speaker 1>And if this is not a pipe than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sentence scrawled in it's cute </v>

79
00:05:06.251 --> 00:05:09.550
<v Speaker 1>schoolboy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cursive is actually a contradiction.</v>

80
00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:14.350
<v Speaker 1>The contradiction that pulls the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>painting apart at the seams and makes it</v>

81
00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.273
<v Speaker 1>utter nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if Margaret laughed about </v>

82
00:05:17.861 --> 00:05:18.694
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I hope he did because what's more </v>

83
00:05:20.321 --> 00:05:21.154
<v Speaker 1>forceful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not moving an inch in the direction of </v>

84
00:05:23.471 --> 00:05:24.304
<v Speaker 1>the viewer or moving a question all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way into the center of the viewer's </v>

85
00:05:28.301 --> 00:05:29.134
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That on the slightest prodding and </v>

86
00:05:30.941 --> 00:05:33.830
<v Speaker 1>examination implodes.</v>
