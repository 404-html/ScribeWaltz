1
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:07.833
<v Speaker 1>There are a few ways that you can build </v>
<v Speaker 1>up tension in a movie scene through </v>

2
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.880
<v Speaker 1>camera work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through pacing,</v>

3
00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.330
<v Speaker 1>and probably most commonly through </v>
<v Speaker 1>music,</v>

4
00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:17.403
<v Speaker 1>like the music you're hearing right now </v>
<v Speaker 1>in this incredibly tense scene from </v>

5
00:00:19.931 --> 00:00:22.870
<v Speaker 1>Steven Spielberg's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2005 film Munich,</v>

6
00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:29.010
<v Speaker 1>except there is no music in the seat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm getting ahead of myself.</v>

7
00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:34.593
<v Speaker 1>Let's back up.</v>

8
00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:38.703
<v Speaker 1>We all know that movies have only two </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways into your brain through your eyes </v>

9
00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:43.503
<v Speaker 1>and your ears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you've ever had the chance to </v>

10
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.370
<v Speaker 1>edit a movie or a short film or even a </v>
<v Speaker 1>small video,</v>

11
00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.340
<v Speaker 1>it quickly becomes apparent that when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're watching something,</v>

12
00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.760
<v Speaker 1>these two senses are weirdly </v>
<v Speaker 1>interconnected.</v>

13
00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.570
<v Speaker 1>The visual side of film gets most of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention because it's right in front of</v>

14
00:00:58.571 --> 00:01:01.270
<v Speaker 1>you and it's usually what you remember </v>
<v Speaker 1>after a movie is over,</v>

15
00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.350
<v Speaker 1>but in many ways the visuals are simply </v>
<v Speaker 1>the face of the operation.</v>

16
00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.440
<v Speaker 1>While the audio is actually the puppet </v>
<v Speaker 1>master,</v>

17
00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:09.870
<v Speaker 1>the one that really holds them</v>

18
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.590
<v Speaker 2>power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

19
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.630
<v Speaker 1>Let me show you what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take a look at this scene right here.</v>

20
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.850
<v Speaker 1>So what does Spielberg want you to pay </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention to?</v>

21
00:01:34.851 --> 00:01:38.360
<v Speaker 1>Hear these people walking by and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>car passing,</v>

22
00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:40.850
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not what Spielberg wants.</v>

23
00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:42.163
<v Speaker 1>It's what I want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since that was the sound design I just </v>

24
00:01:44.631 --> 00:01:47.340
<v Speaker 1>made for that shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's what the actual shots sound stuff</v>

25
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.590
<v Speaker 2>still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>besides</v>

26
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.300
<v Speaker 1>being infinitely better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's easy to notice how the sound really</v>

27
00:02:09.301 --> 00:02:12.690
<v Speaker 1>affects what you see and from what </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective you see it.</v>

28
00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.943
<v Speaker 1>In my version,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shot had an omniscient third person </v>

29
00:02:16.351 --> 00:02:19.890
<v Speaker 1>point of view in the real version.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as the audio starts,</v>

30
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:20.753
<v Speaker 1>you're placed in a perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first thing you hear is a </v>

31
00:02:22.951 --> 00:02:27.270
<v Speaker 1>conversation from street level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so even though the long lens is fixed on</v>

32
00:02:27.271 --> 00:02:28.104
<v Speaker 1>Eric Bana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the moment is taking place on </v>

33
00:02:30.301 --> 00:02:32.280
<v Speaker 1>the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then to drive the point home,</v>

34
00:02:32.281 --> 00:02:33.114
<v Speaker 1>you hear Daniel Craig singing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>temptations and the vocal recording is </v>

35
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.740
<v Speaker 1>close,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intimate.</v>

36
00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.490
<v Speaker 1>Even though you never go inside the car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's enough to put you there.</v>

37
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.010
<v Speaker 1>Then the car that you're really supposed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to pay attention to,</v>

38
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.910
<v Speaker 1>the black one parks and the sound of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>parking jumps out in the mix.</v>

39
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.180
<v Speaker 1>Just like you wouldn't hear Daniel Craig</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that way from where the camera is.</v>

40
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.253
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't hear the car that clearly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the sound design picks these things </v>

41
00:02:54.961 --> 00:02:59.961
<v Speaker 1>out to tell a specific story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Still stays shut up.</v>

42
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.953
<v Speaker 1>The point here is that in film you </v>
<v Speaker 1>really do see with your ears more than </v>

43
00:03:05.621 --> 00:03:09.730
<v Speaker 1>you think and sound doesn't mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That image gets the credit because a key</v>

44
00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:12.670
<v Speaker 1>to the power of sound design is its </v>
<v Speaker 1>invisibility.</v>

45
00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:13.803
<v Speaker 1>If dialogue sounds close than you are </v>
<v Speaker 1>close to the person who's speaking it </v>

46
00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:18.723
<v Speaker 1>wherever they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My brothers would choose my Papaya and </v>

47
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.900
<v Speaker 1>my sister were both hanging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

48
00:03:24.901 --> 00:03:26.850
<v Speaker 1>so back to the sequence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

49
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:28.450
<v Speaker 1>forgot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No music</v>

50
00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.940
<v Speaker 1>for a minute and 52nd seat is without </v>
<v Speaker 1>music and almost entirely wordless.</v>

51
00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:36.223
<v Speaker 1>How does Spielberg and legendary sound </v>
<v Speaker 1>designer Ben Burtt who gave the world </v>

52
00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.910
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do they build the tension here?</v>

53
00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.013
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>burt does it by building a bed of </v>

54
00:03:46.521 --> 00:03:51.521
<v Speaker 1>constant noisy city ambiens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then singling out and stringing together</v>

55
00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.490
<v Speaker 1>like beads on a wire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Key noises that tell the story.</v>

56
00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:56.653
<v Speaker 1>The background is that Eric Bana and his</v>
<v Speaker 1>team are going to assassinate this man </v>

57
00:03:59.421 --> 00:04:00.254
<v Speaker 1>and his home by getting him to answer a </v>
<v Speaker 1>phone that they've secretly installed a </v>

58
00:04:02.811 --> 00:04:06.770
<v Speaker 1>bomb in the string of isolated plot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sounds goes like this.</v>

59
00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.993
<v Speaker 1>The car with the assassins arrives the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dialogue of the targets wife and </v>

60
00:04:11.721 --> 00:04:16.460
<v Speaker 1>especially young daughter than their car</v>
<v Speaker 1>pulling away signaling it's safe to move</v>

61
00:04:16.461 --> 00:04:17.294
<v Speaker 1>forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the coins and rotary phone that </v>

62
00:04:19.611 --> 00:04:22.970
<v Speaker 1>will make the call then the priming of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the detonator</v>

63
00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.110
<v Speaker 2>and then wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was that</v>

64
00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.490
<v Speaker 1>first moment of trouble comes in south.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Up until now,</v>

65
00:04:32.491 --> 00:04:36.330
<v Speaker 1>the isolated noises represent the steps </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the plan going smoothly.</v>

66
00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.560
<v Speaker 1>The truck passing by represents a break </v>
<v Speaker 1>in that chain and a hitch in the plan.</v>

67
00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:42.563
<v Speaker 1>At this point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ambience outside starts to take on </v>

68
00:04:44.161 --> 00:04:44.994
<v Speaker 1>some strange qualities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a high pitched whine like a </v>

69
00:04:47.311 --> 00:04:51.240
<v Speaker 1>train stopping on top of everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just like the moving truck blocks,</v>

70
00:04:51.241 --> 00:04:52.074
<v Speaker 1>the assassins view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the movers talking keeps them from </v>

71
00:04:54.361 --> 00:04:56.970
<v Speaker 1>hearing the daughter's car pull back up </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the apartment.</v>

72
00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.150
<v Speaker 1>She plays a key part in the scene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So burt isolates her again,</v>

73
00:05:00.151 --> 00:05:02.820
<v Speaker 1>but not her voice this time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her footsteps,</v>

74
00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.990
<v Speaker 1>which continue indoors in the apartment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ambiance is quiet,</v>

75
00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:08.093
<v Speaker 1>and the really incredible thing about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this scene is that Burton Spielberg </v>

76
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.310
<v Speaker 1>build the tension not by working toward </v>
<v Speaker 1>a great crescendo of noise,</v>

77
00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.120
<v Speaker 1>but by gradually subtracting elements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once the daughter is up here,</v>

78
00:05:18.121 --> 00:05:20.640
<v Speaker 1>the danger can be signaled by a single </v>
<v Speaker 1>sound.</v>

79
00:05:20.641 --> 00:05:20.780
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

80
00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:21.613
<v Speaker 2>perfect.</v>

81
00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:24.813
<v Speaker 1>The important elements have been set up </v>
<v Speaker 1>so well by this point that you could </v>

82
00:05:27.581 --> 00:05:30.550
<v Speaker 1>follow the rest of the scene without </v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing it at all.</v>

83
00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:40.140
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hello.</v>

84
00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.920
<v Speaker 2>Hello.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hello.</v>

85
00:05:58.910 --> 00:05:59.743
<v Speaker 2>I know</v>

86
00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:06.040
<v Speaker 1>the climax of this scene brilliantly is </v>
<v Speaker 1>silence,</v>

87
00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:07.653
<v Speaker 1>but it's the silence that works so well </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it anticipates the noise of an </v>

88
00:06:11.651 --> 00:06:16.651
<v Speaker 1>explosion to come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At this point.</v>

89
00:06:25.381 --> 00:06:26.214
<v Speaker 1>The ambience has become really </v>
<v Speaker 1>impressionistic and when it comes back </v>

90
00:06:28.591 --> 00:06:30.330
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has echo and reverb.</v>

91
00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:32.760
<v Speaker 1>It's hurried footsteps and an anxious </v>
<v Speaker 1>siren.</v>

92
00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.690
<v Speaker 1>The wholesale universe corresponds in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>personal way to the assassins,</v>

93
00:06:36.691 --> 00:06:37.524
<v Speaker 1>to their feelings and their nerves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it makes sense that when the final </v>

94
00:06:40.531 --> 00:06:41.364
<v Speaker 1>question is asked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the sound design that answers the </v>

95
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:45.943
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure what they're doing in film </v>

96
00:06:47.311 --> 00:06:48.144
<v Speaker 1>school these days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you have any interest in making </v>

97
00:06:49.981 --> 00:06:50.410
<v Speaker 1>movies</v>

98
00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:51.243
<v Speaker 3>at all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't attempt to make a scene </v>

99
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.070
<v Speaker 3>like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No dialogue,</v>

100
00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.310
<v Speaker 3>no music,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just camera work in sound design.</v>

101
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.040
<v Speaker 3>Once you finished it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>watch the scene back.</v>

102
00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:04.040
<v Speaker 3>Close Your eyes and ask yourself,</v>

103
00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:05.860
<v Speaker 1>what are your ears?</v>
<v Speaker 1>See?</v>

104
00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:15.883
<v Speaker 1>Hey everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you so much for watching and </v>

105
00:07:16.911 --> 00:07:21.230
<v Speaker 1>welcome to the first video of 2018.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is really exciting.</v>

106
00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:23.930
<v Speaker 1>Just finished my little recharge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>break over the new year,</v>

107
00:07:23.931 --> 00:07:27.950
<v Speaker 1>which was wonderful and I'm ready for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the marathon.</v>

108
00:07:27.951 --> 00:07:30.290
<v Speaker 1>That will be this year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As always,</v>

109
00:07:30.291 --> 00:07:35.291
<v Speaker 1>I want every nerd writer video in 2018 </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be an event for you guys.</v>

110
00:07:35.301 --> 00:07:36.134
<v Speaker 1>I want it to be something that really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really stands out in your subscription </v>

111

<v Speaker 1>make that happen for you guys.</v>

112
00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:43.670
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

113
00:07:43.671 --> 00:07:46.100
<v Speaker 1>New nerdwriter mugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Super exciting.</v>

114
00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:50.030
<v Speaker 1>The mugs are back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Check them out at the store.</v>

115
00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:51.500
<v Speaker 1>You'd find the link below in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>description.</v>

116
00:07:51.501 --> 00:07:53.170
<v Speaker 1>You can see them right here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

117
