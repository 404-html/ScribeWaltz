1
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.970
<v Speaker 1>Thanksgiving wasn't always like it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>

2
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.770
<v Speaker 1>the domestic family meal football,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the parade leftovers,</v>

3
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.000
<v Speaker 1>black Friday like Christmas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It used to be a holiday of festivals,</v>

4
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:27.863
<v Speaker 1>outdoor revelry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and drinking too much like today's </v>

5
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.290
<v Speaker 1>Halloween.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

6
00:00:31.291 --> 00:00:35.400
<v Speaker 1>children would dress up in costumes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>go begging for money or treats.</v>

7
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.770
<v Speaker 1>If you were growing up in 19th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New York City,</v>

8
00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.060
<v Speaker 1>you might see a group of crossdressers </v>
<v Speaker 1>called the fantastical marching the city</v>

9
00:00:42.061 --> 00:00:47.061
<v Speaker 1>streets ridiculing authority figures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't until the mid 18 hundreds that</v>

10
00:00:47.321 --> 00:00:50.880
<v Speaker 1>Sarah Josepha Hale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the godmother of Thanksgiving as we know</v>

11
00:00:50.881 --> 00:00:53.520
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>started writing her famous editorials in</v>

12
00:00:53.521 --> 00:00:54.354
<v Speaker 1>goatees magazine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>recontextualizing the holiday as a </v>

13
00:00:57.061 --> 00:01:00.990
<v Speaker 1>domestic occasion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one in which distance sons and daughters</v>

14
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.033
<v Speaker 1>returned home for a family feast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She urged governors and presidents to </v>

15
00:01:05.611 --> 00:01:09.210
<v Speaker 1>adopt the last Thursday in November as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>national holiday,</v>

16
00:01:09.211 --> 00:01:10.044
<v Speaker 1>and her letters shake with notes of </v>
<v Speaker 1>urgency and the spare is the country </v>

17
00:01:14.101 --> 00:01:15.450
<v Speaker 1>slid to civil war.</v>

18
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:16.763
<v Speaker 1>Thanksgiving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she hoped might hold together under the </v>

19
00:01:19.201 --> 00:01:23.010
<v Speaker 1>banner of brotherhood and gratitude of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Fragile Union.</v>

20
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.020
<v Speaker 1>It didn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

21
00:01:25.021 --> 00:01:26.460
<v Speaker 1>but in 18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>63,</v>

22
00:01:26.461 --> 00:01:29.610
<v Speaker 1>president Lincoln did make Thanksgiving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a federal holiday.</v>

23
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:30.463
<v Speaker 1>The point of pride for Union states then</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the rest of the country as it </v>

24
00:01:33.661 --> 00:01:34.494
<v Speaker 1>rebuilt after the war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hail Lincoln and others of that period </v>

25
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:38.543
<v Speaker 1>effectively rewrote Thanksgiving as </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that happens in doors with </v>

26
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.853
<v Speaker 1>families,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a joyful reuniting but no longer have </v>

27
00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:47.403
<v Speaker 1>rawkus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The tectonic changes of the industrial </v>

28
00:01:49.591 --> 00:01:52.170
<v Speaker 1>and commercial revolutions were pulling </v>
<v Speaker 1>families apart.</v>

29
00:01:52.171 --> 00:01:57.171
<v Speaker 1>They felt threatening to weaken the ties</v>
<v Speaker 1>and values that grounded the nation over</v>

30
00:01:57.511 --> 00:01:58.344
<v Speaker 1>the next decades into the 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanksgiving lost its tolerance for </v>

31
00:02:01.411 --> 00:02:05.910
<v Speaker 1>begging children and drunk and marchers </v>
<v Speaker 1>and picked up new traditions like annual</v>

32
00:02:05.911 --> 00:02:06.744
<v Speaker 1>football games and the macy's Day parade</v>
<v Speaker 1>teachers taught the story of </v>

33
00:02:09.991 --> 00:02:10.824
<v Speaker 1>Thanksgiving to their students,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many of whom urge their immigrant </v>

34
00:02:13.081 --> 00:02:15.660
<v Speaker 1>parents to celebrate the national </v>
<v Speaker 1>ritual,</v>

35
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.250
<v Speaker 1>a way of stirring patriotism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as with all forms of assimilation,</v>

36
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.520
<v Speaker 1>foreign cultures are both absorbed into </v>
<v Speaker 1>and erased by the dominant culture.</v>

37
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.053
<v Speaker 1>The thanksgiving Turkey and its many </v>
<v Speaker 1>side dishes are a great metaphor for </v>

38
00:02:30.121 --> 00:02:30.954
<v Speaker 1>these twin tendencies and many brought </v>
<v Speaker 1>dishes from their own cultures into the </v>

39
00:02:34.441 --> 00:02:39.420
<v Speaker 1>feast to remember their diverse pasts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As long as the Turkey rained.</v>

40
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.313
<v Speaker 1>Overall,</v>

41
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:42.643
<v Speaker 2>this is all to say that traditions like </v>
<v Speaker 2>Thanksgiving aren't natural by any </v>

42
00:02:46.401 --> 00:02:47.234
<v Speaker 2>means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're invented and at the time of </v>

43
00:02:49.221 --> 00:02:50.054
<v Speaker 2>their invention they call to a past </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not really there and imagined </v>

44
00:02:53.871 --> 00:02:58.250
<v Speaker 2>past a constructed authenticity that </v>
<v Speaker 2>serves the purposes of the president.</v>

45
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.270
<v Speaker 2>Indeed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even the awareness of such traditions is</v>

46
00:03:01.271 --> 00:03:02.104
<v Speaker 2>a relatively modern phenomenon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anchoring points for a culture in </v>

47
00:03:05.181 --> 00:03:08.650
<v Speaker 2>constant and progressively more rapid </v>
<v Speaker 2>change.</v>

48
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.890
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot in the DNA of Thanksgiving</v>
<v Speaker 2>worth holding onto,</v>

49
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.993
<v Speaker 2>but there's a lot of which we'd be </v>
<v Speaker 2>better off without a rosy and false </v>

50
00:03:16.301 --> 00:03:20.200
<v Speaker 2>account of our early settlers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>friendship with the native Americans and</v>

51
00:03:20.201 --> 00:03:21.034
<v Speaker 2>ideology of female domesticity and </v>
<v Speaker 2>anachronistic remnant of the separate </v>

52
00:03:24.131 --> 00:03:25.510
<v Speaker 2>spheres.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Way of thinking that said,</v>

53
00:03:25.511 --> 00:03:28.930
<v Speaker 2>a woman's rightful place was at home in </v>
<v Speaker 2>front of the stove.</v>

54
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.330
<v Speaker 2>The assimilation of other cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>races,</v>

55
00:03:31.331 --> 00:03:36.160
<v Speaker 2>and classes into a largely white and </v>
<v Speaker 2>largely Protestant system of thinking.</v>

56
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.720
<v Speaker 2>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the core of Thanksgiving is family.</v>

57
00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.140
<v Speaker 2>The family I was born into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the family I chose,</v>

58
00:03:44.141 --> 00:03:44.974
<v Speaker 2>the community I live in and the nation </v>
<v Speaker 2>that gives me the freedom to think </v>

59
00:03:47.951 --> 00:03:51.400
<v Speaker 2>through and if I want criticize it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>values.</v>

60
00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.700
<v Speaker 2>These days in the wake of terror around </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world,</v>

61
00:03:54.701 --> 00:03:55.534
<v Speaker 2>what our worst reactionary tendencies </v>
<v Speaker 2>are flared by those far too willing to </v>

62
00:03:59.141 --> 00:03:59.940
<v Speaker 2>stoke fear</v>

63
00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.190
<v Speaker 1>at anchor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's worth remembering,</v>

64
00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.240
<v Speaker 1>I think just how many different families</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all belong to.</v>

65
00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.830
<v Speaker 1>We may be celebrating in separate homes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in reality,</v>

66
00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.340
<v Speaker 1>each family in America blends into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>next.</v>

67
00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.190
<v Speaker 1>If the history of Thanksgiving shows us </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>

68
00:04:17.191 --> 00:04:22.170
<v Speaker 1>it's that holidays like these are open </v>
<v Speaker 1>to revision as Americans.</v>

69
00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.580
<v Speaker 1>Thanksgiving is ours to reframe just as </v>
<v Speaker 1>the country is.</v>

70
00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.850
<v Speaker 1>That's an important responsibility for </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of us.</v>

71
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.660
<v Speaker 1>Have responsibility for which I give.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>

72
00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:36.623
<v Speaker 1>Hey everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for watching and happy </v>

73
