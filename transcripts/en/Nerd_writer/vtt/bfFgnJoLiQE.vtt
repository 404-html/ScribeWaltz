1
00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:05.353
<v Speaker 1>Detective fiction always turns on it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>revelations on those moments when </v>

2
00:00:09.681 --> 00:00:14.210
<v Speaker 1>information suddenly transforms into </v>
<v Speaker 1>cause and effect,</v>

3
00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:16.910
<v Speaker 1>no one is better at achieving those </v>
<v Speaker 1>revelations.</v>

4
00:00:16.911 --> 00:00:17.744
<v Speaker 1>Then private detective Sherlock Holmes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and these days no one is better at </v>

5
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.380
<v Speaker 1>visualizing them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the creators of Sherlock,</v>

6
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:29.620
<v Speaker 1>the intoxicatingly inventive TV show </v>
<v Speaker 1>that uses and imagines film editing as a</v>

7
00:00:31.131 --> 00:00:33.270
<v Speaker 1>function of its main character's mind.</v>

8
00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.800
<v Speaker 2>You said your life turned on one word.</v>

9
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.320
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The name of the person the father wanted</v>

10
00:00:39.321 --> 00:00:39.930
<v Speaker 3>to kill.</v>

11
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:40.763
<v Speaker 1>Today I want to look at how sherlock </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets from point a to point b from </v>

12
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.710
<v Speaker 1>problem to solution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mystery to clarity,</v>

13
00:00:46.711 --> 00:00:50.580
<v Speaker 1>and one of the shows most extraordinary </v>
<v Speaker 1>visual revelations.</v>

14
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.510
<v Speaker 1>It's a sequence that lasts three minutes</v>
<v Speaker 1>and 42 seconds with a fresh,</v>

15
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.100
<v Speaker 1>weird idea and almost every beat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a complete joy to watch unfold.</v>

16
00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.660
<v Speaker 2>You said your life turned on one word.</v>

17
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.100
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The name of the person the father wanted</v>

18
00:01:05.101 --> 00:01:05.700
<v Speaker 3>to kill</v>

19
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.533
<v Speaker 1>the background is this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the daughter of famous multimillionaire </v>

20
00:01:08.791 --> 00:01:09.624
<v Speaker 1>Culverton Smith knows her father wants </v>
<v Speaker 1>to kill someone but doesn't know who it </v>

21
00:01:13.861 --> 00:01:14.694
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to kill someone and she was told </v>

22
00:01:16.501 --> 00:01:17.334
<v Speaker 1>the name once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but under the influence of a drug that </v>

23
00:01:19.111 --> 00:01:22.300
<v Speaker 1>wiped her memory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All she knows is that it's one word</v>

24
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.730
<v Speaker 2>that's the impossible thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just that right there.</v>

25
00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.990
<v Speaker 2>Some possible names are one word that </v>
<v Speaker 2>always at least two.</v>

26
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.913
<v Speaker 1>The added element here at one that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to spin this revelation into a </v>

27
00:01:31.381 --> 00:01:35.460
<v Speaker 1>whole nother gear is that Sherlock </v>
<v Speaker 1>Holmes is on drugs.</v>

28
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:36.563
<v Speaker 1>He's been shooting cocaine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a reference to the original Conan doyle </v>

29
00:01:39.061 --> 00:01:39.894
<v Speaker 1>stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's accelerating and twisting his </v>

30
00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:42.780
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

31
00:01:42.781 --> 00:01:43.614
<v Speaker 1>it's a pain of withdrawal from these </v>
<v Speaker 1>drugs that puts the entire sequence in </v>

32
00:01:47.431 --> 00:01:48.264
<v Speaker 1>motion.</v>

33
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.140
<v Speaker 4>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I expect it.</v>

34
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.910
<v Speaker 4>What am I nicer</v>

35
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:12.553
<v Speaker 1>in a mystery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a revelation on the part of the </v>

36
00:02:14.361 --> 00:02:15.194
<v Speaker 1>detective or the audience only works </v>
<v Speaker 1>when it arises from information already </v>

37
00:02:18.591 --> 00:02:21.590
<v Speaker 1>known.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's new is the perspective,</v>

38
00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:22.783
<v Speaker 1>and that change in perspective is </v>
<v Speaker 1>triggered usually by something that </v>

39
00:02:25.281 --> 00:02:26.114
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this kind of revelation is a </v>

40
00:02:28.191 --> 00:02:29.024
<v Speaker 1>cliche by now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what sherlock does differently is </v>

41
00:02:31.791 --> 00:02:35.420
<v Speaker 1>stage those perspective shifts in its </v>
<v Speaker 1>camera work and editing.</v>

42
00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:36.643
<v Speaker 1>In that first subsequence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see sherlock from every possible </v>

43
00:02:39.711 --> 00:02:40.544
<v Speaker 1>angle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even from one that's impossible thanks </v>

44
00:02:42.651 --> 00:02:43.484
<v Speaker 1>to his drug induced state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>punctuated by subliminal negative shots </v>

45
00:02:46.911 --> 00:02:51.020
<v Speaker 1>of the confession paper that faith was </v>
<v Speaker 1>holding and a compliment.</v>

46
00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.700
<v Speaker 4>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I expect it nicer.</v>

47
00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.310
<v Speaker 4>Anyone.</v>

48
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.340
<v Speaker 1>It's not just that sherlock </v>
<v Speaker 1>recontextualizes old information.</v>

49
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:07.203
<v Speaker 1>The filmmakers take great pains to </v>
<v Speaker 1>choreograph a relationship between old </v>

50
00:03:10.931 --> 00:03:13.540
<v Speaker 1>and new perspectives that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversational,</v>

51
00:03:13.541 --> 00:03:16.510
<v Speaker 1>like the present and the past are </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking to each other.</v>

52
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:17.920
<v Speaker 1>In this part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

53
00:03:17.921 --> 00:03:20.800
<v Speaker 1>sherlock stalks the location of an old </v>
<v Speaker 1>episode,</v>

54
00:03:20.801 --> 00:03:23.800
<v Speaker 1>the previous one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now everything is changed.</v>

55
00:03:23.801 --> 00:03:25.990
<v Speaker 1>Instead of seeing the street from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>different angle,</v>

56
00:03:25.991 --> 00:03:28.300
<v Speaker 1>we see it from a totally different </v>
<v Speaker 1>camera lens.</v>

57
00:03:28.301 --> 00:03:29.134
<v Speaker 1>Adding to that sense of attenuated </v>
<v Speaker 1>drugged up disorientation and hear the </v>

58
00:03:33.251 --> 00:03:35.470
<v Speaker 1>conversation with the past is even more </v>
<v Speaker 1>literal.</v>

59
00:03:35.471 --> 00:03:36.304
<v Speaker 1>It's a present shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Past reverse shot is only one way that </v>

60
00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.123
<v Speaker 1>I've been sold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you've already moved the camera and </v>

61
00:03:42.641 --> 00:03:43.474
<v Speaker 1>you've already changed the Lens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why not transplant an entire set from </v>

62
00:03:47.531 --> 00:03:49.610
<v Speaker 1>earlier in the episode?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to kill something.</v>

63
00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:52.440
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

64
00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.770
<v Speaker 1>anyone?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyone?</v>

65
00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:02.263
<v Speaker 1>Anyone else?</v>

66
00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:04.790
<v Speaker 4>Anyone?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anyone?</v>

67
00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:06.123
<v Speaker 4>Anyone?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anyone.</v>

68
00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:09.403
<v Speaker 1>Even more impressive than how Sherlock </v>
<v Speaker 1>arrives at his revelation is how the </v>

69
00:04:12.891 --> 00:04:14.900
<v Speaker 1>hero untangles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what that means,</v>

70
00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.750
<v Speaker 1>and what can only be called a leapfrog </v>
<v Speaker 1>scene.</v>

71
00:04:17.751 --> 00:04:20.210
<v Speaker 1>Transition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe my favorite of all time.</v>

72
00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.810
<v Speaker 1>Sherlock awakes from his reverie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It goes like this.</v>

73
00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.590
<v Speaker 1>Sherlock realizes where he is in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>middle of a busy street,</v>

74
00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.080
<v Speaker 1>a man yells at him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reverse shot,</v>

75
00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:31.850
<v Speaker 1>sherlock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reverse shot.</v>

76
00:04:31.851 --> 00:04:36.680
<v Speaker 1>That man is now his drug dealing friend </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the street reverse shot,</v>

77
00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.240
<v Speaker 1>sherlock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reverse shot.</v>

78
00:04:38.241 --> 00:04:42.020
<v Speaker 1>His drug dealing friend is actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking to him from Baker Street.</v>

79
00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:43.213
<v Speaker 1>Reverse shot sherlock still outside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reverse shot drug dealer telling him </v>

80
00:04:46.881 --> 00:04:50.390
<v Speaker 1>that he's actually at Baker street to </v>
<v Speaker 1>reverse shot.</v>

81
00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.900
<v Speaker 1>Cue the best location,</v>
<v Speaker 1>transition effort.</v>

82
00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:02.350
<v Speaker 1>Now let's watch that in real time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing?</v>

83
00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.700
<v Speaker 1>What were you doing in the middle of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bloody street?</v>

84
00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:16.400
<v Speaker 1>Baker Street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So will you.</v>

85
00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:20.040
<v Speaker 4>It's</v>

86
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.873
<v Speaker 1>hard to imagine a scenario where more </v>
<v Speaker 1>could be accomplished with 10 shots and </v>

87
00:05:25.591 --> 00:05:28.590
<v Speaker 1>sherlock's mind catches up with itself </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he grapples with the thought of just</v>

88
00:05:28.591 --> 00:05:29.424
<v Speaker 1>how many serial killers might be hiding </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind wealth and fame like Culverton </v>

89
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.530
<v Speaker 1>Smith,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the revelation,</v>

90
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.560
<v Speaker 1>the drugs and the sequence reach their </v>
<v Speaker 1>crescendo with the set itself turning on</v>

91
00:05:40.261 --> 00:05:41.094
<v Speaker 1>its axis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's important I think to remember that </v>

92
00:05:42.901 --> 00:05:43.734
<v Speaker 1>what we've seen here has taken place in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the span of only three minutes and 42 </v>

93
00:05:48.421 --> 00:05:49.254
<v Speaker 1>seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there are full movies with fewer </v>

94
00:05:51.811 --> 00:05:55.140
<v Speaker 1>original ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no CGI in the sequence,</v>

95
00:05:55.141 --> 00:05:58.430
<v Speaker 1>no digital fireworks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is just filmmaking,</v>

96
00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:59.293
<v Speaker 1>just the laws of editing embodied </v>
<v Speaker 1>brilliantly as the workings of an </v>

97
00:06:03.741 --> 00:06:04.760
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary mind.</v>

98
00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:14.363
<v Speaker 1>So the nerdwriter crossed a million </v>
<v Speaker 1>subscribers last week and that is the </v>

99
00:06:18.091 --> 00:06:20.910
<v Speaker 1>biggest professional milestone in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

100
00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:21.803
<v Speaker 1>In 2017,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to make a show that lives up to </v>

101
00:06:24.091 --> 00:06:25.710
<v Speaker 1>the amount of people who are watching </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

102
00:06:25.711 --> 00:06:27.630
<v Speaker 1>I hope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you tell people about the show,</v>

103
00:06:27.631 --> 00:06:32.460
<v Speaker 1>you say it something that you've never </v>
<v Speaker 1>seen on youtube or TV or anywhere.</v>

104
00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:33.473
<v Speaker 1>That's the vision I have in my head and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm always thinking about </v>

105
00:06:35.941 --> 00:06:38.610
<v Speaker 1>when I'm making new episodes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so thank you for watching.</v>
