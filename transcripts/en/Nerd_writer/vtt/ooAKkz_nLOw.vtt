1
00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:05.600
<v Speaker 1>Coffee on Tuesday and block six.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to figure out what I should</v>

2
00:00:14.891 --> 00:00:15.724
<v Speaker 1>do for my next blog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I went upstairs and talked to my </v>

3
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.510
<v Speaker 1>neighbors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>told me he's been dying to go to the big</v>

4
00:00:19.511 --> 00:00:22.360
<v Speaker 1>scientology complex on sunset boulevard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>

5
00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:23.403
<v Speaker 1>perfect</v>

6
00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.950
<v Speaker 2>with scientology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here it is.</v>

7
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:43.100
<v Speaker 2>Church of Scientology.</v>

8
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:47.603
<v Speaker 1>He didn't let us take the camera inside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'll just tell you what happened </v>

9
00:00:49.831 --> 00:00:50.664
<v Speaker 1>next.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were greeted by a receptionist who </v>

10
00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:54.060
<v Speaker 1>looked like he was 19 years old and </v>
<v Speaker 1>looked us straight in the eye.</v>

11
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.100
<v Speaker 1>Everybody in that building looks you </v>
<v Speaker 1>straight in the eye.</v>

12
00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.023
<v Speaker 1>The first thing he did was pushed </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward a piece of paper on what you </v>

13
00:00:58.231 --> 00:00:59.940
<v Speaker 1>were supposed to write,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our first name or last name,</v>

14
00:00:59.941 --> 00:01:01.110
<v Speaker 1>our address,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our phone number,</v>

15
00:01:01.111 --> 00:01:01.944
<v Speaker 1>and the reason why we were coming here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we said that we were interested in the </v>

16
00:01:04.021 --> 00:01:05.850
<v Speaker 1>religion and that we wanted to know more</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

17
00:01:05.851 --> 00:01:09.120
<v Speaker 1>So he suggested that we take the self </v>
<v Speaker 1>guided multimedia tour.</v>

18
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.380
<v Speaker 3>This is an invitation to freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man can save his soul.</v>

19
00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.213
<v Speaker 1>So in the back part of the lobbyists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these interactive tvs where you can </v>

20
00:01:23.321 --> 00:01:24.154
<v Speaker 1>watch different aspects of scientology </v>
<v Speaker 1>and move your way around and learn all </v>

21
00:01:27.911 --> 00:01:28.744
<v Speaker 1>different types of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got these two sample dvds first the </v>

22
00:01:31.001 --> 00:01:35.920
<v Speaker 1>way to happiness and seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientology and overview.</v>

23
00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:36.783
<v Speaker 1>There was a booth on scientology ethics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a booth on the evil of </v>

24
00:01:38.951 --> 00:01:41.380
<v Speaker 1>psychiatry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never agreed with psychiatry</v>

25
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:42.493
<v Speaker 3>ever</v>

26
00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.330
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a scientologist.</v>

27
00:01:46.331 --> 00:01:47.164
<v Speaker 2>I never agreed with psychiatry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when I started studying the </v>

28
00:01:48.791 --> 00:01:49.624
<v Speaker 2>history of psychiatry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started realizing more and more why I </v>

29
00:01:51.491 --> 00:01:52.740
<v Speaker 2>didn't agree with psychiatry.</v>

30
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:53.603
<v Speaker 1>There was a booth that started to </v>
<v Speaker 1>explain that the loss of p of </v>

31
00:01:55.141 --> 00:01:55.974
<v Speaker 1>scientology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a booth all about l Ron </v>

32
00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.043
<v Speaker 1>Hubbard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was even a booth where you could </v>

33
00:01:58.741 --> 00:01:59.574
<v Speaker 1>see your own thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is the device that you used to do that </v>

34
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.590
<v Speaker 1>looks like an old toy telephone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After the self guided multimedia tour,</v>

35
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.380
<v Speaker 1>we went up front and asked to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality tests.</v>

36
00:02:10.381 --> 00:02:11.214
<v Speaker 1>So I think me and Zee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that it would be like a 10 to </v>

37
00:02:12.601 --> 00:02:14.970
<v Speaker 1>20 question test,</v>
<v Speaker 1>200 questions.</v>

38
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.983
<v Speaker 1>Some of the questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where do you feel ill at ease in the </v>

39
00:02:17.911 --> 00:02:20.100
<v Speaker 1>company of children?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you whistle while you work?</v>

40
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.020
<v Speaker 1>If a 10 year old was acting out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>

41
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.303
<v Speaker 1>you would approve corporal punishment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You find yourself dwelling on past </v>

42
00:02:25.531 --> 00:02:26.364
<v Speaker 1>misfortunes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You rarely think about past failure </v>

43
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.500
<v Speaker 1>during the type of person who's always </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about what you could've done.</v>

44
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.470
<v Speaker 1>Does it sometimes feel that all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality is a dream?</v>

45
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.270
<v Speaker 1>Finally a question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hundred 92,</v>

46
00:02:36.271 --> 00:02:37.104
<v Speaker 1>they asked the question that they had </v>
<v Speaker 1>been asking over and over in so many </v>

47
00:02:39.691 --> 00:02:41.640
<v Speaker 1>different ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you depressed?</v>

48
00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:42.990
<v Speaker 2>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

49
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.580
<v Speaker 2>very easy to see how if you are </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotionally distressed state bank,</v>

50
00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.900
<v Speaker 2>a cow capture you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big old fucking that on you.</v>

51
00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:52.080
<v Speaker 2>For</v>

52
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.913
<v Speaker 1>someone who is depressed or who just </v>
<v Speaker 1>feels particularly empty for someone </v>

53
00:02:55.711 --> 00:02:59.410
<v Speaker 1>who's tried psychology and psychiatry </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it hasn't for them,</v>

54
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.050
<v Speaker 1>why not adopt the idea that psychiatry </v>
<v Speaker 1>is actually evil?</v>

55
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.913
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it's easy for us when we're in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a vulnerable position to take the exact </v>

56
00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.370
<v Speaker 1>opposite stance of the stance that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>had before when really the answer is not</v>

57
00:03:09.371 --> 00:03:10.204
<v Speaker 1>to flip your ideas 180 degrees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but only to adjust it a little bit him </v>

58
00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:14.920
<v Speaker 1>either way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but anyway,</v>

59
00:03:14.921 --> 00:03:15.754
<v Speaker 1>in five minutes the receptionist </v>
<v Speaker 1>returned with the result of our </v>

60
00:03:17.651 --> 00:03:19.000
<v Speaker 1>personality tests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here it is.</v>

61
00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:21.070
<v Speaker 1>You can see that it's a line graph </v>
<v Speaker 1>showing where it is.</v>

62
00:03:21.071 --> 00:03:24.880
<v Speaker 1>You are in between the spectrum of </v>
<v Speaker 1>several different traits.</v>

63
00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.290
<v Speaker 1>The young scientologist said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

64
00:03:26.291 --> 00:03:28.300
<v Speaker 1>sir,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not our opinion of you.</v>

65
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.690
<v Speaker 1>This is a scientific analysis of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>opinion of yourself.</v>

66
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:32.553
<v Speaker 1>So we went over the results and he asked</v>
<v Speaker 1>me a lot of questions which I tried to </v>

67
00:03:34.331 --> 00:03:36.760
<v Speaker 1>answer as honestly as I could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a big deal was made.</v>

68
00:03:36.761 --> 00:03:39.520
<v Speaker 1>All the while about how practical </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientology is.</v>

69
00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:40.383
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first step that you take after you </v>

70
00:03:41.321 --> 00:03:44.770
<v Speaker 1>take the personality test is a series of</v>
<v Speaker 1>communication courses.</v>

71
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:45.633
<v Speaker 1>In those courses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're meant to unlearn the ways that </v>

72
00:03:47.171 --> 00:03:49.960
<v Speaker 1>we've learned to imperfectness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate with each other,</v>

73
00:03:49.961 --> 00:03:50.794
<v Speaker 1>and I talked to a few scientologists </v>
<v Speaker 1>there who all said that after those </v>

74
00:03:53.021 --> 00:03:53.854
<v Speaker 1>courses they really learn to open up </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves to communication and I </v>

75
00:03:57.101 --> 00:03:57.934
<v Speaker 1>believe that it works for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although it may be the clue to why they </v>

76
00:03:59.231 --> 00:04:00.640
<v Speaker 1>all seem a little bit brainwashed.</v>

77
00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.860
<v Speaker 4>They're all learning communication in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>way that makes them act the way they do.</v>

78
00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:09.000
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

79
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.833
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I assume the communications courses and </v>

80
00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.180
<v Speaker 4>other courses that you have to take our </v>
<v Speaker 4>very specific.</v>

81
00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.470
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next step is purification.</v>

82
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:17.333
<v Speaker 1>So I asked them what purification was </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking that it would be just a bunch </v>

83
00:04:18.871 --> 00:04:20.970
<v Speaker 1>of people sitting in a room trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>think away the toxins.</v>

84
00:04:20.971 --> 00:04:21.804
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually we have a few large Saunas and </v>

85
00:04:22.921 --> 00:04:23.754
<v Speaker 1>the facility and you sit in them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sweat out all the toxins and the next </v>

86
00:04:27.841 --> 00:04:30.210
<v Speaker 1>thing after that is the beginning of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bridge to total freedom.</v>

87
00:04:30.211 --> 00:04:32.550
<v Speaker 1>So here's where I had the question that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I really wanted to ask,</v>

88
00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:33.443
<v Speaker 1>and that was where does the practical </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost utilitarian side of scientology </v>

89
00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.600
<v Speaker 1>come into contact with the religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>side?</v>

90
00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:43.493
<v Speaker 1>He couldn't answer that question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I had to be taken to a new </v>

91
00:04:44.971 --> 00:04:45.804
<v Speaker 1>scientologists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we walked over to another desk and I </v>

92
00:04:47.101 --> 00:04:49.080
<v Speaker 1>sat down and I asked the same question </v>
<v Speaker 1>but a little bit,</v>

93
00:04:49.081 --> 00:04:50.940
<v Speaker 1>frank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or what do you worship here?</v>

94
00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.380
<v Speaker 1>Because Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

95
00:04:52.381 --> 00:04:57.381
<v Speaker 1>has got the Bible and Jesus and this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the infallible words of their religion.</v>

96
00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:58.283
<v Speaker 1>Now the second scientologists took the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tack that there is no worship going on </v>

97
00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:02.993
<v Speaker 1>in scientology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I don't know if I really believe </v>

98
00:05:04.301 --> 00:05:05.880
<v Speaker 1>them on that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but taking him at his word.</v>

99
00:05:05.881 --> 00:05:06.714
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then why do you call yourselves a </v>

100
00:05:09.301 --> 00:05:10.140
<v Speaker 1>religion?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

101
00:05:10.141 --> 00:05:10.501
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

102
00:05:10.501 --> 00:05:12.600
<v Speaker 1>the word religion has been usurped over </v>
<v Speaker 1>the years.</v>

103
00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:13.411
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

104
00:05:13.411 --> 00:05:15.300
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the religious people have had it for</v>

105
00:05:15.301 --> 00:05:17.160
<v Speaker 1>a good 2000 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's,</v>

106
00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.260
<v Speaker 1>let's just give it to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said to him,</v>

107
00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:20.123
<v Speaker 1>I think you're alienating people by </v>
<v Speaker 1>calling it a religion if all it really </v>

108
00:05:23.011 --> 00:05:26.670
<v Speaker 1>is is a self help community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately that's when I had to leave</v>

109
00:05:26.671 --> 00:05:28.680
<v Speaker 1>because the building was closing and my </v>
<v Speaker 1>neighbors,</v>

110
00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:29.970
<v Speaker 1>he had had to get back to our house.</v>

111
00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.923
<v Speaker 2>So what did you think was interesting?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know about their volunteer </v>

112
00:05:39.031 --> 00:05:44.031
<v Speaker 2>efforts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She made a big push about religion.</v>

113
00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:48.000
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they know differ that much.</v>

114
00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.313
<v Speaker 2>They ask you to be good to other people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm sure behind closed doors swing </v>

115
00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.850
<v Speaker 2>basically segregate people and</v>

116
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.930
<v Speaker 1>always put up walls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what I really believe about</v>

117
00:06:02.931 --> 00:06:03.764
<v Speaker 1>scientology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what I think goes on in </v>

118
00:06:05.001 --> 00:06:06.890
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where the money comes from.</v>

119
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:09.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't know any of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To us on the outside looking in.</v>

120
00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:14.360
<v Speaker 1>Scientology is like a frog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't see past the doors,</v>

121
00:06:14.361 --> 00:06:15.194
<v Speaker 1>but I recommend anybody who's interested</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go there because they will give you </v>

122
00:06:17.901 --> 00:06:18.734
<v Speaker 1>certain answers to certain questions and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can learn at least a little bit </v>

123
00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:25.400
<v Speaker 1>about the mystery that is scientology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make your decisions on it for yourself,</v>

124
00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.670
<v Speaker 1>but just remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give a fake name.</v>
