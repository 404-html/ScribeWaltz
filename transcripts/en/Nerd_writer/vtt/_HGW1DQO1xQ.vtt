1
00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:05.980
<v Speaker 1>So you're in a museum looking at </v>
<v Speaker 1>Picasso,</v>

2
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.630
<v Speaker 1>you've heard the name a million times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the influence,</v>

3
00:00:08.631 --> 00:00:09.464
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's one of the most important artists </v>

4
00:00:10.491 --> 00:00:11.870
<v Speaker 1>of the 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.490
<v Speaker 1>he invented cubism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6
00:00:13.491 --> 00:00:15.230
<v Speaker 1>he loved women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of women,</v>

7
00:00:15.231 --> 00:00:16.820
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't that great to them.</v>

8
00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.230
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had phases,</v>

9
00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:19.910
<v Speaker 1>the blue period,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rose period,</v>

10
00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.650
<v Speaker 1>neoclassicism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So realism,</v>

11
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.120
<v Speaker 1>but the painting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at,</v>

12
00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.200
<v Speaker 1>the one in front of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've never seen it before,</v>

13
00:00:25.201 --> 00:00:28.400
<v Speaker 1>and it's called night fishing at </v>
<v Speaker 1>antibodies or on tv,</v>

14
00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.590
<v Speaker 1>you don't really know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't speak French,</v>

15
00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:32.720
<v Speaker 1>a little card next to it doesn't say </v>
<v Speaker 1>much,</v>

16
00:00:32.721 --> 00:00:34.970
<v Speaker 1>but you want to know more about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How?</v>

17
00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:37.603
<v Speaker 1>The way I see it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can look at any Picasso in five </v>

18
00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.430
<v Speaker 1>different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first and often,</v>

19
00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.820
<v Speaker 1>the best way to understand any painting </v>
<v Speaker 1>is simply to look at it.</v>

20
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.110
<v Speaker 1>Describe to yourself the objects and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>actions that you see the night fishing.</v>

21
00:00:51.111 --> 00:00:53.930
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you see as to spear fisherman,</v>

22
00:00:53.931 --> 00:00:57.920
<v Speaker 1>hunting for fish from a small boat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but by a mesmerizing light at the top of</v>

23
00:00:57.921 --> 00:00:58.754
<v Speaker 1>the canvas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One fisherman leans strongly into the </v>

24
00:01:00.561 --> 00:01:04.490
<v Speaker 1>water with his spear hesitating before </v>
<v Speaker 1>delivering the final blow to a fish.</v>

25
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.660
<v Speaker 1>All the other liens languidly over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>edge looking anxious.</v>

26
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.210
<v Speaker 1>The fishing line tied to his foot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the upper left,</v>

27
00:01:11.211 --> 00:01:12.044
<v Speaker 1>we can see two towers and a massive </v>
<v Speaker 1>purple shape swell around the fisherman </v>

28
00:01:15.291 --> 00:01:17.930
<v Speaker 1>fly moths or insect slipped by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>light,</v>

29
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.500
<v Speaker 1>curving over the back of one of them </v>
<v Speaker 1>toward the right side of the frame where</v>

30
00:01:21.501 --> 00:01:24.710
<v Speaker 1>two women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one with an ice cream cone and a bicycle</v>

31
00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.740
<v Speaker 1>gesture to the men who don't seem to </v>
<v Speaker 1>notice that much.</v>

32
00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.480
<v Speaker 1>I find my first reactions to this entire</v>
<v Speaker 1>painting to be a bit contradictory.</v>

33
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:33.373
<v Speaker 1>On the one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there seems to be a violent foreboding </v>

34
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.983
<v Speaker 1>character to the scene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The central focus is clearly the hand </v>

35
00:01:38.571 --> 00:01:39.404
<v Speaker 1>and the spear and the fish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there also seems to be an </v>

36
00:01:41.811 --> 00:01:42.644
<v Speaker 1>equilibrium here in the balance of </v>
<v Speaker 1>colors and figures and almost magical </v>

37
00:01:46.221 --> 00:01:51.020
<v Speaker 1>view into an all too ordinary activity </v>
<v Speaker 1>of fishing at night by lamplight.</v>

38
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.960
<v Speaker 1>And that brings us to the second way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>examine this painting.</v>

39
00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.690
<v Speaker 1>Understanding the actual content of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>scene.</v>

40
00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.150
<v Speaker 1>It is of course a night fishing seen in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that light.</v>

41
00:01:59.151 --> 00:02:02.420
<v Speaker 1>At the top is either the moon or an </v>
<v Speaker 1>acetylene gas lamp,</v>

42
00:02:02.421 --> 00:02:06.110
<v Speaker 1>which spear fisherman use to fish to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>surface of the water.</v>

43
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.720
<v Speaker 1>You can see another one under the boat </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the upper left.</v>

44
00:02:08.721 --> 00:02:09.554
<v Speaker 1>We can bet that those two towers in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>massive purple shapes are the Chateau </v>

45
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.023
<v Speaker 1>Grimaldi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which by the way has since become a </v>

46
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.480
<v Speaker 1>Picasso Museum and the water is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>French Riviera at Auntie,</v>

47
00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.393
<v Speaker 1>but resort town in the southeast of </v>
<v Speaker 1>France where Picasso was vacationing in </v>

48
00:02:23.421 --> 00:02:25.160
<v Speaker 1>the summer of 1939.</v>

49
00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:26.293
<v Speaker 1>According to his secretary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Picasso had come across such fishing </v>

50
00:02:28.551 --> 00:02:29.384
<v Speaker 1>scenes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>walking the town at night after dinner </v>

51
00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.023
<v Speaker 1>and proceeded to lock himself in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>studio to work on this really large </v>

52
00:02:35.361 --> 00:02:37.730
<v Speaker 1>canvases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>largest since Garren Aca,</v>

53
00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.760
<v Speaker 1>which was completed two years before the</v>
<v Speaker 1>form of night fishing is in keeping with</v>

54
00:02:43.071 --> 00:02:46.010
<v Speaker 1>Picasso's evolving style after Garren </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hca,</v>

55
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.023
<v Speaker 1>which incorporates hold over elements </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the cubist period and the flatness </v>

56
00:02:50.451 --> 00:02:53.240
<v Speaker 1>of the canvas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's emphasis on geometrical shapes,</v>

57
00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:54.403
<v Speaker 1>but it also pulls from the painters </v>
<v Speaker 1>excursions into both surrealism and </v>

58
00:02:57.531 --> 00:02:58.364
<v Speaker 1>primitivism where basis become masks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indeed and so much of this painting in </v>

59
00:03:02.861 --> 00:03:03.694
<v Speaker 1>the cubist period and beyond,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the key point to remember is that </v>

60
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.353
<v Speaker 1>figures are painted not as their </v>
<v Speaker 1>perceived but as they're conceived </v>

61
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.933
<v Speaker 1>because so ads to each body elements </v>
<v Speaker 1>that signify to other bodies and to the </v>

62
00:03:17.711 --> 00:03:19.870
<v Speaker 1>canvas as a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and for this reason,</v>

63
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:20.733
<v Speaker 1>the critic Douglas Morgan is right to </v>
<v Speaker 1>say that we can't call Picasso's people </v>

64
00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.360
<v Speaker 1>distorted or grotesque because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't been distorted from anything.</v>

65
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.060
<v Speaker 1>There's no version of reality in which </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're undistorted in night fishing,</v>

66
00:03:34.061 --> 00:03:34.894
<v Speaker 1>that people are not meant to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>sympathized with the normal reaction to </v>

67
00:03:38.321 --> 00:03:42.730
<v Speaker 1>a undistorted figure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're meant to be seen that naked.</v>

68
00:03:42.731 --> 00:03:43.564
<v Speaker 1>Seeing that discernment communicates his</v>
<v Speaker 1>meanings more directly and what are </v>

69
00:03:47.921 --> 00:03:49.450
<v Speaker 1>those meetings?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

70
00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:50.343
<v Speaker 1>there are a couple ways we can apply </v>
<v Speaker 1>what we see in form and content to find </v>

71
00:03:53.861 --> 00:03:55.060
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>

72
00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.940
<v Speaker 1>it's worth it to look at the historical </v>
<v Speaker 1>context.</v>

73
00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:00.850
<v Speaker 1>The painting was completed in August </v>
<v Speaker 1>1939,</v>

74
00:04:00.851 --> 00:04:04.000
<v Speaker 1>just a couple weeks before the outbreak </v>
<v Speaker 1>of world war.</v>

75
00:04:04.001 --> 00:04:07.570
<v Speaker 1>Two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Life in Europe was extraordinarily tense</v>

76
00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:08.673
<v Speaker 1>and it was exceptionally so for Picasso </v>
<v Speaker 1>who is still reeling from the sad </v>

77
00:04:11.621 --> 00:04:14.770
<v Speaker 1>conclusion of another conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Spanish civil war,</v>

78
00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:15.663
<v Speaker 1>and the defeat of the Republican forces </v>
<v Speaker 1>by Francisco Franco and his Nationalist </v>

79
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.500
<v Speaker 1>Army Picasso opposed Franco in his work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most notably in Guernica,</v>

80
00:04:23.501 --> 00:04:27.850
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the most startling </v>
<v Speaker 1>antiwar paintings in history and in some</v>

81
00:04:27.851 --> 00:04:28.684
<v Speaker 1>ways night fishing and can be seen as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>companion piece to guarantee instead of </v>

82
00:04:32.681 --> 00:04:37.681
<v Speaker 1>depicting all the violence of the former</v>
<v Speaker 1>Picasso shows a moment of hesitation.</v>

83
00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.853
<v Speaker 1>The spear is likely to skewer the fish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it hasn't yet a moment of choice </v>

84
00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.490
<v Speaker 1>opens up and with choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is hope.</v>

85
00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:48.940
<v Speaker 1>The painter draws attention to this by </v>
<v Speaker 1>making the hand gripping the spear,</v>

86
00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.490
<v Speaker 1>the most realistic depiction in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>canvas,</v>

87
00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.980
<v Speaker 1>and as we move outward from that focal </v>
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>

88
00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.480
<v Speaker 1>things become increasingly warped and </v>
<v Speaker 1>yet even with this hesitation,</v>

89
00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:02.860
<v Speaker 1>the scene is suffused with a sense of </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost apocalyptic apprehension.</v>

90
00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:03.993
<v Speaker 1>The light at the top resembles a </v>
<v Speaker 1>spiraling comment as much as it does a </v>

91
00:05:06.821 --> 00:05:10.720
<v Speaker 1>moon or a lamp juxtaposed next to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>frightening blotch of read.</v>

92
00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:11.583
<v Speaker 1>The paintings only use of that color.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The moths are like portents buzzing </v>

93
00:05:14.681 --> 00:05:15.514
<v Speaker 1>around the heads of the fishermen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the jetty that the women stand on his </v>

94
00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.440
<v Speaker 1>unsteady,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the town in the background is a mess.</v>

95
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:21.633
<v Speaker 1>These feelings could be oppression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imaging of the coming destruction of </v>

96
00:05:25.091 --> 00:05:25.924
<v Speaker 1>Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certainly the feeling in the air was </v>

97
00:05:27.401 --> 00:05:28.234
<v Speaker 1>hard to miss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but more likely these dark undertones </v>

98
00:05:30.521 --> 00:05:31.354
<v Speaker 1>reflect an ongoing personal struggle </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the loss of Picasso's native Spain </v>

99
00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:36.153
<v Speaker 1>to a vicious dictator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're still missing one giant piece </v>

100
00:05:39.101 --> 00:05:41.380
<v Speaker 1>of the puzzle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the personal context,</v>

101
00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.740
<v Speaker 1>what was going on in the artist's own </v>
<v Speaker 1>life in this respect,</v>

102
00:05:44.741 --> 00:05:47.680
<v Speaker 1>it's worth it to ask who these people </v>
<v Speaker 1>could possibly represent.</v>

103
00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:48.903
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's look at the women while they both </v>

104
00:05:49.901 --> 00:05:51.910
<v Speaker 1>seek to get the attention of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fishermen.</v>

105
00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:52.753
<v Speaker 1>They do so in different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one closest to them and in the </v>

106
00:05:55.361 --> 00:05:59.600
<v Speaker 1>closest proximity to the light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spreads her arms in a graceful pose.</v>

107
00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.390
<v Speaker 1>The other is more blahzay licking her </v>
<v Speaker 1>ice cream cone.</v>

108
00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:03.673
<v Speaker 1>Her obviously really very obviously </v>
<v Speaker 1>phallic head and pronounced breasts </v>

109
00:06:06.891 --> 00:06:07.724
<v Speaker 1>makes her the more sensuous of the two </v>
<v Speaker 1>and those certainly a massage artistic </v>

110
00:06:10.791 --> 00:06:11.624
<v Speaker 1>distinction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These two women likely represent </v>

111
00:06:12.771 --> 00:06:14.210
<v Speaker 1>Picasso's wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Olga,</v>

112
00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:17.480
<v Speaker 1>and the combination of his mistresses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maria Theresa Walter,</v>

113
00:06:17.481 --> 00:06:18.314
<v Speaker 1>and Dora Maar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was with Picasso in on team and </v>

114
00:06:21.111 --> 00:06:21.944
<v Speaker 1>finally the spearing fishermen can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>read as Picasso himself or perhaps the </v>

115
00:06:26.481 --> 00:06:29.420
<v Speaker 1>version of himself that he wants to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>headstrong,</v>

116
00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:32.930
<v Speaker 1>looking forward at his goals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>undaunted by distraction,</v>

117
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:36.410
<v Speaker 1>but this man seems to be linked with his</v>
<v Speaker 1>partner,</v>

118
00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:37.303
<v Speaker 1>perhaps Picasso's other half a side of </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself that is passive that ties a </v>

119
00:06:41.181 --> 00:06:43.370
<v Speaker 1>fishing line to his toe and weights.</v>

120
00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:47.360
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the first fisherman is defined </v>
<v Speaker 1>by strong perpendicular lines.</v>

121
00:06:47.361 --> 00:06:51.470
<v Speaker 1>The second body is a mass of curved </v>
<v Speaker 1>lines and contorted limbs,</v>

122
00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.340
<v Speaker 1>remembering the historical context and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the stark defiance that is.</v>

123
00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:56.243
<v Speaker 1>Guess what we might be seeing here is </v>
<v Speaker 1>Picasso coming to grips not only with </v>

124
00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.890
<v Speaker 1>passivity and weakness in his nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the artists,</v>

125
00:07:03.891 --> 00:07:06.800
<v Speaker 1>impotence in the face of the world's </v>
<v Speaker 1>brutality.</v>

126
00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:11.300
<v Speaker 1>His mother had died at the start of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>year in Spain was lost.</v>

127
00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:16.370
<v Speaker 1>Maybe this is why the boat floats in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>weird no man's land between the town and</v>

128
00:07:16.371 --> 00:07:19.760
<v Speaker 1>the women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe this is why the scene feels uneasy</v>

129
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:22.310
<v Speaker 1>despite being beautiful in its </v>
<v Speaker 1>rendering.</v>

130
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:26.840
<v Speaker 1>There's more you can read into this </v>
<v Speaker 1>painting and the rest of Picasso's work,</v>

131
00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:28.093
<v Speaker 1>but these five angles always start me </v>
<v Speaker 1>down some fruitful paths and each </v>

132
00:07:31.641 --> 00:07:35.450
<v Speaker 1>individual method of understanding is </v>
<v Speaker 1>less important than the ways all of them</v>

133
00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.313
<v Speaker 1>connect and feed into each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The historical context usually informs </v>

134
00:07:39.471 --> 00:07:41.900
<v Speaker 1>the personal and the form grows out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the content,</v>

135
00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:45.110
<v Speaker 1>and your first reaction is often </v>
<v Speaker 1>surprisingly incisive.</v>

136
00:07:45.111 --> 00:07:47.390
<v Speaker 1>If you take the time to voice it or </v>
<v Speaker 1>write it down,</v>

137
00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:48.763
<v Speaker 1>Picasso's legacy looms so large that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>scholarship on him is fast and often </v>

138
00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:54.403
<v Speaker 1>contradictory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my feeling is why not decide the </v>

139
00:07:57.681 --> 00:08:00.200
<v Speaker 1>significance of his work for yourself.</v>
