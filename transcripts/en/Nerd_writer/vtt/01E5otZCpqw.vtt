00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:26.253
<v Speaker 1>When I write these film analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I usually start by watching the film </v>

2
00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.130
<v Speaker 1>with a notepad and writing down all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things I think are interesting.</v>

3
00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.790
<v Speaker 1>When I started watching long car wise in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mood for love,</v>

4
00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.983
<v Speaker 1>the first thing I wrote was five minutes</v>
<v Speaker 1>in and every shot is a frame within a </v>

5
00:00:43.421 --> 00:00:44.254
<v Speaker 1>frame,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning that every single shot feature </v>

6
00:00:46.301 --> 00:00:50.770
<v Speaker 1>characters not only framed by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rectangle of the film itself,</v>

7
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.633
<v Speaker 1>but by smaller internal shapes as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is the visual technique that </v>

8
00:00:55.631 --> 00:00:56.464
<v Speaker 1>filmmakers have used for decades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My favorite example is the great last </v>

9
00:01:00.251 --> 00:01:03.250
<v Speaker 1>shot and John Ford's masterpiece,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the searchers,</v>

10
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.080
<v Speaker 1>but seldom is it used so ubiquitously as</v>
<v Speaker 1>the film went on.</v>

11
00:01:08.081 --> 00:01:12.040
<v Speaker 1>I had to cross out five from my little </v>
<v Speaker 1>note and change it to six,</v>

12
00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.300
<v Speaker 1>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine.</v>

13
00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:14.403
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't until minute 12 that I saw the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first shot without some foreground </v>

14
00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:18.940
<v Speaker 1>obstruction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This shot,</v>

15
00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.060
<v Speaker 1>which crucially doesn't feature either </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the two main characters,</v>

16
00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.313
<v Speaker 1>but wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting ahead of myself in the mood </v>

17
00:01:24.881 --> 00:01:25.714
<v Speaker 1>for love is the story of two married </v>
<v Speaker 1>couples who happened to rent rooms in </v>

18
00:01:29.321 --> 00:01:32.710
<v Speaker 1>the adjacent homes of older couples in </v>
<v Speaker 1>19 sixties.</v>

19
00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:33.543
<v Speaker 1>Hong Kong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The film focuses on the husband of one </v>

20
00:01:35.681 --> 00:01:38.410
<v Speaker 1>couple Mr Chow and the wife of the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mrs.</v>

21
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.333
<v Speaker 1>Chan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as they both gradually discover that </v>

22
00:01:41.081 --> 00:01:41.914
<v Speaker 1>their spouses are cheating on them with </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other and then how those two </v>

23
00:01:45.371 --> 00:01:49.300
<v Speaker 1>innocent victims of infidelity come </v>
<v Speaker 1>together to deal with the pain of that.</v>

24
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.193
<v Speaker 1>The film manages to be unsentimental </v>
<v Speaker 1>with its subject matter while couching </v>

25
00:01:53.891 --> 00:01:57.310
<v Speaker 1>the events in sumptuous painterly </v>
<v Speaker 1>cinematography.</v>

26
00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.330
<v Speaker 1>The narrative skips and jumps forward </v>
<v Speaker 1>through time at an erratic speed,</v>

27
00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:02.463
<v Speaker 1>as one might recall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The story in memory and the viewer is </v>

28
00:02:05.051 --> 00:02:09.700
<v Speaker 1>often left initially confused as to how </v>
<v Speaker 1>much time has passed between scenes.</v>

29
00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.730
<v Speaker 1>This prompts a strong engagement with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the film,</v>

30
00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:13.593
<v Speaker 1>a need to pay attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also reflects how the film was </v>

31
00:02:16.661 --> 00:02:17.494
<v Speaker 1>made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a little more than an outline </v>

32
00:02:18.881 --> 00:02:23.440
<v Speaker 1>when long car why and his crew began </v>
<v Speaker 1>filming a process that took a long,</v>

33
00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:24.573
<v Speaker 1>15 months in which the script and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual scenes were written on the </v>

34
00:02:28.361 --> 00:02:31.390
<v Speaker 1>fly by the director and the actors </v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

35
00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.330
<v Speaker 1>Which is surprising because watching the</v>
<v Speaker 1>film,</v>

36
00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:35.223
<v Speaker 1>you can't help but feel that you're in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the hands of somebody in complete </v>

37
00:02:38.351 --> 00:02:39.184
<v Speaker 1>control visually and emotionally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the mood for love is fully </v>

38
00:02:42.821 --> 00:02:43.654
<v Speaker 1>consistent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the film is so self contained that it </v>

39
00:02:45.581 --> 00:02:46.414
<v Speaker 1>only features a handful of locations </v>
<v Speaker 1>each filmed from the same angle so that </v>

40
00:02:51.131 --> 00:02:56.131
<v Speaker 1>you experience a kind of circular effect</v>
<v Speaker 1>of returning again and again to the same</v>

41
00:02:56.561 --> 00:02:59.830
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This technique far from feeling sluggish</v>

42
00:02:59.831 --> 00:03:04.330
<v Speaker 1>or repetitive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead isolates against fixed backwards</v>

43
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.030
<v Speaker 1>the things that actually are changing in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the film,</v>

44
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:08.223
<v Speaker 1>the inner lives of the two leads and for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most part these inner lives are </v>

45
00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:12.724
<v Speaker 1>explored worthless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The real action of this movie is in </v>

46
00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.720
<v Speaker 1>posture glances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>touches by restricting the language.</v>

47
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:20.583
<v Speaker 1>One car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why echoes the restriction of action </v>

48
00:03:23.201 --> 00:03:26.340
<v Speaker 1>that plagues Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chow and Mrs Chan in 19 sixties,</v>

49
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:27.213
<v Speaker 1>Hong Kong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they are under constant threat of </v>

50
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:30.183
<v Speaker 1>gossip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of surveillance from their </v>

51
00:03:31.961 --> 00:03:36.170
<v Speaker 1>landlords and the community at large,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the CCC,</v>

52
00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.313
<v Speaker 1>but this is one reason why everything is</v>
<v Speaker 1>doubly framed by placing objects in the </v>

53
00:03:44.981 --> 00:03:45.580
<v Speaker 1>foreground.</v>

54
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.450
<v Speaker 1>The director enhances the feeling that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the characters have of being observed,</v>

55
00:03:49.451 --> 00:03:54.451
<v Speaker 1>not to mention our own feelings of being</v>
<v Speaker 1>observers observed and observing,</v>

56
00:03:54.761 --> 00:03:58.390
<v Speaker 1>seen and being seen what we desire from </v>
<v Speaker 1>others,</v>

57
00:03:58.391 --> 00:03:59.224
<v Speaker 1>what others desire from us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are major themes of in the mood </v>

58
00:04:02.411 --> 00:04:03.244
<v Speaker 1>for love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the most extraordinary element </v>

59
00:04:05.351 --> 00:04:06.184
<v Speaker 1>of this film is what's introduced just </v>
<v Speaker 1>after the two main characters admit to </v>

60
00:04:10.121 --> 00:04:10.954
<v Speaker 1>each other that their spouses are </v>
<v Speaker 1>cheating instead of confronting the </v>

61
00:04:14.141 --> 00:04:18.850
<v Speaker 1>situation head on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their primary goal becomes to understand</v>

62
00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:19.743
<v Speaker 1>exactly how it happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we get this incredible scene where </v>

63
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.333
<v Speaker 1>they reenact the seduction of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>spouses in which each attempt to embody </v>

64
00:04:28.871 --> 00:04:29.704
<v Speaker 1>the spouse of the other while being </v>
<v Speaker 1>coached by the other on what they think </v>

65
00:04:33.461 --> 00:04:38.461
<v Speaker 1>the spouse really would or wouldn't do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This makes for a really complex but also</v>

66
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:41.133
<v Speaker 1>kind of perverse interplay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>though the film aggressively focuses on </v>

67
00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:45.550
<v Speaker 1>only Mr.</v>

68
00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:46.473
<v Speaker 1>Chow and Mrs Chan to the point of never </v>
<v Speaker 1>even showing the faces of their spouses </v>

69
00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.580
<v Speaker 1>were always aware that for people not to</v>
<v Speaker 1>are involved here,</v>

70
00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:59.910
<v Speaker 1>but it's not for real people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's two people and two phantoms.</v>

71
00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.570
<v Speaker 1>I think of what's being asked of Chow </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Chan in the seduction scene.</v>

72
00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.360
<v Speaker 1>In the guise of understanding what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>

73
00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:08.403
<v Speaker 1>Each victim attempts to seduce their own</v>
<v Speaker 1>spouse in the form of the other's </v>

74
00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:14.830
<v Speaker 1>spouse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A task.</v>

75
00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.843
<v Speaker 1>It has to be doomed from the start </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the fact of the affair itself </v>

76
00:05:19.091 --> 00:05:19.924
<v Speaker 1>means that neither child nor chan can </v>
<v Speaker 1>any longer elicit that kind of desire </v>

77
00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:28.240
<v Speaker 1>that they're trying to recreate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could describe this course of action</v>

78
00:05:28.241 --> 00:05:29.074
<v Speaker 1>as masochistic and one car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why lets us feel this by not making it </v>

79
00:05:33.191 --> 00:05:34.024
<v Speaker 1>obvious when Mr Chow or Mrs Chan are </v>
<v Speaker 1>being themselves or being each other's </v>

80
00:05:37.981 --> 00:05:40.570
<v Speaker 1>spouses often were admitted into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>scene,</v>

81
00:05:40.571 --> 00:05:41.404
<v Speaker 1>interpreting it one way before the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality or perhaps the unreality of the </v>

82
00:05:45.221 --> 00:05:47.650
<v Speaker 1>moment hits us like a gut punch,</v>

83
00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:55.310
<v Speaker 1>but because each player is constantly </v>
<v Speaker 1>coaching the other,</v>

84
00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:56.383
<v Speaker 1>they're able to construct fantasy in </v>
<v Speaker 1>which they control their own betrayal </v>

85
00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.080
<v Speaker 1>and by never consummating their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>butting love for each other.</v>

86
00:06:06.081 --> 00:06:06.914
<v Speaker 1>Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chow and Mrs Chan can infinitely delay </v>

87
00:06:09.391 --> 00:06:12.860
<v Speaker 1>the moment in which they have to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>things as they really are.</v>

88
00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:13.813
<v Speaker 1>They can stay in their fantasy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a tragic and twisted state of </v>

89
00:06:17.451 --> 00:06:18.284
<v Speaker 1>affairs and one car wide has said that </v>
<v Speaker 1>if Tony Young and Maggie Chung weren't </v>

90
00:06:21.921 --> 00:06:22.754
<v Speaker 1>such beautiful actors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the darkness at the center of their </v>

91
00:06:25.521 --> 00:06:28.820
<v Speaker 1>characters and their fantasy would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>obvious.</v>

92
00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:29.863
<v Speaker 1>Of course they can't keep it up forever </v>
<v Speaker 1>and in the scene where Mr Chow finally </v>

93
00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:38.750
<v Speaker 1>admits his love for Mrs Chin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the fantasy comes crumbling down</v>

94
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:42.050
<v Speaker 1>as he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are like their spouses,</v>

95
00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.260
<v Speaker 1>which means that the thing they've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>refusing to see,</v>

96
00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:46.183
<v Speaker 1>their own lack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they've ceased to be an object of </v>

97
00:06:48.891 --> 00:06:49.724
<v Speaker 1>love for their loved one rushes into </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness like a wave and yet still </v>

98
00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:59.570
<v Speaker 1>they don't act on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can only let the brutal truth in so much</v>

99
00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:01.040
<v Speaker 1>in order to survive.</v>

100
00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.130
<v Speaker 1>In order to move forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr.</v>

101
00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:07.280
<v Speaker 1>Chow and Mrs Chan doom themselves to </v>
<v Speaker 1>missed connections.</v>

102
00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:08.173
<v Speaker 1>This is why at the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the film jumps forward to see them just </v>

103
00:07:10.941 --> 00:07:14.210
<v Speaker 1>missing each other twice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just missing each other.</v>

104
00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:15.073
<v Speaker 1>The mere possibility of a connection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The connection itself is what sustains </v>

105
00:07:19.341 --> 00:07:20.174
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

106
00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:24.350
<v Speaker 1>everybody lives within fantasy within </v>
<v Speaker 1>frames.</v>

107
00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:28.730
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes the frames are made by us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they're made by others.</v>

108
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:32.780
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes we need to believe that those </v>
<v Speaker 1>made by us are made by others,</v>

109
00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:33.913
<v Speaker 1>but whatever the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is no way out of the frame when </v>

110
00:07:37.011 --> 00:07:40.220
<v Speaker 1>fantasies rupture or crack or break down</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely.</v>

111
00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:45.050
<v Speaker 1>That's trauma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like living temporarily in a storm,</v>

112
00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:48.740
<v Speaker 1>one car wise in the mood for love is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>gorgeous,</v>

113
00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:49.873
<v Speaker 1>quiet and painful exploration of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens when the fantasy you create for </v>

114
00:07:54.261 --> 00:07:55.094
<v Speaker 1>yourself is a perverse one when it only </v>
<v Speaker 1>serves to keep you from confronting the </v>

115
00:07:59.271 --> 00:08:00.104
<v Speaker 1>pain and it was created to avoid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason the film is so </v>
