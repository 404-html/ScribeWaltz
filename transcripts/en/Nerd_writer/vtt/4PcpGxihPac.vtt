1
00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:17.863
<v Speaker 1>One of the interesting byproducts of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>digitization of everything is the steep </v>

2
00:00:21.951 --> 00:00:22.784
<v Speaker 1>rise in nostalgia for physicality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a great lecture from the writer </v>

3
00:00:27.171 --> 00:00:28.004
<v Speaker 1>and publisher James Bridle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where he laughs about the fact that </v>

4
00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:31.723
<v Speaker 1>nobody ever really talked about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>smell of books until ebooks started to </v>

5
00:00:36.081 --> 00:00:36.914
<v Speaker 1>threaten their existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden we became nostalgic for </v>

6
00:00:40.081 --> 00:00:40.914
<v Speaker 1>a quality that he never really noticed </v>
<v Speaker 1>before or take the resurgence in vinyl </v>

7
00:00:45.141 --> 00:00:46.310
<v Speaker 1>record sales.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

8
00:00:46.311 --> 00:00:49.700
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely true that the sound </v>
<v Speaker 1>quality of vinyl is amazing.</v>

9
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:50.593
<v Speaker 1>I'd be willing to bet that our </v>
<v Speaker 1>attraction to it also has something to </v>

10
00:00:53.061 --> 00:00:53.894
<v Speaker 1>do with the object itself are a real </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that takes up space in your home </v>

11
00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:58.373
<v Speaker 1>as symbol of the analog world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As more and more of our lives get </v>

12
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.820
<v Speaker 1>vacuumed into the digital realm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're increasingly likely,</v>

13
00:01:04.821 --> 00:01:05.654
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to look for these symbols and be </v>

14
00:01:06.981 --> 00:01:07.814
<v Speaker 1>attracted to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the crazy thing is that these </v>

15
00:01:09.501 --> 00:01:12.710
<v Speaker 1>reminders don't even have to be physical</v>
<v Speaker 1>objects.</v>

16
00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:13.663
<v Speaker 1>All they have to do to tap into that </v>
<v Speaker 1>nostalgia is resemble the traits of </v>

17
00:01:16.641 --> 00:01:17.474
<v Speaker 1>those objects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about instagram filters designed </v>

18
00:01:19.821 --> 00:01:21.860
<v Speaker 1>to look like old cameras and film </v>
<v Speaker 1>stocks.</v>

19
00:01:21.861 --> 00:01:26.861
<v Speaker 1>These filters mimic objects that most </v>
<v Speaker 1>instagram users won't ever touch.</v>

20
00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:28.243
<v Speaker 1>As bridle says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>putting a filter on your digital photo </v>

21
00:01:29.811 --> 00:01:30.644
<v Speaker 1>is an attempt to codify that image as </v>
<v Speaker 1>memory to wrap it up in something solid </v>

22
00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.220
<v Speaker 1>historical that calls back to a time </v>
<v Speaker 1>before everything was fluid and changing</v>

23
00:01:40.221 --> 00:01:42.800
<v Speaker 1>and impossible to hold onto.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this way,</v>

24
00:01:42.801 --> 00:01:46.130
<v Speaker 1>our nostalgia becomes an aesthetic and </v>
<v Speaker 1>in film,</v>

25
00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.400
<v Speaker 1>one of the features of that aesthetic is</v>
<v Speaker 1>green film.</v>

26
00:01:49.401 --> 00:01:50.234
<v Speaker 1>Grain is a texture in process film that </v>
<v Speaker 1>has the appearance of tiny particles </v>

27
00:01:53.421 --> 00:01:54.254
<v Speaker 1>moving around randomly in the image.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The amount of grain has to do with the </v>

28
00:01:57.321 --> 00:01:58.154
<v Speaker 1>speed and size of the film stock and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of light being used during the </v>

29
00:02:01.491 --> 00:02:03.560
<v Speaker 1>era when film was the only choice.</v>

30
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.393
<v Speaker 1>Many photographers and filmmakers tried </v>
<v Speaker 1>hard to eliminate this aspect of film </v>

31
00:02:07.521 --> 00:02:10.010
<v Speaker 1>processing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was always a part of cinema,</v>

32
00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.410
<v Speaker 1>especially in low budget independent </v>
<v Speaker 1>movies.</v>

33
00:02:12.411 --> 00:02:13.244
<v Speaker 1>Using smaller film stocks like 16 </v>
<v Speaker 1>millimeter and without access to big </v>

34
00:02:16.521 --> 00:02:17.354
<v Speaker 1>professional studio lighting these days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's easy to tap into that India </v>

35
00:02:20.891 --> 00:02:22.370
<v Speaker 1>aesthetic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By using grain.</v>

36
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.353
<v Speaker 1>The grain itself is loaded with all </v>
<v Speaker 1>these associations that reached back </v>

37
00:02:26.271 --> 00:02:28.400
<v Speaker 1>into the history of film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question is,</v>

38
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.590
<v Speaker 1>now that grain has its own aesthetic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can that aesthetic be pushed further?</v>

39
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.993
<v Speaker 1>And that brings me to Mandy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second feature film from pandas </v>

40
00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.310
<v Speaker 1>cause mottos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you haven't seen it,</v>

41
00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:41.203
<v Speaker 1>do that right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might still be playing at a local </v>

42
00:02:43.341 --> 00:02:47.150
<v Speaker 1>theater near you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mandy is a revenge horror movie starring</v>

43
00:02:47.151 --> 00:02:47.984
<v Speaker 1>Nicolas Cage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reminiscent of the grindhouse films of </v>

44
00:02:50.271 --> 00:02:52.700
<v Speaker 1>the seventies and eighties when the </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie is set.</v>

45
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.730
<v Speaker 1>It's a simple story as most revenge </v>
<v Speaker 1>movies are,</v>

46
00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.960
<v Speaker 1>but what sets it apart is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychoactive vision and focus of cars.</v>

47
00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.010
<v Speaker 1>Matos who clearly has something very </v>
<v Speaker 1>specific in mind.</v>

48
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.590
<v Speaker 1>Visually movie is dark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grimy,</v>

49
00:03:05.591 --> 00:03:10.240
<v Speaker 1>often saturated with primary colors and </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely awash in grain.</v>

50
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.070
<v Speaker 1>In this way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not unlike cars.</v>

51
00:03:12.071 --> 00:03:14.770
<v Speaker 1>Motto says first feature beyond the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Black Rainbow,</v>

52
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:15.633
<v Speaker 1>which is much more ambiguous plot wise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but interested in exploring the same </v>

53
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.670
<v Speaker 1>visual fetishes for cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mottos,</v>

54
00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.560
<v Speaker 1>it's not just about paying homage to old</v>
<v Speaker 1>films.</v>

55
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:24.603
<v Speaker 1>It's about learning the expressive </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential of existing aesthetics and </v>

56
00:03:27.101 --> 00:03:27.934
<v Speaker 1>stretching their qualities to see what </v>
<v Speaker 1>kinds of feelings and tones they can </v>

57
00:03:30.791 --> 00:03:31.624
<v Speaker 1>evoke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way I look at it now though is I </v>

58
00:03:32.321 --> 00:03:37.321
<v Speaker 1>feel like in the present time has no </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning anymore and so it's.</v>

59
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:39.243
<v Speaker 1>I feel like now choosing an era fear </v>
<v Speaker 1>film is almost like choosing a color </v>

60
00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.053
<v Speaker 1>beyond the black rainbow and Mandy </v>
<v Speaker 1>invite us to consider film grain as a </v>

61
00:03:45.911 --> 00:03:46.744
<v Speaker 1>visual tool like lighting or color,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just a byproduct of chemical </v>

62
00:03:49.841 --> 00:03:50.674
<v Speaker 1>processing.</v>

63
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.873
<v Speaker 1>So what is green feel like and maybe the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most prominent quality of film grain is </v>

64
00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.150
<v Speaker 1>movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The grain is always moving.</v>

65
00:03:58.151 --> 00:04:01.750
<v Speaker 1>It's swimming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means that even in a still life of</v>

66
00:04:01.751 --> 00:04:04.660
<v Speaker 1>let's say a flower on a table that </v>
<v Speaker 1>flowers alive,</v>

67
00:04:04.661 --> 00:04:05.494
<v Speaker 1>even though it's not moving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grain gets inside whatever's in the </v>

68
00:04:07.901 --> 00:04:10.570
<v Speaker 1>frame and imbues it with motion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

69
00:04:10.571 --> 00:04:11.404
<v Speaker 1>this kind of swimming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>breathing movement from within mimics </v>

70
00:04:13.961 --> 00:04:18.190
<v Speaker 1>the visual effects of hallucinogenic </v>
<v Speaker 1>drugs which play a major part in mandate</v>

71
00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:19.413
<v Speaker 1>film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Grain is hypnotic and that adds to the </v>

72
00:04:20.981 --> 00:04:21.814
<v Speaker 1>sense of the film existing in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dreamlike universe or as one horribly </v>

73
00:04:25.541 --> 00:04:29.230
<v Speaker 1>bad acid trip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At times the grain almost has a paranoid</v>

74
00:04:29.231 --> 00:04:32.380
<v Speaker 1>feeling like there's something squirming</v>
<v Speaker 1>under the image.</v>

75
00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.620
<v Speaker 1>Another quality of grain is that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>blends grain,</v>

76
00:04:35.621 --> 00:04:36.454
<v Speaker 1>gives an underlying texture to the frame</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that there is a continuity between </v>

77
00:04:39.851 --> 00:04:41.110
<v Speaker 1>one object and another.</v>

78
00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.153
<v Speaker 1>It gives the impression that the image </v>
<v Speaker 1>is atomized into tiny particles that </v>

79
00:04:45.311 --> 00:04:46.144
<v Speaker 1>could disperse and overlap because most </v>
<v Speaker 1>often mixes heavy grain with smoke to </v>

80
00:04:50.471 --> 00:04:52.840
<v Speaker 1>heighten this effect for the characters </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the viewers.</v>

81
00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.770
<v Speaker 1>Nothing is solid or what it seems things</v>
<v Speaker 1>can shift at a moment's notice.</v>

82
00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.010
<v Speaker 1>In a world that looks like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're always vulnerable,</v>

83
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.903
<v Speaker 1>always at risk of coming apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The most striking example of this is a </v>

84
00:05:04.991 --> 00:05:09.400
<v Speaker 1>scene in the first half of Mandy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mandy herself is kidnapped by a cult and</v>

85
00:05:09.401 --> 00:05:10.234
<v Speaker 1>force fed hallucinogenic drugs cause </v>
<v Speaker 1>mottos turns the dial way up on the </v>

86
00:05:14.081 --> 00:05:14.914
<v Speaker 1>scene by drenching the image in purple </v>
<v Speaker 1>and pink hues and adding a trailing </v>

87
00:05:18.281 --> 00:05:20.530
<v Speaker 1>effect to movement so that when the cult</v>
<v Speaker 1>leader,</v>

88
00:05:20.531 --> 00:05:21.364
<v Speaker 1>Jeremiah sands just stimulates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you actually have this steam of grain </v>

89
00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.940
<v Speaker 1>that falls away from Christ life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then when he kneels down to speak to her</v>

90
00:05:35.091 --> 00:05:35.924
<v Speaker 1>up close,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because mottos actually feeds Mandy's </v>

91
00:05:38.091 --> 00:05:38.924
<v Speaker 1>face into sands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hardly noticeable at first and </v>

92
00:05:41.661 --> 00:05:42.494
<v Speaker 1>that's purposeful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The texture of the image helps this be </v>

93
00:05:44.661 --> 00:05:48.200
<v Speaker 1>so subtle that you're not quite sure if </v>
<v Speaker 1>your mind is playing tricks on you.</v>

94
00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.903
<v Speaker 1>It's important to know that even though </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is cool as hell and something that </v>

95
00:05:54.791 --> 00:05:55.624
<v Speaker 1>film geeks like myself drool over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this effect is not just visual </v>

96
00:05:59.181 --> 00:06:01.280
<v Speaker 1>decoration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It adds to the story.</v>

97
00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.340
<v Speaker 1>Sands is trying to assimilate mandy into</v>
<v Speaker 1>his coat.</v>

98
00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:09.350
<v Speaker 1>As you see her face feed into his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's using the qualities of psychoactive</v>

99
00:06:09.351 --> 00:06:10.184
<v Speaker 1>drugs to loosen Mandy's grip on her own </v>
<v Speaker 1>identity so that he can substitute his </v>

100
00:06:13.761 --> 00:06:17.360
<v Speaker 1>own stuff like this is what gives mandy </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's power.</v>

101
00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.300
<v Speaker 1>It's the aesthetic is not added onto the</v>
<v Speaker 1>film after the fact.</v>

102
00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:21.403
<v Speaker 1>It's a film that literally wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>function if you took those aesthetic </v>

103
00:06:24.711 --> 00:06:25.544
<v Speaker 1>features away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true for its use of film grain </v>

104
00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:30.950
<v Speaker 1>and for all the other visual fireworks </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the movie.</v>

105
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:32.383
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his history becomes nostalgia and </v>

106
00:06:33.651 --> 00:06:34.484
<v Speaker 1>nostalgia becomes aesthetic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A great opportunity is being presented </v>

107
00:06:38.001 --> 00:06:40.410
<v Speaker 1>to new filmmakers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree with cars,</v>

108
00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:43.430
<v Speaker 1>mottos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>time has no meaning anymore.</v>

109
00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:46.940
<v Speaker 1>Every aesthetic of the past is a Palette</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the future.</v>

110
00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:48.133
<v Speaker 1>You can copy and paste those old </v>
<v Speaker 1>aesthetics onto your work or you can </v>

111
00:06:52.041 --> 00:06:52.874
<v Speaker 1>take up the colors with a spirit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>experimentation and have some fucking </v>

112
00:06:56.631 --> 00:06:57.464
<v Speaker 1>fun.</v>

113
00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:14.860
<v Speaker 1>How you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody?</v>

114
00:07:14.861 --> 00:07:15.694
<v Speaker 1>Thank you so much for watching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This episode was brought to you by </v>
