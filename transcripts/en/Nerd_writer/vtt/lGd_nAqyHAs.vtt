00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:06.230
<v Speaker 1>Coffee on a Tuesday in 27.</v>

2
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.180
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you're like me,</v>

3
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.750
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't or it won't be until the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>semester of college.</v>

4
00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:25.130
<v Speaker 1>Undergrad when you really catch the bug </v>
<v Speaker 1>of learning and there must be a thousand</v>

5
00:00:25.131 --> 00:00:25.964
<v Speaker 1>reasons for this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Belated development reasons which are </v>

6
00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:28.303
<v Speaker 1>universal and so forgivable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The most conspicuous being that high </v>

7
00:00:30.861 --> 00:00:35.480
<v Speaker 1>school literally rips it out of you in </v>
<v Speaker 1>favor of a more relevant apparatus.</v>

8
00:00:35.481 --> 00:00:38.660
<v Speaker 1>That is a system for navigating social </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships.</v>

9
00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.450
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a system for how to be cool.</v>

10
00:00:41.451 --> 00:00:43.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm not totally sure that it's a bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

11
00:00:43.011 --> 00:00:43.844
<v Speaker 1>This development of a social aptitude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually think that there is such a </v>

12
00:00:46.581 --> 00:00:47.414
<v Speaker 1>thing as cool and I would define a cool </v>
<v Speaker 1>person as someone who engages others </v>

13
00:00:50.931 --> 00:00:51.764
<v Speaker 1>with their ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone who is receptive enough to </v>

14
00:00:53.571 --> 00:00:54.404
<v Speaker 1>friends and acquaintances and even </v>
<v Speaker 1>strangers to see when the other is </v>

15
00:00:57.261 --> 00:00:59.480
<v Speaker 1>clearly not interested in what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>

16
00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.110
<v Speaker 1>Telling a story that your audience can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly relate to is not cool.</v>

17
00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.930
<v Speaker 1>Boasting is not cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isolation is not cool.</v>

18
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't go in for winners and losers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do go in for.</v>

19
00:01:09.801 --> 00:01:10.310
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

20
00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.940
<v Speaker 1>so there was this one time in eighth </v>
<v Speaker 1>grade when I was acting out in class,</v>

21
00:01:13.941 --> 00:01:17.060
<v Speaker 1>being loud and clownish and stupid and </v>
<v Speaker 1>my teacher,</v>

22
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.013
<v Speaker 1>Mr Leventhal told me to go wait outside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that horrible exile of </v>

23
00:01:21.441 --> 00:01:25.040
<v Speaker 1>secondary school when you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>reprimanded and everybody sees it and it</v>

24
00:01:25.041 --> 00:01:27.110
<v Speaker 1>was even worse because I like this </v>
<v Speaker 1>teacher,</v>

25
00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were supposed to be friends.</v>

26
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.833
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he came out into the hallway with a </v>

27
00:01:30.831 --> 00:01:33.260
<v Speaker 1>conciliatory look and said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Evan,</v>

28
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.660
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you're funny.</v>

29
00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.960
<v Speaker 1>Everyone in that class knows you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>funny,</v>

30
00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:40.513
<v Speaker 1>but being funny doesn't mean a damn </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing if you don't have timing to this </v>

31
00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:46.351
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the best.</v>

32
00:01:46.351 --> 00:01:48.660
<v Speaker 1>Certainly the most influential advice </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've ever gotten.</v>

33
00:01:48.661 --> 00:01:50.130
<v Speaker 1>There's no question that it changed my </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

34
00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.350
<v Speaker 1>Not right away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but good advice never does.</v>

35
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.460
<v Speaker 1>Gradually it sunk down and took hold and</v>
<v Speaker 1>in moments when in the past I would have</v>

36
00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.240
<v Speaker 1>blurted out some thoughtless vulgarity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I instead opted to keep silent,</v>

37
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.280
<v Speaker 1>to listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to feel the waves,</v>

38
00:02:02.281 --> 00:02:03.114
<v Speaker 1>have a conversation and say something or</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell a joke only when the moment was </v>

39
00:02:05.971 --> 00:02:08.700
<v Speaker 1>prime for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot like surfing and surfing.</v>

40
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.890
<v Speaker 1>You're going to wipe out a lot in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>course of getting better.</v>

41
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.980
<v Speaker 1>No matter how good you get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the day will never come when you've said</v>

42
00:02:13.981 --> 00:02:16.410
<v Speaker 1>your last idiotic thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Word of advice.</v>

43
00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:17.453
<v Speaker 1>Don't trust anyone who never makes a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fool of him or herself because that </v>

44
00:02:20.311 --> 00:02:22.920
<v Speaker 1>person is nailing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The more we grow,</v>

45
00:02:22.921 --> 00:02:26.940
<v Speaker 1>the more this mastery of timing augments</v>
<v Speaker 1>our ability to get along in the world.</v>

46
00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.910
<v Speaker 1>It has its application in a perfectly </v>
<v Speaker 1>executed joke,</v>

47
00:02:29.911 --> 00:02:31.680
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but timing isn't everything.</v>

48
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.480
<v Speaker 1>It's in the way we treat our family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our friends,</v>

49
00:02:33.481 --> 00:02:34.650
<v Speaker 1>our teachers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our bosses,</v>

50
00:02:34.651 --> 00:02:35.484
<v Speaker 1>our employees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A good relationship depends on knowing </v>

51
00:02:37.861 --> 00:02:39.090
<v Speaker 1>when you should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

52
00:02:39.091 --> 00:02:39.924
<v Speaker 1>be deferential when you should stick up </v>
<v Speaker 1>for your opinion on understanding when </v>

53
00:02:42.961 --> 00:02:46.200
<v Speaker 1>it's okay to offer help to a friend and </v>
<v Speaker 1>when it's okay to ask for it.</v>

54
00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.510
<v Speaker 1>Timing plays a huge part in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>writing.</v>

55
00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.860
<v Speaker 1>A good story is not interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for the rhythm at which it's told,</v>

56
00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.220
<v Speaker 1>the same goes for a good speech or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good lecture or a good vlog.</v>

57
00:02:56.221 --> 00:02:58.170
<v Speaker 1>I do think that it's a natural part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>growing up,</v>

58
00:02:58.171 --> 00:02:59.004
<v Speaker 1>but it's one that becomes so obsessive </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the early years that the desire to </v>

59
00:03:02.291 --> 00:03:03.124
<v Speaker 1>learn for learning's sake gets pushed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fringe because it holds no value in </v>

60
00:03:05.891 --> 00:03:06.724
<v Speaker 1>social currency and it's an obsession </v>
<v Speaker 1>that lingers into the first years of </v>

61
00:03:09.611 --> 00:03:12.820
<v Speaker 1>college because we're also anxious to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fit in and that's natural too,</v>

62
00:03:12.821 --> 00:03:13.654
<v Speaker 1>but I think eventually it dawns on us </v>
<v Speaker 1>that what it meant to be cool in high </v>

63
00:03:16.721 --> 00:03:20.200
<v Speaker 1>school is not really going to be enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>to make a happy life.</v>

64
00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.063
<v Speaker 1>After graduating college,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I became so extremely frustrated with </v>

65
00:03:23.441 --> 00:03:24.274
<v Speaker 1>how little I really knew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seemed to me that all my knowledge </v>

66
00:03:26.741 --> 00:03:29.950
<v Speaker 1>was like so many free floating clouds </v>
<v Speaker 1>that had no connection.</v>

67
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.100
<v Speaker 1>What I learned was easily forgotten and </v>
<v Speaker 1>often contradictory.</v>

68
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.180
<v Speaker 1>I had the timing stuff down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now I wanted to know things.</v>

69
00:03:37.181 --> 00:03:38.014
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to know everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I resolved to start at the beginning </v>

70
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:42.663
<v Speaker 1>with the foundation of all knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy and I began to read like I </v>

71
00:03:46.631 --> 00:03:51.631
<v Speaker 1>sometimes eat potato chips ferociously </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the result of all that was this a 36</v>

72
00:03:52.991 --> 00:03:57.190
<v Speaker 1>page discourse on truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Summing up everything that I thought and</v>

73
00:03:57.191 --> 00:03:58.024
<v Speaker 1>believed I had it printed up at Kinko's </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I sent a copy out to all my family </v>

74
00:04:01.751 --> 00:04:03.430
<v Speaker 1>and friends as if to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

75
00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.280
<v Speaker 1>this is what I know and this is who I </v>
<v Speaker 1>am.</v>

76
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.700
<v Speaker 1>If you're interested to read it and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can find a link to an online copy in the</v>

77
00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:10.080
<v Speaker 1>dubliner.</v>

78
00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.913
<v Speaker 1>I just reread it two years later and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't agree with everything that's in </v>

79
00:04:13.781 --> 00:04:15.160
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's to be expected.</v>

80
00:04:15.161 --> 00:04:17.020
<v Speaker 1>There's still a lot of things in there </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I do agree with.</v>

81
00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:18.213
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it symbolizes more at the beginning of </v>

82
00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.273
<v Speaker 1>the period of my life when I became </v>
<v Speaker 1>obsessed with learning and it's an </v>

83
00:04:23.651 --> 00:04:26.290
<v Speaker 1>appetite that is perpetually </v>
<v Speaker 1>unquenchable.</v>

84
00:04:26.291 --> 00:04:28.930
<v Speaker 1>It never gets boring because there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>always something more to learn.</v>

85
00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.790
<v Speaker 1>The timing was ironically not so great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of this happened after I had already</v>

86
00:04:33.791 --> 00:04:36.280
<v Speaker 1>graduated college.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After the countless thousands of dollars</v>

87
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.233
<v Speaker 1>we're already spent on an education that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish I could go back and get more out </v>

88
00:04:40.181 --> 00:04:41.014
<v Speaker 1>of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have taken so many more liberal </v>

89
00:04:43.061 --> 00:04:43.894
<v Speaker 1>arts classes if I had to do it again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Aha to the point of this circuitous </v>

90
00:04:47.951 --> 00:04:51.940
<v Speaker 1>video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can do it again on this phone.</v>

91
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.133
<v Speaker 1>I have an APP called Itunes u on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are literally dozens of courses </v>

92
00:04:57.941 --> 00:04:59.920
<v Speaker 1>from schools like Stanford,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yale,</v>

93
00:04:59.921 --> 00:05:00.754
<v Speaker 1>and Harvard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know how much harvard costs and </v>

94
00:05:03.101 --> 00:05:03.934
<v Speaker 1>tuition per year?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know how much work you have to </v>

95
00:05:06.641 --> 00:05:11.641
<v Speaker 1>put into get into that school and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>put their courses on my phone for free.</v>

96
00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.983
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>am I the only one who thinks this is </v>

97
00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.480
<v Speaker 1>awesome right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am taking a course,</v>

98
00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.260
<v Speaker 1>a Stanford course called the </v>
<v Speaker 1>international system in the 20th century</v>

99
00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:24.723
<v Speaker 1>on my couch with a beer for no money at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all and I don't have to do any of the </v>

100
00:05:33.971 --> 00:05:34.804
<v Speaker 1>home.</v>
