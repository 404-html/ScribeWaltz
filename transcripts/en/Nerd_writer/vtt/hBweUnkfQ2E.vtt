1
00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:03.370
<v Speaker 1>I was totally against the war in Iraq </v>
<v Speaker 1>from a.</v>

2
00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:07.990
<v Speaker 1>You can look at esquire magazine from </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] you can look at before that,</v>

3
00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.153
<v Speaker 1>and I was against the war in Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're moderating a forum with a </v>

4
00:00:12.071 --> 00:00:12.904
<v Speaker 1>candidate for president of the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States and you get hit with a couple of </v>

5
00:00:15.251 --> 00:00:19.180
<v Speaker 1>statements that are presented as truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The crux of the answer is that he,</v>

6
00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.043
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never supported the invasion of Iraq in </v>

7
00:00:21.911 --> 00:00:25.090
<v Speaker 1>2003.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This part you can check pretty easily.</v>

8
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.313
<v Speaker 1>Trump's referring to this article in </v>
<v Speaker 1>which he doesn't so much explicitly </v>

9
00:00:28.931 --> 00:00:29.764
<v Speaker 1>state his opposition to the war as say </v>
<v Speaker 1>what a mess it is and that he would </v>

10
00:00:32.381 --> 00:00:34.330
<v Speaker 1>never have handled it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

11
00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.020
<v Speaker 1>trump's repeated claim is that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>opposed the war from the beginning,</v>

12
00:00:38.021 --> 00:00:38.854
<v Speaker 1>which was a year before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This article was published in August </v>

13
00:00:41.081 --> 00:00:43.030
<v Speaker 1>2004 right at the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

14
00:00:43.031 --> 00:00:46.510
<v Speaker 1>when public opinion was changing on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>war from positive to negative.</v>

15
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:47.673
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>esquire felt so strongly that trump had </v>

16
00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.460
<v Speaker 1>misrepresented his position in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>piece,</v>

17
00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.010
<v Speaker 1>particularly in this major foreign </v>
<v Speaker 1>policy speech.</v>

18
00:00:54.011 --> 00:00:54.844
<v Speaker 1>From August.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was an opponent of the Iraq war from </v>

19
00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.740
<v Speaker 1>the beginning that they added an </v>
<v Speaker 1>editor's no correcting him at the top of</v>

20
00:01:02.741 --> 00:01:03.574
<v Speaker 1>the article.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Being a well informed and prepared </v>

21
00:01:04.931 --> 00:01:05.764
<v Speaker 1>moderator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would of course know all these </v>

22
00:01:06.821 --> 00:01:08.620
<v Speaker 1>things that trump's opposition to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>war,</v>

23
00:01:08.621 --> 00:01:12.730
<v Speaker 1>a cornerstone of his foreign policy </v>
<v Speaker 1>credentials is questionable at best,</v>

24
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:13.793
<v Speaker 1>and you would also know this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was set on the same stage to you </v>

25
00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.990
<v Speaker 1>less than an hour before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now my opponent was for the war in Iraq.</v>

26
00:01:19.991 --> 00:01:21.550
<v Speaker 1>He says he wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>

27
00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.160
<v Speaker 1>you can go back and look at the record.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He supported.</v>

28
00:01:24.161 --> 00:01:27.310
<v Speaker 1>He told Howard stern he supported it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you for invading Iraq?</v>

29
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess so.</v>

30
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.850
<v Speaker 1>So now's your chance to push back on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>statement that you know is a lie,</v>

31
00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:34.773
<v Speaker 1>a lie about an issue that was decisive </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Hillary Clinton's defeat by Barack </v>

32
00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.080
<v Speaker 1>Obama in 2008 ally.</v>

33
00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.310
<v Speaker 1>This candidate used to separate himself </v>
<v Speaker 1>from his primary opponents.</v>

34
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.750
<v Speaker 1>Just a fucking why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Correcting that sort of deceit is what a</v>

35
00:01:46.751 --> 00:01:50.810
<v Speaker 1>journalist is trained to do for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could just move on.</v>

36
00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.590
<v Speaker 1>People talk about you and commander in </v>
<v Speaker 1>chief and not just secretary Clinton,</v>

37
00:01:54.591 --> 00:01:57.230
<v Speaker 1>but some of your Republican opponents in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the primary season.</v>

38
00:01:57.231 --> 00:01:58.064
<v Speaker 1>Then they wonder about your temp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We shouldn't be too harsh on Matt Lauer </v>

39
00:02:00.681 --> 00:02:01.514
<v Speaker 1>alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fact checking in the 2016 election has </v>

40
00:02:02.931 --> 00:02:03.764
<v Speaker 1>proven to be a Gargantuan and uniquely </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult task in the face of two </v>

41
00:02:07.071 --> 00:02:09.710
<v Speaker 1>candidates with shaky relationships to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the truth.</v>

42
00:02:09.711 --> 00:02:10.544
<v Speaker 1>I mean there are no shortage of clip </v>
<v Speaker 1>compilations on Youtube Showing Hillary </v>

43
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.860
<v Speaker 1>Clinton being less than honest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a few weeks ago,</v>

44
00:02:15.861 --> 00:02:17.030
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she said,</v>

45
00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm the only candidate who ran an either</v>
<v Speaker 2>the democratic or the Republican primary</v>

46
00:02:21.591 --> 00:02:22.424
<v Speaker 2>who said from the very beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will not raise taxes on the middle </v>

47
00:02:26.091 --> 00:02:26.810
<v Speaker 2>class,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which</v>

48
00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:27.643
<v Speaker 1>is kind of odd considering that 15 out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of 17 gop candidates for president </v>

49
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.000
<v Speaker 1>actually signed a written pledge </v>
<v Speaker 1>agreeing to no tax likes,</v>

50
00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.520
<v Speaker 1>not just on the middle class on </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone.</v>

51
00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.760
<v Speaker 1>I found that live pretty easily with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>help of politifact.com,</v>

52
00:02:40.761 --> 00:02:43.700
<v Speaker 1>one of the largest online fact checking </v>
<v Speaker 1>sites in the world,</v>

53
00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.863
<v Speaker 1>and the Internet has been at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>forefront of dedicated fact checking </v>

54
00:02:47.541 --> 00:02:48.374
<v Speaker 1>operation since the early 2000 in 2016.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Duke reporters' lab found 96 active </v>

55
00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:54.483
<v Speaker 1>checking projects in 37 different </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries and these organizations do </v>

56
00:02:58.071 --> 00:03:01.870
<v Speaker 1>great work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dubious political statements and judging</v>

57
00:03:01.871 --> 00:03:06.800
<v Speaker 1>their accuracy on nuanced rating scales,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was one problem,</v>

58
00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.370
<v Speaker 3>Mr Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's stay on this issue of immigration.</v>

59
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.050
<v Speaker 3>You have been very critical of Mark </v>
<v Speaker 3>Zuckerberg of facebook who is wanting to</v>

60
00:03:13.051 --> 00:03:16.500
<v Speaker 3>increase the number of these.</v>
<v Speaker 3>H One is not at all critical of him.</v>

61
00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.610
<v Speaker 3>Where did I read this and come up with </v>
<v Speaker 3>this that you were to league?</v>

62
00:03:19.611 --> 00:03:21.660
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your people write this stuff.</v>

63
00:03:21.661 --> 00:03:22.494
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

64
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.040
<v Speaker 1>The problem is that television is still </v>
<v Speaker 1>the number one source of information for</v>

65
00:03:28.041 --> 00:03:28.874
<v Speaker 1>American voters and on television.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Politicians who lie often get a free </v>

66
00:03:32.901 --> 00:03:33.860
<v Speaker 1>pass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the clip,</v>

67
00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.220
<v Speaker 1>we just saw that moderator went on to </v>
<v Speaker 1>apologize for her mistake.</v>

68
00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:38.293
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty unbelievable considering </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the article she mentioned with </v>

69
00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.940
<v Speaker 1>trump's criticism of mark Zuckerberg not</v>
<v Speaker 1>only existed,</v>

70
00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.560
<v Speaker 1>it existed on trump's home website,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's unpreparedness to the extreme,</v>

71
00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:49.483
<v Speaker 1>but it goes further than that because </v>
<v Speaker 1>even when you are aggressive and </v>

72
00:03:51.891 --> 00:03:52.724
<v Speaker 1>prepared,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump has a way of wriggling out of the </v>

73
00:03:54.951 --> 00:03:55.784
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when he lied and said that he saw </v>

74
00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.990
<v Speaker 1>Arabs cheering in Jersey City on nine </v>
<v Speaker 1>slash 11,</v>

75
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the police</v>

76
00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:01.553
<v Speaker 4>say that didn't happen at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those rumors have been on the Internet </v>

77
00:04:03.691 --> 00:04:06.110
<v Speaker 4>for some time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So did you meet Mr Yesterday?</v>

78
00:04:06.111 --> 00:04:08.610
<v Speaker 4>I saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was that with your own eyes,</v>

79
00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.953
<v Speaker 4>George,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we didn't have a people that were </v>

80
00:04:11.221 --> 00:04:12.054
<v Speaker 4>cheering and the other side of New </v>
<v Speaker 4>Jersey where you have large Arab </v>

81
00:04:14.941 --> 00:04:15.774
<v Speaker 4>populations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were cheering is the world trade </v>

82
00:04:17.671 --> 00:04:18.504
<v Speaker 4>center came down.</v>

83
00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:21.520
<v Speaker 1>We have three extremely important </v>
<v Speaker 1>presidential debates coming up.</v>

84
00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:22.413
<v Speaker 1>Those moderators have a huge task taking</v>
<v Speaker 1>on candidates as shameless as trump and </v>

85
00:04:26.591 --> 00:04:27.424
<v Speaker 1>as calculated as Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but their focus should be on the </v>

86
00:04:30.641 --> 00:04:35.200
<v Speaker 1>audience and on what works and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>works on TV is imagery,</v>

87
00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:36.400
<v Speaker 1>graphics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

88
00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:40.600
<v Speaker 1>one of the most effective fat checks </v>
<v Speaker 1>this election season was by Fox News,</v>

89
00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.940
<v Speaker 1>who not only called trump out on his </v>
<v Speaker 1>lies,</v>

90
00:04:42.941 --> 00:04:47.080
<v Speaker 1>but projected the actual facts onto the </v>
<v Speaker 1>screen for the audience to see</v>

91
00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.040
<v Speaker 3>your numbers don't add up.</v>

92
00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:53.240
<v Speaker 1>The second thing networks should do is </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact check in real time on Chiron's,</v>

93
00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.640
<v Speaker 1>as was pointed out to me by master fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>checkers,</v>

94
00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.100
<v Speaker 1>Alexios [inaudible] lease over at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>poynter institute,</v>

95
00:04:58.101 --> 00:05:02.210
<v Speaker 1>CNN experimented with fact checking </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chiron's earlier this election season.</v>

96
00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.460
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's unclear if it was a mistake,</v>

97
00:05:04.461 --> 00:05:06.950
<v Speaker 1>but for God's sake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was awesome.</v>

98
00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:08.143
<v Speaker 1>A huge problem with lies on TV news is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they tend to be repeated or shown </v>

99
00:05:11.151 --> 00:05:13.670
<v Speaker 1>without any clear indication that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're false.</v>

100
00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:14.773
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did that at the beginning of this </v>

101
00:05:16.101 --> 00:05:16.934
<v Speaker 1>video in 2012.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The new America Foundation found that </v>

102
00:05:19.011 --> 00:05:19.844
<v Speaker 1>the more familiar a claim becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more likely we are to think it's </v>

103
00:05:23.001 --> 00:05:25.790
<v Speaker 1>true even after we've heard a </v>
<v Speaker 1>correction.</v>

104
00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.360
<v Speaker 1>So instead of that completely stupid </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience reaction,</v>

105
00:05:29.361 --> 00:05:30.194
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meter networks carrying the debates </v>

106
00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.900
<v Speaker 1>could throw up a Kyron that refutes </v>
<v Speaker 1>patently false claims in real time.</v>

107
00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:37.700
<v Speaker 1>TV networks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by and large,</v>

108
00:05:37.701 --> 00:05:38.534
<v Speaker 1>have steered clear of these measures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps out of some vague notion of </v>

109
00:05:41.211 --> 00:05:42.044
<v Speaker 1>neutrality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One debate moderator has already said </v>

110
00:05:43.521 --> 00:05:46.790
<v Speaker 1>that he doesn't feel like it's his job </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be a truth squad.</v>

111
00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:51.320
<v Speaker 3>What do you do if the they make </v>
<v Speaker 3>assertions that you know to be untrue?</v>

112
00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:54.110
<v Speaker 3>That's not my job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how I do not believe that it's my</v>

113
00:05:54.111 --> 00:05:55.790
<v Speaker 3>job to be a truth squad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What</v>

114
00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:56.803
<v Speaker 1>are news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if not truth squads free people the </v>

115
00:06:00.771 --> 00:06:01.604
<v Speaker 1>world over still care about facts,</v>
