1
00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:06.620
<v Speaker 1>So the original star wars trilogy </v>
<v Speaker 1>episodes four,</v>

2
00:00:06.621 --> 00:00:07.454
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and six has a total run time of six </v>

3
00:00:09.951 --> 00:00:10.784
<v Speaker 1>hours and 20 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Each movie is pretty much the same </v>

4
00:00:13.551 --> 00:00:15.230
<v Speaker 1>length,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little over two hours,</v>

5
00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.420
<v Speaker 1>and they're also the same in another </v>
<v Speaker 1>respect.</v>

6
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.350
<v Speaker 1>The amount of time that they feature the</v>
<v Speaker 1>series main villain.</v>

7
00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.560
<v Speaker 1>Darth vader in terms of actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>screentime vader,</v>

8
00:00:24.561 --> 00:00:25.394
<v Speaker 1>gets astonishingly little in a new hope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's in the film for only eight minutes </v>

9
00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:30.493
<v Speaker 1>in empire strikes back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's in it for 12 minutes and in return </v>

10
00:00:33.231 --> 00:00:34.064
<v Speaker 1>of the Jedi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he tops out at about 14 minutes on </v>

11
00:00:36.561 --> 00:00:37.394
<v Speaker 1>screen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but these altogether and darth vader </v>

12
00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.520
<v Speaker 1>maybe cinemas most iconic villain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if not character in general,</v>

13
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.990
<v Speaker 1>flashed across movie screens for a total</v>
<v Speaker 1>of only 34 minutes.</v>

14
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:48.883
<v Speaker 1>In this video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to take a look at vader's visual </v>

15
00:00:50.781 --> 00:00:51.614
<v Speaker 1>footprint in the original trilogy to see</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we can't locate what gives him this </v>

16
00:00:55.341 --> 00:00:57.680
<v Speaker 1>iconic status in such a short time.</v>

17
00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:58.813
<v Speaker 1>In episode four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Darth Vader is only in six percent of </v>

18
00:01:00.651 --> 00:01:01.484
<v Speaker 1>the movie and his scenes are striking in</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the character fades into the </v>

19
00:01:05.241 --> 00:01:08.030
<v Speaker 1>background both narratively and </v>
<v Speaker 1>visually.</v>

20
00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:09.163
<v Speaker 1>For the bulk of episode four or Vader is</v>
<v Speaker 1>portrayed as the subordinate of grandma </v>

21
00:01:12.831 --> 00:01:15.770
<v Speaker 1>off Tarkin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so a good portion of his screen time has</v>

22
00:01:15.771 --> 00:01:18.260
<v Speaker 1>him in the background or off to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>side,</v>

23
00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:19.243
<v Speaker 1>cut off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes out of focus even when he's </v>

24
00:01:21.741 --> 00:01:22.574
<v Speaker 1>being filmed directly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vader's black uniform feeds into the </v>

25
00:01:25.191 --> 00:01:26.024
<v Speaker 1>shadows of the set and there is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>noticeable lack of separation between </v>

26
00:01:29.001 --> 00:01:32.150
<v Speaker 1>foreground and background.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's hard to say how much of this is</v>

27
00:01:32.151 --> 00:01:32.984
<v Speaker 1>a narrative or thematic choice and how </v>
<v Speaker 1>much is down to the constraints of </v>

28
00:01:35.931 --> 00:01:36.764
<v Speaker 1>filming all of Darth vader scenes in </v>
<v Speaker 1>episode four with the exception of the </v>

29
00:01:39.741 --> 00:01:44.540
<v Speaker 1>first take place in or around the </v>
<v Speaker 1>deathstar Gilbert Taylor,</v>

30
00:01:44.541 --> 00:01:45.374
<v Speaker 1>the cinematographer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was famously annoyed with filming these </v>

31
00:01:47.871 --> 00:01:52.640
<v Speaker 1>scenes because he didn't like the black </v>
<v Speaker 1>and gray sets made by John Barry,</v>

32
00:01:52.641 --> 00:01:55.820
<v Speaker 1>which provided little opportunity for </v>
<v Speaker 1>targeted lighting.</v>

33
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.833
<v Speaker 1>Taylor was actually forced to cut holes </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the sets and outfit them with courts </v>

34
00:02:00.201 --> 00:02:01.034
<v Speaker 1>lamps that lit the environment evenly </v>
<v Speaker 1>for flexibility in shooting flexibility </v>

35
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.133
<v Speaker 1>but not specificity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not to say that darth vader </v>

36
00:02:08.691 --> 00:02:11.140
<v Speaker 1>doesn't make an impact in episode four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

37
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.580
<v Speaker 1>this is the film that launched the whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

38
00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.440
<v Speaker 1>and visually the movie does make a bold </v>
<v Speaker 1>statement out of the gate by introducing</v>

39
00:02:18.441 --> 00:02:19.274
<v Speaker 1>vader right away as a menacing jet black</v>
<v Speaker 1>presidents against the white interior </v>

40
00:02:24.051 --> 00:02:24.884
<v Speaker 1>walls of a rebel spaceship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do think that there's more iconic </v>

41
00:02:28.551 --> 00:02:31.550
<v Speaker 1>vader imagery to come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see that right away.</v>

42
00:02:31.551 --> 00:02:32.384
<v Speaker 1>In episode five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Empire strikes back the first time </v>

43
00:02:34.551 --> 00:02:35.384
<v Speaker 1>vader appears on screen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get this iconic helmet shot from </v>

44
00:02:38.331 --> 00:02:39.164
<v Speaker 1>behind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's so cool about this shot is that </v>

45
00:02:40.821 --> 00:02:41.654
<v Speaker 1>it's essentially black on black and yet </v>
<v Speaker 1>director Irvin Kershner and </v>

46
00:02:44.781 --> 00:02:45.614
<v Speaker 1>cinematographer Peter [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>find a way to make vader stand out with </v>

47
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.180
<v Speaker 1>reflections and texture and shape all </v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout the film.</v>

48
00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:54.043
<v Speaker 1>They find ways to key into the elemental</v>
<v Speaker 1>quality of Vader as an archetype or </v>

49
00:02:58.341 --> 00:02:59.174
<v Speaker 1>representation of evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they upped the ante on the work </v>

50
00:03:01.631 --> 00:03:03.730
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And episode four in that movie,</v>

51
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.350
<v Speaker 1>vader's helmet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

52
00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:06.184
<v Speaker 1>is dirty smudged used.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This might have something to do with </v>

53
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.090
<v Speaker 1>Lucas's desire to have a naturalistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>documentary feel to the movie.</v>

54
00:03:13.091 --> 00:03:15.550
<v Speaker 1>Something he often argued about with Gil</v>
<v Speaker 1>Taylor,</v>

55
00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:16.743
<v Speaker 1>but an empire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The helmet is as smooth as volcanic </v>

56
00:03:19.481 --> 00:03:20.314
<v Speaker 1>glass and always spotlessly clean so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it features these fat white </v>

57
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.890
<v Speaker 1>reflections which highlighted shape </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kirschner,</v>

58
00:03:26.891 --> 00:03:27.724
<v Speaker 1>and so she seemed to understand that </v>
<v Speaker 1>visually vader increased in dramatic </v>

59
00:03:31.601 --> 00:03:34.810
<v Speaker 1>weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The less naturalistic and more pure that</v>

60
00:03:34.811 --> 00:03:35.644
<v Speaker 1>he seemed after all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most iconic symbols in our culture </v>

61
00:03:37.711 --> 00:03:38.544
<v Speaker 1>are the ones that can be boiled down to </v>
<v Speaker 1>their basic shape and still be </v>

62
00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:42.363
<v Speaker 1>instantaneously recognizable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Episode five takes advantage of this </v>

63
00:03:45.401 --> 00:03:46.234
<v Speaker 1>with the masterful use of silhouette.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in these moments that vader </v>

64
00:03:49.421 --> 00:03:54.421
<v Speaker 1>transcends his role as a character in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie and becomes a symbol for something</v>

65
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.400
<v Speaker 1>much deeper and much more universal.</v>

66
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:00.333
<v Speaker 1>The empire strikes back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think is inventive with it's darth </v>

67
00:04:02.111 --> 00:04:02.944
<v Speaker 1>vader imagery in a way that both of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other films aren't as much with only 12 </v>

68
00:04:06.941 --> 00:04:07.774
<v Speaker 1>minutes of screen time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The filmmakers do a lot to add to the </v>

69
00:04:09.911 --> 00:04:14.110
<v Speaker 1>mystique of the character and the film </v>
<v Speaker 1>features those images of vader that have</v>

70
00:04:14.111 --> 00:04:14.944
<v Speaker 1>seared themselves onto my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From the very first time I watched </v>

71
00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:19.043
<v Speaker 1>episode six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>return of the Jedi largely holds onto </v>

72
00:04:21.401 --> 00:04:22.234
<v Speaker 1>that pristine look from empire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It even copy some of the empire shots </v>

73
00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.020
<v Speaker 1>exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but overall Jeddah is less inspired when</v>

74
00:04:29.021 --> 00:04:29.854
<v Speaker 1>it comes to Darth vader cinematography.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He often looks flat against backgrounds </v>

75
00:04:33.071 --> 00:04:33.904
<v Speaker 1>and the framing and lighting isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>nearly as compelling as Kirsch nurse </v>

76
00:04:36.791 --> 00:04:37.624
<v Speaker 1>work on episode five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kershner was so devoted to his own </v>

77
00:04:40.451 --> 00:04:43.060
<v Speaker 1>vision that he didn't shoot master </v>
<v Speaker 1>shots,</v>

78
00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:44.103
<v Speaker 1>which meant that Lucas would have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>edit the scenes roughly how Kirschner </v>

79
00:04:47.351 --> 00:04:48.184
<v Speaker 1>intended them.</v>

80
00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:49.323
<v Speaker 1>By most accounts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lucas' hired Richard Markwan as a sort </v>

81
00:04:51.461 --> 00:04:53.710
<v Speaker 1>of working man's director for episode </v>
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>

82
00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:54.723
<v Speaker 1>somebody who could bring the film in on </v>
<v Speaker 1>time and within budget and give Lucas </v>

83
00:04:58.421 --> 00:05:01.510
<v Speaker 1>enough options to construct the film in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the edit.</v>

84
00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:02.403
<v Speaker 1>As a result,</v>
<v Speaker 1>episode six lacks the character work </v>

85
00:05:04.151 --> 00:05:06.130
<v Speaker 1>that was a signature of [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 1>style,</v>

86
00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:07.063
<v Speaker 1>or what jetblue does give us is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>famous final scene where Darth vader is </v>

87
00:05:10.211 --> 00:05:11.044
<v Speaker 1>finally unmasked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a moment that brings the archetype </v>

88
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.230
<v Speaker 1>down to earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The actual face of evil is just the face</v>

89
00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.200
<v Speaker 1>of a broken man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more pathetic than anything,</v>

90
00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.470
<v Speaker 1>and then that way deeply human.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

91
00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.350
<v Speaker 1>the legacy of Darth vader is an all in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the visuals,</v>

92
00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:27.970
<v Speaker 1>the writing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the costume,</v>

93
00:05:27.971 --> 00:05:31.570
<v Speaker 1>and James Earl Jones vocal performance </v>
<v Speaker 1>contribute hugely to the characters,</v>

94
00:05:31.571 --> 00:05:34.690
<v Speaker 1>continued faint,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even his breathing is iconic,</v>

95
00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:36.063
<v Speaker 1>but film is a visual medium and when all</v>
<v Speaker 1>these things are wrapped in the right </v>

96
00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.880
<v Speaker 1>image,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the effects can be mythic.</v>

97
00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:44.313
<v Speaker 1>What's amazing is that Lucas Kirschner </v>
<v Speaker 1>achieved this in just a handful of </v>

98
00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:51.690
<v Speaker 1>minutes and the impact for itself.</v>
