1
00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.370
<v Speaker 1>I had just turned 13 when the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>Harry Potter movie came out.</v>

2
00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:23.803
<v Speaker 1>According to Warner brothers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nearly 60 percent of the people who saw </v>

3
00:00:26.451 --> 00:00:30.870
<v Speaker 1>that movie were 17 or younger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For a whole general,</v>

4
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:32.423
<v Speaker 1>the Harry Potter series spanned are </v>
<v Speaker 1>adolescents and imprinted onto our </v>

5
00:00:35.491 --> 00:00:37.170
<v Speaker 1>lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A love of reading,</v>

6
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:38.813
<v Speaker 1>but less has been said about the films.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think their commitment to good </v>

7
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:43.703
<v Speaker 1>cinematic work was potentially just as </v>
<v Speaker 1>important for young people's filmic </v>

8
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.863
<v Speaker 1>education as j Dot k dot rowling's </v>
<v Speaker 1>accomplishments were for our literary </v>

9
00:00:52.321 --> 00:00:53.580
<v Speaker 1>upwork.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>

10
00:00:53.581 --> 00:00:56.040
<v Speaker 1>that all starts with Alfonzo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Koran,</v>

11
00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.963
<v Speaker 1>and the third film in the series,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the prisoner of Azkaban coming at a </v>

12
00:01:00.361 --> 00:01:03.000
<v Speaker 1>crucial time in both the books and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>films.</v>

13
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:04.163
<v Speaker 1>Azkaban marks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Potters transitioned from perilous </v>

14
00:01:06.031 --> 00:01:06.864
<v Speaker 1>adventure stories for children to </v>
<v Speaker 1>increasingly dark increasingly nuanced </v>

15
00:01:12.451 --> 00:01:15.720
<v Speaker 1>treatments of character and plot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pick,</v>

16
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:16.291
<v Speaker 1>inquire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ron,</v>

17
00:01:16.291 --> 00:01:17.124
<v Speaker 1>to handle this passage seems perfect in </v>
<v Speaker 1>retrospect as it set the tone for the </v>

18
00:01:21.031 --> 00:01:24.390
<v Speaker 1>grimmer and grimy or final installment </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the series,</v>

19
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:25.763
<v Speaker 1>but warner brothers has to be credited </v>
<v Speaker 1>for taking a chance on a director whose </v>

20
00:01:28.501 --> 00:01:32.190
<v Speaker 1>previous film was an explicit Mexican </v>
<v Speaker 1>road trip,</v>

21
00:01:32.191 --> 00:01:34.660
<v Speaker 1>drove about sexual discovery.</v>

22
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.010
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the style of that film and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Korans previous work is readily apparent</v>

23
00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.863
<v Speaker 1>in Azkaban,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most notably his fondness for a moving </v>

24
00:01:42.701 --> 00:01:46.390
<v Speaker 1>often handheld camera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just take a quick sped up.</v>

25
00:01:46.391 --> 00:01:49.060
<v Speaker 1>Look at this early scene from the Great </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hall,</v>

26
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.433
<v Speaker 1>not a single shot is stationary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This gives the scene and the film a </v>

27
00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.230
<v Speaker 1>feeling of forward momentum and </v>
<v Speaker 1>establishes a curious camera,</v>

28
00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.333
<v Speaker 1>but it also lends to the film a sense of</v>
<v Speaker 1>unease and inability to find stable </v>

29
00:02:04.221 --> 00:02:05.054
<v Speaker 1>footing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now for a film that is to be haunted by </v>

30
00:02:06.861 --> 00:02:07.694
<v Speaker 1>a feared killer throughout such a style </v>
<v Speaker 1>is fitting and this isn't the only </v>

31
00:02:12.271 --> 00:02:17.271
<v Speaker 1>signature technique Koran brings to </v>
<v Speaker 1>potter is famous use of the long tail is</v>

32
00:02:17.491 --> 00:02:18.324
<v Speaker 1>here as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The shot right here is a minute and 49 </v>

33
00:02:20.881 --> 00:02:21.714
<v Speaker 1>seconds long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as the critic Kristen Thompson has </v>

34
00:02:23.191 --> 00:02:24.024
<v Speaker 1>noted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it marks a crucial tonal shift in the </v>

35
00:02:26.311 --> 00:02:28.140
<v Speaker 1>film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first two scenes,</v>

36
00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.970
<v Speaker 1>one in which Harry blows up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his horrible aunt and one which he takes</v>

37
00:02:32.971 --> 00:02:33.480
<v Speaker 1>a ride on.</v>

38
00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.900
<v Speaker 1>The ridiculous night busts are both </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty lighthearted.</v>

39
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.973
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost say that these two scenes are a </v>

40
00:02:38.911 --> 00:02:39.744
<v Speaker 1>nod to the two comparatively lighter </v>
<v Speaker 1>films that came before this in this </v>

41
00:02:44.641 --> 00:02:45.474
<v Speaker 1>scene and this shot Harry learns of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>true danger he faces than what's </v>

42
00:02:50.191 --> 00:02:52.080
<v Speaker 1>important to notice here is that with </v>
<v Speaker 1>deeper,</v>

43
00:02:52.081 --> 00:02:52.914
<v Speaker 1>more significant peril comes deeper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more significant isolation Mr Weasley </v>

44
00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.940
<v Speaker 1>pulls Harry into another part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>leaky cauldron,</v>

45
00:03:00.941 --> 00:03:01.774
<v Speaker 1>separating him from his friends while </v>
<v Speaker 1>keeping the specter of Sirius black in </v>

46
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:06.753
<v Speaker 1>the foreground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the conversation turns explicitly </v>

47
00:03:08.681 --> 00:03:09.514
<v Speaker 1>to black,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is images placed between them with </v>

48
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.750
<v Speaker 1>family and friends framed in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>background.</v>

49
00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.800
<v Speaker 1>Then Mr Risley pulls Harry into an </v>
<v Speaker 1>alcove so that they are alone,</v>

50
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.930
<v Speaker 1>asking Harry not to go looking for </v>
<v Speaker 1>black.</v>

51
00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.640
<v Speaker 1>And finally for the key dramatic </v>
<v Speaker 1>question and period on the scene.</v>

52
00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:28.610
<v Speaker 1>Well Ron Frames Harry completely by </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself.</v>

53
00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:30.900
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is great film.</v>

54
00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.230
<v Speaker 1>Isolation will go on to be a key theme </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Asca Pan and the rest of the series,</v>

55
00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:37.333
<v Speaker 1>despite its constant message of </v>
<v Speaker 1>friendship and it's focus on the bond </v>

56
00:03:40.671 --> 00:03:42.620
<v Speaker 1>between Harry Ron and her mining.</v>

57
00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.980
<v Speaker 1>The series returns with Ridley to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Harry's,</v>

58
00:03:45.981 --> 00:03:50.981
<v Speaker 1>feelings of being alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The chosen one is gradual realization of</v>

59
00:03:50.991 --> 00:03:53.780
<v Speaker 1>a burden that he must carry without </v>
<v Speaker 1>help.</v>

60
00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:55.413
<v Speaker 1>Prisoner of Azkaban reflects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deepens and foreshadows these feelings </v>

61
00:03:58.661 --> 00:03:59.494
<v Speaker 1>by separating Harry out from his </v>
<v Speaker 1>surroundings or else placing him apart </v>

62
00:04:03.041 --> 00:04:07.750
<v Speaker 1>from those around him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Koran never misses a chance to return to</v>

63
00:04:07.751 --> 00:04:08.584
<v Speaker 1>this theme,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it means separating Harry from </v>

64
00:04:10.601 --> 00:04:13.150
<v Speaker 1>his friends in a shot about something </v>
<v Speaker 1>else,</v>

65
00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.510
<v Speaker 1>telling Emma Watson to neal out of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>shot or ending the movie by having Harry</v>

66
00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:24.210
<v Speaker 1>literally fly away from a crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Internal consistency.</v>

67
00:04:24.251 --> 00:04:25.084
<v Speaker 1>This is one of Koran's major strengths.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what makes the prisoner of </v>

68
00:04:27.911 --> 00:04:30.910
<v Speaker 1>Azkaban a cut above the rest of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>films in the series,</v>

69
00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.893
<v Speaker 1>some of which are quite good motifs </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoot back and forth across the runtime </v>

70
00:04:37.171 --> 00:04:40.060
<v Speaker 1>like magic spells and comment on each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>

71
00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.923
<v Speaker 1>tightening a web that leases meaning </v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout little things like following </v>

72
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.890
<v Speaker 1>empty footsteps in the snow before </v>
<v Speaker 1>introducing a key object that visualizes</v>

73
00:04:50.891 --> 00:04:54.520
<v Speaker 1>people moving through hogwarts castle </v>
<v Speaker 1>with footsteps.</v>

74
00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.923
<v Speaker 1>Some immediate foreshadowing there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what about some longer </v>

75
00:04:58.211 --> 00:04:59.044
<v Speaker 1>foreshadowing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe a little bird that flies around </v>

76
00:05:01.511 --> 00:05:02.344
<v Speaker 1>the grounds in the beginning of the film</v>
<v Speaker 1>to places will only later occur to us </v>

77
00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.640
<v Speaker 1>that map the sites of significant scenes</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the movie,</v>

78
00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:10.803
<v Speaker 1>or what about something more meaningful </v>
<v Speaker 1>like Korans recurring motif of moving </v>

79
00:05:14.381 --> 00:05:15.214
<v Speaker 1>the camera through glass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Motif that pays off twice in this </v>

80
00:05:19.121 --> 00:05:21.550
<v Speaker 1>scene where the students fight off of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bulger,</v>

81
00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:22.413
<v Speaker 1>a creature that visualizes your worst </v>
<v Speaker 1>fear twice in this seat into beautiful </v>

82
00:05:27.161 --> 00:05:30.400
<v Speaker 1>shots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The camera moves through the mirrors.</v>

83
00:05:30.401 --> 00:05:31.234
<v Speaker 1>Have this wardrobe suggesting that while</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's important to look through windows </v>

84
00:05:34.871 --> 00:05:38.590
<v Speaker 1>and see the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can also look through mirrors,</v>

85
00:05:38.591 --> 00:05:39.424
<v Speaker 1>which is to say into yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not to mention that these shots just </v>

86
00:05:43.391 --> 00:05:44.860
<v Speaker 1>make you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

87
00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.630
<v Speaker 1>how did he do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A great question for any young film goer</v>

88
00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.940
<v Speaker 1>to ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the point here,</v>

89
00:05:51.941 --> 00:05:52.360
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

90
00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.193
<v Speaker 1>We hear so much about a film industry </v>
<v Speaker 1>that continues to pump out crap films </v>

91
00:05:57.621 --> 00:06:00.740
<v Speaker 1>that's ruled by lowest common </v>
<v Speaker 1>denominator fair.</v>

92
00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:02.870
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are a number of reasons for that,</v>

93
00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:03.963
<v Speaker 1>but one of them is that a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie going public suffers from </v>

94
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:10.850
<v Speaker 1>cinematic illiteracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what makes a good film,</v>

95
00:06:10.851 --> 00:06:15.170
<v Speaker 1>so the industry serves up superficial </v>
<v Speaker 1>projects that play on cheap emotions and</v>

96
00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.273
<v Speaker 1>make us into passive viewers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but learning film is always an active </v>

97
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:22.213
<v Speaker 1>enterprise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All great movies are teaching movies </v>

98
00:06:24.831 --> 00:06:29.630
<v Speaker 1>because they encourage us to participate</v>
<v Speaker 1>with them and with the whole of cinema.</v>

99
00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.660
<v Speaker 1>This is why the prisoner of Azkaban is </v>
<v Speaker 1>so important,</v>

100
00:06:32.661 --> 00:06:33.494
<v Speaker 1>like anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's easy to develop a taste for </v>

101
00:06:34.731 --> 00:06:36.860
<v Speaker 1>something when we learn it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Young.</v>

102
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.220
<v Speaker 1>Harry Potter is a mega franchise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

103
00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:41.113
<v Speaker 1>millions of kids bought tickets for and </v>
<v Speaker 1>millions more will watch and rewatch at </v>

104
00:06:46.521 --> 00:06:47.354
<v Speaker 1>home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Having a great film like this in that </v>

105
00:06:50.211 --> 00:06:51.440
<v Speaker 1>roster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

106
00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:52.303
<v Speaker 1>the results could be exponential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Small light that in the end shines much </v>

107
00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:02.060
<v Speaker 1>brighter than anyone would expect.</v>

108
00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:08.860
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

109
00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:11.950
<v Speaker 1>thanks for watching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously I'm a huge Harry Potter Fan.</v>

110
00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:14.470
<v Speaker 1>I grew up with those books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those ages at the beginning.</v>

111
00:07:14.471 --> 00:07:18.010
<v Speaker 1>We're actually my ages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this was a blast to make.</v>

112
00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:21.240
<v Speaker 1>I want to thank you guys actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>because a lot of people actually pledged</v>

113
00:07:21.241 --> 00:07:22.074
<v Speaker 1>a dollar or $3 after last week's video </v>
<v Speaker 1>and those small pledges really mean so </v>

114
00:07:26.651 --> 00:07:30.880
<v Speaker 1>much because what matters to me is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have the ability to pledge,</v>

115
00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:31.773
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to do so over a longterm </v>
<v Speaker 1>period because the patrion is really my </v>

116
00:07:36.191 --> 00:07:37.024
