00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:03.450
<v Speaker 1>Coffee on Tuesday and blog for,</v>

2
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:15.263
<v Speaker 1>do they want to talk about the peaceful </v>
<v Speaker 1>protests currently happening in Lower </v>

3
00:00:17.071 --> 00:00:17.904
<v Speaker 1>Manhattan called Occupy Wall Street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's starting to get some buzz in the </v>

4
00:00:20.791 --> 00:00:24.600
<v Speaker 1>mainstream media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I watched obsessively and also the</v>

5
00:00:24.601 --> 00:00:27.960
<v Speaker 1>rosy eyes of Michael Moore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you know it's legitimate.</v>

6
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.610
<v Speaker 1>So occupy Wall Street is a leaderless </v>
<v Speaker 1>protests with a vague set of demands.</v>

7
00:00:31.611 --> 00:00:34.440
<v Speaker 1>It started by Canadian activist group </v>
<v Speaker 1>called ad busters and the names,</v>

8
00:00:34.441 --> 00:00:37.320
<v Speaker 1>the model of the protest from Tahrir </v>
<v Speaker 1>Square in Egypt last March,</v>

9
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.363
<v Speaker 1>which unseated their President Mubarak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Tahrir Square protest had a simple </v>

10
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.200
<v Speaker 1>but intense demand move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bark must resign.</v>

11
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.200
<v Speaker 1>The protest in Liberty Park is crowded </v>
<v Speaker 1>with lots of littler,</v>

12
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.093
<v Speaker 1>less forceful demand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of the come to protest </v>

13
00:00:51.361 --> 00:00:52.560
<v Speaker 1>unemployment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some protests,</v>

14
00:00:52.561 --> 00:00:54.750
<v Speaker 1>the wealth inequality in this country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the wars,</v>

15
00:00:54.751 --> 00:00:56.970
<v Speaker 1>some of the corruption of campaign </v>
<v Speaker 1>finance laws,</v>

16
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.833
<v Speaker 1>some environmental issues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and some of them just to create a </v>

17
00:00:59.761 --> 00:01:00.594
<v Speaker 1>spectacle despite their demands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Presumably everybody is angry at the </v>

18
00:01:03.331 --> 00:01:04.020
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>

19
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.853
<v Speaker 1>The reckless abandoned perpetrated on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Wall Street which caused the subprime </v>

20
00:01:07.471 --> 00:01:08.304
<v Speaker 1>mortgage crisis in 2008.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we should take a minute to </v>

21
00:01:10.321 --> 00:01:12.990
<v Speaker 1>understand the financial crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One Minute,</v>

22
00:01:12.991 --> 00:01:13.824
<v Speaker 1>so Wall Street started bundling home </v>
<v Speaker 1>loans together and selling slices of </v>

23
00:01:15.661 --> 00:01:18.000
<v Speaker 1>those loans to investors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Investors were making big money,</v>

24
00:01:18.001 --> 00:01:19.290
<v Speaker 1>so they started pushing the lender </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

25
00:01:19.291 --> 00:01:20.700
<v Speaker 1>we need more loans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lenders,</v>

26
00:01:20.701 --> 00:01:22.200
<v Speaker 1>we're already giving people loans with </v>
<v Speaker 1>good credit,</v>

27
00:01:22.201 --> 00:01:23.034
<v Speaker 1>so they started lowering their criteria </v>
<v Speaker 1>used to be you needed a credit score of </v>

28
00:01:25.261 --> 00:01:26.094
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 and a down payment of 20 percent and </v>

29
00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.030
<v Speaker 1>they'll settle for a 500 credit score </v>
<v Speaker 1>and no money down.</v>

30
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.690
<v Speaker 1>Joe Schmo buyer assumes that at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bank's willing to lend him money that he</v>

31
00:01:33.691 --> 00:01:36.270
<v Speaker 1>must be able to afford it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He buys his dream house banks.</v>

32
00:01:36.271 --> 00:01:38.370
<v Speaker 1>New Securities based on bad mortgages </v>
<v Speaker 1>were risky.</v>

33
00:01:38.371 --> 00:01:41.790
<v Speaker 1>So to control potential fallout,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they started buying insurance mortgages.</v>

34
00:01:41.791 --> 00:01:44.220
<v Speaker 1>Default,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the insurance company pays default swap,</v>

35
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.410
<v Speaker 1>so the banks have potential losses.</v>

36
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.550
<v Speaker 1>In short,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the risk moves off their books.</v>

37
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.300
<v Speaker 1>They invest more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One insurance company took on more swaps</v>

38
00:01:51.301 --> 00:01:53.580
<v Speaker 1>than any other American international </v>
<v Speaker 1>group.</v>

39
00:01:53.581 --> 00:01:56.090
<v Speaker 1>Why did they do this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Feeds premiums millions.</v>

40
00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.890
<v Speaker 1>How'd you think of the housing market?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We keep going up,</v>

41
00:01:58.891 --> 00:02:01.530
<v Speaker 1>but then all of a sudden the housing </v>
<v Speaker 1>prices go down.</v>

42
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.200
<v Speaker 1>Joe Schmo buyer bought his dream house </v>
<v Speaker 1>at a teaser rate mortgage.</v>

43
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.150
<v Speaker 1>Now that rate goes away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>payments go up.</v>

44
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.040
<v Speaker 1>He defaults mortgage back securities </v>
<v Speaker 1>tank.</v>

45
00:02:08.041 --> 00:02:10.500
<v Speaker 1>Aig has to pay off the swaps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of them at the same time,</v>

46
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.090
<v Speaker 1>all over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't afford it,</v>

47
00:02:12.091 --> 00:02:13.650
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the government does this.</v>

48
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.420
<v Speaker 1>The government under treasury secretary </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hank Paulson,</v>

49
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.110
<v Speaker 1>passes the emergency economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>stabilization act through which they can</v>

50
00:02:25.111 --> 00:02:25.944
<v Speaker 1>purchase troubled assets and inject </v>
<v Speaker 1>capital into the banks from a fund </v>

51
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.570
<v Speaker 1>called the troubled asset relief </v>
<v Speaker 1>program,</v>

52
00:02:30.571 --> 00:02:32.790
<v Speaker 1>which holds a cool $700,</v>
<v Speaker 1>billion.</v>

53
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.893
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the quick legislation did prevent a </v>

54
00:02:35.371 --> 00:02:36.204
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it didn't stop people from losing </v>

55
00:02:37.231 --> 00:02:38.064
<v Speaker 1>confidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't stop people from holding onto </v>

56
00:02:39.211 --> 00:02:40.044
<v Speaker 1>their money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't stop them from not consuming </v>

57
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.960
<v Speaker 1>the goods and services of this economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So demand goes down.</v>

58
00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.823
<v Speaker 1>The economy contracts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>businesses stop hiring and three years </v>

59
00:02:49.981 --> 00:02:50.814
<v Speaker 1>later,</v>

60
00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.333
<v Speaker 2>not enough,</v>

61
00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.570
<v Speaker 1>I think Wilson said this on Charlie rose</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 2008 constituents were angry and they</v>

62
00:03:14.761 --> 00:03:15.594
<v Speaker 1>had a right to be angry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had no part in making this the </v>

63
00:03:18.571 --> 00:03:20.490
<v Speaker 1>constituents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's us.</v>

64
00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.010
<v Speaker 1>He had no part in making this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but did we?</v>

65
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.903
<v Speaker 1>Are we guiltless?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had no part in making this or have </v>

66
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.930
<v Speaker 1>we as consumers pushed and pushed for </v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

67
00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.973
<v Speaker 1>every corporation to get us the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>deals on our goods and the best returns </v>

68
00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.923
<v Speaker 1>on our investments are we complicit in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>system which was driven to do anything </v>

69
00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.430
<v Speaker 1>to be Buffett stock value and lower its </v>
<v Speaker 1>prices on goods,</v>

70
00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.820
<v Speaker 1>even to the point of selling bundling </v>
<v Speaker 1>and gambling on bad mortgages so that we</v>

71
00:03:50.311 --> 00:03:52.090
<v Speaker 1>could get tee shirts at 20th.</v>

72
00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:53.143
<v Speaker 3>Capitalism has strengthened the part of </v>
<v Speaker 3>our brain that our consumers and </v>

73
00:04:01.341 --> 00:04:02.174
<v Speaker 3>investors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>super capitalism has made us </v>

74
00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.310
<v Speaker 3>terrifically adept at thinking of </v>
<v Speaker 3>ourselves and practicing being very,</v>

75
00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:19.090
<v Speaker 3>very efficient and adept.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Consumers and investors,</v>

76
00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:20.023
<v Speaker 1>don't get me wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not to say that the Wall Street </v>

77
00:04:21.321 --> 00:04:24.470
<v Speaker 1>titans are blameless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but each of us are made up of two parts.</v>

78
00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.640
<v Speaker 1>The part that is a consumer and the part</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is a citizen.</v>

79
00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:28.513
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Washington is awash with corporate </v>

80
00:04:30.201 --> 00:04:31.034
<v Speaker 3>lobbyists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what are those lobbyists actually </v>

81
00:04:32.091 --> 00:04:32.924
<v Speaker 3>doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most of those lobbyists are there in </v>

82
00:04:35.121 --> 00:04:40.121
<v Speaker 3>Washington to get a competitive </v>
<v Speaker 3>advantage over their competitors who are</v>

83
00:04:42.411 --> 00:04:43.244
<v Speaker 3>also in Washington trying to use public </v>
<v Speaker 3>policies to get a competitive advantage </v>

84
00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:48.463
<v Speaker 3>over their competitors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The noise level is so high that the </v>

85
00:04:53.251 --> 00:04:55.650
<v Speaker 3>public,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you and I cannot be heard,</v>

86
00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.870
<v Speaker 3>at least the citizen cannot be here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the consumer and investor in us.</v>

87
00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.720
<v Speaker 3>Here's the only voice that is being </v>
<v Speaker 3>heard.</v>

88
00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:08.683
<v Speaker 1>We're going to have to be willing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>give up some of the benefits that the </v>

89
00:05:10.911 --> 00:05:11.744
<v Speaker 1>consumer side of ourselves has gotten in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last few decades and certainly it's </v>

90
00:05:14.541 --> 00:05:15.374
<v Speaker 1>important as citizens that we exercise </v>
<v Speaker 1>our rights like the people in Liberty </v>

91
00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:19.723
<v Speaker 1>Park are doing right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but perhaps it's more important that as </v>

92
00:05:23.061 --> 00:05:26.510
<v Speaker 1>Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we exercise our privileges.</v>

93
00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:27.373
<v Speaker 1>One of our privileges is to learn and </v>
<v Speaker 1>study anything we want and do it </v>

94
00:05:30.261 --> 00:05:31.094
<v Speaker 1>systematically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's important that we lead with reason </v>

95
00:05:32.811 --> 00:05:34.130
<v Speaker 1>and not emotion.</v>

96
00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.470
<v Speaker 3>People are angry and frustrated and </v>
<v Speaker 3>worried about their jobs.</v>

97
00:05:37.471 --> 00:05:41.430
<v Speaker 3>If they feel that they are not getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>ahead and if they feel that the dice are</v>

98
00:05:41.431 --> 00:05:45.960
<v Speaker 3>loaded against them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that somehow the economy is is fixed.</v>

99
00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.810
<v Speaker 3>That government and business are in </v>
<v Speaker 3>cahoots.</v>

100
00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.973
<v Speaker 3>That's when you ignite the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>social change that could be very </v>

101
00:05:53.881 --> 00:05:58.140
<v Speaker 3>progressive and very reform minded,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also could be very reactionary,</v>

102
00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:00.510
<v Speaker 1>separate some cool articles in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>jubilee to about this.</v>

103
00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:01.530
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for listening and.</v>
