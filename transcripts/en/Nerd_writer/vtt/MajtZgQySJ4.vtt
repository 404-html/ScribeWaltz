1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.000
<v Speaker 1>Coffee on a Tuesday and blog 23 in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>art studio.</v>

2
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:20.951
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>

3
00:00:20.951 --> 00:00:23.120
<v Speaker 1>I was just checking the twitter APP on </v>
<v Speaker 1>my iphone.</v>

4
00:00:23.121 --> 00:00:23.590
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone.</v>

5
00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.710
<v Speaker 1>Someone tweeted me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually that was like a minute ago.</v>

6
00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.310
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm reading New York Times article </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the Syrian uprising.</v>

7
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.620
<v Speaker 1>A really interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a really devastating to,</v>

8
00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.760
<v Speaker 1>but I'm actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was like a minute ago to now or,</v>

9
00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:37.990
<v Speaker 1>or um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

10
00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.531
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

11
00:00:38.531 --> 00:00:40.390
<v Speaker 1>that actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was 20 minutes ago.</v>

12
00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.230
<v Speaker 1>I guess you can really get lost in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>temple.</v>

13
00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.260
<v Speaker 1>If I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight to 18,</v>

14
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.273
<v Speaker 1>these last few minutes would consist </v>
<v Speaker 1>only of a fraction of the seven and a </v>

15
00:00:50.651 --> 00:00:53.190
<v Speaker 1>half hours a day that I spend with </v>
<v Speaker 1>media.</v>

16
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.380
<v Speaker 1>Do I care?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not really.</v>

17
00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.350
<v Speaker 1>By which I mean of course that there was</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fat chance to them.</v>

18
00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to stop doing seven and a half</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours.</v>

19
00:01:00.251 --> 00:01:01.084
<v Speaker 1>That's from a study conducted by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kaiser Family Foundation in 2009 up </v>

20
00:01:04.211 --> 00:01:07.810
<v Speaker 1>about an hour and a half from the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>study done in 2004.</v>

21
00:01:07.811 --> 00:01:08.644
<v Speaker 1>So now in 2012,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's safe to say that we're </v>

22
00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.870
<v Speaker 1>probably pretty close to eight hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the day into nice even thirds,</v>

23
00:01:13.871 --> 00:01:14.704
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eight hours of the day we sleep eight </v>

24
00:01:16.331 --> 00:01:17.164
<v Speaker 1>hours of the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We consume media like rabbit hungry </v>

25
00:01:19.151 --> 00:01:20.490
<v Speaker 1>wolves and eight hours of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>week,</v>

26
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.820
<v Speaker 1>what do we do for the other eight hours </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the day?</v>

27
00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so</v>

28
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.133
<v Speaker 1>what's to be made of all this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to criticize those who </v>

29
00:01:29.551 --> 00:01:32.700
<v Speaker 1>spend a lot of time with media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clearly your relationship with media,</v>

30
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.830
<v Speaker 1>like everything else is your own thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your own a affair,</v>

31
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.843
<v Speaker 1>but I do think that there's something </v>
<v Speaker 1>missing from the Kaiser Family </v>

32
00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:38.830
<v Speaker 1>Foundation report.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

33
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.180
<v Speaker 1>today's media is social,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means that it consists not only of</v>

34
00:01:42.181 --> 00:01:43.014
<v Speaker 1>consumption but also of expression and </v>
<v Speaker 1>these two things are relentlessly </v>

35
00:01:46.651 --> 00:01:47.484
<v Speaker 1>intertwine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever you consume has been expressed </v>

36
00:01:48.871 --> 00:01:52.470
<v Speaker 1>by someone else and whatever you express</v>
<v Speaker 1>will be consumed by others.</v>

37
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.740
<v Speaker 1>There was a total awareness of this in </v>
<v Speaker 1>social media.</v>

38
00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.770
<v Speaker 1>Facebook and twitter are not journals or</v>
<v Speaker 1>diaries.</v>

39
00:01:58.771 --> 00:01:59.604
<v Speaker 1>Whatever you post on there is posted </v>
<v Speaker 1>with your complete understanding that </v>

40
00:02:02.971 --> 00:02:06.510
<v Speaker 1>others will see it and not only see it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but probably will comment on it and thus</v>

41
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.690
<v Speaker 1>express themselves for your own response</v>
<v Speaker 1>of consumption,</v>

42
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.310
<v Speaker 1>and so a facebook status like a novel or</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Vlog is a request for judgment.</v>

43
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:15.503
<v Speaker 1>Any cereal tweeter who tells you that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>or she doesn't care what other things </v>

44
00:02:17.701 --> 00:02:18.534
<v Speaker 1>should be left at shared expression is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the definition of caring what others </v>

45
00:02:20.911 --> 00:02:21.744
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's such a thing as expression for </v>

46
00:02:22.591 --> 00:02:24.180
<v Speaker 1>its own sake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's what these are for.</v>

47
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.080
<v Speaker 1>The point is that whatever medium of </v>
<v Speaker 1>shared expression you choose will be the</v>

48
00:02:28.081 --> 00:02:30.300
<v Speaker 1>medium by which you are asking to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>judged.</v>

49
00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.460
<v Speaker 1>If all we're getting from you in terms </v>
<v Speaker 1>of expression,</v>

50
00:02:32.461 --> 00:02:33.294
<v Speaker 1>is curling up in bed with the salad and </v>
<v Speaker 1>a movie until the grammy's start to </v>

51
00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.460
<v Speaker 1>finally relaxed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Feel so nice gifts.</v>

52
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.330
<v Speaker 1>Crack was a little too wet for Whitney </v>
<v Speaker 1>Houston.</v>

53
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.730
<v Speaker 1>She did work in on a Saturday night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

54
00:02:41.731 --> 00:02:43.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm to lose work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>homemade crab Rangoon,</v>

55
00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:44.803
<v Speaker 1>or you have to participate relentlessly </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the manifestations of your own </v>

56
00:02:46.561 --> 00:02:48.180
<v Speaker 1>blessings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

57
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:49.043
<v Speaker 1>Don't be surprised if you're treated </v>
<v Speaker 1>equally as simple equally as trey </v>

58
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.470
<v Speaker 1>equally as idiotic.</v>

59
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.633
<v Speaker 1>We should never forget or forgo the </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding that expression from a </v>

60
00:02:56.221 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>conversation to a feature film is always</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult to do.</v>

61
00:02:59.981 --> 00:03:03.700
<v Speaker 1>It well requires a measure of </v>
<v Speaker 1>composition of time and a willingness to</v>

62
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.410
<v Speaker 1>improve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Despite frustrations.</v>

63
00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.590
<v Speaker 1>Your social media personality is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

64
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.410
<v Speaker 1>It's a performance review and maybe for </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

65
00:03:11.411 --> 00:03:13.600
<v Speaker 1>It's easy not to confuse that </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference,</v>

66
00:03:13.601 --> 00:03:14.434
<v Speaker 1>but it's not so easy for all those who </v>
<v Speaker 1>see only this performance and who are </v>

67
00:03:17.021 --> 00:03:17.854
<v Speaker 1>disposed in many ways to treat others as</v>
<v Speaker 1>stereotypical as they can and maybe </v>

68
00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:25.090
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you get frustrated feeling </v>
<v Speaker 1>that others don't understand.</v>

69
00:03:25.091 --> 00:03:27.220
<v Speaker 1>You don't see your respect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you want.</v>

70
00:03:27.221 --> 00:03:28.054
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you feel like you're always coming</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of conversations or arguments with </v>

71
00:03:30.731 --> 00:03:33.580
<v Speaker 1>your point poorly made well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll let you in on a secret.</v>

72
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:34.743
<v Speaker 1>Those who can speak well to the point </v>
<v Speaker 1>and with lucidity practice these people </v>

73
00:03:37.991 --> 00:03:40.000
<v Speaker 1>trip up like everyone else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but less often.</v>

74
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.833
<v Speaker 1>More Times than not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they make their point and come out of </v>

75
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:43.473
<v Speaker 1>even in normal conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling like you have a better </v>

76
00:03:45.521 --> 00:03:48.250
<v Speaker 1>understanding of what they want and who </v>
<v Speaker 1>they are.</v>

77
00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.893
<v Speaker 1>Not everyone is or has to be an artist </v>
<v Speaker 1>that everyone has to write a novel or </v>

78
00:03:52.421 --> 00:03:53.254
<v Speaker 1>make an album,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there is something to be said for a </v>

79
00:03:54.791 --> 00:03:57.400
<v Speaker 1>little bit of reserve when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 1>expression.</v>

80
00:03:57.401 --> 00:03:59.950
<v Speaker 1>That way you can preserve some of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>own mystery,</v>

81
00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.010
<v Speaker 1>some of your own subtlety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can escape some unnecessary judgment</v>

82
00:04:03.011 --> 00:04:06.130
<v Speaker 1>and you can recover the power of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>own voice.</v>

83
00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.010
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>

84
00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.910
<v Speaker 1>Just getting a tweet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What could she possibly be painting?</v>

85
00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.863
<v Speaker 3>Cut.</v>
