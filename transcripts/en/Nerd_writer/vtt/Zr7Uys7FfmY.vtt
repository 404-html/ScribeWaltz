00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.780
<v Speaker 1>Coffee on a Tuesday in block 34.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2
00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.940
<v Speaker 1>so you're annoyed with me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3
00:00:34.941 --> 00:00:38.600
<v Speaker 1>I did drop out of the university there </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a few months with no explanation,</v>

4
00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.910
<v Speaker 1>but I can explain it in 2010.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I graduated from college as a film major</v>

5
00:00:46.601 --> 00:00:47.434
<v Speaker 1>and I was sure sure then that I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be a filmmaker for the rest of </v>

6
00:00:51.101 --> 00:00:51.934
<v Speaker 1>my life that summer I made a film called</v>
<v Speaker 1>I met you once in a dream and I thought </v>

7
00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.370
<v Speaker 1>then it was gonna be the next in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>line of,</v>

8
00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of movies,</v>

9
00:00:59.021 --> 00:01:01.720
<v Speaker 1>but that did work out in the next few </v>
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>

10
00:01:01.721 --> 00:01:05.500
<v Speaker 1>I read a lot of philosophy and wrote my </v>
<v Speaker 1>discourse on truth before leaving Boston</v>

11
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.530
<v Speaker 1>with three friends to take a u shaped </v>
<v Speaker 1>road trip across the country.</v>

12
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.330
<v Speaker 1>And a blue Hyundai Tucson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

13
00:01:10.331 --> 00:01:11.950
<v Speaker 1>I miss that car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I moved to Portland,</v>

14
00:01:11.951 --> 00:01:14.890
<v Speaker 1>Oregon with small teeny tiny crisis of </v>
<v Speaker 1>purpose.</v>

15
00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.470
<v Speaker 1>Worked on a farm for a little while and </v>
<v Speaker 1>came out the other end.</v>

16
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.640
<v Speaker 1>A novel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I grew a beard.</v>

17
00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.220
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I missed that beard.</v>

18
00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.600
<v Speaker 1>I wrote my first book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Big City,</v>

19
00:01:22.601 --> 00:01:27.490
<v Speaker 1>which you can still buy on gumroad.com,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I left Portland when everyone I knew</v>

20
00:01:27.491 --> 00:01:28.270
<v Speaker 1>left it to that.</v>

21
00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:29.103
<v Speaker 1>I was in la for a little while before </v>
<v Speaker 1>moving to Paris where I wrote my second </v>

22
00:01:31.661 --> 00:01:32.860
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all languages,</v>

23
00:01:32.861 --> 00:01:36.220
<v Speaker 1>the rose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is either dying or dead and when I</v>

24
00:01:36.221 --> 00:01:40.260
<v Speaker 1>came back to the states I moved back to </v>
<v Speaker 1>La and try to figure out how to public.</v>

25
00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.120
<v Speaker 1>One day when I got lost in a youtube </v>
<v Speaker 1>wormhole,</v>

26
00:01:43.121 --> 00:01:43.954
<v Speaker 1>I happened to discover the Vlog brothers</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I thought the videos were pretty </v>

27
00:01:46.751 --> 00:01:47.584
<v Speaker 1>fucking cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I figured out that John Green was a </v>

28
00:01:48.731 --> 00:01:49.564
<v Speaker 1>novelist and he was selling out </v>
<v Speaker 1>printings because of his subscribers on </v>

29
00:01:51.821 --> 00:01:52.820
<v Speaker 1>youtube and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

30
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.190
<v Speaker 1>I can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I did.</v>

31
00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.940
<v Speaker 1>I started making videos every week with </v>
<v Speaker 1>an eye towards publishing my books,</v>

32
00:01:57.941 --> 00:02:01.630
<v Speaker 1>but after awhile I just started to want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to make good content for its own sake.</v>

33
00:02:01.631 --> 00:02:02.464
<v Speaker 1>I really liked this youtube thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One day I was in a cafe and I had this </v>

34
00:02:05.681 --> 00:02:06.514
<v Speaker 1>idea for a video for the project for </v>
<v Speaker 1>awesome on the kind fund charity for </v>

35
00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:10.803
<v Speaker 1>getting kids desks in Malawi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was actually created by the last </v>

36
00:02:14.171 --> 00:02:16.330
<v Speaker 1>word with Lawrence O'donnell on MSNBC.</v>

37
00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.193
<v Speaker 1>The video sort of blew up and they heard</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it and then they had me on the </v>

38
00:02:19.431 --> 00:02:21.570
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The night after I was on Lauren's email,</v>

39
00:02:21.571 --> 00:02:23.290
<v Speaker 1>ben asked me if I wanted to go out for </v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee,</v>

40
00:02:23.291 --> 00:02:25.090
<v Speaker 1>so I said yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

41
00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:26.343
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said you should move to New York and </v>

42
00:02:27.041 --> 00:02:27.874
<v Speaker 1>do this video stuff for us and since I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was broke and since I was working as a </v>

43
00:02:30.791 --> 00:02:33.480
<v Speaker 1>telemarketer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was crushing my soul into tiny,</v>

44
00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.840
<v Speaker 1>teeny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tiny little bits of sharks,</v>

45
00:02:35.841 --> 00:02:36.674
<v Speaker 1>a tiny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tiny little pieces of glass that were </v>

46
00:02:37.541 --> 00:02:41.290
<v Speaker 1>cutting me from the inside and since I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was broke and this was basically a dream</v>

47
00:02:41.291 --> 00:02:42.370
<v Speaker 1>job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I accepted.</v>

48
00:02:42.371 --> 00:02:43.204
<v Speaker 1>It.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Took a long time to work out the </v>

49
00:02:43.721 --> 00:02:46.240
<v Speaker 1>particulars and then working them out </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I disappeared from this blog,</v>

50
00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.710
<v Speaker 1>moved to New York City,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of working at 30 rock for MSNBC.</v>

51
00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:51.783
<v Speaker 1>Doing this video stuff would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can sometimes find here and here </v>

52
00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.370
<v Speaker 1>links in the way and now that I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>finally settled in,</v>

53
00:02:57.371 --> 00:03:00.430
