00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.210
<v Speaker 1>Hey everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>welcome to a little impromptu nerd,</v>

2
00:00:05.211 --> 00:00:09.970
<v Speaker 1>writer q and a filmed on my new fisheye </v>
<v Speaker 1>iphone lends attachment,</v>

3
00:00:09.971 --> 00:00:12.640
<v Speaker 1>which I'm really excited about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put on twitter for questions.</v>

4
00:00:12.641 --> 00:00:14.800
<v Speaker 1>You guys put a lot of cool ones in </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

5
00:00:14.801 --> 00:00:19.540
<v Speaker 1>So let's get right down to it at Daemen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Five wants to know what is your research</v>

6
00:00:19.541 --> 00:00:20.840
<v Speaker 1>process like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

7
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:21.893
<v Speaker 1>so my research process has always been </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same and the way that it works is </v>

8
00:00:24.611 --> 00:00:25.890
<v Speaker 1>when I pick a topic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

9
00:00:25.891 --> 00:00:28.240
<v Speaker 1>and that's a whole nother story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I finally choose one,</v>

10
00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.110
<v Speaker 1>I kind of immersed myself in everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I could possibly read about it.</v>

11
00:00:32.111 --> 00:00:33.910
<v Speaker 1>I read articles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>academic journals.</v>

12
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.730
<v Speaker 1>I got to log in from a Grad school </v>
<v Speaker 1>friend of mine.</v>

13
00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:38.650
<v Speaker 1>They'll tell anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

14
00:00:38.651 --> 00:00:41.920
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read as much as I can about it until I</v>

15
00:00:41.921 --> 00:00:44.680
<v Speaker 1>feel sort of comfortable with the issue </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

16
00:00:44.681 --> 00:00:46.810
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I know everything.</v>

17
00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:51.340
<v Speaker 1>And then I kind of let the structure of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what the video is going to be bubbled up</v>

18
00:00:51.341 --> 00:00:53.020
<v Speaker 1>into my head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's always how it works.</v>

19
00:00:53.021 --> 00:00:53.854
<v Speaker 1>Eventually I'll get to a point where the</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure of the video I say we'll just </v>

20
00:00:58.001 --> 00:01:00.370
<v Speaker 1>become apparent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why that is,</v>

21
00:01:00.371 --> 00:01:01.204
<v Speaker 1>but it just happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I'll start to write a going on </v>

22
00:01:03.641 --> 00:01:04.810
<v Speaker 1>from there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

23
00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:05.981
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

24
00:01:05.981 --> 00:01:08.540
<v Speaker 1>the whole script and then edit over it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

25
00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.110
<v Speaker 1>or all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first part of it and think,</v>

26
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.973
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to edit this to know what comes </v>

27
00:01:14.321 --> 00:01:16.330
<v Speaker 1>next.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once I edit this first part,</v>

28
00:01:16.331 --> 00:01:19.870
<v Speaker 1>I'll see what the rhythm is like and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then I can write the next part of it.</v>

29
00:01:19.871 --> 00:01:22.510
<v Speaker 1>So it depends on the topic and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens in different ways.</v>

30
00:01:22.511 --> 00:01:23.170
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

31
00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:24.003
<v Speaker 1>the research processes intensive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I only have like a week or a couple of </v>

32
00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.500
<v Speaker 1>weeks to do the research proper for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>video.</v>

33
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.100
<v Speaker 1>So I dive in heart at Devante wants to </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

34
00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.470
<v Speaker 1>do you have a preferred Stanley Kubrick </v>
<v Speaker 1>film?</v>

35
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.660
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to say 2001.</v>

36
00:01:37.661 --> 00:01:38.494
<v Speaker 1>A space odyssey at the rising tides </v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to know what tips do you have for </v>

37
00:01:41.081 --> 00:01:44.680
<v Speaker 1>people looking to get into video essays </v>
<v Speaker 1>other than just start?</v>

38
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:45.773
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he's referring to a tweet that I put </v>

39
00:01:47.111 --> 00:01:47.944
<v Speaker 1>out recently where I said that so many </v>
<v Speaker 1>people will actually messaged me </v>

40
00:01:50.201 --> 00:01:52.150
<v Speaker 1>everyday to say that they want to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>into this,</v>

41
00:01:52.151 --> 00:01:55.480
<v Speaker 1>but they don't know where to start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my advice is the same for everybody.</v>

42
00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:56.733
<v Speaker 1>It's just start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that might sound a little bit </v>

43
00:01:58.091 --> 00:01:58.924
<v Speaker 1>reductive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's really the best advice that I </v>

44
00:02:01.001 --> 00:02:01.751
<v Speaker 1>could give.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

45
00:02:01.751 --> 00:02:02.584
<v Speaker 1>so many people I know never get past the</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea phase or the conceptualizing phase </v>

46
00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.210
<v Speaker 1>and what creative work requires is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you make something,</v>

47
00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:13.533
<v Speaker 1>finish it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>identify what you didn't like about it </v>

48
00:02:15.401 --> 00:02:17.620
<v Speaker 1>and approve on it in the next one.</v>

49
00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:18.483
<v Speaker 1>Youtube is unique and awesome for that </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason because I get to put a video out </v>

50
00:02:21.941 --> 00:02:22.774
<v Speaker 1>every weekend and every week I look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>it and get a chance to improve a little </v>

51
00:02:26.051 --> 00:02:26.884
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if I had never put something out </v>

52
00:02:27.341 --> 00:02:28.850
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I had delayed,</v>

53
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.670
<v Speaker 1>delayed until,</v>
<v Speaker 1>until the thing was perfect,</v>

54
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.010
<v Speaker 1>I never would have gotten to where I am </v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

55
00:02:33.011 --> 00:02:33.844
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only important thing in the </v>

56
00:02:34.871 --> 00:02:38.080
<v Speaker 1>beginning is that you're confident and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you put something out there.</v>

57
00:02:38.081 --> 00:02:41.050
<v Speaker 1>And then if you know somebody who is </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to do this,</v>

58
00:02:41.051 --> 00:02:41.884
<v Speaker 1>that you give them the encouragement to </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually start because that's the </v>

59
00:02:44.951 --> 00:02:45.784
<v Speaker 1>hardest part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eventually you can give them </v>

60
00:02:47.231 --> 00:02:50.350
<v Speaker 1>constructive criticism when they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>established themselves a little bit.</v>

61
00:02:50.351 --> 00:02:53.490
<v Speaker 1>But in the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>encouragement is key at neo too.</v>

62
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.470
<v Speaker 1>What John Wants to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Expanding beyond nerd writer,</v>

63
00:02:56.471 --> 00:02:59.110
<v Speaker 1>what is your longterm goal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question.</v>

64
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.390
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love the Internet.</v>

65
00:03:01.391 --> 00:03:05.260
<v Speaker 1>I love Youtube and I wouldn't rather be </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing anything else.</v>

66
00:03:05.261 --> 00:03:06.094
<v Speaker 1>It's afforded me the opportunity to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have a career in which my creative </v>

67
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:10.803
<v Speaker 1>output is 100 percent mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They editorial control is 100 percent </v>

68
00:03:14.111 --> 00:03:14.944
<v Speaker 1>mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one else even works on the nerd </v>

69
00:03:15.711 --> 00:03:17.440
<v Speaker 1>writer channel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's really cool.</v>

70
00:03:17.441 --> 00:03:18.274
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to and had conference calls </v>

71
00:03:19.751 --> 00:03:22.300
<v Speaker 1>about potential things and other kinds </v>
<v Speaker 1>of media,</v>

72
00:03:22.301 --> 00:03:23.134
<v Speaker 1>which is exciting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not totally sure that I want to </v>

73
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.980
<v Speaker 1>go those routes and give up the control </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I have here because that has gotten</v>

74
00:03:29.981 --> 00:03:31.900
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were gotten me where I am today.</v>

75
00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:36.400
<v Speaker 1>And people like the Vlog brothers who </v>
<v Speaker 1>have rejected,</v>

76
00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunities in legacy media is a real.</v>

77
00:03:38.891 --> 00:03:39.724
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

78
00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:45.190
<v Speaker 1>the real pioneers for people who want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>stay online at Mad Mozelle wants to know</v>

79
00:03:45.551 --> 00:03:49.660
<v Speaker 1>how to find one's purpose in life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stick to a thing or keep searching.</v>

80
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:54.370
<v Speaker 1>Now this is a huge question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm probably not qualified to answer it,</v>

81
00:03:54.371 --> 00:03:55.204
<v Speaker 1>but as far as purpose goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that there's a real tragedy </v>

82
00:03:58.571 --> 00:03:59.404
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that I think we're obviously </v>

83
00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.000
<v Speaker 1>not given any kind of objective or </v>
<v Speaker 1>cosmic purpose.</v>

84
00:04:04.001 --> 00:04:06.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that that exists or that</v>

85
00:04:06.521 --> 00:04:07.354
<v Speaker 1>you can find that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that even personally there </v>

86
00:04:10.431 --> 00:04:14.440
<v Speaker 1>is nothing that there's no purpose that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have that you don't choose.</v>

87
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.370
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to choose your purpose and that</v>

88
00:04:18.371 --> 00:04:20.050
<v Speaker 1>choice is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty much arbitrary.</v>

89
00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:22.330
<v Speaker 1>People who say that they were born to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>this are born to do that.</v>

90
00:04:22.331 --> 00:04:23.164
<v Speaker 1>I feel like either they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't know that they're lying to </v>

91
00:04:25.211 --> 00:04:26.044
<v Speaker 1>themselves or there's a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>self deception they are going on and </v>

92
00:04:27.731 --> 00:04:29.620
<v Speaker 1>that's really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you come out of college and you don't</v>

93
00:04:29.621 --> 00:04:31.700
<v Speaker 1>know what you want to do and you feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>like I,</v>

94
00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.750
<v Speaker 1>I can't figure out what I want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing,</v>

95
00:04:33.751 --> 00:04:34.840
<v Speaker 1>it's just occurring to me.</v>

96
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.410
<v Speaker 1>It's because nothing will occur to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just have to choose at.</v>

97
00:04:38.411 --> 00:04:39.244
<v Speaker 1>Darren Robertson wants to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen people write off your videos </v>

98
00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.360
<v Speaker 1>as pretentious mostly because of how you</v>
<v Speaker 1>speak in them.</v>

99
00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.300
<v Speaker 1>How do you feel about this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen those comments.</v>

100
00:04:46.301 --> 00:04:47.134
<v Speaker 1>I probably am pretentious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I don't really have that much of a </v>

101
00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.090
<v Speaker 1>response to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

102
00:04:52.091 --> 00:04:53.580
<v Speaker 1>as far as the way that I talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

103
00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:54.423
<v Speaker 1>that's just the way that I talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never ever tried to talk a certain </v>

104
00:04:56.831 --> 00:04:57.664
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People talk a lot about the pauses at </v>

105
00:04:59.111 --> 00:05:00.510
<v Speaker 1>the end of my videos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

106
00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.470
<v Speaker 1>if you're an editor and you've edited </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a long time,</v>

107
00:05:02.471 --> 00:05:03.304
<v Speaker 1>you learn to do things by instinct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then as far as those final lines in </v>

108
00:05:07.421 --> 00:05:08.254
<v Speaker 1>every video go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just the instinct of the rhythm </v>

109
00:05:09.551 --> 00:05:11.120
<v Speaker 1>that I feel works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

110
00:05:11.121 --> 00:05:13.420
<v Speaker 1>I always just go by my editing instinct.</v>

111
00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:14.800
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

112
00:05:14.801 --> 00:05:15.634
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've paid more attention to it as more </v>

113
00:05:16.301 --> 00:05:19.870
<v Speaker 1>people have brought it up and tried to </v>
<v Speaker 1>like make the pauses a little less.</v>

114
00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.801
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

115
00:05:20.801 --> 00:05:23.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just doing whatever I feel is right.</v>

116
00:05:23.111 --> 00:05:24.790
<v Speaker 1>It's all I can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

117
00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:26.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any accusations of,</v>

118
00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:27.243
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of my favorite creators have been </v>

119
00:05:28.301 --> 00:05:30.050
<v Speaker 1>called potential,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm,</v>

120
00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty okay with being put in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>company at Ben Hawkes says,</v>

121
00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:36.580
<v Speaker 1>what about a video of your impressions </v>
<v Speaker 1>on your trip to France last summer?</v>

122
00:05:36.581 --> 00:05:39.650
<v Speaker 1>Why can't believe you remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did make a little video about that and</v>

123
00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:40.513
<v Speaker 1>watch it here at Bryan spargo rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think has been the biggest </v>

124
00:05:43.151 --> 00:05:46.110
<v Speaker 1>tool for your growth and outreach?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Social media,</v>

125
00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.900
<v Speaker 1>word of mouth or your own marketing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The biggest tool for growth and outreach</v>

126
00:05:49.901 --> 00:05:50.734
<v Speaker 1>for me has just been grinding out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>video's pushing through the times in </v>

127
00:05:53.561 --> 00:05:54.394
<v Speaker 1>which nobody was watching in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning and then the plateaus of not </v>

128
00:05:57.801 --> 00:06:00.420
<v Speaker 1>much subscriber growth in the middle </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that,</v>

129
00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:01.293
<v Speaker 1>that I think will happen to everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I try to make my headlines as good </v>

130
00:06:03.561 --> 00:06:04.100
<v Speaker 1>as possible.</v>

131
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.550
<v Speaker 1>I sort of hate headlining,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate clickbait.</v>

132
00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:07.513
<v Speaker 1>I try to do my best to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to sort of walk the line of being not </v>

133
00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:12.830
<v Speaker 1>too click Baity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but being not too boring because now the</v>

134
00:06:12.831 --> 00:06:15.050
<v Speaker 1>truth is people look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

135
00:06:15.051 --> 00:06:19.340
<v Speaker 1>they look at a million links a day and </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can't grab them a little bit with</v>

136
00:06:19.341 --> 00:06:21.230
<v Speaker 1>your headline or your thumbnail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to watch you.</v>

137
00:06:21.231 --> 00:06:22.820
<v Speaker 1>So you think you have to be cognizant of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

138
00:06:22.821 --> 00:06:23.654
<v Speaker 1>And Hank Green actually wrote a great </v>
<v Speaker 1>article on medium where he talks about </v>

139
00:06:26.091 --> 00:06:26.924
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

140
00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:30.950
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't feel bad about clickbait </v>
<v Speaker 1>titles if the content you're giving them</v>

141
00:06:30.951 --> 00:06:33.260
<v Speaker 1>as good work at j dot Williams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jay wants to know,</v>

142
00:06:33.261 --> 00:06:36.050
<v Speaker 1>what are some of your favorite novels?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

143
00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:36.770
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

144
00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:38.300
<v Speaker 1>I have to mention him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Harrison,</v>

145
00:06:38.301 --> 00:06:39.134
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always mentioned he's my favorite </v>

146
00:06:40.521 --> 00:06:41.880
<v Speaker 1>novelist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

147
00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.510
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so obscure.</v>

148
00:06:44.511 --> 00:06:44.991
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

149
00:06:44.991 --> 00:06:45.471
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

150
00:06:45.471 --> 00:06:49.730
<v Speaker 1>it's a real tragedy and he's written a </v>
<v Speaker 1>science fiction and literary fiction.</v>

151
00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:51.680
<v Speaker 1>But I suggest you start with the novel </v>
<v Speaker 1>light,</v>

152
00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:54.470
<v Speaker 1>which is so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think you'll go on to read more of</v>

153
00:06:54.471 --> 00:06:56.420
<v Speaker 1>his after you read that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm also,</v>

154
00:06:56.421 --> 00:06:58.280
<v Speaker 1>I have to mention Lawrence Durrell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is,</v>

155
00:06:58.281 --> 00:07:00.770
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who wrote the Alexandria Quartet and the</v>

156
00:07:00.771 --> 00:07:01.750
<v Speaker 1>Avignon quinten.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

157
00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:04.760
<v Speaker 1>I've read most of what he's written also</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of forgotten novelists,</v>

158
00:07:04.761 --> 00:07:05.594
<v Speaker 1>but his sort of theories and treatments </v>
<v Speaker 1>of personality and friendship and </v>

159
00:07:10.221 --> 00:07:14.060
<v Speaker 1>relationships form the kind of basis of </v>
<v Speaker 1>my philosophy of,</v>

160
00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:19.090
<v Speaker 1>of relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I can't recommend him enough.</v>

161
00:07:19.731 --> 00:07:22.280
<v Speaker 1>So check out Lawrence Darell really good</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff that's stolen.</v>

162
00:07:22.281 --> 00:07:23.114
<v Speaker 1>PVP wants to know which presidential </v>
<v Speaker 1>candidate seems competent this election </v>

163
00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:27.103
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to get into who I support </v>

164
00:07:28.221 --> 00:07:29.054
<v Speaker 1>officially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do really want to recommend a </v>

165
00:07:30.141 --> 00:07:32.850
<v Speaker 1>website called [inaudible] dot org,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

166
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:33.703
<v Speaker 1>in which you are.com</v>
<v Speaker 1>and which you are given questions about </v>

167
00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:37.423
<v Speaker 1>a lot of different issues and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're lined up with the candidate that </v>

168
00:07:40.011 --> 00:07:41.600
<v Speaker 1>most represents your interests.</v>

169
00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:45.770
<v Speaker 1>My sister who took it last week said </v>
<v Speaker 1>that everyone should be required to take</v>

170
00:07:45.771 --> 00:07:46.604
<v Speaker 1>this little survey because I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a big problem with democracy in </v>

171
00:07:49.251 --> 00:07:51.350
<v Speaker 1>our country is that people don't vote </v>
<v Speaker 1>their interests.</v>

172
00:07:51.351 --> 00:07:53.630
<v Speaker 1>They don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

173
00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:58.520
<v Speaker 1>on a granular level what candidate </v>
<v Speaker 1>supports what issue on what level.</v>

174
00:07:58.521 --> 00:08:01.010
<v Speaker 1>And I think knowing those things would </v>
<v Speaker 1>help.</v>

175
00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:01.903
<v Speaker 1>All of us had a break through the noise </v>
<v Speaker 1>and see who will actually represent us </v>

176
00:08:06.021 --> 00:08:10.040
<v Speaker 1>the way we want to be represented at pip</v>
<v Speaker 1>head to says tips for young writers.</v>

177
00:08:10.041 --> 00:08:11.390
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>write more.</v>

178
00:08:11.391 --> 00:08:14.630
<v Speaker 1>I've written hundreds of thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 1>words since I started writing them.</v>

179
00:08:14.631 --> 00:08:15.464
<v Speaker 1>In the beginning it was crap and I knew </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was crap and I hated it because like </v>

180
00:08:18.831 --> 00:08:20.870
<v Speaker 1>Ira glass one said my tastes with so </v>
<v Speaker 1>much better.</v>

181
00:08:20.871 --> 00:08:23.840
<v Speaker 1>I want it to be like the people I love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I couldn't achieve it.</v>

182
00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:25.753
<v Speaker 1>If you write a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you'll see improvement in your </v>

183
00:08:28.191 --> 00:08:31.490
<v Speaker 1>writing way quicker than you think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

184
00:08:31.491 --> 00:08:32.324
<v Speaker 1>it's not gonna happen overnight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but improvement happens when you just </v>

185
00:08:34.911 --> 00:08:37.430
<v Speaker 1>put the work in that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paul John Cannon wants to know,</v>

186
00:08:37.431 --> 00:08:40.310
<v Speaker 1>would you ever consider touring slash </v>
<v Speaker 1>giving talks to promote your videos?</v>

187
00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:41.213
<v Speaker 1>That's actually a great question because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be giving my first Tedx </v>

188
00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:44.623
<v Speaker 1>talk in Pennsylvania,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually near my hometown at Lafayette </v>

189
00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.670
<v Speaker 1>College next month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm really excited about that.</v>

190
00:08:49.671 --> 00:08:52.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be talking about video </v>
<v Speaker 1>essays and what they are.</v>

191
00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:56.020
<v Speaker 1>So I think I will be doing more of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>moving forward and uh,</v>

192
00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:57.960
<v Speaker 1>I just want to make sure that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

193
00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:01.740
<v Speaker 1>I want the speeches to be great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to be taking a week off,</v>

194
00:09:01.741 --> 00:09:03.750
<v Speaker 1>I think this week that you're seeing </v>
<v Speaker 1>this too,</v>

195
00:09:03.751 --> 00:09:04.584
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That ted talk and make sure that it's </v>

<v Speaker 1>really good and up to snuff at social on</v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to know what is your setup,</v>

197
00:09:09.241 --> 00:09:10.440
<v Speaker 1>what programs do you use?</v>

198
00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:14.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm just quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I use final cut pro 10 and then a lot of</v>

199
00:09:14.071 --> 00:09:14.904
<v Speaker 1>people hate that program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Toni Jo at every frame convinced me </v>

200
00:09:17.671 --> 00:09:21.610
<v Speaker 1>to use it and I actually really love it </v>
<v Speaker 1>now and I mean it does everything I need</v>

201
00:09:21.611 --> 00:09:22.141
<v Speaker 1>it to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

202
00:09:22.141 --> 00:09:24.600
<v Speaker 1>and the mic that this is an old Mc and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people ask like,</v>

203
00:09:24.601 --> 00:09:27.150
<v Speaker 1>why is it so beat up around here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because fall off my desk a bunch of</v>

204
00:09:27.151 --> 00:09:28.420
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

205
00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:30.020
<v Speaker 1>it's an old mike from best buy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

206
00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:30.993
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you can get any more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I really like the quality of it at </v>

207
00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:34.423
<v Speaker 1>ballsy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wants to know who is your favorite </v>

208
00:09:35.341 --> 00:09:37.500
<v Speaker 1>youtuber and who you get inspired by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most.</v>

209
00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:38.820
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I just,</v>

210
00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:40.920
<v Speaker 1>I'll split this question into two parts </v>
<v Speaker 1>really quickly.</v>

211
00:09:40.921 --> 00:09:42.420
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a formal level,</v>

212
00:09:42.421 --> 00:09:43.254
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people love him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Casey Neistat is a real inspiration </v>

213
00:09:45.031 --> 00:09:48.840
<v Speaker 1>for me because I think he's doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that he's,</v>

214
00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:49.411
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

215
00:09:49.411 --> 00:09:53.790
<v Speaker 1>he's pioneering a style that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely unique to online video.</v>

216
00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:57.030
<v Speaker 1>That's what I want to see more of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And on a content level,</v>

217
00:09:57.031 --> 00:09:59.940
<v Speaker 1>I love the video essays that box is </v>
<v Speaker 1>making right now.</v>

218
00:09:59.941 --> 00:10:01.760
<v Speaker 1>I think there are sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

219
00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:05.130
<v Speaker 1>they're the most prestige video essays </v>
<v Speaker 1>from a corporation that I've seen.</v>

220
00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.780
<v Speaker 1>I love New York Times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Op Docs are too.</v>

221
00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:09.173
<v Speaker 1>Also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really love every frame of painting </v>

222
00:10:10.501 --> 00:10:13.020
<v Speaker 1>and Adam Westbrook's video essays at </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] Dot TV.</v>

223
00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:15.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll put some more in the description at</v>

224
00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:17.250
<v Speaker 1>Calabasas or wants to know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do like pancakes.</v>

225
00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:18.143
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously Atlanta home age wants to </v>

226
00:10:20.251 --> 00:10:21.660
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what were you doing before youtube?</v>

227
00:10:21.661 --> 00:10:23.520
<v Speaker 1>I might have answered this before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but before,</v>

228
00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:25.350
<v Speaker 1>directly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before I was doing this full time,</v>

229
00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:27.540
<v Speaker 1>was working at discovery discovery </v>
<v Speaker 1>digital network,</v>

230
00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:29.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>producing a show called secret daily,</v>

231
00:10:29.341 --> 00:10:31.770
<v Speaker 1>which I wrote and hosted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was loosely,</v>

232
00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.840
<v Speaker 1>very loosely based on the nerd writer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

233
00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:34.763
<v Speaker 1>they got me from MSNBC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>MSNBC got me from a video that I did a </v>

234
00:10:38.891 --> 00:10:39.724
<v Speaker 1>while ago on the kind fund and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>before that I was just doing odd jobs </v>

235
00:10:42.121 --> 00:10:45.150
<v Speaker 1>and I tell them marketed for car </v>
<v Speaker 1>warranties,</v>

236
00:10:45.151 --> 00:10:46.110
<v Speaker 1>which was so horrible.</v>

237
00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:47.360
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

238
00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:49.370
<v Speaker 1>before that I was in school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

239
00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:50.213
<v Speaker 1>so it's been a wild ride since I </v>
<v Speaker 1>graduated and I'm glad I finally ended </v>

240
00:10:52.801 --> 00:10:53.634
<v Speaker 1>up here working for myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not in an office because I hate offices </v>

241
00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:01.080
<v Speaker 1>so much at Tilghman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trevor wants to know what do you make of</v>

242
00:11:01.081 --> 00:11:03.870
<v Speaker 1>rotten tomatoes effect on modern day </v>
<v Speaker 1>film culture?</v>

243
00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:05.670
<v Speaker 1>That's a great question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

244
00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:06.533
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always check rotten tomatoes before </v>

245
00:11:07.441 --> 00:11:08.274
<v Speaker 1>going to see a movie just because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to spend $15 or $18 with </v>

246
00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:16.530
<v Speaker 1>ticket prices so high on seeing an okay </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>

247
00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:17.603
<v Speaker 1>I think the negative side of that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we lose the ability to see nuance </v>

248
00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:20.633
<v Speaker 1>in our films and see the great things </v>
<v Speaker 1>and bad movies or see the bad things in </v>

249
00:11:24.631 --> 00:11:26.970
<v Speaker 1>good movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

250
00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:32.360
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'll just see nuance when I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>watch it at home at Louis [inaudible] to</v>

251
00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:33.203
<v Speaker 1>know in your opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the best youtube video you </v>

252
00:11:34.441 --> 00:11:34.890
<v Speaker 1>posted.</v>

253
00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:35.723
<v Speaker 1>I really liked the video I did on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Rihanna and dance hall just because it </v>

254
00:11:38.731 --> 00:11:39.564
<v Speaker 1>was a challenge to figure out how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>express those ideas visually and once I </v>

255
00:11:42.331 --> 00:11:44.420
<v Speaker 1>hit on how to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

256
00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:45.683
<v Speaker 1>I was really excited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what is the most fun for me is </v>

257
00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:52.080
<v Speaker 1>experimenting with visual styles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing things that are new,</v>

258
00:11:52.081 --> 00:11:52.914
<v Speaker 1>innovating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>always trying to push the envelope a </v>

259
00:11:54.131 --> 00:11:55.930
<v Speaker 1>little bit to do something that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't done before.</v>

260
00:11:55.931 --> 00:11:56.764
<v Speaker 1>So that one I really loved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really loved my actually death with </v>

261
00:11:59.141 --> 00:12:00.130
<v Speaker 1>dignity video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>

262
00:12:00.131 --> 00:12:02.080
<v Speaker 1>I tried a lot of interesting things </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

263
00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:05.410
<v Speaker 1>Anything that you see for me that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>experimental,</v>

264
00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:08.600
<v Speaker 1>just know that I was having a lot of fun</v>
<v Speaker 1>making it silent.</v>

265
00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:10.450
<v Speaker 1>But sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine months to know if you were a song,</v>

266
00:12:10.451 --> 00:12:11.284
<v Speaker 1>what song would you be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope I'm doing a day in the life by </v>

267
00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:16.900
<v Speaker 1>the Beatles because that's my favorite </v>
<v Speaker 1>song and I'd like to be my favorite song</v>

268
00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:17.740
<v Speaker 1>at Souza.</v>

269
00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:18.573
<v Speaker 1>Eduardo wants to know what's the role of</v>
<v Speaker 1>art and these postmodern filter bubble </v>

270
00:12:21.551 --> 00:12:24.520
<v Speaker 1>internet days and how can we really </v>
<v Speaker 1>connect to each other?</v>

271
00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:28.390
<v Speaker 1>Well that's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love the term postmodern filter.</v>

272
00:12:28.391 --> 00:12:31.060
<v Speaker 1>Bubble Internet days is a great for an </v>
<v Speaker 1>album or a book.</v>

273
00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:33.003
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

274
00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:33.983
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting question because art </v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly doesn't have the weight that it </v>

275
00:12:36.221 --> 00:12:37.480
<v Speaker 1>used to have and there's never going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>

276
00:12:37.481 --> 00:12:40.480
<v Speaker 1>I think a dickens again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

277
00:12:40.481 --> 00:12:42.910
<v Speaker 1>I could make something and the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>world can see it.</v>

278
00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:44.163
<v Speaker 1>It might be a little bit more fleeting </v>
<v Speaker 1>than a past works past novels or past </v>

279
00:12:48.431 --> 00:12:50.650
<v Speaker 1>sort of mediums,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

280
00:12:50.651 --> 00:12:51.484
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a whole new world and we have to </v>

281
00:12:53.291 --> 00:12:54.124
<v Speaker 1>work with the Times that we have as far </v>
<v Speaker 1>as how do we really connect to each </v>

282
00:12:56.231 --> 00:12:57.064
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean got to just make friends and be </v>

283
00:13:00.881 --> 00:13:01.300
<v Speaker 1>with people.</v>

284
00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:01.991
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

285
00:13:01.991 --> 00:13:05.680
<v Speaker 1>Internet is great and I have a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who I communicate with you on the</v>

286
00:13:05.681 --> 00:13:08.500
<v Speaker 1>Internet and people communicate with me </v>
<v Speaker 1>through my videos,</v>

287
00:13:08.501 --> 00:13:09.334
<v Speaker 1>but my actual physical friendships and </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships are the most important </v>

288
00:13:13.841 --> 00:13:17.290
<v Speaker 1>thing to me in the world and we have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultivate those I think because it keeps</v>

289
00:13:17.291 --> 00:13:18.124
<v Speaker 1>us grounded and I love those people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Love My friends at Collin mx 31 wants </v>

290
00:13:21.761 --> 00:13:22.594
<v Speaker 1>to know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you work off a template or have a </v>

291
00:13:24.521 --> 00:13:25.630
<v Speaker 1>formula of some sort?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

292
00:13:25.631 --> 00:13:29.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a template and it would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>no fun for me at all if I did.</v>

293
00:13:29.111 --> 00:13:29.944
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's part of the reason why I </v>
<v Speaker 1>left discovery digital networks because </v>

294
00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:33.333
<v Speaker 1>the strictures of producing one video a </v>
<v Speaker 1>day meant that I then everything had to </v>

295
00:13:36.431 --> 00:13:37.264
<v Speaker 1>be templatized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The editor is only had half a day to </v>

296
00:13:38.981 --> 00:13:41.890
<v Speaker 1>work on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so everything had to look the same every</v>

297
00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:46.300
<v Speaker 1>day and we sort of slotted as script </v>
<v Speaker 1>into this be rolled formula.</v>

298
00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:49.510
<v Speaker 1>That just wasn't interesting to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think every piece of content has to be</v>

299
00:13:49.511 --> 00:13:50.344
<v Speaker 1>mapped with a form that is unique to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At vague solutions wants to know what's </v>

300
00:13:54.281 --> 00:13:56.160
<v Speaker 1>the way to your heart?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

301
00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:57.700
<v Speaker 1>you should probably ask my girlfriend </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>

302
00:13:57.701 --> 00:13:58.534
<v Speaker 1>The amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredible Lisette Videa who hosts d </v>

303
00:14:01.211 --> 00:14:03.940
<v Speaker 1>news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She is the love of my life.</v>

304
00:14:03.941 --> 00:14:04.774
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't possibly love anyone more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she's talented and beautiful and </v>

305
00:14:07.811 --> 00:14:10.450
<v Speaker 1>funny and weird like me in all those </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways.</v>

306
00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:12.010
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so check out her stuff.</v>

307
00:14:12.011 --> 00:14:14.770
<v Speaker 1>I'll link it here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love you at Citizen Austin.</v>

308
00:14:14.771 --> 00:14:15.604
<v Speaker 1>One wants to know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are there any films you could consider </v>

309
00:14:16.571 --> 00:14:17.404
<v Speaker 1>it to be flawless of two films,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big Lebowski and hot fuzz that keep </v>

310
00:14:21.161 --> 00:14:22.360
<v Speaker 1>calm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>read and wants to know.</v>

311
00:14:22.361 --> 00:14:23.194
<v Speaker 1>I read your book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Big City and loved it and he plans on </v>

312
00:14:24.761 --> 00:14:28.330
<v Speaker 1>reading any more novels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I thank you for reading big city.</v>

313
00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:30.280
<v Speaker 1>I sort of cringe when I read that now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

314
00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:32.980
<v Speaker 1>I wrote two novels that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and another one which I never put out,</v>

315
00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:35.680
<v Speaker 1>which I cringe even more to read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

316
00:14:35.681 --> 00:14:36.281
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

317
00:14:36.281 --> 00:14:37.114
<v Speaker 1>I love fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think I love this a little more </v>

318
00:14:39.131 --> 00:14:43.270
<v Speaker 1>and I knew that as I was starting this </v>
<v Speaker 1>channel as learning that.</v>

319
00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:45.820
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a third book that I'm writing now</v>

320
00:14:45.821 --> 00:14:49.180
<v Speaker 1>which is hard side pie and it's so cool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I just don't have the time.</v>

321
00:14:49.181 --> 00:14:50.014
<v Speaker 1>If you've written a novel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that you have to really devote </v>

322
00:14:52.041 --> 00:14:55.310
<v Speaker 1>all your time to it because you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of stay in the story in your mind.</v>

323
00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't have the time to do that now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully sometime in the future.</v>

324
00:14:58.401 --> 00:14:59.234
<v Speaker 1>I'd love for you guys to read it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about like putting it </v>

325
00:15:00.771 --> 00:15:01.604
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>putting it out chapter by chapter and </v>

326
00:15:03.321 --> 00:15:04.130
<v Speaker 1>letting you guys read it.</v>

327
00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:05.060
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think about that?</v>

328
00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:05.923
<v Speaker 1>Let me know in the comments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

329
00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:07.760
<v Speaker 1>Jay Sean wants to know how do you feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>about Internet memes?</v>

330
00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:08.623
<v Speaker 1>Just quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to say that I love Internet </v>

331
00:15:09.621 --> 00:15:14.540
<v Speaker 1>memes and nothing makes me laugh harder </v>
<v Speaker 1>than some of the jokes on imager.</v>

332
00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:16.063
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a whole new form of ultra </v>

333
00:15:18.561 --> 00:15:22.730
<v Speaker 1>aggressive comedy that has ruined me for</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of other kinds of comedy.</v>

334
00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:23.593
<v Speaker 1>And finally at Joseph Wallace wants to </v>
<v Speaker 1>know what are the key components of a </v>

335
00:15:26.361 --> 00:15:27.194
<v Speaker 1>great video essay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you make people care about </v>

336
00:15:29.211 --> 00:15:31.690
<v Speaker 1>something they didn't know before?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

337
00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:32.713
<v Speaker 1>so this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is really my job and I think the </v>

338
00:15:34.641 --> 00:15:36.680
<v Speaker 1>most important thing is that you develop</v>
<v Speaker 1>a narrative,</v>

339
00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:37.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about a,</v>

340
00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:39.650
<v Speaker 1>about a topic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about an issue,</v>

341
00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:42.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can present facts and information,</v>

342
00:15:42.261 --> 00:15:46.580
<v Speaker 1>but I think people really latch onto </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories and that's what I try to do with</v>

343
00:15:46.581 --> 00:15:47.414
<v Speaker 1>every video.</v>

344
00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:49.730
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a metaphor that I love,</v>

345
00:15:49.731 --> 00:15:53.090
<v Speaker 1>which is that I'm on film sets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're a lighting them,</v>

346
00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:53.973
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way that it looks on the set has </v>

347
00:15:55.311 --> 00:15:56.480
<v Speaker 1>nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

348
00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:59.030
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't look anything like the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it looks when you see it on film,</v>

349
00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:00.163
<v Speaker 1>but gaffers and directors of photography</v>
<v Speaker 1>know how that sort of weird code of how </v>

350
00:16:05.961 --> 00:16:08.090
<v Speaker 1>to light something on a set to make it </v>
<v Speaker 1>look a certain way.</v>

351
00:16:08.091 --> 00:16:13.091
<v Speaker 1>You just have to practice and know it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think when I'm doing a video essay</v>

352
00:16:13.311 --> 00:16:14.144
<v Speaker 1>on something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm trying to do is create a kind </v>

353
00:16:15.771 --> 00:16:16.604
<v Speaker 1>of all chemical reaction in the story </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I'm telling that makes you as </v>

354
00:16:19.311 --> 00:16:22.430
<v Speaker 1>inspired about this thing as I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I said before,</v>

355
00:16:22.431 --> 00:16:25.430
<v Speaker 1>these are primers and essays,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means they're short.</v>

356
00:16:25.431 --> 00:16:26.264
<v Speaker 1>So I hope that I've inspired you enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the greatest teachers I've had to </v>

357
00:16:29.451 --> 00:16:31.100
<v Speaker 1>go out and learn more about it.</v>

358
00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:32.203
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I think narrative story is the most </v>

359
00:16:34.221 --> 00:16:37.190
<v Speaker 1>important thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Getting people engaged in something that</v>

360
00:16:37.191 --> 00:16:40.160
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't have thought they could </v>
<v Speaker 1>have liked before.</v>

361
00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:42.230
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was so much fun.</v>

362
00:16:42.231 --> 00:16:43.064
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for asking your questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really appreciated all the questions </v>

363
00:16:45.291 --> 00:16:47.040
<v Speaker 1>you put in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

364
00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:48.223
<v Speaker 1>I'm not that great of an extemporaneous </v>
<v Speaker 1>talker of the nerdwriter is all about </v>

365
00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:52.003
<v Speaker 1>sort of writing and articulating the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I feel about something before </v>

366
00:16:55.131 --> 00:16:55.964
<v Speaker 1>presenting it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the way I like to communicate </v>

367
00:16:58.191 --> 00:16:59.024
<v Speaker 1>normally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think this is a good opportunity </v>

368
00:16:59.871 --> 00:17:00.704
<v Speaker 1>to put a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put a lot of things on record about how </v>

369
00:17:02.241 --> 00:17:03.970
<v Speaker 1>I feel about stuff and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

370
00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:08.270
<v Speaker 1>and I appreciate your interest always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you so much for watching.</v>

371
00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:13.100
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for continuing to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am working my ass off here to make the</v>

372
00:17:13.101 --> 00:17:15.590
<v Speaker 1>best possible video is for you that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>can.</v>

373
00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:17.030
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

374
00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:19.820
