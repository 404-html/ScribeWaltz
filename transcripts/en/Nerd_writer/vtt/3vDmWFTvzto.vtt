00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.220
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>

2
00:00:20.221 --> 00:00:21.890
<v Speaker 1>Tell me what's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on?</v>

3
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.760
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>

4
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.710
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the question that Larry Gopnik,</v>

5
00:00:28.711 --> 00:00:31.890
<v Speaker 1>the ill fated protagonist of the Cohen </v>
<v Speaker 1>Brothers dark comedy.</v>

6
00:00:31.891 --> 00:00:32.724
<v Speaker 1>A serious man keeps asking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a reflexive and sort of stupid </v>

7
00:00:37.051 --> 00:00:37.884
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One in response to a series of </v>

8
00:00:39.691 --> 00:00:43.230
<v Speaker 1>unfortunate events that seem to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>tearing Larry's quiet,</v>

9
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.130
<v Speaker 1>contented suburban life apart without </v>
<v Speaker 1>cause.</v>

10
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.993
<v Speaker 1>First his wife demands a divorce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then his student tries to blackmail him </v>

11
00:00:51.181 --> 00:00:54.450
<v Speaker 1>for a passing grade than his neighbor </v>
<v Speaker 1>infringes on his property.</v>

12
00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.300
<v Speaker 1>Then his wife's lover dies and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>forced to pay for it.</v>

13
00:00:57.301 --> 00:01:00.990
<v Speaker 1>Then his brother gets in trouble with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the law and he has to pay for that too.</v>

14
00:01:00.991 --> 00:01:05.040
<v Speaker 1>Then his chance at tenure is threatened </v>
<v Speaker 1>by anonymous hate mail.</v>

15
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.670
<v Speaker 1>The also gets into a car accident,</v>
<v Speaker 1>witnesses the death of his lawyer and is</v>

16
00:01:08.671 --> 00:01:10.680
<v Speaker 1>forced to pay for a record subscription.</v>

17
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.700
<v Speaker 1>Even though I didn't do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Being a Coen brothers movie,</v>

18
00:01:14.701 --> 00:01:15.534
<v Speaker 1>each of these situations compound and </v>
<v Speaker 1>unfold into one another with surgical </v>

19
00:01:20.131 --> 00:01:20.964
<v Speaker 1>precision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they are each individually </v>

20
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.423
<v Speaker 1>illustrative of their own batch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>themes which taken together a sort of </v>

21
00:01:27.271 --> 00:01:29.820
<v Speaker 1>shape out the central message of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie,</v>

22
00:01:29.821 --> 00:01:33.720
<v Speaker 1>like one of those optical illusions that</v>
<v Speaker 1>demonstrate closure.</v>

23
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:34.703
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is no real closure in a serious </v>

24
00:01:36.391 --> 00:01:37.224
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just as there's not really a shape in </v>

25
00:01:38.851 --> 00:01:41.820
<v Speaker 1>the illusion that doesn't stop Larry </v>
<v Speaker 1>from seeking it,</v>

26
00:01:41.821 --> 00:01:46.320
<v Speaker 1>though he wants to understand what he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>done to deserve such misfortune,</v>

27
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.870
<v Speaker 1>seemingly unaware of what the audience </v>
<v Speaker 1>could see,</v>

28
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.883
<v Speaker 1>clear as day that it's Larry's inaction </v>
<v Speaker 1>is constant refrain of haven't done </v>

29
00:01:53.731 --> 00:01:56.340
<v Speaker 1>anything that causes so many of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>

30
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.410
<v Speaker 1>Larry knows that actions have </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences,</v>

31
00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.610
<v Speaker 1>but inaction has consequences to instead</v>
<v Speaker 1>of grappling with this fact,</v>

32
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.970
<v Speaker 1>Larry looks for a way to interpret his </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering.</v>

33
00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.450
<v Speaker 1>Seeking out the counsel of three rabbis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first,</v>

34
00:02:09.451 --> 00:02:10.284
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>junior rabbi lectures Larry on the </v>

35
00:02:11.611 --> 00:02:14.880
<v Speaker 1>importance of spective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>

36
00:02:14.881 --> 00:02:15.714
<v Speaker 1>Larry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second tells a convoluted parable </v>

37
00:02:17.491 --> 00:02:18.324
<v Speaker 1>about a dentist who finds a message and </v>
<v Speaker 1>a patient's teeth that never resolves </v>

38
00:02:21.781 --> 00:02:24.990
<v Speaker 1>itself illustrating the inscrutability </v>
<v Speaker 1>of God's plan.</v>

39
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.610
<v Speaker 1>And the third rapper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

40
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.473
<v Speaker 1>elderly wise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rabbi Marsha refuses to see him </v>

41
00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.360
<v Speaker 1>altogether,</v>
<v Speaker 1>liberalizing the heavenly silence in the</v>

42
00:02:33.361 --> 00:02:34.194
<v Speaker 1>face of big questions that prompted </v>
<v Speaker 1>Larry Search for advice in the first </v>

43
00:02:37.561 --> 00:02:39.630
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the things that Larry,</v>

44
00:02:39.631 --> 00:02:40.464
<v Speaker 1>heres our cliches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the need to change your </v>

45
00:02:42.571 --> 00:02:44.780
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the parking lot,</v>

46
00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.740
<v Speaker 1>larry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet many of them are true.</v>

47
00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:47.723
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cliche and parable are two devices that </v>

48
00:02:50.161 --> 00:02:50.994
<v Speaker 1>people use to understand what's going on</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're not the only that a serious </v>

49
00:02:55.051 --> 00:02:55.884
<v Speaker 1>man has to offer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Larry Son Danny uses music and so does </v>

50
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.060
<v Speaker 1>their next door neighbor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mrs Samsky.</v>

51
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.133
<v Speaker 1>Larry's brother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uses a complex probability map of the </v>

52
00:03:04.511 --> 00:03:05.344
<v Speaker 1>universe called the mentality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alice and Larry himself teaches the </v>

53
00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:09.154
<v Speaker 1>theories of physics and mathematics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>namely and equation that seems to </v>

54
00:03:12.101 --> 00:03:16.240
<v Speaker 1>definitively prove the underwriting </v>
<v Speaker 1>uncertainty of all things.</v>

55
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.320
<v Speaker 1>I want to concede that it's subtle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clever,</v>

56
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.920
<v Speaker 1>but at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it convincing at its core?</v>

57
00:03:23.921 --> 00:03:24.754
<v Speaker 1>This film questions the persuasiveness </v>
<v Speaker 1>of every interpretive device by placing </v>

58
00:03:29.201 --> 00:03:30.034
<v Speaker 1>them side by side and showing how they </v>
<v Speaker 1>fail to work together and form any kind </v>

59
00:03:33.161 --> 00:03:33.994
<v Speaker 1>of semblance of coherence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The koans communicate the real dread of </v>

60
00:03:37.871 --> 00:03:38.704
<v Speaker 1>a world that's become unreadable and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they take this failure down to the most </v>

61
00:03:42.551 --> 00:03:46.330
<v Speaker 1>basic form of interpretation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the use of language,</v>

62
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.433
<v Speaker 1>a lot of attention is paid to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>language of Hebrew and ancient language </v>

63
00:03:50.171 --> 00:03:53.020
<v Speaker 1>that's lost much of its force in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>modern world.</v>

64
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.760
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even in the 19 sixties,</v>

65
00:03:54.761 --> 00:03:55.594
<v Speaker 1>young Danny Gopnik was doing exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>what I did when faced with a Torah </v>

66
00:03:59.441 --> 00:04:02.680
<v Speaker 1>portion to learn from my bar Mitzvah and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had vinyls.</v>

67
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:03.543
<v Speaker 1>I had tapes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but neither of US learned to read or </v>

68
00:04:06.041 --> 00:04:08.140
<v Speaker 1>understand the Hebrew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

69
00:04:08.141 --> 00:04:10.930
<v Speaker 1>we memorize the sounds that to us remain</v>

70
00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.370
<v Speaker 2>right up share</v>

71
00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:15.413
<v Speaker 1>Danny can't find his place when the time</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes because those symbols are as </v>

72
00:04:18.391 --> 00:04:22.920
<v Speaker 1>incomprehensible as the mentality is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even in English several times in the</v>

73
00:04:22.921 --> 00:04:23.754
<v Speaker 1>film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are asked to repeat things or </v>

74
00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.590
<v Speaker 1>just hear them as nonsense near Sir my </v>
<v Speaker 1>sir nea.</v>

75
00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.823
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so interpretation is how we nailed down </v>

76
00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.360
<v Speaker 1>the world around us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Word by word,</v>

77
00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:40.223
<v Speaker 1>feeble by feeble equation by equation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We secure the storm of experience onto </v>

78
00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:46.733
<v Speaker 1>fixed points,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when these started to come undone </v>

79
00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.170
<v Speaker 1>and unforeseen circumstances are always </v>
<v Speaker 1>threatening to do that,</v>

80
00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:53.483
<v Speaker 1>it can be very traumatic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We like Larry reach for anything that </v>

81
00:04:56.851 --> 00:05:00.120
<v Speaker 1>can orient us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>explains the appeal of religion,</v>

82
00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:05.330
<v Speaker 1>yet a serious man documents it's ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>decreasing usefulness in the modern age.</v>

83
00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:06.623
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this criticism of interpretive methods </v>

84
00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:13.050
<v Speaker 1>ought to make us realize that we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching a form of interpretation,</v>

85
00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.900
<v Speaker 1>the cinematic narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a serious man,</v>

86
00:05:15.901 --> 00:05:16.734
<v Speaker 1>a film in which every element is </v>
<v Speaker 1>ambiguous in which cause and effect the </v>

87
00:05:20.251 --> 00:05:22.950
<v Speaker 1>engine of any narrative is willfully </v>
<v Speaker 1>disregarded.</v>

88
00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:27.060
<v Speaker 1>Suggest that film and story are plagued </v>
<v Speaker 1>by the same problems,</v>

89
00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.073
<v Speaker 1>has all the other devices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite what Hollywood would have you </v>

90
00:05:30.241 --> 00:05:32.460
<v Speaker 1>believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the most confounding things about</v>

91
00:05:32.461 --> 00:05:36.930
<v Speaker 1>the film is it's opening prologue of </v>
<v Speaker 1>short fable filmed in a different aspect</v>

92
00:05:36.931 --> 00:05:41.931
<v Speaker 1>ratio about a Jewish couple in the old </v>
<v Speaker 1>country who stab and maybe kill either a</v>

93
00:05:42.721 --> 00:05:43.554
<v Speaker 1>good Samaritan or a demon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The prologues meaning and its </v>

94
00:05:46.471 --> 00:05:49.710
<v Speaker 1>relationship to the rest of the film are</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally nebulous.</v>

95
00:05:49.711 --> 00:05:53.820
<v Speaker 1>There's just enough the maddix </v>
<v Speaker 1>similarity to prompt interpretation,</v>

96
00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:55.133
<v Speaker 1>but once you try,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only outcome can frustration moving </v>

97
00:05:58.521 --> 00:06:03.050
<v Speaker 1>the viewer into a head space like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is neither pretentious nor unwieldy.</v>

98
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:08.200
<v Speaker 1>It's the effect of a subtle experienced </v>
<v Speaker 1>and masterful craftsmanship and the Coen</v>

99
00:06:08.661 --> 00:06:11.730
<v Speaker 1>brothers have been doing this for years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just didn't understand,</v>

100
00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:13.023
<v Speaker 1>but a serious man is there most explicit</v>
<v Speaker 1>account of oblique but unflinching </v>

101
00:06:17.301 --> 00:06:17.990
<v Speaker 1>philosophy.</v>

102
00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.823
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One that remains skeptical about the </v>

103
00:06:21.591 --> 00:06:22.424
<v Speaker 1>things we believe film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>story and interpretation can do and </v>

104
00:06:26.781 --> 00:06:27.614
<v Speaker 1>understands that the big philosophical </v>
<v Speaker 1>truths about human life are </v>

105
00:06:31.131 --> 00:06:35.390
<v Speaker 1>devastatingly symbol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no god.</v>

106
00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.690
<v Speaker 1>There is no objective or cosmic purpose </v>
<v Speaker 1>for us.</v>

107
00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:41.630
<v Speaker 1>People experience joy to varying </v>
<v Speaker 1>degrees,</v>

108
00:06:41.631 --> 00:06:42.464
<v Speaker 1>but everybody suffers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyone can figure these things out with </v>

109
00:06:45.451 --> 00:06:48.770
<v Speaker 1>the small amount of observation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>introspection and study,</v>

110
00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:53.480
<v Speaker 1>and once you do that dim feeling of </v>
<v Speaker 1>disappointment will always be there,</v>

111
00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:58.250
<v Speaker 1>but there should also be relief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The kind of relief you can only get when</v>

112
00:06:58.251 --> 00:06:59.084
<v Speaker 1>putting aside questions that are really </v>
<v Speaker 1>a waste of time because only when the </v>

113
00:07:03.291 --> 00:07:04.124
<v Speaker 1>reflexive and sort of stupid questions </v>
<v Speaker 1>are dropped and the better questions be </v>

114
00:07:08.871 --> 00:07:11.420
<v Speaker 1>asked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Better questions like whether or not</v>

115
00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:12.433
<v Speaker 3>mine.</v>

116
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:24.800
<v Speaker 1>Hey everybody,</v>
