00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:07.900
<v Speaker 1>Proliferation of nuclear weapons is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>detestable artifact of human beings,</v>

2
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:14.140
<v Speaker 1>seemingly ineradicable desire to </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominate other human beings.</v>

3
00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:15.043
<v Speaker 1>Nuclear weapons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps more than any other manmade </v>

4
00:00:17.661 --> 00:00:18.494
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>represent that uneasy dichotomy between </v>

5
00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:22.003
<v Speaker 1>the brilliant scientific creativity of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>technological achievement and the </v>

6
00:00:25.821 --> 00:00:29.630
<v Speaker 1>consequences of its function,</v>
<v Speaker 1>its attention that's been explored by so</v>

7
00:00:29.631 --> 00:00:34.460
<v Speaker 1>many thinkers and moralists even by some</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the scientists who work themselves on</v>

8
00:00:34.461 --> 00:00:36.830
<v Speaker 1>the famous or infamous Manhattan.</v>

9
00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.530
<v Speaker 2>The only reaction I remember perhaps I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was blinded by my own reaction,</v>

10
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:41.883
<v Speaker 2>was very considerable elation and </v>
<v Speaker 2>excitement and I was going to parties </v>

11
00:00:47.041 --> 00:00:52.041
<v Speaker 2>and people got drunk and it would make a</v>
<v Speaker 2>tremendous interesting contrast what was</v>

12
00:00:58.021 --> 00:01:02.130
<v Speaker 2>going on in Los Alamos at the same time </v>
<v Speaker 2>as what was going on in Hiroshima.</v>

13
00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:03.093
<v Speaker 1>Nuclear weapons have been tested over </v>
<v Speaker 1>2000 times since little boy and fat men </v>

14
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.393
<v Speaker 1>were dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima </v>
<v Speaker 1>for tests and demonstrations for civil </v>

15
00:01:13.811 --> 00:01:15.490
<v Speaker 1>engineering purposes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>moving land,</v>

16
00:01:15.491 --> 00:01:17.710
<v Speaker 1>creating artificial bays,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things like that.</v>

17
00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.910
<v Speaker 1>There was even an extended US military </v>
<v Speaker 1>operation called operation.</v>

18
00:01:21.911 --> 00:01:26.410
<v Speaker 1>Plowshare started in 1958 at the height </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the atomic age,</v>

19
00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.070
<v Speaker 1>which aim to exploit the quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>friendly Adam.</v>

20
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.933
<v Speaker 1>Plowshare saw the explosion of 35 </v>
<v Speaker 1>nuclear bombs until public outcry shut </v>

21
00:01:35.441 --> 00:01:36.274
<v Speaker 1>the program down in 1975.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The nuclear industry wanted to </v>

22
00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.083
<v Speaker 1>desensitize the public to the negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>connotations associated with nuclear </v>

23
00:01:44.051 --> 00:01:44.884
<v Speaker 1>weapons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the problem was that those negative </v>

24
00:01:47.051 --> 00:01:51.670
<v Speaker 1>connotations were present in every step </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the program.</v>

25
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:52.533
<v Speaker 1>Project GNOME vented radioactive steam </v>
<v Speaker 1>over the very press gallery that was </v>

26
00:01:56.381 --> 00:01:58.870
<v Speaker 1>called to confirm it safety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next blast,</v>

27
00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:59.763
<v Speaker 1>104 kiloton detonation at UCO.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Flat Nevada displays 12 million tons of </v>

28
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.130
<v Speaker 1>soil and resulted in a radioactive dust </v>
<v Speaker 1>cloud that rose 12,000</v>

29
00:02:09.131 --> 00:02:11.920
<v Speaker 1>feet and plume toward the Mississippi </v>
<v Speaker 1>River.</v>

30
00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:12.783
<v Speaker 1>You can read all about operation plow </v>
<v Speaker 1>share in the Department of Energy's </v>

31
00:02:15.311 --> 00:02:18.580
<v Speaker 1>executive summary of the program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I'll put in the description below.</v>

32
00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:19.593
<v Speaker 1>Even now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they seem to talk about it with a kind </v>

33
00:02:21.041 --> 00:02:21.874
<v Speaker 1>of what could have been disappointed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plowshare and the hundreds of other </v>

34
00:02:25.481 --> 00:02:26.314
<v Speaker 1>nuclear tests that have been done since </v>
<v Speaker 1>its termination deal in the super </v>

35
00:02:29.861 --> 00:02:33.580
<v Speaker 1>violent production of fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 1>particles that have a real,</v>

36
00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.690
<v Speaker 1>almost unbelievable impact on </v>
<v Speaker 1>environmental makeup.</v>

37
00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:38.613
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the creation of new chemical elements </v>

38
00:02:40.181 --> 00:02:41.014
<v Speaker 1>like Einsteinian from and were the </v>
<v Speaker 1>result of the first thermo nuclear </v>

39
00:02:44.291 --> 00:02:49.291
<v Speaker 1>explosion code named Ivy Mike in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen 52 nuclear blast create so much</v>

40
00:02:50.171 --> 00:02:54.580
<v Speaker 1>change in the environment that their </v>
<v Speaker 1>fingerprint can be felt in fields.</v>

41
00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.550
<v Speaker 1>On the opposite end of the academic </v>
<v Speaker 1>spectrum,</v>

42
00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.690
<v Speaker 1>in 2008 occurred to Russian avant garde </v>
<v Speaker 1>painting expert Alaina Baster,</v>

43
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:02.733
<v Speaker 1>then curator of the Russian museum in St</v>
<v Speaker 1>Petersburg inundated with a booming </v>

44
00:03:06.521 --> 00:03:07.354
<v Speaker 1>forgery market that have scientists </v>
<v Speaker 1>chemically tested the paint in </v>

45
00:03:10.991 --> 00:03:12.310
<v Speaker 1>suspicious canvases.</v>

46
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:13.623
<v Speaker 1>They might find something in its makeup </v>
<v Speaker 1>which dated the pieces more accurately </v>

47
00:03:17.891 --> 00:03:18.724
<v Speaker 1>than other methods using a mass </v>
<v Speaker 1>spectrometer basner and some </v>

48
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.640
<v Speaker 1>artistically minded scientists were able</v>
<v Speaker 1>to see that to isotope caesium 1:37</v>

49
00:03:27.341 --> 00:03:28.174
<v Speaker 1>and strontium 90 appeared in greater </v>
<v Speaker 1>concentration in canvases from after </v>

50
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.420
<v Speaker 1>1945 when the first nuclear weapons were</v>
<v Speaker 1>detonated.</v>

51
00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.313
<v Speaker 1>These radioactive vision products are </v>
<v Speaker 1>ejected from nuclear blast into the </v>

52
00:03:42.911 --> 00:03:45.820
<v Speaker 1>atmosphere and absorbed into earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>soil,</v>

53
00:03:45.821 --> 00:03:46.654
<v Speaker 1>and then Earth's plant life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>namely flax plants from which we get </v>

54
00:03:49.871 --> 00:03:54.871
<v Speaker 1>flaxseed oil or linseed oil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a major bonding agent and oil paints.</v>

55
00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:56.793
<v Speaker 1>This fills me with such an odd feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost all post 1945 oil paintings </v>

56
00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.400
<v Speaker 1>contain a fingerprint of nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 1>weapons.</v>

57
00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.013
<v Speaker 1>Remember that next time you go to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>local gallery or if ever you lose faith </v>

58
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:12.183
<v Speaker 1>in the ironic interconnectedness of all </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that within our most refined </v>

59
00:04:17.771 --> 00:04:22.540
<v Speaker 1>creative impulse lurks traces of are </v>
<v Speaker 1>equally refined,</v>

60
00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.110
<v Speaker 1>exact opposite impulse for destruction.</v>

61
00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:28.790
<v Speaker 1>Hey everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thanks for watching.</v>

62
00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:29.653
<v Speaker 1>There are so many tangents I could have </v>
<v Speaker 1>gone down with this video and I want it </v>

63
00:04:32.751 --> 00:04:34.070
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just didn't want to make it too long,</v>

64
00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:35.263
<v Speaker 1>but I put a lot of the links and sources</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the description under works cited so </v>

65
00:04:38.811 --> 00:04:39.644
<v Speaker 1>you can read for yourself some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cool stuff about operation cloudshare </v>

66
00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:45.410
<v Speaker 1>about nuclear weapons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fishing products,</v>

67
00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.230
<v Speaker 1>art forgeries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just a lot of cool things.</v>

68
00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.393
<v Speaker 1>Thank you to everybody who followed me </v>
<v Speaker 1>on Tumbler and used the ask me anything </v>

69
00:04:52.641 --> 00:04:56.030
<v Speaker 1>feature to have some discussions about </v>
<v Speaker 1>some cool stuff about this video,</v>

70
00:04:56.031 --> 00:04:59.240
<v Speaker 1>but other videos I encourage you to keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing that.</v>

71
00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.313
<v Speaker 1>Tumbler is really cool for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for doing sort of longer discussions </v>

72
00:05:04.071 --> 00:05:06.230
<v Speaker 1>about things and I'll see you next week.</v>
