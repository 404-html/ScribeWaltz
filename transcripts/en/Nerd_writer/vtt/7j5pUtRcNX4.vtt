00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.210
<v Speaker 1>Edward hopper is a special artist for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of us.</v>

2
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.370
<v Speaker 1>I've always thought of him in a sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>romantic way because his paintings evoke</v>

3
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.400
<v Speaker 1>the same kind of feelings and memories </v>
<v Speaker 1>in me that I get from the sense of smell</v>

4
00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.740
<v Speaker 1>is if he was channeling directly into my</v>
<v Speaker 1>limbic system,</v>

5
00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.750
<v Speaker 1>excavating moments that were stored </v>
<v Speaker 1>deeply away,</v>

6
00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:33.813
<v Speaker 1>a stubborn realist throughout the mini </v>
<v Speaker 1>changing and often abstract currents of </v>

7
00:00:36.581 --> 00:00:38.980
<v Speaker 1>modern art in the early and mid 20th </v>
<v Speaker 1>century.</v>

8
00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.920
<v Speaker 1>His canvases are clean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smooth,</v>

9
00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:43.003
<v Speaker 1>and almost too real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not real like his contemporary Andrew </v>

10
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:47.531
<v Speaker 1>Wyeth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

11
00:00:47.531 --> 00:00:48.364
<v Speaker 1>who strive for detail and photo realism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but pulled back by one degree into </v>

12
00:00:53.021 --> 00:00:55.570
<v Speaker 1>depictions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slightly more generalized,</v>

13
00:00:55.571 --> 00:00:59.890
<v Speaker 1>slightly more detached from place </v>
<v Speaker 1>history and person in this way.</v>

14
00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.000
<v Speaker 1>There's just enough room to put your own</v>
<v Speaker 1>life into hopper's work,</v>

15
00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:05.103
<v Speaker 1>but once inside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's impossible not to be closed in and </v>

16
00:01:07.631 --> 00:01:10.840
<v Speaker 1>see that life along his themes.</v>

17
00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.110
<v Speaker 1>Nearly all those themes are present in </v>
<v Speaker 1>nighthawks.</v>

18
00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.370
<v Speaker 1>Unquestionably the artists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most famous work themes of loneliness,</v>

19
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.140
<v Speaker 1>alienation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>voyeurism,</v>

20
00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.000
<v Speaker 1>quiet contemplation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and more.</v>

21
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.480
<v Speaker 1>The scene depicts for people in New York</v>
<v Speaker 1>City diner at night.</v>

22
00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.540
<v Speaker 1>It's meant to be somewhere in Greenwich </v>
<v Speaker 1>village where hopper lived,</v>

23
00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:29.553
<v Speaker 1>but decades of exhaustive searching have</v>
<v Speaker 1>concluded that it was never a real </v>

24
00:01:32.591 --> 00:01:33.424
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was one waiter and three patrons </v>

25
00:01:35.531 --> 00:01:36.364
<v Speaker 1>who is relationships are all ambiguous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seated so close together in an empty </v>

26
00:01:39.851 --> 00:01:40.684
<v Speaker 1>diner at night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's likely that these two know each </v>

27
00:01:42.581 --> 00:01:45.280
<v Speaker 1>other somehow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but though their hands overlap,</v>

28
00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.730
<v Speaker 1>they don't touch and they're in </v>
<v Speaker 1>different phases suggest that they could</v>

29
00:01:48.731 --> 00:01:52.640
<v Speaker 1>be strangers if not just momentarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>estranged.</v>

30
00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.003
<v Speaker 1>The main character of the piece seems to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be the diner itself and island of light </v>

31
00:01:57.371 --> 00:01:58.204
<v Speaker 1>in the outer darkness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's diagonal lines are strong </v>

32
00:02:00.881 --> 00:02:01.714
<v Speaker 1>accentuated by the counter and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stools and we're seeing the diner at an </v>

33
00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.860
<v Speaker 1>odd angle as if from the vantage of </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone crossing the street,</v>

34
00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.300
<v Speaker 1>it's triangular corner juts into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>frame like the prow of a boat,</v>

35
00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:14.530
<v Speaker 1>and this is no coincidence.</v>

36
00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.560
<v Speaker 1>Not only was hopper obsessed with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagery of boats,</v>

37
00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:18.603
<v Speaker 1>but he repeatedly situated his buildings</v>
<v Speaker 1>at angles like this and the point of </v>

38
00:02:22.481 --> 00:02:23.314
<v Speaker 1>that I think was to achieve and effect </v>
<v Speaker 1>in which his subjects were both behind </v>

39
00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.950
<v Speaker 1>and in front of windows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

40
00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.843
<v Speaker 1>windows are the place where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>separation between outside and inside </v>

41
00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.050
<v Speaker 1>becomes complicated and not because we </v>
<v Speaker 1>can physically move through them,</v>

42
00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.943
<v Speaker 1>but because our site does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because our gaze invades these private </v>

43
00:02:42.881 --> 00:02:44.860
<v Speaker 1>worlds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indeed in hopper's work,</v>

44
00:02:44.861 --> 00:02:45.694
<v Speaker 1>the windows often appear as if they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not even there as opposed to someone </v>

45
00:02:49.211 --> 00:02:52.060
<v Speaker 1>like Norman Rockwell who had a talent </v>
<v Speaker 1>for giving glass,</v>

46
00:02:52.061 --> 00:02:56.980
<v Speaker 1>a texture hoppers windows vanish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They invite that voyeuristic look,</v>

47
00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.390
<v Speaker 1>knowing that houses like people can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>penetrated with a gaze.</v>

48
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.320
<v Speaker 1>Copper was a very slow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very deliberate painter.</v>

49
00:03:05.321 --> 00:03:09.550
<v Speaker 1>He took months to finish a canvas and </v>
<v Speaker 1>made several sketches and studies before</v>

50
00:03:09.551 --> 00:03:13.170
<v Speaker 1>embarking on the final piece in these </v>
<v Speaker 1>sketches for Nighthawks,</v>

51
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.013
<v Speaker 1>we can see hopper out on the street </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking for the right back angle for </v>

52
00:03:17.321 --> 00:03:20.350
<v Speaker 1>this man modifying to find the perfect </v>
<v Speaker 1>effect.</v>

53
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:23.110
<v Speaker 1>Here's his sketches of Josephine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his wife,</v>

54
00:03:23.111 --> 00:03:25.000
<v Speaker 1>who modeled for the woman in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>painting.</v>

55
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.460
<v Speaker 1>Here's her right hand holding a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cigarette,</v>

56
00:03:27.461 --> 00:03:31.000
<v Speaker 1>which he eventually transplanted to her </v>
<v Speaker 1>partner hopper,</v>

57
00:03:31.001 --> 00:03:31.834
<v Speaker 1>wanted his devotion to each work to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>mirrored by our appreciation as slowly </v>

58
00:03:36.401 --> 00:03:37.234
<v Speaker 1>and deliberately as he painted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wanted us to look really look to be </v>

59
00:03:41.291 --> 00:03:45.850
<v Speaker 1>made vulnerable as a viewer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>always is whether he or she is crouching</v>

60
00:03:45.851 --> 00:03:49.870
<v Speaker 1>in the dark and the building opposite or</v>
<v Speaker 1>simply crossing the street.</v>

61
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.360
<v Speaker 1>There's no door to the diner and </v>
<v Speaker 1>nighthawks,</v>

62
00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:53.403
<v Speaker 1>no way in except by way of site.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That site enters the fluorescent light </v>

63
00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.923
<v Speaker 1>of the establishment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>passes through the three patrons in </v>

64
00:04:00.881 --> 00:04:01.714
<v Speaker 1>there on wheat and loneliness and exits </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the dark for bidding night behind </v>

65
00:04:05.861 --> 00:04:06.694
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know I,</v>

66
00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:07.563
<v Speaker 1>I wonder about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Darkness hopper tried very hard to on </v>

67
00:04:10.541 --> 00:04:13.030
<v Speaker 1>more his work from the historical </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>

68
00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.750
<v Speaker 1>You didn't want only to be judged in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>context of his time and place,</v>

69
00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:18.133
<v Speaker 1>but it's worth noting that this painting</v>
<v Speaker 1>was completed in the weeks and days </v>

70
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.233
<v Speaker 1>following the bombing of Pearl Harbor </v>
<v Speaker 1>when everyone in New York City was </v>

71
00:04:24.971 --> 00:04:25.804
<v Speaker 1>paranoid about another attack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the city held blackout drills a way to </v>

72
00:04:29.261 --> 00:04:33.190
<v Speaker 1>practice hiding the city in darkness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If an aerial assault ever came,</v>

73
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.940
<v Speaker 1>but hopper didn't care,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his studio lights stayed on.</v>

74
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.833
<v Speaker 1>As his wife wrote in her diary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ed refuses to take any interest in the </v>

75
00:04:41.411 --> 00:04:42.244
<v Speaker 1>very likely prospect of being bombed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was the atmosphere in which night </v>

76
00:04:46.351 --> 00:04:47.184
<v Speaker 1>hawks was Ford.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did it have an influence on the </v>

77
00:04:49.181 --> 00:04:50.590
<v Speaker 1>painting?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

78
00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.370
<v Speaker 1>The future was very uncertain at this </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment in time,</v>

79
00:04:54.371 --> 00:04:58.720
<v Speaker 1>as uncertain as the darkness that frames</v>
<v Speaker 1>the patrons of the Steiner,</v>

80
00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.900
<v Speaker 1>a darkness there launched into by </v>
<v Speaker 1>hoppers composition and our gaze.</v>

81
00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.230
<v Speaker 1>The artist was obsessed with light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how it fell on houses,</v>

82
00:05:08.231 --> 00:05:09.850
<v Speaker 1>on people through windows.</v>

83
00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:10.713
<v Speaker 1>The colors that made hopper seemed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>disregard the chaos in the world around </v>

84
00:05:14.021 --> 00:05:14.854
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but is it a coincidence that like his </v>

85
00:05:16.481 --> 00:05:18.520
<v Speaker 1>studio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the light of the nighthawk,</v>

86
00:05:18.521 --> 00:05:22.030
<v Speaker 1>Steiner seems to be the last light still</v>
<v Speaker 1>shining in the city,</v>

87
00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:23.573
<v Speaker 1>and for this reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you can find a slightly more </v>

88
00:05:25.541 --> 00:05:30.220
<v Speaker 1>optimistic reading of this painting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is there to do in the face of great</v>

89
00:05:30.221 --> 00:05:35.110
<v Speaker 1>disquiet and doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but work and live on all the poppers.</v>

90
00:05:35.111 --> 00:05:37.990
<v Speaker 1>People seem to be huddled up against the</v>
<v Speaker 1>present moment.</v>

91
00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:39.340
<v Speaker 1>Lonely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

92
00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:43.510
<v Speaker 1>Waiting maybe a little board people have</v>
<v Speaker 1>nighthawks are no different,</v>

93
00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:49.140
<v Speaker 1>but boredom is exactly when we feel time</v>
<v Speaker 1>and being the most acutely.</v>

94
00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:51.123
<v Speaker 1>It can inspire a profound mood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's what these people are </v>

95
00:05:54.251 --> 00:05:57.560
<v Speaker 1>feeling alone together in their lighted </v>
<v Speaker 1>ship,</v>

96
00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.980
<v Speaker 1>sailing against the darkness of all that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was yet to come.</v>

97
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:02.623
<v Speaker 1>The yellowish greenish fluorescent light</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this scene like the light and hopper </v>

98
00:06:06.171 --> 00:06:10.130
<v Speaker 1>studio is a meager substitute for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>brilliance of the sun,</v>

99
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:16.300
<v Speaker 1>but it can through giant windows still </v>
<v Speaker 1>illuminated the world.</v>

100
00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.540
<v Speaker 1>Hey everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for watching.</v>

101
00:06:22.541 --> 00:06:24.550
<v Speaker 1>Nighthawks is one of my favorite </v>
<v Speaker 1>paintings ever.</v>

102
00:06:24.551 --> 00:06:28.720
<v Speaker 1>So that was just a lot of fun to make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So two big announcements.</v>

103
00:06:28.721 --> 00:06:32.170
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are about to hit 100,000</v>

104
00:06:32.171 --> 00:06:35.290
<v Speaker 1>subscribers on the nerd writer channel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be at 100,000</v>

105
00:06:35.291 --> 00:06:36.460
<v Speaker 1>by the time this video goes out.</v>

106
00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:39.320
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

107
00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:43.670
<v Speaker 1>that's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been doing this for over four years</v>

108
00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:44.563
<v Speaker 1>and it's been amazing and fun and </v>
<v Speaker 1>exciting and fascinating from the very </v>

109
00:06:49.971 --> 00:06:51.920
<v Speaker 1>start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So thank you to everyone who's been with</v>

110
00:06:51.921 --> 00:06:55.100
<v Speaker 1>me from the beginning,</v>

111
00:06:55.101 --> 00:06:56.330
<v Speaker 1>between.</v>

00:07:02.451 --> 00:07:03.284
<v Speaker 1>So there's gonna be a lot more of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other big news is that we crossed </v>
