1
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.480
<v Speaker 1>Like artists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>filmmakers have a unique set of tools at</v>

2
00:00:06.481 --> 00:00:07.980
<v Speaker 1>their disposal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cameras,</v>

3
00:00:07.981 --> 00:00:09.090
<v Speaker 1>lenses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lights,</v>

4
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.260
<v Speaker 1>microphones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>music,</v>

5
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.920
<v Speaker 1>and they use these tools to tell their </v>
<v Speaker 1>story or set a scene.</v>

6
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.730
<v Speaker 1>The director,</v>
<v Speaker 1>David Lynch has of course the same tools</v>

7
00:00:17.731 --> 00:00:18.564
<v Speaker 1>as everybody else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but lynch manipulates more than just </v>

8
00:00:21.331 --> 00:00:22.164
<v Speaker 1>these physical instruments more deeply </v>
<v Speaker 1>and more strangely than any other </v>

9
00:00:25.921 --> 00:00:29.970
<v Speaker 1>director I know of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He uses expectation as a tool.</v>

10
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.013
<v Speaker 1>He wields expectation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the expectation that comes from what we </v>

11
00:00:33.361 --> 00:00:35.430
<v Speaker 1>know about film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about its history,</v>

12
00:00:35.431 --> 00:00:36.264
<v Speaker 1>the history of stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and from our humanity with the same </v>

13
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.893
<v Speaker 1>nuance and power and someone else might </v>
<v Speaker 1>use light to create a variety of moods </v>

14
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.533
<v Speaker 1>in a space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today I want to look at how Lynch </v>

15
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.760
<v Speaker 1>manipulates our expectations in a single</v>
<v Speaker 1>scene from his masterpiece.</v>

16
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.810
<v Speaker 1>Mulholland drive the guidance towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>some interesting emotional territory.</v>

17
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.140
<v Speaker 1>Let's scene I'm talking about is one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>my favorite ever.</v>

18
00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.290
<v Speaker 1>The audition scene where betty played by</v>
<v Speaker 1>Naomi Watts,</v>

19
00:01:01.291 --> 00:01:02.124
<v Speaker 1>tries out for a part in a small movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We later learn is called the Sylvia </v>

20
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:06.803
<v Speaker 1>North Story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The scene occurs about halfway through </v>

21
00:01:08.311 --> 00:01:09.144
<v Speaker 1>the film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Betty has come to Hollywood bright eyed </v>

22
00:01:11.011 --> 00:01:12.900
<v Speaker 1>and bushy tailed to be a movie star.</v>

23
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:13.361
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>

24
00:01:13.361 --> 00:01:15.730
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather be known as a great actress </v>
<v Speaker 2>than a movie star,</v>

25
00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.310
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes people end up being both.</v>

26
00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.320
<v Speaker 1>She's staying at her aunt's house where </v>
<v Speaker 1>she discovers Rita,</v>

27
00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:22.243
<v Speaker 1>a woman who's been in a car accident and</v>
<v Speaker 1>has lost all her memory or expectations </v>

28
00:01:25.371 --> 00:01:26.204
<v Speaker 1>for the audition have already been set </v>
<v Speaker 1>up by much of what we've witnessed </v>

29
00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.053
<v Speaker 1>leading up to the scene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Betty doesn't seem to be a character </v>

30
00:01:31.341 --> 00:01:32.174
<v Speaker 1>with much internal depth or darkness or </v>
<v Speaker 1>flatness of affect is even parodied in </v>

31
00:01:36.621 --> 00:01:40.460
<v Speaker 1>her very first scene at the airport </v>
<v Speaker 1>where the dialogue is clearly overdubbed</v>

32
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.050
<v Speaker 1>and fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

33
00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.903
<v Speaker 1>Irene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the day her blind kindness makes her </v>

34
00:01:45.801 --> 00:01:46.634
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable to exploitation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't even really care that a </v>

35
00:01:49.281 --> 00:01:53.960
<v Speaker 1>stranger is living in her aunt's house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So coming into the audition were feeling</v>

36
00:01:53.961 --> 00:01:56.900
<v Speaker 1>a couple of things were somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 1>invested in Betty success.</v>

37
00:01:56.901 --> 00:01:57.734
<v Speaker 1>A basic expectation for any protagonist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're wary of some danger that may </v>

38
00:02:02.381 --> 00:02:03.214
<v Speaker 1>be in store because of her innocence and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have little or no expectation that </v>

39
00:02:06.681 --> 00:02:09.080
<v Speaker 1>she will impress with her acting chops.</v>

40
00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.090
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you join woody over there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll play the scene,</v>

41
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.313
<v Speaker 1>and of course the last thing to mention </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that we've already seen this scene </v>

42
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.830
<v Speaker 1>played out once before back at the house</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a practice round,</v>

43
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.440
<v Speaker 1>a tryout for a trial with betty and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Rita.</v>

44
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.470
<v Speaker 1>You're still here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I came back.</v>

45
00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:28.723
<v Speaker 1>I thought that's what you wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody wants you here in this first </v>

46
00:02:31.011 --> 00:02:33.290
<v Speaker 1>reading.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The scene is revealed to be trite,</v>

47
00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.153
<v Speaker 1>the dialogue cliched and melodramatic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's character rebukes her father's </v>

48
00:02:37.581 --> 00:02:40.820
<v Speaker 1>friend who is trying to seduce her for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the second time it seems,</v>

49
00:02:40.821 --> 00:02:44.330
<v Speaker 1>and she moves closer and closer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As for threats become more stern,</v>

50
00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.480
<v Speaker 1>the two women can't even finish without </v>
<v Speaker 1>laughing at the soap opera,</v>

51
00:02:47.481 --> 00:02:48.710
<v Speaker 1>quality of the script,</v>

52
00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:51.120
<v Speaker 2>crowded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crying,</v>

53
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.630
<v Speaker 2>cry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I say with big emotion,</v>

54
00:02:54.631 --> 00:02:57.000
<v Speaker 2>I drove.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate us both.</v>

55
00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.400
<v Speaker 1>So a universe of expectation has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>laid out for the viewer.</v>

56
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.670
<v Speaker 1>Will see in a second how those </v>
<v Speaker 1>expectations will work as a trap.</v>

57
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.220
<v Speaker 1>But at the start,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything in the audition room seems to</v>

58
00:03:06.221 --> 00:03:07.054
<v Speaker 1>reinforce what we already think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people are about as stiff as the </v>

59
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.170
<v Speaker 1>wood paneling that he's reading,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partner what he looks like a star of all</v>

60
00:03:14.171 --> 00:03:16.630
<v Speaker 1>my children who spent a little too much </v>
<v Speaker 1>time in the sun.</v>

61
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.450
<v Speaker 1>The director is absent minded and </v>
<v Speaker 1>laughable.</v>

62
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.720
<v Speaker 1>So when the scene begins and woody </v>
<v Speaker 1>corrals betty into his slimy grasp,</v>

63
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.410
<v Speaker 1>what triggers first is our awareness of </v>
<v Speaker 1>how vulnerable she is,</v>

64
00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:30.413
<v Speaker 1>and then when she pushes him away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't know if she's reacting as </v>

65
00:03:33.071 --> 00:03:38.071
<v Speaker 1>herself or as the character than woody </v>
<v Speaker 1>moves to put his hands below her waist,</v>

66
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:40.263
<v Speaker 1>and something incredible happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A transformation so sudden that the </v>

67
00:03:43.901 --> 00:03:44.734
<v Speaker 1>viewer experiences whiplash as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>critic George tolls notes were lured </v>

68
00:03:48.521 --> 00:03:50.740
<v Speaker 1>into engaging emotionally with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>scene.</v>

69
00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:54.880
<v Speaker 1>When lynch triggers our expectation that</v>
<v Speaker 1>betty might be exploited.</v>

70
00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.360
<v Speaker 1>We've dropped our guard a little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's already too much.</v>

71
00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.390
<v Speaker 1>We've surrendered enough so that when </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lynch switches the bait,</v>

72
00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.400
<v Speaker 1>we're left in awe at what happens next.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

73
00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.590
<v Speaker 3>It's not that difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He trusts you</v>

74
00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.240
<v Speaker 1>all throughout the film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From the overdub dialogue on down,</v>

75
00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.600
<v Speaker 1>David Lynch has made us privy to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>veneer of things.</v>

76
00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.770
<v Speaker 1>It's all curiously two dimensional and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that puts us on our card.</v>

77
00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.903
<v Speaker 1>Since surfaces are what we get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lynch encourages us to examine those </v>

78
00:04:42.061 --> 00:04:42.894
<v Speaker 1>surfaces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>always remaining detached enough for a </v>

79
00:04:44.731 --> 00:04:47.370
<v Speaker 1>disinterested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>critical view of what we're seeing,</v>

80
00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.640
<v Speaker 1>but as with everything that Lynch does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this two dimensionality,</v>

81
00:04:50.641 --> 00:04:51.474
<v Speaker 1>this flatness is also a deception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you said you would entertain </v>

82
00:04:55.231 --> 00:04:59.040
<v Speaker 1>suggestions and that's all anybody here </v>
<v Speaker 1>is asking you to do.</v>

83
00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.720
<v Speaker 1>What are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>While we think we're on our guard,</v>

84
00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.200
<v Speaker 1>superior to the clawing emotions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood wish fulfillment,</v>

85
00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:08.363
<v Speaker 1>Lynch relishes dropping the bottom out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>showing us just how unprepared and </v>

86
00:05:12.961 --> 00:05:16.500
<v Speaker 1>susceptible we are to emotions that our </v>
<v Speaker 1>society,</v>

87
00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.680
<v Speaker 1>treasurers or deeply fierce in a scene </v>
<v Speaker 1>that mirrors the audition.</v>

88
00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.450
<v Speaker 1>Betty and Rita go to a place called </v>
<v Speaker 1>club.</v>

89
00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.300
<v Speaker 1>Silencio were a special show is </v>
<v Speaker 1>underway.</v>

90
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.430
<v Speaker 1>The host repeats again and again.</v>

91
00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:32.163
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

92
00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.990
<v Speaker 1>and everything you're hearing he says is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a tape recording.</v>

93
00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.680
<v Speaker 1>Expectations for the scene are made </v>
<v Speaker 1>totally explicit.</v>

94
00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:48.170
<v Speaker 1>Then a woman comes out and sings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a truly heartbreaking Spanish version of</v>

95
00:05:48.171 --> 00:05:53.150
<v Speaker 1>Roy orbison's crying lynch pushes tight </v>
<v Speaker 1>into her face in an extreme closeup,</v>

96
00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:56.060
<v Speaker 1>and the film begins to taunt us.</v>

97
00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:01.260
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

98
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.660
<v Speaker 1>what's at stake here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>As in any movie is belief.</v>

99
00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:17.650
<v Speaker 1>Can the director of make you believe the</v>
<v Speaker 1>artifice being presented to you?</v>

100
00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:19.083
<v Speaker 1>It's why directors use expectations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We incorporated from other films when </v>

101
00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.470
<v Speaker 1>two people lock eyes for the first time </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the camera pushes in.</v>

102
00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:30.130
<v Speaker 1>That's love at first sight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is one way to generate belief.</v>

103
00:06:30.131 --> 00:06:30.964
<v Speaker 1>The definition of expectation is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>strong belief that something will </v>

104
00:06:34.721 --> 00:06:38.110
<v Speaker 1>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but lynch goes a step further.</v>

105
00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.950
<v Speaker 1>In one way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he sets up an expectation than lures you</v>

106
00:06:41.951 --> 00:06:45.250
<v Speaker 1>into believing the opposite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when the rug is pulled out,</v>

107
00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:47.530
<v Speaker 1>the audience is left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suspended,</v>

108
00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.060
<v Speaker 1>caught out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and captured,</v>

109
00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:49.923
<v Speaker 1>engaging fully with the terrifying </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothingness that they were warned </v>

110
00:06:53.651 --> 00:06:56.170
<v Speaker 1>against.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the film finally takes it's hard,</v>

111
00:06:56.171 --> 00:06:57.004
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Turn revealing Betty's true story of </v>

112
00:06:58.330 --> 00:06:59.163
<v Speaker 1>pain and degradation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're confronted again with the same </v>

113
00:07:01.691 --> 00:07:02.524
<v Speaker 1>feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>believing we're going to get the key to </v>

114
00:07:03.851 --> 00:07:04.684
<v Speaker 1>the mystery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but instead are only sunk deeper into </v>

115
00:07:07.481 --> 00:07:08.314
<v Speaker 1>the dream and it's worth noting by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way that this all comes from an </v>

116
00:07:10.631 --> 00:07:15.631
<v Speaker 1>expectation that goes unfulfilled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the audition scene plays the reverse</v>

117
00:07:16.121 --> 00:07:17.530
<v Speaker 1>feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think this is important.</v>

118
00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.830
<v Speaker 1>Instead of pulling the rug out to reveal</v>
<v Speaker 1>an abyss,</v>

119
00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.113
<v Speaker 1>we come in fully prepared and analytical</v>
<v Speaker 1>only to be dropped into a space of raw </v>

120
00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:29.740
<v Speaker 1>and honest emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though we know it's active,</v>

121
00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:30.593
<v Speaker 1>even though we know this is a film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were entranced totally believing the </v>

122
00:07:34.631 --> 00:07:35.464
<v Speaker 1>moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not because our expectations were </v>

123
00:07:36.611 --> 00:07:40.030
<v Speaker 1>fulfilled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because they were subverted in a way</v>

124
00:07:40.031 --> 00:07:45.031
<v Speaker 1>that we didn't think was possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now I say with big emotion,</v>

125
00:07:45.821 --> 00:07:46.750
<v Speaker 1>I drove</v>

126
00:07:57.870 --> 00:07:58.703
<v Speaker 1>not content with the dreams that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood has been feeding us and mass </v>

127
00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:03.023
<v Speaker 1>for decades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>David Lynch uses cliched expectation to </v>

128
00:08:07.471 --> 00:08:08.304
<v Speaker 1>move us into the spaces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Film has yet to go showing us the </v>

129
00:08:11.551 --> 00:08:14.740
<v Speaker 1>dangers and the hopes of believable.</v>

130
00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:18.800
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe it.</v>

131
00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:29.220
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot of lynch in a week period.</v>
