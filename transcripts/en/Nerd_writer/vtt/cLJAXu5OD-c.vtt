1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.530
<v Speaker 1>Christoph,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me ask you,</v>

2
00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.870
<v Speaker 1>why do you think that the Truman has </v>
<v Speaker 1>never come close to discovering the true</v>

3
00:00:06.871 --> 00:00:08.610
<v Speaker 1>nature of his world?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Until now,</v>

4
00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:12.280
<v Speaker 2>we accept the reality of the world with </v>
<v Speaker 2>which group presented.</v>

5
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.940
<v Speaker 2>It's as simple as that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the beginning of the Truman show,</v>

6
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.640
<v Speaker 2>a star falls from the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

7
00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:19.683
<v Speaker 2>a light falls from the ceiling of a sky </v>
<v Speaker 2>high set that encloses an artificial </v>

8
00:00:23.651 --> 00:00:28.651
<v Speaker 2>town built for the life of one man and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the entertainment of the whole world.</v>

9
00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.750
<v Speaker 2>The light says serious nine Kennis </v>
<v Speaker 2>major,</v>

10
00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.830
<v Speaker 2>which refers to serious the brightest </v>
<v Speaker 2>star in the night sky.</v>

11
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.933
<v Speaker 2>This star,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which homer one's called an evil </v>

12
00:00:38.561 --> 00:00:39.394
<v Speaker 2>portent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bringing heat and fevers to suffering </v>

13
00:00:41.231 --> 00:00:42.064
<v Speaker 2>humanity in the film.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The falling of Sirius is the first in a </v>

14
00:00:44.921 --> 00:00:48.070
<v Speaker 2>series of ruptures in Truman's fake </v>
<v Speaker 2>reality.</v>

15
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.103
<v Speaker 2>A series that ends here with an actual </v>
<v Speaker 2>rupture of breaching things as they are </v>

16
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.360
<v Speaker 2>like in homework,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Peter,</v>

17
00:00:55.361 --> 00:01:00.130
<v Speaker 2>we are director of the Truman show </v>
<v Speaker 2>envisions this door into real reality in</v>

18
00:01:00.131 --> 00:01:01.930
<v Speaker 2>darker terms than you might expect.</v>

19
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.913
<v Speaker 2>All the symbols we usually associate </v>
<v Speaker 2>with goodness and positivity are behind </v>

20
00:01:06.401 --> 00:01:08.020
<v Speaker 2>Truman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bright blue skies,</v>

21
00:01:08.021 --> 00:01:12.340
<v Speaker 2>Sun beams breaking through the clouds </v>
<v Speaker 2>and expansive sea of possibility,</v>

22
00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.730
<v Speaker 2>reality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>truth and authenticity on the other hand</v>

23
00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.380
<v Speaker 2>are relegated to a small single </v>
<v Speaker 2>rectangle of shadow,</v>

24
00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:21.693
<v Speaker 2>hardly the light at the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>tunnel that we normally associate with </v>

25
00:01:24.761 --> 00:01:26.620
<v Speaker 2>liberation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All throughout the film.</v>

26
00:01:26.621 --> 00:01:29.920
<v Speaker 2>Freedom for Truman is linked tightly </v>
<v Speaker 2>with trauma.</v>

27
00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.970
<v Speaker 2>Every peak behind the curtain is </v>
<v Speaker 2>accompanied by some form of pain,</v>

28
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.270
<v Speaker 2>whether it's the pain of seeing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>image of a deceased loved one,</v>

29
00:01:37.271 --> 00:01:39.910
<v Speaker 2>the pain of a true connection abruptly </v>
<v Speaker 2>cut short,</v>

30
00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.780
<v Speaker 2>the pain of memory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or simply the pain of uncertainty of not</v>

31
00:01:43.781 --> 00:01:47.650
<v Speaker 2>knowing what it is you're seeing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's of course the pain that we're all</v>

32
00:01:47.651 --> 00:01:49.900
<v Speaker 2>familiar with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's why for the most part,</v>

33
00:01:49.901 --> 00:01:54.730
<v Speaker 2>we see only what we want to see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Truman has been privy to a lifetime full</v>

34
00:01:54.731 --> 00:01:55.564
<v Speaker 2>of hints,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clues to the fact that his world is not </v>

35
00:01:57.941 --> 00:01:58.774
<v Speaker 2>as it seems.</v>

36
00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.610
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we incorporate those clues</v>

37
00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:04.783
<v Speaker 2>to reconfigure the entire narrative of </v>
<v Speaker 2>his existence and rewrites like that </v>

38
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.510
<v Speaker 2>just aren't free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They cost,</v>

39
00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.460
<v Speaker 2>they cost suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Peter,</v>

40
00:02:13.461 --> 00:02:16.580
<v Speaker 2>we're in writer Andrew.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nicole were prophetic about so much from</v>

41
00:02:16.581 --> 00:02:20.150
<v Speaker 2>the vantage of 1998,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ubiquity of reality television,</v>

42
00:02:20.151 --> 00:02:20.984
<v Speaker 2>the rise of mass surveillance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They keyed in perfectly to my parents' </v>

43
00:02:24.141 --> 00:02:24.974
<v Speaker 2>generation of cold war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>paranoia of being watched or bugged and </v>

44
00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:33.320
<v Speaker 2>my own generation of narcissism where it</v>
<v Speaker 2>bugs us not to be watched,</v>

45
00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.180
<v Speaker 2>and that's a great joy of the Truman </v>
<v Speaker 2>show,</v>

46
00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:36.043
<v Speaker 2>the allegories and layered readings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The headiness of it all stands out </v>

47
00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.440
<v Speaker 2>vividly even for a kid like I was when I</v>
<v Speaker 2>saw it at age 10.</v>

48
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.393
<v Speaker 2>It's not pedantic or preachy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just asked so many damn questions </v>

49
00:02:45.921 --> 00:02:46.754
<v Speaker 2>that they're impossible to ignore the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hell you talking about who you talking </v>

50
00:02:51.801 --> 00:02:52.634
<v Speaker 2>to and actually I was watching it again </v>
<v Speaker 2>recently and I was really struck by how </v>

51
00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.620
<v Speaker 2>easily the Truman show can be read as an</v>
<v Speaker 2>allegory for the present.</v>

52
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.080
<v Speaker 2>Like Truman's town of sea haven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our own world seems to be experiencing a</v>

53
00:03:05.081 --> 00:03:05.914
<v Speaker 2>similar series of ruptures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rupture is like the great recession in </v>

54
00:03:09.431 --> 00:03:11.200
<v Speaker 2>2008,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Arab spring,</v>

55
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:12.333
<v Speaker 2>like the killings of young black men by </v>
<v Speaker 2>police or are increasing awareness of </v>

56
00:03:15.881 --> 00:03:16.714
<v Speaker 2>them like Brexit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the splitting of the UK from Europe and </v>

57
00:03:19.571 --> 00:03:20.404
<v Speaker 2>most recently like the rise of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>political outsider movements of Bernie </v>

58
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:24.753
<v Speaker 2>Sanders and Donald Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think American society at large is a </v>

59
00:03:27.521 --> 00:03:28.354
<v Speaker 2>lot like truman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>burbank laboring like him for 30 plus </v>

60
00:03:31.061 --> 00:03:35.590
<v Speaker 2>years under a system that is finally </v>
<v Speaker 2>showing itself to be ridiculous.</v>

61
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.720
<v Speaker 2>Society like Truman is trying to wake </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself up while stumbling under the pain</v>

62
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:41.643
<v Speaker 2>that surfaces from doing so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Truman show is a massive operation </v>

63
00:03:45.161 --> 00:03:45.994
<v Speaker 2>with a crew and cast of thousands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for all the power that Christophe </v>

64
00:03:49.121 --> 00:03:49.954
<v Speaker 2>commands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the show's success always hinges on </v>

65
00:03:53.261 --> 00:03:57.100
<v Speaker 2>Truman himself and can only work if </v>
<v Speaker 2>truman believes in it.</v>

66
00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.233
<v Speaker 2>He couldn't leave at anytime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you are absolutely determined to </v>

67
00:04:01.961 --> 00:04:02.794
<v Speaker 2>discover the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no way we could prevent the </v>

68
00:04:06.401 --> 00:04:07.234
<v Speaker 2>powerful in our world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hold things in place like Christophe </v>

69
00:04:09.431 --> 00:04:13.780
<v Speaker 2>holds true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we hold ourselves in place to,</v>

70
00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.943
<v Speaker 2>if nothing else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's clear that in 2016 we are slowly </v>

71
00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.690
<v Speaker 2>waking up into a new political reality </v>
<v Speaker 2>like in Truman's world,</v>

72
00:04:22.691 --> 00:04:23.524
<v Speaker 2>the power relationships of our own have </v>
<v Speaker 2>gained in consolidated strength by </v>

73
00:04:27.041 --> 00:04:30.460
<v Speaker 2>convincing us that they're normal like </v>
<v Speaker 2>laws of nature,</v>

74
00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:33.880
<v Speaker 2>by taking any breach and folding it back</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the narrative.</v>

75
00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.170
<v Speaker 2>They've kept all those like Truman who </v>
<v Speaker 2>are perennial losers at bay,</v>

76
00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:39.643
<v Speaker 2>but ideologies don't last forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eventually they crumble under their own </v>

77
00:04:43.301 --> 00:04:46.960
<v Speaker 2>weight and the increasing refusal of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people to believe in.</v>

78
00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.030
<v Speaker 2>Thank you for your help.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're welcome chairman.</v>

79
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:55.180
<v Speaker 2>The Truman show shows us what waking up </v>
<v Speaker 2>looks like.</v>

80
00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.660
<v Speaker 2>It stages in a really valuable way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The struggles that come with it.</v>

81
00:04:58.661 --> 00:05:03.100
<v Speaker 2>It shows how the messaging of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dominant ideology is absorbed into media</v>

82
00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.010
<v Speaker 2>and into education.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It shows us how individual people,</v>

83
00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.873
<v Speaker 2>even people we trust,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good people can become the mouthpieces </v>

84
00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:12.370
<v Speaker 2>of a rotten system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody is in on it.</v>

85
00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.120
<v Speaker 2>I'd have to be in a two and most </v>
<v Speaker 2>importantly evolve.</v>

86
00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.690
<v Speaker 2>The Truman show imagines liberation not </v>
<v Speaker 2>as utopia,</v>

87
00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.943
<v Speaker 2>but as a world flawed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like our own full of multiplicity and </v>

88
00:05:26.411 --> 00:05:29.890
<v Speaker 2>contradiction and people obsessed with </v>
<v Speaker 2>TV.</v>

89
00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.830
<v Speaker 2>It's a world gained only by struggle and</v>
<v Speaker 2>paint,</v>

90
00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.500
<v Speaker 2>one that often looks like an evil </v>
<v Speaker 2>portend in the moment.</v>

91
00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:38.830
<v Speaker 2>It's not a sunburst and the clouds or an</v>
<v Speaker 2>endless seat,</v>

92
00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:40.263
<v Speaker 2>but a small shadowy door that leads off </v>
<v Speaker 2>to a territory unmapped but invested </v>

93
00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.700
<v Speaker 2>hopefully with a greater authenticity in</v>
<v Speaker 2>case I don't say.</v>

94
00:05:49.701 --> 00:05:52.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good afternoon.</v>

95
00:05:52.511 --> 00:05:53.344
<v Speaker 2>Good evening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is a new nerve writer video every </v>

96

<v Speaker 2>And that's what helps me out the most.</v>

99
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:17.000
<v Speaker 2>The Truman show blows my mind every time</v>
<v Speaker 2>I watch it.</v>

100
00:06:17.001 --> 00:06:20.210
<v Speaker 2>I saw it in the theaters when I was 10 </v>
<v Speaker 2>in 1998 with my mom,</v>

101
00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.700
<v Speaker 2>and it was one of the best movie </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences,</v>

102
00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:24.770
<v Speaker 2>the formative movie experiences of my </v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

103
00:06:24.771 --> 00:06:26.690
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this was a blast to make.</v>

104
00:06:26.691 --> 00:06:27.740
<v Speaker 2>Thanks so much for watching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again.</v>

105
00:06:27.741 --> 00:06:29.240
<v Speaker 2>I'll see you guys next Wednesday.</v>
