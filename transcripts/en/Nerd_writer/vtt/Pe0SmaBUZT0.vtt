00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.580
<v Speaker 1>With other social media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure,</v>

2
00:00:02.581 --> 00:00:07.260
<v Speaker 1>but I have no doubt that read it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>improving my life.</v>

3
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.660
<v Speaker 1>Reddit is hive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind meets extreme democracy.</v>

4
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.410
<v Speaker 1>It has the personality of a single human</v>
<v Speaker 1>being,</v>

5
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.303
<v Speaker 1>but it also reflects the personalities </v>
<v Speaker 1>of millions of people all around the </v>

6
00:00:24.031 --> 00:00:24.864
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The uniformity of sensibility which can </v>

7
00:00:26.731 --> 00:00:27.564
<v Speaker 1>be seen on the front page where the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>popular links are found becomes much </v>

8
00:00:31.771 --> 00:00:34.530
<v Speaker 1>more amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I see that in the last month,</v>

9
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.600
<v Speaker 1>reddit had $90,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million,</v>

10
00:00:36.601 --> 00:00:41.601
<v Speaker 1>946,972</v>
<v Speaker 1>unique visitor as hank green might say.</v>

11
00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to get my mind around </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

12
00:00:45.121 --> 00:00:47.970
<v Speaker 1>Speaking of Hank Green and the vlog </v>
<v Speaker 1>brothers Nerdfighteria,</v>

13
00:00:47.971 --> 00:00:48.804
<v Speaker 1>their online community is a smaller but </v>
<v Speaker 1>analogous example to the reddit </v>

14
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.633
<v Speaker 1>universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nerdfighteria has its own events like </v>

15
00:00:55.411 --> 00:00:56.244
<v Speaker 1>the project for awesome and its own </v>
<v Speaker 1>eccentricities like pizza John or </v>

16
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.893
<v Speaker 1>sharpie face or peanut butter face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the same way reddit has its own </v>

17
00:01:03.841 --> 00:01:06.900
<v Speaker 1>personality traits like its obsession </v>
<v Speaker 1>with memes.</v>

18
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.320
<v Speaker 1>Video Games,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the asked me anything feature or explain</v>

19
00:01:10.321 --> 00:01:12.780
<v Speaker 1>like I'm five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has its own politics right now.</v>

20
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:13.733
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really invested in the NSA scandal </v>

21
00:01:15.421 --> 00:01:18.060
<v Speaker 1>and issues concerning Internet </v>
<v Speaker 1>censorship.</v>

22
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.460
<v Speaker 1>There are things it hates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like improper reddick.</v>

23
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:22.343
<v Speaker 1>One thing I discovered this week is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>reddit dislikes the creation of new </v>

24
00:01:26.101 --> 00:01:26.934
<v Speaker 1>means for my friend's 30th birthday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All his friends came together to make </v>

25
00:01:30.031 --> 00:01:32.440
<v Speaker 1>him into a popular meme.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

26
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:33.383
<v Speaker 1>it's called the sad elias meme and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can find the link for it in the </v>

27
00:01:35.641 --> 00:01:38.160
<v Speaker 1>description and submit anything to it </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you want.</v>

28
00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.060
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I tried to post our examples to</v>

29
00:01:42.061 --> 00:01:42.894
<v Speaker 1>read it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found out that making memes of </v>

30
00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:48.840
<v Speaker 1>pictures that you've taken is a ban </v>
<v Speaker 1>double offense.</v>

31
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.840
<v Speaker 1>A banana bowl events in its countless </v>
<v Speaker 1>subreddits,</v>

32
00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:53.693
<v Speaker 1>communities are more specific and </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultish and like the dark side of </v>

33
00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.223
<v Speaker 1>Tumblr,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reddit has its fair share of porn and </v>

34
00:02:00.391 --> 00:02:01.290
<v Speaker 1>nasty shit.</v>

35
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.230
<v Speaker 1>Here's a perfect example of what I love </v>
<v Speaker 1>about reading.</v>

36
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.380
<v Speaker 1>This is a screenshot I took of an Ama </v>
<v Speaker 1>with Lord.</v>

37
00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.700
<v Speaker 1>It starts with Lord answering a question</v>
<v Speaker 1>about her seeming fixation with teeth in</v>

38
00:02:11.701 --> 00:02:13.800
<v Speaker 1>her lyrics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she admits the obsession,</v>

39
00:02:13.801 --> 00:02:14.634
<v Speaker 1>but says that she hates dentists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the first response is a Seinfeld </v>

40
00:02:18.931 --> 00:02:20.520
<v Speaker 1>reference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just a dentist.</v>

41
00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:21.693
<v Speaker 1>And your an anti identity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the second response is a comedic </v>

42
00:02:26.341 --> 00:02:28.230
<v Speaker 1>use of the transitive property of </v>
<v Speaker 1>equality.</v>

43
00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:29.243
<v Speaker 1>Then we have a run of dentists and teeth</v>
<v Speaker 1>related puns in which Lord rejoins the </v>

44
00:02:33.901 --> 00:02:34.734
<v Speaker 1>conversation with a pun of her own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then someone makes a teeth and Lord </v>

45
00:02:38.221 --> 00:02:41.160
<v Speaker 1>Related Pun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then someone finds an image of what that</v>

46
00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:41.994
<v Speaker 1>pun describes and then the next person </v>
<v Speaker 1>shares the link to that artists other </v>

47
00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:46.591
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember,</v>

48
00:02:46.591 --> 00:02:49.590
<v Speaker 1>the comments aren't chronological.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're based on upvotes,</v>

49
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:50.543
<v Speaker 1>which means that the order they appear </v>
<v Speaker 1>in represents what redditors care about </v>

50
00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.890
<v Speaker 1>the most.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this case,</v>

51
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.500
<v Speaker 1>clever references,</v>
<v Speaker 1>puns,</v>

52
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.780
<v Speaker 1>Fan art,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and proper attribution.</v>

53
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:01.623
<v Speaker 1>My favorite thing about reddit is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost 100 percent content based </v>

54
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.540
<v Speaker 1>though millions of people contribute to </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

55
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:08.403
<v Speaker 1>They do so anonymously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not mixed up with the pathetic </v>

56
00:03:12.041 --> 00:03:12.874
<v Speaker 1>local fame obsessions of facebook and </v>
<v Speaker 1>instagram or the much larger fame </v>

57
00:03:16.931 --> 00:03:17.764
<v Speaker 1>obsessions of Youtube personalities like</v>
<v Speaker 1>myself in the social media war between </v>

58
00:03:22.811 --> 00:03:27.550
<v Speaker 1>platforms that represent social and </v>
<v Speaker 1>platforms that represent media.</v>

59
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.830
<v Speaker 1>Reddit is the purest representation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the nobler side.</v>

60
00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.313
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

61
00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:39.543
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you probably want to know why I </v>

62
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.630
<v Speaker 1>haven't posted a video and I don't even </v>
<v Speaker 1>know how many months,</v>

63
00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.390
<v Speaker 1>lot of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Laziness,</v>

64
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.570
<v Speaker 1>disgusted with the form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Still a little bit disgusted with it.</v>

65
00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm 60 vlogs straight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just was burnt out.</v>

66
00:03:53.741 --> 00:03:54.574
<v Speaker 1>I had nothing more to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but mostly I just wanted to try other </v>

67
00:03:56.561 --> 00:03:57.394
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things I did try was </v>

68
00:03:58.481 --> 00:04:01.680
<v Speaker 1>making music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just released an APP,</v>

69
00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>under my dj producer name,</v>

70
00:04:05.771 --> 00:04:08.680
<v Speaker 1>which is strum stick called new </v>
<v Speaker 1>disguises.</v>

71
00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:11.440
<v Speaker 1>You can find it on spotify,</v>
<v Speaker 1>soundcloud,</v>

72
00:04:11.441 --> 00:04:12.520
<v Speaker 1>itunes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wherever.</v>

73
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:13.533
<v Speaker 1>Go listen to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spent a lot of time and effort on it </v>

74
00:04:16.571 --> 00:04:17.440
<v Speaker 1>and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm proud of it.</v>

75
00:04:17.441 --> 00:04:19.570
<v Speaker 1>And it's something that I want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>explore much,</v>

76
00:04:19.571 --> 00:04:20.404
<v Speaker 1>much further.</v>
