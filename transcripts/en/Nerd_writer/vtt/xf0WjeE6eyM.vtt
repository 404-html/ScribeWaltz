1
00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:03.850
<v Speaker 1>Unlike in live action,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cinematography,</v>

2
00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:07.510
<v Speaker 1>lighting in animation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something that's built totally from</v>

3
00:00:07.511 --> 00:00:09.310
<v Speaker 1>scratch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

4
00:00:09.311 --> 00:00:10.144
<v Speaker 1>well in live action,</v>
<v Speaker 1>light is controlled sometimes too </v>

5
00:00:12.641 --> 00:00:16.780
<v Speaker 1>brilliant effect in animation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Light is created.</v>

6
00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.170
<v Speaker 1>Of course these days a lot of animated </v>
<v Speaker 1>light is computer generated,</v>

7
00:00:20.171 --> 00:00:21.004
<v Speaker 1>meaning that virtual lights can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>placed in three d environments and </v>

8
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.950
<v Speaker 1>actually play off solid surfaces like </v>
<v Speaker 1>they would in real life,</v>

9
00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:28.323
<v Speaker 1>like the control of actual lights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This too can be used to beautiful </v>

10
00:00:30.761 --> 00:00:31.594
<v Speaker 1>effect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but today I want to talk about lighting </v>

11
00:00:33.461 --> 00:00:36.610
<v Speaker 1>as it was done in traditional hand drawn</v>
<v Speaker 1>cell animation,</v>

12
00:00:36.611 --> 00:00:40.490
<v Speaker 1>particularly in the groundbreaking anime</v>
<v Speaker 1>film by Ketso Hero Tomo,</v>

13
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:41.673
<v Speaker 1>Akira.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now Kira is well known for it's </v>

14
00:00:43.421 --> 00:00:44.254
<v Speaker 1>painstaking animation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every frame of the film was composed </v>

15
00:00:47.261 --> 00:00:48.094
<v Speaker 1>with the closest attention to detail and</v>
<v Speaker 1>color and that gives it an unmatched </v>

16
00:00:52.061 --> 00:00:54.170
<v Speaker 1>richness and soul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For this reason,</v>

17
00:00:54.171 --> 00:00:55.004
<v Speaker 1>the cure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is also a film that's been </v>

18
00:00:55.691 --> 00:00:58.660
<v Speaker 1>painstakingly picked over and analyze by</v>
<v Speaker 1>others,</v>

19
00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.853
<v Speaker 1>but one thing I haven't heard much about</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the way that lighting is used by the </v>

20
00:01:03.191 --> 00:01:05.290
<v Speaker 1>filmmakers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I see the films,</v>

21
00:01:05.291 --> 00:01:06.124
<v Speaker 1>many lights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are different qualities and </v>

22
00:01:07.331 --> 00:01:12.331
<v Speaker 1>textures as a powerful motif and symbol </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a vital element of it's genius</v>

23
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.730
<v Speaker 2>backgrounds must still be photographed </v>
<v Speaker 2>by the master camera in technicolor.</v>

24
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They operate with the Donald Duck on top</v>

25
00:01:23.031 --> 00:01:25.820
<v Speaker 2>of a background as the overhead camera </v>
<v Speaker 2>exposures.</v>

26
00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:26.960
<v Speaker 2>One frame of film,</v>

27
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.033
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Akira was a film made in the cell </v>

28
00:01:29.631 --> 00:01:32.630
<v Speaker 1>animation style developed in the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>half of the 20th century,</v>

29
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:33.643
<v Speaker 1>which involves drawing and painting on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>transparent slides and layering them </v>

30
00:01:36.501 --> 00:01:37.334
<v Speaker 1>over a background frames composed like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this were photographed and strung </v>

31
00:01:40.341 --> 00:01:41.174
<v Speaker 1>together to create the animation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This Two d traditional style coupled </v>

32
00:01:44.421 --> 00:01:45.254
<v Speaker 1>with the tropes of anime means that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>light and Akira is specific and </v>

33
00:01:49.521 --> 00:01:51.800
<v Speaker 1>pronounce the lines between shadow and </v>
<v Speaker 1>light,</v>

34
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.903
<v Speaker 1>are distinct and evocative in the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>way that film noir lighting is and like </v>

35
00:01:57.031 --> 00:01:57.864
<v Speaker 1>in film noir light and Akira is </v>
<v Speaker 1>intimately connected to the city at </v>

36
00:02:02.271 --> 00:02:03.860
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This for example,</v>

37
00:02:03.861 --> 00:02:04.694
<v Speaker 1>is the very first shot after the opening</v>
<v Speaker 1>credits of flickering neon sign for the </v>

38
00:02:07.881 --> 00:02:08.714
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood bar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where can neda is waiting for his </v>

39
00:02:10.221 --> 00:02:12.680
<v Speaker 1>friends?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing could more concisely communicate</v>

40
00:02:12.681 --> 00:02:15.530
<v Speaker 1>the rundown dystopic feeling of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>

41
00:02:15.531 --> 00:02:20.030
<v Speaker 1>Tokyo Tomo is going to present us with </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the very next shot and throughout the</v>

42
00:02:20.031 --> 00:02:20.864
<v Speaker 1>film.</v>

43
00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:21.703
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a city as sorted romantic and </v>

44
00:02:23.841 --> 00:02:24.674
<v Speaker 1>multifarious as the lights that slash </v>
<v Speaker 1>across it's million surfaces to make a </v>

45
00:02:28.881 --> 00:02:31.940
<v Speaker 1>delicate whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the city where the disenfranchised young</v>

46
00:02:31.941 --> 00:02:32.774
<v Speaker 1>mark their presence and their </v>
<v Speaker 1>personalities with the streaks of light </v>

47
00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:36.763
<v Speaker 1>that their motorcycles leave behind the </v>
<v Speaker 1>city where authority is as much a </v>

48
00:02:40.191 --> 00:02:43.850
<v Speaker 1>blinding spotlight as it is a gun or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>badge.</v>

49
00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:44.703
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tomo has said that he wanted Tokyo </v>

50
00:02:45.801 --> 00:02:46.634
<v Speaker 1>itself to be a major character and Akira</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the ways he flushes this out </v>

51
00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.893
<v Speaker 1>is with light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly neon neon has a special </v>

52
00:02:53.751 --> 00:02:57.020
<v Speaker 1>significance for both Tokyo and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cyberpunk genre.</v>

53
00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:02.320
<v Speaker 1>It is the bitter but beautiful that </v>
<v Speaker 1>signifies both the colorful radiance and</v>

54
00:03:02.411 --> 00:03:07.411
<v Speaker 1>the Gadi consumerism of modernity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That dark dystopian side of which remain</v>

55
00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.330
<v Speaker 1>cyberpunks basic focus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tokyo for its part,</v>

56
00:03:10.331 --> 00:03:15.010
<v Speaker 1>has been a cultural hub for neon signage</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever since 1957.</v>

57
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.873
<v Speaker 1>When the Sukkot company unveiled its </v>
<v Speaker 1>giant 30 foot neon billboard in the </v>

58
00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:22.660
<v Speaker 1>Ginza district revealing its new name.</v>

59
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:24.610
<v Speaker 1>Sony.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since then,</v>

60
00:03:24.611 --> 00:03:27.040
<v Speaker 1>the science have proliferated becoming a</v>
<v Speaker 1>signature,</v>

61
00:03:27.041 --> 00:03:27.874
<v Speaker 1>even a tourist attraction of Tokyo's </v>
<v Speaker 1>nightscape and novels like William </v>

62
00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:32.793
<v Speaker 1>Gibson's neuromancer films like blade </v>
<v Speaker 1>runner took the vivid and suggestive </v>

63
00:03:35.951 --> 00:03:40.080
<v Speaker 1>qualities of Tokyo's neon as their </v>
<v Speaker 1>palate for oblique tech.</v>

64
00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.300
<v Speaker 1>Saturated future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Akira continues this tradition,</v>

65
00:03:43.301 --> 00:03:44.134
<v Speaker 1>but here are the neon quality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>infuses all the light sources of the </v>

66
00:03:47.051 --> 00:03:48.700
<v Speaker 1>film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both inside and out.</v>

67
00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.840
<v Speaker 1>There's the neon on the buildings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's also the neon bright screens</v>

68
00:03:52.841 --> 00:03:53.674
<v Speaker 1>that shine and the characters faces and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the neon control panels of bright </v>

69
00:03:56.741 --> 00:03:57.574
<v Speaker 1>primary colors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The spotlights that rove in the sky are </v>

70
00:04:00.131 --> 00:04:03.040
<v Speaker 1>like giant neon tubes being waved back </v>
<v Speaker 1>and forth.</v>

71
00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.250
<v Speaker 1>Machine gun fire is a barrage of neon </v>
<v Speaker 1>streaks.</v>

72
00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.740
<v Speaker 1>Even the sunlight shining through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>windows has a bluish neon quality to it.</v>

73
00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.130
<v Speaker 1>In neon neo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tokyo and its inhabitants aren't so much</v>

74
00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:15.083
<v Speaker 1>lit as caught caught in this huge </v>
<v Speaker 1>incandescent web that serves only the </v>

75
00:04:20.251 --> 00:04:21.084
<v Speaker 1>mandates of money capital in that web </v>
<v Speaker 1>government is as impotent as a biker </v>

76
00:04:26.491 --> 00:04:28.410
<v Speaker 1>gang made up of disaffected children.</v>

77
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.873
<v Speaker 1>It's funny that industry business is </v>
<v Speaker 1>notably absent from the films plot </v>

78
00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.830
<v Speaker 1>because it's DNA seems to be in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>corners of everything.</v>

79
00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.073
<v Speaker 1>We blink and you might miss a newsreader</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the beginning of the movie shining </v>

80
00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:41.403
<v Speaker 1>from another flickering lights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>source reporting riots of unemployed </v>

81
00:04:44.561 --> 00:04:49.090
<v Speaker 1>workers after tax reforms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe this is why tetsuo at once,</v>

82
00:04:49.091 --> 00:04:51.610
<v Speaker 1>the protagonist and the antagonist of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the film,</v>

83
00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:52.633
<v Speaker 1>a boy who gains extremely Mary psychic </v>
<v Speaker 1>power so often produces a disruption in </v>

84
00:04:57.381 --> 00:04:58.214
<v Speaker 1>the light around him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's in his own mind or in the </v>

85
00:05:02.031 --> 00:05:05.870
<v Speaker 1>form of explosion or in the aura around </v>
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>

86
00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.853
<v Speaker 1>even in the vibrant dancing waveland </v>
<v Speaker 1>that his brain patterns create indeed </v>

87
00:05:11.241 --> 00:05:15.320
<v Speaker 1>psychic power most fully realized in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tetsuo and his counterpoint,</v>

88
00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:16.363
<v Speaker 1>Akira represent the only kind of power </v>
<v Speaker 1>that can have an effect on the state of </v>

89
00:05:20.301 --> 00:05:21.620
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Neo Tokyo.</v>

90
00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.873
<v Speaker 1>This is perhaps the reason that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>protesters turned to Akira for their </v>

91
00:05:25.971 --> 00:05:26.804
<v Speaker 1>salvation because even when the </v>
<v Speaker 1>authorities turned their biggest </v>

92
00:05:29.331 --> 00:05:30.164
<v Speaker 1>spotlight on him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mega satellite laser that takes the </v>

93
00:05:32.751 --> 00:05:36.320
<v Speaker 1>name of our son,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he comes out the victor.</v>

94
00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:37.543
<v Speaker 1>In the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the salvation represented in Tetsuo </v>

95
00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.273
<v Speaker 1>comes at the cost of ruin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A catastrophe which consumes neo Tokyo </v>

96
00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:45.103
<v Speaker 1>in the form of a giant ball of light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one single uniform white light that </v>

97
00:05:50.271 --> 00:05:53.030
<v Speaker 1>erases the countless artificial lights </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the city.</v>

98
00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.933
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tomo seems to suggest that there's some </v>

99
00:05:55.131 --> 00:05:55.964
<v Speaker 1>freedom in this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some rebirth as true sunlight wipes </v>

100
00:05:59.001 --> 00:05:59.834
<v Speaker 1>across the city in patches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you have to draw light 24 times in </v>

101
00:06:04.911 --> 00:06:05.744
<v Speaker 1>every second of a two hour movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it must be the case that you gain a new </v>

102
00:06:09.141 --> 00:06:09.974
<v Speaker 1>appreciation for how it can tell the </v>
<v Speaker 1>story of its own and that's what our </v>

103
00:06:13.271 --> 00:06:14.104
<v Speaker 1>Tomo and his crew have done and Akira </v>
<v Speaker 1>light is layered into the story like </v>

104
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:23.180
<v Speaker 1>it's layered into the animation cells </v>
<v Speaker 1>pointing toward meaning behind the film,</v>

105
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.120
<v Speaker 1>at the corners of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and illuminating from different angles,</v>

106
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.030
<v Speaker 1>the characters and their place in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>neon world.</v>

107
00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:30.493
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Kira is a great example of how you </v>

108
00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:35.960
<v Speaker 1>animate light.</v>

109
00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:42.560
<v Speaker 3>Everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is great to be back home,</v>

110
00:06:42.561 --> 00:06:44.720

<v Speaker 3>and back on schedule.</v>
