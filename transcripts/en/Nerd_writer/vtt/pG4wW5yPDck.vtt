1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.320
<v Speaker 1>It is 57 degrees in New York City in </v>
<v Speaker 1>January,</v>

2
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:05.783
<v Speaker 1>coffee on a Tuesday and blog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>46 in the deep reaches of our universe </v>

3
00:00:21.061 --> 00:00:24.360
<v Speaker 1>and starless spaces as here in New York </v>
<v Speaker 1>City.</v>

4
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.750
<v Speaker 1>Time passes without impediment like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>ball rolling smoothly downhill forever.</v>

5
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:31.523
<v Speaker 1>We are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as humans drawn to extrapolate it </v>

6
00:00:32.911 --> 00:00:33.744
<v Speaker 1>forward and backward to the coffee we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>meant to get with a friend later this </v>

7
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.220
<v Speaker 1>afternoon to the siege of Constantinople</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 12.</v>

8
00:00:38.221 --> 00:00:38.820
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four.</v>

9
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:39.653
<v Speaker 1>To our illustrious future of flying cars</v>
<v Speaker 1>or to the time when you tried to teach </v>

10
00:00:42.421 --> 00:00:44.280
<v Speaker 1>her sister to cal when she was three</v>

11
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.430
<v Speaker 2>out loud.</v>

12
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.640
<v Speaker 1>Our meditations take us far before and </v>
<v Speaker 1>far beyond the present moment so far.</v>

13
00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.120
<v Speaker 1>We feel the gaps like giant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deep breaths in our hearts.</v>

14
00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:02.150
<v Speaker 1>But was there a time when time was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I mean to say is,</v>

15
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.180
<v Speaker 1>did time ever begin?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's start with the Wilkinson microwave</v>

16
00:01:06.181 --> 00:01:07.014
<v Speaker 1>and a Satrapi probe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Board w map a measuring device launched </v>

17
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.130
<v Speaker 1>far into the solar system in 2001 to </v>
<v Speaker 1>take spherical images of the universe at</v>

18
00:01:14.131 --> 00:01:14.964
<v Speaker 1>several different frequencies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've observed the first light emitted </v>

19
00:01:17.671 --> 00:01:20.430
<v Speaker 1>in our universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some 380,000</v>

20
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.353
<v Speaker 1>years after the big bang.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called the cosmic microwave </v>

21
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.223
<v Speaker 1>background.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Though we can't see before that we can </v>

22
00:01:26.881 --> 00:01:27.714
<v Speaker 1>extrapolate using the speed of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>expanding galaxy backwards to determine </v>

23
00:01:30.871 --> 00:01:34.680
<v Speaker 1>that the big bang happened around 13 </v>
<v Speaker 1>point 7 billion years ago.</v>

24
00:01:34.681 --> 00:01:35.580
<v Speaker 1>We can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

25
00:01:35.581 --> 00:01:36.414
<v Speaker 1>get to the moment of the Big Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can only probe with our physics two </v>

26
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.560
<v Speaker 1>right after to a second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after to a millisecond after to one unit</v>

27
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:44.603
<v Speaker 1>of plank time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly 10 to the negative 43 seconds </v>

28
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.110
<v Speaker 1>after the big bang.</v>

29
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.973
<v Speaker 1>Many of our brightest believed that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment we can't see the moment of the </v>

30
00:01:52.321 --> 00:01:53.154
<v Speaker 1>big bang is in fact a singularity and </v>
<v Speaker 1>infinitely hot and infinitely dense </v>

31
00:01:56.851 --> 00:01:58.290
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which when released,</v>

32
00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:02.070
<v Speaker 1>created space and time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Others disagree saying that our universe</v>

33
00:02:02.071 --> 00:02:02.904
<v Speaker 1>is merely one in a series or part of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>infinite loop of expansion and </v>

34
00:02:06.541 --> 00:02:07.374
<v Speaker 1>contraction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but are we any closer to conceiving of </v>

35
00:02:10.141 --> 00:02:12.800
<v Speaker 1>an answer to our question?</v>
<v Speaker 1>As the oed defines it,</v>

36
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.280
<v Speaker 1>time as the indefinite continued </v>
<v Speaker 1>progress of events in scientific terms,</v>

37
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:18.293
<v Speaker 1>it's the perpetual transition from low </v>
<v Speaker 1>entropy to high entropy from a ordered </v>

38
00:02:22.081 --> 00:02:24.420
<v Speaker 1>state to a confused one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can crack an egg,</v>

39
00:02:24.421 --> 00:02:27.990
<v Speaker 1>but you cannot uncrack it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can remember the past,</v>

40
00:02:27.991 --> 00:02:28.824
<v Speaker 1>but not the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The truth is that the only reason we </v>

41
00:02:30.661 --> 00:02:32.910
<v Speaker 1>know time is there is because we </v>
<v Speaker 1>perceive it.</v>

42
00:02:32.911 --> 00:02:33.744
<v Speaker 1>We don't see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We see simply causes and effects and </v>

43
00:02:36.151 --> 00:02:38.780
<v Speaker 1>conclude its presence as St Augustine </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

44
00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:39.990
<v Speaker 1>what then is time?</v>

45
00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.480
<v Speaker 1>If no one asks me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what it is.</v>

46
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.970
<v Speaker 1>If I wished to explain it to him who </v>
<v Speaker 1>asks,</v>

47
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.100
<v Speaker 1>I do not know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So where are we?</v>

48
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.993
<v Speaker 1>Just confused.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mouthpieces asking absurd questions </v>

49
00:02:50.431 --> 00:02:52.650
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when did time begin?</v>

50
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.170
<v Speaker 1>The question won't even allow itself to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be asked.</v>

51
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.060
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is it unreachable?</v>

52
00:02:57.061 --> 00:02:57.894
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's an answer in the </v>

53
00:02:59.291 --> 00:03:00.550
<v Speaker 1>beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Big Bang.</v>

54
00:03:00.551 --> 00:03:04.000
<v Speaker 1>The singularity is essentially a </v>
<v Speaker 1>discontinuity,</v>

55
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.700
<v Speaker 1>a break in our understanding there </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't,</v>

56
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:08.163
<v Speaker 1>and then there was the concept of </v>
<v Speaker 1>emergent phenomena is extremely </v>

57
00:03:11.501 --> 00:03:14.080
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something that arises as the effect</v>

58
00:03:14.081 --> 00:03:14.914
<v Speaker 1>of complex causes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but is not analyzable simply as the sum </v>

59
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.610
<v Speaker 1>of their effects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A great example of emergent phenomena is</v>

60
00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:22.623
<v Speaker 1>Darwinian evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The formula that is natural selection </v>

61
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.970
<v Speaker 1>can be arrived at simply by studying the</v>
<v Speaker 1>laws of physics.</v>

62
00:03:27.971 --> 00:03:31.060
<v Speaker 1>Indeed before Darwin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what every biologist tried to do.</v>

63
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.073
<v Speaker 1>It was Darwin's genius to see that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rule of evolution emerged from the rule </v>

64
00:03:35.621 --> 00:03:36.640
<v Speaker 1>of physics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to say,</v>

65
00:03:36.641 --> 00:03:38.620
<v Speaker 1>given the initial conditions of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe,</v>

66
00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:43.630
<v Speaker 1>one could not predict the emergence and </v>
<v Speaker 1>rule of Darwinian evolution on earth.</v>

67
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.650
<v Speaker 1>There is a discontinuity between the two</v>
<v Speaker 1>sets of rules in the same way.</v>

68
00:03:47.651 --> 00:03:48.484
<v Speaker 1>There's a discontinuity between matter </v>
<v Speaker 1>and light from the particles of matter </v>

69
00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:52.443
<v Speaker 1>emerge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the organizing principle of life </v>

70
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.903
<v Speaker 1>compatible with matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not analyzable as the sum of its </v>

71
00:03:57.191 --> 00:03:58.024
<v Speaker 1>effects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and here is where time comes back into </v>

72
00:04:00.461 --> 00:04:01.294
<v Speaker 1>the picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Matter by its very definition is a </v>

73
00:04:02.681 --> 00:04:05.560
<v Speaker 1>function of space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can move through time,</v>

74
00:04:05.561 --> 00:04:06.394
<v Speaker 1>but taking generally is not effected by </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the emergence of life space and </v>

75
00:04:09.521 --> 00:04:10.354
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>converged life is the evolving </v>

76
00:04:12.041 --> 00:04:12.874
<v Speaker 1>complexity of an organism in every stage</v>
<v Speaker 1>of its evolution corresponds with a </v>

77
00:04:16.991 --> 00:04:18.910
<v Speaker 1>moment in time and vice versa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

78
00:04:18.911 --> 00:04:19.744
<v Speaker 1>there's one more emergent phenomena in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this sequence and it's the most </v>

79
00:04:22.091 --> 00:04:24.490
<v Speaker 1>important to both us and our discussion </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

80
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.330
<v Speaker 1>The emergence of the mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As life came from matter,</v>

81
00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.193
<v Speaker 1>the mind came from life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the increasing complexity and </v>

82
00:04:31.901 --> 00:04:36.100
<v Speaker 1>growth of the brain coupled with of all </v>
<v Speaker 1>things the vocal cords.</v>

83
00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:36.993
<v Speaker 1>It was at the dawn of language probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometime in the last hundred thousand </v>

84
00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:45.060
<v Speaker 1>years when the dual emergence of symbols</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the mind changed everything again,</v>

85
00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.053
<v Speaker 1>the use of language to make symbols </v>
<v Speaker 1>which are just names that change in </v>

86
00:04:48.971 --> 00:04:52.330
<v Speaker 1>different context allowed for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>creation of a symbolic reality.</v>

87
00:04:52.331 --> 00:04:54.640
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything you see around you,</v>

88
00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:55.503
<v Speaker 1>the rule of symbolic reality is again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>compatible with life but not analyzable </v>

89
00:04:59.681 --> 00:05:01.900
<v Speaker 1>as the sum of its effects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something new.</v>

90
00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.883
<v Speaker 1>Our minds are something new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas matter is a function of space </v>

91
00:05:05.981 --> 00:05:08.530
<v Speaker 1>and life is a function of both space and</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

92
00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:09.573
<v Speaker 1>Our minds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the human mind is purely a function of </v>

93
00:05:12.491 --> 00:05:13.420
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about it.</v>

94
00:05:13.421 --> 00:05:14.254
<v Speaker 1>What is the one evident quality of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts that they have to happen in </v>

95
00:05:17.441 --> 00:05:18.274
<v Speaker 1>sequence?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only way we can tell one idea from </v>

96
00:05:19.541 --> 00:05:22.240
<v Speaker 1>another is by identifying the order in </v>
<v Speaker 1>which they occur.</v>

97
00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:23.103
<v Speaker 1>This is why it's hard actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>impossible for us to fully wrap our </v>

98
00:05:25.841 --> 00:05:30.160
<v Speaker 1>minds around time or to consider a state</v>
<v Speaker 1>in which it doesn't exist.</v>

99
00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:35.370
<v Speaker 1>You can't use a ruler to measure the </v>
<v Speaker 1>absence of space in a very real way.</v>

100
00:05:36.161 --> 00:05:40.060
<v Speaker 1>What we consider to be ourselves is </v>
<v Speaker 1>composed of time stuff,</v>

101
00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.090
<v Speaker 1>and it is given to us of all creatures </v>
<v Speaker 1>to consider,</v>

102
00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.350
<v Speaker 1>measure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conserve,</v>

103
00:05:44.351 --> 00:05:49.351
<v Speaker 1>and extrapolate it as we wish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are each of us time superheroes.</v>

104
00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:58.443
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
