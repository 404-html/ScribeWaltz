1
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.980
<v Speaker 1>So today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>today is the day.</v>

2
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:09.593
<v Speaker 1>It's been said before that being an </v>
<v Speaker 1>editor is a thankless job because when </v>

3
00:00:13.381 --> 00:00:16.230
<v Speaker 1>you do it right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one is supposed to notice.</v>

4
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.480
<v Speaker 1>I think this idea goes for Casey </v>
<v Speaker 1>Neistat's daily Vlog 100 percent.</v>

5
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.880
<v Speaker 1>When Neistat succeeds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all you should see is the fun.</v>

6
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.160
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are plenty of imitators.</v>

7
00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.510
<v Speaker 1>I think it's pretty much impossible to </v>
<v Speaker 1>duplicate the style of Casey Neistat.</v>

8
00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:44.703
<v Speaker 1>I think that style is worth taking a </v>
<v Speaker 1>closer look at because along with </v>

9
00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:48.453
<v Speaker 1>various other interesting sub genres </v>
<v Speaker 1>like what we're trying to do with video </v>

10
00:00:51.581 --> 00:00:53.110
<v Speaker 1>essays,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the daily Vlog,</v>

11
00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.420
<v Speaker 1>particularly what Neistat has done to </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

12
00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.040
<v Speaker 1>has grown organically and uniquely out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the medium where it lives.</v>

13
00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.650
<v Speaker 1>Online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Video shouldn't let people do that.</v>

14
00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.190
<v Speaker 1>The inner vitality of Neistat show is </v>
<v Speaker 1>undeniable.</v>

15
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.670
<v Speaker 1>That's down to his personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His worldview is insane.</v>

16
00:01:09.671 --> 00:01:12.100
<v Speaker 1>Work Ethic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even his recklessness,</v>

17
00:01:12.101 --> 00:01:16.900
<v Speaker 1>but I think the craft that supports </v>
<v Speaker 1>these things goes largely unnoticed.</v>

18
00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.153
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Neistat's revolutionary move was </v>

19
00:01:19.691 --> 00:01:20.524
<v Speaker 1>bringing more than a decade of </v>
<v Speaker 1>videographic experience to a sub genre </v>

20
00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.023
<v Speaker 1>that prizes amateur craft daily Vlogs </v>
<v Speaker 1>need a dose or a feeling of amateurism </v>

21
00:01:30.941 --> 00:01:35.941
<v Speaker 1>because what makes them valuable is how </v>
<v Speaker 1>real they seem than an age where reality</v>

22
00:01:36.191 --> 00:01:37.024
<v Speaker 1>TV was dominated by Jersey shore and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hills were scenes were prompted by the </v>

23
00:01:41.021 --> 00:01:44.230
<v Speaker 1>suggestions of producers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if not completely scripted,</v>

24
00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't care about anything else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but me and Gianni smushing.</v>

25
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.900
<v Speaker 1>Daily vlogs are the response or real </v>
<v Speaker 1>slice of life with no corporate mediator</v>

26
00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:53.793
<v Speaker 1>and the signature of something that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not corporate is a lack of Polish </v>

27
00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:58.293
<v Speaker 1>product that passes through the hands of</v>
<v Speaker 1>only one person before it was delivered </v>

28
00:02:02.141 --> 00:02:03.850
<v Speaker 1>to an audience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No audio touchups,</v>

29
00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.800
<v Speaker 1>no color correction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no notes from a distance boardroom.</v>

30
00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:07.803
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That elevated that amateur spirit to an </v>

31
00:02:10.181 --> 00:02:12.790
<v Speaker 1>art,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I say spirit because I think of what</v>

32
00:02:12.791 --> 00:02:17.530
<v Speaker 1>he does is actually amateurish when it </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes to his vlog on Youtube in general,</v>

33
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.770
<v Speaker 1>was trying to find opportunities to up </v>
<v Speaker 1>my game.</v>

34
00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.280
<v Speaker 1>When it comes to production.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Value Neistat has been slowly developing</v>

35
00:02:24.281 --> 00:02:25.114
<v Speaker 1>his style from the start in 2003.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He and his brother made a short film </v>

36
00:02:28.091 --> 00:02:28.924
<v Speaker 1>called ipod dirty secret about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>crappiness of Ipod batteries that </v>

37
00:02:32.291 --> 00:02:37.291
<v Speaker 1>collected over a million views in six </v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks in the era before youtube,</v>

38
00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.770
<v Speaker 1>hybrid combination of Gonzo journalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guerrilla filmmaking and cinema verite.</v>

39
00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.180
<v Speaker 1>This signature evolved across a number </v>
<v Speaker 1>of short movies and eventually found its</v>

40
00:02:46.181 --> 00:02:50.710
<v Speaker 1>way into the Vlog for which it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect match and cinema verite.</v>

41
00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.190
<v Speaker 1>The camera is often acknowledged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>made a part of the product.</v>

42
00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:55.293
<v Speaker 1>Neistat takes this to another level by </v>
<v Speaker 1>making his massive collection of camera </v>

43
00:02:58.421 --> 00:03:01.840
<v Speaker 1>equipment and the studio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another character in his show,</v>

44
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.630
<v Speaker 1>dslrs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gopros power shots,</v>

45
00:03:04.631 --> 00:03:06.100
<v Speaker 1>three sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>iphones,</v>

46
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.993
<v Speaker 1>drones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each camera and each lens has its own </v>

47
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.010
<v Speaker 1>personality and Neistat's constantly </v>
<v Speaker 1>swapping them around,</v>

48
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:13.293
<v Speaker 1>but it goes further than this nice that </v>
<v Speaker 1>keeps all his old footage routinely </v>

49
00:03:16.421 --> 00:03:19.780
<v Speaker 1>working in mini dv memories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vhs tapes,</v>

50
00:03:19.781 --> 00:03:23.710
<v Speaker 1>and other first generation video camera </v>
<v Speaker 1>clips within this universe.</v>

51
00:03:23.711 --> 00:03:26.080
<v Speaker 1>Old Video camera footage doesn't look </v>
<v Speaker 1>dated.</v>

52
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.973
<v Speaker 1>It's just another strata and the ongoing</v>
<v Speaker 1>story of the democratization of </v>

53
00:03:30.491 --> 00:03:33.430
<v Speaker 1>filmmaking story that parallels our </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives.</v>

54
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.900
<v Speaker 1>His main rig,</v>
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

55
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.320
<v Speaker 1>is this a Canon Seventy d on a gorilla </v>
<v Speaker 1>pod.</v>

56
00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.473
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this tells you everything you need to </v>

57
00:03:40.421 --> 00:03:41.254
<v Speaker 1>know about neistat stat as a filmmaker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a heavy thing to carry all day </v>

58
00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.400
<v Speaker 1>daily vloggers before this may do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>handheld,</v>

59
00:03:48.401 --> 00:03:49.234
<v Speaker 1>so varying sizes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>powershot small enough to fit in your </v>

60
00:03:51.341 --> 00:03:52.174
<v Speaker 1>pocket.</v>

61
00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.940
<v Speaker 1>The idea was that it was always with you</v>
<v Speaker 1>on obtrusive.</v>

62
00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.100
<v Speaker 1>Neistat has a slightly different emo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wants to show to feel natural,</v>

63
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.400
<v Speaker 1>not be natural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My goal with this blog isn't,</v>

64
00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.120
<v Speaker 1>and it has never been to like share all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the intimacies of my life.</v>

65
00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:08.253
<v Speaker 1>It's always just been to create a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>or entertaining piece of content every </v>

66
00:04:12.611 --> 00:04:13.444
<v Speaker 1>day and so to up his production value </v>
<v Speaker 1>takes a million little things like </v>

67
00:04:16.721 --> 00:04:18.670
<v Speaker 1>setting a camera down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>framing a shot,</v>

68
00:04:18.671 --> 00:04:21.730
<v Speaker 1>then running back out of frame to come </v>
<v Speaker 1>into frame again,</v>

69
00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.280
<v Speaker 1>like the shot I showed at the beginning </v>
<v Speaker 1>of this video,</v>

70
00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.950
<v Speaker 1>like going out at sunset and waiting 30 </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes.</v>

71
00:04:26.951 --> 00:04:27.784
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three different cameras take three </v>

72
00:04:28.871 --> 00:04:33.220
<v Speaker 1>different timelapses like carrying a 70 </v>
<v Speaker 1>d on a gorilla pot all day,</v>

73
00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:34.083
<v Speaker 1>like carrying a 70 d and a gorilla pod </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a boosted board controller all in </v>

74
00:04:37.511 --> 00:04:40.360
<v Speaker 1>the same hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just to look natural.</v>

75
00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:41.283
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to eat sean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to ride the boosted board record </v>

76
00:04:43.121 --> 00:04:45.730
<v Speaker 1>with a video camera and drink a smoothie</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the same time.</v>

77
00:04:45.731 --> 00:04:46.690
<v Speaker 1>How's it going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>John?</v>

78
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.860
<v Speaker 1>The effortlessness of Casey Neistat's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Flog is an illusion.</v>

79
00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:54.813
<v Speaker 1>The next time you watch one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just pay more attention to his camera </v>

80
00:04:56.981 --> 00:04:58.840
<v Speaker 1>setups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Notice how things are framed.</v>

81
00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.250
<v Speaker 1>Notice how his timelapses always feature</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of large movement.</v>

82
00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.920
<v Speaker 1>Notice how edits through action feels so</v>
<v Speaker 1>smooth,</v>

83
00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.340
<v Speaker 1>and then think about what actually was </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening there.</v>

84
00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.233
<v Speaker 1>There are a lot of things on youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but only a few of them are legitimately </v>

85
00:05:13.691 --> 00:05:14.524
<v Speaker 1>something new under the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These new styles cultivated not from </v>

86
00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:19.263
<v Speaker 1>film or TV,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but out of how we watch and share </v>

87
00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:22.593
<v Speaker 1>specifically online video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to be acknowledged and studied and </v>

88
00:05:26.291 --> 00:05:27.124
<v Speaker 1>celebrate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we want this medium to be recognized </v>

89
00:05:29.021 --> 00:05:32.080
<v Speaker 1>as something other than the stepchild of</v>
<v Speaker 1>older formats,</v>

90
00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.680
<v Speaker 1>I get a thrill watching Neistat's work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm motivated by it,</v>

91
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.460
<v Speaker 1>by the art that's in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and how wonderfully visible it can be.</v>

92
00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:40.473
<v Speaker 1>It's a style you can't duplicate because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the show is animated and held together </v>

93
00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:47.560
<v Speaker 1>by his energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that ought to be encouraging because</v>

94
00:05:47.561 --> 00:05:49.600
<v Speaker 1>it means that in the age of online </v>
<v Speaker 1>video,</v>

95
00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:53.500
<v Speaker 1>when a creation can be the unmediated </v>
<v Speaker 1>vision of its creator,</v>

96
00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:58.850
<v Speaker 1>there's the style within all of us and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are millions of people waiting for</v>

97
00:06:00.201 --> 00:06:00.980
<v Speaker 1>you to find it.</v>
