00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:08.463
<v Speaker 1>Nights ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my girlfriend and I had a couple drinks </v>

2
00:00:09.991 --> 00:00:10.824
<v Speaker 1>and convinced ourselves that we needed </v>
<v Speaker 1>to go down the street to bonds for </v>

3
00:00:14.251 --> 00:00:15.084
<v Speaker 1>snacks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We ended up with a sort of weird </v>

4
00:00:16.651 --> 00:00:19.980
<v Speaker 1>grouping of six items,</v>
<v Speaker 1>toasted sesame water crackers,</v>

5
00:00:19.981 --> 00:00:23.100
<v Speaker 1>some smoked mozzarella cheese chick pea </v>
<v Speaker 1>chips,</v>

6
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.680
<v Speaker 1>it dozen eggs because you always need </v>
<v Speaker 1>eggs.</v>

7
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:26.573
<v Speaker 1>This sweet young coconut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I saw it near the cash register </v>

8
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.960
<v Speaker 1>and scallions because honey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't we get scallions again?</v>

9
00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.560
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

10
00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.320
<v Speaker 1>apparently nobody knows why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got the scallions.</v>

11
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.130
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we enjoyed the snacks.</v>

12
00:00:41.131 --> 00:00:44.670
<v Speaker 1>They were all really good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then I happened to look at the check</v>

13
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.790
<v Speaker 1>and I realized that I had accidentally </v>
<v Speaker 1>paid for 17 federal programs.</v>

14
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.210
<v Speaker 1>Not exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let me explain.</v>

15
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.403
<v Speaker 1>This year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the federal budget requests for the </v>

16
00:00:56.371 --> 00:01:00.060
<v Speaker 1>corporation for public broadcasting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The organization that runs pbs,</v>

17
00:01:00.061 --> 00:01:00.894
<v Speaker 1>NPR and over 1400 locally owned public </v>
<v Speaker 1>radio and television stations is </v>

18
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.690
<v Speaker 1>$445,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>using the latest census information that</v>

19
00:01:09.691 --> 00:01:14.691
<v Speaker 1>comes out to a dollar and thirty seven </v>
<v Speaker 1>cents per American per year or about the</v>

20
00:01:15.301 --> 00:01:19.350
<v Speaker 1>cost of 12 and a half toasted sesame </v>
<v Speaker 1>water crackers.</v>

21
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:20.573
<v Speaker 1>The National Endowment for the arts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once a budget of only $150 million to </v>

22
00:01:23.161 --> 00:01:23.994
<v Speaker 1>help fund our exhibitions and our </v>
<v Speaker 1>education across the country to help </v>

23
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.283
<v Speaker 1>America imagine itself artistically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Each of us has to pay just this much </v>

24
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.473
<v Speaker 1>smoked mozzarella cheese per year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might be wondering why I'm bringing </v>

25
00:01:37.231 --> 00:01:39.390
<v Speaker 1>all this up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because in the next few weeks,</v>

26
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.253
<v Speaker 1>you're likely to see the trump </v>
<v Speaker 1>administration proposed dramatic budget </v>

27
00:01:42.721 --> 00:01:43.554
<v Speaker 1>cuts to the federal government that will</v>
<v Speaker 1>seek to prioritize the corporation for </v>

28
00:01:46.441 --> 00:01:47.274
<v Speaker 1>public broadcasting and eliminate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>national endowment of the arts </v>

29
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.473
<v Speaker 1>completely as well as 15 other programs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks to some good work from Taylor </v>

30
00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.180
<v Speaker 1>temper over at Time magazine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know that taken together,</v>

31
00:01:57.181 --> 00:01:58.014
<v Speaker 1>these 17 programs will cost every </v>
<v Speaker 1>American $22 and thirty six cents per </v>

32
00:02:02.221 --> 00:02:03.054
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Here's what they'll each costs you </v>

<v Speaker 1>individually and what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cue The montage music.</v>

<v Speaker 1>For 17 percent more chicken chips.</v>

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.730
<v Speaker 1>You'll fund the office of violence </v>

<v Speaker 1>poor Americans afford legal services.</v>

55
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.690
<v Speaker 1>That'll cost you just three eggs,</v>

<v Speaker 1>That'll cost you just a couple shots of </v>

58
00:03:25.721 --> 00:03:26.554
<v Speaker 1>coconut water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plus some scallions to fund the UN </v>

<v Speaker 1>data on global warming.</v>

61
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.233
<v Speaker 1>You have to throw in just this much of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>chick pea chip you office of </v>

<v Speaker 1>stable and secure.</v>

64
00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.420
<v Speaker 1>It costs all the scallions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The scallions are really cheap,</v>

65
00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:47.463
<v Speaker 1>and finally the office of energy </v>
<v Speaker 1>efficiency and renewable energy aids </v>

66
00:03:50.261 --> 00:03:53.350
<v Speaker 1>efforts to transition America to a clean</v>
<v Speaker 1>energy economy.</v>

67
00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.540
<v Speaker 1>It's the most expensive of the bunch you</v>
<v Speaker 1>get.</v>

68
00:03:55.541 --> 00:04:00.541
<v Speaker 1>It only cost the price of one box of </v>
<v Speaker 1>water crackers and one bag of chips.</v>

69
00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:02.743
<v Speaker 1>The blueprint for these cuts comes from </v>
<v Speaker 1>a paper put out by the Heritage </v>

70
00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:06.793
<v Speaker 1>Foundation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a conservative think tank that has long </v>

71
00:04:07.761 --> 00:04:08.594
<v Speaker 1>argued for eliminating federal programs </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a way to reduce our </v>

72
00:04:11.091 --> 00:04:13.010
<v Speaker 1>$20,000,000,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>national debt.</v>

73
00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.640
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is that altogether these</v>
<v Speaker 1>programs are asking for only seven point</v>

74
00:04:19.371 --> 00:04:20.204
<v Speaker 1>$3,000,000,000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is one percent of the non defense </v>

75
00:04:23.451 --> 00:04:25.550
<v Speaker 1>discretionary spending that our </v>
<v Speaker 1>government does.</v>

76
00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:28.760
<v Speaker 1>Fully half of discretionary spending </v>
<v Speaker 1>goes to the military.</v>

77
00:04:28.761 --> 00:04:32.510
<v Speaker 1>Something that the trump administration </v>
<v Speaker 1>is not likely to slash all that much,</v>

78
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.990
<v Speaker 1>and in total,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all discretionary spending makes up only</v>

79
00:04:35.991 --> 00:04:39.380
<v Speaker 1>31 percent of the federal budget.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rest goes to social security.</v>

80
00:04:39.381 --> 00:04:40.214
<v Speaker 1>Medicare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Medicaid entitlements that trump has </v>

81
00:04:41.991 --> 00:04:45.110
<v Speaker 1>also vowed not to touch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

82
00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.973
<v Speaker 1>privatizing or eliminating b 17 programs</v>
<v Speaker 1>is really only a symbolic gesture that </v>

83
00:04:50.601 --> 00:04:51.434
<v Speaker 1>won't do much of anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The good news is that this is a fight </v>

84
00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.943
<v Speaker 1>that should be pretty easy to win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're willing to spend drunkenly or </v>

85
00:04:58.101 --> 00:04:58.934
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty $2 and thirty six cents on these </v>

86
00:05:00.731 --> 00:05:03.920
<v Speaker 1>17 programs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>call your congressman and say so,</v>

87
00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:05.173
<v Speaker 1>and if they want to know why you think </v>
<v Speaker 1>privatizing pbs or killing the National </v>

88
00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.720
<v Speaker 1>Endowment of the arts is a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit,</v>
