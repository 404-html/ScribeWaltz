00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.710
<v Speaker 1>Coffee on a Tuesday and blog 26.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm back,</v>

2
00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:05.553
<v Speaker 1>baby.</v>

3
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.600
<v Speaker 1>In the spring of 18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>18,</v>

4
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.320
<v Speaker 1>the poet John Keats wrote a letter to </v>
<v Speaker 1>his friend John Hamilton Reynolds,</v>

5
00:00:22.321 --> 00:00:27.090
<v Speaker 1>which contained in it a poetic metaphor </v>
<v Speaker 1>for how he saw human life.</v>

6
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.983
<v Speaker 1>He called it the mansion of many </v>
<v Speaker 1>apartments and the image goes sort of </v>

7
00:00:32.221 --> 00:00:34.230
<v Speaker 1>like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first department we step into,</v>

8
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.120
<v Speaker 1>he calls the thoughtless chamber here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We remain for as long as we do not think</v>

9
00:00:39.121 --> 00:00:39.954
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think keats means by this thinking </v>

10
00:00:41.671 --> 00:00:43.140
<v Speaker 1>deeply,</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophically,</v>

11
00:00:43.141 --> 00:00:44.100
<v Speaker 1>poetically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>

12
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.850
<v Speaker 1>and the whole time we're in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>chamber,</v>

13
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.043
<v Speaker 1>this apartment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the door to the next department is wide </v>

14
00:00:51.901 --> 00:00:54.480
<v Speaker 1>open,</v>
<v Speaker 1>showing a bright appearance on the other</v>

15
00:00:54.481 --> 00:00:56.970
<v Speaker 1>side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now at first,</v>

16
00:00:56.971 --> 00:00:58.860
<v Speaker 1>maybe we have no motivation to move </v>
<v Speaker 1>toward it,</v>

17
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.480
<v Speaker 1>but slowly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually the thinking principle impels</v>

18
00:01:03.481 --> 00:01:06.220
<v Speaker 1>us to and we go in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

19
00:01:06.221 --> 00:01:08.250
<v Speaker 1>once we get inside into the second </v>
<v Speaker 1>chamber,</v>

20
00:01:08.251 --> 00:01:09.084
<v Speaker 1>which keeps calls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Chamber of maiden thought we become </v>

21
00:01:12.331 --> 00:01:14.790
<v Speaker 1>intoxicated by the light and atmosphere.</v>

22
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:15.623
<v Speaker 1>We see nothing but pleasant wonders and </v>
<v Speaker 1>think of the laying there forever in </v>

23
00:01:18.871 --> 00:01:20.460
<v Speaker 1>delight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

24
00:01:20.461 --> 00:01:24.750
<v Speaker 1>we get a taste of the ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the mood changes,</v>

25
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.973
<v Speaker 1>one of the effects of sharpening one's </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind and the Chamber of maiden thought </v>

26
00:01:28.531 --> 00:01:31.620
<v Speaker 1>is that one begins to see deeper into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the heart of man,</v>

27
00:01:31.621 --> 00:01:33.210
<v Speaker 1>into the misery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pain,</v>

28
00:01:33.211 --> 00:01:36.510
<v Speaker 1>sickness and depression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the world is full of.</v>

29
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.410
<v Speaker 1>These things gradually begin to darken </v>
<v Speaker 1>the chamber,</v>

30
00:01:40.411 --> 00:01:41.244
<v Speaker 1>fill it with the fog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time that it gets dark </v>

31
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:45.413
<v Speaker 1>on all sides of the room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doors are set open leading away to dark </v>

32
00:01:51.271 --> 00:01:52.104
<v Speaker 1>passages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which it then becomes one's choice to </v>

33
00:01:53.911 --> 00:01:56.910
<v Speaker 1>take or not take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see that even in a letter,</v>

34
00:01:56.911 --> 00:01:59.220
<v Speaker 1>keats's powers of description are </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary.</v>

35
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.610
<v Speaker 1>He later coined the term negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>capability,</v>

36
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:03.653
<v Speaker 1>a concept to describe an artist who </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding the inherent mysteries of </v>

37
00:02:07.021 --> 00:02:11.490
<v Speaker 1>life could find the strength to remain </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be in uncertainties,</v>

38
00:02:11.491 --> 00:02:12.324
<v Speaker 1>mysteries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doubts without any irritable reaching </v>

39
00:02:14.071 --> 00:02:15.120
<v Speaker 1>after fact and reason.</v>

40
00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.223
<v Speaker 1>He cited Shakespeare as a key example of</v>
<v Speaker 1>an artist who had achieved this in 1890 </v>

41
00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.020
<v Speaker 1>a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After the letter to John Reynolds,</v>

42
00:02:22.021 --> 00:02:25.500
<v Speaker 1>keats writes his own to a nightingale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of his best works.</v>

43
00:02:25.501 --> 00:02:28.170
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the best works of poetry,</v>

44
00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.093
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight stands as long the poem tells of </v>

45
00:02:31.291 --> 00:02:32.124
<v Speaker 1>the narrators reaction to hearing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>song of a nightingale to bird being </v>

46
00:02:35.641 --> 00:02:36.474
<v Speaker 1>representative of the ideal and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>profound longing to join it even at the </v>

47
00:02:41.041 --> 00:02:41.874
<v Speaker 1>expense of his life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The poem starts with the narrator </v>

48
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.193
<v Speaker 1>becoming paralyzed by the bird song,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which commences a journey through the </v>

49
00:02:49.981 --> 00:02:52.050
<v Speaker 1>layers of his soul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

50
00:02:52.051 --> 00:02:52.884
<v Speaker 1>in a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to put a link up here </v>

51
00:02:54.901 --> 00:02:55.734
<v Speaker 1>probably right here to another video </v>
<v Speaker 1>where all recite the poem for you </v>

52
00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.873
<v Speaker 1>because poems like this should be heard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in the corner somewhere in one of </v>

53
00:03:03.491 --> 00:03:04.324
<v Speaker 1>these corners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to put numbers corresponding </v>

54
00:03:07.001 --> 00:03:09.780
<v Speaker 1>to the stanza so that you'll have a sign</v>
<v Speaker 1>posts,</v>

55
00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:10.750
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>

56
00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:11.603
<v Speaker 1>as we go along,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to keep in mind the metaphor of the </v>

57
00:03:14.531 --> 00:03:18.040
<v Speaker 1>management of many apartments and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>concept of negative capability.</v>

58
00:03:18.041 --> 00:03:19.950
<v Speaker 1>While I'm reading it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

59
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.973
<v Speaker 1>it might be worthwhile to say that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>general rule with art is that you could </v>

60
00:03:24.581 --> 00:03:27.880
<v Speaker 1>have any feeling about it that you damn </v>
<v Speaker 1>well please,</v>

61
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:29.043
<v Speaker 1>but whatever you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you know you fancy in terms of </v>

62
00:03:32.831 --> 00:03:33.664
<v Speaker 1>art,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's good to memorize poems I highly </v>

63
00:03:36.611 --> 00:03:37.444
<v Speaker 1>recommended,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you want to memorize one of your </v>

64
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.130
<v Speaker 1>favorite poems and recite it and posted </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a rated video response,</v>

65
00:03:42.131 --> 00:03:46.270
<v Speaker 1>I will most certainly put it up on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>video so</v>

66
00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:47.810
<v Speaker 2>the link should be there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

67
00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.180
<v Speaker 2>maybe here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

72
00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.100
<v Speaker 2>It's a good poem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I promise.</v>

73
00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:08.080
<v Speaker 2>You have to believe me.</v>
