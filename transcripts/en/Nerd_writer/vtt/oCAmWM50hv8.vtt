<v Speaker 1>There is a certain natural phenomenon </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you may or may not be familiar </v>

2
00:00:09.241 --> 00:00:10.074
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a facial expression made by the human </v>

3
00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:14.940
<v Speaker 1>when one of its number is holding and </v>
<v Speaker 1>reading a book.</v>

4
00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:17.443
<v Speaker 1>The head is slightly raised,</v>
<v Speaker 1>turned at 20 to 30 degrees from the </v>

5
00:00:21.301 --> 00:00:25.950
<v Speaker 1>forward eyes widen slowly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pupils dilate.</v>

6
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:26.813
<v Speaker 1>Vision enhances this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>followed by a momentary paralysis in </v>

7
00:00:30.691 --> 00:00:33.840
<v Speaker 1>which a number of subjects have recorded</v>
<v Speaker 1>a feeling of quote,</v>

8
00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.620
<v Speaker 1>loveliness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here it is in its closest approximation,</v>

9
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.560
<v Speaker 1>and here are some of the commonly sited </v>
<v Speaker 1>causes.</v>

10
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:47.423
<v Speaker 1>What is that feeling when you're driving</v>
<v Speaker 1>away from people and they recede on the </v>

11
00:00:49.741 --> 00:00:51.810
<v Speaker 1>plane till you see their specs </v>
<v Speaker 1>dispersing.</v>

12
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.980
<v Speaker 1>It's the two huge world vaulting us and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's goodbye,</v>

13
00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.263
<v Speaker 1>but we lean forward to the next crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>venture beneath the skies for a moment </v>

14
00:01:00.631 --> 00:01:01.464
<v Speaker 1>of phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tried to take shape in my mouth and my </v>

15
00:01:02.701 --> 00:01:06.450
<v Speaker 1>lips parted like a dumb man's as though </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was more struggling upon them than</v>

16
00:01:06.451 --> 00:01:07.284
<v Speaker 1>a wisp of startled air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they made no sound and what I had </v>

17
00:01:10.441 --> 00:01:13.020
<v Speaker 1>almost remembered was incommunicable </v>
<v Speaker 1>forever.</v>

18
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.273
<v Speaker 1>A solemn consideration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I enter a great city by night that </v>

19
00:01:17.191 --> 00:01:18.024
<v Speaker 1>every one of those darkly clustered </v>
<v Speaker 1>houses in closes its own secret that </v>

20
00:01:21.361 --> 00:01:24.210
<v Speaker 1>every room and every one of them </v>
<v Speaker 1>encloses it's own secret,</v>

21
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.130
<v Speaker 1>that every beating heart in the hundreds</v>
<v Speaker 1>of thousands of breasts there is in some</v>

22
00:01:29.131 --> 00:01:31.000
<v Speaker 1>of it's imagining,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so secret to the heart,</v>

23
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.340
<v Speaker 1>nearest it.</v>

24
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.530
<v Speaker 1>There are more things in heaven and </v>
<v Speaker 1>earth,</v>

25
00:01:34.531 --> 00:01:37.260
<v Speaker 1>Horatio than are dreamt of in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy.</v>

26
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.570
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you know the feeling and if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

27
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:40.583
<v Speaker 1>you could like I did produce a list of </v>
<v Speaker 1>quotes that triggers the same natural </v>

28
00:01:44.101 --> 00:01:44.934
<v Speaker 1>phenomenon in you and knowing that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know that these words don't just knock </v>

29
00:01:47.851 --> 00:01:48.684
<v Speaker 1>us around intellectually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but physically they twist us into knots </v>

30
00:01:51.781 --> 00:01:52.614
<v Speaker 1>or untie the tightest ones within us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They put us face to face with our </v>

31
00:01:55.141 --> 00:01:57.660
<v Speaker 1>illusions are bigotries our </v>
<v Speaker 1>preconceptions.</v>

32
00:01:57.661 --> 00:01:58.494
<v Speaker 1>You know that to grasp just one sentence</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the very best writing is to grasp a </v>

33
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.120
<v Speaker 1>thousand sentences of great writing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to grasp 10,000</v>

34
00:02:06.121 --> 00:02:07.560
<v Speaker 1>sentences of good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

35
00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.800
<v Speaker 1>And in this way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great books are very expensive things.</v>

36
00:02:10.801 --> 00:02:14.310
<v Speaker 1>They come at the cost of thousands and </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of sentences.</v>

37
00:02:14.311 --> 00:02:15.144
<v Speaker 1>They come at the cost of dozens of </v>
<v Speaker 1>easier books and children's books and </v>

38
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.480
<v Speaker 1>picture books and simple poems and sing </v>
<v Speaker 1>along songs.</v>

39
00:02:21.481 --> 00:02:25.050
<v Speaker 1>They come at the cost of a room to read </v>
<v Speaker 1>room to read,</v>

40
00:02:25.051 --> 00:02:25.884
<v Speaker 1>promotes literacy around the world by </v>
<v Speaker 1>building libraries and getting kids </v>

41
00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.280
<v Speaker 1>access to books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>helping millions to put their very first</v>

42
00:02:32.281 --> 00:02:33.114
<v Speaker 1>down payments on dickens or Shakespeare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a phenomenon we should help </v>

43
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:39.630
<v Speaker 1>everyone to feel</v>

44
00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.750
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
