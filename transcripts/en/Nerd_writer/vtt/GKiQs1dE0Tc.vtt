1
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:03.480
<v Speaker 1>So there's a great scene near the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning of shame,</v>

2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.680
<v Speaker 1>blacks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nice guys,</v>

3
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.420
<v Speaker 1>which more people should have seen in </v>
<v Speaker 1>theaters,</v>

4
00:00:06.421 --> 00:00:07.171
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

5
00:00:07.171 --> 00:00:08.760
<v Speaker 1>Fuck the angry birds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

6
00:00:08.761 --> 00:00:12.180
<v Speaker 1>we're Ryan gosling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A private investigator breaks into a bar</v>

7
00:00:12.181 --> 00:00:13.014
<v Speaker 1>to get his hands on some receipts like </v>
<v Speaker 1>we've seen people do a million times </v>

8
00:00:15.931 --> 00:00:16.764
<v Speaker 1>before in movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gosling is going to break the glass to </v>

9
00:00:18.241 --> 00:00:23.241
<v Speaker 1>unlock the door from inside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but things really don't go as planned.</v>

10
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.013
<v Speaker 1>Besides being a hilariously funny </v>
<v Speaker 1>reversal and subversion of an old </v>

11
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.570
<v Speaker 1>cliche,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this moment gets to the heart of</v>

12
00:00:33.571 --> 00:00:37.380
<v Speaker 1>Shane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blacks interests in awkward violence and</v>

13
00:00:37.381 --> 00:00:38.880
<v Speaker 1>deeper than that in film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new wars,</v>

14
00:00:38.881 --> 00:00:43.140
<v Speaker 1>obsession with violence as the undying </v>
<v Speaker 1>backdrop to civilization.</v>

15
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:44.573
<v Speaker 1>Speaking of backdrops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you made not be familiar with Shane </v>

16
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.600
<v Speaker 1>Black,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but his work has been in the backdrop of</v>

17
00:00:48.601 --> 00:00:49.434
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood for 30 years now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>starting as a writer during the SPEC </v>

18
00:00:52.261 --> 00:00:54.330
<v Speaker 1>script boom of the late eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nineties,</v>

19
00:00:54.331 --> 00:00:58.200
<v Speaker 1>and early two thousands when unsolicited</v>
<v Speaker 1>original scripts were really high.</v>

20
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.340
<v Speaker 1>Demand Black wrote lethal weapon one end</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the last boy scout,</v>

21
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.233
<v Speaker 1>long kiss goodnight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then went on to direct his written work </v>

22
00:01:05.011 --> 00:01:06.120
<v Speaker 1>in films like kiss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kiss,</v>

23
00:01:06.121 --> 00:01:06.680
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>

24
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.220
<v Speaker 1>iron man three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and finally the Nice guys.</v>

25
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.133
<v Speaker 1>All of these films share similar themes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'll have fractured characters all </v>

26
00:01:13.231 --> 00:01:15.150
<v Speaker 1>take place in dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>often.</v>

27
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.970
<v Speaker 1>See me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Worlds all have whipped fast plots,</v>

28
00:01:17.971 --> 00:01:19.260
<v Speaker 1>reversals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>betrayals,</v>

29
00:01:19.261 --> 00:01:21.360
<v Speaker 1>and plenty of character revealing </v>
<v Speaker 1>banter.</v>

30
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.230
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they all share the traits of film noir.</v>

31
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.153
<v Speaker 1>There's a certain madness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in a certain bizarre quality of </v>

32
00:01:29.491 --> 00:01:32.490
<v Speaker 1>violence in the war films where it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>devastating.</v>

33
00:01:32.491 --> 00:01:35.460
<v Speaker 1>It's just ongoing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just clever.</v>

34
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:36.660
<v Speaker 1>It's devastating.</v>

35
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.810
<v Speaker 1>At this point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're clearly not lacking in violence at</v>

36
00:01:42.811 --> 00:01:43.644
<v Speaker 1>the movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blockbuster and tent pole films are a </v>

37
00:01:45.451 --> 00:01:47.100
<v Speaker 1>wash in this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Explosions,</v>

38
00:01:47.101 --> 00:01:48.570
<v Speaker 1>car crashes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chases,</v>

39
00:01:48.571 --> 00:01:49.890
<v Speaker 1>fights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you name it.</v>

40
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.400
<v Speaker 1>There are some directors and stunt </v>
<v Speaker 1>coordinators who are really good at it.</v>

41
00:01:53.401 --> 00:01:54.234
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Captain America Franchise I think </v>

42
00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:56.783
<v Speaker 1>has mastered a very sharp part hitting </v>
<v Speaker 1>type of superhero violence where other </v>

43
00:02:00.331 --> 00:02:03.000
<v Speaker 1>franchises have struggled to meet that </v>
<v Speaker 1>bar,</v>

44
00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.360
<v Speaker 1>but the thing about violence in </v>
<v Speaker 1>superhero films is that it's fun,</v>

45
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.223
<v Speaker 1>but never really that consequential,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly if it's heroes fighting </v>

46
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.090
<v Speaker 1>heroes come on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>black widow,</v>

47
00:02:12.091 --> 00:02:14.010
<v Speaker 1>you know these people are slated until </v>
<v Speaker 1>like 20,</v>

48
00:02:14.011 --> 00:02:14.844
<v Speaker 1>22,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

49
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:16.403
<v Speaker 1>A lot of these films add violence to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mix to spice up things every 20 minutes </v>

50
00:02:20.311 --> 00:02:21.144
<v Speaker 1>or so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they write themselves up to the brink </v>

51
00:02:22.681 --> 00:02:24.690
<v Speaker 1>and then let the stunt coordinators take</v>
<v Speaker 1>it from there,</v>

52
00:02:24.691 --> 00:02:26.940
<v Speaker 1>making sure a few beats or hit along the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

53
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.520
<v Speaker 1>This isn't necessarily bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it's awesome,</v>

54
00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:30.413
<v Speaker 1>but it's not all that violence can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question you should be asking isn't </v>

55
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.110
<v Speaker 1>where you should add violence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how can you use it?</v>

56
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.300
<v Speaker 1>Take that scene from the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With gosling,</v>

57
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.030
<v Speaker 1>it accomplishes so much in such a short </v>
<v Speaker 1>period of time.</v>

58
00:02:42.031 --> 00:02:44.130
<v Speaker 1>It subverts that cliche for comedic </v>
<v Speaker 1>effect.</v>

59
00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.470
<v Speaker 1>It's a quick reversal of narrative </v>
<v Speaker 1>momentum.</v>

60
00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.140
<v Speaker 1>It shows how hapless gosling's character</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

61
00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.173
<v Speaker 1>and an accidental slitting of the risk </v>
<v Speaker 1>plays into the deeper sadness that </v>

62
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.203
<v Speaker 1>underlies his drunkenness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of 40 and slit shane black is a </v>

63
00:02:57.601 --> 00:03:02.110
<v Speaker 1>master at using violence to augment </v>
<v Speaker 1>story and character in his action.</v>

64
00:03:02.111 --> 00:03:06.280
<v Speaker 1>Thrillers and neo wars want to show that</v>
<v Speaker 1>a police detective his past his prime.</v>

65
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:08.103
<v Speaker 1>What if you want to show that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>detective craves violence in an almost </v>

66
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.390
<v Speaker 1>masochistic way in blacks films,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the violence is often messy and shocking</v>

67
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.630
<v Speaker 1>and awkward because that's what real </v>
<v Speaker 1>violence is like.</v>

68
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.090
<v Speaker 1>It's a kind of chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a rupture in things.</v>

69
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.780
<v Speaker 1>The inciting incident in a long kiss </v>
<v Speaker 1>goodnight is a perfect example of this.</v>

70
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:26.793
<v Speaker 1>Gina Davis hits a deer with her car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would be enough to send the car </v>

71
00:03:29.951 --> 00:03:30.784
<v Speaker 1>careening off the road by itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but black has the deer come through the </v>

72
00:03:34.361 --> 00:03:36.310
<v Speaker 1>windshield,</v>
<v Speaker 1>still alive,</v>

73
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:40.900
<v Speaker 1>kicking the passenger in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is awkward and transfixing in a way</v>

74
00:03:40.901 --> 00:03:44.110
<v Speaker 1>that leaves us on guarded against the </v>
<v Speaker 1>violence of the moment.</v>

75
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:45.363
<v Speaker 1>In consequence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we become more present for the whole </v>

76
00:03:46.961 --> 00:03:49.630
<v Speaker 1>scene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The pencil trick in the dark night,</v>

77
00:03:49.631 --> 00:03:51.640
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>achieves a similar effect.</v>

78
00:03:51.641 --> 00:03:55.540
<v Speaker 1>Another thing black likes to do is visit</v>
<v Speaker 1>violence on an otherwise piece.</v>

79
00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:02.570
<v Speaker 1>The thing that black likes to do is </v>
<v Speaker 1>visit.</v>

80
00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:07.780
<v Speaker 2>Maybe</v>

81
00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.970
<v Speaker 1>I should just let black say it in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>own words,</v>

82
00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.893
<v Speaker 1>in this country where we think </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything's settled and stable and </v>

83
00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.983
<v Speaker 1>serene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something horribly violent can intrude </v>

84
00:04:17.591 --> 00:04:18.424
<v Speaker 1>upon our piece and then we have to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>back to this gunslinger who knew all </v>

85
00:04:20.441 --> 00:04:22.450
<v Speaker 1>along that the war wasn't over in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>west,</v>

86
00:04:22.451 --> 00:04:23.284
<v Speaker 1>wasn't gentrified,</v>
<v Speaker 1>black uses sudden violence not only to </v>

87
00:04:25.451 --> 00:04:26.284
<v Speaker 1>shock the audience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as a way to justify an animate his </v>

88
00:04:28.421 --> 00:04:29.254
<v Speaker 1>heroes and heroines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The point is that this is violence with </v>

89
00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.190
<v Speaker 1>narrative purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That purpose may be as simple as keeping</v>

90
00:04:36.191 --> 00:04:41.191
<v Speaker 1>the audience on their toes or fingers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>finger,</v>

91
00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:43.693
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it may be a way to solve a simple </v>

92
00:04:45.401 --> 00:04:46.234
<v Speaker 1>problem or it might reveal what a </v>
<v Speaker 1>character's really like or who he would </v>

93
00:04:54.401 --> 00:04:59.401
<v Speaker 1>like to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just we all live around violence,</v>

94
00:04:59.651 --> 00:05:04.651
<v Speaker 1>but by and large were separate from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A good new or thriller lets us travel to</v>

95
00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:07.150
<v Speaker 1>the other side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dip our feet into that current,</v>

96
00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:08.860
<v Speaker 1>feel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how cold it is,</v>

97
00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:12.010
<v Speaker 1>if we've had the bad fortune to </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience it firsthand,</v>

98
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.903
<v Speaker 1>we know that violence can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>indiscriminate and deeply personal at </v>

99
00:05:17.261 --> 00:05:19.480
<v Speaker 1>the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>violence done right in these movies.</v>

100
00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.600
<v Speaker 1>Violence as a plot element or an </v>
<v Speaker 1>exhibition of character.</v>

101
00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.570
<v Speaker 1>Awkward violence is violence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>respected.</v>

102
00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:26.920
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the end of the day,</v>

103
00:05:26.921 --> 00:05:28.510
<v Speaker 1>these are just movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pulpy,</v>

104
00:05:28.511 --> 00:05:30.280
<v Speaker 1>detective stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>genre flicks,</v>

105
00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:31.683
<v Speaker 1>but I wouldn't want to live in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe that didn't have pulpy genre </v>

106
00:05:35.291 --> 00:05:37.720
<v Speaker 1>detective movies like lethal weapon or </v>
<v Speaker 1>kiss,</v>

107
00:05:37.721 --> 00:05:38.350
<v Speaker 1>kiss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>

108
00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:39.183
<v Speaker 1>Bang.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Shane Black is one of the few </v>

109
00:05:40.571 --> 00:05:45.250
<v Speaker 1>action thriller writers who incorporates</v>
<v Speaker 1>violence into his scripts creatively and</v>

110
00:05:45.251 --> 00:05:47.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad he's still getting work for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that to keep happening.</v>

111
00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.980
<v Speaker 1>Of course we have to keep going to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>his movies and it.</v>

112
00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:55.510
<v Speaker 1>Unless that is your okay with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>alternative</v>

113
00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.030
<v Speaker 2>to the birds.</v>

114
00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:12.640
<v Speaker 1>There is a new nerd writer video every </v>
<v Speaker 1>Wednesday,</v>

115
00:06:12.641 --> 00:06:14.980
<v Speaker 1>so if you go right to that box right </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and click that,</v>

116
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.970
<v Speaker 1>you'll subscribe and get all the videos </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what helps me out the most in</v>
