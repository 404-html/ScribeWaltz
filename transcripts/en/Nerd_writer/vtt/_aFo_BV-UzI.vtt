1
00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:01.273
<v Speaker 1>But isn't it on America and wrong to </v>
<v Speaker 1>discriminate against people based on </v>

2
00:00:04.641 --> 00:00:05.474
<v Speaker 1>their religion?</v>

3
00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:06.423
<v Speaker 2>Really the problem.</v>

4
00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.150
<v Speaker 3>We have people coming into our country </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are looking to do tremendous harm.</v>

5
00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:17.440
<v Speaker 3>You look at the t,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at Paris,</v>

6
00:00:17.441 --> 00:00:19.930
<v Speaker 3>look at what happened in Paris.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean these people,</v>

7
00:00:19.931 --> 00:00:21.910
<v Speaker 3>they did not come from Sweden.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

8
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.133
<v Speaker 3>Look at what happened in Paris.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at what happened last week in </v>

9
00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:30.001
<v Speaker 3>California with with 14 people dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Other people going to die there so badly</v>

10
00:00:30.971 --> 00:00:31.804
<v Speaker 3>injured mean we have a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a tremendous hatred out there </v>

11
00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.350
<v Speaker 3>and what I want to do is find out what </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

12
00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.680
<v Speaker 3>You can't solve a problem until you find</v>
<v Speaker 3>out what's the root core cars and I want</v>

13
00:00:41.681 --> 00:00:44.350
<v Speaker 3>to find out what is the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's going on?</v>

14
00:00:44.351 --> 00:00:45.184
<v Speaker 3>And it's temporary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had so many people call me and say </v>

15
00:00:48.161 --> 00:00:48.820
<v Speaker 3>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

16
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.500
<v Speaker 3>if you remember when I did that a week </v>
<v Speaker 3>ago,</v>

17
00:00:50.501 --> 00:00:51.334
<v Speaker 3>it was like bedlam all of a sudden and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you watched last night and you see </v>

18
00:00:54.401 --> 00:00:56.050
<v Speaker 3>people talking to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

19
00:00:56.051 --> 00:00:58.330
<v Speaker 3>trump has a point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have to get down to the problem.</v>

20
00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.870
<v Speaker 3>The people that are friends of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they called,</v>

21
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:01.750
<v Speaker 3>they said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Donald,</v>

22
00:01:01.751 --> 00:01:06.751
<v Speaker 3>you've done us a tremendous service </v>
<v Speaker 3>because we do have a problem and we have</v>

23
00:01:07.121 --> 00:01:09.960
<v Speaker 3>to find out those crank calls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those may have been.</v>

24
00:01:09.961 --> 00:01:10.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

25
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.903
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>

26
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:12.763
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I find fascinating </v>
<v Speaker 1>about Donald Trump is the way he uses </v>

27
00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.690
<v Speaker 1>language differently than other </v>
<v Speaker 1>candidates for political office,</v>

28
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.150
<v Speaker 1>especially for president of the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>

29
00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:24.283
<v Speaker 1>Whereas his opponents and the political </v>
<v Speaker 1>class in general seem hyper aware that </v>

30
00:01:27.651 --> 00:01:30.740
<v Speaker 1>their words will be picked apart and </v>
<v Speaker 1>used against them.</v>

31
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.430
<v Speaker 1>Trump willfully disregards this fact as </v>
<v Speaker 1>a lifelong salesman,</v>

32
00:01:34.431 --> 00:01:37.910
<v Speaker 1>he has a hucksters knack for selling the</v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling,</v>

33
00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.893
<v Speaker 1>even if the ideas and facts that </v>
<v Speaker 1>underscore it are spurious racist or </v>

34
00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.070
<v Speaker 1>just plain incomprehensible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I thought it would be illuminating to</v>

35
00:01:46.071 --> 00:01:48.680
<v Speaker 1>look at a trump answer to a simple </v>
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>

36
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.530
<v Speaker 1>In this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy Kimmel asking trump whether or not</v>

37
00:01:51.531 --> 00:01:55.190
<v Speaker 1>it's wrong to discriminate against </v>
<v Speaker 1>people based on their religion,</v>

38
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.233
<v Speaker 1>referring to trump's proposal to </v>
<v Speaker 1>temporarily ban all Muslims from </v>

39
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.480
<v Speaker 1>entering the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This 220 word,</v>

40
00:02:02.481 --> 00:02:07.100
<v Speaker 1>exactly one minute answer displays.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a range of the things that trump</v>

41
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.963
<v Speaker 1>uses all the time in his speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing to note is how simple </v>

42
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.153
<v Speaker 1>this languages of the 220 words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a 172 or 78 percent are only one </v>

43
00:02:19.101 --> 00:02:21.830
<v Speaker 1>syllable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and often they come in a rhythmic series</v>

44
00:02:21.831 --> 00:02:25.520
<v Speaker 1>like a volley of Jabs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ending with one of his buzzwords.</v>

45
00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:26.383
<v Speaker 1>We have to get down to the prop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thirty nine words or 17 percent are two </v>

46
00:02:29.601 --> 00:02:33.440
<v Speaker 1>syllables long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Only four words have three syllables,</v>

47
00:02:33.441 --> 00:02:35.780
<v Speaker 1>three of which are the word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tremendous,</v>

48
00:02:35.781 --> 00:02:37.270
<v Speaker 1>tremendous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tremendous,</v>

49
00:02:37.271 --> 00:02:39.620
<v Speaker 1>and just two words are four syllables </v>
<v Speaker 1>long,</v>

50
00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:40.483
<v Speaker 1>California,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which he's forced to use because it has </v>

51
00:02:42.171 --> 00:02:45.590
<v Speaker 1>less syllables than San Bernardino and </v>
<v Speaker 1>temporary,</v>

52
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.633
<v Speaker 1>which he swallows and it's temporary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had so many people just breakdown </v>

53
00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:51.523
<v Speaker 1>fits with the study done by the Boston </v>
<v Speaker 1>Globe that put all 2016 presidential </v>

54
00:02:55.431 --> 00:02:58.340
<v Speaker 1>candidates announcement speeches through</v>
<v Speaker 1>the flesh,</v>

55
00:02:58.341 --> 00:03:02.740
<v Speaker 1>kincade readability tests to determine </v>
<v Speaker 1>their respective grade level rankings.</v>

56
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.760
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump's speech came out at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fourth grade reading level.</v>

57
00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.150
<v Speaker 1>Now for reference,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ben Carson came out at sixth grade.</v>

58
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:11.103
<v Speaker 1>Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush were </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking at an eighth grade reading </v>

59
00:03:13.271 --> 00:03:14.104
<v Speaker 1>level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Bernie Sanders was way up in high </v>

60
00:03:16.211 --> 00:03:18.070
<v Speaker 1>school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sophomore to be exact.</v>

61
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.940
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this isn't only down to word or syllable</v>

62
00:03:21.941 --> 00:03:22.510
<v Speaker 1>choice.</v>

63
00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.400
<v Speaker 1>It's about sentence construction to </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump favors simple sentences like,</v>

64
00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.850
<v Speaker 1>and we have a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a tremendous hatred out there.</v>

65
00:03:30.851 --> 00:03:34.960
<v Speaker 1>Rarely does he use complex sentences or </v>
<v Speaker 1>independent clauses.</v>

66
00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.093
<v Speaker 1>You also favors the second person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of time addressing listeners </v>

67
00:03:38.591 --> 00:03:40.810
<v Speaker 1>directly with commands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at Paris,</v>

68
00:03:40.811 --> 00:03:43.240
<v Speaker 1>look at what happened in Paris.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at what happened in past.</v>

69
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:44.103
<v Speaker 1>Look at what happened last week in </v>
<v Speaker 1>California or implicating us in what </v>

70
00:03:46.751 --> 00:03:47.584
<v Speaker 1>he's saying as if we've already agreed </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you watched last night and you see </v>

71
00:03:50.801 --> 00:03:51.634
<v Speaker 1>people talking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's really good at this at framing </v>

72
00:03:53.771 --> 00:03:58.270
<v Speaker 1>negative response as an overreaction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was subsequently realized as such.</v>

73
00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:59.990
<v Speaker 1>If you remember when I did that a week </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>

74
00:03:59.991 --> 00:04:00.824
<v Speaker 1>it was like bedlam all of a sudden and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you watch last night and you see people </v>

75
00:04:04.211 --> 00:04:05.500
<v Speaker 1>talking to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

76
00:04:05.501 --> 00:04:07.750
<v Speaker 1>trump has a point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to get down to the problem.</v>

77
00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:08.613
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the most important technique trump</v>
<v Speaker 1>utilizes and he does this more than </v>

78
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.000
<v Speaker 1>anyone I've ever heard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is ending his sentences with strong,</v>

79
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:17.290
<v Speaker 1>punchy words.</v>

80
00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.153
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times he'll rearrange the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning of a sentence awkwardly so </v>

81
00:04:20.561 --> 00:04:23.020
<v Speaker 1>that he can end strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

82
00:04:23.021 --> 00:04:25.360
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would probably be more natural to say</v>

83
00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.440
<v Speaker 1>you can't solve a problem until you find</v>
<v Speaker 1>out what the root cause is,</v>

84
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.940
<v Speaker 1>but he brings the is forward to end on </v>
<v Speaker 1>root cause.</v>

85
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.833
<v Speaker 1>He does the same here and it looks like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what he was about to do at the </v>

86
00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.620
<v Speaker 1>end before Kim will cut some off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These final words are crucial for trump.</v>

87
00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:42.813
<v Speaker 1>They're pointed and taken together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sketch the theme of the entire answer </v>

88
00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:49.530
<v Speaker 1>are dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Die Badly injured problem root cars.</v>

89
00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.750
<v Speaker 1>Thank you Edna Bravo service problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In some sense,</v>

90
00:04:52.751 --> 00:04:55.240
<v Speaker 1>it's these words that audiences </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember,</v>

91
00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.930
<v Speaker 1>especially when the rest of his speech </v>
<v Speaker 1>is incoherent.</v>

92
00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.720
<v Speaker 1>Like the best salesman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump keeps it simple.</v>

93
00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.420
<v Speaker 1>He repeats a lot and we have a real </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

94
00:05:04.421 --> 00:05:06.610
<v Speaker 1>What is the problem?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do have a problem.</v>

95
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:07.473
<v Speaker 1>We have to get down to the problem and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he uses his favorite words over and </v>

96
00:05:10.331 --> 00:05:11.500
<v Speaker 1>over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tremendous,</v>

97
00:05:11.501 --> 00:05:13.960
<v Speaker 1>tremendous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tremendous service,</v>

98
00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.823
<v Speaker 1>and he always seems to have friends who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are part of the group that he's </v>

99
00:05:17.021 --> 00:05:17.854
<v Speaker 1>currently insulting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Calling him up and thanking him for the </v>

100
00:05:19.931 --> 00:05:21.910
<v Speaker 1>privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many of them called me and they said,</v>

101
00:05:21.911 --> 00:05:22.451
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald,</v>

102
00:05:22.451 --> 00:05:23.650
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a problem.</v>

103
00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.000
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a problem.</v>

104
00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.890
<v Speaker 1>Donald trump knows when to sound </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredulous or forceful.</v>

105
00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.100
<v Speaker 1>He has good comedic instinct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could even call him woody,</v>

106
00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.820
<v Speaker 1>but you can't call him smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are well informed.</v>

107
00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:38.193
<v Speaker 1>The best salesman could sell you a TV </v>
<v Speaker 1>without knowing anything about it </v>

108
00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:46.630
<v Speaker 1>because the TV isn't what matters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What matters is you,</v>

109
00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:48.003
<v Speaker 1>and if you are an American citizen who </v>
<v Speaker 1>for years has listened to politicians </v>

110
00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.870
<v Speaker 1>sound sophisticated while accomplishing </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing,</v>

111
00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:01.350
<v Speaker 1>you might just be primed for something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is everything they are not,</v>

112
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:06.200
<v Speaker 1>but the next time you feel like Donald </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump has a point,</v>

113
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:10.190
<v Speaker 1>do yourself a favor and look at his </v>
<v Speaker 1>words.</v>

114
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:13.730
<v Speaker 1>Hey everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for watching.</v>

115
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:17.150
<v Speaker 1>I want to point you in the direction of </v>
<v Speaker 1>my friends over at wisecrack who do some</v>

116
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.280
<v Speaker 1>awesome work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some awesome video essays.</v>
