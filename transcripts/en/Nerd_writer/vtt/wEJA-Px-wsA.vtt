1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.640
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2
00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.280
<v Speaker 2>copy on a Tuesday and blog 10.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We made it.</v>

3
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:14.781
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody.</v>

4
00:00:14.781 --> 00:00:15.614
<v Speaker 1>Let's play.</v>

5
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.390
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck is going on in Europe </v>
<v Speaker 2>tonight?</v>

6
00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:27.820
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so sovereign debt,</v>

7
00:00:27.821 --> 00:00:28.654
<v Speaker 2>also known as government debt is money </v>
<v Speaker 2>or credit owed by a central government </v>

8
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.690
<v Speaker 2>issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also known as security.</v>

9
00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.030
<v Speaker 2>Basically it's like me hitting you a </v>
<v Speaker 2>piece of paper and saying,</v>

10
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.893
<v Speaker 2>I want to borrow $1,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>for you and I'll pay it back in two </v>

11
00:00:39.761 --> 00:00:41.590
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's take a look at you.</v>

12
00:00:41.591 --> 00:00:42.700
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well dressed,</v>

13
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.740
<v Speaker 2>well spoken,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good looking.</v>

14
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.290
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll do it.</v>

15
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.140
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you a million dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but only if you pay me back a little bit</v>

16
00:00:49.141 --> 00:00:51.180
<v Speaker 2>extra in return,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I thought we were friends.</v>

17
00:00:51.181 --> 00:00:53.190
<v Speaker 2>There are no friends in finance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but okay.</v>

18
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.113
<v Speaker 2>How much do you want?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want my million back plus three </v>

19
00:00:55.951 --> 00:00:56.920
<v Speaker 2>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A little bit about.</v>

20
00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.610
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where do I sign right here?</v>

21
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.473
<v Speaker 2>Governments do the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They issue sovereign bonds and accrue </v>

22
00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:04.083
<v Speaker 2>sovereign debt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Such bonds are usually referred to as </v>

23
00:01:05.521 --> 00:01:07.680
<v Speaker 2>risk free bonds because if the </v>
<v Speaker 2>government can pay,</v>

24
00:01:07.681 --> 00:01:09.690
<v Speaker 2>all they have to do is raise taxes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>print more money.</v>

25
00:01:09.691 --> 00:01:10.524
<v Speaker 2>Ice Cream,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because governments never ever default </v>

26
00:01:11.551 --> 00:01:12.384
<v Speaker 2>on their debt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's practically unheard of that a </v>

27
00:01:13.051 --> 00:01:13.861
<v Speaker 2>government could ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever,</v>

28
00:01:13.861 --> 00:01:14.790
<v Speaker 2>ever get close to</v>

29
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:18.200
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hold on,</v>

30
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.360
<v Speaker 2>I'll get to you first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's wind back the clocks.</v>

31
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.350
<v Speaker 2>On February seventh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>19,</v>

32
00:01:24.351 --> 00:01:25.184
<v Speaker 2>92 presidents and prime ministers from </v>
<v Speaker 2>12 different European countries </v>

33
00:01:27.591 --> 00:01:30.140
<v Speaker 2>assembled mess to read Netherlands </v>
<v Speaker 2>design the mess.</v>

34
00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:32.583
<v Speaker 2>It was the document that led to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>creation of the European Union and the </v>

35
00:01:35.181 --> 00:01:37.460
<v Speaker 2>implementation of a single currency </v>
<v Speaker 2>called the.</v>

36
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.330
<v Speaker 2>To join the EU countries needed to meet </v>
<v Speaker 2>strict criteria like no budget.</v>

37
00:01:41.331 --> 00:01:43.340
<v Speaker 2>Deficits of more than three percent of </v>
<v Speaker 2>GDP.</v>

38
00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:44.403
<v Speaker 2>Debt ratios of more than 60 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 2>GDP and interest rates on sovereign </v>

39
00:01:47.031 --> 00:01:49.600
<v Speaker 2>bonds had to stay within two percent of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the EU effort.</v>

40
00:01:49.601 --> 00:01:52.580
<v Speaker 2>Remember those numbers on January first </v>
<v Speaker 2>1999,</v>

41
00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.590
<v Speaker 2>the euro was introduced in nonphysical </v>
<v Speaker 2>form.</v>

42
00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:55.453
<v Speaker 2>Individual currencies like the German </v>
<v Speaker 2>mark or the Greek drama were locked at </v>

43
00:01:58.131 --> 00:01:58.964
<v Speaker 2>fixed rates against each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making that insignificant subdivisions </v>

44
00:02:01.371 --> 00:02:03.410
<v Speaker 2>of the Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had to get rid of three years later</v>

45
00:02:03.411 --> 00:02:04.244
<v Speaker 2>in 2002,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the notes and coins of the yard were </v>

46
00:02:05.661 --> 00:02:08.030
<v Speaker 2>printed and distributed and countries </v>
<v Speaker 2>started.</v>

47
00:02:08.031 --> 00:02:10.340
<v Speaker 2>The process of exchanging all their </v>
<v Speaker 2>money for you,</v>

48
00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.750
<v Speaker 2>why did they do it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why was the euro create?</v>

49
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:13.131
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see,</v>

50
00:02:13.131 --> 00:02:13.964
<v Speaker 2>most of the trade in Europe is among its</v>
<v Speaker 2>own country by removing exchange rate </v>

51
00:02:16.671 --> 00:02:18.290
<v Speaker 2>risks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cutting the cost of transactions,</v>

52
00:02:18.291 --> 00:02:20.840
<v Speaker 2>encouraging firms to trade across </v>
<v Speaker 2>international borders.</v>

53
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.420
<v Speaker 2>The euro made the euro zone into an area</v>
<v Speaker 2>of monetary stability.</v>

54
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.380
<v Speaker 2>Data euro is the second most traded </v>
<v Speaker 2>currency in the world</v>

55
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:29.690
<v Speaker 1>behind the dollar.</v>

56
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.033
<v Speaker 2>Through renewed cooperation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Europe sought not only to ensure </v>

57
00:02:34.781 --> 00:02:35.614
<v Speaker 2>economic stability,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the international peace and peace </v>

58
00:02:37.841 --> 00:02:38.674
<v Speaker 2>they got,</v>

59
00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.100
<v Speaker 3>but ha ha,</v>

60
00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.310
<v Speaker 2>I thought my jokes were bad in Greece </v>
<v Speaker 2>where civilization itself was born,</v>

61
00:02:51.311 --> 00:02:52.144
<v Speaker 2>things had been going awry for quite </v>
<v Speaker 2>some time after the switch to the euro </v>

62
00:02:54.941 --> 00:02:57.100
<v Speaker 2>that traditionally strong Greek public </v>
<v Speaker 2>sector,</v>

63
00:02:57.101 --> 00:02:57.934
<v Speaker 2>so wages rise to outstanding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not to mention that the retirement age </v>

64
00:03:00.821 --> 00:03:03.550
<v Speaker 2>in Greece was very low and its benefits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very generous.</v>

65
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.090
<v Speaker 2>These things aren't enough to sink a </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole country.</v>

66
00:03:06.091 --> 00:03:08.470
<v Speaker 2>It was ultimately tax evasion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which did</v>

67
00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:09.563
<v Speaker 4>the coastal suburb of Kubota.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He is home to Athens elite an apartment </v>

68
00:03:12.971 --> 00:03:14.800
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It costs more than a million euros,</v>

69
00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.800
<v Speaker 4>but despite the obvious signs of wealth </v>
<v Speaker 4>efficiently,</v>

70
00:03:17.801 --> 00:03:18.634
<v Speaker 4>only 16,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>Greeks declared an income of more than </v>

71
00:03:21.461 --> 00:03:24.610
<v Speaker 4>100,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>euros on their taxes last year</v>

72
00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.880
<v Speaker 2>when people in businesses don't pay </v>
<v Speaker 2>their taxes.</v>

73
00:03:26.881 --> 00:03:29.190
<v Speaker 2>It limits revenue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the country takes.</v>

74
00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:30.153
<v Speaker 2>When the money ran out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>atkins turned to other European banks </v>

75
00:03:32.281 --> 00:03:33.114
<v Speaker 2>for loans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Soon they owed billions of euro and the </v>

76
00:03:34.261 --> 00:03:35.094
<v Speaker 2>debt kept going up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but how to grease acquire so much debt </v>

77
00:03:36.781 --> 00:03:38.400
<v Speaker 2>when the guidelines of the European </v>
<v Speaker 2>Union,</v>

78
00:03:38.401 --> 00:03:40.170
<v Speaker 2>we're supposed to keep decks reigned in.</v>

79
00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.420
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to make this pencil </v>
<v Speaker 5>disappeared.</v>

80
00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.960
<v Speaker 5>It's hits</v>

81
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.433
<v Speaker 2>in 2010.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was discovered that Greece had paid </v>

82
00:03:54.001 --> 00:03:54.834
<v Speaker 2>banks like Goldman Sachs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of millions of euro and fees </v>

83
00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.900
<v Speaker 2>for arranging transactions that would </v>
<v Speaker 2>hide the actual level of borrowing.</v>

84
00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.240
<v Speaker 2>This allowed them to keep spending it </v>
<v Speaker 2>accrue more debt.</v>

85
00:04:03.241 --> 00:04:06.090
<v Speaker 2>Upon the inauguration of George Peppard </v>
<v Speaker 2>dre in 2009,</v>

86
00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.953
<v Speaker 2>the Greek government revealed that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>finances were far worse than anyone </v>

87
00:04:10.051 --> 00:04:10.884
<v Speaker 2>expects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their budget deficit was 12 point seven </v>

88
00:04:12.481 --> 00:04:13.314
<v Speaker 2>percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four times more than the euro zone's </v>

89
00:04:14.671 --> 00:04:15.504
<v Speaker 2>limit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The public debt was estimated at $329 </v>

90
00:04:17.541 --> 00:04:22.230
<v Speaker 2>billion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>144 percent of GDP and April of 2010.</v>

91
00:04:22.231 --> 00:04:23.064
<v Speaker 2>Standard and Poor's decreased Greece's </v>
<v Speaker 2>debt rating to the upper levels of junk </v>

92
00:04:26.671 --> 00:04:28.230
<v Speaker 2>status.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Junk Status Bitch.</v>

93
00:04:28.231 --> 00:04:30.330
<v Speaker 2>Take a look at what happened to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>interest rates.</v>

94
00:04:30.331 --> 00:04:32.910
<v Speaker 2>Have two year box.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

95
00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.400
<v Speaker 2>Let's go back to that earlier </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation,</v>

96
00:04:35.401 --> 00:04:36.234
<v Speaker 2>but I thought we were friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are no friends and finding well </v>

97
00:04:38.401 --> 00:04:40.610
<v Speaker 2>with the EU.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not exactly the case.</v>

98
00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:41.483
<v Speaker 2>By adopting the euro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the countries involved basically agreed </v>

99
00:04:43.201 --> 00:04:44.034
<v Speaker 2>that they would all be economic friend </v>
<v Speaker 2>and when the drunken indulgent little </v>

100
00:04:46.561 --> 00:04:48.990
<v Speaker 2>brother passes out in the gutter in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong part of town,</v>

101
00:04:48.991 --> 00:04:49.824
<v Speaker 2>they're responsible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Older brother has to see that he gets </v>

102
00:04:51.751 --> 00:04:52.584
<v Speaker 2>home safe in times of economic emergency</v>
<v Speaker 2>countries can usually just print more </v>

103
00:04:54.961 --> 00:04:55.794
<v Speaker 2>money and accept the inflation and </v>
<v Speaker 2>devalued currency that comes along with </v>

104
00:04:58.561 --> 00:04:59.394
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the countries in the EU gave up the </v>

105
00:05:00.691 --> 00:05:01.524
<v Speaker 2>right to print their own money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so now they have to depend on one and </v>

106
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.360
<v Speaker 2>agrees is a relatively small country in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the scheme of things.</v>

107
00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:09.360
<v Speaker 2>A little economy compared to German,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when Greece owes money,</v>

108
00:05:09.361 --> 00:05:10.960
<v Speaker 2>a campaign to Portugal and Portugal owes</v>
<v Speaker 2>money,</v>

109
00:05:10.961 --> 00:05:13.080
<v Speaker 2>you can't pay to Spain and Spain was </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you can't pay to Germany,</v>

110
00:05:13.081 --> 00:05:15.780
<v Speaker 2>then a problem arise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the domino effect.</v>

111
00:05:15.781 --> 00:05:16.614
<v Speaker 2>People fear it ripples through the EU </v>
<v Speaker 2>that can hurt comparatively stable </v>

112
00:05:19.441 --> 00:05:22.740
<v Speaker 2>countries like France and Germany and </v>
<v Speaker 2>even the United States,</v>

113
00:05:22.741 --> 00:05:24.960
<v Speaker 2>so Greece needs help to save the euro.</v>

114
00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:25.793
<v Speaker 2>The other countries have ultimately </v>
<v Speaker 2>decided to bail out Greece on fifty </v>

115
00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.750
<v Speaker 2>cents of every dollar that it owes way </v>
<v Speaker 2>to soothe.</v>

116
00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.320
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't cheap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You oughta know you bought it.</v>

117
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.100
<v Speaker 2>This in exchange for internal reform in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way of harsh austerity measures,</v>

118
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.890
<v Speaker 2>no more early retirement,</v>

<v Speaker 2>debt.</v>

121
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.540
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people in Greece think the </v>
<v Speaker 2>austerity measures are too harsh,</v>

122
00:05:48.541 --> 00:05:51.720
<v Speaker 2>and so they've incited protests which </v>
<v Speaker 2>continue to this day.</v>

123
00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:52.653
<v Speaker 2>The problem with the European debt </v>
<v Speaker 2>crisis is that Greece isn't the only </v>

124
00:05:55.741 --> 00:05:57.980
<v Speaker 2>country in trouble.</v>

<v Speaker 6>each.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Correct who to mainly France,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Britain and Germany.</v>

129
00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:10.280
<v Speaker 6>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And how Germany,</v>

130
00:06:10.281 --> 00:06:11.510
<v Speaker 6>France,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and Britain going,</v>

131
00:06:11.511 --> 00:06:14.360
<v Speaker 6>Roger will and struggling a bit of a.</v>
<v Speaker 6>correct.</v>

132
00:06:14.361 --> 00:06:15.194
<v Speaker 6>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because they've been told these vast </v>

133
00:06:17.451 --> 00:06:18.284
<v Speaker 6>amounts of money to other European </v>
<v Speaker 6>economies that can't possibly pay them </v>

134
00:06:20.241 --> 00:06:21.170
<v Speaker 6>back.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Correct.</v>

135
00:06:21.171 --> 00:06:24.230
<v Speaker 6>So what are they going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're going to have to bail them out.</v>

136
00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:25.483
<v Speaker 6>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Where are they getting the money to do </v>

137
00:06:26.391 --> 00:06:28.590
<v Speaker 6>that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Roger is a good question.</v>

138

141
00:06:35.961 --> 00:06:36.400
<v Speaker 6>Roger.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So</v>

142
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:40.090
<v Speaker 2>what is the longterm solution?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of the bailout money is coming from</v>

143
00:06:40.091 --> 00:06:42.420
<v Speaker 2>the European financial stability </v>
<v Speaker 2>facilities.</v>

<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some had suggested that the weak </v>

146
00:06:48.431 --> 00:06:52.030
<v Speaker 2>countries lead the euro's to others,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the eurozone should be dismantled,</v>

147
00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:53.260
<v Speaker 2>complete,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever the solution,</v>

148
00:06:53.261 --> 00:06:54.790
<v Speaker 2>whatever money's going to be put on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>table,</v>

149
00:06:54.791 --> 00:06:55.624
<v Speaker 2>it's all going to be conditional on </v>
<v Speaker 2>serious structural reform within the </v>

150
00:06:58.271 --> 00:06:59.104
<v Speaker 2>euro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You hate to see a few bad seeds ruined </v>

<v Speaker 2>the party for everything.</v>

152
00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:02.303
