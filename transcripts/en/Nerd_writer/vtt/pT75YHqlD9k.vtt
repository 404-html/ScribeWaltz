1
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.330
<v Speaker 1>Big Movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>genres have life cycles,</v>

2
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.550
<v Speaker 1>they're born,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they become popular,</v>

3
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.210
<v Speaker 1>they exhaust themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then if they're important enough,</v>

4
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.520
<v Speaker 1>they transform.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hugh Jackman,</v>

5
00:00:23.521 --> 00:00:28.521
<v Speaker 1>17 year tenure as wolverine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think bookends to important milestones</v>

6
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:29.453
<v Speaker 1>in the superhero film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sean to thousands x men directed by </v>

7
00:00:31.981 --> 00:00:32.814
<v Speaker 1>Brian Singer was effectively the start </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the superhero craze that's come to </v>

8
00:00:36.151 --> 00:00:36.984
<v Speaker 1>dominate Hollywood for nearly two </v>
<v Speaker 1>decades and now 2017 slogan directed by </v>

9
00:00:41.011 --> 00:00:45.270
<v Speaker 1>James Mangled represents a response to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the public's exhaustion.</v>

10
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:46.163
<v Speaker 1>Would that dominance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to understand how genres </v>

11
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:49.733
<v Speaker 1>change the writer to look at is </v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely John Qlt who's famous essay </v>

12
00:00:53.431 --> 00:00:54.264
<v Speaker 1>on generic transformation is I think a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good rubric for what's happening in </v>

13
00:00:56.911 --> 00:00:57.744
<v Speaker 1>Logan go wealthy is basically interested</v>
<v Speaker 1>in what occurs when genre conventions </v>

14
00:01:00.961 --> 00:01:05.100
<v Speaker 1>become so well known that the audience </v>
<v Speaker 1>demands something new.</v>

15
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:07.650
<v Speaker 1>What forms does that change?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take a look,</v>

16
00:01:07.651 --> 00:01:11.610
<v Speaker 1>wealthy identifies for burlesque </v>
<v Speaker 1>nostalgia,</v>

17
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.460
<v Speaker 1>demythologize nation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and reaffirmation.</v>

18
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:15.653
<v Speaker 1>Burlesque is essentially a ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 1>exaggeration or a parody of genre </v>

19
00:01:18.751 --> 00:01:21.120
<v Speaker 1>conventions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To Finish Leo [inaudible] quote from the</v>

20
00:01:21.121 --> 00:01:23.760
<v Speaker 1>start of this video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>genres turned to self parody to say,</v>

21
00:01:23.761 --> 00:01:24.594
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least if we can make fun of it for </v>

22
00:01:26.041 --> 00:01:28.440
<v Speaker 1>being infant tile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that will show how far we've come.</v>

23
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.460
<v Speaker 1>Mel Brooks is of course a master at this</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of thing and not just for Westerns.</v>

24
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.353
<v Speaker 1>Moments of burlesque can be found in </v>
<v Speaker 1>serious movies too when a trope is made </v>

25
00:01:36.361 --> 00:01:37.194
<v Speaker 1>to suddenly look ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>undercutting the fantasy with reality </v>

26
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.833
<v Speaker 1>and the superhero genre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Deadpool film that helped pave the way </v>

27
00:01:43.171 --> 00:01:46.020
<v Speaker 1>for logan is a burlesque through and </v>
<v Speaker 1>through</v>

28
00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.863
<v Speaker 2>superhero landing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're going to do a superhero </v>

29
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.150
<v Speaker 2>ladder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You wait for it.</v>

30
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.760
<v Speaker 2>Superhero landing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

31
00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.040
<v Speaker 2>that's really hard on your knees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>totally impractical.</v>

32
00:01:58.041 --> 00:01:58.874
<v Speaker 2>They all do it.</v>

33
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.380
<v Speaker 1>Nostalgic films,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones that are good anyway,</v>

34
00:02:01.381 --> 00:02:04.020
<v Speaker 1>do more than evoke a romanticized </v>
<v Speaker 1>passed.</v>

35
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.123
<v Speaker 1>They update,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tried and true storylines with </v>

36
00:02:06.721 --> 00:02:07.554
<v Speaker 1>contemporary elements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They make the audience aware of the </v>

37
00:02:09.691 --> 00:02:13.350
<v Speaker 1>relationship between past and present </v>
<v Speaker 1>qlt sites,</v>

38
00:02:13.351 --> 00:02:15.090
<v Speaker 1>true grit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Shane Blacks Kiss,</v>

39
00:02:15.091 --> 00:02:15.750
<v Speaker 1>kiss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>

40
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:16.710
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fits the bill as well.</v>

41
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.420
<v Speaker 1>A hard boiled detective story in which </v>
<v Speaker 1>many of the tropes are d romanticized,</v>

42
00:02:21.421 --> 00:02:25.650
<v Speaker 1>but the story ultimately follows the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same beats of discovery and heroism.</v>

43
00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.610
<v Speaker 1>Hold on demythologize films,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the most complex of the bunch.</v>

44
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.473
<v Speaker 1>They subject popular myths and </v>
<v Speaker 1>conventions to a reality that undercuts </v>

45
00:02:33.961 --> 00:02:36.980
<v Speaker 1>and exposes them as inadequate or even </v>
<v Speaker 1>harmful weld.</v>

46
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.310
<v Speaker 1>These archetypal example of this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>Roman Polanski,</v>

47
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.193
<v Speaker 1>Chinatown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a film that follows the hard boiled </v>

48
00:02:41.821 --> 00:02:45.480
<v Speaker 1>detective genre of classic films like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Maltese Falcon or the big sleep.</v>

49
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.840
<v Speaker 1>Until events become so dark and twisted </v>
<v Speaker 1>and devoid of moral content that justice</v>

50
00:02:50.851 --> 00:02:51.840
<v Speaker 1>has never served in.</v>

51
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.540
<v Speaker 1>The detective is left severely </v>
<v Speaker 1>traumatized,</v>

52
00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.940
<v Speaker 1>and another movie like this would be the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cohen brothers.</v>

53
00:02:56.941 --> 00:03:00.130
<v Speaker 1>No country for old men in which the law </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the new West,</v>

54
00:03:00.131 --> 00:03:03.160
<v Speaker 1>Tommy Lee Jones not only fails to </v>
<v Speaker 1>capture the villain,</v>

55
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.353
<v Speaker 1>but fails to understand him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to post bond chips for and </v>

56
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.950
<v Speaker 1>go out and meet something I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>

57
00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.330
<v Speaker 1>The final transformation is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reaffirmation of myth,</v>

58
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.900
<v Speaker 1>that kind of film that subverts genre </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the Dean mythologize film,</v>

59
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.340
<v Speaker 1>but in the end chooses to reaffirm the </v>
<v Speaker 1>myth not as something that's real,</v>

60
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.860
<v Speaker 1>but it's something that we need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe.</v>

61
00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.980
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if you could think of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>superhero film that might fall into that</v>

62
00:03:29.981 --> 00:03:33.580
<v Speaker 1>category,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what is Logan?</v>

63
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.660
<v Speaker 1>Clearly it represents some shift in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily popular genre.</v>

64
00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:38.643
<v Speaker 1>If deadpool signals a self awareness </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the myth of the superhero movie is </v>

65
00:03:41.681 --> 00:03:42.514
<v Speaker 1>losing a bit of it's power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I think Logan is an attempt to </v>

66
00:03:44.681 --> 00:03:45.514
<v Speaker 1>interrogate the contours of that myth in</v>
<v Speaker 1>order to see if there are any </v>

67
00:03:47.951 --> 00:03:50.320
<v Speaker 1>interesting directions left for it to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>

68
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:51.333
<v Speaker 1>Director James Mangold is a movie buff </v>
<v Speaker 1>and something that's really interesting </v>

69
00:03:53.771 --> 00:03:58.771
<v Speaker 1>about logan is how he uses one genre to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand another mangled states.</v>

70
00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.500
<v Speaker 1>Logan's key theme via a scene from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Shane,</v>

71
00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.800
<v Speaker 1>one of the most popular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it claimed Westerns of all time.</v>

72
00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.030
<v Speaker 1>Matt has to be what it is.</v>

73
00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.570
<v Speaker 3>Kept breaking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tried it.</v>

74
00:04:11.571 --> 00:04:16.571
<v Speaker 3>It didn't work for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joy,</v>

75
00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:23.160
<v Speaker 3>there's no living with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no going back.</v>

76
00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.480
<v Speaker 1>Westerns are really the perfect genre to</v>
<v Speaker 1>measure the superhero movie.</v>

77
00:04:27.481 --> 00:04:28.314
<v Speaker 1>The Myth of the superhero is in many </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways a reincarnation of the myth of the </v>

78
00:04:31.621 --> 00:04:32.454
<v Speaker 1>gunslinger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both are heroes who act outside the law </v>

79
00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:35.483
<v Speaker 1>to protect the community at large,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mangled makes these parallels explicit </v>

80
00:04:38.611 --> 00:04:41.100
<v Speaker 1>in a sequence midway through the movie </v>
<v Speaker 1>when Logan,</v>

81
00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.963
<v Speaker 1>Charles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Laura are taken in by a kindly </v>

82
00:04:43.831 --> 00:04:47.010
<v Speaker 1>family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same way that Shane is taken in both</v>

83
00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.873
<v Speaker 1>logan and Shane help the family with </v>
<v Speaker 1>work and protect them from greedy </v>

84
00:04:50.881 --> 00:04:51.714
<v Speaker 1>business interests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but those shane is somewhat haunted by </v>

85
00:04:54.331 --> 00:04:55.164
<v Speaker 1>his life is a gunslinger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His purpose and the code of laws he </v>

86
00:04:57.781 --> 00:05:01.050
<v Speaker 1>lives by is still necessary to protect </v>
<v Speaker 1>the community.</v>

87
00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:02.880
<v Speaker 1>In the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In mangolds version,</v>

88
00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:06.720
<v Speaker 1>the violence that follows the hero can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>be contained far from the valley.</v>

89
00:05:06.721 --> 00:05:10.200
<v Speaker 1>Being saved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Logan's kindly family is mercilessly and</v>

90
00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:12.840
<v Speaker 1>utterly destroyed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if the point wasn't clear,</v>

91
00:05:12.841 --> 00:05:15.690
<v Speaker 1>it's by none other than a clone of Logan</v>
<v Speaker 1>himself.</v>

92
00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.690
<v Speaker 1>This is the closest that logan comes to </v>
<v Speaker 1>demythologize.</v>

93
00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:20.093
<v Speaker 1>The whole movie is a meditation on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>violence that all superhero films imply </v>

94
00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:25.253
<v Speaker 1>by earning an r rating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mangled and Jackman get to show a type </v>

95
00:05:27.481 --> 00:05:28.314
<v Speaker 1>of visceral brutality that complicates </v>
<v Speaker 1>the heroics of Logan's past as well as </v>

96
00:05:32.101 --> 00:05:35.880
<v Speaker 1>those of the x men and all superheroes </v>
<v Speaker 1>like it does.</v>

97
00:05:35.881 --> 00:05:40.500
<v Speaker 1>Shane Logan holds up the romanticized </v>
<v Speaker 1>past of previous superhero movies in the</v>

98
00:05:40.501 --> 00:05:42.990
<v Speaker 1>form of comic books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do know they're all bullshit,</v>

99
00:05:42.991 --> 00:05:43.824
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe a quarter of it happened and not </v>

100
00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:46.713
<v Speaker 1>let this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Logan is attempting to expose the </v>

101
00:05:48.541 --> 00:05:49.374
<v Speaker 1>inadequacy of these fantasies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to show that no personal moral </v>

102
00:05:51.901 --> 00:05:54.840
<v Speaker 1>code can wield power without risking </v>
<v Speaker 1>devastation.</v>

103
00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.860
<v Speaker 1>This was made painfully clear in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>character Xavier,</v>

104
00:05:57.861 --> 00:06:01.910
<v Speaker 1>who's aging mind it's implied,</v>
<v Speaker 1>may have unintentionally killed a number</v>

105
00:06:01.911 --> 00:06:02.744
<v Speaker 1>of innocent mutants for Logan himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The past exploits of heroism from the </v>

106
00:06:06.291 --> 00:06:08.670
<v Speaker 1>other movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reemergence as trauma,</v>

107
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:12.320
<v Speaker 1>nightmares,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the touching scene with Laura.</v>

108
00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:15.080
<v Speaker 1>Near the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he even admits to contemplating suicide.</v>

109
00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:16.463
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am</v>

110
00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:25.460
<v Speaker 1>see shooting myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Charles said in the end,</v>

111
00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.280
<v Speaker 1>Logan makes the final turn into </v>
<v Speaker 1>reaffirmation,</v>

112
00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:29.143
<v Speaker 1>one last act of sacrificial heroics that</v>
<v Speaker 1>reaffirms the myth even after exposing </v>

113
00:06:33.321 --> 00:06:35.090
<v Speaker 1>it as inadequate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

114
00:06:35.091 --> 00:06:38.390
<v Speaker 1>it makes me wonder if this is the limit </v>
<v Speaker 1>of superhero movies.</v>

115
00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:39.493
<v Speaker 1>It's unclear whether a film that sought </v>
<v Speaker 1>to fully demythologize this myth could </v>

116
00:06:42.261 --> 00:06:43.094
<v Speaker 1>ever really get made or if the genre </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself is even mature enough to handle </v>

117
00:06:46.611 --> 00:06:47.750
<v Speaker 1>such a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

118
00:06:47.751 --> 00:06:51.350
<v Speaker 1>I think Logan leaves us with these exact</v>
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>

119
00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:52.273
<v Speaker 1>The movie itself is a conversation </v>
<v Speaker 1>between nostalgia for the genre and are </v>

120
00:06:55.551 --> 00:06:58.880
<v Speaker 1>increasing frustration with its limits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More than anything,</v>

121
00:06:58.910 --> 00:06:59.743
<v Speaker 1>I'm just excited for what's to come </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's transition periods like </v>

122
00:07:03.081 --> 00:07:05.180
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as qlt might say,</v>

123
00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:07.300
<v Speaker 1>when the really interesting thing.</v>
