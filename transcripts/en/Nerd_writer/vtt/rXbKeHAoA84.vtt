1
00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:02.603
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really get upset about Oscar </v>

2
00:00:05.401 --> 00:00:08.880
<v Speaker 1>snubs anymore because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's the Oscars,</v>

3
00:00:08.881 --> 00:00:09.714
<v Speaker 1>but I was a little sad to hear that Sean</v>
<v Speaker 1>Baker's the Florida project didn't make </v>

4
00:00:13.411 --> 00:00:14.244
<v Speaker 1>the cut for best picture this year </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think when it comes to the </v>

5
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:18.623
<v Speaker 1>Academy Awards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nominations really matter more than </v>

6
00:00:20.581 --> 00:00:21.414
<v Speaker 1>who the eventual winner is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always silly to pick the best </v>

7
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.630
<v Speaker 1>anything when it comes to art,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with the nominations,</v>

8
00:00:27.631 --> 00:00:28.464
<v Speaker 1>at least the 7,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>members of the academy get a chance to </v>

9
00:00:30.661 --> 00:00:34.470
<v Speaker 1>highlight the field of diverse </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformative films.</v>

10
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.750
<v Speaker 1>If the Oscars won't highlight the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Florida project,</v>

11
00:00:39.751 --> 00:00:42.270
<v Speaker 1>then I'm happy to because it's without a</v>
<v Speaker 1>doubt.</v>

12
00:00:42.271 --> 00:00:43.104
<v Speaker 1>One of the best films of 2017 and </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching it for me was one of those </v>

13
00:00:47.251 --> 00:00:51.930
<v Speaker 1>transporting experiences that I only get</v>
<v Speaker 1>a few times a year if at all.</v>

14
00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.370
<v Speaker 1>His story is about a group of kids and </v>
<v Speaker 1>their parents who live in a budget motel</v>

15
00:00:56.371 --> 00:00:57.204
<v Speaker 1>outside of Disney world in Florida,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people who live in this community </v>

16
00:00:59.851 --> 00:01:01.830
<v Speaker 1>are the economic margins.</v>

17
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:02.663
<v Speaker 1>Not quite homeless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not quite able to keep a permanent </v>

18
00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:05.964
<v Speaker 1>roof over their heads either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The struggles of living in this kind of </v>

19
00:01:08.281 --> 00:01:10.530
<v Speaker 1>poverty give the film and undertone of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sadness,</v>

20
00:01:10.531 --> 00:01:11.364
<v Speaker 1>but the genius of the Florida project is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it tells its story from the </v>

21
00:01:14.521 --> 00:01:19.100
<v Speaker 1>perspective of the children who can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>help but see their world as a playgroup.</v>

22
00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.630
<v Speaker 1>Baker is pulling heavily from Hell </v>
<v Speaker 1>roaches,</v>

23
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.030
<v Speaker 1>little rascals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a classic series of comedy,</v>

24
00:01:24.031 --> 00:01:24.864
<v Speaker 1>Short films from the Twenties and </v>
<v Speaker 1>thirties that was groundbreaking in the </v>

25
00:01:27.271 --> 00:01:28.104
<v Speaker 1>way that it showed the kids as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids trying to capture the nuances of </v>

26
00:01:32.461 --> 00:01:33.294
<v Speaker 1>their behavior and energy in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>naturalistic way like the Florida </v>

27
00:01:35.791 --> 00:01:36.624
<v Speaker 1>project.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rascals was set against economic </v>

28
00:01:37.981 --> 00:01:39.360
<v Speaker 1>hardship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Great Depression,</v>

29
00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.970
<v Speaker 1>these kids to work growing up in </v>
<v Speaker 1>poverty,</v>

30
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.833
<v Speaker 1>but the focus was never on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was on the scrappy optimism of </v>

31
00:01:46.381 --> 00:01:47.300
<v Speaker 1>childhood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

32
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.710
<v Speaker 1>the Florida project has deeper ambitions</v>
<v Speaker 1>than rascals,</v>

33
00:01:49.711 --> 00:01:50.544
<v Speaker 1>but that optimism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the brightness of this point of view is </v>

34
00:01:53.461 --> 00:01:54.150
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

35
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.670
<v Speaker 1>It keeps the subject matter from being </v>
<v Speaker 1>too overwhelming.</v>

36
00:01:56.671 --> 00:02:00.060
<v Speaker 1>Something that can shut down our ability</v>
<v Speaker 1>to empathize and sympathize.</v>

37
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.253
<v Speaker 1>Sean Baker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think understand something really </v>

38
00:02:02.581 --> 00:02:03.414
<v Speaker 1>critical about storytelling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we don't absorb things by looking </v>

39
00:02:06.961 --> 00:02:07.794
<v Speaker 1>directly at them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Often we see more clearly through </v>

40
00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.290
<v Speaker 1>indirect means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot that Baker and co writer,</v>

41
00:02:13.291 --> 00:02:14.124
<v Speaker 1>Crispr,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gosh want to say about the hidden </v>

42
00:02:15.091 --> 00:02:15.924
<v Speaker 1>homeless in America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't just come right out and </v>

43
00:02:17.701 --> 00:02:18.534
<v Speaker 1>say it or show it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reality of these troubled lives </v>

44
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.900
<v Speaker 1>exists in the peripheral vision of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>child's Day.</v>

45
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.520
<v Speaker 1>Baker in a cinematographer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alexis,</v>

46
00:02:26.521 --> 00:02:30.630
<v Speaker 1>sob a keep the camera low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Parents are often framed peanut style,</v>

47
00:02:30.631 --> 00:02:33.300
<v Speaker 1>just a bunch of legs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even when the kids aren't around,</v>

48
00:02:33.301 --> 00:02:34.134
<v Speaker 1>they favor low angles so that adults </v>
<v Speaker 1>tower over the frames and through the </v>

49
00:02:37.141 --> 00:02:37.974
<v Speaker 1>course of the film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you remember what it's like to see the </v>

50
00:02:39.931 --> 00:02:41.430
<v Speaker 1>world from such a low ankle.</v>

51
00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:42.473
<v Speaker 1>You remember how big everything seemed </v>
<v Speaker 1>and how much sky there actually is </v>

52
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:50.813
<v Speaker 1>carefully building this perspective pays</v>
<v Speaker 1>off in a scene like this where you have </v>

53
00:02:54.511 --> 00:02:56.850
<v Speaker 1>a key piece of information about these </v>
<v Speaker 1>people's lives,</v>

54
00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.893
<v Speaker 1>which is that they struggle so much to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make their bills that they need the </v>

55
00:02:59.921 --> 00:03:00.754
<v Speaker 1>assistance of a local church.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Food Bank make replace the scene again </v>

56
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.863
<v Speaker 1>from young Mooney's perspective and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to piece together what's really </v>

57
00:03:07.931 --> 00:03:08.764
<v Speaker 1>happening here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't want to show us the food </v>

58
00:03:10.601 --> 00:03:14.230
<v Speaker 1>assistance itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wants to show us how normal something</v>

59
00:03:14.231 --> 00:03:17.470
<v Speaker 1>like that is to Moonee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the devastating thing.</v>

60
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.300
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of the films,</v>

61
00:03:19.301 --> 00:03:22.150
<v Speaker 1>most crushing moments are played from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the perspective of kids.</v>

62
00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.390
<v Speaker 1>When Mooney's mother's starts </v>
<v Speaker 1>prostituting herself to make rent.</v>

63
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.120
<v Speaker 1>This is the way that the Florida project</v>
<v Speaker 1>shows us</v>

64
00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.350
<v Speaker 2>be right back.</v>

65
00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:42.373
<v Speaker 1>This is how the film talks to us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something is always seen through </v>

66
00:03:44.931 --> 00:03:47.360
<v Speaker 1>something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The decaying edge lands outside.</v>

67
00:03:47.361 --> 00:03:48.194
<v Speaker 1>Disneyworld are seen through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>colorful imagination of an adventurous </v>

68
00:03:50.841 --> 00:03:52.820
<v Speaker 1>kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the promise of Disney world,</v>

69
00:03:52.821 --> 00:03:55.400
<v Speaker 1>as seen through the poverty that </v>
<v Speaker 1>surrounds it.</v>

70
00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:56.503
<v Speaker 1>The pain of living without work is seen </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the kindness of neighbors and </v>

71
00:03:59.751 --> 00:04:03.290
<v Speaker 1>strangers and motel managers and Mooney </v>
<v Speaker 1>and her mother,</v>

72
00:04:03.291 --> 00:04:06.140
<v Speaker 1>Haley,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the films two main characters are seeing</v>

73
00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.000
<v Speaker 1>through each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In some ways.</v>

74
00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.060
<v Speaker 1>Haley is a loving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>caring mother and others.</v>

75
00:04:11.061 --> 00:04:13.400
<v Speaker 1>She's a delinquent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>selfish mother.</v>

76
00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:14.323
<v Speaker 1>These are all things that we see and </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn through the way that Mooney acts </v>

77
00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:25.220
<v Speaker 1>in Haley.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We see a Moonie that was child that grew</v>

78
00:04:25.221 --> 00:04:26.054
<v Speaker 1>out of her innocence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we also see a Moonie that might be </v>

79
00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:31.680
<v Speaker 1>this grace.</v>

80
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:35.373
<v Speaker 1>It's in the continuum of these two that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the film finds a way to express trues </v>

81
00:04:39.531 --> 00:04:40.364
<v Speaker 1>that are larger than the movie itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for those living in the margins of late </v>

82
00:04:43.761 --> 00:04:46.940
<v Speaker 1>capitalism tossed around by the wave of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the great recession,</v>

83
00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.950
<v Speaker 1>Moonee and Halley are representative of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a cycle of hardship that can lock itself</v>

84
00:04:51.951 --> 00:04:52.784
<v Speaker 1>into a family tree for decades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mothers like Haley bear some of the </v>

85
00:04:56.301 --> 00:04:57.134
<v Speaker 1>responsibility for the situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we bear some of the responsibility </v>

86
00:05:00.021 --> 00:05:03.840
<v Speaker 1>too because as the film shows us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mothers like Haley,</v>

87
00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.390
<v Speaker 1>really just kids like Mooney and Mooney </v>
<v Speaker 1>is nothing but innocent.</v>

88
00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.280
<v Speaker 1>It's a way of understanding the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual and societal responsibilities</v>

89
00:05:13.281 --> 00:05:14.114
<v Speaker 1>for poverty that only a film can achieve</v>
<v Speaker 1>and only a film with this kind of </v>

90
00:05:17.601 --> 00:05:18.470
<v Speaker 1>discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

91
00:05:18.471 --> 00:05:19.304
<v Speaker 1>this doesn't mean that the Florida </v>
<v Speaker 1>project is trying to Trojan horse a sad </v>

92
00:05:21.831 --> 00:05:25.160
<v Speaker 1>story to the viewer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an incredibly joyous movie.</v>

93
00:05:25.161 --> 00:05:29.630
<v Speaker 1>It's fun to watch like the little </v>
<v Speaker 1>rascals and the particular heartbreak we</v>

94
00:05:29.631 --> 00:05:32.780
<v Speaker 1>feel doesn't end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can't exist without that joy.</v>

95
00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:33.703
<v Speaker 1>Baker couldn't express one without </v>
<v Speaker 1>expressing the other because he </v>

96
00:05:36.681 --> 00:05:39.140
<v Speaker 1>understands that they're part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>

97
00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:40.393
<v Speaker 1>That's the kind of understanding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is the kind of filmmaking </v>

98
00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:46.070
<v Speaker 1>academy members should promote through </v>
<v Speaker 1>their nominations.</v>

99
00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.400
<v Speaker 1>It's a shame they didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I guess I shouldn't mind about snubs</v>

100
00:05:49.401 --> 00:05:52.520
<v Speaker 1>because I mean it's the Oscars.</v>

101
00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:05.660
<v Speaker 1>Hey everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Happy Wednesday.</v>

102
00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:06.583

<v Speaker 1>If you don't know,</v>

104
00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:11.383
<v Speaker 1>verve is a service that pulls together a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of great content channels like </v>

105
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.490
<v Speaker 1>rooster teeth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mondo,</v>

107
00:06:22.131 --> 00:06:22.964
<v Speaker 1>best enemy are definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they've also added a lot of new </v>

108
00:06:25.131 --> 00:06:30.131
<v Speaker 1>channels like movie which hosts are </v>
<v Speaker 1>rotating roster of 30 indie movies,</v>

109
00:06:30.231 --> 00:06:31.064
<v Speaker 1>which is something that I love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One other show that I would personally </v>

110
00:06:33.231 --> 00:06:34.064
<v Speaker 1>like to recommend is the director's </v>
<v Speaker 1>chair where director Robert Rodriguez </v>

111
00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:41.120
<v Speaker 1>interviews other directors like Coppola,</v>
<v Speaker 1>George Miller,</v>

112
00:06:41.121 --> 00:06:43.970
<v Speaker 1>Guillermo del Toro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been looking for somewhere to watch</v>

113
00:06:43.971 --> 00:06:47.720
<v Speaker 1>these episodes for so long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm thrilled that verve has it.</v>

114
00:06:47.721 --> 00:06:50.180
<v Speaker 1>Now you can only watch that with </v>

<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>
