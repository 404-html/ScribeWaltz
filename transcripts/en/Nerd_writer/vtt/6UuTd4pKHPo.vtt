1
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.153
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when the final scene of kill bill </v>

2
00:00:17.331 --> 00:00:18.164
<v Speaker 1>volume two by Quentin Tarantino,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the eponymous villain bill tranquilized </v>

3
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.013
<v Speaker 1>as the hero and the narrative to deliver</v>
<v Speaker 1>a short monologue on his deep affection </v>

4
00:00:25.311 --> 00:00:29.270
<v Speaker 1>for comic book Superheroes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>namely Superman Man of steel,</v>

5
00:00:29.271 --> 00:00:31.580
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stands apart from other heroes like that</v>

6
00:00:31.581 --> 00:00:32.270
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spiderman,</v>

7
00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:33.440
<v Speaker 1>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In that,</v>

8
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.720
<v Speaker 1>unlike those others who have to don the </v>
<v Speaker 1>costume,</v>

9
00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:36.703
<v Speaker 1>that they may become the hero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>superman wakes as superman and must </v>

10
00:00:39.891 --> 00:00:40.724
<v Speaker 1>instead down the costume of clark at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mild mannered reporter from the daily </v>

11
00:00:43.461 --> 00:00:47.420
<v Speaker 1>planet who bill believes is superman's </v>
<v Speaker 1>critique on the human race.</v>

12
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.433
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if tarantino believes this </v>

13
00:00:49.431 --> 00:00:53.090
<v Speaker 1>or it's just build who does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but being a huge fan of superman.</v>

14
00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.920
<v Speaker 1>I have to say that I can't agree with </v>
<v Speaker 1>this characterization of the last son of</v>

15
00:00:57.921 --> 00:00:58.754
<v Speaker 1>crypto.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not too long ago when I didn't have to </v>

16
00:00:59.781 --> 00:01:03.770
<v Speaker 1>pay for rent or utilities or groceries </v>
<v Speaker 1>or car insurance.</v>

17
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.993
<v Speaker 1>I used to read comic books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every wednesday I go to the local comic </v>

18
00:01:07.131 --> 00:01:09.230
<v Speaker 1>book store and pick up new editions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the dc monthly.</v>

19
00:01:09.231 --> 00:01:10.064
<v Speaker 1>It's mainly the for superman titles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which were at that time still running </v>

20
00:01:12.321 --> 00:01:14.210
<v Speaker 1>action comics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>superman,</v>

21
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.490
<v Speaker 1>the adventures of superman and the man </v>
<v Speaker 1>of steel.</v>

22
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.780
<v Speaker 1>I was the only one of my friends who who</v>
<v Speaker 1>read comics regularly and so it was sort</v>

23
00:01:20.781 --> 00:01:21.614
<v Speaker 1>of a thrill going there every wednesday </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it was my first real sense of a </v>

24
00:01:23.991 --> 00:01:26.750
<v Speaker 1>community in which everyone was </v>
<v Speaker 1>connected by their love of something.</v>

25
00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.160
<v Speaker 1>In this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comics,</v>

26
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.040
<v Speaker 1>and I've been a huge fan of communities </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that ever since.</v>

27
00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.030
<v Speaker 1>Hence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

28
00:01:32.031 --> 00:01:32.864
<v Speaker 1>I became fascinated with superman </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably for the same reason that a lot </v>

29
00:01:35.061 --> 00:01:35.894
<v Speaker 1>of young boys do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get lost in that fantasy of </v>

30
00:01:37.791 --> 00:01:38.624
<v Speaker 1>unlimited physical power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>superman could fly and it is an </v>

31
00:01:41.181 --> 00:01:45.620
<v Speaker 1>immutable fact of the universe that </v>
<v Speaker 1>every boy everywhere knows exactly which</v>

32
00:01:45.621 --> 00:01:46.454
<v Speaker 1>combination of muscles to clench in </v>
<v Speaker 1>order to take off into the sky or shoot </v>

33
00:01:49.761 --> 00:01:51.800
<v Speaker 1>fire from your eyes or see through </v>
<v Speaker 1>walls.</v>

34
00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.990
<v Speaker 1>Superman could do all those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could fly at.</v>

35
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.360
<v Speaker 1>Super speed here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cries for help at great distances.</v>

36
00:01:56.361 --> 00:02:01.100
<v Speaker 1>He could pick up cars and hurl them like</v>
<v Speaker 1>baseballs and how cruel where the stupid</v>

37
00:02:01.101 --> 00:02:01.934
<v Speaker 1>stupid laws of physics for preventing </v>
<v Speaker 1>all this regular humans from doing such </v>

38
00:02:05.271 --> 00:02:06.104
<v Speaker 1>things when it's so easy to imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that those fantasies ever </v>

39
00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:11.060
<v Speaker 1>leave us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as I grew older,</v>

40
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.330
<v Speaker 1>the story of superman began to captivate</v>
<v Speaker 1>me for different reasons.</v>

41
00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.253
<v Speaker 1>I think when we're young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we feel that to achieve those feats of </v>

42
00:02:17.151 --> 00:02:18.800
<v Speaker 1>strength would solve a lot of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>

43
00:02:18.801 --> 00:02:21.560
<v Speaker 1>If I could only fly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I can be the one who flies,</v>

44
00:02:21.561 --> 00:02:24.830
<v Speaker 1>then I could be special and important </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all those abstract things.</v>

45
00:02:24.831 --> 00:02:26.420
<v Speaker 1>But as we make our way through </v>
<v Speaker 1>adolescence,</v>

46
00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.470
<v Speaker 1>the complexities of the inner life begin</v>
<v Speaker 1>to muddy those waters.</v>

47
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.810
<v Speaker 1>The pen with which you have to write </v>
<v Speaker 1>your own identity,</v>

48
00:02:32.811 --> 00:02:33.644
<v Speaker 1>gets put into your hand and you realize </v>
<v Speaker 1>that no feat of strength or speed will </v>

49
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.070
<v Speaker 1>help you with that task or superman.</v>

50
00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.020
<v Speaker 1>The tasks would be even more difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His strength,</v>

51
00:02:42.021 --> 00:02:43.700
<v Speaker 1>his speed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his ability to fly,</v>

52
00:02:43.701 --> 00:02:44.534
<v Speaker 1>serve only to neutralize the physical so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the intellectual and emotional </v>

53
00:02:47.961 --> 00:02:49.940
<v Speaker 1>problems that plague all of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to love,</v>

54
00:02:49.941 --> 00:02:51.920
<v Speaker 1>how to be loved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to know who we are,</v>

55
00:02:51.921 --> 00:02:53.540
<v Speaker 1>what we should want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how we should act,</v>

56
00:02:53.541 --> 00:02:56.210
<v Speaker 1>why we're here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>appear only in starker relief.</v>

57
00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.310
<v Speaker 1>All his incredible power becomes an </v>
<v Speaker 1>equally helplessness.</v>

58
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.173
<v Speaker 1>Clark can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't wake up fried from these things </v>

59
00:03:02.861 --> 00:03:03.694
<v Speaker 1>just as neither you nor I can ignore the</v>
<v Speaker 1>personal and ethical dilemmas that </v>

60
00:03:06.851 --> 00:03:09.370
<v Speaker 1>define us and it's ironic that in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>comics,</v>

61
00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:10.483
<v Speaker 1>his feelings of being an alien from </v>
<v Speaker 1>another planet of not fitting in or the </v>

62
00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:13.984
<v Speaker 1>cause of so much sorrow because it has </v>
<v Speaker 1>these same feelings of sorrow for not </v>

63
00:03:17.171 --> 00:03:18.340
<v Speaker 1>fitting in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for not belonging,</v>

64
00:03:18.341 --> 00:03:22.060
<v Speaker 1>that make the rest of us human.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clark kent is clark kent.</v>

65
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.240
<v Speaker 1>He puts on the costume to become </v>
<v Speaker 1>superman and his as godly and perfect as</v>

66
00:03:27.311 --> 00:03:29.170
<v Speaker 1>we would have others believe that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

67
00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.350
<v Speaker 1>He saves the world from extraterrestrial</v>
<v Speaker 1>existential threats,</v>

68
00:03:32.351 --> 00:03:34.840
<v Speaker 1>from villains of every shape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>size and hairstyle.</v>

69
00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.780
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is as impotent as the rest of us when</v>

70
00:03:37.781 --> 00:03:38.614
<v Speaker 1>it comes to saving himself from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bumbling stuttering forever struggling </v>

71
00:03:41.711 --> 00:03:42.544
<v Speaker 1>condition of life and maybe clark kent </v>
<v Speaker 1>is clark kent's critique on the human </v>

72
00:03:46.241 --> 00:03:48.370
<v Speaker 1>race,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to say that is simply to say that we</v>

73
00:03:48.371 --> 00:03:51.070
<v Speaker 1>are all continuously critiquing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>human race.</v>

74
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.570
<v Speaker 1>When we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

75
00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:53.553
<v Speaker 1>make total fools of ourselves in front </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the lowest lanes of our lines and as </v>

76
00:03:58.481 --> 00:03:59.314
<v Speaker 1>beautiful as lois seems to clark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know that she herself feels </v>

77
00:04:04.301 --> 00:04:09.301
<v Speaker 1>inadequate and the presence of superman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the great hero who is after all,</v>

78
00:04:09.701 --> 00:04:12.850
<v Speaker 1>only the same clark kent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's invincible knees,</v>

79
00:04:12.851 --> 00:04:16.840
<v Speaker 1>can't seem to keep from going week in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the presence of her kryptonite eyes.</v>

80
00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:18.813
<v Speaker 1>Some critique.</v>
