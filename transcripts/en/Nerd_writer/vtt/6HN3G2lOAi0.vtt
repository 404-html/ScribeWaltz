1
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.360
<v Speaker 1>So in the very first sentence or the New</v>
<v Speaker 1>York Times review of reservoir dogs,</v>

2
00:00:09.361 --> 00:00:12.660
<v Speaker 1>critic Benson camping wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been an unusually good year for the</v>

3
00:00:12.661 --> 00:00:13.494
<v Speaker 1>discovery of first rate new American </v>
<v Speaker 1>film directors then goes on to list for </v>

4
00:00:17.221 --> 00:00:20.280
<v Speaker 1>films that you've never seen by four </v>
<v Speaker 1>directors that you've never heard of,</v>

5
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.000
<v Speaker 1>none of whom lasted more than a decade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making movies before continuing.</v>

6
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.850
<v Speaker 1>Now add to that list the name of Quentin</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tarantino,</v>

7
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.790
<v Speaker 1>I guess one out of five ain't bad.</v>

8
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.133
<v Speaker 1>Twenty five years after that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Review Tarantino was probably the most </v>

9
00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.220
<v Speaker 1>popular living working director in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world after maybe Spielberg and Scorsese</v>

10
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.083
<v Speaker 1>is eight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Films have grossed over one point </v>

11
00:00:44.381 --> 00:00:45.214
<v Speaker 1>$5,000,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>worldwide and writing about his work </v>

12
00:00:47.861 --> 00:00:48.694
<v Speaker 1>could fill a small library.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The quarter century milestone is a good </v>

13
00:00:55.481 --> 00:00:59.170
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to look back at how </v>
<v Speaker 1>Terentino's first film has aged.</v>

14
00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.273
<v Speaker 1>I have a slight obsession with first </v>
<v Speaker 1>with how things begin in the first shot </v>

15
00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.150
<v Speaker 1>of reservoir dogs is probably the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I think about the most.</v>

16
00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.661
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

17
00:01:07.661 --> 00:01:09.580
<v Speaker 1>Obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know this is not technically the first</v>

18
00:01:09.581 --> 00:01:12.550
<v Speaker 1>shot of the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've always sort of viewed the diner</v>

19
00:01:12.551 --> 00:01:13.384
<v Speaker 1>scene that proceeds the opening credits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a kind of overtures Terentino's </v>

20
00:01:16.121 --> 00:01:16.954
<v Speaker 1>entire filmography.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Traditionally overtures are moot </v>

21
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.700
<v Speaker 1>centers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit of music that sets the tone</v>

22
00:01:21.701 --> 00:01:22.534
<v Speaker 1>for what's about to follow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's only natural that in Terentino's </v>

23
00:01:24.821 --> 00:01:25.654
<v Speaker 1>land,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the overture is a seven minute </v>

24
00:01:26.561 --> 00:01:29.650
<v Speaker 1>conversation about Madonna songs and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>merits of tipping,</v>

25
00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.020
<v Speaker 1>but society says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have these guys over here,</v>

26
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.880
<v Speaker 1>but tip these guys over here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's bullshit.</v>

27
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.330
<v Speaker 1>So the first shot of the story proper is</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

28
00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.360
<v Speaker 1>and it's one of the most electrifying </v>
<v Speaker 1>openings in film history,</v>

29
00:01:40.361 --> 00:01:43.240
<v Speaker 1>like the first notes in the first led </v>
<v Speaker 1>Zepplin album.</v>

30
00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.850
<v Speaker 1>Before you have a chance to blink,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're involved,</v>

31
00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.520
<v Speaker 1>your mind fans forward and backward </v>
<v Speaker 1>through time.</v>

32
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.010
<v Speaker 1>It's usual in film for actions to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences,</v>

33
00:01:51.011 --> 00:01:53.290
<v Speaker 1>but here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences have actions,</v>

34
00:01:53.291 --> 00:01:55.920
<v Speaker 1>actions to begin to imagine the heist </v>
<v Speaker 1>gone long</v>

35
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.013
<v Speaker 1>just like you're in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're also in the future calculating </v>

36
00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.270
<v Speaker 1>how long this guy has left to live and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what can be done to save him,</v>

37
00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:10.880
<v Speaker 1>and of course like Mr Orange bleeding </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

38
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.680
<v Speaker 1>You can't escape the present either </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's what pain is a brutal and</v>

39
00:02:15.681 --> 00:02:17.750
<v Speaker 1>specific attention to the present </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>

40
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.123
<v Speaker 1>It's that pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that panicked feeling of time running </v>

41
00:02:20.931 --> 00:02:24.870
<v Speaker 1>out that separates this film from others</v>
<v Speaker 1>that begin in media read.</v>

42
00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.353
<v Speaker 1>Whenever I create anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always hold it up against the opening </v>

43
00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.750
<v Speaker 1>of reservoir dogs is the beginning as </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention capturing as this.</v>

44
00:02:32.751 --> 00:02:36.200
<v Speaker 1>Does it have the same kinetic energy </v>
<v Speaker 1>launching you into the narrative?</v>

45
00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.190
<v Speaker 1>It's here too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

46
00:02:37.191 --> 00:02:40.220
<v Speaker 1>that were introduced to the technique </v>
<v Speaker 1>that made Terentino's famous.</v>

47
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.113
<v Speaker 1>The nonlinear structure of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>storytelling and interviews Terentino's </v>

48
00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.990
<v Speaker 1>compared the Byzantine tracks of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>early films to novel writing.</v>

49
00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.690
<v Speaker 1>Novelists have always had just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>complete freedom.</v>

50
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.240
<v Speaker 1>Pretty much tell their story anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They saw fit.</v>

51
00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:54.553
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's Kinda what I'm kind of what </v>

52
00:02:56.451 --> 00:02:57.284
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but while I think the comparison to </v>

53
00:02:58.581 --> 00:02:59.414
<v Speaker 1>fiction apt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also think that there is a </v>

54
00:03:00.521 --> 00:03:01.354
<v Speaker 1>relationship here again with USAC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I think help </v>

55
00:03:04.391 --> 00:03:05.224
<v Speaker 1>reservoir dogs age so well is </v>
<v Speaker 1>Terentino's instinctive sense for </v>

56
00:03:08.411 --> 00:03:09.730
<v Speaker 1>narrative momentum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>

57
00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:10.564
<v Speaker 1>the ordering of the movie is a lot like </v>
<v Speaker 1>an under examined aspects of popular </v>

58
00:03:13.571 --> 00:03:15.940
<v Speaker 1>music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The sequencing of albums.</v>

59
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.430
<v Speaker 1>One of the reasons I love Abbey road for</v>
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>

60
00:03:18.431 --> 00:03:19.264
<v Speaker 1>one of the reasons I've listened to it </v>
<v Speaker 1>so many times all the way through is </v>

61
00:03:21.341 --> 00:03:22.174
<v Speaker 1>because the song sequence carries me </v>
<v Speaker 1>through even in the first half where </v>

62
00:03:24.641 --> 00:03:27.130
<v Speaker 1>there's no medley.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The arrangement has thrust.</v>

63
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just imagine the change in feeling.</v>

64
00:03:29.561 --> 00:03:32.830
<v Speaker 1>If the album began with say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maxwells silver hammer.</v>

65
00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.710
<v Speaker 1>Now imagine the change and feeling </v>
<v Speaker 1>reservoir dogs began here.</v>

66
00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.980
<v Speaker 1>Sales when motherfuckers Kev is doing a </v>
<v Speaker 1>job and take a big fat guess.</v>

67
00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.853
<v Speaker 1>Once on a team.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The sequencing and reservoir dogs has </v>

68
00:03:53.401 --> 00:03:55.920
<v Speaker 1>the same natural rhythm as an album </v>
<v Speaker 1>cycle does.</v>

69
00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.993
<v Speaker 1>Offering a variety in tempo from intense</v>
<v Speaker 1>too reflective and back while linking </v>

70
00:04:01.411 --> 00:04:02.244
<v Speaker 1>corresponding scenes together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All Terentino's films are constructed </v>

71
00:04:05.161 --> 00:04:06.390
<v Speaker 1>this way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like albums,</v>

72
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:08.400
<v Speaker 1>more like albums.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that novels,</v>

73
00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.850
<v Speaker 1>even the ones with more straightforward </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative</v>

74
00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:14.523
<v Speaker 2>black</v>

75
00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.033
<v Speaker 1>coming up with an idea is to go through </v>
<v Speaker 1>that record room and go through those </v>

76
00:04:22.491 --> 00:04:27.491
<v Speaker 1>records and to kind of find the music or</v>
<v Speaker 1>the personality of a given movie.</v>

77
00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:28.753
<v Speaker 1>It's like I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking for the rhythm that this </v>

78
00:04:30.201 --> 00:04:31.034
<v Speaker 1>movie needs to play and I'm looking for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the spirit and the rhythm that this </v>

79
00:04:33.861 --> 00:04:34.694
<v Speaker 1>movie needs to play it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other thing that Tarantino is most </v>

80
00:04:36.471 --> 00:04:40.430
<v Speaker 1>known for is his dialogue and of course </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the references in reservoir dogs</v>

81
00:04:40.431 --> 00:04:41.780
<v Speaker 1>have an aged so well.</v>

82
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:42.311
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

83
00:04:42.311 --> 00:04:47.311
<v Speaker 2>she looked like she looked like Christie</v>
<v Speaker 2>love TV.</v>

84
00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.953
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody today remembers the show get </v>

85
00:04:59.521 --> 00:05:00.354
<v Speaker 1>Christie love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what's more important here is the </v>

86
00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:04.290
<v Speaker 1>concept.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People still talk about TV shows.</v>

87
00:05:04.291 --> 00:05:05.124
<v Speaker 1>Entertainment is still a common language</v>
<v Speaker 1>between strangers picking genre </v>

88
00:05:08.431 --> 00:05:10.990
<v Speaker 1>characters and genres situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

89
00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:11.963
<v Speaker 1>And giving them a real life spin have </v>
<v Speaker 1>them sound like real people like me and </v>

90
00:05:16.711 --> 00:05:17.544
<v Speaker 1>my friends and just other people and </v>
<v Speaker 1>make references that other people make </v>

91
00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:21.123
<v Speaker 1>of war dogs translates into 2017 because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the humanity and the comedy that </v>

92
00:05:24.331 --> 00:05:28.500
<v Speaker 1>Tarantino breathed into genre films is </v>
<v Speaker 1>still felt all over</v>

93
00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:33.770
<v Speaker 2>footloose and in a great hero named </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kevin Bacon</v>

94
00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:40.640
<v Speaker 1>teaches an entire city full of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>with sticks up their butts that dancing.</v>

95
00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:45.710
<v Speaker 1>So greatest thing there is I think the </v>
<v Speaker 1>only context in which reservoir dogs has</v>

96
00:05:45.711 --> 00:05:46.544
<v Speaker 1>an age so well is within Terentino's own</v>
<v Speaker 1>demography for all the purchase it has </v>

97
00:05:50.631 --> 00:05:52.610
<v Speaker 1>on film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture and popular culture.</v>

98
00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:55.400
<v Speaker 1>It's still very clearly his most amateur</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>

99
00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:56.503
<v Speaker 1>It's impossible to say how would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>received today if it was released </v>

100
00:05:58.821 --> 00:06:02.990
<v Speaker 1>because so much of cinema in the past 25</v>
<v Speaker 1>years is influenced by the style.</v>

101
00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.490
<v Speaker 1>But I think siskel and Ebert got pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>close in their original reviews.</v>

102
00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.970
<v Speaker 1>I liked that movie as far as it went.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted it to go further and try more.</v>

103
00:06:10.971 --> 00:06:12.260
<v Speaker 1>I had the same reaction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roger,</v>

104
00:06:12.261 --> 00:06:16.940
<v Speaker 1>that it was a lot of exercise in style,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then I got that really quick.</v>

105
00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean I understand what he's trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do here,</v>

106
00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:22.430
<v Speaker 1>which is which is to show things in </v>
<v Speaker 1>crime,</v>

107
00:06:22.431 --> 00:06:26.150
<v Speaker 1>movies that crime movies don't show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

108
00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.160
<v Speaker 1>the sloppiness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the humor,</v>

109
00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:31.520
<v Speaker 1>but we get that within 15 minutes.</v>

110
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:32.383
<v Speaker 1>The missing piece to reservoir dogs is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the deeper character studies and </v>

111
00:06:35.151 --> 00:06:39.650
<v Speaker 1>exploration of big ideas that you get in</v>
<v Speaker 1>pulp fiction and Jackie Brown,</v>

112
00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:42.230
<v Speaker 1>inglorious bastards and Django </v>
<v Speaker 1>unchained.</v>

113
00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.393
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do think that there is one point in </v>

114
00:06:45.171 --> 00:06:48.950
<v Speaker 1>reservoir dogs were Tarantino does reach</v>
<v Speaker 1>for something deeper.</v>

115
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:50.473
<v Speaker 1>The commode story sequence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of Tarantino's work comments on the </v>

116
00:06:54.081 --> 00:06:54.914
<v Speaker 1>nature of storytelling itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the part when Mr Orange and </v>

117
00:06:57.591 --> 00:07:02.210
<v Speaker 1>undercover cop learns a fake story to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sell the criminals on his credibility is</v>

118
00:07:02.211 --> 00:07:05.240
<v Speaker 1>one of the best instances of this in all</v>
<v Speaker 1>his movies.</v>

119
00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:08.540
<v Speaker 1>He splits the sequence into four parts </v>
<v Speaker 1>are in learning the scene,</v>

120
00:07:08.541 --> 00:07:10.100
<v Speaker 1>orange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rehearsing the scene,</v>

121
00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:12.470
<v Speaker 1>orange performing the story for an </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience.</v>

122
00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:13.603
<v Speaker 1>Then finally the story coming alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an elegant illustration of how </v>

123
00:07:17.121 --> 00:07:17.954
<v Speaker 1>words can transform into stories and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories into reality or into movies and </v>

124
00:07:23.511 --> 00:07:24.344
<v Speaker 1>it's a nice touch that the only thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that keeps the cops from noticing the </v>

125
00:07:26.511 --> 00:07:27.344
<v Speaker 1>drugs is the similar storytelling </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation because stories can keep us </v>

126
00:07:31.551 --> 00:07:33.020
<v Speaker 1>from seeing reality too.</v>

127
00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:33.983
<v Speaker 2>Buddy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to shoot you in the face if </v>

128
00:07:37.411 --> 00:07:39.450
<v Speaker 2>you don't put your hands on the dash</v>

129
00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:40.433
<v Speaker 1>as an exercise in genre and style.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reservoir dogs is super one of the best </v>

130
00:07:44.461 --> 00:07:48.210
<v Speaker 1>in film and if it falls just short of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the transcendent heights,</v>

131
00:07:48.211 --> 00:07:49.950
<v Speaker 1>that Tarantino would later go on to </v>
<v Speaker 1>reach,</v>

132
00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:53.550
<v Speaker 1>but that's not really a criticism </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I mean,</v>

133
00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:54.563
<v Speaker 1>let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You try to reach just short of </v>

134
00:07:56.221 --> 00:07:57.054
<v Speaker 1>transcendent with your first movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a good rule of thumb for how </v>

135
00:08:00.121 --> 00:08:04.470
<v Speaker 1>well films have aged is simply whether </v>
<v Speaker 1>or not we keep watching them.</v>

136
00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:05.963
<v Speaker 1>Twenty five years on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm still watching reservoir dogs and </v>

137
00:08:09.061 --> 00:08:13.970
<v Speaker 1>I'll bet that it'll still be true 25 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years and more from that.</v>

138
