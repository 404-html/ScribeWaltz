00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:01.523
<v Speaker 1>Mm,</v>

2
00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:04.773
<v Speaker 2>I'm happy to John with you today in road</v>
<v Speaker 2>go down in history as the greatest </v>

3
00:00:15.691 --> 00:00:20.100
<v Speaker 2>demonstration for freedom in the history</v>
<v Speaker 2>of our nation,</v>

4
00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:21.423
<v Speaker 1>Martin Luther King's I have a dream </v>
<v Speaker 1>speech is arguably the most important </v>

5
00:00:24.251 --> 00:00:26.200
<v Speaker 1>and most well known speech of the 20th </v>
<v Speaker 1>century.</v>

6
00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.860
<v Speaker 1>It's 1,667</v>
<v Speaker 1>words in 17 minutes long,</v>

7
00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:30.723
<v Speaker 1>absolutely riddled with big difficult </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms and full of rhetorical devices </v>

8
00:00:34.841 --> 00:00:35.674
<v Speaker 1>that are intentional and practiced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The speech is everyone knows was </v>

9
00:00:38.501 --> 00:00:42.280
<v Speaker 1>delivered at the march on Washington in </v>
<v Speaker 1>1963 and voiced the economic,</v>

10
00:00:42.281 --> 00:00:43.114
<v Speaker 1>political and moral message of civil </v>
<v Speaker 1>rights to a quarter million people in </v>

11
00:00:46.931 --> 00:00:51.040
<v Speaker 1>front of the Lincoln memorial onto those</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and the billions who have seen or</v>

12
00:00:51.041 --> 00:00:51.874
<v Speaker 1>heard it since king's words in printed </v>
<v Speaker 1>an image of what black Americans were </v>

13
00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:57.453
<v Speaker 1>fighting for and why fully 100 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>after Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves </v>

14
00:01:01.841 --> 00:01:03.340
<v Speaker 1>with the emancipation proclamation</v>

15
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.333
<v Speaker 3>five years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a great American in whose symbolic </v>

16
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.740
<v Speaker 3>shadow we stand today signed the </v>
<v Speaker 3>emancipation proclamation.</v>

17
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.800
<v Speaker 1>The very first line of the speech is </v>
<v Speaker 1>already doing so much.</v>

18
00:01:18.801 --> 00:01:19.634
<v Speaker 1>The first four words are an illusion to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lincoln's Gettysburg address and </v>

19
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.590
<v Speaker 1>instantly recognizable piece of American</v>
<v Speaker 1>rhetoric that in one fell swoop,</v>

20
00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.290
<v Speaker 1>links America's founding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which Lincoln spoke of,</v>

21
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.393
<v Speaker 1>and the civil war when he spoke with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight for civil rights throughout the </v>

22
00:01:34.911 --> 00:01:35.744
<v Speaker 1>speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>King takes great pains to make links </v>

23
00:01:37.371 --> 00:01:38.204
<v Speaker 1>like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's important for him to frame civil </v>

24
00:01:39.531 --> 00:01:40.364
<v Speaker 1>rights as a chapter in the larger </v>
<v Speaker 1>American mythology so that those who </v>

25
00:01:44.571 --> 00:01:45.404
<v Speaker 1>identify with that mythology might </v>
<v Speaker 1>incorporate this struggle into that </v>

26
00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:49.510
<v Speaker 1>story</v>

27
00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.170
<v Speaker 3>on a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on a bill of rights,</v>

28
00:01:51.171 --> 00:01:52.580
<v Speaker 3>of life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>liberty,</v>

29
00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.280
<v Speaker 3>and the pursuit of happiness,</v>

30
00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.880
<v Speaker 1>but there's even more to see in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>first line.</v>

31
00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.080
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that makes king's </v>
<v Speaker 1>words so memorable is their musicality.</v>

32
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.033
<v Speaker 1>Here he uses a literation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five words starting with the letter s </v>

33
00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.760
<v Speaker 1>that draw you along the sentence like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tune that's catchy.</v>

34
00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:10.653
<v Speaker 1>Alliteration helps a phrase stick in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind and king returns to it again and </v>

35
00:02:14.261 --> 00:02:15.340
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this speech,</v>

36
00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.140
<v Speaker 3>dark and desolate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's sweltering,</v>

37
00:02:18.141 --> 00:02:20.790
<v Speaker 3>some out of the Negroes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>legitimate discontent,</v>

38
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.960
<v Speaker 3>the marvelous new militancy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trials and tribulations,</v>

39
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.000
<v Speaker 3>dignity and discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In a sense,</v>

40
00:02:27.001 --> 00:02:30.900
<v Speaker 3>we've come to our nation's capital to </v>
<v Speaker 3>cash a check.</v>

41
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.680
<v Speaker 1>This isn't the only rhythmically aware </v>
<v Speaker 1>or musical feature of I have a dream.</v>

42
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.350
<v Speaker 1>There's another rhetorical device called</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anaphora,</v>

43
00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.213
<v Speaker 1>which can use is even more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>alliteration and Africa is the </v>

44
00:02:41.491 --> 00:02:45.270
<v Speaker 1>repetition of a word or phrase at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning of success of sentences,</v>

45
00:02:45.271 --> 00:02:48.150
<v Speaker 1>something that in writing would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>redundant,</v>

46
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.620
<v Speaker 1>but in speech is an effective tool for </v>
<v Speaker 1>emphasis and I have a dream.</v>

47
00:02:52.621 --> 00:02:55.590
<v Speaker 1>Martin Luther King uses an Afro as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>emphasizing tool,</v>

48
00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:56.453
<v Speaker 1>but also as an organizing device.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen to how phrases sketch the larger </v>

49
00:03:00.911 --> 00:03:03.640
<v Speaker 1>ideas of the speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost like an outline,</v>

50
00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.810
<v Speaker 2>but 100 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>100 years,</v>

51
00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.220
<v Speaker 2>100 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>100 years later,</v>

52
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.260
<v Speaker 2>we refused.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We refused to believe.</v>

53
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.880
<v Speaker 2>Now is the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now is the power.</v>

54
00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.860
<v Speaker 2>We can never be satisfied.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can never be satisfied.</v>

55
00:03:18.861 --> 00:03:22.080
<v Speaker 2>We cannot be satisfied.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can never be satisfied.</v>

56
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.210
<v Speaker 2>I have a dream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a dream.</v>

57
00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.880
<v Speaker 2>I have a dream.</v>

58
00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.170
<v Speaker 3>Freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Freedom,</v>

59
00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.290
<v Speaker 3>freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>freedom ring.</v>

60
00:03:31.291 --> 00:03:32.230
<v Speaker 3>Let Freedom Ring.</v>

61
00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.510
<v Speaker 1>The speech goes from the past to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>present to the future of civil rights,</v>

62
00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.780
<v Speaker 1>and it's threaded with a refusal to </v>
<v Speaker 1>settle for anything other than the ideal</v>

63
00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:42.653
<v Speaker 1>of freedom and equality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this is a key to martin luther </v>

64
00:03:44.971 --> 00:03:48.330
<v Speaker 1>king's rhetorical genius,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drawing from his Gospel roots.</v>

65
00:03:48.331 --> 00:03:49.164
<v Speaker 1>He not only uses alliteration and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Anaphora even illusion for dramatic </v>

66
00:03:52.831 --> 00:03:53.664
<v Speaker 1>effect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also to help the audience grasp of </v>

67
00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.950
<v Speaker 1>the structure and remember the nuance of</v>
<v Speaker 1>his message.</v>

68
00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.993
<v Speaker 1>King knows that for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you may not know this line from </v>

69
00:04:01.891 --> 00:04:02.620
<v Speaker 1>Shakespeare</v>

70
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.620
<v Speaker 4>that was the winter of our discontent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>made glorious suburb by this sun appeal,</v>

71
00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.120
<v Speaker 1>but the phrase will ring familiar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sweltering,</v>

72
00:04:14.121 --> 00:04:14.954
<v Speaker 1>some out of the Negroes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>legitimate discontent will not pass </v>

73
00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:19.003
<v Speaker 1>until that is an invigorating autumn of </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom and equality king shifts the </v>

74
00:04:23.031 --> 00:04:23.811
<v Speaker 1>seasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

75
00:04:23.811 --> 00:04:25.760
<v Speaker 1>because for those who live in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>American south,</v>

76
00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:26.623
<v Speaker 1>autumn is more relieving than summer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know your audience and sticking with </v>

77
00:04:29.391 --> 00:04:30.224
<v Speaker 1>this paragraph for just a moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>notice that this sentence of </v>

78
00:04:32.211 --> 00:04:37.180
<v Speaker 1>shakespearian poetry is couched in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>point about urgency and not settling and</v>

79
00:04:37.181 --> 00:04:41.180
<v Speaker 1>the king isn't all flowery language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He draws that image of paradise.</v>

80
00:04:41.181 --> 00:04:42.014
<v Speaker 1>Then follows it with a sentence that </v>
<v Speaker 1>contains three easy to understand </v>

81
00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:45.733
<v Speaker 1>cliches,</v>

82
00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:46.703
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that the Negro needed to blow off </v>

83
00:04:48.811 --> 00:04:53.760
<v Speaker 3>steam and will now be content,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will have a rude awakening if the nation</v>

84
00:04:53.761 --> 00:04:55.830
<v Speaker 3>returns to business as usual.</v>

85
00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.913
<v Speaker 1>This mixing of plain and slash or neat </v>
<v Speaker 1>language is I think a microcosm of what </v>

86
00:05:00.341 --> 00:05:03.760
<v Speaker 1>occurs in the entire speech after </v>
<v Speaker 1>alluding to the Gettysburg address.</v>

87
00:05:03.761 --> 00:05:07.330
<v Speaker 1>In the declaration of Independence King </v>
<v Speaker 1>Compares the promises of those documents</v>

88
00:05:07.331 --> 00:05:09.160
<v Speaker 1>to a bad check.</v>

89
00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.620
<v Speaker 3>I'll check which has come back marked </v>
<v Speaker 3>insufficient funds.</v>

90
00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.660
<v Speaker 1>You're invoking the plane realities of </v>
<v Speaker 1>police brutality for whites only,</v>

91
00:05:16.661 --> 00:05:19.540
<v Speaker 1>signs and voter suppression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He paraphrases</v>

92
00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:20.473
<v Speaker 3>Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We will not be satisfied until justice </v>

93
00:05:23.031 --> 00:05:27.290
<v Speaker 3>rolls down like waters and righteousness</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a mighty stream.</v>

94
00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:28.393
<v Speaker 1>The first half of the speech describes </v>
<v Speaker 1>in large part the issue at hand what is </v>

95
00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:33.910
<v Speaker 1>to be done and demanded what is to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>avoided,</v>

96
00:05:33.911 --> 00:05:34.744
<v Speaker 1>and he tells those who have suffered to </v>
<v Speaker 1>hold fast and believe while the final </v>

97
00:05:38.531 --> 00:05:41.410
<v Speaker 1>part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was famously improvised by King on</v>

98
00:05:41.411 --> 00:05:44.620
<v Speaker 1>the spot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rises into the heights of dreams</v>

99
00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:46.023
<v Speaker 3>I have shall be exalted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every hill and mountain shall be made </v>

100
00:05:52.431 --> 00:05:54.320
<v Speaker 3>low.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The rough places will be made.</v>

101
00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:55.213
<v Speaker 3>Wayne and the crooked places will be </v>
<v Speaker 3>made straight and the Lord shall be </v>

102
00:05:59.121 --> 00:06:02.240
<v Speaker 3>revealed and all smashed shall see it </v>
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>

103
00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:05.180
<v Speaker 1>In my video analyzing Donald Trump's </v>
<v Speaker 1>speech,</v>

104
00:06:05.181 --> 00:06:06.014
<v Speaker 1>I talked about how he was able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>connect with people by using simple </v>

105
00:06:09.351 --> 00:06:10.184
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a good general rule for public </v>

106
00:06:11.751 --> 00:06:12.584
<v Speaker 1>speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're addressing a large diverse </v>

107
00:06:14.271 --> 00:06:15.104
<v Speaker 1>audience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most important part of rhetoric is </v>

108
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.833
<v Speaker 1>being understood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump does this by keeping his words </v>

109
00:06:20.121 --> 00:06:20.954
<v Speaker 1>basic and emotional and it works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think Martin Luther King offers a </v>

110
00:06:25.431 --> 00:06:26.264
<v Speaker 1>counterexample of public speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one that's more complex and layered in </v>

111
00:06:29.781 --> 00:06:30.614
<v Speaker 1>language and structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but still just as easily understandable </v>

112
00:06:33.741 --> 00:06:38.060
<v Speaker 1>as anything that current politicians or </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaker say and I have a dream.</v>

113
00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:42.740
<v Speaker 1>The simple language contextualizes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>grounds the poetic and the poetic,</v>

114
00:06:42.741 --> 00:06:43.574
<v Speaker 1>elevates and animates the simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why it echoes across time and </v>

115
00:06:48.501 --> 00:06:53.501
<v Speaker 1>will echo for decades and ages to come </v>
<v Speaker 1>something vital and alive.</v>

116
00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:59.660
<v Speaker 3>We won't be able to feed children,</v>
<v Speaker 3>black men and white men,</v>

117
00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:02.413
<v Speaker 3>Jews and gentiles,</v>
