00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.060
<v Speaker 1>Copy on a Tuesday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>

2
00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:03.880
<v Speaker 1>who are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm waiting for winter.</v>

3
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.210
<v Speaker 1>I know who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing in my video?</v>

4
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:08.543
<v Speaker 1>My video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is clearly every week and you're </v>

5
00:00:11.581 --> 00:00:12.414
<v Speaker 1>infringing upon it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't remove yourself at one </v>

6
00:00:13.771 --> 00:00:15.760
<v Speaker 1>point I will be forced to call youtube </v>
<v Speaker 1>security.</v>

7
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:20.700
<v Speaker 1>Don't don't cut that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have me on hold.</v>

8
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:21.893
<v Speaker 1>Me Too.</v>

9
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.450
<v Speaker 2>I don't want.</v>

10
00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.750
<v Speaker 1>Here's a phenomenon you might be </v>
<v Speaker 1>familiar with to demonstrate.</v>

11
00:00:44.751 --> 00:00:46.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to enlist the help of Craig </v>
<v Speaker 1>Benzie.</v>

12
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:47.533
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise known as.</v>

13
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:51.713
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sitting at his desk editing one of his </v>

14
00:00:52.501 --> 00:00:53.550
<v Speaker 1>videos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's late.</v>

15
00:00:53.551 --> 00:00:54.384
<v Speaker 1>He's getting tired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything's another cup of coffee is in </v>

16
00:00:56.071 --> 00:00:56.700
<v Speaker 1>order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he.</v>

17
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.250
<v Speaker 1>He goes into the kitchen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pours himself a cup and realizes that he</v>

18
00:00:59.251 --> 00:01:01.560
<v Speaker 1>has to go into the time machine room </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he needs to get the.</v>

19
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.050
<v Speaker 1>Wait a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did he need?</v>

20
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:05.393
<v Speaker 1>He can't seem to remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first impulse is to go back to the </v>

21
00:01:07.321 --> 00:01:09.300
<v Speaker 1>kitchen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stand by the coffee machine that Oh yes,</v>

22
00:01:09.301 --> 00:01:09.691
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

23
00:01:09.691 --> 00:01:10.524
<v Speaker 1>Now we remember he needed the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you've all had this experience </v>

24
00:01:14.041 --> 00:01:14.874
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the experience of arriving somewhere </v>

25
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.140
<v Speaker 1>only to realize that you've forgotten </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you went through to do.</v>

26
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.580
<v Speaker 1>Why does this happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

27
00:01:20.581 --> 00:01:22.820
<v Speaker 1>last year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>neurological researchers from Notre Dame</v>

28
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.430
<v Speaker 1>published an article called why walking </v>
<v Speaker 1>through doorways causes,</v>

29
00:01:26.431 --> 00:01:28.140
<v Speaker 1>forget it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a good title,</v>

30
00:01:28.141 --> 00:01:28.974
<v Speaker 1>and their thesis is that at all times </v>
<v Speaker 1>our brains are operating within </v>

31
00:01:32.551 --> 00:01:36.570
<v Speaker 1>something called an event model,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a collection of memories relevant to the</v>

32
00:01:36.571 --> 00:01:37.404
<v Speaker 1>current activity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>walking through a doorway can </v>

33
00:01:39.181 --> 00:01:40.014
<v Speaker 1>unintentionally purge this model because</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever was happening in the old room </v>

34
00:01:43.081 --> 00:01:44.400
<v Speaker 1>is less likely to be relevant.</v>

35
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:45.383
<v Speaker 1>Now that you've changed venues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brains do this to us well because </v>

36
00:01:48.811 --> 00:01:50.790
<v Speaker 1>normally event models operate </v>
<v Speaker 1>beautifully.</v>

37
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.500
<v Speaker 1>It would be impossible to keep all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>our memories at the fore of our mind,</v>

38
00:01:54.501 --> 00:01:55.334
<v Speaker 1>so our brain's employee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this incredible mechanism to keep all </v>

39
00:01:57.541 --> 00:01:58.374
<v Speaker 1>the relevant memories within reach and </v>
<v Speaker 1>event modeled as being built in your </v>

40
00:02:02.101 --> 00:02:05.490
<v Speaker 1>brain right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

41
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.530
<v Speaker 1>but I'd like to make a larger point here</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I met you.</v>

42
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:11.000
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this whole business with the vent models</v>

43
00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.843
<v Speaker 1>gives us a great universally </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognizable example of the fact that </v>

44
00:02:14.011 --> 00:02:18.000
<v Speaker 1>our brains are busy every moment with </v>
<v Speaker 1>activities of which were not aware.</v>

45
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:19.043
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before we are aware of any one thing </v>

46
00:02:19.831 --> 00:02:20.664
<v Speaker 1>that we do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are a series of neurological </v>

47
00:02:21.811 --> 00:02:22.644
<v Speaker 1>activities proceeding it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Benjamin Libet of pioneering scientists </v>

48
00:02:25.201 --> 00:02:26.034
<v Speaker 1>in the field of human consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 1>famously proved that activity in the </v>

49
00:02:28.171 --> 00:02:29.004
<v Speaker 1>brain can be measured some 300 </v>
<v Speaker 1>milliseconds before the person feels </v>

50
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.980
<v Speaker 1>that he has decided to move today with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the use of Mri.</v>

51
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.010
<v Speaker 1>That estimate has been extended to </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like six seconds.</v>

52
00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.873
<v Speaker 1>How should this be extrapolated in </v>
<v Speaker 1>regard to a concept we all know as </v>

53
00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.690
<v Speaker 1>freewill freewill is at the basis of </v>
<v Speaker 1>nearly all our belief systems,</v>

54
00:02:45.691 --> 00:02:48.570
<v Speaker 1>it founds not only moral considerations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but legal ones.</v>

55
00:02:48.571 --> 00:02:49.404
<v Speaker 1>The concepts of incarceration in </v>
<v Speaker 1>retribution are bound up with </v>

56
00:02:52.291 --> 00:02:55.290
<v Speaker 1>responsibility which is bound up with </v>
<v Speaker 1>free choice,</v>

57
00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>but as we've seen our choices proceed </v>
<v Speaker 1>from neural activity of which we are,</v>

58
00:02:59.981 --> 00:03:01.390
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not aware,</v>

59
00:03:01.391 --> 00:03:04.840
<v Speaker 1>so does does this mean for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that a murderer complete the defense?</v>

60
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.440
<v Speaker 1>My brain made me do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Einstein didn't believe in freewill yet,</v>

61
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.720
<v Speaker 1>he still believed that murderer should </v>
<v Speaker 1>be put in jail.</v>

62
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.890
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

63
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:12.723
<v Speaker 1>because they're dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that neural activity proceeds </v>

64
00:03:15.971 --> 00:03:16.804
<v Speaker 1>and determines our choices doesn't mean </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the murderer can separate the part </v>

65
00:03:19.481 --> 00:03:22.480
<v Speaker 1>of himself which is responsible for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>act of murder.</v>

66
00:03:22.481 --> 00:03:24.310
<v Speaker 1>We are choosing all the time.</v>

67
00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.120
<v Speaker 1>We can't help it even with the knowledge</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we can't choose what we choose.</v>

68
00:03:28.121 --> 00:03:28.954
<v Speaker 1>We can't stop choosing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can sit there and do nothing but </v>

69
00:03:31.601 --> 00:03:34.870
<v Speaker 1>doing nothing is itself a choice and one</v>
<v Speaker 1>that gets harder with every second.</v>

70
00:03:34.871 --> 00:03:35.704
<v Speaker 1>Eventually you'll decide that this </v>
<v Speaker 1>business of doing nothing is a waste of </v>

71
00:03:37.871 --> 00:03:38.704
<v Speaker 1>your time and you'll choose to get up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe we should imagine our </v>

72
00:03:43.661 --> 00:03:48.460
<v Speaker 1>consciousness as something like a river </v>
<v Speaker 1>choice exists as a part of that river,</v>

73
00:03:48.461 --> 00:03:49.294
<v Speaker 1>but some ways downstream from the source</v>
<v Speaker 1>and farther downstream from the choice </v>

74
00:03:52.421 --> 00:03:56.680
<v Speaker 1>is the action and the action has real </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences in the world around you and</v>

75
00:03:56.681 --> 00:03:57.514
<v Speaker 1>those consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To the extent that you're around a </v>

76
00:03:59.181 --> 00:04:01.390
<v Speaker 1>witness them have an effect on the river</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a whole.</v>

77
00:04:01.391 --> 00:04:02.224
<v Speaker 1>See that the mysterious source of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>river for the most part is not acting </v>

78
00:04:05.651 --> 00:04:06.484
<v Speaker 1>against you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not an external consciousness and </v>

79
00:04:08.411 --> 00:04:10.090
<v Speaker 1>it's not a random decision generator.</v>

80
00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.870
<v Speaker 1>It acts in harmony with your beliefs and</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideals,</v>

81
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:14.733
<v Speaker 1>with what makes you happy and sad and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's informed by the consequences of </v>

82
00:04:17.921 --> 00:04:18.754
<v Speaker 1>your choices and by the choices of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>around you and by the environment in </v>

83
00:04:21.281 --> 00:04:25.120
<v Speaker 1>which you live and grow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is an experiential disconnect here</v>

84
00:04:25.121 --> 00:04:27.970
<v Speaker 1>which is hard to overcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you look back over your day,</v>

85
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:29.080
<v Speaker 1>your month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your life,</v>

86
00:04:29.081 --> 00:04:31.810
<v Speaker 1>you feel as if you were the author of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your choices,</v>

87
00:04:31.811 --> 00:04:35.610
<v Speaker 1>you feel as if you chose this road as </v>
<v Speaker 1>opposed to that road and that over time,</v>

88
00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:36.633
<v Speaker 1>this free decider,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you call I has built its own </v>

89
00:04:39.161 --> 00:04:39.994
<v Speaker 1>identity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is that this is impossible </v>

90
00:04:41.981 --> 00:04:42.814
<v Speaker 1>to reconcile with the fact that at every</v>
<v Speaker 1>moment of your life you're being </v>

91
00:04:46.061 --> 00:04:49.670
<v Speaker 1>informed by unconscious processes like </v>
<v Speaker 1>say event models.</v>

92
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.460
<v Speaker 1>Free will is an illusion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's difficult to accept.</v>

93
00:04:54.461 --> 00:04:55.294
<v Speaker 1>It's difficult for me to accept that my </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness is telling me a story </v>

94
00:04:57.881 --> 00:05:00.010
<v Speaker 1>about myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which isn't true,</v>

95
00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:01.263
<v Speaker 1>but I can know it despite my feelings </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I can remind myself of it when I </v>

96
00:05:05.171 --> 00:05:10.171
<v Speaker 1>take myself too seriously or I'm too </v>
<v Speaker 1>hard on myself for mistakes and maybe in</v>

97
00:05:10.241 --> 00:05:12.160
<v Speaker 1>endeavoring to understand this part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

98
00:05:12.161 --> 00:05:16.420
<v Speaker 1>I can become more empathetic toward </v>
<v Speaker 1>those who like me,</v>

99
00:05:16.421 --> 00:05:17.254
<v Speaker 1>like all of us try so desperately hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>to control their lives and trip up in </v>

100
00:05:21.461 --> 00:05:23.710
<v Speaker 1>the most spectacular ways.</v>

101
00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.380
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember what I was supposed to do,</v>

102
00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:31.573
<v Speaker 3>what I have to save the world from this </v>
<v Speaker 3>nuclear explosion by setting the time </v>

103
00:05:34.371 --> 00:05:35.204
<v Speaker 3>machine.</v>

104
00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.760
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>
