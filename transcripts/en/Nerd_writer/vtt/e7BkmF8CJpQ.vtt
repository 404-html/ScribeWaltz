1
00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:12.610
<v Speaker 1>Before you see one single image in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lord of the Rings trilogy and you hear a</v>

2
00:00:13.311 --> 00:00:18.311
<v Speaker 1>chorus singing in a somewhat unsettling </v>
<v Speaker 1>harmonic minor key over black,</v>

3
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.580
<v Speaker 1>this is a musical theme that signals the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Loft Florian else.</v>

4
00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:25.723
<v Speaker 1>It's the theme of glad drill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's about to narrate the story of the </v>

5
00:00:28.971 --> 00:00:32.780
<v Speaker 1>one ring and prologue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not before the rings.</v>

6
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.840
<v Speaker 1>Own feet fades in with the first title </v>
<v Speaker 1>as the prologue ends and an e flat minor</v>

7
00:00:45.951 --> 00:00:46.784
<v Speaker 1>chord shifts to an e flat major.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The narration shifts also from </v>

8
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.750
<v Speaker 1>collateral to Bilbo Sean and the mood </v>
<v Speaker 1>changes.</v>

9
00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:54.703
<v Speaker 1>The lighter shyer theme is introduced as</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bilbo places us there on a map and </v>

10
00:00:59.331 --> 00:01:01.790
<v Speaker 1>finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after he places us in time,</v>

11
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.300
<v Speaker 1>the fellowship theme plays in full </v>
<v Speaker 1>statement as its corresponding subtitled</v>

12
00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.250
<v Speaker 1>fades in racketing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the opening of the film.</v>

13
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.520
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if this masterful interplay of themes is</v>

14
00:01:19.521 --> 00:01:24.200
<v Speaker 1>it enough to prove to you already that </v>
<v Speaker 1>composer Howard shore is a genius,</v>

15
00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.720
<v Speaker 1>that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot more to say.</v>

16
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.883
<v Speaker 1>The first thing is that these four </v>
<v Speaker 1>themes that I've mentioned are actually </v>

17
00:01:30.321 --> 00:01:35.321
<v Speaker 1>what's called light motifs and operatic </v>
<v Speaker 1>technique popularized by Richard Wagner,</v>

18
00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.740
<v Speaker 1>that fuses musical themes with specific </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

19
00:01:39.741 --> 00:01:40.574
<v Speaker 1>events or places to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in some cases augment the dramatic </v>

20
00:01:44.391 --> 00:01:45.224
<v Speaker 1>development of a story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In order to show how short develops his </v>

21
00:01:48.171 --> 00:01:49.004
<v Speaker 1>light motifs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to isolate one the fellowship </v>

22
00:01:51.831 --> 00:01:52.664
<v Speaker 1>theme,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has the most variations and focus </v>

23
00:01:54.981 --> 00:01:57.320
<v Speaker 1>on its development in the fellowship of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ring.</v>

24
00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.330
<v Speaker 1>Now before the fellowship theme can come</v>
<v Speaker 1>together in its full heroic glory short,</v>

25
00:02:02.331 --> 00:02:03.164
<v Speaker 1>builds it up with a few variations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first time we hear it after the </v>

26
00:02:06.111 --> 00:02:11.111
<v Speaker 1>title is when Frodo and Sam leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Shire on the road to Rivendale short</v>

27
00:02:11.511 --> 00:02:15.770
<v Speaker 1>presents a small snippet of the shyer </v>
<v Speaker 1>theme of foreshadowing of that themes,</v>

28
00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:16.723
<v Speaker 1>final variation at the end of the film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then transitions into a humble </v>

29
00:02:20.151 --> 00:02:24.380
<v Speaker 1>statement of the fellowship theme using </v>
<v Speaker 1>just French Horn and core,</v>

30
00:02:24.381 --> 00:02:25.214
<v Speaker 1>and Glen.</v>

31
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.720
<v Speaker 1>It's a dangerous business for them going</v>
<v Speaker 1>out gentle.</v>

32
00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.730
<v Speaker 1>This is almost immediately contrasted </v>
<v Speaker 1>with another darker variation as Gandalf</v>

33
00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.630
<v Speaker 1>rides into isengard to take counsel with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sal.</v>

34
00:02:37.631 --> 00:02:38.464
<v Speaker 1>Roma sure adds crashing cymbals and </v>
<v Speaker 1>plays the theme off Gandalf's galloping </v>

35
00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.400
<v Speaker 1>horse in this tense variation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>prefigure Sarah Mons eventual portrayal,</v>

36
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.350
<v Speaker 1>and the two versions playing off each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>

37
00:02:48.351 --> 00:02:51.620
<v Speaker 1>anticipate the eventual fracturing of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fellowship later in the film.</v>

38
00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:52.783
<v Speaker 1>The next time we hear the theme,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Frodo and the hobbits have accepted </v>

39
00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.550
<v Speaker 1>stridor or eric as their temporary </v>
<v Speaker 1>leader.</v>

40
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.470
<v Speaker 1>The fellowship is growing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the brass section is growing too.</v>

41
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.830
<v Speaker 1>We started with one French horn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we have three,</v>

42
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.083
<v Speaker 1>but the state lead melody of the student</v>
<v Speaker 1>is upset with the Timpani drumbeat that </v>

43
00:03:10.181 --> 00:03:11.014
<v Speaker 1>adds urgency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Fellowship Light Motif doesn't </v>

44
00:03:15.741 --> 00:03:16.574
<v Speaker 1>appear again until after Frodo has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>stabbed by the ring greats as our when </v>

45
00:03:20.421 --> 00:03:21.254
<v Speaker 1>racist to get him to Rivendale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fellowship theme mixes with a </v>

46
00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:24.293
<v Speaker 1>Raytheon threatening to overtake it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fellowship might dissolve before it </v>

47
00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:29.050
<v Speaker 1>even has a chance to fully</v>

48
00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:30.223
<v Speaker 2>form</v>

49
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.913
<v Speaker 1>at the middle of the film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fellowship finally comes together </v>

50
00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:39.183
<v Speaker 1>and sure echoes that by presenting a </v>
<v Speaker 1>string of three fellowship theme </v>

51
00:03:42.851 --> 00:03:46.540
<v Speaker 1>statements in their full orchestration </v>
<v Speaker 1>and full glory.</v>

52
00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.853
<v Speaker 1>First as l,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ron announces the fellowship third as </v>

53
00:03:52.291 --> 00:03:54.970
<v Speaker 1>the fellowship strides heroically away </v>
<v Speaker 1>on own</v>

54
00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:56.003
<v Speaker 2>quest.</v>

55
00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.470
<v Speaker 1>But the second one is the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting to me,</v>

56
00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.300
<v Speaker 1>just as the fellowship is about to </v>
<v Speaker 1>depart.</v>

57
00:04:07.301 --> 00:04:08.134
<v Speaker 1>Shore softly teases the Shire theme </v>
<v Speaker 1>before eight is overpowered by the </v>

58
00:04:12.161 --> 00:04:12.994
<v Speaker 1>fellowship theme,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suggesting that the hobbits priorities </v>

59
00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.710
<v Speaker 1>have shifted and they now have to live </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the consequences of that,</v>

60
00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:19.053
<v Speaker 1>and it ends with a unique harmony on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>second half of the full statement as if </v>

61
00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:25.570
<v Speaker 1>to sow a seed of doubt right into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>middle of the team.</v>

62
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.873
<v Speaker 1>As it comes together,</v>

63
00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.103
<v Speaker 2>fellowship,</v>

64
00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.470
<v Speaker 1>we're going to get another exciting full</v>
<v Speaker 1>statement in the mines of Moria.</v>

65
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:39.333
<v Speaker 1>The only time that the nine members of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fellowship will be an action </v>

66
00:04:42.191 --> 00:04:43.840
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the three,</v>

67
00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:44.693
<v Speaker 1>four time signature of the fellowship is</v>
<v Speaker 1>quickly swallowed up by the five four </v>

68
00:04:48.491 --> 00:04:51.760
<v Speaker 1>time signature of the orcs and from now </v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

69
00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:56.050
<v Speaker 1>after Gandalf is lost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fellowship theme will only appear in</v>

70
00:04:56.051 --> 00:04:59.590
<v Speaker 1>fragmented form until the very end of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the trilogy.</v>

71
00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.020
<v Speaker 1>Your foods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

72
00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.980
<v Speaker 1>after what's left with the fellowship </v>
<v Speaker 1>departs Laurian.</v>

73
00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.510
<v Speaker 1>The theme can only muster violins and </v>
<v Speaker 1>cor.</v>

74
00:05:07.511 --> 00:05:08.344
<v Speaker 1>Anglais and sure has this already weak </v>
<v Speaker 1>variation trampled on as soon as it </v>

75
00:05:12.371 --> 00:05:16.390
<v Speaker 1>starts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then as they rest on the shore,</v>

76
00:05:16.391 --> 00:05:21.040
<v Speaker 1>the light motif can't find its footing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wanders away from its full expression</v>

77
00:05:21.041 --> 00:05:26.041
<v Speaker 1>as uncertainty and suspicion creep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>been facing these insecure variations on</v>

78
00:05:28.331 --> 00:05:29.230
<v Speaker 1>the theme,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Harold,</v>

79
00:05:29.231 --> 00:05:32.610
<v Speaker 1>the breaking of the fellowship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first with the death of former,</v>

80
00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.110
<v Speaker 1>then with the departure of Frodo and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sam,</v>

81
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:36.543
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>short links these two moments with a </v>

82
00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:39.393
<v Speaker 1>severely deflated but poignant rendition</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the light motif that fades into </v>

83
00:05:45.521 --> 00:05:46.354
<v Speaker 1>silence</v>

84
00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.823
<v Speaker 1>like the fellowship itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fellowship theme builds to its full </v>

85
00:06:02.481 --> 00:06:03.314
<v Speaker 1>formation and then is deconstructed </v>
<v Speaker 1>until it's only a shell of its former </v>

86
00:06:07.191 --> 00:06:10.340
<v Speaker 1>self.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shore does this with instrumentation,</v>

87
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.233
<v Speaker 1>with tempo and with harmony,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he does it for several other light </v>

88
00:06:14.331 --> 00:06:15.164
<v Speaker 1>motifs in the trilogy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weaving them back and forth and through </v>

89
00:06:18.141 --> 00:06:18.974
<v Speaker 1>one another so that the result is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>complex web that entwines with the </v>

90
00:06:22.881 --> 00:06:23.714
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that we hardly grasp the </v>

91
00:06:26.931 --> 00:06:27.764
<v Speaker 1>importance of music in film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an invisible layer of pure emotion </v>

92
00:06:31.941 --> 00:06:36.230
<v Speaker 1>that guides us or challenges us or </v>
<v Speaker 1>guides or challenges.</v>

93
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.530
<v Speaker 1>The drama itself and the Lord of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rings trilogy.</v>

94
00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:40.393
<v Speaker 1>Howard shore gave us perhaps the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>complete and complex exploration of </v>

95
00:06:44.661 --> 00:06:45.494
<v Speaker 1>light motifs in the history of cinema </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the result is a score that says </v>

96
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.620
<v Speaker 1>alive as the world Tokyo gave us.</v>

97
