1
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.140
<v Speaker 1>There's a three minute and 20 ish second</v>
<v Speaker 1>long scene in the middle of the animated</v>

2
00:00:25.141 --> 00:00:27.780
<v Speaker 1>Saifai Action Thriller Ghost in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Shell.</v>

3
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.310
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't really qualify as Saifai </v>
<v Speaker 1>action or thriller.</v>

4
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.473
<v Speaker 1>It's a sequence of 34 gorgeous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exquisitely detailed atmospheric shots </v>

5
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:39.143
<v Speaker 1>of a future city in Japan that's modeled</v>
<v Speaker 1>after Hong Kong and I'm tempted to make </v>

6
00:00:43.471 --> 00:00:46.740
<v Speaker 1>an hour long video dissecting each shot </v>
<v Speaker 1>individually,</v>

7
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.963
<v Speaker 1>but I really want to look at what this </v>
<v Speaker 1>interlude accomplishes as a whole by </v>

8
00:00:51.691 --> 00:00:54.810
<v Speaker 1>itself and in the context of the film </v>
<v Speaker 1>and its themes.</v>

9
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.153
<v Speaker 1>The first thing to note is that this </v>
<v Speaker 1>montage is full of what Scott mccloud </v>

10
00:00:58.411 --> 00:00:59.244
<v Speaker 1>has called aspect to aspect transitions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mccloud is the author of an absolutely </v>

11
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.003
<v Speaker 1>essential graphic novel on the art and </v>
<v Speaker 1>craft of comics and in it he describes </v>

12
00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:09.834
<v Speaker 1>the kind of panel to panel transitions </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have become popular in different </v>

13
00:01:13.111 --> 00:01:15.240
<v Speaker 1>parts of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In American comics,</v>

14
00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:16.074
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the majority of transitions are action </v>

15
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.450
<v Speaker 1>to action fitting for a goal oriented </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>

16
00:01:21.451 --> 00:01:25.110
<v Speaker 1>interested in telling stories about goal</v>
<v Speaker 1>oriented characters.</v>

17
00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.363
<v Speaker 1>Japanese comics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the other hand have the long </v>

18
00:01:27.781 --> 00:01:30.510
<v Speaker 1>featured,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a kind of transition that is really very</v>

19
00:01:30.511 --> 00:01:34.470
<v Speaker 1>rarely seen in the west.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The aspect to aspect transition in which</v>

20
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.000
<v Speaker 1>time is virtually abandoned for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploration of space.</v>

21
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.860
<v Speaker 1>These kinds of transitions evoke a mood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They activate the senses and imagination</v>

22
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.843
<v Speaker 1>and they have a rich tradition in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Japan's use of like and often cyclical </v>

23
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:49.523
<v Speaker 1>works of art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The emphasis is on being there instead </v>

24
00:01:52.531 --> 00:01:57.390
<v Speaker 1>of getting there and it's that emphasis </v>
<v Speaker 1>at play in this interlude from ghost.</v>

25
00:01:57.391 --> 00:02:00.330
<v Speaker 1>In the shell though this is animation </v>
<v Speaker 1>and not comics.</v>

26
00:02:00.331 --> 00:02:04.170
<v Speaker 1>The aspect to aspect categorization is I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think pretty accurate.</v>

27
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean people and things move in these </v>
<v Speaker 1>frames,</v>

28
00:02:06.721 --> 00:02:07.554
<v Speaker 1>but it's impossible to tell if the shots</v>
<v Speaker 1>are meant to be read as temporarily </v>

29
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.023
<v Speaker 1>sequential and I think it's pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>obvious that that question is really </v>

30
00:02:14.971 --> 00:02:15.804
<v Speaker 1>just irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What director Mamoru Oshii accomplishes </v>

31
00:02:18.541 --> 00:02:19.374
<v Speaker 1>here is to expand and draw attention to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the audience's perception of space in </v>

32
00:02:24.091 --> 00:02:26.070
<v Speaker 1>the film and what kind of space is it?</v>

33
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.023
<v Speaker 1>It's the space of a chaotic </v>
<v Speaker 1>multicultural future city dominated by </v>

34
00:02:30.751 --> 00:02:35.100
<v Speaker 1>the intersections of old and new </v>
<v Speaker 1>structures connected by roads,</v>

35
00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.840
<v Speaker 1>canals and technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Humans move about like electricity along</v>

36
00:02:39.841 --> 00:02:43.200
<v Speaker 1>these avenues plugged into the body of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the metropolis,</v>

37
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:44.543
<v Speaker 1>the relationship between body and mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shell and ghost is of course a central </v>

38
00:02:48.241 --> 00:02:49.074
<v Speaker 1>theme of the film which tells the story </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a female Cyborg police officer who </v>

39
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.923
<v Speaker 1>with their team hunts down a notorious </v>
<v Speaker 1>hacker only to discover that he's an </v>

40
00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.630
<v Speaker 1>incor ai who wants to merge with her and</v>
<v Speaker 1>create a new higher life form.</v>

41
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.003
<v Speaker 1>Since most bodies in this future world </v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least partly artificial people </v>

42
00:03:09.251 --> 00:03:12.850
<v Speaker 1>locate their identities in their ghosts </v>
<v Speaker 1>or their minds,</v>

43
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.360
<v Speaker 1>but with the troubling knowledge that </v>
<v Speaker 1>these also can be hacked.</v>

44
00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.710
<v Speaker 1>Memory identity and humanity are all </v>
<v Speaker 1>calling into question.</v>

45
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.230
<v Speaker 1>All your memories about your wife and </v>
<v Speaker 1>daughter are false.</v>

46
00:03:23.231 --> 00:03:24.100
<v Speaker 1>They're like a dream.</v>

47
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.993
<v Speaker 1>Someone's taken advantage of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how can a meditation on space </v>

48
00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.370
<v Speaker 1>illuminate the problem and theme of </v>
<v Speaker 1>identity in Ghost in the shell?</v>

49
00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:34.463
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe the first thing we should say is </v>

50
00:03:35.351 --> 00:03:36.184
<v Speaker 1>that spaces like identities are </v>
<v Speaker 1>constructed though space often feels </v>

51
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.720
<v Speaker 1>neutral or given like we could move </v>
<v Speaker 1>anywhere within it.</v>

52
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.790
<v Speaker 1>Our movements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our activities,</v>

53
00:03:45.791 --> 00:03:50.791
<v Speaker 1>our life is always limited by the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>space is produced in most places,</v>

54
00:03:52.091 --> 00:03:52.924
<v Speaker 1>but especially in big cities that </v>
<v Speaker 1>production is controlled not by the </v>

55
00:03:55.811 --> 00:03:58.600
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but by gigantic moneyed interests,</v>

56
00:03:58.601 --> 00:04:03.370
<v Speaker 1>state governments or both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the same is true for identity spaces</v>

57
00:04:03.371 --> 00:04:07.390
<v Speaker 1>and identities are constructed and not </v>
<v Speaker 1>always by ourselves.</v>

58
00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:08.253
<v Speaker 1>In this respect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hong Kong was the perfect city to model </v>

59
00:04:11.261 --> 00:04:12.094
<v Speaker 1>for this film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a city layered with histories and </v>

60
00:04:14.171 --> 00:04:16.060
<v Speaker 1>cultural memory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Believe it or not,</v>

61
00:04:16.061 --> 00:04:18.190
<v Speaker 1>when ghost in the shell came out in </v>
<v Speaker 1>1995,</v>

62
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.510
<v Speaker 1>it was still a colony or territory of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the United Kingdom.</v>

63
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.440
<v Speaker 1>It had two years left on a 99 year lease</v>
<v Speaker 1>signed in 18,</v>

64
00:04:26.441 --> 00:04:27.274
<v Speaker 1>98,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was interrupted during the second </v>

65
00:04:28.931 --> 00:04:33.430
<v Speaker 1>world war by a four year occupation by </v>
<v Speaker 1>Japan now was about to be handed back to</v>

66
00:04:33.431 --> 00:04:37.840
<v Speaker 1>communist China with which it had little</v>
<v Speaker 1>relation in both politics and economy.</v>

67
00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.110
<v Speaker 1>So who were the Hong Kong people </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be?</v>

68
00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:42.003
<v Speaker 1>Then indeed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to define identity was and is a </v>

69
00:04:44.891 --> 00:04:49.360
<v Speaker 1>vital question in the postcolonial world</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the old empires faded,</v>

70
00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:50.463
<v Speaker 1>but left their centuries of subjugation </v>
<v Speaker 1>and influence in the streets and minds </v>

71
00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.060
<v Speaker 1>of multicultural cities like Hong Kong </v>
<v Speaker 1>and its inhabitants.</v>

72
00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.923
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to maintain the often </v>
<v Speaker 1>racist identities imposed on you by the </v>

73
00:05:02.711 --> 00:05:05.650
<v Speaker 1>colonizers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you really can't go back to what you</v>

74
00:05:05.651 --> 00:05:06.640
<v Speaker 1>were before</v>

75
00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:07.613
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about redefining my </v>

76
00:05:08.851 --> 00:05:09.684
<v Speaker 2>identity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to guarantee that I can still be </v>

77
00:05:11.551 --> 00:05:14.100
<v Speaker 2>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There isn't one.</v>

78
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.400
<v Speaker 2>Why would you wish to change in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>dynamic environment?</v>

79
00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.050
<v Speaker 2>Your effort to remain what you are is </v>
<v Speaker 2>what limits you.</v>

80
00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:23.610
<v Speaker 2>Look closely</v>

81
00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.980
<v Speaker 1>at the city and you can see these </v>
<v Speaker 1>dilemmas played out in space.</v>

82
00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:32.810
<v Speaker 1>Cyber punk has always featured these </v>
<v Speaker 1>uneasy composites of multiple cultures.</v>

83
00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.943
<v Speaker 1>These are not utopias,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't have to be imagined as </v>

84
00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.903
<v Speaker 1>dystopias either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The philosopher Michel Foucault called </v>

85
00:05:40.191 --> 00:05:42.370
<v Speaker 1>spaces like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Heterotopia,</v>

86
00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:47.360
<v Speaker 1>places that exist in a dynamic state of </v>
<v Speaker 1>layered and changing meanings.</v>

87
00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:48.493
<v Speaker 1>Heterotopia is don't succumb to those </v>
<v Speaker 1>forces that try to make everything the </v>

88
00:05:52.431 --> 00:05:53.264
<v Speaker 1>same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are marginal spaces for the </v>

89
00:05:54.951 --> 00:05:58.160
<v Speaker 1>voiceless to construct identities for </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

90
00:05:58.590 --> 00:05:59.423
<v Speaker 1>Cyber punks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great radical hope with that the </v>

91
00:06:01.161 --> 00:06:01.994
<v Speaker 1>blending of man and machine would have </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same effect on personal identity </v>

92
00:06:05.511 --> 00:06:09.530
<v Speaker 1>that multicultural cities like Hong Kong</v>
<v Speaker 1>would have on collective identity.</v>

93
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:10.633
<v Speaker 1>It would break down the constructs of </v>
<v Speaker 1>gender and race and class that have </v>

94
00:06:14.061 --> 00:06:14.894
<v Speaker 1>defined us for so long without our say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see that hope in the main </v>

95
00:06:18.351 --> 00:06:20.090
<v Speaker 1>character of ghost in the shell.</v>

96
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.433
<v Speaker 1>The three minute aspect to aspect </v>
<v Speaker 1>interlude in the middle of this film by </v>

97
00:06:24.471 --> 00:06:29.471
<v Speaker 1>its strong break from the rhythm of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>plot forces us to consider the parallels</v>

98
00:06:29.751 --> 00:06:34.100
<v Speaker 1>between city and body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>network and ghost to drive this home.</v>

99
00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:34.963
<v Speaker 1>The rest of the film is framed with </v>
<v Speaker 1>characters set against the city they </v>

100
00:06:38.961 --> 00:06:40.280
<v Speaker 1>live in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

101
00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:45.340
<v Speaker 1>spaces are made by humanity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but humanity is made by its spaces too.</v>

102
00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:47.143
<v Speaker 1>It's a feedback loop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A cycle made virtuous or vicious based </v>

103
00:06:50.991 --> 00:06:55.991
<v Speaker 1>on the choices we make together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ghost in the shell wants to show us that</v>

104
00:06:56.241 --> 00:07:01.241
<v Speaker 1>the dynamics of ourselves and our spaces</v>
<v Speaker 1>are one in the same.</v>

105
00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:13.193
<v Speaker 3>Hey everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thanks for watching and welcome to </v>

106
00:07:14.881 --> 00:07:17.460
<v Speaker 3>everybody who came in from last week's </v>
<v Speaker 3>children of men video.</v>

107
00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:22.080
<v Speaker 3>The response was absolutely nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so thanks for spreading it around.</v>

108
00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:22.973
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to say thank you because this </v>
<v Speaker 3>is actually the 10th video that I've </v>

109
00:07:25.501 --> 00:07:26.334
<v Speaker 3>made since I started to produce the nerd</v>
<v Speaker 3>writer full time and it's been an </v>

110
00:07:28.981 --> 00:07:33.360
<v Speaker 3>incredible 10 weeks and it's all because</v>
<v Speaker 3>of you guys supporting me on Patrion.</v>

111
00:07:33.361 --> 00:07:34.194
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wouldn't be possible without you </v>

112
00:07:34.891 --> 00:07:35.724
<v Speaker 3>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know some of you do it to get the </v>

113
00:07:36.571 --> 00:07:37.404
<v Speaker 3>rewards mugs and stickers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but most of you do it because you </v>

114
00:07:39.121 --> 00:07:43.080
<v Speaker 3>believe in this kind of relationship </v>
<v Speaker 3>between creator and audience.</v>

115
