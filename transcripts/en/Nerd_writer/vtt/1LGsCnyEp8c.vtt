1
00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.790
<v Speaker 1>It's quickly become apparent that jared </v>
<v Speaker 1>cushner,</v>

2
00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:09.530
<v Speaker 1>the 36 year old real estate investor and</v>
<v Speaker 1>husband,</v>

3
00:00:09.531 --> 00:00:10.364
<v Speaker 1>that Ivanka trump is president donald </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump's most trusted advisor within his </v>

4
00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:15.813
<v Speaker 1>inner circle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a circle whose top tier includes chief </v>

5
00:00:18.281 --> 00:00:19.600
<v Speaker 1>strategist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steve Bannon,</v>

6
00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:20.643
<v Speaker 1>and chief of staff reince priebus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's pretty easy to know where </v>

7
00:00:23.711 --> 00:00:24.544
<v Speaker 1>priebus and bannon stand politically as </v>
<v Speaker 1>chairman of the Republican National </v>

8
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:28.593
<v Speaker 1>Committee for five years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Priebus is the voice of the Republican </v>

9
00:00:30.461 --> 00:00:31.294
<v Speaker 1>establishment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as the former editor of Breitbart </v>

10
00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:34.413
<v Speaker 1>bannon champions the populist economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>nationalism that appeal to so many of </v>

11
00:00:36.941 --> 00:00:40.540
<v Speaker 1>trump's working class voters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's important to know where trump's key</v>

12
00:00:40.541 --> 00:00:41.374
<v Speaker 1>advisors stand on the issues because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost impossible to know where </v>

13
00:00:44.291 --> 00:00:47.410
<v Speaker 1>trump himself stands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump's not an idealogue.</v>

14
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.273
<v Speaker 1>He's a pragmatist who's changed his </v>
<v Speaker 1>views multiple times throughout the </v>

15
00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:52.870
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When it comes down to it,</v>

16
00:00:52.871 --> 00:00:55.720
<v Speaker 1>his political goals are basically this.</v>

17
00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:57.070
<v Speaker 2>We're going to win,</v>
<v Speaker 2>win,</v>

18
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.260
<v Speaker 2>win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to get so tired of winning.</v>

19
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.460
<v Speaker 2>You're going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mr.</v>

20
00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:01.750
<v Speaker 2>President,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please.</v>

21
00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.540
<v Speaker 2>We don't want to win anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's too much</v>

22
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:05.453
<v Speaker 1>evolved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump's advisors tasks with this charge </v>

23
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.133
<v Speaker 1>of winning for the American people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jared cushner is the most important but </v>

24
00:01:11.921 --> 00:01:12.754
<v Speaker 1>also the least understood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We simply don't know where he stands </v>

25
00:01:15.461 --> 00:01:17.680
<v Speaker 1>politically and there are a few reasons </v>
<v Speaker 1>for that.</v>

26
00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.000
<v Speaker 1>Kushner is only 36 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got no history in politics and it's</v>

27
00:01:22.001 --> 00:01:26.320
<v Speaker 1>clear that even two or three years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being a top advisor to the most powerful</v>

28
00:01:26.321 --> 00:01:29.230
<v Speaker 1>man in the world wasn't remotely on his </v>
<v Speaker 1>radar,</v>

29
00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:30.183
<v Speaker 1>is the last big project,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was buying this cluster of Brooklyn </v>

30
00:01:32.651 --> 00:01:37.540
<v Speaker 1>buildings from the Jehovah's Witnesses </v>
<v Speaker 1>in 2013 for 375 million in order to turn</v>

31
00:01:37.541 --> 00:01:39.640
<v Speaker 1>it into hipstery story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>office space,</v>

32
00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:41.260
<v Speaker 1>Kushner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Ivanka too,</v>

33
00:01:41.261 --> 00:01:42.094
<v Speaker 1>for that matter has always been a sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of hybrid of the left leaning hipster </v>

34
00:01:45.311 --> 00:01:48.790
<v Speaker 1>generation and the older mega rich </v>
<v Speaker 1>business elite.</v>

35
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.480
<v Speaker 1>Jared was certainly born into wealth and</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of it,</v>

36
00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.280
<v Speaker 1>but his family didn't start out that </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

37
00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.400
<v Speaker 1>Both his paternal grandparents were </v>
<v Speaker 1>Holocaust survivors,</v>

38
00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.590
<v Speaker 1>thankfully making it to the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>

39
00:01:59.591 --> 00:02:02.440
<v Speaker 1>In 1949 where Jerry's grandfather,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joseph,</v>

40
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.890
<v Speaker 1>a construction worker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>started building and managing New Jersey</v>

41
00:02:05.891 --> 00:02:07.240
<v Speaker 1>apartments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His son,</v>

42
00:02:07.241 --> 00:02:10.300
<v Speaker 1>jarrod's father Charles then started </v>
<v Speaker 1>acquiring real estate,</v>

43
00:02:10.301 --> 00:02:13.870
<v Speaker 1>turning cushner companies his business </v>
<v Speaker 1>into a billion dollar empire.</v>

44
00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.690
<v Speaker 1>This is the world that jared cushner </v>
<v Speaker 1>grew up in.</v>

45
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.890
<v Speaker 1>It was deeply religious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jarrod was brought up in modern Orthodox</v>

46
00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.020
<v Speaker 1>Judaism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>massively wealthy and privileged.</v>

47
00:02:23.021 --> 00:02:23.854
<v Speaker 1>Jared was conveniently accepted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hartford after his parents pledged two </v>

48
00:02:26.501 --> 00:02:27.334
<v Speaker 1>point $5,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the university and actually quite </v>

49
00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:31.413
<v Speaker 1>democratic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Charles cushner was one of the most </v>

50
00:02:33.221 --> 00:02:36.550
<v Speaker 1>prominent donors to democratic </v>
<v Speaker 1>politicians on the east coast.</v>

51
00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:37.623
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was the largest single donor to the </v>

52
00:02:39.161 --> 00:02:42.400
<v Speaker 1>2000 New York Senate campaign of Hillary</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clinton,</v>

53
00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.430
<v Speaker 1>and then things came apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Jersey based developer,</v>

54
00:02:48.431 --> 00:02:53.431
<v Speaker 1>Charles cushner is charged with hiring a</v>
<v Speaker 1>prostitute to blackmail to witnesses and</v>

55
00:02:53.981 --> 00:02:56.410
<v Speaker 1>a federal investigation where he is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>target.</v>

56
00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.010
<v Speaker 1>Charles conviction was deeply traumatic </v>
<v Speaker 1>for charit as of course,</v>

57
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.070
<v Speaker 1>it would be a checkup his entire life </v>
<v Speaker 1>and not just emotionally,</v>

58
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.220
<v Speaker 1>but professionally too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the age of 24,</v>

59
00:03:06.221 --> 00:03:09.540
<v Speaker 1>Jerry took over the massive empire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his father bill,</v>

60
00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:10.763
<v Speaker 1>and he wasted little time making a </v>
<v Speaker 1>splash of his own in 2007 cushner </v>

61
00:03:14.381 --> 00:03:16.280
<v Speaker 1>companies bought an office building at </v>
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>

62
00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.123
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six fifth avenue in Manhattan for one </v>

63
00:03:18.791 --> 00:03:20.290
<v Speaker 1>point $8,</v>
<v Speaker 1>billion dollars,</v>

64
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.890
<v Speaker 1>the most expensive single building </v>
<v Speaker 1>purchase in US history.</v>

65
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.340
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was really bad timing.</v>

66
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.400
<v Speaker 1>A year later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the economy collapsed and six,</v>

67
00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:30.243
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six is not been able to generate enough </v>

68
00:03:31.601 --> 00:03:34.810
<v Speaker 1>money for Kushner companies to pay off </v>
<v Speaker 1>the debt even today.</v>

69
00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.480
<v Speaker 1>But despite that setback,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cushner kept at it.</v>

70
00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:38.343
<v Speaker 1>He kept making deals or trying to like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the trendy tech office space in </v>

71
00:03:41.231 --> 00:03:42.064
<v Speaker 1>Brooklyn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's clear that he's focused and driven </v>

72
00:03:44.351 --> 00:03:45.184
<v Speaker 1>and ambitious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a success or failure in real estate </v>

73
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.060
<v Speaker 1>tells us preciously little about where </v>
<v Speaker 1>his mindset politically,</v>

74
00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:53.231
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for all I know,</v>

75
00:03:53.231 --> 00:03:56.740
<v Speaker 1>he could still sympathize with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>democratic values that his father funded</v>

76
00:03:56.741 --> 00:03:57.574
<v Speaker 1>so generously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but truth is Christian or seems a bit </v>

77
00:03:59.621 --> 00:04:00.454
<v Speaker 1>out of place in the conservative </v>
<v Speaker 1>populist nationalist White House of </v>

78
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.993
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump.</v>

79
00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.720
<v Speaker 1>Until you account for two things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>

80
00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.820
<v Speaker 1>his loyalty to family cushner always </v>
<v Speaker 1>sticks by his own.</v>

81
00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:15.430
<v Speaker 1>When his father was put away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't abandon him,</v>

82
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.980
<v Speaker 1>and when trump retweeted wittingly or </v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

83
00:04:17.981 --> 00:04:20.830
<v Speaker 1>some antisemitic imagery alongside a </v>
<v Speaker 1>picture of Hillary Clinton,</v>

84
00:04:20.831 --> 00:04:21.960
<v Speaker 1>last summer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cushing,</v>

85
00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:22.843
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote an op Ed defending him in the New </v>

86
00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.860
<v Speaker 1>York Observer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the newspaper that he owns.</v>

87
00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.670
<v Speaker 1>That's the second place to look for </v>
<v Speaker 1>hints of Kush nurse politics,</v>

88
00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.893
<v Speaker 1>The Observer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was here that he developed a </v>

89
00:04:33.161 --> 00:04:36.100
<v Speaker 1>friendship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even a mentorship with Rupert Murdoch,</v>

90
00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.790
<v Speaker 1>the media magnate and owner of Fox News,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Murdoch counsel,</v>

91
00:04:39.791 --> 00:04:40.624
<v Speaker 1>jared gave him advice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sent over books by prominent </v>

92
00:04:42.341 --> 00:04:43.174
<v Speaker 1>conservative thinkers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And soon the paper began to take on a </v>

93
00:04:45.521 --> 00:04:46.354
<v Speaker 1>more right wing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then some say cushner even had a </v>

94
00:04:48.431 --> 00:04:49.264
<v Speaker 1>vindictive streak using the paper to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>after people who wronged him or his </v>

95
00:04:52.331 --> 00:04:53.350
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

96
00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.270
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New York attorney general,</v>

97
00:04:55.271 --> 00:04:58.480
<v Speaker 1>Eric Schneiderman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who investigated trump university.</v>

98
00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:59.643
<v Speaker 1>The headpiece of the observer published </v>
<v Speaker 1>on Schneiderman is almost comical in </v>

99
00:05:02.051 --> 00:05:02.884
<v Speaker 1>it's defense of trump scam school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people saw this same </v>

100
00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:06.993
<v Speaker 1>vindictiveness in the ouster of Chris </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christie from trump's transition team </v>

101
00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:11.800
<v Speaker 1>last December.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christie,</v>

102
00:05:11.801 --> 00:05:12.634
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was the man who sent jerrod's father to </v>

103
00:05:15.041 --> 00:05:15.874
<v Speaker 1>jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr Kushner engaged in a conspiracy with </v>

104
00:05:18.701 --> 00:05:22.750
<v Speaker 1>co-conspirators.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a hire prostitutes.</v>

105
00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:23.703
<v Speaker 1>This period is where cushner may have </v>
<v Speaker 1>begun to acquire more conservative </v>

106
00:05:27.041 --> 00:05:29.620
<v Speaker 1>values,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I have to be fair and say that these</v>

107
00:05:29.621 --> 00:05:32.650
<v Speaker 1>are just inklings of what may be in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>

108
00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:34.900
<v Speaker 1>He barely ever puts things on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>record.</v>

109
00:05:34.901 --> 00:05:39.640
<v Speaker 1>He barely ever speaks to the media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we do know is that today cushner is</v>

110
00:05:39.641 --> 00:05:43.390
<v Speaker 1>overseeing a laundry list of things in </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump's administration,</v>

111
00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:46.510
<v Speaker 1>including heading the new office of </v>
<v Speaker 1>American innovation,</v>

112
00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:49.600
<v Speaker 1>being the key liaison for diplomats from</v>
<v Speaker 1>China,</v>

113
00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:51.700
<v Speaker 1>Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a dozen other countries,</v>

114
00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:52.773
<v Speaker 1>and of course there's this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can produce peace in the Middle </v>

115
00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:57.873
<v Speaker 1>East,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody can.</v>

116
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.980
<v Speaker 1>In most things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump and Kushner are opposites.</v>

117
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:04.250
<v Speaker 1>One is loud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>easily distracted and media obsessed.</v>

118
00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:08.630
<v Speaker 1>The other is understated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>focused and media allergic,</v>

119
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:09.733
<v Speaker 1>but they both trust family and trump </v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely trusts jared cushner for </v>

120
00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:17.090
<v Speaker 1>president with such little grasp on </v>
<v Speaker 1>policy and detail.</v>

121
00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:18.283
<v Speaker 1>That means jared cushner might just be </v>
<v Speaker 1>the most influential person in the </v>

122
00:06:21.801 --> 00:06:22.634
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

<v Speaker 1>more about what people leaves.</v>

124
00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:31.970
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this couch is so comfortable.</v>
