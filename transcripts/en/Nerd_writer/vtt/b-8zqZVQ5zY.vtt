1
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:13.763
<v Speaker 1>Here we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody loves a good movie and the </v>

2
00:00:16.981 --> 00:00:21.981
<v Speaker 1>genre has a lot of competition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got John Hughes classics like the</v>

3
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.290
<v Speaker 1>Breakfast Club and Ferris Bueller's day </v>
<v Speaker 1>off nineties,</v>

4
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.130
<v Speaker 1>teen romcoms like 10 things I hate about</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and she's all that Richard Linklater</v>

5
00:00:29.131 --> 00:00:30.150
<v Speaker 1>is coming of age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy,</v>

6
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.950
<v Speaker 1>dazed and confused or recent hits like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fault in our stars and love Simon.</v>

7
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.340
<v Speaker 1>You could even throw all eight Harry </v>
<v Speaker 1>Potter movies into the mix.</v>

8
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.980
<v Speaker 1>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when I search [inaudible] dot com,</v>

9
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.030
<v Speaker 1>which everybody knows is the authority </v>
<v Speaker 1>on ranking stuff.</v>

10
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.893
<v Speaker 1>I'm disappointed to find that my </v>
<v Speaker 1>favorite teen movie doesn't even crack </v>

11
00:00:48.751 --> 00:00:52.200
<v Speaker 1>the top 100.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course I'm talking about Kenji Ecosoc</v>

12
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.900
<v Speaker 1>whose turn of the millennium </v>
<v Speaker 1>masterpiece.</v>

13
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.590
<v Speaker 1>That.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

14
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.423
<v Speaker 2>Boy,</v>

15
00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:06.970
<v Speaker 1>premise of battle royale is really </v>
<v Speaker 1>simple.</v>

16
00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.900
<v Speaker 1>In a dystopian Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a classroom of teenagers is chosen every</v>

17
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:11.733
<v Speaker 1>year and shipped to an island where they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to fight to the death until only </v>

18
00:01:14.801 --> 00:01:15.634
<v Speaker 1>one is left standing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might recognize this premise from </v>

19
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.933
<v Speaker 1>the hunger games books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first of which came out eight years </v>

20
00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:22.413
<v Speaker 1>after battle royale and nine years after</v>
<v Speaker 1>the book by cashew into Cami on which </v>

21
00:01:26.591 --> 00:01:27.424
<v Speaker 1>it's based.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This concept is also the basis for the </v>

22
00:01:29.471 --> 00:01:30.304
<v Speaker 1>hugely popular video game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fortnight battle royale and its </v>

23
00:01:33.191 --> 00:01:35.440
<v Speaker 1>predecessor player unknown's </v>
<v Speaker 1>battlegrounds,</v>

24
00:01:35.441 --> 00:01:39.100
<v Speaker 1>which was at least in part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inspired by Fuka sock who's moving.</v>

25
00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.450
<v Speaker 1>Unlike the hunger games,</v>
<v Speaker 1>battle royale is remarkably contained.</v>

26
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.780
<v Speaker 1>There is no larger world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no political intrigue,</v>

27
00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:47.683
<v Speaker 1>plotline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The audience is just dumped into this </v>

28
00:01:49.241 --> 00:01:50.074
<v Speaker 1>horrific situation with the characters </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we experience it shocks as they do </v>

29
00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.000
<v Speaker 1>and they are shocked.</v>

30
00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.053
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely a violent movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's the execution of violence that </v>

31
00:02:06.271 --> 00:02:07.104
<v Speaker 1>makes battle royale so great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this should come as no surprise </v>

32
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:10.703
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know this when I first saw the </v>

33
00:02:11.611 --> 00:02:12.444
<v Speaker 1>movie at Summer Camp Age Sixteen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Battle Royale is the final film of </v>

34
00:02:16.471 --> 00:02:17.304
<v Speaker 1>Japanese alter Kinji Fuka soccer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He made this incredibly vigorous film </v>

35
00:02:22.261 --> 00:02:25.860
<v Speaker 1>about teenagers at age 70,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is amazing,</v>

36
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.350
<v Speaker 1>but by then focus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aco was a master,</v>

37
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.490
<v Speaker 1>a criminally underappreciated master of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Japanese in world cinema.</v>

38
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:33.593
<v Speaker 1>He made his mark on the industry in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>19 seventies with a breathtaking series </v>

39
00:02:37.171 --> 00:02:38.004
<v Speaker 1>of films about Japanese gangsters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Yakuza in the chaos after World War </v>

40
00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.083
<v Speaker 1>II.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unlike the more traditional Yakuza </v>

41
00:02:44.101 --> 00:02:44.934
<v Speaker 1>films,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuka Socceroos movies have a wild manic </v>

42
00:02:47.401 --> 00:02:50.370
<v Speaker 1>energy to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The camera work is designed to throw you</v>

43
00:02:50.371 --> 00:02:52.020
<v Speaker 1>into the action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a thrilling,</v>

44
00:02:52.021 --> 00:02:52.854
<v Speaker 1>disorienting experience to watch them </v>
<v Speaker 1>and whose message in those films comes </v>

45
00:02:56.581 --> 00:03:00.430
<v Speaker 1>through loud and clear in a society by </v>
<v Speaker 1>war,</v>

46
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:01.690
<v Speaker 1>friendship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comradery.</v>

47
00:03:01.691 --> 00:03:06.040
<v Speaker 1>Even the famous codes of honor of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Coosa only stretch so far.</v>

48
00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:11.020
<v Speaker 1>It was truly every man for himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if someone could get an advantage by</v>

49
00:03:11.021 --> 00:03:14.650
<v Speaker 1>betraying his friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was more likely to do it than not.</v>

50
00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.923
<v Speaker 1>It took a sack whose films?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The honorable ones are often the first </v>

51
00:03:18.641 --> 00:03:19.474
<v Speaker 1>to be killed.</v>

52
00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he killed him.</v>

53
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.700
<v Speaker 3>Him have to be in a custody can you </v>
<v Speaker 3>highlight one night every night</v>

54
00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:34.003
<v Speaker 1>in battle royale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same philosophy holds in the chaos </v>

55
00:03:36.561 --> 00:03:37.394
<v Speaker 1>of the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The speed at which friends turn into </v>

56
00:03:39.021 --> 00:03:42.110
<v Speaker 1>enemies can give you whiplash and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>violence,</v>

57
00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.790
<v Speaker 1>the violence of the films is sudden </v>
<v Speaker 1>devastate.</v>

58
00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.870
<v Speaker 1>As a viewer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're one of the students.</v>

59
00:03:47.871 --> 00:03:48.704
<v Speaker 1>It all comes so fast at the beginning </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you just want to pause and get a </v>

60
00:03:51.441 --> 00:03:53.990
<v Speaker 1>grip on things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's no time for them.</v>

61
00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.770
<v Speaker 1>The ones who trust too liberally are the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ones who get killed.</v>

62
00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:58.753
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it may seem like battle royale is a </v>

63
00:04:00.411 --> 00:04:04.310
<v Speaker 1>fable of nihilism with mindless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brutal killing,</v>

64
00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:05.173
<v Speaker 1>doled out to anyone and everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the violence in [inaudible] whose </v>

65
00:04:08.481 --> 00:04:11.900
<v Speaker 1>vision has a purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like all great team movies,</v>

66
00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:16.990
<v Speaker 1>Battle Royale is really about </v>
<v Speaker 1>friendships that may be a little hard to</v>

67
00:04:21.321 --> 00:04:22.154
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but focus on who's interested in what </v>

68
00:04:23.721 --> 00:04:24.554
<v Speaker 1>friendship really means when the gloves </v>
<v Speaker 1>are off in the most barbaric </v>

69
00:04:28.221 --> 00:04:29.054
<v Speaker 1>circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does human connection mean in the </v>

70
00:04:31.251 --> 00:04:35.780
<v Speaker 1>context of humanity's capacity for </v>
<v Speaker 1>unspeakable violence?</v>

71
00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.980
<v Speaker 1>At that time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unspeakable violence was very much alive</v>

72
00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.590
<v Speaker 1>in the memory of the older generation in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Japan.</v>

73
00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.810
<v Speaker 1>It tested them in ways that the younger </v>
<v Speaker 1>generation couldn't begin to understand.</v>

74
00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:51.920
<v Speaker 1>This is what life was like for fruit </v>
<v Speaker 1>soco himself when he was 15,</v>

75
00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:53.780
<v Speaker 1>the same age as the students in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>film,</v>

76
00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:59.010
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>

77
00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.943
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was really not that much data on my </v>

78
00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.010
<v Speaker 2>level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You Eel know.</v>

79
00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to look that up?</v>

80
00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:23.370
<v Speaker 2>So do you want your pillows</v>

81
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.833
<v Speaker 1>in the movie?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost as if the older generation </v>

82
00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:28.563
<v Speaker 1>represented by a teacher devices the </v>
<v Speaker 1>game as a way to communicate their </v>

83
00:05:33.101 --> 00:05:33.934
<v Speaker 1>experiences with the youth and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost as if he made the film for the </v>

84
00:05:38.861 --> 00:05:39.694
<v Speaker 1>same reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Battle Royale is interested in the kind </v>

85
00:05:41.891 --> 00:05:45.190
<v Speaker 1>of friendship that can't be explored at </v>
<v Speaker 1>high school.</v>

86
00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:49.060
<v Speaker 1>It's friendship tainted by a deeply </v>
<v Speaker 1>cruel world,</v>

87
00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:54.070
<v Speaker 1>but it's all the more poignant when it </v>
<v Speaker 1>persists in spite of that fact.</v>

88
00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.470
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael saw sick idea.</v>

89
00:06:02.471 --> 00:06:07.471
<v Speaker 1>It's about the last movie is a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

90
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.950
<v Speaker 1>It's Blackley comical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's scary.</v>

91
00:06:15.951 --> 00:06:20.570
<v Speaker 1>It's a naked look at humanity and it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>gripping piece of balls to the wall.</v>

92
00:06:20.571 --> 00:06:25.550
<v Speaker 1>Entertainment directed by a man with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lifetime of skill and experience.</v>

93
00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:27.133
<v Speaker 1>It's a teen movie and it deserves to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>considered with the very best of that </v>

94
00:06:30.981 --> 00:06:31.814
<v Speaker 1>genre.</v>

95
00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:43.380
<v Speaker 1>Hey everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you so much for watching.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

100
00:06:56.011 --> 00:06:59.220
<v Speaker 1>I learned photoshop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I learned it through a weird mishmash of</v>

101
00:06:59.221 --> 00:07:03.060
<v Speaker 1>disconnected youtube videos and I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>the process would have gone a lot faster</v>

102
00:07:03.061 --> 00:07:06.510
<v Speaker 1>and better if there was a class </v>
<v Speaker 1>dedicated to teaching me everything that</v>

103
00:07:06.511 --> 00:07:09.060
<v Speaker 1>program could do in a more systematic </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's like a bunch of new ideas are </v>
