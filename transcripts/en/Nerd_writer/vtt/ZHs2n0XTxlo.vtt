00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:04.540
<v Speaker 1>When I was growing up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nintendo was</v>

2
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.290
<v Speaker 2>the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the original nes console,</v>

3
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.030
<v Speaker 2>Super Mario Legend of Zelda metroid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mike Tyson's punch out battle toads.</v>

4
00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:17.030
<v Speaker 2>Then we got into Sega and all things </v>
<v Speaker 2>sonic.</v>

5
00:00:17.031 --> 00:00:20.630
<v Speaker 2>Then Super Nintendo came out and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>played a lot of donkey Kong country,</v>

6
00:00:20.631 --> 00:00:25.631
<v Speaker 2>Aladdin and turtles and time Nintendo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sixty four was a revelation Mario,</v>

7
00:00:26.001 --> 00:00:29.090
<v Speaker 2>64 Mario Kart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lesser known but still great.</v>

8
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.070
<v Speaker 2>Diddy Kong racing and of course the </v>
<v Speaker 2>masterpiece of masterpieces,</v>

9
00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.250
<v Speaker 2>awkward arena of time for many kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My generation and after video games were</v>

10
00:00:37.251 --> 00:00:39.140
<v Speaker 2>just a part of growing up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>After school,</v>

11
00:00:39.141 --> 00:00:39.974
<v Speaker 2>I'd go to one of my friend's houses and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd play 64 or second saturn for a few </v>

12
00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:44.361
<v Speaker 2>hours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go outside,</v>

13
00:00:44.361 --> 00:00:45.830
<v Speaker 2>run around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>play some more,</v>

14
00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.843
<v Speaker 2>go home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We played video games because it was </v>

15
00:00:48.141 --> 00:00:51.820
<v Speaker 2>something to do like playing horse in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the driveway or Walpole.</v>

16
00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.570
<v Speaker 2>It was just another form of competition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The pure competition of games,</v>

17
00:00:56.571 --> 00:01:00.140
<v Speaker 2>which is just a way of filling free time</v>
<v Speaker 2>with purpose.</v>

18
00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.003
<v Speaker 2>The last console I ever owned was </v>
<v Speaker 2>playstation two and I fell off gaming </v>

19
00:01:04.791 --> 00:01:05.624
<v Speaker 2>when gaming got much more complicated </v>
<v Speaker 2>than the side scrolling that I grew up </v>

20
00:01:09.261 --> 00:01:09.430
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>

21
00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.460
<v Speaker 2>If at that time you would've asked me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can video games be art?</v>

22
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.200
<v Speaker 2>I would have said I'm 13.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do I know?</v>

23
00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.220
<v Speaker 2>My opinion on it now is that those games</v>
<v Speaker 2>were games.</v>

24
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.113
<v Speaker 2>The objectives were clear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rules relatively simple like soccer </v>

25
00:01:23.061 --> 00:01:23.894
<v Speaker 2>or basketball or any other sport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The primary purpose of the experience </v>

26
00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.853
<v Speaker 2>was to win in the period.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Since Games have become vastly more </v>

27
00:01:31.761 --> 00:01:32.594
<v Speaker 2>complicated and the question of whether </v>
<v Speaker 2>or not that form is an art of fine art </v>

28
00:01:36.411 --> 00:01:40.190
<v Speaker 2>has become the topic of serious </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophical debate legally.</v>

29
00:01:40.191 --> 00:01:41.024
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that decision was decided on much more </v>

30
00:01:42.531 --> 00:01:43.364
<v Speaker 2>specific terms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It started in the early eighties when a </v>

31
00:01:45.591 --> 00:01:46.424
<v Speaker 2>series of American court decisions found</v>
<v Speaker 2>that video games could not be covered </v>

32
00:01:49.791 --> 00:01:50.624
<v Speaker 2>under arts free speech protections </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they were no more expressive </v>

33
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.033
<v Speaker 2>than pinball or chest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those precedents determine much of what </v>

34
00:01:57.951 --> 00:01:58.784
<v Speaker 2>followed in 2002 federal judge Steven </v>
<v Speaker 2>Limbo ruled against the protection of </v>

35
00:02:02.511 --> 00:02:02.760
<v Speaker 2>games.</v>

36
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.950
<v Speaker 2>Saying that like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bingo,</v>

37
00:02:03.951 --> 00:02:07.100
<v Speaker 2>the court fails to see how video games </v>
<v Speaker 2>express ideas,</v>

38
00:02:07.101 --> 00:02:08.300
<v Speaker 2>impressions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>feelings,</v>

39
00:02:08.301 --> 00:02:11.240
<v Speaker 2>or information unrelated to the game </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>

40
00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:12.103
<v Speaker 2>Not until 2011 the matter get the </v>
<v Speaker 2>definitive decision that it deserved </v>

41
00:02:15.381 --> 00:02:20.381
<v Speaker 2>when the Supreme Court finally extended </v>
<v Speaker 2>arts protections to video games in Brown</v>

42
00:02:20.991 --> 00:02:25.010
<v Speaker 2>vs the entertainment Merchants </v>
<v Speaker 2>Association in a seven to two rule,</v>

43
00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.970
<v Speaker 2>and of course the legal definition of </v>
<v Speaker 2>video game stands quite apart from their</v>

44
00:02:28.971 --> 00:02:32.870
<v Speaker 2>philosophical definition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in the time span of all those little</v>

45
00:02:32.871 --> 00:02:36.470
<v Speaker 2>decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the scope of video games has expanded to</v>

46
00:02:36.471 --> 00:02:39.410
<v Speaker 2>include things like missed grand theft </v>
<v Speaker 2>auto,</v>

47
00:02:39.411 --> 00:02:40.244
<v Speaker 2>the Sims,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rpgs with narratives more compelling </v>

48
00:02:43.011 --> 00:02:46.700
<v Speaker 2>than most science fiction in Hollywood </v>
<v Speaker 2>or contemporary literature.</v>

49
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:47.563
<v Speaker 2>Games today have real and fully realized</v>
<v Speaker 2>economies like the one which was shaken </v>

50
00:02:51.651 --> 00:02:52.484
<v Speaker 2>to its core in eve online when this mega</v>
<v Speaker 2>space battle from earlier this year </v>

51
00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.970
<v Speaker 2>destroyed endgame spaceships to the of </v>
<v Speaker 2>300,000</v>

52
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.430
<v Speaker 2>real dollars and visually.</v>

53
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.263
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you can get more </v>
<v Speaker 2>digitally sophisticated than the </v>

54
00:03:06.401 --> 00:03:10.240
<v Speaker 2>cinematics for games like Batman Arkham </v>
<v Speaker 2>asylum or elder scrolls.</v>

55
00:03:10.241 --> 00:03:11.074
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you can find an </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience more elegant than the </v>

56
00:03:13.661 --> 00:03:17.170
<v Speaker 2>Gameplay for Super Mario Galaxy or feds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do.</v>

57
00:03:17.171 --> 00:03:20.440
<v Speaker 2>All of these things complex as they are </v>
<v Speaker 2>at up to art.</v>

58
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:21.663
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the core of this is the question of </v>

59
00:03:22.571 --> 00:03:23.404
<v Speaker 2>whether something that must be </v>
<v Speaker 2>categorized as a game can also be </v>

60
00:03:26.711 --> 00:03:31.630
<v Speaker 2>categorized as a work of art to be sure </v>
<v Speaker 2>all kinds of artistic expression involve</v>

61
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.450
<v Speaker 2>some interaction with the source </v>
<v Speaker 2>material,</v>

62
00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:35.343
<v Speaker 2>but is the physical interaction in </v>
<v Speaker 2>gaming of some kind of qualitatively </v>

63
00:03:39.311 --> 00:03:40.144
<v Speaker 2>disqualifying kind?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always been a stickler for </v>

64
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.993
<v Speaker 2>distinctions for philosophical labels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's questions like this that make </v>

65
00:03:46.091 --> 00:03:46.924
<v Speaker 2>me think about why people are very </v>
<v Speaker 2>precious about art and they try to </v>

66
00:03:50.591 --> 00:03:51.424
<v Speaker 2>include all the things they love under </v>
<v Speaker 2>its masthead like advertising or </v>

67
00:03:54.911 --> 00:03:55.744
<v Speaker 2>cooking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to me the desperate attempt to have </v>

68
00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.790
<v Speaker 2>games included in the art speaks less to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the significance of the category of art.</v>

69
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:04.293
<v Speaker 2>Then the curious lack of significance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We attach in comparison to the category </v>

70
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:09.333
<v Speaker 2>of games.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The extraordinary injection of subtlety </v>

71
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:12.633
<v Speaker 2>and beauty into the universe of video </v>
<v Speaker 2>games seems to me a herald of what </v>

72
00:04:16.511 --> 00:04:20.380
<v Speaker 2>gaming can and will be to us in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>future.</v>

73
00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:21.603
<v Speaker 2>In the 2012 game called journey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you play as a rope to figure in the </v>

74
00:04:25.031 --> 00:04:26.500
<v Speaker 2>desert,</v>
<v Speaker 2>moving slowly,</v>

75
00:04:26.501 --> 00:04:29.950
<v Speaker 2>gracefully wordlessly toward a shining </v>
<v Speaker 2>mountains in the distance.</v>

76
00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:31.473
<v Speaker 2>The goal is singular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but gradually informed by traces on the </v>

77
00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:38.260
<v Speaker 2>faded civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you discover along the way the game</v>

78
00:04:38.261 --> 00:04:39.094
<v Speaker 2>play the music,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the symbolism of the culture that was </v>

79
00:04:40.841 --> 00:04:45.760
<v Speaker 2>lost puts you in an emotional space,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unique to all other forms of media.</v>

80
00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:48.063
<v Speaker 2>Reaching the mountain is like an </v>
<v Speaker 2>apotheosis and like the apotheosis of </v>

81
00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:52.323
<v Speaker 2>art.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is the kind that life itself is it </v>

82
00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:55.373
<v Speaker 2>capable of sustaining.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Contained in this game is a meditation </v>

83
00:04:59.981 --> 00:05:00.814
<v Speaker 2>both on the unspoiled image of what we </v>
<v Speaker 2>want and it's profound unsatisfactories </v>

84
00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.200
<v Speaker 2>reflection,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we thought.</v>

85
00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:13.370
<v Speaker 2>Fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For Video Games,</v>

86
00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:31.863
<v Speaker 2>thanks for watching and allowing a sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of non game or to take part in this </v>

87
00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.823
<v Speaker 2>really fascinating discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still do play Mario Cart on a regular </v>

88
00:05:39.581 --> 00:05:40.810
<v Speaker 2>basis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that should give me something.</v>

89
