00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:02.353
<v Speaker 1>Hm,</v>

2
00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:13.363
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're somewhere in the catskill </v>

3
00:00:14.181 --> 00:00:16.360
<v Speaker 2>mountains.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know exactly where we're at.</v>

4
00:00:16.361 --> 00:00:19.840
<v Speaker 2>Hudson stone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is round tot.</v>

5
00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.580
<v Speaker 2>We're going out to film the Russian </v>
<v Speaker 2>movie right now.</v>

6
00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm playing a Russian mob boss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

7
00:00:24.141 --> 00:00:25.310
<v Speaker 2>that's a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>

8
00:00:25.311 --> 00:00:25.971
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>

9
00:00:25.971 --> 00:00:26.541
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look.</v>

10
00:00:26.541 --> 00:00:28.850
<v Speaker 2>That strange thing is not having </v>
<v Speaker 2>Internet,</v>

11
00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.350
<v Speaker 2>not having Internet because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>extremely isolating.</v>

12
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.460
<v Speaker 2>You've been away from it for a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>while.</v>

13
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.993
<v Speaker 2>What are those walls?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're original property markers that </v>

14
00:00:44.361 --> 00:00:48.200
<v Speaker 2>Dutch settlers built in the 16 hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't.</v>

15
00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.600
<v Speaker 2>They aren't used now like our property </v>
<v Speaker 2>lines are on paper.</v>

16
00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:59.413
<v Speaker 2>The faithful crossing archive has been </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing this for thousands of years and </v>

17
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.030
<v Speaker 2>you can do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is all green underneath the stair,</v>

18
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:11.473
<v Speaker 2>but it's just froze.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the destination that we're going </v>

19
00:01:21.041 --> 00:01:26.041
<v Speaker 2>to go going down there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

20
00:01:28.291 --> 00:01:29.124
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

21
00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.903
<v Speaker 3>You went in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No fear for this gentleman is </v>

22
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.530
<v Speaker 3>inspiration to all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really not going to go back up because</v>

23
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:59.150
<v Speaker 2>nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>After being in the city for a long time,</v>

24
00:02:01.571 --> 00:02:04.630
<v Speaker 2>you get used to buildings and activity </v>
<v Speaker 2>and all that stuff here,</v>

25
00:02:04.631 --> 00:02:05.464
<v Speaker 2>so it's sort of shocking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a stunning feeling to be in </v>

26
00:02:08.531 --> 00:02:09.364
<v Speaker 2>silence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we all need to change </v>

27
00:02:10.661 --> 00:02:11.494
<v Speaker 2>environments every once in a while,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just so that we can get out of our own </v>

28
00:02:12.941 --> 00:02:14.170
<v Speaker 2>heads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

29
00:02:14.171 --> 00:02:15.610
<v Speaker 2>this is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a wonderful place.</v>

30
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.913
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

31
00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:26.563
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

32
00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.940
<v Speaker 4>His practice was my grandfather and </v>
<v Speaker 4>grandmother.</v>

33
00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:34.623
<v Speaker 4>That's so nice.</v>

34
00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.300
<v Speaker 1>Mild winter for when it's not too cold.</v>
