00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:07.320
<v Speaker 1>The Art of performing magic is really </v>
<v Speaker 1>the art of managing attention up here.</v>

2
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.590
<v Speaker 1>Look at the car at three to three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

3
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:13.120
<v Speaker 1>three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>

4
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.213
<v Speaker 1>The general rule of thumb is that when a</v>
<v Speaker 1>magician says that something doesn't </v>

5
00:00:16.781 --> 00:00:19.420
<v Speaker 1>matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the opposite is usually true.</v>

6
00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:20.283
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple of minutes ago when David </v>

7
00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:22.893
<v Speaker 1>Blaine flipped three more cards into </v>
<v Speaker 1>what everyone else thinks is a pile of </v>

8
00:00:25.751 --> 00:00:26.584
<v Speaker 1>10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then asked to read to put them over his </v>

9
00:00:27.911 --> 00:00:28.744
<v Speaker 1>heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only thing that matters is that </v>

10
00:00:30.941 --> 00:00:31.774
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy Fallon chooses the number three </v>
<v Speaker 1>from this forced flourish so that when </v>

11
00:00:34.841 --> 00:00:35.674
<v Speaker 1>Blaine says that three cards will </v>
<v Speaker 1>magically fly from his deck into creeks </v>

12
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.933
<v Speaker 1>hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 13 cards will be there and everyone </v>

13
00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.270
<v Speaker 1>will freak out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 zero.</v>

14
00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.030
<v Speaker 1>Did you catch it that time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ten,</v>

15
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.973
<v Speaker 1>10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>zero.</v>

16
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.440
<v Speaker 1>There's three and there's four more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there's 20 cards.</v>

17
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:06.803
<v Speaker 1>This is a great trick from David Blaine </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it functions on a simple concept </v>

18
00:01:09.841 --> 00:01:13.470
<v Speaker 1>which all magic depends on selective </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>

19
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.270
<v Speaker 1>The idea that the eyes and the mind can </v>
<v Speaker 1>only focus on one thing at a time.</v>

20
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:19.343
<v Speaker 1>This principle is something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>magicians have known for centuries in </v>

21
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.360
<v Speaker 1>the earliest known book of Magic and </v>
<v Speaker 1>English Hocus pocus.</v>

22
00:01:24.361 --> 00:01:29.190
<v Speaker 1>The author includes in his four required</v>
<v Speaker 1>skills for magic tricks such gestures of</v>

23
00:01:29.191 --> 00:01:30.024
<v Speaker 1>body as may lead the spectators eyes </v>
<v Speaker 1>from a strict and diligent beholding of </v>

24
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.270
<v Speaker 1>his manner of conveyance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A few hundred years later,</v>

25
00:01:36.271 --> 00:01:37.104
<v Speaker 1>scientists began conducting tests on </v>
<v Speaker 1>selective attention like this one from </v>

26
00:01:40.471 --> 00:01:44.250
<v Speaker 1>deckland serve owned from 1983,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which asked subjects to count the number</v>

27
00:01:44.251 --> 00:01:45.084
<v Speaker 1>of times the white shirted players pass </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ball back and forth and this in </v>

28
00:01:48.241 --> 00:01:50.130
<v Speaker 1>other tests like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A majority of people,</v>

29
00:01:50.131 --> 00:01:50.964
<v Speaker 1>more than half fail to see the woman </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the umbrella walking directly </v>

30
00:01:54.661 --> 00:01:56.280
<v Speaker 1>through the middle of the scene.</v>

31
00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.263
<v Speaker 1>The important thing to note is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>selected the tension is something that </v>

32
00:01:59.311 --> 00:02:02.100
<v Speaker 1>organizes our entire experience as human</v>
<v Speaker 1>beings,</v>

33
00:02:02.101 --> 00:02:03.810
<v Speaker 1>not just our vision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

34
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.290
<v Speaker 1>David Blaine may be distracting Jimmy </v>
<v Speaker 1>Fallon and the roots when he loads these</v>

35
00:02:07.291 --> 00:02:08.124
<v Speaker 1>extra cards into the pile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what's more amazing than the slight </v>

36
00:02:10.381 --> 00:02:11.214
<v Speaker 1>of hand is that he's doing it in exactly</v>
<v Speaker 1>the place where everyone is looking and </v>

37
00:02:15.511 --> 00:02:19.980
<v Speaker 1>this shows just how powerful selective </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention can be in magic.</v>

38
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.920
<v Speaker 1>Manipulating attention is fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's what we expect,</v>

39
00:02:22.921 --> 00:02:25.950
<v Speaker 1>but it's not the only place we find this</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of activity.</v>

40
00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.540
<v Speaker 1>Let's take a look at another trick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you watching closely on Sunday,</v>

41
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:31.403
<v Speaker 1>November 27th,</v>
<v Speaker 1>The New York Times published a </v>

42
00:02:32.971 --> 00:02:36.780
<v Speaker 1>comprehensive piece of good journalism </v>
<v Speaker 1>detailing country by country,</v>

43
00:02:36.781 --> 00:02:37.614
<v Speaker 1>the empire of business interests that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald trump has around the globe and </v>

44
00:02:41.101 --> 00:02:43.800
<v Speaker 1>how they might conflict with his job as </v>
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>

45
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.200
<v Speaker 1>The story was at the top of the front </v>
<v Speaker 1>page.</v>

46
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.460
<v Speaker 1>Then at around 1230 that afternoon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump tweeted this,</v>

47
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.000
<v Speaker 1>in addition to winning the electoral </v>
<v Speaker 1>college in a landslide,</v>

48
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.900
<v Speaker 1>I won the popular vote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you deduct the millions of people who</v>

49
00:02:57.901 --> 00:03:00.400
<v Speaker 1>voted illegally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make no mistake.</v>

50
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.460
<v Speaker 1>This is a kind of magic trick like David</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blaine,</v>

51
00:03:03.461 --> 00:03:04.294
<v Speaker 1>like any magician,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump is using selective </v>

52
00:03:06.401 --> 00:03:07.234
<v Speaker 1>attention for his own gain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's misdirecting sucking all the air </v>

53
00:03:10.361 --> 00:03:12.130
<v Speaker 1>out of a story that he wants you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>forget.</v>

54
00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.313
<v Speaker 1>Mr [inaudible] is not new to politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Politicians have been manipulating our </v>

55
00:03:15.851 --> 00:03:16.684
<v Speaker 1>attention for years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean when the public asks a question </v>

56
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.560
<v Speaker 1>politicians figured out long ago that </v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than actually answer it,</v>

57
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.130
<v Speaker 1>it's much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much better to change the question.</v>

58
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.410
<v Speaker 1>When you address negative publicity on </v>
<v Speaker 1>its own terms,</v>

59
00:03:29.411 --> 00:03:31.480
<v Speaker 1>you end up with stuff like this.</v>

60
00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.590
<v Speaker 2>People have got to know whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 2>their president is a crook.</v>

61
00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.090
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a crook.</v>

62
00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.670
<v Speaker 2>I earned everything I've got.</v>

63
00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:42.350
<v Speaker 1>Instead of moving attention away from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the question of his criminality,</v>

64
00:03:42.351 --> 00:03:46.760
<v Speaker 1>Nixon aim the focus directly onto that </v>
<v Speaker 1>issue by denying it outright.</v>

65
00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:48.043
<v Speaker 1>A better magic trick is something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened a few years earlier when </v>

66
00:03:50.511 --> 00:03:53.450
<v Speaker 1>Vietnam war protests were gripping the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country in the 19 sixties,</v>

67
00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.010
<v Speaker 1>politicians and elites who supported the</v>
<v Speaker 1>war didn't address the protestors actual</v>

68
00:03:58.011 --> 00:04:00.320
<v Speaker 1>concerns about the legitimacy of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conflict.</v>

69
00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:01.573
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they reframed the antiwar protests as </v>

70
00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.933
<v Speaker 1>anti troop protests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this political sleight of hand has </v>

71
00:04:08.511 --> 00:04:11.570
<v Speaker 1>proven really fruitful and undercutting </v>
<v Speaker 1>protesters,</v>

72
00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.180
<v Speaker 1>not just the Vietnam War,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Gulf War,</v>

73
00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.500
<v Speaker 1>and the war on terror.</v>

74
00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:17.243
<v Speaker 3>Scare every American to find a way to </v>
<v Speaker 3>thank the men and women who are </v>

75
00:04:21.641 --> 00:04:22.630
<v Speaker 3>defending our freedom.</v>

76
00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm Donald Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Takes this a step further.</v>

77
00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.010
<v Speaker 1>He uses twitter to maneuver attention </v>
<v Speaker 1>away from negative press,</v>

78
00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:31.323
<v Speaker 1>but he doesn't reframe the debate so </v>
<v Speaker 1>much as distract the country with </v>

79
00:04:34.421 --> 00:04:37.510
<v Speaker 1>statements so glaringly false and </v>
<v Speaker 1>controversial,</v>

80
00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.700
<v Speaker 1>but the media is forced to expend its </v>
<v Speaker 1>energy on refuting them or covering them</v>

81
00:04:42.701 --> 00:04:43.534
<v Speaker 1>because they have to because the winning</v>
<v Speaker 1>president elect saying without evidence </v>

82
00:04:46.421 --> 00:04:47.254
<v Speaker 1>that millions of people voted illegally </v>
<v Speaker 1>will get ratings because when the </v>

83
00:04:50.711 --> 00:04:54.130
<v Speaker 1>president makes a force of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>presidency,</v>

84
00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.320
<v Speaker 1>that is in some sad way newsworthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then when you're done covering that,</v>

85
00:04:59.321 --> 00:05:00.154
<v Speaker 1>a new tweet comes in that says flag </v>
<v Speaker 1>burners should perhaps lose their </v>

86
00:05:02.441 --> 00:05:04.390
<v Speaker 1>citizenship or be sent to jail for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

87
00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really amazing.</v>

88
00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:11.350
<v Speaker 1>The attention goes where he wants it to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go and without the pressure of sustained</v>

89
00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:12.213
<v Speaker 1>focus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Chairman of the House oversight </v>

90
00:05:13.841 --> 00:05:16.000
<v Speaker 1>committee is free to brush the real </v>
<v Speaker 1>issue.</v>

91
00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:16.863
<v Speaker 1>The one we all forgot about aside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you can expect this kind of </v>

92
00:05:20.111 --> 00:05:23.560
<v Speaker 1>thing for the next four years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Expect every substantive criticism to be</v>

93
00:05:23.561 --> 00:05:24.394
<v Speaker 1>met with a ridiculous tweet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's time for all of us to start </v>

94
00:05:27.371 --> 00:05:28.204
<v Speaker 1>thinking of our own attention as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>limited and valuable resource because </v>

95
00:05:32.741 --> 00:05:33.574
<v Speaker 1>when you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can be a little more certain that </v>

96
00:05:35.861 --> 00:05:37.720
<v Speaker 1>the card,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your choosing.</v>

97
00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:42.160
<v Speaker 1>It's actually yours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stop.</v>
