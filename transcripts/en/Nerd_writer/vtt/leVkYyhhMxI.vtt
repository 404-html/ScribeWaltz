<v Speaker 1>Another day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another 10th blog,</v>

2
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.840
<v Speaker 1>coffee on a Tuesday and Vlog 50.</v>

3
00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.760
<v Speaker 1>In vlog 48,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked about reality,</v>

4
00:00:19.761 --> 00:00:23.120
<v Speaker 1>how growing up it seemed to me that much</v>
<v Speaker 1>of our social arrangements,</v>

5
00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.870
<v Speaker 1>our convention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>less rules than communal guidelines only</v>

6
00:00:26.871 --> 00:00:27.704
<v Speaker 1>as strong as the community makes them </v>
<v Speaker 1>and since the community is nothing but </v>

7
00:00:30.711 --> 00:00:31.544
<v Speaker 1>people its rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>its reality is as malleable as fluid as </v>

8
00:00:35.811 --> 00:00:36.644
<v Speaker 1>we are in Vlog 49 without saying so </v>
<v Speaker 1>challenge that premise somewhat by </v>

9
00:00:39.891 --> 00:00:42.950
<v Speaker 1>asking whether or not you should give </v>
<v Speaker 1>money to panhandlers.</v>

10
00:00:42.951 --> 00:00:43.784
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be silly to think that by </v>

11
00:00:44.751 --> 00:00:45.584
<v Speaker 1>asking such a question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to get at the incidental </v>

12
00:00:47.601 --> 00:00:50.690
<v Speaker 1>convention of my given community at my </v>
<v Speaker 1>given time,</v>

13
00:00:50.691 --> 00:00:53.660
<v Speaker 1>even if that type of answer is the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>forthcoming,</v>

14
00:00:53.661 --> 00:00:54.494
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to uncover a deeper rule,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a rule applicable to all circumstances </v>

15
00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:59.323
<v Speaker 1>and all times I was trying to suss out </v>
<v Speaker 1>the older and wiser sister of </v>

16
00:01:02.421 --> 00:01:05.000
<v Speaker 1>convention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's partner in the social universe.</v>

17
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.193
<v Speaker 1>The moral role.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today I'd like to complete this trilogy </v>

18
00:01:08.211 --> 00:01:13.010
<v Speaker 1>of videos and complete this line of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about morality as best I can.</v>

19
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.883
<v Speaker 1>Morality is about art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about what we ought to do when </v>

20
00:01:17.121 --> 00:01:17.954
<v Speaker 1>formulating a moral rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not saying what we should do in </v>

21
00:01:20.091 --> 00:01:24.020
<v Speaker 1>order for this or that to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to be confident that what we say</v>

22
00:01:24.021 --> 00:01:27.350
<v Speaker 1>is applicable to all people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a general rule.</v>

23
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:28.213
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say your friend tells you that </v>

24
00:01:29.181 --> 00:01:31.310
<v Speaker 1>they just got a new haircut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They love it,</v>

25
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.740
<v Speaker 1>but they want to know what you think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

26
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:34.603
<v Speaker 1>you may think it looks bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you say that it doesn't because you </v>

27
00:01:37.671 --> 00:01:40.310
<v Speaker 1>don't want to hurt their field.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the moral rule isn't.</v>

28
00:01:40.311 --> 00:01:43.760
<v Speaker 1>Don't tell jerry his bulk cut looks like</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit because he's got a thin skin.</v>

29
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.060
<v Speaker 1>Clearly that applies only to Jerry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The moral role might be worded.</v>

30
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.780
<v Speaker 1>Don't make people feel sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can help them,</v>

31
00:01:49.781 --> 00:01:52.250
<v Speaker 1>maybe you think it's right to tell Jerry</v>
<v Speaker 1>that his haircut,</v>

32
00:01:52.251 --> 00:01:54.800
<v Speaker 1>his unflattering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you value the truth.</v>

33
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.560
<v Speaker 1>Even if it hurts another legitimate </v>
<v Speaker 1>moral rule.</v>

34
00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.250
<v Speaker 1>Always be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see that morality is about right</v>

35
00:02:01.251 --> 00:02:03.770
<v Speaker 1>with a capital r and wrong with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>capital w,</v>

36
00:02:03.771 --> 00:02:08.030
<v Speaker 1>and of course people can disagree on </v>
<v Speaker 1>that like Jerry's two types of friends,</v>

37
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.893
<v Speaker 1>but that's a pretty innocuous example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's another from Jonathan hates the </v>

38
00:02:11.841 --> 00:02:12.674
<v Speaker 1>righteous mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Decide whether the people in this story </v>

39
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.943
<v Speaker 1>have done something morally wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so a family has a dog named spot that </v>

40
00:02:19.281 --> 00:02:21.290
<v Speaker 1>they love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've lived with them for many years.</v>

41
00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.970
<v Speaker 1>One day spot is tragically killed by a </v>
<v Speaker 1>car in front of the families.</v>

42
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.940
<v Speaker 1>The family having heard that dog meat is</v>
<v Speaker 1>delicious.</v>

43
00:02:28.941 --> 00:02:31.220
<v Speaker 1>Cut Up spots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>body cook it and eat him for dinner.</v>

44
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:32.810
<v Speaker 1>Nobody sees them do this.</v>

45
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.200
<v Speaker 1>So what do you think as hate explains </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're probably feeling is disgust.</v>

46
00:02:38.511 --> 00:02:41.300
<v Speaker 1>You want to say that this family has </v>
<v Speaker 1>done something wrong,</v>

47
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.770
<v Speaker 1>but then you remember it's their dog who</v>
<v Speaker 1>was already dead,</v>

48
00:02:45.771 --> 00:02:47.990
<v Speaker 1>so they didn't hurt it and nobody saw </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

49
00:02:47.991 --> 00:02:48.824
<v Speaker 1>so nobody was offended.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe in the end you decide that what </v>

50
00:02:51.081 --> 00:02:51.914
<v Speaker 1>the family did was disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something that you would never dream of </v>

51
00:02:54.711 --> 00:02:56.540
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but morally wrong.</v>

52
00:02:56.541 --> 00:02:57.374
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to say no if that's your </v>

53
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.460
<v Speaker 1>answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that's the way you feel,</v>

54
00:03:00.461 --> 00:03:01.294
<v Speaker 1>you're most likely from the west and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're most likely eliminate your </v>

55
00:03:04.511 --> 00:03:05.344
<v Speaker 1>morality boils down more or less to what</v>
<v Speaker 1>the utilitarian genius John Stuart Mill </v>

56
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:09.513
<v Speaker 1>wrote in his essay on liberty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what most western governments are based </v>

57
00:03:12.641 --> 00:03:13.474
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only purpose for which power can be </v>

58
00:03:14.591 --> 00:03:15.424
<v Speaker 1>rightly exercised over any member of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilized community against his will is </v>

59
00:03:19.391 --> 00:03:21.040
<v Speaker 1>to prevent harm to others.</v>

60
00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.903
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they're not people you'd want to </v>

61
00:03:22.691 --> 00:03:24.760
<v Speaker 1>be friends with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's their dog.</v>

62
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.620
<v Speaker 1>They're eating it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody was hurt,</v>

63
00:03:26.621 --> 00:03:28.300
<v Speaker 1>so leave them alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

64
00:03:28.301 --> 00:03:30.640
<v Speaker 1>if on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hear the story and you still say,</v>

65
00:03:30.641 --> 00:03:31.474
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is morally wrong than you are </v>

66
00:03:33.491 --> 00:03:36.970
<v Speaker 1>working off another axis of morality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to understand it,</v>

67
00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.570
<v Speaker 1>we have to look closer at what Haidt </v>
<v Speaker 1>calls moral foundations theory,</v>

68
00:03:40.571 --> 00:03:41.404
<v Speaker 1>the six axes of morality mixed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>matched in different peoples around the </v>

69
00:03:45.011 --> 00:03:45.700
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>

70
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:46.533
<v Speaker 1>we have care harm what we've essentially</v>
<v Speaker 1>already covered and what makes up most </v>

71
00:03:50.051 --> 00:03:50.884
<v Speaker 1>of the Western liberal morality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Making sure that nobody is hurt unless </v>

72
00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.400
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to hurt others and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone is properly cared for.</v>

73
00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:58.780
<v Speaker 1>Second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have fairness.</v>

74
00:03:58.781 --> 00:03:59.614
<v Speaker 1>Cheating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that will also be familiar to </v>

75
00:04:01.091 --> 00:04:01.924
<v Speaker 1>us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we believe that people should read a </v>

76
00:04:02.711 --> 00:04:07.420
<v Speaker 1>proportional share of what they saw and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we despise those who try to get more for</v>

77
00:04:07.421 --> 00:04:07.920
<v Speaker 1>less work.</v>

78
00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.100
<v Speaker 1>Third,</v>
<v Speaker 1>loyalty,</v>

79
00:04:09.101 --> 00:04:12.040
<v Speaker 1>betrayal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what makes us feel pride for our groups,</v>

80
00:04:12.041 --> 00:04:15.160
<v Speaker 1>whether they be sports teams or </v>
<v Speaker 1>political parties or nations,</v>

81
00:04:15.161 --> 00:04:15.994
<v Speaker 1>and what makes us feel rage against </v>
<v Speaker 1>those who are traders to fourth </v>

82
00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:20.520
<v Speaker 1>authority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Subversion,</v>

83
00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:21.363
<v Speaker 1>which highlights the feeling that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>need leaders and that we fall into some </v>

84
00:04:23.951 --> 00:04:27.490
<v Speaker 1>manmade or natural hierarchies like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>family or a corporation.</v>

85
00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:28.473
<v Speaker 1>Navigating this moral terrain means </v>
<v Speaker 1>respecting your superiors while gaining </v>

86
00:04:31.541 --> 00:04:32.374
<v Speaker 1>the respect from those below you so that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can move up and down the social </v>

87
00:04:34.931 --> 00:04:37.120
<v Speaker 1>ladder without triggering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number five,</v>

88
00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:38.410
<v Speaker 1>liberty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oppression.</v>

89
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.393
<v Speaker 1>We have a sense of when vulnerable </v>
<v Speaker 1>groups are being exploited or when our </v>

90
00:04:43.391 --> 00:04:46.510
<v Speaker 1>liberties are being infringed upon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say by a tyrant.</v>

91
00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:47.673
<v Speaker 1>This can be interpreted differently </v>
<v Speaker 1>based on what your political leanings </v>

92
00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.550
<v Speaker 1>and finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>number six,</v>

93
00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.610
<v Speaker 1>sanctity degradation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what may cause us to feel that yes,</v>

94
00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:55.593
<v Speaker 1>eating your own dog is morally wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are higher and lower ways of </v>

95
00:04:59.741 --> 00:04:59.980
<v Speaker 1>light.</v>

96
00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:00.813
<v Speaker 1>This foundation holds like a spectrum </v>
<v Speaker 1>stretching from lowly degenerates to </v>

97
00:05:03.791 --> 00:05:06.100
<v Speaker 1>pure soul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Western liberal morality,</v>

98
00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:06.993
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leans heavily on the care harm </v>

99
00:05:08.891 --> 00:05:10.930
<v Speaker 1>foundation with a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fairness.</v>

100
00:05:10.931 --> 00:05:13.060
<v Speaker 1>Cheating and liberty oppression thrown </v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

101
00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:16.390
<v Speaker 1>Liberals don't care so much about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other three.</v>

102
00:05:16.391 --> 00:05:19.250
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they may rail against them as immoral,</v>

103
00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.000
<v Speaker 1>but ours is not the only morality in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

104
00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:23.170
<v Speaker 1>Many cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

105
00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:24.400
<v Speaker 1>most cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

106
00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.300
<v Speaker 1>some in our own country put a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their stock in sanctity degradation,</v>

107
00:05:28.301 --> 00:05:30.460
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially religious culture.</v>

108
00:05:30.461 --> 00:05:34.120
<v Speaker 1>The Bible and other sacred texts are </v>
<v Speaker 1>filled with rules on how you're supposed</v>

109
00:05:34.121 --> 00:05:34.954
<v Speaker 1>to act to align yourself with God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For what reason should the Bible teach </v>

110
00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:42.730
<v Speaker 1>abstinence or the Torah forbid poor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If not that chastity is considered godly</v>

111
00:05:42.731 --> 00:05:45.520
<v Speaker 1>and pork is considered unclean and </v>
<v Speaker 1>impure.</v>

112
00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:46.383
<v Speaker 1>These are just a couple of the modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifestations of sanctity degradation </v>

113
00:05:49.031 --> 00:05:51.220
<v Speaker 1>and like authority,</v>
<v Speaker 1>subversion and loyalty,</v>

114
00:05:51.221 --> 00:05:51.820
<v Speaker 1>betrayal.</v>

115
00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:56.110
<v Speaker 1>They are felt more strongly in cultures </v>
<v Speaker 1>where the community is the central unit,</v>

116
00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:59.600
<v Speaker 1>not the individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why patriarchal societies exist,</v>

117
00:05:59.601 --> 00:06:02.570
<v Speaker 1>in which there are roles for women that </v>
<v Speaker 1>would make feminist gas,</v>

118
00:06:02.571 --> 00:06:03.404
<v Speaker 1>but in which those women don't speak out</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they see the family as more </v>

119
00:06:06.531 --> 00:06:07.364
<v Speaker 1>important than themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of these are real moralities and </v>

120
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.480
<v Speaker 1>each foundation is the product of </v>
<v Speaker 1>millions of years of evolution.</v>

121
00:06:14.481 --> 00:06:15.314
<v Speaker 1>They were naturally selected to overcome</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain adaptive challenges like caring </v>

122
00:06:19.251 --> 00:06:23.600
<v Speaker 1>for one's children or forming cohesive </v>
<v Speaker 1>coalitions or avoiding contaminants.</v>

123
00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:24.463
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the modern triggers for these </v>

124
00:06:25.011 --> 00:06:27.770
<v Speaker 1>foundations can be very different from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the original ones.</v>

125
00:06:27.771 --> 00:06:28.820
<v Speaker 1>100,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>

126
00:06:28.821 --> 00:06:31.730
<v Speaker 1>staying pure meant staying clean to </v>
<v Speaker 1>avoid infection,</v>

127
00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.820
<v Speaker 1>passing on animal meat that was rotten </v>
<v Speaker 1>or poisonous.</v>

128
00:06:34.821 --> 00:06:38.150
<v Speaker 1>Today it finds expression in virtue and </v>
<v Speaker 1>vice as they say,</v>

129
00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:42.410
<v Speaker 1>cleanliness is next to godliness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The essential point is that morality,</v>

130
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:47.500
<v Speaker 1>a product of evolution functions on more</v>
<v Speaker 1>axes than simply the golden rule.</v>

131
00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:48.793
<v Speaker 1>That's a descriptive fact about humans </v>
<v Speaker 1>and understanding all six foundations </v>

132
00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:56.480
<v Speaker 1>will help you not to immediately brush </v>
<v Speaker 1>off as stupid or evil.</v>

133
00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:57.433
<v Speaker 1>Those who think differently than you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not to say to be clear that all </v>

134
00:07:01.881 --> 00:07:05.390
<v Speaker 1>moralities and all moral foundations are</v>
<v Speaker 1>equally good,</v>

135
00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:10.840
<v Speaker 1>but deciding what combination is best </v>
<v Speaker 1>for society is the work of another field</v>

136
00:07:13.191 --> 00:07:15.740
<v Speaker 1>called normative ethics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's work.</v>

137
00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:18.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm afraid that I ought to leave up to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

138
00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:24.373
<v Speaker 1>Hey everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you so much for sticking with me </v>

139
00:07:26.841 --> 00:07:30.470
<v Speaker 1>for 50 blogs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe we've done that many.</v>

140
00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:34.640
<v Speaker 1>I think the nerd writer has transformed </v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot since the beginning.</v>

141
00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:35.743
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not a vlog about factoids or </v>

142
00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:42.270
<v Speaker 1>just learning stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a flag about building worldview.</v>

143
00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:43.153
<v Speaker 1>That's what the experiment of the nerd </v>
<v Speaker 1>writer is and I don't mean for you to </v>

144
00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:50.090
<v Speaker 1>take my worldview and that's what these </v>
<v Speaker 1>videos are.</v>

145
00:07:50.091 --> 00:07:53.720
<v Speaker 1>It's to see how you can build one for </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

146
00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:57.260
<v Speaker 1>If you want to watch parts one and two </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the morality trilogy,</v>

147
00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:58.490
<v Speaker 1>you can find them here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

148
00:07:58.491 --> 00:08:02.390
<v Speaker 1>don't forget to follow me on tumbler and</v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter links in the description.</v>

149
00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:05.060
<v Speaker 1>I hope you stay with me for another 50 </v>
<v Speaker 1>blogs.</v>

150
00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:07.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm excited to talk about more </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting,</v>

151
00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:09.530
<v Speaker 1>more complex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more subtle stuff.</v>

152
00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:10.873
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>
