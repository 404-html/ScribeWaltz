1
00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.690
<v Speaker 1>That's John was very tenacious people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They love molesting child's.</v>

2
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.000
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like their favorite thing.</v>

3
00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:10.963
<v Speaker 1>I mean when you can get so crazy because</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you consider the risk and being a </v>

4
00:00:13.831 --> 00:00:14.664
<v Speaker 1>child molester,</v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking not even the damage you're </v>

5
00:00:16.741 --> 00:00:17.910
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the risk,</v>

6
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.940
<v Speaker 1>there is no worse life available to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>human.</v>

7
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.590
<v Speaker 1>That being a child molester and yet they</v>
<v Speaker 1>still do it,</v>

8
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.980
<v Speaker 1>which from you could only really </v>
<v Speaker 1>surmised that it must be really good,</v>

9
00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.930
<v Speaker 1>but from their point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it must be amazing for that.</v>

10
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.750
<v Speaker 2>That joke offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people seem to think that it is.</v>

11
00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.630
<v Speaker 3>What if victims are watching what a </v>
<v Speaker 3>victim's parents are watching?</v>

12
00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:54.493
<v Speaker 3>It's such a sickening thing that happens</v>
<v Speaker 3>to people that I know comedians try to </v>

13
00:00:59.001 --> 00:01:02.990
<v Speaker 3>push the limit and they sometimes take </v>
<v Speaker 3>risks and they don't work,</v>

14
00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.600
<v Speaker 3>but I think with something like child </v>
<v Speaker 3>molestation,</v>

15
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:06.733
<v Speaker 3>it's just not funny and he's too clever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he could come up with a thousand </v>

16
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:11.203
<v Speaker 3>dollars.</v>

17
00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:12.093
<v Speaker 2>What are we really asking?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When we asked whether a joke or a tweet </v>

18
00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.013
<v Speaker 2>or an image is offensive or not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not asking really whether it's </v>

19
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.323
<v Speaker 2>someone was offended or we know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're asking if what was said was </v>

20
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.450
<v Speaker 2>morally right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how could somebody determined that?</v>

21
00:01:28.451 --> 00:01:30.610
<v Speaker 2>How do we know what a joke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

22
00:01:30.611 --> 00:01:35.530
<v Speaker 2>is morally and I feel there is no forum </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is acceptable for this ever.</v>

23
00:01:35.531 --> 00:01:36.050
<v Speaker 2>I know some</v>

24
00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.920
<v Speaker 1>that was molested at three years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three years old,</v>

25
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.540
<v Speaker 1>no nightclub.</v>

26
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.130
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no place ever deserves to have</v>

27
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.240
<v Speaker 1>that person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It</v>

28
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.083
<v Speaker 2>seems to think that it's the effect of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the joke that matters because child </v>

29
00:01:51.331 --> 00:01:52.164
<v Speaker 2>molestation is such a sensitive subject </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the harm caused is so gruesome </v>

30
00:01:56.221 --> 00:02:00.420
<v Speaker 2>and lasting because any light hearted </v>
<v Speaker 2>mention of it could in some way diminish</v>

31
00:02:00.421 --> 00:02:03.420
<v Speaker 2>the suffering of victims or bring that </v>
<v Speaker 2>pain back.</v>

32
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.600
<v Speaker 2>Child molestation as a topic should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>wholly avoided in the realm of comedy.</v>

33
00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.910
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's certainly a persuasive argument.</v>

34
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.773
<v Speaker 2>Comedies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>purpose can't be to cause pain to </v>

35
00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:18.840
<v Speaker 2>innocent victims,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but of course that wasn't the purpose of</v>

36
00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.820
<v Speaker 2>Louis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>CK is joke in the first place.</v>

37
00:02:20.821 --> 00:02:24.180
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't his intent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just comes down to one question.</v>

38
00:02:24.181 --> 00:02:25.860
<v Speaker 2>Intent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all about intent.</v>

39
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.960
<v Speaker 2>It's only about intent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In that clip,</v>

40
00:02:27.961 --> 00:02:32.670
<v Speaker 2>Ricky Gervais' argues the opposite of </v>
<v Speaker 2>effect being the moral judge of a joke,</v>

41
00:02:32.671 --> 00:02:33.504
<v Speaker 2>and instead says that it's the comedians</v>
<v Speaker 2>intention that really matters in the </v>

42
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:38.183
<v Speaker 2>end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clearly Louis Ck is intention in that </v>

43
00:02:39.841 --> 00:02:40.674
<v Speaker 2>joke is to use comedy to get us to think</v>
<v Speaker 2>about society's attitude and treatment </v>

44
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.180
<v Speaker 2>of pedophilia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>perhaps see intimate,</v>

45
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.023
<v Speaker 2>that we revile this demographic to </v>
<v Speaker 2>blindly taking solace in our normalcy </v>

46
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:53.693
<v Speaker 2>when we know that the complexities of </v>
<v Speaker 2>sexuality means that the urge to </v>

47
00:02:56.551 --> 00:03:01.551
<v Speaker 2>pedophilia is not something chosen never</v>
<v Speaker 2>does he forgive or validate the act.</v>

48
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.963
<v Speaker 2>He takes it for granted that child abuse</v>
<v Speaker 2>of any kind deserves the harshest scorn </v>

49
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.190
<v Speaker 2>and retribution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>

50
00:03:09.191 --> 00:03:12.700
<v Speaker 2>I think is the intent and for many the </v>
<v Speaker 2>effect of this joke,</v>

51
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:13.743
<v Speaker 2>a subtle indictment of our smug </v>
<v Speaker 2>righteousness and our fear of the law </v>

52
00:03:17.501 --> 00:03:20.200
<v Speaker 2>lessness of sexuality in civilized </v>
<v Speaker 2>society.</v>

53
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.850
<v Speaker 2>Indeed jokes are uniquely designed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>deliver messages like this.</v>

54
00:03:24.851 --> 00:03:25.684
<v Speaker 2>They sneak into consciousness past the </v>
<v Speaker 2>barriers that normally defend against </v>

55
00:03:29.751 --> 00:03:32.350
<v Speaker 2>the ways of thinking that threaten our </v>
<v Speaker 2>comfort.</v>

56
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:33.633
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not to say that I totally agree </v>

57
00:03:34.931 --> 00:03:37.810
<v Speaker 2>with Jervis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that intention is all that matters.</v>

58
00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.883
<v Speaker 2>Clearly it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to be aware of both the </v>

59
00:03:41.291 --> 00:03:45.670
<v Speaker 2>intention and the unintended </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequences of what we say.</v>

60
00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:46.713
<v Speaker 2>We all know that too often those in </v>
<v Speaker 2>privileged defined the boundaries of </v>

61
00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:54.850
<v Speaker 2>morality without taking into account the</v>
<v Speaker 2>decidedly different experiences of those</v>

62
00:03:54.851 --> 00:03:58.000
<v Speaker 2>who've been subjugated or marginalized </v>
<v Speaker 2>or worse.</v>

63
00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.863
<v Speaker 2>These debates about political </v>
<v Speaker 2>correctness and comedy had been </v>

64
00:04:01.061 --> 00:04:05.320
<v Speaker 2>happening more and more frequently as </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Internet has given voice to more and</v>

65
00:04:05.321 --> 00:04:06.154
<v Speaker 2>more people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm always amazed at how the arguments </v>

66
00:04:08.351 --> 00:04:11.650
<v Speaker 2>devolved so quickly into two opposing </v>
<v Speaker 2>camps.</v>

67
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:12.633
<v Speaker 2>One side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll raise a concern about a joke and </v>

68
00:04:14.351 --> 00:04:17.560
<v Speaker 2>the other will come down hard defending </v>
<v Speaker 2>jokes at all costs,</v>

69
00:04:17.561 --> 00:04:22.561
<v Speaker 2>lamenting the never ending encroachment </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Pc police and social justice warriors</v>

70
00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:23.613
<v Speaker 2>on free speech.</v>

71
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.020
<v Speaker 4>Just want to use these words.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's racist,</v>

72
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.270
<v Speaker 4>sexist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's prejudice.</v>

73
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.030
<v Speaker 2>What all this says to me is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>morality is messy.</v>

74
00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.690
<v Speaker 2>It shifts and changes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people often say that something went</v>

75
00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.050
<v Speaker 2>over the line,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there are no lines in morality.</v>

76
00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:45.250
<v Speaker 2>There's a no mans land,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a nebulous fringe of very,</v>

77
00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.740
<v Speaker 2>very tough questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way I see it,</v>

78
00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.600
<v Speaker 2>great comedians are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>detectives will take a look at luther or</v>

79
00:04:52.601 --> 00:04:56.950
<v Speaker 2>any other detective movie or TV show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's easy to see that as a society,</v>

80
00:04:56.951 --> 00:04:57.784
<v Speaker 2>we're sympathetic to the idea of letting</v>
<v Speaker 2>detectives bend the rules for the </v>

81
00:05:01.991 --> 00:05:02.824
<v Speaker 2>greater good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is because we understand that </v>

82
00:05:04.541 --> 00:05:07.630
<v Speaker 2>justice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like morality is abstract.</v>

83
00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:08.523
<v Speaker 2>Detectives are trained to navigate the </v>
<v Speaker 2>swamps at the edges of justice and we </v>

84
00:05:12.101 --> 00:05:12.934
<v Speaker 2>give them the leeway to do so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My opinion is that our best comedians </v>

85
00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.290
<v Speaker 2>should be given the same reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 2>leeway with morality.</v>

86
00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:24.100
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how the culture determines </v>
<v Speaker 2>who's allowed to do this.</v>

87
00:05:24.101 --> 00:05:28.360
<v Speaker 2>There are no easy answers for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think when a comedian is inducted into</v>

88
00:05:28.361 --> 00:05:29.194
<v Speaker 2>the professions highest ranks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just sort of know though I see how </v>

89
00:05:32.381 --> 00:05:35.530
<v Speaker 2>unsatisfying and answers that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Other than that,</v>

90
00:05:35.531 --> 00:05:38.110
<v Speaker 2>all we can do is look at the jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're intense,</v>

91
00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.570
<v Speaker 2>they're effect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and whether or not we're laughing,</v>

92
00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:46.080
<v Speaker 2>but if we want our collective morality </v>
<v Speaker 2>to remain nuanced and progressive,</v>

93
00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.823
<v Speaker 2>we have to let comedians near the things</v>
<v Speaker 2>we find uncomfortable or perhaps even </v>

94
00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:55.473
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>

95
00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:59.540
<v Speaker 2>Hey everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank you so much for watching.</v>

96
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.460
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to let you know that I am </v>
<v Speaker 2>producing the nerve writer full time,</v>

97
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:05.443

<v Speaker 2>into making the best possible stuff for </v>

98
00:06:10.371 --> 00:06:11.900
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stuff that I think is,</v>

99
00:06:11.901 --> 00:06:12.734
<v Speaker 2>I hope a cut above the torrent of </v>
<v Speaker 2>content that is being pushed out on the </v>

100
00:06:15.741 --> 00:06:16.574
<v Speaker 2>Internet everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you think that the nerd writer is </v>

101
00:06:18.111 --> 00:06:21.170
<v Speaker 2>something that you're not seeing </v>
<v Speaker 2>anywhere else on line on Youtube,</v>

102
00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:22.223
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to ask you to please support the </v>
