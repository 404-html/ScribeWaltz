1
00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:17.570
<v Speaker 1>The first piece of art that I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>intensely interested in,</v>

2
00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:22.130
<v Speaker 1>the first thing that affected me so </v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful that I was driven to understand</v>

3
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:23.423
<v Speaker 1>why sweeping epic about the Lord of </v>
<v Speaker 1>dreams that started me on a path that's </v>

4
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.510
<v Speaker 1>led to here dream or Morphea says he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>most commonly called in the series,</v>

5
00:00:33.511 --> 00:00:36.150
<v Speaker 1>has done the same for a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>

6
00:00:36.151 --> 00:00:36.984
<v Speaker 1>when game and made his lead character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the personification and master of </v>

7
00:00:39.961 --> 00:00:43.290
<v Speaker 1>dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he played on both meanings of the word,</v>

8
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.330
<v Speaker 1>the visions we have one asleep and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wishes that consume us when awake.</v>

9
00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.840
<v Speaker 1>There is so much to explore and Sandman </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I may do more on this,</v>

10
00:00:51.841 --> 00:00:52.674
<v Speaker 1>but today I want to zero in on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>unique place that William Shakespeare </v>

11
00:00:56.101 --> 00:00:56.934
<v Speaker 1>has in the series and how his presence </v>
<v Speaker 1>helps game and communicate some themes </v>

12
00:01:00.511 --> 00:01:01.344
<v Speaker 1>about writing dreams and genius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shakespeare makes three appearances in </v>

13
00:01:06.511 --> 00:01:07.344
<v Speaker 1>San man's 75 issues the first time we </v>
<v Speaker 1>see them as toward the beginning of the </v>

14
00:01:10.801 --> 00:01:11.634
<v Speaker 1>series in the context of another </v>
<v Speaker 1>person's story dream and his sister </v>

15
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.553
<v Speaker 1>death make an agreement in a 14th </v>
<v Speaker 1>century tavern when they overhear a man </v>

16
00:01:19.981 --> 00:01:20.520
<v Speaker 1>saying that.</v>

17
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.090
<v Speaker 1>The only reason people die is because </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone does it.</v>

18
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.403
<v Speaker 1>Death agrees not to take this man hub </v>
<v Speaker 1>gasoline until he desires it and dream </v>

19
00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:30.834
<v Speaker 1>agrees to meet him in the same bar once </v>
<v Speaker 1>every hundred years to discuss how he's </v>

20
00:01:35.071 --> 00:01:39.360
<v Speaker 1>feeling on their second meeting in 15,</v>
<v Speaker 1>89 dream and hop over here,</v>

21
00:01:39.361 --> 00:01:43.410
<v Speaker 1>a man name will shack spurred pining to </v>
<v Speaker 1>his friend and fellow playwright,</v>

22
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.513
<v Speaker 1>Kit Marlowe about his great wish to give</v>
<v Speaker 1>men dreams that would live on after I'm </v>

23
00:01:49.201 --> 00:01:51.360
<v Speaker 1>dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So dream strikes,</v>

24
00:01:51.361 --> 00:01:52.194
<v Speaker 1>another bargain with him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the details of which we learn on their </v>

25
00:01:55.231 --> 00:01:58.200
<v Speaker 1>second meeting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This time on the south downs of Sussex,</v>

26
00:01:58.201 --> 00:01:59.034
<v Speaker 1>England,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where Shakespeare traveling with a </v>

27
00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.173
<v Speaker 1>troupe of players is preparing his new </v>
<v Speaker 1>play of midsummer night's dream display </v>

28
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.263
<v Speaker 1>we learned was written for dream one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>two plays about dreams in exchange for </v>

29
00:02:10.561 --> 00:02:11.394
<v Speaker 1>Shakespeare becoming the figure we know </v>
<v Speaker 1>today the vessel for the great stories </v>

30
00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.283
<v Speaker 1>of mankind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shakespeare's troop are enticed to </v>

31
00:02:18.121 --> 00:02:22.830
<v Speaker 1>perform for the real inhabitants of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fairy were visiting the earthly realm at</v>

32
00:02:22.831 --> 00:02:23.940
<v Speaker 1>dreams invitation.</v>

33
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:24.803
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps for the last time in the process</v>
<v Speaker 1>of this story which takes place toward </v>

34
00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.120
<v Speaker 1>the middle of the series.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dream begins to question if he was right</v>

35
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.680
<v Speaker 1>for giving shakespeare what he wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did not understand the cost.</v>

36
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.390
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mortals never do.</v>

37
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.450
<v Speaker 1>They only see the prize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their heart's desire,</v>

38
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:43.553
<v Speaker 1>their dream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the price of getting what you want </v>

39
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.273
<v Speaker 1>is getting what you once wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here we begin to see the purpose behind </v>

40
00:02:51.241 --> 00:02:56.241
<v Speaker 1>Shakespeare's inclusion in this series </v>
<v Speaker 1>through Shakespeare and analog for dream</v>

41
00:02:56.791 --> 00:03:01.720
<v Speaker 1>and Gaiman himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We get a meditation not only on genius,</v>

42
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.140
<v Speaker 1>but on the cost of genius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The for gaming.</v>

43
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.770
<v Speaker 1>That cost is isolation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isolation of all forms.</v>

44
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.860
<v Speaker 1>In this issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we meet him,</v>

45
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.823
<v Speaker 1>Shakespeare son,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shakespeare seems to regard him as a </v>

46
00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:17.410
<v Speaker 1>nuisance and Hamnett laments to another </v>
<v Speaker 1>actor.</v>

47
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:18.753
<v Speaker 1>He's very distant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't seem like he's really there </v>

48
00:03:21.131 --> 00:03:22.240
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not really.</v>

49
00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:23.770
<v Speaker 1>It's like he's somewhere else.</v>

50
00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:26.620
<v Speaker 1>Anything that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just make stories out of it.</v>

51
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm less real than any of the characters</v>
<v Speaker 1>in his place.</v>

52
00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:31.443
<v Speaker 1>In his eagerness to write great stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shakespeare becomes isolated from his </v>

53
00:03:35.141 --> 00:03:39.850
<v Speaker 1>family and his life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>such as the cost of extreme focus,</v>

54
00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.280
<v Speaker 1>but works of genius also become isolated</v>
<v Speaker 1>from their context.</v>

55
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:46.533
<v Speaker 1>At the intermission of the play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dream breaks the news to Shakespeare </v>

56
00:03:49.001 --> 00:03:52.360
<v Speaker 1>that his friend Christopher Marlowe has </v>
<v Speaker 1>been killed.</v>

57
00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:53.563
<v Speaker 1>The timing is no accident here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rise of Shakespeare beginning with </v>

58
00:03:56.711 --> 00:03:57.544
<v Speaker 1>plays like a midsummer night's dream </v>
<v Speaker 1>signaled the disappearance of his </v>

59
00:04:01.001 --> 00:04:01.834
<v Speaker 1>contemporaries like Christopher Marlowe </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the historical record in modern </v>

60
00:04:05.711 --> 00:04:07.930
<v Speaker 1>cultural memory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Barring academia,</v>

61
00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.883
<v Speaker 1>their presence has been overshadowed by </v>
<v Speaker 1>isolated genius game and picks up this </v>

62
00:04:13.571 --> 00:04:16.780
<v Speaker 1>theme again in the final appearance of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Shakespeare in Sandman,</v>

63
00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.070
<v Speaker 1>which is also not accidentally the final</v>
<v Speaker 1>issue of the series.</v>

64
00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:24.070
<v Speaker 1>Here Shakespeare is writing his final </v>
<v Speaker 1>play,</v>

65
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.980
<v Speaker 1>the tempest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the second play at the end of his career</v>

66
00:04:26.981 --> 00:04:29.110
<v Speaker 1>that fulfills his bargain with dream.</v>

67
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:30.513
<v Speaker 1>His friend and sometimes critic Ben </v>
<v Speaker 1>Johnson comes to visit him and asks </v>

68
00:04:33.671 --> 00:04:34.504
<v Speaker 1>about the new play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you been rating poor Holland shed </v>

69
00:04:36.971 --> 00:04:37.804
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or does plutarch's bear the brunt of </v>

70
00:04:39.251 --> 00:04:40.084
<v Speaker 1>your depredations?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This of course references the fact that </v>

71
00:04:42.461 --> 00:04:43.294
<v Speaker 1>Shakespeare famously took many of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>plots from prior sources and histories </v>

72
00:04:46.991 --> 00:04:49.850
<v Speaker 1>like those of Rafael Holland shed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>plutarch.</v>

73
00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:51.183
<v Speaker 1>Yet these sources like small planets </v>
<v Speaker 1>like Christopher Marlowe and Ben </v>

74
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.833
<v Speaker 1>Johnson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do not register against the massive </v>

75
00:04:57.611 --> 00:04:59.440
<v Speaker 1>star.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is Shakespeare.</v>

76
00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:04.150
<v Speaker 1>An example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back in the first issue in 1789 at their</v>

77
00:05:04.151 --> 00:05:04.984
<v Speaker 1>fourth meeting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hob gambling tells dream he has seen a </v>

78
00:05:07.961 --> 00:05:12.961
<v Speaker 1>production of King Lear mentioning the </v>
<v Speaker 1>idiots have given it a happy ending that</v>

79
00:05:13.961 --> 00:05:14.794
<v Speaker 1>will not last dream says the great </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories will always return to their </v>

80
00:05:18.101 --> 00:05:21.700
<v Speaker 1>original forms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here Gaiman is playing with us.</v>

81
00:05:21.701 --> 00:05:25.390
<v Speaker 1>He knows what the average man epitomized</v>
<v Speaker 1>by hop gatling does,</v>

82
00:05:25.391 --> 00:05:28.720
<v Speaker 1>not that it was shakespeare who changed </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ending.</v>

83
00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.580
<v Speaker 1>The original versions on which lear was </v>
<v Speaker 1>base did have a happy ending,</v>

84
00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:34.443
<v Speaker 1>but those versions are for God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet by having dreams say the great </v>

85
00:05:38.471 --> 00:05:41.470
<v Speaker 1>stories will always return to their </v>
<v Speaker 1>original forms.</v>

86
00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:45.670
<v Speaker 1>Gaming indicates perhaps the key theme </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the whole series,</v>

87
00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:50.970
<v Speaker 1>the power of dreams to supplant reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the second issue,</v>

88
00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:51.993
<v Speaker 1>Oberon King of fairy watches </v>
<v Speaker 1>Shakespeare's play about himself and </v>

89
00:05:55.691 --> 00:05:58.460
<v Speaker 1>says to dream what but things never </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>

90
00:05:58.461 --> 00:06:01.730
<v Speaker 1>Thus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dream responds apropos of this theme,</v>

91
00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:05.360
<v Speaker 1>things need not have happened to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>

92
00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:06.703
<v Speaker 1>Tales and dreams are the shadow truths </v>
<v Speaker 1>that will endure when mere facts are </v>

93
00:06:11.451 --> 00:06:12.284
<v Speaker 1>dust and ashes and forgot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The very next panel features the line </v>

94
00:06:16.311 --> 00:06:20.300
<v Speaker 1>from a midsummer night's dream that </v>
<v Speaker 1>criticizes the power of stories,</v>

95
00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:25.780
<v Speaker 1>the best in this kind or but shadows </v>
<v Speaker 1>gaming like Shakespeare disagrees,</v>

96
00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:29.780
<v Speaker 1>the shadows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these illusions of reality incomplete as</v>

97
00:06:29.781 --> 00:06:33.560
<v Speaker 1>they are may come in time to replace the</v>
<v Speaker 1>real thing.</v>

98
00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:38.030
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shakespeare was the vessel for extremely</v>

99
00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:41.360
<v Speaker 1>powerful stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His treatments of culture,</v>

100
00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:46.390
<v Speaker 1>of love and madness in many ways created</v>
<v Speaker 1>the age we still live in.</v>

101
00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:52.390
<v Speaker 1>We are all in a very real sense living </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the dreams of Shakespeare.</v>

102
00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:54.643
<v Speaker 1>Sandman is a singular work of art coming</v>
<v Speaker 1>and propelling comics into a higher </v>

103
00:06:58.940 --> 00:06:59.773
<v Speaker 1>literary appreciation and pulling like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Shakespeare's work on a vast catalog of </v>

104
00:07:04.131 --> 00:07:07.040
<v Speaker 1>mythological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>religious and literary references.</v>

105
00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:11.210
<v Speaker 1>It's fitting that gaming is more </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in Shakespeare,</v>

106
00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:15.470
<v Speaker 1>the man that his work Shakespeare dream </v>
<v Speaker 1>and game and like I said,</v>

107
00:07:15.471 --> 00:07:16.304
<v Speaker 1>are all analogs for one another and each</v>
<v Speaker 1>in their turn have to examine the costs </v>

108
00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:24.980
<v Speaker 1>of telling great stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The largest part of that cost,</v>

109
00:07:24.981 --> 00:07:25.814
<v Speaker 1>it seems is isolation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched my life as if it were </v>

110
00:07:29.661 --> 00:07:30.494
<v Speaker 1>happening to someone else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shakespeare tell street my son died and </v>

111
00:07:33.801 --> 00:07:34.634
<v Speaker 1>I was hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I watched my hurt and even relished </v>

112
00:07:38.421 --> 00:07:41.510
<v Speaker 1>it a little for now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could write a real death,</v>

113
00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:45.890
<v Speaker 1>a true loss in three issues that span </v>
<v Speaker 1>the series.</v>

114
00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:46.723
<v Speaker 1>Neil gaiman treats these themes of </v>
<v Speaker 1>genius and isolation within a larger </v>

115
00:07:50.421 --> 00:07:54.320
<v Speaker 1>framework of a story that is essentially</v>
<v Speaker 1>about stories.</v>

116
00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:59.730
<v Speaker 1>The inclusion of Shakespeare highlights </v>
<v Speaker 1>the uneasy relationship between stories,</v>

117
00:07:59.751 --> 00:08:02.210
<v Speaker 1>collective dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those who create them.</v>

118
00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:03.613
<v Speaker 1>History and imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>amend Shakespeare to fit their purposes </v>

119
00:08:06.831 --> 00:08:07.664
<v Speaker 1>just as Gaiman does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by bringing him to life in the pages of </v>

120
00:08:10.281 --> 00:08:11.114
<v Speaker 1>Sandman and game and imagines him </v>
<v Speaker 1>isolated from his own life as history </v>

121
00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:20.440
<v Speaker 1>has isolated him above his time and </v>
<v Speaker 1>place even as we make our work,</v>

122
00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:26.540
<v Speaker 1>our work makes us and it can obliterate </v>
<v Speaker 1>us to.</v>

123
00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:30.620
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dreams really do</v>

124
00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:33.170
<v Speaker 2>come true.</v>

125
00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:41.183
<v Speaker 3>Hey everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thanks for watching and welcome to </v>

126
00:08:42.691 --> 00:08:46.140
<v Speaker 3>everybody who is new to the nerd writer </v>
<v Speaker 3>that inside out video.</v>

127
00:08:46.141 --> 00:08:49.260
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe so many people watched </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

128
00:08:49.261 --> 00:08:51.990
<v Speaker 3>That was just an awesome experience last</v>
<v Speaker 3>week,</v>

129
00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:55.760
<v Speaker 3>but this is a great example of the kind </v>
<v Speaker 3>of stuff we do here.</v>

130
00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:56.613
<v Speaker 3>The nerd writer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we take art and culture and science and </v>

131
00:08:58.801 --> 00:08:59.634
<v Speaker 3>politics and explore them and go in </v>
<v Speaker 3>depth and put ideas to work and that's </v>

132
00:09:03.721 --> 00:09:07.740
<v Speaker 3>what this is all about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the channel is made possible by your</v>

133
00:09:07.741 --> 00:09:12.180
<v Speaker 3>pledges on my Patrion page right here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this little as a dollar per video,</v>

134
00:09:12.181 --> 00:09:13.014
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the money that you guys give me goes </v>

135
00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:16.930
<v Speaker 3>directly into these videos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

136
00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:18.810
<v Speaker 3>and to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>toward improving the channel.</v>

137
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:22.200
<v Speaker 3>And that is really what I want to do is </v>
<v Speaker 3>push this medium farther,</v>

138
00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:23.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>create new styles,</v>

139
00:09:23.911 --> 00:09:26.040
<v Speaker 3>new ways of exploring and explaining </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas.</v>

140
00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:28.320
<v Speaker 3>And there's a lot more than I want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

141
00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:29.213
<v Speaker 3>This was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been thinking about how to analyze </v>

142
00:09:30.661 --> 00:09:32.790
<v Speaker 3>comics for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hope you enjoyed it.</v>
