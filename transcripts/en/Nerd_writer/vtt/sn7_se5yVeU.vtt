00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:10.210
<v Speaker 1>Hey</v>

2
00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:11.043
<v Speaker 2>everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so a lot of people out there have been </v>

3
00:00:11.981 --> 00:00:12.814
<v Speaker 2>asking me about my writing and whether </v>
<v Speaker 2>or not there's something of mine that </v>

4
00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:17.200
<v Speaker 2>you can read.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

5
00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.720
<v Speaker 2>today I'm going to be releasing my first</v>
<v Speaker 2>book,</v>

6
00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:20.613
<v Speaker 2>Big City,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I wrote about a year ago on </v>

7
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.710
<v Speaker 2>gumroad.com,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a digital copy for $3.</v>

8
00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.660

<v Speaker 2>fair.</v>

9
00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.470
<v Speaker 2>I put a lot of work into this and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't think it's so much money where you</v>

10
00:00:32.471 --> 00:00:35.290
<v Speaker 2>know if you don't like the book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you feel that you've wasted it.</v>

11
00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.420
<v Speaker 2>Obviously though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope that you do like it.</v>

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.960
<v Speaker 2>You can find the link for the full text </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the dupe later today.</v>

13
00:00:43.781 --> 00:00:44.614
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be reading the first part </v>
<v Speaker 2>of it for you firstly because I love to </v>

14
00:00:47.981 --> 00:00:49.900
<v Speaker 2>read and listen to fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Secondly,</v>

15
00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.580
<v Speaker 2>because it'll give you guys a chance to </v>
<v Speaker 2>see what the book will be like.</v>

16
00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:55.563
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a few words here before I get </v>

17
00:00:57.191 --> 00:00:58.510
<v Speaker 2>started.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the way of a summary,</v>

18
00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.930
<v Speaker 2>imagine that you're reading the back </v>
<v Speaker 2>flap here in the bookstore.</v>

19
00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:03.843
<v Speaker 2>As the title suggests,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the story is about a big city and </v>

20
00:01:07.091 --> 00:01:07.924
<v Speaker 2>impossibly big city of vast urban sprawl</v>
<v Speaker 2>that goes on and on in every direction </v>

21
00:01:12.631 --> 00:01:13.464
<v Speaker 2>of city you couldn't possibly see all of</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a lifetime and one in which people </v>

22
00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.003
<v Speaker 2>get so easily lost in the confusion of </v>
<v Speaker 2>streets and high rises and bars and </v>

23
00:01:23.531 --> 00:01:25.600
<v Speaker 2>moving lights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a science fiction setting,</v>

24
00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:26.643
<v Speaker 2>certainly influenced by cyber punk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the story is about eight people who </v>

25
00:01:30.851 --> 00:01:31.684
<v Speaker 2>are trying to live and survive in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>chaotic mess of a place and who are all </v>

26
00:01:36.821 --> 00:01:37.654
<v Speaker 2>experiencing this very unique and </v>
<v Speaker 2>strange phenomenon called seeing the </v>

27
00:01:43.691 --> 00:01:44.524
<v Speaker 2>whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now there is a secret buried in the </v>

28
00:01:47.721 --> 00:01:48.554
<v Speaker 2>story about what the city is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what seeing the whole thing means about </v>

29
00:01:51.671 --> 00:01:53.710
<v Speaker 2>what they're all doing there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but of course you have to read the whole</v>

30
00:01:53.711 --> 00:01:55.480
<v Speaker 2>thing to find out what that what that </v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

31
00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.540
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so go to a dark place,</v>

32
00:01:58.541 --> 00:01:59.800
<v Speaker 2>getting them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting the mood.</v>

33
00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.270
<v Speaker 2>Here's the first part of big city called</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mac ludgate.</v>

34
00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.920
<v Speaker 2>Mac ludgate returned from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] region,</v>

35
00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:09.783
<v Speaker 2>also called coat Malai,</v>
<v Speaker 2>province and sector 22 way without a </v>

36
00:02:12.941 --> 00:02:13.774
<v Speaker 2>tatter of currency to his name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had begun his sojourn to that </v>

37
00:02:16.421 --> 00:02:18.430
<v Speaker 2>blistery junction of try district </v>
<v Speaker 2>gambling,</v>

38
00:02:18.431 --> 00:02:21.160
<v Speaker 2>not six months before dreaming of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>streak,</v>

39
00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.030
<v Speaker 2>but all he got was a dark new </v>
<v Speaker 2>appreciation for settling debts.</v>

40
00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.200
<v Speaker 2>He picked the scab on his forehead and </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought this is ready to fall off as the</v>

41
00:02:29.201 --> 00:02:30.034
<v Speaker 2>automated female voice recording spat </v>
<v Speaker 2>out the name of his home district now </v>

42
00:02:33.251 --> 00:02:37.120
<v Speaker 2>entering loan and district Taj Zhou </v>
<v Speaker 2>Province municipal sector 25.</v>

43
00:02:37.121 --> 00:02:37.954
<v Speaker 2>A change here for all silverline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tram stores will open on my right and </v>

44
00:02:41.501 --> 00:02:45.070
<v Speaker 2>again in three alternate languages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was wrong about the scab.</v>

45
00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:46.203
<v Speaker 2>It bled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here were the things Mac knew as he </v>

46
00:02:48.821 --> 00:02:53.050
<v Speaker 2>stepped from the tram into loan n one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he could stay at Shelly's for as long as</v>

47
00:02:53.051 --> 00:02:56.230
<v Speaker 2>he liked to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The ice on most of his bets was covered.</v>

48
00:02:56.231 --> 00:02:59.290
<v Speaker 2>He had little to worry about in the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>of rancorous businessmen.</v>

49
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.930
<v Speaker 2>Three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was guaranteed at least one free meal</v>

50
00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.963
<v Speaker 2>everyday at his uncle Warren's </v>
<v Speaker 2>restaurant on the corner of 15th and </v>

51
00:03:05.591 --> 00:03:07.510
<v Speaker 2>Catskill Street,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and four,</v>

52
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:08.373
<v Speaker 2>there was every chance that Mr Hoy econ </v>
<v Speaker 2>would hire him back to his old position </v>

53
00:03:11.531 --> 00:03:15.370
<v Speaker 2>at lm and p.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So long as Hoy con didn't know that mack</v>

54
00:03:15.371 --> 00:03:16.204
<v Speaker 2>was living with his daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he nestled himself into the cocoon of </v>

55
00:03:18.521 --> 00:03:22.240
<v Speaker 2>these near certainties and use them as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>coat against the unseasonable.</v>

56
00:03:22.241 --> 00:03:23.074
<v Speaker 2>Cold</v>

57
00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:25.223
<v Speaker 2>loan and station was empty and they'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>mac could not recall the time when it </v>

58
00:03:28.591 --> 00:03:30.720
<v Speaker 2>was otherwise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The space provoked in him,</v>

59
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.260
<v Speaker 2>the feeling of being only recently </v>
<v Speaker 2>abandoned by a host of people,</v>

60
00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.370
<v Speaker 2>strange that anyone would gather here he</v>
<v Speaker 2>said to himself as a rush of hot air,</v>

61
00:03:38.371 --> 00:03:39.204
<v Speaker 2>move through the terminal and at once </v>
<v Speaker 2>vivified his suspicions with paralyzing </v>

62
00:03:42.481 --> 00:03:45.180
<v Speaker 2>emphasis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hints of Phantom Card players,</v>

63
00:03:45.181 --> 00:03:47.970
<v Speaker 2>eyes receding into their sockets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rhinestone whores,</v>

64
00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.890
<v Speaker 2>toothless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>always smiling,</v>

65
00:03:49.891 --> 00:03:52.500
<v Speaker 2>the flotsam of degeneracy behind every </v>
<v Speaker 2>corner.</v>

66
00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:53.543
<v Speaker 2>He was sure of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mac blinked rapidly to dispel these </v>

67
00:03:55.951 --> 00:03:59.040
<v Speaker 2>apparitions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but captured instead the after images of</v>

68
00:03:59.041 --> 00:04:03.240
<v Speaker 2>dusty fluorescents that spread light </v>
<v Speaker 2>through the station all thin and dry,</v>

69
00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.310
<v Speaker 2>more ghosts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had followed him here.</v>

70
00:04:05.311 --> 00:04:07.350
<v Speaker 2>Nerves short circuited.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>

71
00:04:07.351 --> 00:04:08.184
<v Speaker 2>Six months of uppers withdraw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His heart raced away and these silly </v>

72
00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:12.084
<v Speaker 2>tricks of the night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so affected Max eggshell spirit that he </v>

73
00:04:14.971 --> 00:04:15.804
<v Speaker 2>ran from loan and station and a boyish </v>
<v Speaker 2>frenzy fleeing a host of illusory </v>

74
00:04:19.801 --> 00:04:20.634
<v Speaker 2>terrorists.</v>

75
00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:23.653
<v Speaker 2>Shelly grave lived on the east side of </v>
<v Speaker 2>loan end in a triplex behind Jefferson </v>

76
00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:29.353
<v Speaker 2>Park,</v>
<v Speaker 2>near Uncle Warren's restaurant on 15th </v>

77
00:04:30.501 --> 00:04:34.640
<v Speaker 2>have a building that small was a rare </v>
<v Speaker 2>commodity and loan n and rare is still.</v>

78
00:04:34.641 --> 00:04:37.430
<v Speaker 2>She and her daughter Lisa occupied the </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole first floor.</v>

79
00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.353
<v Speaker 2>Most of that district's population was </v>
<v Speaker 2>crammed into the row of towering </v>

80
00:04:41.031 --> 00:04:43.790
<v Speaker 2>apartment blocks that lined the far edge</v>
<v Speaker 2>of town,</v>

81
00:04:43.791 --> 00:04:44.624
<v Speaker 2>but shelly had gotten years ago at a low</v>
<v Speaker 2>fixed rent before prices rose </v>

82
00:04:47.631 --> 00:04:48.464
<v Speaker 2>drastically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>District wide fluctuations of that kind </v>

83
00:04:50.721 --> 00:04:51.554
<v Speaker 2>were frequent and all sectors of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>city like when through skyscraper and </v>

84
00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.290
<v Speaker 2>streets and unexplainable as a matter of</v>
<v Speaker 2>course.</v>

85
00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:58.723
<v Speaker 2>Why this particular rent stayed fixed is</v>
<v Speaker 2>easy enough to puzzle out if you know </v>

86
00:05:02.631 --> 00:05:05.230
<v Speaker 2>Shelly Mac</v>

87
00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:06.063
<v Speaker 2>knocked on her door,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hasn't hesitantly in a way a man does </v>

88
00:05:08.591 --> 00:05:09.424
<v Speaker 2>when he is merely trying to prove to </v>
<v Speaker 2>himself that he was there and did that </v>

89
00:05:12.551 --> 00:05:13.450
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

90
00:05:13.451 --> 00:05:16.780
<v Speaker 2>He was of two minds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he needed rest and warm sometime for his</v>

91
00:05:16.781 --> 00:05:17.614
<v Speaker 2>nerves to settle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was clear from the episode at the </v>

92
00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.330
<v Speaker 2>Tram Station,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but being here bashfully,</v>

93
00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.193
<v Speaker 2>knocking like a teenager,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Matt could not help but recognize a </v>

94
00:05:25.481 --> 00:05:30.040
<v Speaker 2>scene from a story played over and over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It annoyed him to know what shelly would</v>

95
00:05:30.041 --> 00:05:32.680
<v Speaker 2>say when she opened the door,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how he would respond,</v>

96
00:05:32.681 --> 00:05:33.514
<v Speaker 2>where the night would go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the next day would bring and so </v>

97
00:05:35.561 --> 00:05:36.394
<v Speaker 2>forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wanted desperately to deviate from </v>

98
00:05:37.661 --> 00:05:39.700
<v Speaker 2>this plot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was hopeless.</v>

99
00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:40.593
<v Speaker 2>His character always wanted to deviate </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the scene to do something impetuous </v>

100
00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:47.440
<v Speaker 2>or dangerous or just plain wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but never did.</v>

101
00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:50.410
<v Speaker 2>So shelly opened the door and the story </v>
<v Speaker 2>played on,</v>

102
00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:52.480
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a millionaire.</v>

103
00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's all yours.</v>

104
00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.290
<v Speaker 2>He pushed fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's that smell?</v>

105
00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:58.790
<v Speaker 2>Does that fish?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where did you get fish from?</v>

106
00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:00.403
<v Speaker 2>So you expect to come in and what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She had already botched the practice </v>

107
00:06:03.201 --> 00:06:05.750
<v Speaker 2>speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jump in bed with this is in your world.</v>

108
00:06:05.751 --> 00:06:07.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm walking around and Mac,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen to me.</v>

109
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.940
<v Speaker 2>I give my arm for a dose of Xeno.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got Any,</v>

110
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.580
<v Speaker 2>but he had already spotted traces on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>coffee table,</v>

111
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:14.593
<v Speaker 2>tiny blue speck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sprinkled over the smiles of magazine </v>

112
00:06:16.761 --> 00:06:17.594
<v Speaker 2>cover girls and grocery store coupons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He turned over an issue of celebrity </v>

113
00:06:21.291 --> 00:06:24.050
<v Speaker 2>health with the famous actress Jocelyn </v>
<v Speaker 2>Marquette,</v>

114
00:06:24.051 --> 00:06:26.780
<v Speaker 2>posing candidly on the cover and there </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>

115
00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:29.510
<v Speaker 2>The feebly hid porcelain jar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No data piece.</v>

116
00:06:29.511 --> 00:06:31.850
<v Speaker 2>Spade my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>her daughter Lisa in school.</v>

117
00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:34.250
<v Speaker 2>Bingo Mac.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Join me,</v>

118
00:06:34.251 --> 00:06:35.840
<v Speaker 2>will you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can yell at each other tomorrow.</v>

119
00:06:35.841 --> 00:06:36.674
<v Speaker 2>I'm deadbeat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He dropped a small blue tablet into his </v>

120
00:06:39.231 --> 00:06:40.064
<v Speaker 2>pipe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One thing he had not lost in Cotana and </v>

121
00:06:42.081 --> 00:06:43.820
<v Speaker 2>ground it down with the bud of the pen.</v>

122
00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:47.990
<v Speaker 2>One long drag and stupidity crashed over</v>
<v Speaker 2>his mind.</v>

123
00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:49.220
<v Speaker 2>Simplicity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

124
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:50.353
<v Speaker 2>The end of all thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He passed the pipe to shelly who seemed </v>

125
00:06:52.791 --> 00:06:55.190
<v Speaker 2>to have given up her protests at site of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the drug.</v>

126
00:06:55.191 --> 00:06:56.350
<v Speaker 2>She was thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

127
00:06:56.351 --> 00:06:58.880
<v Speaker 2>finish this tomorrow and took a drag for</v>
<v Speaker 2>herself,</v>

128
00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:00.043
<v Speaker 2>a sweet repos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She nestled herself into the crook of </v>

129
00:07:02.601 --> 00:07:06.380
<v Speaker 2>his arm and together they sank into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>red round cushions of the couch.</v>

130
00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:10.850
<v Speaker 2>Nothing moved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The television was tuned to one of those</v>

131
00:07:10.851 --> 00:07:11.684
<v Speaker 2>channels which only plays music probably</v>
<v Speaker 2>because shelly couldn't afford a full </v>

132
00:07:15.321 --> 00:07:17.360
<v Speaker 2>entertainment package.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The noise was faint,</v>

133
00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:18.463
<v Speaker 2>but Mac caught enough to discern which </v>
<v Speaker 2>channel it was he needed to have heard </v>

134
00:07:20.931 --> 00:07:21.764
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Though shelly only ever played one </v>

135
00:07:22.941 --> 00:07:23.774
<v Speaker 2>station this late at night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly when she was dosing city </v>

136
00:07:26.451 --> 00:07:28.130
<v Speaker 2>reflections.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Istation,</v>

137
00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:28.993
<v Speaker 2>unlike any other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sole purpose was to catch old </v>

138
00:07:31.941 --> 00:07:36.290
<v Speaker 2>frequencies that had been broadcast and </v>
<v Speaker 2>set bouncing into the city sound maze of</v>

139
00:07:36.291 --> 00:07:37.370
<v Speaker 2>a trillion buildings.</v>

140
00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:38.383
<v Speaker 2>You might hear something on reflections </v>
<v Speaker 2>that had been played a thousand years </v>

141
00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:43.010
<v Speaker 2>ago in a province you would never know </v>
<v Speaker 2>the name of,</v>

142
00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:45.440
<v Speaker 2>but who could say after all that </v>
<v Speaker 2>bounding and rebounding,</v>

143
00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:49.250
<v Speaker 2>if what you were hearing was the music </v>
<v Speaker 2>as it was originally recorded,</v>

144
00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:52.790
<v Speaker 2>who could say if it was even music,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might just a well has been,</v>

145
00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:56.480
<v Speaker 2>have been modulated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Police sirens or distressing those maybe</v>

146
00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:59.600
<v Speaker 2>the arrhythmic calculations of an </v>
<v Speaker 2>ancient supercomputer.</v>

147
00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.440
<v Speaker 2>It gave people a sense of communion </v>
<v Speaker 2>anyway.</v>

148
00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:04.333
<v Speaker 2>It helps them forget the size of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>city or else feel the magnitude and its </v>

149
00:08:07.971 --> 00:08:11.060
<v Speaker 2>full capacity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mack was proud that his district set the</v>

150
00:08:11.061 --> 00:08:15.230
<v Speaker 2>places he had heard of had invented </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like city reflections.</v>

151
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:18.590
<v Speaker 2>He wondered if other places had it to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the music,</v>

152
00:08:18.591 --> 00:08:21.890
<v Speaker 2>pulsed over the room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cautiously like a vessel signaling.</v>

153
00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:22.843
<v Speaker 2>It's approach a port in a low fog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they allowed that strange melody to </v>

154
00:08:26.181 --> 00:08:27.014
<v Speaker 2>fuse it's essence with their own,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both of them being so dissatisfied at </v>

155
00:08:30.351 --> 00:08:33.500
<v Speaker 2>that moment with the state of being </v>
<v Speaker 2>required by human mind.</v>

156
00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:34.693
<v Speaker 2>Molecules mingled with wavelengths were </v>
<v Speaker 2>twisted and strewn mislaid shuffled </v>

157
00:08:38.601 --> 00:08:40.370
<v Speaker 2>around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>transmuted and exchanged,</v>

158
00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:43.820
<v Speaker 2>and if afterward only the music remained</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what?</v>

159
00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:45.643
<v Speaker 2>The drug was in full effect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mac kept raising the volume because his </v>

160
00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:51.290
<v Speaker 2>ears kept adjusting and he wanted it to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be loud.</v>

161
00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:53.500
<v Speaker 2>What was he trying to death and what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scab?</v>

162
00:08:53.501 --> 00:08:56.880
<v Speaker 2>Light question still itched at him under</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that noise?</v>

163
00:08:57.450 --> 00:08:58.860
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His secret.</v>

164
00:08:58.861 --> 00:09:02.580
<v Speaker 2>Wish for shelly not to answer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he couldn't have been in his right mind.</v>

165
00:09:02.581 --> 00:09:05.640
<v Speaker 2>This was exactly what he wanted and </v>
<v Speaker 2>being here with her weight on him.</v>

166
00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:06.683
<v Speaker 2>Six months of uppers and the knife's </v>
<v Speaker 2>edge stress knife's edge stress of </v>

167
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:13.320
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] card rooms had set a system </v>
<v Speaker 2>on a dangerous tempo.</v>

168
00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:16.140
<v Speaker 2>What was the motive for going to that </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole?</v>

169
00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:18.390
<v Speaker 2>He couldn't remember what we didn't want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

170
00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:24.630
<v Speaker 2>but loan end did that to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the kind of place that magnetized</v>

171
00:09:24.631 --> 00:09:25.464
<v Speaker 2>it's population.</v>

172
00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:26.303
<v Speaker 2>Even the slightest relaxation of purpose</v>
<v Speaker 2>would be enough to persuade an Erin </v>

173
00:09:29.461 --> 00:09:30.294
<v Speaker 2>traveler that it was time he ought to go</v>
<v Speaker 2>home and it is sometimes said that </v>

174
00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:36.120
<v Speaker 2>wherever alone inborn folk go in their </v>
<v Speaker 2>lives,</v>

175
00:09:36.121 --> 00:09:40.100
<v Speaker 2>no matter the distance or duration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they always die in loan end.</v>

176
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:45.360
<v Speaker 2>Shelly's daughter Lisa awoken by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>music that could not be loud enough,</v>

177
00:09:45.361 --> 00:09:46.194
<v Speaker 2>trudged into the living room and found </v>
<v Speaker 2>her mother completely stoned on the </v>

178
00:09:48.931 --> 00:09:52.170
<v Speaker 2>couch with a man of whom she had only </v>
<v Speaker 2>the faintest recollection.</v>

179
00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:55.020
<v Speaker 2>Lisa knew very little about drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but enough to knew,</v>

180
00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:57.360
<v Speaker 2>know what it looked like when you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>on them.</v>

181
00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:58.433
<v Speaker 2>Shelly seeing Lisa and her peach colored</v>
<v Speaker 2>pajamas clutching a teddy bear that had </v>

182
00:10:01.051 --> 00:10:03.600
<v Speaker 2>been patched and repatch dozens of </v>
<v Speaker 2>times,</v>

183
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:06.060
<v Speaker 2>shot up from the couch and tried to act </v>
<v Speaker 2>authoritative.</v>

184
00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:07.290
<v Speaker 2>Lisa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are you up?</v>

185
00:10:07.291 --> 00:10:10.280
<v Speaker 2>Do you want some water or do you need </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything?</v>

186
00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:13.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean to yell at you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The music was loud.</v>

187
00:10:13.351 --> 00:10:16.740
<v Speaker 2>She said I couldn't sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Her eyes were fixed on Mac,</v>

188
00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:18.690
<v Speaker 2>who smile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>suggested friendliness,</v>

189
00:10:18.691 --> 00:10:22.410
<v Speaker 2>but she had been fooled by looks before </v>
<v Speaker 2>she chose to distrust him.</v>

190
00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:24.180
<v Speaker 2>Haley said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>remember me?</v>

191
00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:27.840
<v Speaker 2>All she said was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you turn it down please?</v>

192
00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:29.243
<v Speaker 2>And the little girl walked back to her </v>
<v Speaker 2>room fainting all the disappointment of </v>

193
00:10:32.761 --> 00:10:34.350
<v Speaker 2>a mother.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mac.</v>

194
00:10:34.351 --> 00:10:35.580
<v Speaker 2>You asked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>turn it down.</v>

195
00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:36.810
<v Speaker 2>And he did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

196
00:10:36.811 --> 00:10:38.970
<v Speaker 2>this is a disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why don't I let you ruin everything?</v>

197
00:10:38.971 --> 00:10:40.230
<v Speaker 2>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck.</v>

198
00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.153
<v Speaker 2>She knocked the porcelain jar off the </v>
<v Speaker 2>coffee table and the little blue tablet </v>

199
00:10:43.421 --> 00:10:44.254
<v Speaker 2>spilled and we're lost in the shaggy </v>
<v Speaker 2>fibers of the carpet in that very </v>

200
00:10:47.671 --> 00:10:48.504
<v Speaker 2>moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shelley grave swore off Zena friend to </v>

201
00:10:50.551 --> 00:10:51.384
<v Speaker 2>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So mortified to what she thought her </v>

202
00:10:52.561 --> 00:10:53.394
<v Speaker 2>daughter thought she was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this was her character's nightly </v>

203
00:10:56.761 --> 00:10:59.760
<v Speaker 2>promise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like the other was never to be kept.</v>

204
00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:03.150
<v Speaker 2>Please go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She whispered and left him there.</v>

205
00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:08.520
<v Speaker 2>Instinctively mack went for the tablets </v>
<v Speaker 2>that had been strewn in the Sylvan Rug,</v>

206
00:11:08.521 --> 00:11:11.130
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tasked that prove more difficult than it</v>

207
00:11:11.131 --> 00:11:11.964
<v Speaker 2>should have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The drugs still had a strong hold over </v>

208
00:11:13.021 --> 00:11:13.854
<v Speaker 2>him now instead of no thought ideas came</v>
<v Speaker 2>swarming into his head like beads </v>

209
00:11:17.311 --> 00:11:20.010
<v Speaker 2>converging again and again on the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>conclusion.</v>

210
00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:21.353
<v Speaker 2>My reality is on a loop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never had he felt more sure about </v>

211
00:11:24.931 --> 00:11:25.764
<v Speaker 2>something than this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He rewound the day in his head and </v>

212
00:11:27.301 --> 00:11:28.134
<v Speaker 2>played it over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did the same with the previous six </v>

213
00:11:29.431 --> 00:11:32.970
<v Speaker 2>months and before repeated occurrences </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the same night this night,</v>

214
00:11:32.971 --> 00:11:36.630
<v Speaker 2>laid out like sardines in a tin and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>all seems so pathetic.</v>

215
00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:40.080
<v Speaker 2>The did he have no control over this sad</v>
<v Speaker 2>circle of events.</v>

216
00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:41.123
<v Speaker 2>He looked down at the handful of blue </v>
<v Speaker 2>tablets and new at once that they were </v>

217
00:11:44.311 --> 00:11:45.870
<v Speaker 2>the root cause of his problems.</v>

218
00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:48.143
<v Speaker 2>He heard it to the kitchen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>desperate to maintain control over his </v>

219
00:11:49.921 --> 00:11:53.590
<v Speaker 2>mind before the other part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the stone sucker part could reclaim it.</v>

220
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:54.543
<v Speaker 2>He lifted up the dirty plates in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sink and drop the pills into the </v>

221
00:11:57.461 --> 00:11:58.810
<v Speaker 2>disposal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

222
00:11:58.930 --> 00:11:59.763
<v Speaker 2>cut off the supply.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eliminate the opportunity for desire to </v>

223
00:12:02.051 --> 00:12:04.600
<v Speaker 2>prey on the weaker self.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No indulgence.</v>

224
00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:05.493
<v Speaker 2>He exhaled and out came everything bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>overcooked fish wafted from the nearby </v>

225
00:12:12.431 --> 00:12:13.300
<v Speaker 2>stovetop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mac.</v>

226
00:12:13.301 --> 00:12:15.370
<v Speaker 2>Wondered again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where did Shelly get fish from?</v>

227
00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:17.860
<v Speaker 2>He was sure that she didn't have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>money for food.</v>

228
00:12:17.861 --> 00:12:21.580
<v Speaker 2>That rare sense memory set off a tiny </v>
<v Speaker 2>projector in his head,</v>

229
00:12:21.581 --> 00:12:22.414
<v Speaker 2>a tangled dream of gatherings at his </v>
<v Speaker 2>uncle Warren's restaurant on catskill </v>

<v Speaker 2>Koten was lawless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Free from that bewildering rainbow of </v>

242
00:13:04.331 --> 00:13:05.164
<v Speaker 2>authority.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The light there was always the same </v>

243
00:13:06.641 --> 00:13:08.200
<v Speaker 2>color,</v>
<v Speaker 2>harsh white,</v>

244
00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:12.130
<v Speaker 2>raining like a God over octagonal </v>
<v Speaker 2>octagonal card tables,</v>

245
00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:13.143
<v Speaker 2>concealing the eyes of your opponents </v>
<v Speaker 2>and turning the heads of emaciated </v>

246
00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:19.090
<v Speaker 2>amateurs like Mac into small,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chalky skulls.</v>

247
00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:20.433
<v Speaker 2>It was also deliberately organize to </v>
<v Speaker 2>throw you off balance by who the hell </v>

248
00:13:25.451 --> 00:13:26.284
<v Speaker 2>you knew that going in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At least there you can really lose </v>

249
00:13:27.461 --> 00:13:30.370
<v Speaker 2>yourself at least there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could piss in the streets,</v>

250
00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:33.560
<v Speaker 2>whichever authority it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The light broke.</v>

251
00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:36.820
<v Speaker 2>His trans and Mac was suddenly overcome </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a wild hunger.</v>

252
00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:37.833
<v Speaker 2>He scraped the burnt leftover fish from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the skillet and slapped it onto a dirty </v>

253
00:13:41.831 --> 00:13:44.320
<v Speaker 2>plate in the cupboard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a bottle of Bourbon.</v>

254
00:13:44.321 --> 00:13:48.400
<v Speaker 2>Another odd thing to find at Shelly's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He ate slowly like a beast,</v>

255
00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:51.970
<v Speaker 2>staving off the urge to devour it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>prize in one great bite.</v>

256
00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:55.360
<v Speaker 2>Fish after all was nothing to sneeze at </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Bourbon,</v>

257
00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:59.530
<v Speaker 2>the life of a king.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His uncle love Berman always had a glass</v>

258
00:13:59.531 --> 00:14:02.050
<v Speaker 2>with dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe she got the gift from Warren,</v>

259
00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:03.670
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fish for more and as a gift.</v>

260
00:14:03.671 --> 00:14:07.130
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the truth was there</v>

261
00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:11.650
<v Speaker 2>on his plate in his glass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mocking him.</v>

262
00:14:11.651 --> 00:14:14.320
<v Speaker 2>The clever bitch fish every night if she</v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted it,</v>

263
00:14:14.321 --> 00:14:18.520
<v Speaker 2>free alcohol all in exchange for </v>
<v Speaker 2>turbulent sex and the occasional dose of</v>

264
00:14:18.521 --> 00:14:19.354
<v Speaker 2>Xeno.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He rushed at the thought of all that </v>

265
00:14:20.501 --> 00:14:23.200
<v Speaker 2>full acid skin perspiring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>greasy.</v>

266
00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:25.780
<v Speaker 2>And what did they say about him in bed </v>
<v Speaker 2>afterwards?</v>

267
00:14:25.781 --> 00:14:27.940
<v Speaker 2>That he was a joke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making a fool of himself.</v>

268
00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:30.790
<v Speaker 2>Could they guess when he'd returned a </v>
<v Speaker 2>broken record?</v>

269
00:14:30.791 --> 00:14:33.040
<v Speaker 2>That boy he heard it loud and clear in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the kitchen.</v>

270
00:14:33.041 --> 00:14:36.520
<v Speaker 2>Silence no more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He scrambled into Shelly's bedroom,</v>

271
00:14:36.521 --> 00:14:37.354
<v Speaker 2>found her curled up in a ball under the </v>
<v Speaker 2>covers and in one vicious motion kicked </v>

272
00:14:41.771 --> 00:14:44.050
<v Speaker 2>her from the bed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the wait was wrong.</v>

273
00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:44.973
<v Speaker 2>He felt it immediately to light.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The small body crashed into the far </v>

274
00:14:48.881 --> 00:14:49.930
<v Speaker 2>wall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At first,</v>

275
00:14:49.931 --> 00:14:54.460
<v Speaker 2>the little girl scream came as if from </v>
<v Speaker 2>far away and then.</v>

276
00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:55.633
<v Speaker 2>And then it was right there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cleaving him into shelly found her </v>

277
00:14:59.241 --> 00:15:01.800
<v Speaker 2>daughter strewn on the floor like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>ragdoll.</v>

278
00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:02.653
<v Speaker 2>The girl's neck had hit the protruding </v>
<v Speaker 2>window sill and this sent her into </v>

279
00:15:05.901 --> 00:15:10.190
<v Speaker 2>severe convulsions of bent nerve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably appendages thrashed against the</v>

280
00:15:10.191 --> 00:15:13.400
<v Speaker 2>pho wood paneling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Quick sonorous studs,</v>

281
00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:15.770
<v Speaker 2>Lisa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lisa,</v>

282
00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:18.140
<v Speaker 2>she nailed over her daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Completely helpless.</v>

283
00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:20.420
<v Speaker 2>You weren't supposed to touch a seizing </v>
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>

284
00:15:20.421 --> 00:15:21.920
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She couldn't remember.</v>

285
00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:24.610
<v Speaker 2>Mack was in shock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His leg,</v>

286
00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:28.280
<v Speaker 2>his legs moved as if by another brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>slowly out of the room.</v>

287
00:15:28.281 --> 00:15:29.114
<v Speaker 2>His body was taking the necessary steps </v>
<v Speaker 2>to extricate itself from the </v>

288
00:15:31.881 --> 00:15:34.460
<v Speaker 2>repercussions of this horrible accident </v>
<v Speaker 2>and accident.</v>

289
00:15:34.461 --> 00:15:36.710
<v Speaker 2>That's what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could he be blamed for it?</v>

290
00:15:36.711 --> 00:15:39.440
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Images spilled into his head randomly.</v>

291
00:15:39.441 --> 00:15:42.620
<v Speaker 2>Uncle Warren drinking bourbon from a </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspiring glass.</v>

292
00:15:42.621 --> 00:15:45.140
<v Speaker 2>The gruff sniggers have better gambler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something strange.</v>

293
00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.810
<v Speaker 2>The strap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the scratch on his mothers coffin.</v>

294
00:15:47.811 --> 00:15:48.980
<v Speaker 2>How did it get there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yes,</v>

295
00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:51.350
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a rock hidden in the shovel of</v>

296
00:15:51.351 --> 00:15:52.184
<v Speaker 2>dirt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was supposed to dump over the casket </v>

297
00:15:53.341 --> 00:15:54.174
<v Speaker 2>at drew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a line directly above her knees or her </v>

298
00:15:55.641 --> 00:15:56.474
<v Speaker 2>shoulders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He couldn't recall what side the head </v>

299
00:15:57.891 --> 00:16:01.880
<v Speaker 2>was on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Lisa twitching like a broken doll.</v>

300
00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:07.040
<v Speaker 2>He found himself in the kitchen again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>standing over the sink.</v>

301
00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:09.830
<v Speaker 2>Lisa seizure was only a faint tapping in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the room.</v>

302
00:16:09.831 --> 00:16:10.664
<v Speaker 2>Beyond Dalen the disposal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could see the small pile of blue </v>

303
00:16:13.521 --> 00:16:16.510
<v Speaker 2>tablets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why had he gotten rid of the Xeno?</v>

304
00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:17.863
<v Speaker 2>Think of the money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was throwing away stupid to throw </v>

305
00:16:18.981 --> 00:16:21.320
<v Speaker 2>away all that money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would need it now.</v>

306
00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:22.483
<v Speaker 2>He reached down the tapping ceased </v>
<v Speaker 2>silence and then city reflection boomed </v>

307
00:16:27.231 --> 00:16:28.460
<v Speaker 2>from the living room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Television.</v>

308
00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:30.650
<v Speaker 2>Mac turned around to see who had turned </v>
<v Speaker 2>it on,</v>

309
00:16:30.651 --> 00:16:34.340
<v Speaker 2>but nobody was there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A contract auto voice called out strange</v>

310
00:16:34.341 --> 00:16:37.760
<v Speaker 2>lyrics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the creaking of the tented sky,</v>

311
00:16:37.761 --> 00:16:42.470
<v Speaker 2>the ticking of eternity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw and heard a new atlast the how and</v>

312
00:16:42.471 --> 00:16:43.304
<v Speaker 2>why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of all things past and present and </v>

313
00:16:45.681 --> 00:16:47.630
<v Speaker 2>forevermore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The universe,</v>

314
00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:52.780
<v Speaker 2>cliff to the core,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lay open to my probing sense and augury.</v>

315
00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:54.973
<v Speaker 2>That's what it felt like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Had he succeeded in derailing the </v>

316
00:16:57.801 --> 00:16:59.750
<v Speaker 2>looping story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

317
00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:00.763
<v Speaker 2>Mac turned around to the sink and was </v>
<v Speaker 2>startled to see shelley there standing </v>

318
00:17:03.531 --> 00:17:06.080
<v Speaker 2>before him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Her face as cold as the night.</v>

319
00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:09.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said or did she say it?</v>

320
00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:12.800
<v Speaker 2>Her finger was flushed on a light </v>
<v Speaker 2>switch,</v>

321
00:17:12.801 --> 00:17:15.920
<v Speaker 2>but he observed no light turn on or off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When he flipped it,</v>

322
00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:17.143
<v Speaker 2>moisture on his cheek.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mack looked down to see his hand being </v>

323
00:17:20.330 --> 00:17:25.250
<v Speaker 2>torn apart by blades,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so swift and sharp that at first he felt</v>

324
00:17:25.251 --> 00:17:30.251
<v Speaker 2>no pain and then the pain came and Mac </v>
<v Speaker 2>ludgate saw the whole thing.</v>
