00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:06.323
<v Speaker 1>Sentence should swing the sword.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget what you are the rest of the </v>

2
00:00:10.051 --> 00:00:10.884
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not just sticking with the </v>

3
00:00:11.241 --> 00:00:12.074
<v Speaker 1>printing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The mind needs books like a sword needs </v>

4
00:00:13.981 --> 00:00:16.250
<v Speaker 1>a wet stone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Love comes in at the eyes,</v>

5
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.153
<v Speaker 1>the occasional kindness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We spend all sorts of trouble down the </v>

6
00:00:18.721 --> 00:00:19.554
<v Speaker 1>road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't think someone says before the </v>

7
00:00:20.371 --> 00:00:23.350
<v Speaker 1>word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but mainly council desires I've added.</v>

8
00:00:23.351 --> 00:00:24.184
<v Speaker 1>It's to align with the phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Purse is only one God and his name is </v>

9
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:29.993
<v Speaker 1>Mayan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't concern himself with the </v>

10
00:00:31.021 --> 00:00:33.630
<v Speaker 1>opinions of a sheep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you play the game of thrones,</v>

11
00:00:33.631 --> 00:00:36.740
<v Speaker 1>you're when you're dying and only by </v>
<v Speaker 1>admitting what we are,</v>

12
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:37.583
<v Speaker 1>can we get what we want?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always the innocence was going to </v>

13
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.833
<v Speaker 1>die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be with a song in my hot water is </v>

14
00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.063
<v Speaker 1>honor compared to a woman to love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doug is coming for all of us like crap </v>

15
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.923
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say the goes through life with his </v>

16
00:00:52.621 --> 00:00:52.960
<v Speaker 1>bathroom.</v>

17
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.960
<v Speaker 1>Lines are down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can often be blind to the innovators</v>

18
00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.170
<v Speaker 1>of your side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God's wanting us to have to take will be</v>

19
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.023
<v Speaker 1>dyed or anything with a cook is easy to </v>
<v Speaker 1>full power resides when then believe it </v>

20
00:01:07.501 --> 00:01:10.280
<v Speaker 1>resides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no appeal for being a good act.</v>

21
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.020
<v Speaker 1>Does not wash out the bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad,</v>

22

<v Speaker 1>good amount is what are the say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is.</v>

23
00:01:15.211 --> 00:01:17.370
<v Speaker 1>I know more Spanish to be cruel than </v>
<v Speaker 1>weak.</v>

24
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.890
<v Speaker 1>No one can survive in this world without</v>
<v Speaker 1>how.</v>

25
00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:20.813
<v Speaker 1>The more people you love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way you treat your oath recklessly </v>

26
00:01:23.401 --> 00:01:25.770
<v Speaker 1>and your people will do the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People shouldn't live anywhere.</v>

27
00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.080
<v Speaker 1>You need to burn shit to keep warm </v>
<v Speaker 1>jugglers.</v>

28
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.490

<v Speaker 1>Plos influence grows like a weed.</v>

29
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.533
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Severity is the price we pay for </v>

30
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.173
<v Speaker 1>greatness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a rare enough seeing man who lives </v>

31
00:01:41.501 --> 00:01:44.500
<v Speaker 1>up to his reputation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter what we want.</v>

32
00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.130
<v Speaker 1>Once we get it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we want something else.</v>

33
00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.360
<v Speaker 1>You waste time trying to get people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>love you.</v>

34
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.930
<v Speaker 1>You'll end up the most popular man in </v>
<v Speaker 1>town.</v>

35
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.580
