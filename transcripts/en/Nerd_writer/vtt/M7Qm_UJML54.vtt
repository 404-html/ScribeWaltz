1
00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:03.613
<v Speaker 1>First Grade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scifi cover artist was frank or Paul </v>

2
00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:10.510
<v Speaker 1>discovered by the father of science </v>
<v Speaker 1>fiction publisher Hugo Gernsback.</v>

3
00:00:10.511 --> 00:00:11.344
<v Speaker 1>In 1914,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paul define the imagery that came to be </v>

4
00:00:13.991 --> 00:00:18.100
<v Speaker 1>associated with Scifi tails is covers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have amazing stories.</v>

5
00:00:18.101 --> 00:00:21.070
<v Speaker 1>The first magazine devoted solely to </v>
<v Speaker 1>this new genre,</v>

6
00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.980
<v Speaker 1>features,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spectacular spaceships and spacemen,</v>

7
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.020
<v Speaker 1>giant insects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>laser guns,</v>

8
00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.010
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of really odd looking aliens </v>
<v Speaker 1>in those years.</v>

9
00:00:30.011 --> 00:00:30.844
<v Speaker 1>The middle 19 twenties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These covers were probably among the </v>

10
00:00:33.491 --> 00:00:37.990
<v Speaker 1>strangest art that the average American </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever got to see on news stands,</v>

11
00:00:37.991 --> 00:00:38.824
<v Speaker 1>these colorful garish nightmare visions </v>
<v Speaker 1>and leaped into the imaginations of </v>

12
00:00:42.881 --> 00:00:43.714
<v Speaker 1>young readers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paul is such a towering figure in </v>

13
00:00:45.561 --> 00:00:46.394
<v Speaker 1>science fiction because so many </v>
<v Speaker 1>influential writers and artists in the </v>

14
00:00:49.071 --> 00:00:50.870
<v Speaker 1>field,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to mention readers,</v>

15
00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:51.763
<v Speaker 1>can trace their obsession with the genre</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the unforgettable experience of </v>

16
00:00:55.311 --> 00:00:58.640
<v Speaker 1>seeing his covers for the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The purpose of a book cover,</v>

17
00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:59.653
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to draw you in to peak your interest </v>

18
00:01:01.551 --> 00:01:04.910
<v Speaker 1>enough to read the story behind it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but on these covers,</v>

19
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.800
<v Speaker 1>paul launched a fascinating genre of </v>
<v Speaker 1>painting and design that rarely gets the</v>

20
00:01:09.801 --> 00:01:10.634
<v Speaker 1>attention it deserves in the same way </v>
<v Speaker 1>that science fiction and fantasy as </v>

21
00:01:14.481 --> 00:01:18.360
<v Speaker 1>genres historically didn't get the </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention that they deserved.</v>

22
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.510
<v Speaker 1>Interestingly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the byproducts,</v>

23
00:01:20.511 --> 00:01:21.344
<v Speaker 1>I think of this lack of attention was </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the cover art for these books got </v>

24
00:01:24.111 --> 00:01:24.944
<v Speaker 1>to explore weirder and more avant garde </v>
<v Speaker 1>artistic styles than they would have </v>

25
00:01:28.671 --> 00:01:29.504
<v Speaker 1>otherwise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The revolution inside Fi covers came </v>

26
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:32.383
<v Speaker 1>with a revolution and book selling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In 1939 Robert to graph launched pocket </v>

27
00:01:36.891 --> 00:01:37.724
<v Speaker 1>books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first mass market publisher of </v>

28
00:01:39.771 --> 00:01:43.520
<v Speaker 1>paperbacks in America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was hugely successful and amazing</v>

29
00:01:43.521 --> 00:01:44.354
<v Speaker 1>as it sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one really thought that people would </v>

30
00:01:46.161 --> 00:01:46.994
<v Speaker 1>read paperbacks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when the pocket version of James </v>

31
00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.640
<v Speaker 1>Hilton's last horizon sold two and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>half million copies,</v>

32
00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.870
<v Speaker 1>people knew that there was a change in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the air as marked are noted in the daily</v>

33
00:01:56.871 --> 00:01:57.704
<v Speaker 1>beast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly the four point three by seven </v>

34
00:01:59.451 --> 00:02:00.284
<v Speaker 1>inch format of mass market paperbacks </v>
<v Speaker 1>became the canvas for cover artists and </v>

35
00:02:04.821 --> 00:02:07.820
<v Speaker 1>with more scifi selling and with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>genre getting more of it.</v>

36
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:08.930
<v Speaker 1>Stu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>culturally,</v>

37
00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:13.520
<v Speaker 1>publishers look to artists who could </v>
<v Speaker 1>reflect the deep themes that the story's</v>

38
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.473
<v Speaker 1>explored.</v>

39
00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.630
<v Speaker 1>Take Penguin the British bookseller in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the forties and fifties.</v>

40
00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.500
<v Speaker 1>They were known for their classic orange</v>
<v Speaker 1>and white covers then in the sixties,</v>

41
00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.950
<v Speaker 1>in an effort to raise the sophistication</v>
<v Speaker 1>of their science fiction offering.</v>

42
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.720
<v Speaker 1>Art Director Germano facility started </v>
<v Speaker 1>pairing novels with covers featuring the</v>

43
00:02:29.721 --> 00:02:32.990
<v Speaker 1>work of popular modern artists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

44
00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.853
<v Speaker 1>James publishes a case of conscience </v>
<v Speaker 1>takes place on the planet with organic </v>

45
00:02:37.581 --> 00:02:41.570
<v Speaker 1>almost biological shape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Buildings for the cover for steady chose</v>

46
00:02:41.571 --> 00:02:44.180
<v Speaker 1>a detail from data estin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>surrealist painter,</v>

47
00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.700
<v Speaker 1>Max Ernst,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the eye of silence,</v>

48
00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:47.593
<v Speaker 1>or Jg Ballard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the drowned world of post apocalyptic </v>

49
00:02:50.061 --> 00:02:53.690
<v Speaker 1>novel set in Oblique,</v>
<v Speaker 1>flooded uninhabitable London for this,</v>

50
00:02:53.691 --> 00:02:54.524
<v Speaker 1>for Seti,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chose Eve 10 surreal landscape of </v>

51
00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.370
<v Speaker 1>battered shapes and odd configurations </v>
<v Speaker 1>called the Palace of windowed rocks.</v>

52
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.263
<v Speaker 1>After for Seti,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a series of art directors through the </v>

53
00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:06.700
<v Speaker 1>sixties and seventies commissioned </v>
<v Speaker 1>original works or did it themselves.</v>

54
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:07.803
<v Speaker 1>There was Allen Aldridge who created a </v>
<v Speaker 1>series of beautiful psychedelic images </v>

55
00:03:11.471 --> 00:03:13.450
<v Speaker 1>over black in the late 19 sixties.</v>

56
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:14.553
<v Speaker 1>There was Franco Greg [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>who pioneered methods of experimental </v>

57
00:03:16.841 --> 00:03:21.841
<v Speaker 1>photography resulting in a monochromatic</v>
<v Speaker 1>kaleidoscopic images in 1970.</v>

58
00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.200
<v Speaker 1>Then there was David Pelham who made </v>
<v Speaker 1>this iconic cover for a clockwork orange</v>

59
00:03:26.201 --> 00:03:27.034
<v Speaker 1>in 1972 and these gorgeous reprints of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Ballard classics a few years later </v>

60
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.883
<v Speaker 1>over at ballantine books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was Richard powers who is really </v>

61
00:03:35.291 --> 00:03:36.124
<v Speaker 1>pushing the limits of the form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ballantine's essentially gained </v>

62
00:03:38.531 --> 00:03:39.364
<v Speaker 1>powers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>free reign to pull from all his </v>

63
00:03:40.991 --> 00:03:41.824
<v Speaker 1>modernists and surrealist influences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes pulling completely away from </v>

64
00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.893
<v Speaker 1>the actual content of the book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The result was hundreds of covers that </v>

65
00:03:50.531 --> 00:03:53.770
<v Speaker 1>could have easily filled gallery spaces </v>
<v Speaker 1>and modern art museums,</v>

66
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.680
<v Speaker 1>and while they were increasingly </v>
<v Speaker 1>abstract powers,</v>

67
00:03:56.681 --> 00:03:59.710
<v Speaker 1>covers mind the subconscious in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>surreal,</v>

68
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.873
<v Speaker 1>in the same way that the best science </v>
<v Speaker 1>fiction does the present a world that's </v>

69
00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.690
<v Speaker 1>warped often in radical ways as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>reaction to the world.</v>

70
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.810
<v Speaker 1>That is one of the things I love about </v>
<v Speaker 1>Scifi cover art is how accessible it is,</v>

71
00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.520
<v Speaker 1>like literally accessible.</v>

72
00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:16.383
<v Speaker 1>You can walk into any used bookstore </v>
<v Speaker 1>anywhere and get five of these old pulp </v>

73
00:04:19.191 --> 00:04:20.024
<v Speaker 1>books for a dollar each.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can own a vincent defeat and a Bob </v>

74
00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.390
<v Speaker 1>Pepper and Ian Miller's insane cover for</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bradbury's long after midnight,</v>

75
00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.240
<v Speaker 1>and then the art is with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in your home.</v>

76
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.820
<v Speaker 1>As you read the stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's on your bedside table.</v>

77
00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.820
<v Speaker 1>It's art you hold with your hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not precious.</v>

78
00:04:36.821 --> 00:04:40.960
<v Speaker 1>It's been folded and creased and above </v>
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>

79
00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:42.213
<v Speaker 1>it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scifi and fantasy covers had the chance </v>

80
00:04:44.801 --> 00:04:45.634
<v Speaker 1>to be weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only because of the weird things </v>

81
00:04:46.661 --> 00:04:50.140
<v Speaker 1>going on in the stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because the genre was categorized as</v>

82
00:04:50.141 --> 00:04:53.890
<v Speaker 1>pope and weird imagery sort of came with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the territory.</v>

83
00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.113
<v Speaker 1>There are hundreds of artists and </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands upon thousands of books in </v>

84
00:04:57.551 --> 00:04:59.890
<v Speaker 1>this tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't possibly cover it all here,</v>

85
00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.190
<v Speaker 1>partly because a good amount of it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>forgotten.</v>

86
00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.220
<v Speaker 1>Hiding away in crates at the back of </v>
<v Speaker 1>bookstores.</v>

87
00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.090
<v Speaker 1>Next time you're at one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pull some of those crates out and see if</v>

88
00:05:10.091 --> 00:05:10.924
<v Speaker 1>you can't find a last chapter in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>eclectic and underappreciated sub genre </v>

89
00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.893
<v Speaker 1>of art history.</v>

90
00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.883
<v Speaker 1>Everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you so much for watching and </v>

<v Speaker 1>Scifi book covers.</v>

92
00:05:24.881 --> 00:05:26.350
<v Speaker 1>I've been wanting to do this video for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>while,</v>

93
00:05:26.351 --> 00:05:28.630
