1
00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.993
<v Speaker 1>So I was just watching the new live </v>
<v Speaker 1>action beauty and the beast teaser </v>

2
00:00:07.721 --> 00:00:08.554
<v Speaker 1>trailer starring Emma Watson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another remake of a 19 nineties Disney </v>

3
00:00:11.471 --> 00:00:14.820
<v Speaker 1>animation film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I noticed that the trailer ends with</v>

4
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.920
<v Speaker 1>two instantly recognizable symbols,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a red rose and an appeal to be our guest</v>

5
00:00:21.911 --> 00:00:22.744
<v Speaker 1>from the first films famous song.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it occurred to me that symbols like </v>

6
00:00:26.021 --> 00:00:30.670
<v Speaker 1>this have come to represent a new kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of emotional currency in Hollywood.</v>

7
00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.460
<v Speaker 1>The currency of intertextuality</v>

8
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.210
<v Speaker 1>picks you out something in a text,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this case,</v>

9
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.240
<v Speaker 1>a movie that is shaped by another text </v>
<v Speaker 1>that could be a film or a book or a play</v>

10
00:00:53.731 --> 00:00:54.564
<v Speaker 1>or a song.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Intertextuality is something that you </v>

11
00:00:56.491 --> 00:00:59.160
<v Speaker 1>can't escape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says oldest storytelling is.</v>

12
00:00:59.161 --> 00:00:59.994
<v Speaker 1>It's how language works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All language reaches back and is </v>

13
00:01:03.031 --> 00:01:03.864
<v Speaker 1>informed by how it was used in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But today there seems to be a new kind </v>

14
00:01:08.581 --> 00:01:12.150
<v Speaker 1>of intertextuality born out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>endless series of sequels,</v>

15
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.810
<v Speaker 1>remakes and reboots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the adaptations and shared universities.</v>

16
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.213
<v Speaker 1>And it's perfectly captured in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>force awakens clip when the Millennium </v>

17
00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:20.723
<v Speaker 1>Falcon is revealed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or later when Han Solo and Chewbacca </v>

18
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.323
<v Speaker 1>board their ship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or later still when bba pulls the cover </v>

19
00:01:27.301 --> 00:01:30.240
<v Speaker 1>off an old friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do we feel in these moments?</v>

20
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.403
<v Speaker 1>It's a bit hard to pinpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but personally I feel a kind of free </v>

21
00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:35.310
<v Speaker 1>sawn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the chill.</v>

22
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.293
<v Speaker 1>Everything I know about the intertextual</v>
<v Speaker 1>object in question unloads onto my mind </v>

23
00:01:39.931 --> 00:01:42.940
<v Speaker 1>like the vision ray gets when she first </v>
<v Speaker 1>touches Luke's.</v>

24
00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.540
<v Speaker 1>This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clumsy or random.</v>

25
00:01:48.541 --> 00:01:49.374
<v Speaker 1>As a block</v>

26
00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:55.243
<v Speaker 1>intertextual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>References can point to genre </v>

27
00:01:56.541 --> 00:01:57.374
<v Speaker 1>conventions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can point to the texts influences </v>

28
00:01:59.481 --> 00:02:03.890
<v Speaker 1>or cultural and historical contexts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in this new generation of films,</v>

29
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:04.753
<v Speaker 1>more and more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the intertextual manifests itself as </v>

30
00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:08.263
<v Speaker 1>objects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People or situations specifically meant </v>

31
00:02:11.241 --> 00:02:13.910
<v Speaker 1>to trigger an emotional response in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>viewer.</v>

32
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.390
<v Speaker 1>It's weaponized intertextuality </v>
<v Speaker 1>goodness.</v>

33
00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:20.563
<v Speaker 1>What's a bit troubling about this trend </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that increasingly I'm seeing films </v>

34
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.740
<v Speaker 1>use this kind of intertextual reference </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a dramatic substitute.</v>

35
00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.023
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why else include Sour Ron in the hobbit </v>

36
00:02:30.891 --> 00:02:31.880
<v Speaker 1>trilogy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

37
00:02:31.881 --> 00:02:36.881
<v Speaker 1>when he appears nowhere in the book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me that [inaudible],</v>

38
00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.660
<v Speaker 1>that whole plot line was included purely</v>
<v Speaker 1>for intertextual payoff,</v>

39
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.450
<v Speaker 1>so you could cash out that feeling of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

40
00:02:44.451 --> 00:02:45.284
<v Speaker 1>this is what these people were doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>decades old series are right for this </v>

41
00:02:47.901 --> 00:02:48.734
<v Speaker 1>kind of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you want a couple of examples of </v>

42
00:02:49.851 --> 00:02:54.470
<v Speaker 1>just how cheap these moments can be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just take a look at two big intertextual</v>

43
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.000
<v Speaker 1>reveals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My name is ka</v>

44
00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.973
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're talking to now a man inside your </v>

45
00:03:03.881 --> 00:03:07.260
<v Speaker 2>head and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll blofeld</v>

46
00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:09.593
<v Speaker 1>surprise motherfuckers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like this or kind of Unicorns </v>

47
00:03:12.141 --> 00:03:14.090
<v Speaker 1>blood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll keep your story alive,</v>

48
00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.230
<v Speaker 1>but only with half a soul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of my favorite TV shows when I was a</v>

49
00:03:18.231 --> 00:03:19.064
<v Speaker 1>teenager was small,</v>
<v Speaker 1>filled by its very nature of that show </v>

50
00:03:21.411 --> 00:03:22.244
<v Speaker 1>was built around intertextual cues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What made the show great the early </v>

51
00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.230
<v Speaker 1>seasons was how it took those cues and </v>
<v Speaker 1>deconstructed them in unexpected ways.</v>

52
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.260
<v Speaker 1>Namely in the friendship of Clark Kent </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Lex Luthor.</v>

53
00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:33.513
<v Speaker 1>Its strength was that fan service </v>
<v Speaker 1>payoffs played second fiddle to deeply </v>

54
00:03:36.941 --> 00:03:40.060
<v Speaker 1>drawn relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the later seasons,</v>

55
00:03:40.061 --> 00:03:40.894
<v Speaker 1>the show began to lean a little too </v>
<v Speaker 1>heavily on intertextual objects at </v>

56
00:03:43.451 --> 00:03:45.490
<v Speaker 1>moments from the superman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kennan,</v>

57
00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:46.383
<v Speaker 1>really DC comics has always had this </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem because it's heroes are </v>

58
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:50.463
<v Speaker 1>mythological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Batman and Superman are the </v>

59
00:03:52.571 --> 00:03:56.860
<v Speaker 1>quintessential intertextual characters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just seeing them at all is exciting,</v>

60
00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:58.203
<v Speaker 1>but the recent Batman v Superman movie </v>
<v Speaker 1>directed by Zack Snyder proved that the </v>

61
00:04:01.601 --> 00:04:02.434
<v Speaker 1>free sign of having these characters on </v>
<v Speaker 1>screen together of having them fight </v>

62
00:04:05.261 --> 00:04:09.520
<v Speaker 1>each other was just no substitute for </v>
<v Speaker 1>strong intelligent drama.</v>

63
00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.640
<v Speaker 1>Snyder had a similar issue with his film</v>
<v Speaker 1>watchman.</v>

64
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.690
<v Speaker 1>Almost every shot in that film is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>compositional Matt to the comic.</v>

65
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.960
<v Speaker 1>It's trying to adapt now for those who </v>
<v Speaker 1>read and love that comment,</v>

66
00:04:19.961 --> 00:04:20.794
<v Speaker 1>there certainly is a thrill and seeing </v>
<v Speaker 1>those frames and experiencing those </v>

67
00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.890
<v Speaker 1>textual moments come beautifully to life</v>
<v Speaker 1>when that's all there is.</v>

68
00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.230
<v Speaker 1>The final feeling is an empty one.</v>

69
00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:34.463
<v Speaker 1>I think when cinematic storytelling is </v>
<v Speaker 1>confined by an economic situation like </v>

70
00:04:37.921 --> 00:04:39.490
<v Speaker 1>this one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where $300,</v>

71
00:04:39.491 --> 00:04:41.490
<v Speaker 1>million dollar bets have to be safe </v>
<v Speaker 1>ones,</v>

72
00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.480
<v Speaker 1>weaponized intertextuality is going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be an inevitable byproduct.</v>

73
00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:46.471
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this year alone,</v>

74
00:04:46.471 --> 00:04:49.110
<v Speaker 1>we have coming up finding dory </v>
<v Speaker 1>independence day,</v>

75
00:04:49.111 --> 00:04:51.960
<v Speaker 1>resurgence ghostbusters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the angry birds movie,</v>

76
00:04:51.961 --> 00:04:53.970
<v Speaker 1>a Jason Bourne sequels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rogue one,</v>

77
00:04:53.971 --> 00:04:54.804
<v Speaker 1>Star Trek beyond warcraft.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Expect to be flooded with weaponized </v>

78
00:04:58.891 --> 00:05:01.380
<v Speaker 1>intertextuality at every turn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As I said before,</v>

79
00:05:01.381 --> 00:05:05.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't think franchises and shared </v>
<v Speaker 1>universes are bad by default,</v>

80
00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:06.413
<v Speaker 1>quite the opposite at their best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They build interpretive communities and </v>

81
00:05:09.271 --> 00:05:12.840
<v Speaker 1>foster social bonds and increasingly </v>
<v Speaker 1>alienated world.</v>

82
00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.943
<v Speaker 1>The kind of intertextuality that we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about can reflect these good </v>

83
00:05:16.741 --> 00:05:18.570
<v Speaker 1>qualities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then when it's done right,</v>

84
00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.840
<v Speaker 1>when it's not a substitute for strong </v>
<v Speaker 1>characters and a good story,</v>

85
00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.890
<v Speaker 1>it can be funny excluding America and go</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck yourself.</v>

86
00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:26.783
<v Speaker 1>It can be amusingly subversive and of </v>
<v Speaker 1>course it can add to the drama while </v>

87
00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.540
<v Speaker 1>still being exciting as hell.</v>

88
00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:46.760
<v Speaker 1>Hey everybody.</v>

<v Speaker 1>video on taxes.</v>

96
00:06:03.921 --> 00:06:05.720
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think that we'd get a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>views,</v>

97
00:06:05.721 --> 00:06:07.490
<v Speaker 1>but people really seem to like it.</v>
