1
00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:03.240
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of all the established directors working</v>

2
00:00:03.241 --> 00:00:04.074
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the one that would feel most at </v>

3
00:00:05.551 --> 00:00:06.384
<v Speaker 1>home in my world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world of the video essay is Edgar </v>

4
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.150
<v Speaker 1>Wright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See basically what I do here every week,</v>

5
00:00:12.151 --> 00:00:12.984
<v Speaker 1>like any SAS is make an argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The difference between me and Say New </v>

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.833
<v Speaker 1>York Times columnist Paul Krugman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>besides a phd in economics and like </v>

7
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.410
<v Speaker 1>accolades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that I use video to make my arguments</v>

8
00:00:25.411 --> 00:00:28.050
<v Speaker 1>where he has only language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even so,</v>

9
00:00:28.051 --> 00:00:28.884
<v Speaker 1>our goals are the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To make a persuasive and engaging </v>

10
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.550
<v Speaker 1>argument and just like writers pay close</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention to the flow of their words.</v>

11
00:00:35.551 --> 00:00:39.210
<v Speaker 1>Carefully crafting the transitions from </v>
<v Speaker 1>one idea to the next.</v>

12
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.250
<v Speaker 1>I see the rhythm and momentum of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>videos as crucial to their effectiveness</v>

13
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:45.623
<v Speaker 1>and here's where I can learn a lot from </v>
<v Speaker 1>a garage and I get back to you on the </v>

14
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.250
<v Speaker 1>right is a master of rhythm.</v>

15
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.263
<v Speaker 1>What you just saw as one of many </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary scene transitions from </v>

16
00:00:57.091 --> 00:01:00.900
<v Speaker 1>Scott pilgrim vs the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It lasts about four and a half seconds,</v>

17
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.720
<v Speaker 1>but it's worth taking a second slower </v>
<v Speaker 1>look.</v>

18
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.140
<v Speaker 1>This transition is all about movement to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right.</v>

19
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.260
<v Speaker 1>It kicks off with Anna Kendrick looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>to camera,</v>

20
00:01:10.261 --> 00:01:12.060
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the direction of the movement,</v>

21
00:01:12.061 --> 00:01:15.060
<v Speaker 1>but she's also looking at her brother </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the splitscreen.</v>

22
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.290
<v Speaker 1>Her splitscreen is key framed off to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>left and so is Scott pilgrims,</v>

23
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.520
<v Speaker 1>but right as cleverly positioned him </v>
<v Speaker 1>left in the frame so we can bring in the</v>

24
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:24.383
<v Speaker 1>unseen right hand part of the shot to </v>
<v Speaker 1>extend the Dolly Wipe and the right of </v>

25
00:01:28.171 --> 00:01:29.004
<v Speaker 1>that frame is the arm chair which wipes </v>
<v Speaker 1>across to reveal the next outdoor </v>

26
00:01:32.281 --> 00:01:35.700
<v Speaker 1>setting and the UNIMOG appeal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Letters of the school bell aid.</v>

27
00:01:35.701 --> 00:01:36.534
<v Speaker 1>This transition into a shot that </v>
<v Speaker 1>continues the motion by actually </v>

28
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.040
<v Speaker 1>dollying to the right.</v>

29
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.170
<v Speaker 1>If you were to diagram out this </v>
<v Speaker 1>transition,</v>

30
00:01:43.171 --> 00:01:44.004
<v Speaker 1>it would look a little like this and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>gives you a better sense of just how </v>

31
00:01:46.681 --> 00:01:49.530
<v Speaker 1>much care is put into a handful of </v>
<v Speaker 1>frames.</v>

32
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.880
<v Speaker 1>The transitions are a site of </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity for Edgar right there.</v>

33
00:01:53.881 --> 00:01:54.714
<v Speaker 1>Not only an opportunity for visual jokes</v>
<v Speaker 1>as my friend Tony explored briefly in </v>

34
00:01:58.531 --> 00:02:00.450
<v Speaker 1>another video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I'll link to right here.</v>

35
00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.860
<v Speaker 1>There are a chance to build important </v>
<v Speaker 1>connective tissue that brings the viewer</v>

36
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:06.420
<v Speaker 1>through the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

37
00:02:06.421 --> 00:02:08.940
<v Speaker 1>I think a story is a lot like an </v>
<v Speaker 1>argument.</v>

38
00:02:08.941 --> 00:02:11.690
<v Speaker 1>It has to be persuasive to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scott,</v>

39
00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.680
<v Speaker 1>he only played one note for that entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>song in the beginning of this movie.</v>

40
00:02:16.681 --> 00:02:17.514
<v Speaker 1>Scott pilgrim is a drift.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The breakup that defined his life for </v>

41
00:02:20.521 --> 00:02:24.120
<v Speaker 1>the past year is no longer an excuse for</v>
<v Speaker 1>his sour attitude.</v>

42
00:02:24.121 --> 00:02:28.740
<v Speaker 1>He begins a relationship with a 17 year </v>
<v Speaker 1>old that's clearly not serious to him,</v>

43
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.200
<v Speaker 1>and he's kind of just floating through </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

44
00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.230
<v Speaker 1>It's a feeling that I'm sure a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are familiar with.</v>

45
00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.123
<v Speaker 1>I know I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When everything sort of melts together </v>

46
00:02:37.531 --> 00:02:38.364
<v Speaker 1>and you skip around in time from place </v>
<v Speaker 1>to place to communicate this feeling </v>

47
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.290
<v Speaker 1>right melts together the transitions </v>
<v Speaker 1>between settings.</v>

48
00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.490
<v Speaker 1>He utilizes a few techniques to do this </v>
<v Speaker 1>on Scott State with knives for example,</v>

49
00:02:50.491 --> 00:02:54.750
<v Speaker 1>there are a series of frame wipes that </v>
<v Speaker 1>use diabetic moving objects.</v>

50
00:02:54.751 --> 00:02:55.584
<v Speaker 1>Usually people that are so seamless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they momentarily trick the brain into </v>

51
00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.350
<v Speaker 1>not registering the transition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's more?</v>

52
00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.490
<v Speaker 1>These wipes are all accompanied by sound</v>
<v Speaker 1>effects,</v>

53
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.520
<v Speaker 1>which are also diabetic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a car,</v>

54
00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.520
<v Speaker 1>a skateboard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wrestling of clothes hangers,</v>

55
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.930
<v Speaker 1>or the beep of a sliding door all </v>
<v Speaker 1>pulling deeper into the world.</v>

56
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.910
<v Speaker 1>You also have shots where the reverse </v>
<v Speaker 1>shot is matched in framing,</v>

57
00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.910
<v Speaker 1>but in a totally different location.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

58
00:03:21.911 --> 00:03:25.980
<v Speaker 1>this is really cool because right is </v>
<v Speaker 1>using the rules of cinema against you.</v>

59
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.833
<v Speaker 1>You're not trained to think that a scene</v>
<v Speaker 1>transition could come between a shot </v>

60
00:03:29.321 --> 00:03:31.840
<v Speaker 1>reverse shot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're already engaging with the next</v>

61
00:03:31.841 --> 00:03:35.350
<v Speaker 1>place before you realize that you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>left the last one.</v>

62
00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:36.733
<v Speaker 1>When you think back on this sequence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to remember all the locations </v>

63
00:03:39.731 --> 00:03:43.630
<v Speaker 1>as distinct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly what Scott is feeling.</v>

64
00:03:43.631 --> 00:03:44.464
<v Speaker 1>I told you like 50 times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>party retard all throughout Scott </v>

65
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:48.161
<v Speaker 1>Pilgrim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

66
00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:50.920
<v Speaker 1>Never misses a chance to use a creative </v>
<v Speaker 1>transition,</v>

67
00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:52.990
<v Speaker 1>whether it's from scene to scene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh hey,</v>

68
00:03:52.991 --> 00:03:57.640
<v Speaker 1>it's tonight at the run or within scenes</v>
<v Speaker 1>from shot to shot.</v>

69
00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.210
<v Speaker 1>I think the overall effect of this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>two fold.</v>

70
00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.073
<v Speaker 1>Not only do the wipes and whip pans and </v>
<v Speaker 1>match cuts draw you along the story as </v>

71
00:04:06.161 --> 00:04:06.994
<v Speaker 1>it unfolds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they also make you into a more </v>

72
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.280
<v Speaker 1>observant viewer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're transitions that disappeared the</v>

73
00:04:12.281 --> 00:04:16.120
<v Speaker 1>first time you watch and stand out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>second time or vice versa.</v>

74
00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:17.453
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where exactly is the scene transition </v>

75
00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:20.523
<v Speaker 1>here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's happening completely off screen or </v>

76
00:04:22.691 --> 00:04:25.840
<v Speaker 1>rather behind the screen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My guess is either that the house set is</v>

77
00:04:25.841 --> 00:04:26.674
<v Speaker 1>on wheels or the bathroom itself is </v>
<v Speaker 1>being spun around to face another </v>

78
00:04:28.931 --> 00:04:30.550
<v Speaker 1>backdrop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whichever it is.</v>

79
00:04:30.551 --> 00:04:31.384
<v Speaker 1>The transition is disorienting in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>best way and because what's happening </v>

80
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:35.553
<v Speaker 1>isn't possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're encouraged to sort of put the </v>

81
00:04:38.231 --> 00:04:43.120
<v Speaker 1>film together and interactivity that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>appropriate in a movie about gaming.</v>

82
00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.073
<v Speaker 1>What's important is that the film goer </v>
<v Speaker 1>is involved and engrossed at the same </v>

83
00:04:47.951 --> 00:04:48.784
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This delicate balance is achieved </v>

84
00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.650
<v Speaker 1>through transitions that are often </v>
<v Speaker 1>lyrical,</v>

85
00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.160
<v Speaker 1>like a kind of visual poetry in the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>unlikely place.</v>

86
00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:02.670
<v Speaker 1>It might be worth noting too that Scott </v>
<v Speaker 1>pilgrim is a story about a transitionary</v>

87
00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:04.083
<v Speaker 1>period in the hero's slight for period </v>
<v Speaker 1>between knowing who you were and </v>

88
00:05:08.171 --> 00:05:09.004
<v Speaker 1>deciding who you're going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A life's transitions are harder to </v>

89
00:05:13.001 --> 00:05:16.330
<v Speaker 1>navigate than those in film or a video </v>
<v Speaker 1>essay,</v>

90
00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:17.673
<v Speaker 1>but all of them have to be persuasive </v>
<v Speaker 1>and persuasion is about more than the </v>

91
00:05:22.961 --> 00:05:27.310
<v Speaker 1>words or the images or the ideas you </v>
<v Speaker 1>use.</v>

92
00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.830
<v Speaker 1>It's also about how you connect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

93
00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:42.240
<v Speaker 2>Hey everybody.</v>
