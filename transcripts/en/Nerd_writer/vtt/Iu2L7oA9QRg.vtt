1
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.670
<v Speaker 1>The end of the 19th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cigarette existed at the center of a</v>

2
00:00:10.671 --> 00:00:11.504
<v Speaker 1>lot of different cultural forces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one you're looking at right here is </v>

3
00:00:14.451 --> 00:00:15.284
<v Speaker 1>from a painting by Edvard Munch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most famous for another canvas called </v>

4
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.233
<v Speaker 1>screen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This self portrait with cigarette may </v>

5
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.580
<v Speaker 1>two years later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>though less jarring is just as concerned</v>

6
00:00:25.581 --> 00:00:26.414
<v Speaker 1>with monks personal psychology and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dark underside of his identity as the </v>

7
00:00:31.611 --> 00:00:32.444
<v Speaker 1>scream is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to his critics in his hometown of </v>

8
00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.770
<v Speaker 1>Oslow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the portraits dark.</v>

9
00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.270
<v Speaker 1>He's unfinished.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Feeling was not only unfit for art,</v>

10
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.300
<v Speaker 1>it was dangerous to the psychology of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the city and the age as monks.</v>

11
00:00:46.301 --> 00:00:49.640
<v Speaker 1>Self portrait demonstrates he is by no </v>
<v Speaker 1>means a normal man.</v>

12
00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.230
<v Speaker 1>When an artist is abnormal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a shadow is thrown over all his art.</v>

13
00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.040
<v Speaker 1>That's a quote by Johann </v>
<v Speaker 1>Scharffenberger,</v>

14
00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.893
<v Speaker 1>Norwegian medical student who was </v>
<v Speaker 1>echoing align of conservative moral </v>

15
00:01:01.671 --> 00:01:02.504
<v Speaker 1>thinking that feared the decay of </v>
<v Speaker 1>society resulting from art like that </v>

16
00:01:06.261 --> 00:01:08.600
<v Speaker 1>monk and his contemporaries or making.</v>

17
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:09.703
<v Speaker 1>This pessimistic attitude was </v>
<v Speaker 1>popularized in a large book called </v>

18
00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.990
<v Speaker 1>degeneration by this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Max,</v>

19
00:01:14.991 --> 00:01:15.824
<v Speaker 1>nor Nordell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who attacked pretty much every kind of </v>

20
00:01:17.451 --> 00:01:18.284
<v Speaker 1>art that wasn't up to his moral </v>
<v Speaker 1>standards as poisonous and corrupting </v>

21
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:22.783
<v Speaker 1>for Scharfenberg nor Dow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The cigarette was symptomatic of </v>

22
00:01:25.581 --> 00:01:28.640
<v Speaker 1>societies degeneration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was along with alcohol,</v>

23
00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:29.563
<v Speaker 1>one of civilizations ugly indulgences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for monk and his circle of decadent </v>

24
00:01:34.161 --> 00:01:34.994
<v Speaker 1>artists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cigarette was something much </v>

25
00:01:36.621 --> 00:01:37.454
<v Speaker 1>different for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The end of the 19th century also </v>

26
00:01:39.651 --> 00:01:43.820
<v Speaker 1>represented a change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was a chance for a break from the</v>

27
00:01:43.821 --> 00:01:44.654
<v Speaker 1>stale bourgeoisie values,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the prudish and uptight conservative </v>

28
00:01:48.171 --> 00:01:52.520
<v Speaker 1>values of Nortel and his acolytes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In 18 nineties,</v>

29
00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:53.373
<v Speaker 1>Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The cigarette still wasn't all that </v>

30
00:01:54.411 --> 00:01:56.330
<v Speaker 1>popular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Only 10 years earlier,</v>

31
00:01:56.331 --> 00:01:57.164
<v Speaker 1>James Albert bond sack invented a </v>
<v Speaker 1>rolling machine which made it possible </v>

32
00:02:00.021 --> 00:02:04.550
<v Speaker 1>to mass produce 200 cigarettes a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they were still dwarfed by the sales</v>

33
00:02:04.551 --> 00:02:06.140
<v Speaker 1>of cigars and pipes.</v>

34
00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:07.363
<v Speaker 1>The since the beginning when beggars in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Spain took the discarded tobacco from </v>

35
00:02:10.821 --> 00:02:14.360
<v Speaker 1>Cigar Butts and reroll them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The cigarette had always been associated</v>

36
00:02:14.361 --> 00:02:16.670
<v Speaker 1>with the lower classes in the Crimean </v>
<v Speaker 1>war.</v>

37
00:02:16.671 --> 00:02:19.280
<v Speaker 1>Soldiers Roll Tobacco and old </v>
<v Speaker 1>newspapers,</v>

38
00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.313
<v Speaker 1>and by the 18 nineties when machine made</v>
<v Speaker 1>cigarettes were cheaper to produce and </v>

39
00:02:22.851 --> 00:02:23.684
<v Speaker 1>by the working classes of Europe began </v>
<v Speaker 1>adopting the cigarette while the </v>

40
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.120
<v Speaker 1>middleclass especially the men stuck to </v>
<v Speaker 1>their cigars.</v>

41
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.620
<v Speaker 1>This lithograph by Thea fill steenland </v>
<v Speaker 1>captures the feeling perfectly.</v>

42
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:34.573
<v Speaker 1>Notice how the bourgeoisie man clad in </v>
<v Speaker 1>his proper dress and hat uses his cigar </v>

43
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:39.463
<v Speaker 1>to light the cigarette for the man with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the loose color who is clearly of a </v>

44
00:02:42.441 --> 00:02:43.274
<v Speaker 1>lower social standing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was in the lower classes that monk </v>

45
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:46.603
<v Speaker 1>and his Bohemian contemporaries found </v>
<v Speaker 1>their alternative to the suffocating </v>

46
00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:50.773
<v Speaker 1>middleclass value system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They traded in drawing rooms for late </v>

47
00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.980
<v Speaker 1>night cafes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dinner parties for nightclubs and cigars</v>

48
00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.993
<v Speaker 1>for cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cigarettes became the essential prop of </v>

49
00:03:02.021 --> 00:03:05.520
<v Speaker 1>the Bohemian lifestyle in this painting </v>
<v Speaker 1>by mentor Christian Kroger,</v>

50
00:03:05.521 --> 00:03:06.354
<v Speaker 1>you can see a 21 year old edvard monk </v>
<v Speaker 1>lighting up with his friends and fellow </v>

51
00:03:09.521 --> 00:03:12.880
<v Speaker 1>painters in his studio in this etching </v>
<v Speaker 1>by Moog himself.</v>

52
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:13.743
<v Speaker 1>Smoke snakes and fills up the atmosphere</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a cafe where Bohemian intellectuals </v>

53
00:03:18.161 --> 00:03:21.520
<v Speaker 1>of both genders drink and debate art and</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>

54
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:22.743
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything Max nor Dow despised as </v>

55
00:03:25.961 --> 00:03:27.580
<v Speaker 1>critic Patricia Berman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Notes,</v>

56
00:03:27.581 --> 00:03:28.414
<v Speaker 1>Bohemians of the 18 eighties and </v>
<v Speaker 1>nineties embraced the deviancy that </v>

57
00:03:31.601 --> 00:03:32.434
<v Speaker 1>people like Nortel assigned to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They existed somewhere between the </v>

58
00:03:35.831 --> 00:03:40.831
<v Speaker 1>middle class and the NRC of the streets </v>
<v Speaker 1>and their aesthetic revolt was the birth</v>

59
00:03:41.291 --> 00:03:45.660
<v Speaker 1>of what we can see now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was cigarette cool for monks work.</v>

60
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.030
<v Speaker 1>This meant moving away from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>naturalism of his predecessors,</v>

61
00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.850
<v Speaker 1>the scientific recording of the natural </v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

62
00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:52.713
<v Speaker 1>even moving away from impressionism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which monks all as little more than </v>

63
00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:57.333
<v Speaker 1>formal exercises with light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his task would be to dig into his own </v>

64
00:04:00.551 --> 00:04:01.384
<v Speaker 1>psyche and record subjective experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how you get something as </v>

65
00:04:05.501 --> 00:04:06.334
<v Speaker 1>terrifying as the scream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is how dark subjectivity warps the </v>

66
00:04:09.851 --> 00:04:11.980
<v Speaker 1>natural world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As he wrote later,</v>

67
00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.380
<v Speaker 1>I was walking along the road with two </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends.</v>

68
00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.220
<v Speaker 1>The Sun was setting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly the sky turned blood red.</v>

69
00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:19.383
<v Speaker 1>I paused,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling exhausted and leaned on the </v>

70
00:04:20.981 --> 00:04:21.814
<v Speaker 1>fence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was blood and tongues of fire </v>

71
00:04:23.381 --> 00:04:25.780
<v Speaker 1>above the blue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>black fjord and the city.</v>

72
00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:26.643
<v Speaker 1>My friends walked on and I stood there </v>
<v Speaker 1>trembling with anxiety and I sensed an </v>

73
00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.710
<v Speaker 1>infinite screen passing through nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You read any diary or memoir of a suffer</v>

74
00:04:34.961 --> 00:04:39.310
<v Speaker 1>of depression and you'll find similar </v>
<v Speaker 1>moments of disturbing transformation.</v>

75
00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:40.773
<v Speaker 1>The truth is that mental illness was </v>
<v Speaker 1>underscoring this whole transitional </v>

76
00:04:43.751 --> 00:04:44.584
<v Speaker 1>time in history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As nations came to grips with the rapid </v>

77
00:04:46.931 --> 00:04:48.610
<v Speaker 1>growth of anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depression,</v>

78
00:04:48.611 --> 00:04:50.710
<v Speaker 1>mania,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and other mental illnesses,</v>

79
00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:53.410
<v Speaker 1>different groups reacted in different </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways.</v>

80
00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:57.280
<v Speaker 1>It's what's really at the heart of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nordhaus fears of degeneration.</v>

81
00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.060
<v Speaker 1>It's what a number of Bohemian artists </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the era were attempting to explore in</v>

82
00:05:01.061 --> 00:05:01.894
<v Speaker 1>their work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The tragic relationship between madness </v>

83
00:05:04.361 --> 00:05:08.650
<v Speaker 1>and creativity is undeniable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some ran from that fact.</v>

84
00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.500
<v Speaker 1>Others refuse to look away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At this time,</v>

85
00:05:11.501 --> 00:05:14.710
<v Speaker 1>there was a kind of catchall term that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>no longer really in use.</v>

86
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.933
<v Speaker 1>Neurasthenia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's probably more akin </v>

87
00:05:17.681 --> 00:05:18.514
<v Speaker 1>today to acute anxiety or mild mania and</v>
<v Speaker 1>here to the cigarette is significant </v>

88
00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.830
<v Speaker 1>because there was a belief floating </v>
<v Speaker 1>around that cigarette smoking was one of</v>

89
00:05:26.831 --> 00:05:27.664
<v Speaker 1>the causes of insanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A theory put forward in a book by Dr El </v>

90
00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:35.020
<v Speaker 1>Brammer called tobacco insanity and </v>
<v Speaker 1>nervousness and another doctor,</v>

91
00:05:35.021 --> 00:05:35.854
<v Speaker 1>the surgeon Theodore Bill Roth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>believed that the widespread cases of </v>

92
00:05:38.801 --> 00:05:43.180
<v Speaker 1>Neurasthenia and neuroses were due to </v>
<v Speaker 1>alcohol and cigarettes.</v>

93
00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.640
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look again at monks self portrait</v>

94
00:05:45.641 --> 00:05:46.474
<v Speaker 1>with cigarette,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see a nexus of all these social </v>

95
00:05:49.631 --> 00:05:52.480
<v Speaker 1>constructions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Monk is aware of his critics,</v>

96
00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:56.590
<v Speaker 1>their belief in his degeneration and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>cigarette as one of its causes.</v>

97
00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:01.370
<v Speaker 1>He uses it as a formal reason why the </v>
<v Speaker 1>painting is nebulous.</v>

98
00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:02.473
<v Speaker 1>It's shrouded in cigarette smoke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's also using this dissolution by </v>

99
00:06:05.931 --> 00:06:09.950
<v Speaker 1>way of cigarette to signal the </v>
<v Speaker 1>intersection between Bohemian life,</v>

100
00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:14.060
<v Speaker 1>mental illness and art,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the prevalence of mental illness.</v>

101
00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:14.893
<v Speaker 1>It's connection with genius and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>failure of Bourgeoisie moralizing to </v>

102
00:06:18.471 --> 00:06:19.304
<v Speaker 1>come to grips with these realities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He encoded the cigarette as a complex </v>

103
00:06:22.911 --> 00:06:23.744
<v Speaker 1>symbol through which he asserted his </v>
<v Speaker 1>complex identity and created a site of </v>

104
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:28.663
<v Speaker 1>recognition for those who suffer today </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the problem of mental illness </v>

105
00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:33.913
<v Speaker 1>has only grown and its growth has grown </v>
<v Speaker 1>to and we're not that much more </v>

106
00:06:38.331 --> 00:06:41.060
<v Speaker 1>enlightened as to its causes than we </v>
<v Speaker 1>were then.</v>

107
00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:47.220
<v Speaker 1>But I think that monks work is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>constellation because it proves that our</v>

108
00:06:47.811 --> 00:06:48.644
<v Speaker 1>confusion about mental illness in </v>
<v Speaker 1>medicine and science will always be </v>

109
00:06:52.731 --> 00:06:57.731
<v Speaker 1>matched by a probing and nuanced </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding and art of all kinds.</v>

110
00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:06.700
<v Speaker 1>Hey everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for watching.</v>

111
00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:08.510
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to my new apartment in Los </v>
<v Speaker 1>Angeles.</v>

112
00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:12.500
<v Speaker 1>I just moved down here a couple days ago</v>
<v Speaker 1>with my girlfriend and it's actually our</v>

113
00:07:12.501 --> 00:07:15.290
<v Speaker 1>one year anniversary today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you're watching this,</v>

114
00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:18.260
<v Speaker 1>actually you're definitely watching this</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we're in the other room watching</v>

115
