00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.640
<v Speaker 1>Alright baby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's do this thing.</v>

2
00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:04.980
<v Speaker 1>Coffee on a Tuesday and block 39,</v>

3
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:17.083
<v Speaker 1>so I know it's not good to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>politics or religion in polite </v>

4
00:00:19.941 --> 00:00:22.910
<v Speaker 1>conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but flame wars be damned.</v>

5
00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:23.803
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had quite a wonderful time last </v>

6
00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.610
<v Speaker 1>Thursday watching the vice presidential </v>
<v Speaker 1>debate.</v>

7
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.890
<v Speaker 1>It was a hoot and holler and stripped to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the waist,</v>

8
00:00:30.891 --> 00:00:33.080
<v Speaker 1>bare knuckle boxing match,</v>
<v Speaker 1>twix,</v>

9
00:00:33.081 --> 00:00:33.914
<v Speaker 1>Joey Mac and the spell poindexter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The debate range from Libya to Iran to </v>

10
00:00:37.971 --> 00:00:38.804
<v Speaker 1>Medicare to taxes to abortion and Martha</v>
<v Speaker 1>Raddatz was wonderful indeed and though </v>

11
00:00:42.531 --> 00:00:44.900
<v Speaker 1>she held the debate by the scruff of its</v>
<v Speaker 1>neck,</v>

12
00:00:44.901 --> 00:00:45.734
<v Speaker 1>she was not opposed to letting the </v>
<v Speaker 1>opponents slug it out when it came to </v>

13
00:00:48.231 --> 00:00:51.800
<v Speaker 1>blows because that's what they went </v>
<v Speaker 1>there to do.</v>

14
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:52.663
<v Speaker 1>That's democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's take a look at one exchange that </v>

15
00:00:54.891 --> 00:00:55.530
<v Speaker 1>interested me.</v>

16
00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.270
<v Speaker 2>I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not allowed to show letters,</v>

17
00:00:57.271 --> 00:01:00.090
<v Speaker 2>but go on our website.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He sent me two letters saying,</v>

18
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.103
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you send me some stimulus money for </v>

19
00:01:03.961 --> 00:01:06.360
<v Speaker 2>companies here in the State of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Wisconsin?</v>

20
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.343
<v Speaker 2>We sent millions of dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know why he said it asked for </v>

21
00:01:09.781 --> 00:01:11.510
<v Speaker 2>stimulus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

22
00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.080
<v Speaker 2>on two occasions we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

23
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.110
<v Speaker 2>we advocated for</v>

24
00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.000
<v Speaker 1>constituents who are applying for grants</v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

25
00:01:16.001 --> 00:01:16.834
<v Speaker 1>Ryan and the Romney,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ryan ticket and the House Republican </v>

26
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:20.733
<v Speaker 1>Caucus and Senate Republicans and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Republicans generally have spent a lot </v>

27
00:01:22.751 --> 00:01:27.751
<v Speaker 1>of time decrying the efficacy of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>recovery act called by many the stimulus</v>

28
00:01:27.971 --> 00:01:29.950
<v Speaker 1>package.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They spend a lot of time saying how this</v>

29
00:01:29.951 --> 00:01:31.360
<v Speaker 1>didn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how it failed,</v>

30
00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:32.373
<v Speaker 1>and they're repetitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Persistence in this matter has worked </v>

31
00:01:34.181 --> 00:01:36.640
<v Speaker 1>out pretty well for them considering </v>
<v Speaker 1>that this huge,</v>

32
00:01:36.641 --> 00:01:37.474
<v Speaker 1>some would say signature piece of </v>
<v Speaker 1>legislation from the Obama </v>

33
00:01:39.101 --> 00:01:43.300
<v Speaker 1>administration is barely ever talked </v>
<v Speaker 1>about by the administration itself,</v>

34
00:01:43.301 --> 00:01:44.134
<v Speaker 1>but as the exchange showed spelled </v>
<v Speaker 1>poindexters own requests for stimulus </v>

35
00:01:47.291 --> 00:01:48.124
<v Speaker 1>funds for his state seems to contradict </v>
<v Speaker 1>his party's assertion that the stimulus </v>

36
00:01:51.281 --> 00:01:53.200
<v Speaker 1>did nothing for small businesses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

37
00:01:53.201 --> 00:01:54.034
<v Speaker 1>the stimulus achieved a whole host of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things including getting a two drowning </v>

38
00:01:56.951 --> 00:01:57.784
<v Speaker 1>states tax cuts for middle income </v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans grants for schools based on </v>

39
00:02:00.611 --> 00:02:02.840
<v Speaker 1>performance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It paved the way for a smart grid.</v>

40
00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.530
<v Speaker 1>It accelerated the process of digitizing</v>
<v Speaker 1>health records.</v>

41
00:02:05.531 --> 00:02:06.364
<v Speaker 1>It's spent money on homelessness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Prevention on infrastructure upgraded </v>

42
00:02:08.861 --> 00:02:12.430
<v Speaker 1>236 miles of flood control levees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>350 military base,</v>

43
00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.290
<v Speaker 1>850 wastewater systems and 400,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>public housing apartments.</v>

44
00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.153
<v Speaker 1>It helped bring broadband internet too </v>
<v Speaker 1>far out communities and it invested in </v>

45
00:02:21.521 --> 00:02:23.650
<v Speaker 1>future technologies and fledgling </v>
<v Speaker 1>industries.</v>

46
00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:24.693
<v Speaker 1>An example of both is green energy now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This in particular has Paul Ryan in a </v>

47
00:02:28.961 --> 00:02:29.794
<v Speaker 1>tizzy $90,000,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>in green pork to campaign contributors </v>

48
00:02:32.921 --> 00:02:36.850
<v Speaker 1>and special interest groups like he </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself urge Labor Secretary Hilda Solis</v>

49
00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.940
<v Speaker 1>to fund a green jobs training program in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wisconsin.</v>

50
00:02:39.941 --> 00:02:40.774
<v Speaker 1>Green energy is a special favorite of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mine when it comes to the recovery act </v>

51
00:02:43.121 --> 00:02:45.340
<v Speaker 1>because at the end of the Bush </v>
<v Speaker 1>administration,</v>

52
00:02:45.341 --> 00:02:47.830
<v Speaker 1>that sector was on the edge about to </v>
<v Speaker 1>die.</v>

53
00:02:47.831 --> 00:02:49.540
<v Speaker 1>Solar companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wind companies,</v>

54
00:02:49.541 --> 00:02:50.374
<v Speaker 1>biofuel companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're ready to move their businesses to </v>

55
00:02:51.881 --> 00:02:55.270
<v Speaker 1>other places in the world because in </v>
<v Speaker 1>America the money just wasn't there.</v>

56
00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.340
<v Speaker 1>In just the decade before Obama took </v>
<v Speaker 1>office,</v>

57
00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.520
<v Speaker 1>our share in global solar production and</v>
<v Speaker 1>deployment fell from 40 percent to eight</v>

58
00:03:03.161 --> 00:03:03.994
<v Speaker 1>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The recovery acts investment in Green </v>

59
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.633
<v Speaker 1>Tech is a great example of how a </v>
<v Speaker 1>government should seek to affect change </v>

60
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.070
<v Speaker 1>without the billions of dollars in </v>
<v Speaker 1>grants from the stimulus.</v>

61
00:03:12.071 --> 00:03:15.910
<v Speaker 1>Green energy companies were dead in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>water compared to dirty energy.</v>

62
00:03:15.911 --> 00:03:16.744
<v Speaker 1>Companies whose costs from huge scale </v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed them to produce at a much </v>

63
00:03:19.721 --> 00:03:23.440
<v Speaker 1>cheaper and more competitive rate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to mention the billions in subsidies</v>

64
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.440
<v Speaker 1>dirty was and is getting from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government already.</v>

65
00:03:26.441 --> 00:03:29.560
<v Speaker 1>Green Tech needed help to bridge what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>called the valley of death.</v>

66
00:03:29.561 --> 00:03:32.710
<v Speaker 1>That period of time for startups when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they acquire lots of debt,</v>

67
00:03:32.711 --> 00:03:33.544
<v Speaker 1>building their product and achieving the</v>
<v Speaker 1>economies of scale necessary to make </v>

68
00:03:36.701 --> 00:03:39.610
<v Speaker 1>that business profitable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Green Tech was dying because each of its</v>

69
00:03:39.611 --> 00:03:40.444
<v Speaker 1>various technologies was too young or </v>
<v Speaker 1>too risky for private investors who </v>

70
00:03:45.251 --> 00:03:46.930
<v Speaker 1>could make easier money on other things.</v>

71
00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.650
<v Speaker 1>Some will tell you that government </v>
<v Speaker 1>investment like the $90,000,000,000,</v>

72
00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:51.573
<v Speaker 1>that green tech guide in the stimulus </v>
<v Speaker 1>package is bad because it crowds out </v>

73
00:03:54.731 --> 00:03:55.564
<v Speaker 1>private investment in 2009 at the height</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the recession when capital money was </v>

74
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.250
<v Speaker 1>nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The crowding out argument doesn't really</v>

75
00:04:03.251 --> 00:04:04.084
<v Speaker 1>hold water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The recovery act actually crowded in </v>

76
00:04:06.161 --> 00:04:08.240
<v Speaker 1>private investment by helping new </v>
<v Speaker 1>technologies,</v>

77
00:04:08.241 --> 00:04:08.921
<v Speaker 1>solar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wind,</v>

78
00:04:08.921 --> 00:04:10.780
<v Speaker 1>battery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>biofuel bridge,</v>

79
00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.140
<v Speaker 1>the valley of death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making the opportunity sexier.</v>

80
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:15.003
<v Speaker 1>Solar was dying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's one of the fastest growing </v>

81
00:04:17.771 --> 00:04:18.604
<v Speaker 1>industries in the country and if we just</v>
<v Speaker 1>take a look at Romney's old five point </v>

82
00:04:22.481 --> 00:04:23.330
<v Speaker 1>plan here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll see.</v>

83
00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:25.443
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Second we'll give our fellow citizens </v>

84
00:04:27.071 --> 00:04:30.300
<v Speaker 1>the skills they need for the jobs of </v>
<v Speaker 1>today and the careers are tomorrow.</v>

85
00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:31.173
<v Speaker 1>Jobs of tomorrow check.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you wanna learn more about the </v>

86
00:04:37.751 --> 00:04:39.250
<v Speaker 1>recovery act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I highly,</v>

87
00:04:39.251 --> 00:04:40.084
<v Speaker 1>highly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>highly recommend you read Michael </v>

88
00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.440
<v Speaker 1>Grunwald new book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the new new deal.</v>

89
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.560
<v Speaker 1>It should be required reading for anyone</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is going to vote next month.</v>

90
00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.210
<v Speaker 1>It's got pictures in it to look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

91
00:04:52.211 --> 00:04:53.044
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Joe Biden and President Obama were </v>

92
00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.410
<v Speaker 1>just hanging out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hanging out.</v>

93
00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:57.423
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>
