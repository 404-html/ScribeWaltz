<v Speaker 1>think you guys would love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called Nick Pucek.</v>

<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

25
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.080
<v Speaker 1>in the summer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just just subscribed to them.</v>

26
00:01:10.081 --> 00:01:12.960
<v Speaker 1>It'll make them happy sports.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what I got to say about that.</v>

27
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.853
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>love</v>

28
00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.230
<v Speaker 1>is your favorite book you've read in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>past year.</v>

29
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.690
<v Speaker 1>The fault in our stars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any advice for someone who is,</v>

30
00:01:23.691 --> 00:01:26.200
<v Speaker 1>for lack of a better term,</v>
<v Speaker 1>still searching for what they love.</v>

31
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.120
<v Speaker 3>I think that if people have a passion </v>
<v Speaker 3>for something that may not,</v>

32
00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:32.493
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>writing that's not going to pay the </v>

33
00:01:34.301 --> 00:01:35.410
<v Speaker 3>bills,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they just,</v>

34
00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:36.303
<v Speaker 3>they don't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might not pay the bills that might </v>

35
00:01:37.811 --> 00:01:39.850
<v Speaker 3>not pay the bills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't do it.</v>

36
00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.240
<v Speaker 3>And then they just go for the job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's gonna pay the bills.</v>

37
00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:44.530
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

38
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.893
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a lot of hobbies that </v>

39
00:01:46.351 --> 00:01:50.070
<v Speaker 1>you get that you think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you just sort of enjoy.</v>

40
00:01:50.071 --> 00:01:50.904
<v Speaker 1>You think you could never turn it into a</v>
<v Speaker 1>career just because of the way that you </v>

41
00:01:53.041 --> 00:01:57.300
<v Speaker 1>were raised with the way that you think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything that you do that you love can</v>

42
00:01:57.301 --> 00:02:00.420
<v Speaker 1>be turned into a career if you do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>creatively.</v>

43
00:02:00.421 --> 00:02:05.010
<v Speaker 1>Enough of the ancient Greek philosophers</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was the most awesome and why Plato,</v>

44
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.903
<v Speaker 1>because he was the best writer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How is your brain the way your mind </v>

45
00:02:08.281 --> 00:02:11.730
<v Speaker 1>works and your worldview different now </v>
<v Speaker 1>than when you were 18?</v>

46
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:14.783
<v Speaker 1>Because now you're 24.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the big difference between the </v>

47
00:02:18.901 --> 00:02:22.260
<v Speaker 1>difference I think is that now I am </v>
<v Speaker 1>willing to be wrong,</v>

48
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.050
<v Speaker 1>to make someone happy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas when I was 18,</v>

49
00:02:25.051 --> 00:02:28.410
<v Speaker 1>I was obsessed with being right and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>

50
00:02:28.411 --> 00:02:29.244
<v Speaker 1>So true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now I think the best thing that you </v>

51
00:02:32.281 --> 00:02:33.114
<v Speaker 1>can do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are.</v>

52
00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.093
<v Speaker 1>You always had to be right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The best thing that you can do and </v>

53
00:02:36.391 --> 00:02:37.224
<v Speaker 1>learn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hardest thing to learn is that </v>

54
00:02:38.071 --> 00:02:42.360
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it's right to be wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it makes the other person happy.</v>

55
00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.690
<v Speaker 1>Were you afraid of moving out on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>own and was it an easy adjustment?</v>

56
00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.370
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

57
00:02:47.371 --> 00:02:50.480
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to move out so bad when I came </v>
<v Speaker 1>to college.</v>

58
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:51.810
<v Speaker 1>Portland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oregon.</v>

59
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.480
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after college I went to Portland.</v>

60
00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.113
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just didn't want to live at home </v>

61
00:02:55.321 --> 00:02:56.154
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tell that to people and my </v>

62
00:02:57.061 --> 00:03:00.790
<v Speaker 1>relationship with my parents has become </v>
<v Speaker 1>exponentially better since I moved out.</v>

63
00:03:00.791 --> 00:03:03.190
<v Speaker 1>So by the coop man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get out.</v>

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.830
<v Speaker 1>we talk about this earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you're saying.</v>

120
00:05:26.831 --> 00:05:27.664
<v Speaker 1>If you're asking me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do I believe that love is true and real </v>

121
00:05:28.931 --> 00:05:30.280
<v Speaker 1>then yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're asking,</v>

122
00:05:30.281 --> 00:05:32.320
<v Speaker 1>do I believe in soulmates for for all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>us?</v>

123
00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:33.640
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

124
00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not a soul mates.</v>

125
00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.660
<v Speaker 1>You don't take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mom and dad are soulmates.</v>

126
00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.480
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this idea that there's like this</v>

127
00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:41.373
<v Speaker 1>other puzzle piece,</v>
<v Speaker 1>soul out there for you to meet that's </v>

128
00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:48.040
<v Speaker 1>searching through the world is insane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>insane idea.</v>

129
00:05:48.041 --> 00:05:50.380
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that how to come.</v>

130
00:05:50.381 --> 00:05:52.840
<v Speaker 1>They also many of met each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so many people in the world.</v>

131
00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:55.480
<v Speaker 1>They put God really put the puzzle </v>
<v Speaker 1>pieces close together.</v>

132
00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:56.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Advice for college,</v>

133
00:05:56.681 --> 00:05:59.480
<v Speaker 1>freshmen and aspiring writers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

134
00:05:59.481 --> 00:06:04.010
<v Speaker 1>Here's my advice for aspiring writers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Learn how to deal with hating yourself.</v>

135
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:05.770
<v Speaker 1>Writing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's great advice.</v>

136
00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:10.550
<v Speaker 1>Writing in the first weeks and months is</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be a lot of hating yourself.</v>

137
00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.740
<v Speaker 1>Probably six out of the seven days that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you write.</v>

138
00:06:12.741 --> 00:06:14.510
<v Speaker 1>If you write all week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll hate yourself.</v>

139
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:15.673
<v Speaker 1>That number will slowly shrink over time</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what you can do is really look </v>

140
00:06:20.241 --> 00:06:22.310
<v Speaker 1>forward to the days when you think your </v>
<v Speaker 1>writing is good,</v>

141
00:06:22.311 --> 00:06:23.144
<v Speaker 1>but you're always going to have those </v>
<v Speaker 1>days when you think your writing is </v>

142
00:06:24.231 --> 00:06:29.000
<v Speaker 1>terrible and a lot of what stops writers</v>
<v Speaker 1>once they start is not being able to get</v>

143
00:06:29.001 --> 00:06:30.980
<v Speaker 1>through those periods of days when what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

144
00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.350
<v Speaker 1>what you think you write is really shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it is really shit.</v>

145
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:35.120
<v Speaker 1>In the beginning you should get a second</v>
<v Speaker 1>opinion.</v>

146
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:37.460
<v Speaker 1>What did you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your writing is really good,</v>

147
00:06:37.461 --> 00:06:40.130
<v Speaker 1>but it's really not that good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always get a second opinion.</v>

148
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:45.430
<v Speaker 1>Would you rather fight one horse sized </v>
<v Speaker 1>duck or 100 duck sized horses?</v>

149
00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:47.780
<v Speaker 1>I think the answer is obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One weight,</v>

150
00:06:47.781 --> 00:06:52.781
<v Speaker 1>one horse sized duck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or 100 duck sized horses.</v>

151
00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:55.100
<v Speaker 1>100 ducks side is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's no.</v>

152
00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:56.063
<v Speaker 1>There's no argument about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's 100 duck sized horses because you </v>

153
00:06:59.181 --> 00:07:00.320
<v Speaker 1>just mow them down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

154
00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:01.223
<v Speaker 1>Because you say you take a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you take a golf club and was just </v>

155
00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:05.780
<v Speaker 1>fucking mow them down.</v>

156
00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:06.903
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

157
00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:09.963
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will be terrifying to face the duct </v>

158
00:07:12.141 --> 00:07:15.230
<v Speaker 1>size horse or no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be terrifying to face a horse sized</v>

159
00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:16.430
<v Speaker 1>stuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about this.</v>

160
00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:20.390
<v Speaker 1>A horse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A horse sized.</v>

161
00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:21.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

162
00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:22.883
<v Speaker 1>that's what it's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the bravest thing you've ever </v>

163
00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:27.350
<v Speaker 1>done?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bravest thing I ever did was tell my</v>

164
00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:30.770
<v Speaker 1>friends that I love them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you have to make everything sound</v>

165
00:07:30.771 --> 00:07:31.604
<v Speaker 1>dramatic?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there was always some deeper </v>

166
00:07:32.391 --> 00:07:37.391
<v Speaker 1>meaning to it when there is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So actually the bid,</v>

167
00:07:38.161 --> 00:07:41.520
<v Speaker 1>they were staying in these me to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks so much for the [inaudible],</v>

<v Speaker 1>the future,</v>

<v Speaker 6>I can unicycle.</v>

173
00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:01.463
<v Speaker 6>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that person just wanted to tell </v>

174
00:08:01.941 --> 00:08:03.600
<v Speaker 6>me that they could do the cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

175
00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:08.100
<v Speaker 6>they said I can't use the cycle.</v>
