1
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:04.920
<v Speaker 1>Coffee at 4:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>AM on a Saturday night and blog 28,</v>

2
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.440
<v Speaker 1>and so tonight we are on the set of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>very good friend,</v>

3
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:19.283
<v Speaker 1>Nolan as new short film Motel Blues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tonight we're filming at the pear </v>

4
00:00:22.521 --> 00:00:23.354
<v Speaker 1>blossom motel up about 60 miles north of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Los Angeles and we have the whole motel </v>

5
00:00:28.191 --> 00:00:29.024
<v Speaker 1>rented out for the night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which by the way is one of the coolest </v>

6
00:00:30.741 --> 00:00:34.070
<v Speaker 1>things about independent filmmaking and </v>
<v Speaker 1>filmmaking in general is that you get to</v>

7
00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.730
<v Speaker 1>use real locations like this and </v>
<v Speaker 1>repurpose them for your movie.</v>

8
00:00:37.731 --> 00:00:40.940
<v Speaker 1>Tonight I want to show you what goes </v>
<v Speaker 1>into making a short film of this stature</v>

9
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.893
<v Speaker 1>and one thing you should understand is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the only difference between this </v>

10
00:00:43.731 --> 00:00:44.564
<v Speaker 1>and a movie you might see at your local </v>
<v Speaker 1>AMC is the amount of money in the </v>

11
00:00:47.331 --> 00:00:48.164
<v Speaker 1>budget.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way this film is being made is the </v>

12
00:00:48.951 --> 00:00:51.310
<v Speaker 1>way all films are made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A big budget blow.</v>

13
00:00:51.311 --> 00:00:52.130
<v Speaker 1>It might have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

14
00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.160
<v Speaker 1>more people on the crew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more freedom with time and locations and</v>

15
00:00:55.161 --> 00:00:55.994
<v Speaker 1>equipment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all the necessary stuff is here and </v>

16
00:00:57.891 --> 00:01:01.490
<v Speaker 1>it's left like all films to the actors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The story,</v>

17
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.340
<v Speaker 1>the filming techniques and the vision of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the director,</v>

18
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.810
<v Speaker 1>but let me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me introduce you to the quick.</v>

19
00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:07.693
<v Speaker 1>Let's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's.</v>

20
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.993
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so first we had the unit production </v>

21
00:01:30.591 --> 00:01:31.424
<v Speaker 1>manager or ups whose job it is to manage</v>
<v Speaker 1>the production from before the filming </v>

22
00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:36.253
<v Speaker 1>to after upm will create a working </v>
<v Speaker 1>budget before principal photography and </v>

23
00:01:39.531 --> 00:01:42.500
<v Speaker 1>do her level best to make sure that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>final cost,</v>

24
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.960
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't go too much over the mark on </v>
<v Speaker 1>smaller productions.</v>

25
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.610
<v Speaker 1>The UPM is also responsible for hiring a</v>
<v Speaker 1>casting agent as well as anyone else the</v>

26
00:01:49.611 --> 00:01:50.630
<v Speaker 1>crew might need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In short,</v>

27
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:55.430
<v Speaker 1>this person's sails the ship as calmly </v>
<v Speaker 1>as she can to ward principle photography</v>

28
00:01:55.431 --> 00:01:56.264
<v Speaker 1>when the assistant director or add </v>
<v Speaker 1>assumes the job as onset organizer 80 </v>

29
00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.053
<v Speaker 1>maintains order on the set as hooligans </v>
<v Speaker 1>from every department and run this way </v>

30
00:02:04.671 --> 00:02:05.504
<v Speaker 1>and that to arrange the shot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 80 rights and sends out call sheets </v>

31
00:02:08.151 --> 00:02:08.984
<v Speaker 1>which are scheduled for the days of </v>
<v Speaker 1>shooting and the 80 calls out </v>

32
00:02:11.331 --> 00:02:13.630
<v Speaker 1>necessarily commands before the shot </v>
<v Speaker 1>starts.</v>

33
00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.630
<v Speaker 1>It sounds sort of like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roll audio roll camera.</v>

34
00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.070
<v Speaker 1>Next we have the sound record is quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly the most overlooked,</v>

35
00:02:25.071 --> 00:02:27.920
<v Speaker 1>underrated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and important job on an indie film set.</v>

36
00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:28.783
<v Speaker 1>It's difficult to communicate just how </v>
<v Speaker 1>much sound determines the way we </v>

37
00:02:32.001 --> 00:02:32.834
<v Speaker 1>perceive a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Filmmaking gets branded as largely a </v>

38
00:02:35.001 --> 00:02:36.740
<v Speaker 1>visual medium,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but poorly recorded.</v>

39
00:02:36.741 --> 00:02:40.580
<v Speaker 1>Sam can destroy an otherwise great </v>
<v Speaker 1>project to record good sound,</v>

40
00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:41.593
<v Speaker 1>good dialogue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means recording all the many </v>

41
00:02:42.801 --> 00:02:46.430
<v Speaker 1>frequencies of the human voice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The record is used as a boom or lavalier</v>

42
00:02:46.431 --> 00:02:49.730
<v Speaker 1>mic to get as close to the actors' </v>
<v Speaker 1>mouths as possible.</v>

43
00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.310
<v Speaker 1>This requires coordination with the DP </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the director,</v>

44
00:02:52.311 --> 00:02:53.144
<v Speaker 1>making sure that they set up the shot so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the recorders can position his mic </v>

45
00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:57.700
<v Speaker 1>close,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at a frank.</v>

46
00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.000
<v Speaker 1>Next we have the and his assistant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The best board.</v>

47
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.073
<v Speaker 1>These gentlemen are responsible for </v>
<v Speaker 1>lighting a movie and as a film is </v>

48
00:03:04.781 --> 00:03:07.360
<v Speaker 1>essentially a combination of light and </v>
<v Speaker 1>darkness.</v>

49
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.313
<v Speaker 1>They're responsibility is huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Film lighting is exceedingly tricky </v>

50
00:03:11.411 --> 00:03:12.244
<v Speaker 1>because the camera lens sees differently</v>
<v Speaker 1>than the I and the gaffer must </v>

51
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.220
<v Speaker 1>understand that often irrational </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship between the two.</v>

52
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:19.323
<v Speaker 1>When you have a talented one like our </v>
<v Speaker 1>friend Justin here who can work quickly </v>

53
00:03:21.641 --> 00:03:22.474
<v Speaker 1>to produce stunning images,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you simply put up with his embarrassing </v>

54
00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.980
<v Speaker 1>personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Colby,</v>

55
00:03:26.981 --> 00:03:29.620
<v Speaker 1>Jack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Next we have hair and makeup and the art</v>

56
00:03:29.621 --> 00:03:30.454
<v Speaker 1>director.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hair and makeup is responsible for </v>

57
00:03:31.391 --> 00:03:32.224
<v Speaker 1>making the accurus look good and the art</v>
<v Speaker 1>director has that same responsibility </v>

58
00:03:34.871 --> 00:03:35.704
<v Speaker 1>for the set.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Art director can take an otherwise </v>

59
00:03:37.331 --> 00:03:40.090
<v Speaker 1>blend space and create the appropriate </v>
<v Speaker 1>mood with furniture,</v>

60
00:03:40.091 --> 00:03:41.440
<v Speaker 1>trinkets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever he can find.</v>

61
00:03:41.441 --> 00:03:42.274
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing and art director likes </v>
<v Speaker 1>more than a thrift store full of other </v>

62
00:03:44.981 --> 00:03:45.814
<v Speaker 1>people's throwaway junk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Next we have the assistant camera </v>

63
00:03:47.981 --> 00:03:48.814
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those quiet warriors who serve as the </v>

64
00:03:50.351 --> 00:03:51.041
<v Speaker 1>third,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fourth,</v>

65
00:03:51.041 --> 00:03:52.030
<v Speaker 1>fifth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sixth,</v>

66
00:03:52.031 --> 00:03:53.080
<v Speaker 1>the hands of the DP.</v>

67
00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.060
<v Speaker 1>The Camera Department must assemble the </v>
<v Speaker 1>camera,</v>

68
00:03:55.061 --> 00:03:55.894
<v Speaker 1>attach it to whatever tripod or rig will</v>
<v Speaker 1>be used for the shot and question and </v>

69
00:03:58.691 --> 00:04:01.630
<v Speaker 1>perform that daunting and also under </v>
<v Speaker 1>appreciated task.</v>

70
00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.210
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as focus pulling,</v>

71
00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:04.443
<v Speaker 1>see a camera lens can only focus on one </v>
<v Speaker 1>cross section of space away from the </v>

72
00:04:07.961 --> 00:04:10.180
<v Speaker 1>camera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It being a larger small cross section,</v>

73
00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.870
<v Speaker 1>depending on the lens and the light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if either the actors where the camera is</v>

74
00:04:13.871 --> 00:04:14.704
<v Speaker 1>moving during the shot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the noble focus puller must buy soft </v>

75
00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:18.543
<v Speaker 1>adjustments of the Lens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make sure the talent stays within the </v>

76
00:04:21.221 --> 00:04:24.430
<v Speaker 1>given cross section or depth of field.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a game.</v>

77
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.090
<v Speaker 1>The most infuriating game ever created,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the work done by the gaffer.</v>

78
00:04:28.091 --> 00:04:28.924
<v Speaker 1>His assistant and the camera department </v>
<v Speaker 1>is done to satisfy the demands of the </v>

79
00:04:31.781 --> 00:04:32.614
<v Speaker 1>director of photography or DP,</v>
<v Speaker 1>working closely with the director and </v>

80
00:04:35.051 --> 00:04:37.900
<v Speaker 1>being his first partner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The DP determines the shot,</v>

81
00:04:37.901 --> 00:04:39.610
<v Speaker 1>how it will be lit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the camera will move,</v>

82
00:04:39.611 --> 00:04:40.444
<v Speaker 1>what the framing will be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all in an effort to serve the needs of </v>

83
00:04:42.971 --> 00:04:43.690
<v Speaker 1>the story.</v>

84
00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:48.100
<v Speaker 1>Everything a camera does is felt by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience and the DEP must understand and</v>

85
00:04:48.101 --> 00:04:52.540
<v Speaker 1>manipulate the rules of composition that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we might feel what the story wants us to</v>

86
00:04:52.541 --> 00:04:53.374
<v Speaker 1>feel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The DP directs our attention to what we </v>

87
00:04:55.061 --> 00:04:55.894
<v Speaker 1>need to see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other job of the DP always make the </v>

88
00:04:58.121 --> 00:05:00.070
<v Speaker 1>actors look good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The of supply,</v>

89
00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.923
<v Speaker 1>the human element to it felt they take </v>
<v Speaker 1>written characters and make them real </v>

90
00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.100
<v Speaker 1>for the audience to love or hate </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the story demands.</v>

91
00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.113
<v Speaker 1>They are subservient to the director,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but often is the case that actors being </v>

92
00:05:09.671 --> 00:05:10.504
<v Speaker 1>students of human behavior find a way to</v>
<v Speaker 1>present their characters which the </v>

93
00:05:12.881 --> 00:05:16.360
<v Speaker 1>director would never have thought of in </v>
<v Speaker 1>which in fact serve his ends better.</v>

94
00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:17.283
<v Speaker 1>It's important therefore to give actors </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom to find what's real in the </v>

95
00:05:20.231 --> 00:05:22.150
<v Speaker 1>dialogue and action written for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After all,</v>

96
00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:23.860
<v Speaker 1>the audience will never see the script.</v>

97
00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.380
<v Speaker 1>They will see the actors and nine times </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of 10,</v>

98
00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:27.363
<v Speaker 1>the performances are what they'll be </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about on the car ride home and </v>

99
00:05:30.191 --> 00:05:32.980
<v Speaker 1>finally we get to the most important </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of a film.</v>

100
00:05:32.981 --> 00:05:35.650
<v Speaker 1>The part on which everything else </v>
<v Speaker 1>hinges.</v>

101
00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.750
<v Speaker 1>Craft services,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

102
00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:38.643
<v Speaker 1>Where the food is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's perhaps impossible to say what a </v>

103
00:05:40.331 --> 00:05:43.300
<v Speaker 1>film shoot can become if the crew is not</v>
<v Speaker 1>satiated.</v>

104
00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.193
<v Speaker 1>It starts with whispers of maltreatment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wines and backtalk sharp attitudes and </v>

105
00:05:48.251 --> 00:05:49.270
<v Speaker 1>chatting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before you know it,</v>

106
00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.380
<v Speaker 1>someone is throwing a one k at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>director's head for goodness sakes.</v>

107
00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.440
<v Speaker 1>Feed your crew if it's possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spoil them.</v>

108
00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.480
<v Speaker 1>The respect and quality work you'll get </v>
<v Speaker 1>in return will be worth it.</v>

109
00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:01.670
<v Speaker 1>And lastly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the director there will fill,</v>

110
00:06:01.671 --> 00:06:02.504
<v Speaker 1>might sometimes start it's journey to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the theater at the pen of a </v>

111
00:06:04.911 --> 00:06:05.744
<v Speaker 1>screenwriter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and though in unhappy circumstances it </v>

112
00:06:07.521 --> 00:06:10.010
<v Speaker 1>may end its journey with the discretion </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a producer.</v>

113
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.200
<v Speaker 1>There was no question that the artist of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a film,</v>

114
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:16.670
<v Speaker 1>the one whose vision the rest are trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to realize is the director in its purest</v>

115
00:06:16.671 --> 00:06:17.504
<v Speaker 1>form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A director plays all the parts I just </v>

116
00:06:19.221 --> 00:06:20.054
<v Speaker 1>mentioned that of writer director and </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump card holder in large budget </v>

117
00:06:23.211 --> 00:06:24.044
<v Speaker 1>pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is rarely the case and there have </v>

118
00:06:25.281 --> 00:06:27.260
<v Speaker 1>been plenty of fine films made in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>

119
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.260
<v Speaker 1>but the characteristic quality of low </v>
<v Speaker 1>budget film,</v>

120
00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:31.153
<v Speaker 1>especially no budget short films,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that necessity requires that the </v>

121
00:06:34.371 --> 00:06:36.260
<v Speaker 1>director does indeed play all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>parts,</v>

122
00:06:36.261 --> 00:06:38.210
<v Speaker 1>including that of the editor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here.</v>

123
00:06:38.211 --> 00:06:39.044
<v Speaker 1>We really get to see what's in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>filmmakers heart and how he translates </v>

124
00:06:42.351 --> 00:06:43.184
<v Speaker 1>it to the screen.</v>

125
00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:51.090
<v Speaker 2>The no escaping slaves like I can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>submerged and God bless America.</v>

126
00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:58.060
