1
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.510
<v Speaker 1>It's the medium is the message and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't matter what we say on TV.</v>

2
00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.130
<v Speaker 1>Why are we all here tonight?</v>

3
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.980
<v Speaker 2>Why am I asking this question?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a huge technology involved in TV</v>

4
00:00:32.981 --> 00:00:33.814
<v Speaker 2>which surrounds you physically handle </v>
<v Speaker 2>the effect of that huge service </v>

5
00:00:39.801 --> 00:00:44.801
<v Speaker 2>environment on you personally is vast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The effect of the program is incidental.</v>

6
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.810
<v Speaker 2>The effect of the program is incidental.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The effect of the program is incidental.</v>

7
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.280
<v Speaker 2>The effect of the program is incidental.</v>

8
00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:04.293
<v Speaker 1>Marshall Mcluhan's famous saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the medium is the message poses </v>

9
00:01:08.351 --> 00:01:11.290
<v Speaker 1>interesting questions for the age of </v>
<v Speaker 1>online video.</v>

10
00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.393
<v Speaker 1>He gets to the basic point in that clip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Forms of media actually reorganize </v>

11
00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:17.763
<v Speaker 1>our consciousness in McLuhan's time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The great shift in media was from print </v>

12
00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.300
<v Speaker 1>to electronic media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>radio and more importantly,</v>

13
00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.253
<v Speaker 1>television,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the printed book was what he </v>

14
00:01:27.731 --> 00:01:28.564
<v Speaker 1>called hot media and intense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One way offloading of high definition </v>

15
00:01:32.201 --> 00:01:35.800
<v Speaker 1>information into your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The TV was cool.</v>

16
00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.680
<v Speaker 1>It was low definition on in a busy </v>
<v Speaker 1>house,</v>

17
00:01:38.681 --> 00:01:42.250
<v Speaker 1>interrupted by commercials playing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the senses.</v>

18
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:43.383
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it demanded your participation to fill </v>

19
00:01:45.641 --> 00:01:46.474
<v Speaker 1>in the gaps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every kind of media from print to radio </v>

20
00:01:49.211 --> 00:01:50.530
<v Speaker 1>to music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to television,</v>

21
00:01:50.531 --> 00:01:51.364
<v Speaker 1>to the internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>creates a kind of invisible environment </v>

22
00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.170
<v Speaker 1>around us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're watching TV,</v>

23
00:01:56.171 --> 00:01:57.004
<v Speaker 1>you may be aware of the particular show </v>
<v Speaker 1>of how funny or engaging it is of how </v>

24
00:02:00.701 --> 00:02:01.534
<v Speaker 1>relatable the characters are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but rarely do we perceive or step back </v>

25
00:02:05.171 --> 00:02:08.770
<v Speaker 1>to understand what it actually means to </v>
<v Speaker 1>watch tv,</v>

26
00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.450
<v Speaker 1>what it means to be in that audio visual</v>
<v Speaker 1>and immersive sensory environment.</v>

27
00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:14.343
<v Speaker 1>It's no surprise that the great triumph </v>
<v Speaker 1>of television is the triumph of </v>

28
00:02:17.741 --> 00:02:18.574
<v Speaker 1>advertising,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what could possibly be more attuned </v>

29
00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:21.693
<v Speaker 1>to the medium of television than </v>
<v Speaker 1>commercials in 30 seconds or a minute </v>

30
00:02:25.361 --> 00:02:26.194
<v Speaker 1>they invite or require participation </v>
<v Speaker 1>triggering each and every one of the </v>

31
00:02:30.551 --> 00:02:31.384
<v Speaker 1>senses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not to say that advertisements </v>

32
00:02:33.131 --> 00:02:36.490
<v Speaker 1>are good for us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just good for TV.</v>

33
00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.460
<v Speaker 1>Just as early television took its cues </v>
<v Speaker 1>from print,</v>

34
00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:40.563
<v Speaker 1>radio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and film before coming into it's own </v>

35
00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.760
<v Speaker 1>online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Video has taken its cues from tv,</v>

36
00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.050
<v Speaker 1>but like TV online video is a wholly new</v>
<v Speaker 1>medium,</v>

37
00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.010
<v Speaker 1>operating in its own environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reshaping our consciousness.</v>

38
00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.083
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean just the way we watch is </v>

39
00:02:57.341 --> 00:02:58.174
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're close up to the screens with the </v>

40
00:03:00.371 --> 00:03:03.430
<v Speaker 1>screens are small,</v>
<v Speaker 1>often the size of a phone,</v>

41
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.490
<v Speaker 1>whereas my hand is rarely on the remote </v>
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>

42
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:07.563
<v Speaker 1>It's nearly always on the mouse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inviting different kinds of agencies </v>

43
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.950
<v Speaker 1>like the ease at which you can scan </v>
<v Speaker 1>through something.</v>

44
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.903
<v Speaker 1>All these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm sure many more that you could </v>

45
00:03:17.621 --> 00:03:22.621
<v Speaker 1>identify have effects on the styles that</v>
<v Speaker 1>become widely viewed and adopted,</v>

46
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.620
<v Speaker 1>but I think the largest ingredient of </v>
<v Speaker 1>online video is the awareness that every</v>

47
00:03:29.021 --> 00:03:33.250
<v Speaker 1>consumer is a potential creator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The appeal of low five,</v>

48
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.113
<v Speaker 1>of making something that anyone could </v>
<v Speaker 1>potentially produce is extremely </v>

49
00:03:37.241 --> 00:03:39.520
<v Speaker 1>important to the culture of online </v>
<v Speaker 1>video.</v>

50
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:40.533
<v Speaker 1>So much so I'm tempted to say that </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's considered flawed and imperfect </v>

51
00:03:44.021 --> 00:03:48.490
<v Speaker 1>videography in the eyes of other media </v>
<v Speaker 1>is actually essential to online.</v>

52
00:03:48.491 --> 00:03:49.324
<v Speaker 1>Video Mcluhan was fond of saying that </v>
<v Speaker 1>radio was more suited to packages to </v>

53
00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:54.363
<v Speaker 1>completed products.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While TV had a preoccupation with </v>

54
00:03:56.951 --> 00:03:59.380
<v Speaker 1>processes to seeing how things were </v>
<v Speaker 1>done,</v>

55
00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.770
<v Speaker 1>and I think this extends even further </v>
<v Speaker 1>with online video.</v>

56
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.000
<v Speaker 1>Just take a look at daily Vlogs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps the form that's most tailored to</v>

57
00:04:07.001 --> 00:04:07.834
<v Speaker 1>the medium of online video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the process of filming your day of how </v>

58
00:04:11.441 --> 00:04:12.274
<v Speaker 1>the camera moves is vital to the concept</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there are certainly a number of </v>

59
00:04:15.791 --> 00:04:19.540
<v Speaker 1>other styles that have been proven to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>highly compatible with online video.</v>

60
00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.330
<v Speaker 1>One that comes to mind is animated </v>
<v Speaker 1>explainer.</v>

61
00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.420
<v Speaker 1>Let's try to make a list of some more in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the comments below.</v>

62
00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:26.283
<v Speaker 1>I don't completely agree with Mcluhan </v>
<v Speaker 1>when he says the effect of the program </v>

63
00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:30.543
<v Speaker 1>is incidental,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do think that great valuable </v>

64
00:04:33.191 --> 00:04:34.024
<v Speaker 1>content for online video has to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>matched with a style that fits the </v>

65
00:04:38.201 --> 00:04:39.220
<v Speaker 1>medium.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

66
00:04:39.221 --> 00:04:40.054
<v Speaker 1>it's still really early in the history </v>
<v Speaker 1>of this medium in 10 or 20 years with a </v>

67
00:04:43.541 --> 00:04:44.374
<v Speaker 1>better perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll be able to look back at all this </v>

68
00:04:46.181 --> 00:04:50.560
<v Speaker 1>work and point to the first true </v>
<v Speaker 1>masterpieces of the medium,</v>

69
00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:51.633
<v Speaker 1>but what's exciting now is that those of</v>
<v Speaker 1>us who are working in online video are </v>

70
00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:56.733
<v Speaker 1>in effect creating the form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're writing the language of this new </v>

71
00:05:01.121 --> 00:05:01.954
<v Speaker 1>medium and for that reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>experimentation and innovation have to </v>

72
00:05:05.351 --> 00:05:09.490
<v Speaker 1>continue to be a top priority and even </v>
<v Speaker 1>for those who just watch,</v>

73
00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.180
<v Speaker 1>it's essential to study this medium as </v>
<v Speaker 1>it grows,</v>

74
00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.073
<v Speaker 1>to be aware of its message and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>unique environment it creates because </v>

75
00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:19.263
<v Speaker 1>all aspects of the media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have an irresistible force when in </v>

76
00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.983
<v Speaker 1>design.</v>

77
00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:26.990
<v Speaker 1>Hey guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some exciting news.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'll be watching that.</v>

82
00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.050
<v Speaker 1>So I do a video a week now so it should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't be too long.</v>

83
00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:46.430
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I basically break even.</v>

<v Speaker 1>this because I want to talk about this a</v>

<v Speaker 1>lot more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So find me down there and see you next </v>
