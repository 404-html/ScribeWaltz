00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.620
<v Speaker 1>The beard is gone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hair was gone.</v>

2
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.260
<v Speaker 1>The coffee on the Tuesday is right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why not?</v>

3
00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:16.860
<v Speaker 1>So maybe you heard this story in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>news.</v>

4
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.570
<v Speaker 2>The UN Population Fund says the world is</v>
<v Speaker 2>about to add.</v>

5
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:22.553
<v Speaker 2>It's 7000000000th person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The UN says the world's population will </v>

6
00:00:25.981 --> 00:00:27.660
<v Speaker 2>reach a milestone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This Monday,</v>

7
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.120
<v Speaker 2>7 billion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pete,</v>

8
00:00:29.121 --> 00:00:32.280
<v Speaker 2>the world's population will hit 7 </v>
<v Speaker 2>billion,</v>

9
00:00:32.281 --> 00:00:34.650
<v Speaker 2>7 billion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>7 billion come Halloween.</v>

10
00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.250
<v Speaker 2>There will be so many of us on earth </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's actually kind of scary.</v>

11
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.050
<v Speaker 1>It appears that the good old human races</v>
<v Speaker 1>now 7 billion strong,</v>

12
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:41.953
<v Speaker 1>that's nine zero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>133 times around the world counted in </v>

13
00:00:44.911 --> 00:00:47.210
<v Speaker 1>step 200 years to count aloud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Starting from one,</v>

14
00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:48.740
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

15
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.460
<v Speaker 1>four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did it.</v>

16
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.473
<v Speaker 1>So most of what I write is science </v>
<v Speaker 1>fiction and the reason I love sciflies </v>

17
00:00:56.151 --> 00:00:56.984
<v Speaker 1>because I believe that talking about our</v>
<v Speaker 1>future is the best way today to talk </v>

18
00:00:58.761 --> 00:00:59.930
<v Speaker 1>about our president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas in the past,</v>

19
00:00:59.931 --> 00:01:01.730
<v Speaker 1>the best way to talk about our person </v>
<v Speaker 1>was talking about our past.</v>

20
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.313
<v Speaker 1>Put it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the rate of technological evolution </v>

21
00:01:04.491 --> 00:01:08.360
<v Speaker 1>being so fast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our actions today directly implicate the</v>

22
00:01:08.361 --> 00:01:10.280
<v Speaker 1>situation tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The president.</v>

23
00:01:10.281 --> 00:01:13.010
<v Speaker 1>So close to our future that it's like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the shingles on the roof of the house.</v>

24
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.880
<v Speaker 1>Years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>

25
00:01:13.881 --> 00:01:14.714
<v Speaker 1>Moments almost overlap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Each science fiction can explore this </v>

26
00:01:17.571 --> 00:01:20.960
<v Speaker 1>intimate relationship anywhere from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>gutter to the very top all the time.</v>

27
00:01:20.961 --> 00:01:23.300
<v Speaker 1>Warning that if the structure isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>sound,</v>

28
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:24.620
<v Speaker 1>the roof will collapse.</v>

29
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.620
<v Speaker 1>When I tell people my right side fire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get the same question again and again.</v>

30
00:01:27.621 --> 00:01:29.450
<v Speaker 1>What happens when there are too many </v>
<v Speaker 1>people?</v>

31
00:01:29.451 --> 00:01:32.180
<v Speaker 1>What happens when the world becomes </v>
<v Speaker 1>overpopulated?</v>

32
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.033
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a good question and one I tried to </v>

33
00:01:33.981 --> 00:01:37.900
<v Speaker 1>address in my first long fiction novella</v>
<v Speaker 1>called big city.</v>

34
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.000
<v Speaker 1>I put the link to that whole book online</v>
<v Speaker 1>for your pleasure.</v>

35
00:01:41.001 --> 00:01:41.834
<v Speaker 1>You can find it in the doodly do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's return to the idea of </v>

36
00:01:44.151 --> 00:01:44.984
<v Speaker 1>population growth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to know anything about this </v>

37
00:01:46.371 --> 00:01:47.204
<v Speaker 1>subject,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to start with Thomas Malthus </v>

38
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:50.503
<v Speaker 1>and his book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>An essay on the principle of population </v>

39
00:01:52.241 --> 00:01:53.074
<v Speaker 1>was mount.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is idea that humans are the only </v>

40
00:01:54.591 --> 00:01:55.424
<v Speaker 1>animal on earth that increases its </v>
<v Speaker 1>population beyond its available </v>

41
00:01:58.101 --> 00:01:59.150
<v Speaker 1>resources.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically,</v>

42
00:01:59.151 --> 00:01:59.984
<v Speaker 1>we grow faster than we create food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That leaves us with a whole hell of a </v>

43
00:02:02.271 --> 00:02:04.700
<v Speaker 1>lot of people who are underfed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>malnourished.</v>

44
00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.340
<v Speaker 1>According to Malthus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>humanity grows exponentially.</v>

45
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:08.203
<v Speaker 1>Nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not even the plague or two world wars </v>

46
00:02:09.171 --> 00:02:11.840
<v Speaker 1>can put so much as a blip in that graph </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the year 1800,</v>

47
00:02:11.841 --> 00:02:15.220
<v Speaker 1>we were 1,000,000,200</v>
<v Speaker 1>years later and we're 7 billion.</v>

48
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.083
<v Speaker 1>Obviously we can't keep growing forever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so eventually we're going to hit an </v>

49
00:02:17.931 --> 00:02:18.764
<v Speaker 1>asymptote and level out what scientists </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a very hard time agreeing on what </v>

50
00:02:21.501 --> 00:02:22.610
<v Speaker 1>that number will be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

51
00:02:22.611 --> 00:02:25.050
<v Speaker 1>it's range from 10 billion to 20 billion</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

52
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.860
<v Speaker 1>What we do now during the agricultural </v>
<v Speaker 1>and industrial revolutions,</v>

53
00:02:27.861 --> 00:02:28.694
<v Speaker 1>the life expectancy of children </v>
<v Speaker 1>increased dramatically between 1730 and </v>

54
00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:32.443
<v Speaker 1>18.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ten percentage of children who died </v>

55
00:02:33.801 --> 00:02:38.801
<v Speaker 1>before the age of five decreased from 74</v>
<v Speaker 1>point five to 31 point eight.</v>

56
00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:39.763
<v Speaker 1>Advances in medicine like compulsory </v>
<v Speaker 1>vaccination had increased the life </v>

57
00:02:41.811 --> 00:02:45.820
<v Speaker 1>expectancy from 38 and 18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>50 to 78 in 2011.</v>

58
00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.150
<v Speaker 1>The population growth rate hated speed </v>
<v Speaker 1>during the 19 sixties baby boom and just</v>

59
00:02:50.151 --> 00:02:50.984
<v Speaker 1>over two percent ridiculously high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people started to freak out like </v>

60
00:02:53.841 --> 00:02:55.460
<v Speaker 1>Paul Albert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you predicted in his 19,</v>

61
00:02:55.461 --> 00:03:00.460
<v Speaker 1>68 book the population bomb that we were</v>
<v Speaker 1>headed for severe worldwide.</v>

62
00:03:00.461 --> 00:03:01.810
<v Speaker 1>Fortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>early was wrong.</v>

63
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.470
<v Speaker 1>Innovation stepped in and saved the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in this case innovation,</v>

64
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.400
<v Speaker 1>his name was Norman Burlap,</v>

65
00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:07.283
<v Speaker 3>more than half the farmers of the world </v>
<v Speaker 3>living the subsistence agriculture </v>

66
00:03:11.851 --> 00:03:14.430
<v Speaker 3>outside of the economies of their own </v>
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>

67
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.510
<v Speaker 3>They have had very little or no money </v>
<v Speaker 3>with which to make purchases of the many</v>

68
00:03:21.811 --> 00:03:23.700
<v Speaker 3>items that you need for a decent life,</v>

69
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:27.430
<v Speaker 1>for is the father of the green </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution initiatives to develop higher</v>

70
00:03:27.431 --> 00:03:30.690
<v Speaker 1>yield crops using synthetic fertilizers </v>
<v Speaker 1>and hybrid ice.</v>

71
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.210
<v Speaker 1>The Nobel Committee estimated that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>1970 by the time he received the prize,</v>

72
00:03:34.211 --> 00:03:35.044
<v Speaker 1>he had saved a billion lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't you just feel like shit in his </v>

73
00:03:37.421 --> 00:03:38.254
<v Speaker 1>acceptance speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said there can be no permanent </v>

74
00:03:39.821 --> 00:03:40.654
<v Speaker 1>progress in the battle against hunger </v>
<v Speaker 1>until the agencies that fight for </v>

75
00:03:43.481 --> 00:03:48.430
<v Speaker 1>increased food production and those that</v>
<v Speaker 1>flight for population control unite in a</v>

76
00:03:48.431 --> 00:03:49.264
<v Speaker 1>common efforts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Through that the growth rate has been </v>

77
00:03:50.321 --> 00:03:51.154
<v Speaker 1>falling ever since the baby boom and </v>
<v Speaker 1>chances already won't reach that rate </v>

78
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.450
<v Speaker 1>ever again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But consider this diagram,</v>

79
00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:56.313
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>birth rates in the developed world </v>

80
00:03:57.071 --> 00:04:02.030
<v Speaker 1>decrease and level out around one point </v>
<v Speaker 1>seven children per woman in Subsaharan,</v>

81
00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:04.750
<v Speaker 1>Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rate remains at five or more,</v>

82
00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:05.643
<v Speaker 1>or take a look at the distribution of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ages in the developed and undeveloped </v>

83
00:04:08.351 --> 00:04:09.184
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at how many children there are in </v>

84
00:04:11.531 --> 00:04:12.364
<v Speaker 1>the letter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Subsaharan Africa is also where we see </v>

85
00:04:13.931 --> 00:04:14.764
<v Speaker 1>the most poverty and malnourished.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clearly there is a connection between </v>

86
00:04:16.991 --> 00:04:17.824
<v Speaker 1>fertility rate and quality of lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It tells us that a large part of the </v>

87
00:04:20.141 --> 00:04:20.974
<v Speaker 1>problem concerning population growth can</v>
<v Speaker 1>be addressed by the empowerment of </v>

88
00:04:23.741 --> 00:04:24.574
<v Speaker 1>women.</v>

89
00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.330
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

90
00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:41.673
<v Speaker 1>That's Joel Cohen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mathematical biologist and author of </v>

91
00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.943
<v Speaker 1>educating all children a global agenda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying that not only is nutrition a </v>

92
00:04:48.161 --> 00:04:50.650
<v Speaker 1>vital part of balancing population </v>
<v Speaker 1>growth in hunger,</v>

93
00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.670
<v Speaker 1>but also the use of contraception and </v>
<v Speaker 1>most importantly education.</v>

94
00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.970
<v Speaker 1>You can find the link to his Amazon page</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the dubliner.</v>

95
00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.873
<v Speaker 1>I want to make one final point on </v>
<v Speaker 1>population growth and I'll have malthus </v>

96
00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:01.300
<v Speaker 1>helped me out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

97
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.133
<v Speaker 1>I believe that it is the intention of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the creator that Earth should be </v>

98
00:05:04.181 --> 00:05:05.014
<v Speaker 1>replenished,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but certainly with a healthy virtuous </v>

99
00:05:07.151 --> 00:05:07.984
<v Speaker 1>and happy population,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not an unhealthy vicious and miserable </v>

100
00:05:10.601 --> 00:05:11.434
<v Speaker 1>one and if and endeavoring to obey the </v>
<v Speaker 1>command to increase and multiply we </v>

101
00:05:14.381 --> 00:05:15.214
<v Speaker 1>people at only with beings of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>latter description and suffer </v>

102
00:05:17.351 --> 00:05:18.184
<v Speaker 1>accordingly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have no right to impeach the justice </v>

103
00:05:20.801 --> 00:05:21.634
<v Speaker 1>of the command,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but only our rational emotive executing </v>

104
00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.630
<v Speaker 1>the justice of the committee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here.</v>

105
00:05:25.631 --> 00:05:29.110
<v Speaker 1>He's talking about God's desire for us </v>
<v Speaker 1>to multiply and grow.</v>

106
00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:30.970
<v Speaker 1>Of course that's fully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no god.</v>

107
00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:34.180
<v Speaker 1>There is no question that as a species </v>
<v Speaker 1>and like every other species on earth,</v>

108
00:05:34.181 --> 00:05:37.450
<v Speaker 1>we had the innate desire to procreate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of it is evolutionary,</v>

109
00:05:37.451 --> 00:05:40.210
<v Speaker 1>but the question must be is all of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolution.</v>

110
00:05:40.211 --> 00:05:41.044
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to have kids because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to ensure the future survival of </v>

111
00:05:43.001 --> 00:05:45.040
<v Speaker 1>the human race?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or do you want them for other reasons?</v>

112
00:05:45.041 --> 00:05:45.874
<v Speaker 1>Social reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's strange not to or personal </v>

113
00:05:47.501 --> 00:05:48.334
<v Speaker 1>reasons because you crave a specific </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of love because you want to be </v>

114
00:05:50.471 --> 00:05:51.304
<v Speaker 1>needed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even secret reason secret to yourself </v>

115
00:05:52.571 --> 00:05:53.404
<v Speaker 1>because you know that you will die and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no escaping it in one way to </v>

116
00:05:56.201 --> 00:06:00.050
<v Speaker 1>ease the pain of is to know that someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>will remember you and tell about you and</v>

117
00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:02.390
<v Speaker 1>in that you achieve a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>immortality.</v>

118
00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:05.900
<v Speaker 1>Humanity can outgrow its evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 1>instructions.</v>

119
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:07.010
<v Speaker 1>By the time you die.</v>

120
00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.873
<v Speaker 1>How many times do you think you'll have </v>
<v Speaker 1>had sex to procreate and how many times </v>

121
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:12.163
<v Speaker 1>just for pleasure?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Advances in medicine will allow us to </v>

122
00:06:13.611 --> 00:06:18.260
<v Speaker 1>live longer just as we jumped from 38 to</v>
<v Speaker 1>78 and 150 years.</v>

123
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:19.123
<v Speaker 1>Advances in technology will not only </v>
<v Speaker 1>allow our world to be energy </v>

124
00:06:21.021 --> 00:06:22.430
<v Speaker 1>independent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but ourselves.</v>

125
00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.980
<v Speaker 1>Imagine getting all this sustenance you </v>
<v Speaker 1>need from the sun.</v>

126
00:06:24.981 --> 00:06:25.814
<v Speaker 1>Imagine living to the age of 200 when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll really be able to count to 7 </v>

127
00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:29.840
<v Speaker 1>billion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it seems out there too,</v>

128
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:33.140
<v Speaker 1>but evolution like population is </v>
<v Speaker 1>exponential and when we can live as long</v>

129
00:06:33.141 --> 00:06:33.974
<v Speaker 1>as we want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what will happen to our desire to </v>

130
00:06:34.911 --> 00:06:36.260
<v Speaker 1>procreate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have children?</v>

131
00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.910
<v Speaker 1>There is no easy way to answer this </v>
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>

132
00:06:37.911 --> 00:06:40.280
<v Speaker 1>but I do my best to try in a second long</v>
<v Speaker 1>fiction,</v>

133
00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:43.700
<v Speaker 1>a novel called all languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rows coming soon.</v>
