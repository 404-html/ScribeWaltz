00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.473
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to believe that 40 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fleetwood Mac released it's masterpiece </v>

2
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:13.183
<v Speaker 1>rumors because the record's still sounds</v>
<v Speaker 1>as beautiful and pristine and new as it </v>

3
00:00:18.201 --> 00:00:19.034
<v Speaker 1>did in 1977.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a timeless album as far as I'm </v>

4
00:00:21.621 --> 00:00:24.020
<v Speaker 1>concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a work of art that lasts,</v>

5
00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:25.550
<v Speaker 1>and that's really the goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it,</v>

6
00:00:25.551 --> 00:00:26.384
<v Speaker 1>for anyone in the creative arts to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that feels alive months and </v>

7
00:00:30.081 --> 00:00:32.000
<v Speaker 1>years and decades after it's.</v>

8
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.910
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what makes</v>

9
00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:39.800
<v Speaker 1>rumors so good?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

10
00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:40.693
<v Speaker 1>there are of course a lot of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The skills of the individual band </v>

11
00:00:42.561 --> 00:00:44.240
<v Speaker 1>members,</v>
<v Speaker 1>songwriting craft,</v>

12
00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.830
<v Speaker 1>the producers and engineers and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>virtually unlimited budget and time that</v>

13
00:00:48.831 --> 00:00:49.664
<v Speaker 1>fleetwood Mac got from warner brothers </v>
<v Speaker 1>following the release of their self </v>

14
00:00:52.701 --> 00:00:55.070
<v Speaker 1>titled Album,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was burning up the radio.</v>

15
00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.173
<v Speaker 1>That money in time means a lot to a band</v>
<v Speaker 1>like fleetwood Mac who like the Beatles </v>

16
00:00:59.781 --> 00:01:00.614
<v Speaker 1>or Kanye west or frank ocean shines </v>
<v Speaker 1>brightest in the studio where they can </v>

17
00:01:04.461 --> 00:01:07.760
<v Speaker 1>exercise minute control over every part </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a song.</v>

18
00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.140
<v Speaker 1>Each track is like a sonic paintings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As Co producer of rumors can.</v>

19
00:01:12.141 --> 00:01:14.870
<v Speaker 1>Calais wants described it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you're wondering what he means by</v>

20
00:01:14.871 --> 00:01:15.704
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just take a listen to the difference </v>

21
00:01:16.581 --> 00:01:20.090
<v Speaker 1>between the demo of Stevie Nicks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Classic Song Dreams,</v>

22
00:01:20.091 --> 00:01:23.330
<v Speaker 1>which you're hearing right now in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>final product.</v>

23
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.720
<v Speaker 1>This is how it worked with fleetwood </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mac.</v>

24
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:46.613
<v Speaker 1>In this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stevie Nicks wrote a beautiful piano </v>

25
00:01:48.571 --> 00:01:51.420
<v Speaker 1>melody and lyrics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the band in particular,</v>

26
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.283
<v Speaker 1>Lindsey Buckingham,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spent the better part of a year adding </v>

27
00:01:54.751 --> 00:01:58.890
<v Speaker 1>and experimenting to create a rich,</v>
<v Speaker 1>full bodied sonic experience.</v>

28
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.113
<v Speaker 1>At its core,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dreams is a pretty simple song that </v>

29
00:02:01.711 --> 00:02:06.711
<v Speaker 1>consists of only two quarts played over </v>
<v Speaker 1>and over and over again.</v>

30
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:08.063
<v Speaker 1>Next,</v>
<v Speaker 1>presented the song to the band on a </v>

31
00:02:08.881 --> 00:02:09.714
<v Speaker 1>fender Rhodes piano.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Buckingham added an acoustic guitar and </v>

32
00:02:12.751 --> 00:02:15.420
<v Speaker 1>Christine mcvie played a Hammond b three</v>
<v Speaker 1>organ.</v>

33
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.260
<v Speaker 1>Then Mick fleetwood added drums and John</v>
<v Speaker 1>mcphee added Bass Guitar,</v>

34
00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.220
<v Speaker 1>a very hypnotic rhythm section.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The base just alternates between F and g</v>

35
00:02:23.221 --> 00:02:24.054
<v Speaker 1>with some variations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the standup part of the drums are </v>

36
00:02:26.491 --> 00:02:31.110
<v Speaker 1>these tapping high hats which run over </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything throughout the whole song.</v>

37
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.600
<v Speaker 1>That's the track fleetwood Mac laid down</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the recording session in Sausalito,</v>

38
00:02:36.601 --> 00:02:39.660
<v Speaker 1>but the song was far from complete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

39
00:02:39.661 --> 00:02:40.494
<v Speaker 1>Buckingham and the producers were </v>
<v Speaker 1>convinced that the drums were hypnotic </v>

40
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.230
<v Speaker 1>enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they created a loop of eight bar loop</v>

41
00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.180
<v Speaker 1>of eight bars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight bars,</v>

42
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.660
<v Speaker 1>easier said than done on analog tape </v>
<v Speaker 1>delay.</v>

43
00:02:51.661 --> 00:02:54.930
<v Speaker 1>Also edit a phaser to the high hat so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they would have a swishy thing,</v>

44
00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.273
<v Speaker 1>stick out later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Buckingham recorded and electric guitar </v>

45
00:02:58.351 --> 00:02:59.184
<v Speaker 1>part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>adding those soupy licks that float </v>

46
00:03:00.791 --> 00:03:01.624
<v Speaker 1>through the verse and then tighten up in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pre chorus and eventually give way </v>

47
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.120
<v Speaker 1>to an acoustic guitar in the course </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

48
00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:20.593
<v Speaker 1>Buildup and release and change across </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sections of a pop song or what make </v>

49
00:03:24.441 --> 00:03:26.450
<v Speaker 1>it compelling to the Listener </v>
<v Speaker 1>Buckingham,</v>

50
00:03:26.451 --> 00:03:29.960
<v Speaker 1>who is a genius at filling in these </v>
<v Speaker 1>kinds of colors and ideas,</v>

51
00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.823
<v Speaker 1>usually spur on more ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Calais describes in his book on rumors </v>

52
00:03:33.771 --> 00:03:35.600
<v Speaker 1>that when Nick's heard the new parts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the song,</v>

53
00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.960
<v Speaker 1>she had her own idea for background </v>
<v Speaker 1>vocals and the pre chorus.</v>

54
00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.090
<v Speaker 1>She worked out the parts with Christine </v>
<v Speaker 1>mcvie.</v>

55
00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.530
<v Speaker 1>They give the sad and dreamlike song and</v>
<v Speaker 1>even more ghostly feel here.</v>

56
00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.393
<v Speaker 1>Take a listen.</v>

57
00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:02.623
<v Speaker 1>The song,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course is about Lindsey Buckingham </v>

58
00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.800
<v Speaker 1>and it literally feels like it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>haunting him.</v>

59
00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:08.053
<v Speaker 1>Stevie Nicks wrote it shortly after </v>
<v Speaker 1>their breakup and as she says in the </v>

60
00:04:10.281 --> 00:04:11.114
<v Speaker 1>lyrics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she couldn't go on because Lindsey </v>

61
00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.650
<v Speaker 1>wanted his freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now in loneliness,</v>

62
00:04:15.651 --> 00:04:19.460
<v Speaker 1>he has to dwell on what he had and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>he lost.</v>

63
00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:23.510
<v Speaker 1>It's a cruel twist of fate that the song</v>
<v Speaker 1>became such a hit that Buckingham had to</v>

64
00:04:23.511 --> 00:04:26.840
<v Speaker 1>spend the next 40 years singing it in </v>
<v Speaker 1>concert.</v>

65
00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:28.220
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at this point,</v>

66
00:04:28.221 --> 00:04:29.990
<v Speaker 1>the song was almost done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nicks,</v>

67
00:04:29.991 --> 00:04:34.660
<v Speaker 1>Buckingham and big V created a tight </v>
<v Speaker 1>three part vocal harmony for the quarter</v>

68
00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.570
<v Speaker 1>and then they brightened up the pre </v>
<v Speaker 1>courses with a vibraphone and the second</v>

69
00:04:43.571 --> 00:04:44.404
<v Speaker 1>chorus with a Conga drum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are both touches that you can </v>

70
00:04:46.601 --> 00:04:49.450
<v Speaker 1>barely hear and certainly don't think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about much when you listen,</v>

71
00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.250
<v Speaker 1>but your brain registers the accents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When Calais mixed the song,</v>

72
00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.000
<v Speaker 1>he was careful to put every instrument </v>
<v Speaker 1>in its right place and have a wide range</v>

73
00:04:58.001 --> 00:05:01.960
<v Speaker 1>of sounds from base to midrange treble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the case of dreams,</v>

74
00:05:01.961 --> 00:05:02.794
<v Speaker 1>Calais pushed many of the instruments </v>
<v Speaker 1>down to give them a little more base so </v>

75
00:05:06.161 --> 00:05:06.994
<v Speaker 1>that the high hat I talked about earlier</v>
<v Speaker 1>with stand out as well as Nick's </v>

76
00:05:10.271 --> 00:05:11.104
<v Speaker 1>incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also in the high end is Buckingham's </v>

77
00:05:19.611 --> 00:05:20.444
<v Speaker 1>whining guitar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a muddled longing response to the sharp </v>

78
00:05:23.211 --> 00:05:28.211
<v Speaker 1>poetry of the lyrics on rumors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fleetwood Mac made perfect pop music.</v>

79
00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.870
<v Speaker 1>It didn't reinvent the wheel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It dip the wheel and liquid gold.</v>

80
00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.090
<v Speaker 1>These are concise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gorgeous songs,</v>

81
00:05:35.091 --> 00:05:40.010
<v Speaker 1>stressed up with multicolored sounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but built on foundations of real emotion</v>

82
00:05:40.011 --> 00:05:40.844
<v Speaker 1>and real heartbreak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's pretty safe to say that 40 </v>

83
00:05:42.831 --> 00:05:43.664
<v Speaker 1>years from now will still be listening </v>
<v Speaker 1>to fleetwood Mac as John Keats once </v>

84
00:05:46.701 --> 00:05:48.980
<v Speaker 1>wrote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A thing of beauty is a joy.</v>

85
00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
