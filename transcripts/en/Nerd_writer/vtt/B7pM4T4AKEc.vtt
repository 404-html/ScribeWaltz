00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.210
<v Speaker 1>Biblically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boop and Gobbledy Goop,</v>

2
00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.940
<v Speaker 1>coffee on a Tuesday and blog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>41.</v>

3
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:17.280
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.870
<v Speaker 1>Reading over last week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sunday Times,</v>

5
00:00:18.871 --> 00:00:21.190
<v Speaker 1>I came across this article by Christie </v>
<v Speaker 1>Wampole,</v>

6
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:22.373
<v Speaker 1>how to live without irony,</v>
<v Speaker 1>airs out certain grievances and </v>

7
00:00:25.231 --> 00:00:29.610
<v Speaker 1>irritation she has about hipsters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The archetype she says of ironic living,</v>

8
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:30.503
<v Speaker 1>the hipster haunts every city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>street and university town manifesting </v>

9
00:00:33.181 --> 00:00:35.310
<v Speaker 1>enough style for times he never lived </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself.</v>

10
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.790
<v Speaker 1>This contemporary urban harlequin </v>
<v Speaker 1>appropriates outmoded fashions,</v>

11
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.320
<v Speaker 1>the mustache,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tidy shorts,</v>

12
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.730
<v Speaker 1>mechanisms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fixed gear,</v>

13
00:00:41.731 --> 00:00:44.100
<v Speaker 1>bicycles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>portable record players and hobbies,</v>

14
00:00:44.101 --> 00:00:44.934
<v Speaker 1>homebrewing playing trombone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He harvests awkwardness and </v>

15
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.590
<v Speaker 1>selfconsciousness before he makes any </v>
<v Speaker 1>choice.</v>

16
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.880
<v Speaker 1>He has proceeded through several stages </v>
<v Speaker 1>of self scrutiny and wouldn't it be nice</v>

17
00:00:53.881 --> 00:00:54.714
<v Speaker 1>if columnists proceeded through those </v>
<v Speaker 1>same several stages of self scrutiny </v>

18
00:00:57.421 --> 00:00:58.254
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She continues to exhibit ironic </v>

19
00:00:59.851 --> 00:01:00.930
<v Speaker 1>tendencies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

20
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.180
<v Speaker 1>I find it difficult to give sincere </v>
<v Speaker 1>gifts.</v>

21
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.280
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I often give what in the past would have</v>

22
00:01:05.281 --> 00:01:07.830
<v Speaker 1>been accepted only at a white elephant </v>
<v Speaker 1>gift exchange,</v>

23
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:08.753
<v Speaker 1>a kitschy painting from a thrift store </v>
<v Speaker 1>or a coffee mug with flashy images of </v>

24
00:01:11.041 --> 00:01:12.330
<v Speaker 1>Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lone star,</v>

25
00:01:12.331 --> 00:01:14.610
<v Speaker 1>state plastic Mexican wrestler figures.</v>

26
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:15.623
<v Speaker 1>The simple act of noticing myself </v>
<v Speaker 1>defensive behavior has made me think </v>

27
00:01:18.571 --> 00:01:21.900
<v Speaker 1>deeply about how potentially toxic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ironic posturing could be.</v>

28
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:22.763
<v Speaker 1>The simple act of noticing myself </v>
<v Speaker 1>defensive behavior has made me think </v>

29
00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:26.184
<v Speaker 1>deeply about how potentially maybe I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>guessing that you guys are bad gift </v>

30
00:01:30.151 --> 00:01:30.811
<v Speaker 1>givers to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

31
00:01:30.811 --> 00:01:31.644
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the crux of this article is that </v>

32
00:01:32.551 --> 00:01:33.384
<v Speaker 1>ironic living exemplified by hipsters is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a defense mechanism that allows us to </v>

33
00:01:36.931 --> 00:01:40.800
<v Speaker 1>evade the vulnerable intensity of naked </v>
<v Speaker 1>personal interaction.</v>

34
00:01:40.801 --> 00:01:41.634
<v Speaker 1>She hangs a lot of this on the digital </v>
<v Speaker 1>toys we carry around with us and a deep </v>

35
00:01:44.701 --> 00:01:48.810
<v Speaker 1>desire for sentimentality and nostalgia </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I must say that nostalgia,</v>

36
00:01:48.811 --> 00:01:53.180
<v Speaker 1>sentimentality and defense mechanisms </v>
<v Speaker 1>are all conditions that I suffer from.</v>

37
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.053
<v Speaker 1>They also happen to be numbers 12,</v>
<v Speaker 1>35 and 63 respectively of the human </v>

38
00:01:57.571 --> 00:01:59.730
<v Speaker 1>condition for a full list of the human </v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions.</v>

39
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.800
<v Speaker 1>You can visit yourself and yet even if I</v>
<v Speaker 1>suffer from these symptoms,</v>

40
00:02:04.801 --> 00:02:05.634
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that you could diagnose me </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the supposedly endemic of ironic </v>

41
00:02:08.581 --> 00:02:08.820
<v Speaker 1>living.</v>

42
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.890
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know anyone.</v>

43
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.350
<v Speaker 1>When you get down to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who you could diagnose with that.</v>

44
00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.213
<v Speaker 1>After I came back from Paris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most frequent question I was asked </v>

45
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.393
<v Speaker 1>was not really a question at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more of a statement with a question </v>

46
00:02:20.101 --> 00:02:21.030
<v Speaker 1>mark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the end of the French,</v>

47
00:02:21.031 --> 00:02:22.480
<v Speaker 1>people don't like Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

48
00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.680
<v Speaker 1>This I found perplexing because for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>six months that I lived there,</v>

49
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.633
<v Speaker 1>not a single French person treated me </v>
<v Speaker 1>poorly for my Americanness and </v>

50
00:02:30.331 --> 00:02:33.330
<v Speaker 1>affliction I am no doubt soaked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

51
00:02:33.331 --> 00:02:34.164
<v Speaker 1>the people I met there were so generous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The relationships so easily formed and </v>

52
00:02:37.201 --> 00:02:38.034
<v Speaker 1>quickly deep that I was doubly perplexed</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the stereotype to these people I </v>

53
00:02:41.101 --> 00:02:42.090
<v Speaker 1>answered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Invariably,</v>

54
00:02:42.091 --> 00:02:44.160
<v Speaker 1>every man is his own man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every woman,</v>

55
00:02:44.161 --> 00:02:48.090
<v Speaker 1>her own woman kind people like to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>treated kindly and French.</v>

56
00:02:48.091 --> 00:02:48.924
<v Speaker 1>People who walk around with sad faces </v>
<v Speaker 1>like to be asked what's wrong in France </v>

57
00:02:52.231 --> 00:02:53.064
<v Speaker 1>and at home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have friends who have typewriters and </v>

58
00:02:54.421 --> 00:02:55.254
<v Speaker 1>fixed gear bicycles who brew their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>beer and cover their walls with stuff </v>

59
00:02:58.201 --> 00:02:59.560
<v Speaker 1>they found on the side of the street.</v>

60
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.410
<v Speaker 1>Some are politically active.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Others not so much.</v>

61
00:03:02.411 --> 00:03:05.620
<v Speaker 1>Some are certain who they are and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to do.</v>

62
00:03:05.621 --> 00:03:08.470
<v Speaker 1>Others not so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they look at their phones when</v>

63
00:03:08.471 --> 00:03:09.304
<v Speaker 1>I talked to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other times they walk around with sad </v>

64
00:03:10.931 --> 00:03:11.764
<v Speaker 1>faces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I asked them what's wrong and they tell </v>

65
00:03:13.871 --> 00:03:15.520
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they ask me.</v>

66
00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:16.383
<v Speaker 1>Finally one Paul writes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what will future generations make of </v>

67
00:03:18.491 --> 00:03:22.090
<v Speaker 1>this ramp and sarcasm and unapologetic </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultivation of silliness.</v>

68
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.073
<v Speaker 1>Will we be satisfied to leave an archive</v>
<v Speaker 1>filled with video clips of people doing </v>

69
00:03:25.931 --> 00:03:27.880
<v Speaker 1>stupid things?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stupid things,</v>

70
00:03:27.881 --> 00:03:31.060
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exhibit a Charlie McDonald's last video.</v>

71
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm scared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exhibit B,</v>

72
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.930
<v Speaker 1>Nine hundred and 21,835</v>
<v Speaker 1>views.</v>

73
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.120
<v Speaker 1>Exhibit C,</v>
<v Speaker 1>40,000.</v>

74
00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.983
<v Speaker 1>Seventy two comments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm proud to be part of an archive of </v>

75
00:03:43.661 --> 00:03:44.494
<v Speaker 1>passionate people saying sincere things </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm convinced that what we do is </v>

76
00:03:49.181 --> 00:03:52.450
<v Speaker 1>contagious and if I may be so bold as to</v>
<v Speaker 1>state a common mission,</v>

77
00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:53.523
<v Speaker 1>it's to circulate with force the notion </v>
<v Speaker 1>that every person is at all times going </v>

78
00:03:58.511 --> 00:03:59.344
<v Speaker 1>through something and that it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>right to judge individuals based on </v>

79
00:04:02.261 --> 00:04:05.680
<v Speaker 1>groups if it is at any time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right to judge individuals.</v>

80
00:04:05.681 --> 00:04:06.940
<v Speaker 1>Period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A simple message,</v>

81
00:04:06.941 --> 00:04:07.774
<v Speaker 1>but a strong one and I was sure that </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding it was part of the </v>

82
00:04:11.531 --> 00:04:14.800
<v Speaker 1>interview process for professors at </v>
<v Speaker 1>Princeton University.</v>

83
00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.150
<v Speaker 1>Don't get me started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really professors</v>

84
00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.620
<v Speaker 3>tell me that the system can be that.</v>
