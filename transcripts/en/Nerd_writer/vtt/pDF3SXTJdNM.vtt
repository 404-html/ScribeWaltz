00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.890
<v Speaker 1>This might be a silly question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what do you do with a beached whale?</v>

2
00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:07.783
<v Speaker 1>That's a question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The small Canadian town of Trout River </v>

3
00:00:10.401 --> 00:00:15.200
<v Speaker 1>is trying to figure out right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an 81 foot beast of a whale washed up on</v>

4
00:00:15.201 --> 00:00:19.010
<v Speaker 1>one of his rocky beaches last week as </v>
<v Speaker 1>food and it's humongous.</v>

5
00:00:19.011 --> 00:00:19.844
<v Speaker 1>Stomach begins to rot and decompose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bacteria proliferates and that bacteria </v>

6
00:00:24.321 --> 00:00:25.154
<v Speaker 1>in turn begins to feed on the whales.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Inerts microbes called anaerobic </v>

7
00:00:29.481 --> 00:00:30.314
<v Speaker 1>mythology and start to break down </v>
<v Speaker 1>molecules and release methane gas into </v>

8
00:00:33.891 --> 00:00:37.490
<v Speaker 1>the sealed environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>billowing that fucker up like a birthday</v>

9
00:00:37.491 --> 00:00:41.690
<v Speaker 1>party balloon wait too long and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whale might explode.</v>

10
00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:44.360
<v Speaker 1>It's a cool concept,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't really want that if you're</v>

11
00:00:44.361 --> 00:00:45.194
<v Speaker 1>trout river bringing and unassuming </v>
<v Speaker 1>gentleman to sort of poke it with a </v>

12
00:00:48.021 --> 00:00:50.270
<v Speaker 1>stick and you're going to get the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>results.</v>

13
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.990
<v Speaker 1>So what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

14
00:00:53.991 --> 00:00:55.940
<v Speaker 1>you really have two options.</v>

15
00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:56.773
<v Speaker 1>You can either airlift the dead whale </v>
<v Speaker 1>back into the ocean so that its carcass </v>

16
00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.820
<v Speaker 1>can feed an entire ecosystem of life for</v>
<v Speaker 1>decades.</v>

17
00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.340
<v Speaker 1>Side note,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Radiolab has an awesome animation of how</v>

18
00:01:07.341 --> 00:01:08.174
<v Speaker 1>this process works and you can find that</v>
<v Speaker 1>link in the description or you can bury </v>

19
00:01:12.081 --> 00:01:12.914
<v Speaker 1>the whale somewhere on land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both options are going to be really </v>

20
00:01:15.891 --> 00:01:19.310
<v Speaker 1>expensive and that's public money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aka tax money,</v>

21
00:01:19.311 --> 00:01:21.890
<v Speaker 1>Aka your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you do nothing,</v>

22
00:01:21.891 --> 00:01:26.190
<v Speaker 1>the methane gas along with the ammonia </v>
<v Speaker 1>and hydrogen sulfide are gonna.</v>

23
00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.500
<v Speaker 1>Get really smelly really fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Side note,</v>

24
00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:30.343
<v Speaker 1>ammonia is the one that smells like cat </v>
<v Speaker 1>piss and hydrogen sulfide is the one </v>

25
00:01:33.231 --> 00:01:37.190
<v Speaker 1>that smells like rotten eggs and is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>part one.</v>

26
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.053
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna have to do something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trout River and and before you say </v>

27
00:01:40.821 --> 00:01:43.820
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I can see the look in your eyes,</v>

28
00:01:43.821 --> 00:01:44.654
<v Speaker 1>don't think about blowing it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we tried that already in in </v>

29
00:01:48.651 --> 00:01:49.940
<v Speaker 1>Portland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oregon in 1970</v>

30
00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.840
<v Speaker 2>that had to be fed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Oregon State Highway Division.</v>

31
00:01:52.841 --> 00:01:55.380
<v Speaker 2>Not all had a whale of a problem on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>tab.</v>

32
00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.093
<v Speaker 1>Those thudding noises that you hear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's thousands of pieces of whale </v>

33
00:02:10.761 --> 00:02:11.594
<v Speaker 1>carcass showering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unsuspecting passers by and what I'm </v>

34
00:02:14.301 --> 00:02:19.301
<v Speaker 1>sure still remains the most traumatic </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience of their lives.</v>

35
00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:20.773
<v Speaker 2>Art Car over a quarter of a mile from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the black fight was the target of one </v>

36
00:02:23.481 --> 00:02:24.314
<v Speaker 2>large chunk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The passenger compartment literally </v>

37
00:02:26.211 --> 00:02:29.360
<v Speaker 2>smack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fortunately no human was hit as badly as</v>

38
00:02:29.361 --> 00:02:30.194
<v Speaker 2>the car over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone on the scene was covered with </v>

39
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.510
<v Speaker 2>small particles of dead.</v>

40
00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.250
<v Speaker 1>It just goes to show you can't blow up </v>
<v Speaker 1>all your problems.</v>

41
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.450
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you have to hunker down and </v>
<v Speaker 1>invent the portal gun.</v>

42
00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:44.810
<v Speaker 1>Are we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are we working on this?</v>

43
00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.690
<v Speaker 1>Fucking him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You may have noticed that sometimes I'll</v>

44
00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:50.683
<v Speaker 1>disappear for a few weeks or months </v>
<v Speaker 1>without any message of where I've gone </v>

45
00:02:53.481 --> 00:02:56.090
<v Speaker 1>and I'm sorry about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know if you're like this,</v>

46
00:02:56.091 --> 00:03:00.130
<v Speaker 1>but I can't seem to stop jumping to </v>
<v Speaker 1>different projects.</v>

47
00:03:00.131 --> 00:03:03.040
<v Speaker 1>Like I did this sketch comedy channel </v>
<v Speaker 1>called Dick Soap,</v>

48
00:03:03.041 --> 00:03:05.890
<v Speaker 1>which you can check out or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>electronic app,</v>

49
00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.550
<v Speaker 1>a new disguises which you listened to on</v>
<v Speaker 1>spotify,</v>

50
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.210
<v Speaker 1>but I'm back for the nerd writer for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit.</v>

51
00:03:13.211 --> 00:03:15.650
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully I'm going to try to separate </v>
<v Speaker 1>it into like season,</v>

52
00:03:15.651 --> 00:03:17.630
<v Speaker 1>so six or 10 episodes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

53
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.570
<v Speaker 1>and hopefully this is the beginning of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>stretch.</v>

54
00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.120
<v Speaker 1>So thanks for sticking with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

55
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.760
<v Speaker 1>and I will see you next time.</v>
