00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.790
<v Speaker 1>Hey everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>welcome back and coffee on a Tuesday and</v>

2
00:00:02.791 --> 00:00:03.624
<v Speaker 1>blog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fifty three.</v>

3
00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:14.900
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.510
<v Speaker 1>Here's the story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the theory in the 15th century,</v>

5
00:00:17.511 --> 00:00:18.344
<v Speaker 1>a dynastic civil war known today as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>war of the roses resulted in the </v>

6
00:00:21.801 --> 00:00:25.550
<v Speaker 1>annihilation of virtually every member </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the British aristocracy.</v>

7
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.400
<v Speaker 1>In the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was henry tutor,</v>

8
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.273
<v Speaker 1>distant cousin of the Lancaster family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who in 1485 ascended to become king </v>

9
00:00:32.691 --> 00:00:34.190
<v Speaker 1>henry the seventh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

10
00:00:34.191 --> 00:00:35.024
<v Speaker 1>to keep order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Henry has to build himself and </v>

11
00:00:36.351 --> 00:00:37.184
<v Speaker 1>aristocracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only problem is all the royals are </v>

12
00:00:39.171 --> 00:00:40.580
<v Speaker 1>dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what does he do?</v>

13
00:00:40.581 --> 00:00:42.950
<v Speaker 1>He pulls people up from the petty </v>
<v Speaker 1>nobility,</v>

14
00:00:42.951 --> 00:00:43.784
<v Speaker 1>the lower classes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and by introducing social mobility to </v>

15
00:00:46.401 --> 00:00:47.234
<v Speaker 1>Western society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he initiates what is arguably the most </v>

16
00:00:49.221 --> 00:00:51.800
<v Speaker 1>important movement in all of human </v>
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>

17
00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:53.343
<v Speaker 1>Maternity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be hard to imagine since it's </v>

18
00:00:54.531 --> 00:00:56.840
<v Speaker 1>so much a part of our lives today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but before this,</v>

19
00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:57.793
<v Speaker 1>social stratification was rigidly fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were born into a class and you </v>

20
00:01:01.191 --> 00:01:02.024
<v Speaker 1>stayed there for life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as the hierarchy was determined by </v>

21
00:01:04.431 --> 00:01:05.264
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people literally thought it was </v>

22
00:01:06.621 --> 00:01:08.690
<v Speaker 1>impossible to change their status.</v>

23
00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:09.523
<v Speaker 1>The providential plan was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>providential plans that old henry know </v>

24
00:01:11.961 --> 00:01:12.870
<v Speaker 1>what he was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

25
00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:13.813
<v Speaker 1>he was acting out of necessity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all of a sudden what the public </v>

26
00:01:15.861 --> 00:01:19.280
<v Speaker 1>thought was impossible was happening </v>
<v Speaker 1>right in front of their eyes.</v>

27
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.550
<v Speaker 1>A massive change in culture for many a </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive one,</v>

28
00:01:22.551 --> 00:01:23.384
<v Speaker 1>and because it was so positive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people began to reorganize the rules of </v>

29
00:01:27.261 --> 00:01:28.094
<v Speaker 1>their symbolic reality to accommodate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked more about symbolic reality in </v>

30
00:01:30.891 --> 00:01:34.580
<v Speaker 1>blog 46 time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Essentially it's the symbols in logic by</v>

31
00:01:34.581 --> 00:01:37.100
<v Speaker 1>which we live our lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For the first time in history,</v>

32
00:01:37.101 --> 00:01:39.980
<v Speaker 1>the word nation became synonymous with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the word people.</v>

33
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.950
<v Speaker 1>People began to govern themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make their own laws,</v>

34
00:01:42.951 --> 00:01:47.240
<v Speaker 1>and God steadily lost influence in both </v>
<v Speaker 1>political and human affairs,</v>

35
00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.430
<v Speaker 1>but in the midst of all these positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>changes,</v>

36
00:01:49.431 --> 00:01:53.150
<v Speaker 1>something very dark and very troubling </v>
<v Speaker 1>was stirring beneath the surface.</v>

37
00:01:53.151 --> 00:01:53.984
<v Speaker 1>The world's very first mental </v>
<v Speaker 1>institution place called Bedlam in </v>

38
00:01:56.661 --> 00:01:58.850
<v Speaker 1>London,</v>
<v Speaker 1>began to take on more and more.</v>

39
00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.490
<v Speaker 1>Patients cries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so hideous and so great.</v>

40
00:02:01.491 --> 00:02:03.950
<v Speaker 1>Show the inner walls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>According to one resident,</v>

41
00:02:03.951 --> 00:02:05.360
<v Speaker 1>what was happening?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

42
00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:06.373
<v Speaker 1>the widespread psychological diseases we</v>
<v Speaker 1>know today as manic depression and </v>

43
00:02:09.771 --> 00:02:10.604
<v Speaker 1>schizophrenia were being diagnosed for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the very first time in feudal England </v>

44
00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.780
<v Speaker 1>society where your lot in life was </v>
<v Speaker 1>ordained by God personal crises.</v>

45
00:02:17.781 --> 00:02:20.420
<v Speaker 1>What undermines these illnesses were </v>
<v Speaker 1>uncommon.</v>

46
00:02:20.421 --> 00:02:21.254
<v Speaker 1>You can't really fail at what you are </v>
<v Speaker 1>because your identity in a system like </v>

47
00:02:24.201 --> 00:02:26.720
<v Speaker 1>that was secured at birth in the new </v>
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>

48
00:02:26.721 --> 00:02:29.330
<v Speaker 1>the system of social mobility and </v>
<v Speaker 1>ambitious.</v>

49
00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.180
<v Speaker 1>Another word that enters common usage at</v>
<v Speaker 1>that time,</v>

50
00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:33.403
<v Speaker 1>choice becomes a part of the equation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The responsibility falls off God's </v>

51
00:02:36.641 --> 00:02:37.474
<v Speaker 1>shoulders and onto your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly you can fail at becoming what </v>

52
00:02:40.641 --> 00:02:43.250
<v Speaker 1>you want to become with no one to blame,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you.</v>

53
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.980
<v Speaker 1>This was the bittersweet upshot of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>new modern well.</v>

54
00:02:45.981 --> 00:02:49.040
<v Speaker 1>Many were reaping the positive rewards </v>
<v Speaker 1>of climbing the social ladder.</v>

55
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.730
<v Speaker 1>Others were plunging into personal </v>
<v Speaker 1>crises by failing to do so.</v>

56
00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.830
<v Speaker 1>No longer secured by the class of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>birth.</v>

57
00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.380
<v Speaker 1>Personal identity needed something to </v>
<v Speaker 1>balance out.</v>

58
00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.360
<v Speaker 1>The dark side of modernity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Enter will shakespeare.</v>

59
00:03:01.361 --> 00:03:04.500
<v Speaker 1>When new worlds are birthed from boulder</v>
<v Speaker 1>failings,</v>

60
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.470
<v Speaker 1>new logics fill the vacuum from pieces </v>
<v Speaker 1>made of the old.</v>

61
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.820
<v Speaker 1>It takes an imagination of a truly great</v>
<v Speaker 1>stature to see and think through,</v>

62
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.833
<v Speaker 1>in essence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>create the principles by which the rest </v>

63
00:03:16.001 --> 00:03:18.070
<v Speaker 1>of us can live our lives in the new </v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

64
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.930
<v Speaker 1>that kind of person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rarest of rare we call genius around</v>

65
00:03:22.931 --> 00:03:25.480
<v Speaker 1>1593.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the height of this cultural upheaval,</v>

66
00:03:25.481 --> 00:03:28.630
<v Speaker 1>Shakespeare writes Romeo and Juliet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this play,</v>

67
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:29.613
<v Speaker 1>we have basically the rule book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The best definition of what we know </v>

68
00:03:32.951 --> 00:03:33.784
<v Speaker 1>today as low no texts before this </v>
<v Speaker 1>elevates love is such an incredible </v>

69
00:03:37.481 --> 00:03:38.314
<v Speaker 1>height.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No texts is it the same quality and </v>

70
00:03:39.881 --> 00:03:43.640
<v Speaker 1>value in language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most important of symbolic system.</v>

71
00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:44.503
<v Speaker 1>Shakespeare's mine was an </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily close coordination with </v>

72
00:03:46.961 --> 00:03:47.794
<v Speaker 1>the world around him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could see what was happening to the </v>

73
00:03:49.541 --> 00:03:52.030
<v Speaker 1>people of London,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the city like most cities played host to</v>

74
00:03:52.031 --> 00:03:52.864
<v Speaker 1>a number of the mentally disabled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of whom had nowhere to go and so </v>

75
00:03:55.481 --> 00:03:56.314
<v Speaker 1>remain homeless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shakespeare sees it all and we get </v>

76
00:03:58.631 --> 00:03:59.464
<v Speaker 1>amazing diagnostic insights into these </v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions in place like King Lear and </v>

77
00:04:02.951 --> 00:04:05.920
<v Speaker 1>handled in Romeo and Juliet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He offers a solution.</v>

78
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.540
<v Speaker 1>Love the poet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>writes and signup.</v>

79
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.810
<v Speaker 1>One 16 is the star to every wandering </v>
<v Speaker 1>bark.</v>

80
00:04:10.811 --> 00:04:14.050
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the north star to every wandering mind.</v>

81
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.033
<v Speaker 1>Shakespeare effectively establishes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>loves transformative power of power for </v>

82
00:04:18.851 --> 00:04:21.960
<v Speaker 1>the average citizen that it did not have</v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

83
00:04:21.961 --> 00:04:22.794
<v Speaker 1>This kind of love is identity affirmed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To find a Romeo or Juliet is to find </v>

84
00:04:26.561 --> 00:04:27.394
<v Speaker 1>someone who will reinforce your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive identity as a person in love </v>

85
00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.010
<v Speaker 1>and extremely powerful symbolic logic.</v>

86
00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.843
<v Speaker 1>It's power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence by the sheer turmoil of </v>

87
00:04:35.951 --> 00:04:36.784
<v Speaker 1>heartbreak and Shakespeare being a </v>
<v Speaker 1>writer for the common man makes it </v>

88
00:04:38.951 --> 00:04:41.650
<v Speaker 1>something that is a clickable to anyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rich or poor.</v>

89
00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.700
<v Speaker 1>Wherever you stand in the now chaotic </v>
<v Speaker 1>social hierarchy in essence,</v>

90
00:04:45.701 --> 00:04:46.534
<v Speaker 1>and as you know it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shakespeare invented low down the </v>

91
00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:51.063
<v Speaker 1>generations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can see the impact Shakespeare has </v>

92
00:04:52.031 --> 00:04:52.864
<v Speaker 1>done more to define the current reality </v>
<v Speaker 1>still than any other person or group of </v>

93
00:04:56.741 --> 00:04:57.574
<v Speaker 1>people since he brought the culture into</v>
<v Speaker 1>his mind at a critical historical </v>

94
00:05:00.941 --> 00:05:01.774
<v Speaker 1>moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dissected it thought through the logic </v>

95
00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.170
<v Speaker 1>and expressed it for all of us in </v>
<v Speaker 1>achingly beautiful verse.</v>

96
00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:08.043
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you may wonder about texts like the </v>

97
00:05:09.221 --> 00:05:10.054
<v Speaker 1>Odyssey or Plato's symposium or Dante </v>
<v Speaker 1>via Nova because there are accounts in </v>

98
00:05:13.811 --> 00:05:17.320
<v Speaker 1>those of love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or it may nag at you that if what I said</v>

99
00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.470
<v Speaker 1>is true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that love is somehow a sham.</v>

100
00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:21.363
<v Speaker 1>As for those texts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's perhaps worth it to say that both </v>

101
00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:25.880
<v Speaker 1>affection and love were around before </v>
<v Speaker 1>Shakespeare,</v>

102
00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.510
<v Speaker 1>but the quality of love as we conceive </v>
<v Speaker 1>of it today,</v>

103
00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:29.553
<v Speaker 1>the Hollywood ness of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the applicability to all the identity </v>

104
00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:32.633
<v Speaker 1>affirming power is I think what </v>
<v Speaker 1>Shakespeare brought into the culture as </v>

105
00:05:35.581 --> 00:05:37.240
<v Speaker 1>for feeling that love is a sham.</v>

106
00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:38.283
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you feel today when you're in love </v>

107
00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:40.773
<v Speaker 1>is completely and totally real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the identity of firming power of it </v>

108
00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.480
<v Speaker 1>is real to this is how symbolic reality </v>
<v Speaker 1>works.</v>

109
00:05:46.481 --> 00:05:47.314
<v Speaker 1>It changes over time and what's real to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you and the culture at large is what's </v>

110
00:05:51.971 --> 00:05:52.804
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shakespeare is not a genius because of </v>

111
00:05:53.861 --> 00:05:54.694
<v Speaker 1>his intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a genius because of his powerful </v>

112
00:05:56.651 --> 00:05:59.150
<v Speaker 1>imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his symbolic imagination,</v>

113
00:05:59.151 --> 00:05:59.984
<v Speaker 1>his ability to bound through steps of </v>
<v Speaker 1>emerging logics and workout new </v>

114
00:06:02.901 --> 00:06:05.810
<v Speaker 1>conclusions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's incredible is that we all possess</v>

115
00:06:05.811 --> 00:06:09.530
<v Speaker 1>the exact same ability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the spectacular interplay between</v>

116
00:06:09.531 --> 00:06:13.550
<v Speaker 1>culture and the mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ladder can revolutionize the former.</v>
