1
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.900
<v Speaker 1>Bye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paul Cezanne is a painting that dawns on</v>

2
00:00:17.901 --> 00:00:22.610
<v Speaker 1>you at first you see the whole group of </v>
<v Speaker 1>women bathing by a river,</v>

3
00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:23.743
<v Speaker 1>a subject that's anything but original.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The canvas is composed in a balanced </v>

4
00:00:27.411 --> 00:00:30.320
<v Speaker 1>geometry of triangles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one for the group on the left,</v>

5
00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:31.183
<v Speaker 1>one for those on the right and one </v>
<v Speaker 1>comprising them all bounded by the </v>

6
00:00:34.821 --> 00:00:36.890
<v Speaker 1>leaning trees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but after a minute,</v>

7
00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:37.783
<v Speaker 1>you start to notice things like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>figures behind the river or the swimmer </v>

8
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.390
<v Speaker 1>in the water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or almost disturbingly,</v>

9
00:00:44.391 --> 00:00:45.224
<v Speaker 1>that none of the bathers have any </v>
<v Speaker 1>definable faces or that their bodies </v>

10
00:00:48.681 --> 00:00:52.010
<v Speaker 1>seemed to fold into one another as if </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd been painted over,</v>

11
00:00:52.011 --> 00:00:55.280
<v Speaker 1>but not completely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The more you stare at it,</v>

12
00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:56.143
<v Speaker 1>the more the canvas seems a chaos of </v>
<v Speaker 1>elements deliriously rendered with the </v>

13
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.610
<v Speaker 1>spontaneity that feels almost negligent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

14
00:01:04.611 --> 00:01:05.444
<v Speaker 1>we know that Cezanne labored on this </v>
<v Speaker 1>painting for seven years all the way up </v>

15
00:01:09.231 --> 00:01:10.064
<v Speaker 1>to his death.</v>

16
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.620
<v Speaker 1>Spontaneity is certainly part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>message,</v>

17
00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:13.603
<v Speaker 1>but the painter was intensely purposeful</v>
<v Speaker 1>in what he wanted to say and how he </v>

18
00:01:17.901 --> 00:01:18.734
<v Speaker 1>wanted to convey it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From our perspective across the Gulf of </v>

19
00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.740
<v Speaker 1>cubism and all imaginable forms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>abstraction,</v>

20
00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.300
<v Speaker 1>it's hard for us Cezanne's distortions </v>
<v Speaker 1>of color and form to shock us,</v>

21
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.910
<v Speaker 1>yet that's exactly what they did in 19 </v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

22
00:01:31.911 --> 00:01:34.340
<v Speaker 1>six.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the paintings first exhibition.</v>

23
00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.500
<v Speaker 1>It's not wrong to say that Cezanne </v>
<v Speaker 1>initiated what became the 20th century's</v>

24
00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.070
<v Speaker 1>endless experimentation as Picasso </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself said,</v>

25
00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.910
<v Speaker 1>Cezanne is the father of us all in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

26
00:01:46.911 --> 00:01:47.744
<v Speaker 1>He can sort of be seen as the bridge </v>
<v Speaker 1>between what came before and all that </v>

27
00:01:52.251 --> 00:01:55.400
<v Speaker 1>was to come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The large bathers reaches in the past.</v>

28
00:01:55.401 --> 00:01:56.234
<v Speaker 1>We're calling similar scenes of nudes or</v>
<v Speaker 1>bathers like those by Titian or Nicola </v>

29
00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.903
<v Speaker 1>who sewn or Thomas Eakins among others </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain of the figures of vote postures </v>

30
00:02:04.851 --> 00:02:05.960
<v Speaker 1>from older works.</v>

31
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.780
<v Speaker 1>The women on the left striding upwards </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the tree,</v>

32
00:02:08.781 --> 00:02:09.614
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bears a resemblance to an 18th century </v>

33
00:02:11.871 --> 00:02:12.704
<v Speaker 1>sculpture of the goddess Diana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or take the woman on the right here </v>

34
00:02:16.161 --> 00:02:16.994
<v Speaker 1>who's raised knee and shoulders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember the classical Venus de Milo by </v>

35
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.890
<v Speaker 1>Alexandros of Antioch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and perhaps it should be noted that none</v>

36
00:02:24.891 --> 00:02:29.450
<v Speaker 1>of the 14 women we see here were drawn </v>
<v Speaker 1>from real models.</v>

37
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.410
<v Speaker 1>Suzanne took his examples from other </v>
<v Speaker 1>works and picture books,</v>

38
00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:34.423
<v Speaker 1>adding to that disquieting sense of </v>
<v Speaker 1>remove that these figures have from any </v>

39
00:02:38.541 --> 00:02:39.374
<v Speaker 1>identifiable personalities that remove </v>
<v Speaker 1>that alienation is echoed everywhere in </v>

40
00:02:44.661 --> 00:02:45.494
<v Speaker 1>the painting of the 14 women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six or simply turned away from the </v>

41
00:02:48.741 --> 00:02:49.574
<v Speaker 1>viewer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a few or even in the process of </v>

42
00:02:50.721 --> 00:02:54.200
<v Speaker 1>dissolving or emerging from the foliage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All around them,</v>

43
00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.490
<v Speaker 1>most unsettling have all the figures are</v>
<v Speaker 1>pocked with areas of white,</v>

44
00:02:58.491 --> 00:03:02.950
<v Speaker 1>which on closer examination proves not </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be any paint at all,</v>

45
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.993
<v Speaker 1>but the bare canvas itself interrupting </v>
<v Speaker 1>the scene as if some force from a world </v>

46
00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:11.890
<v Speaker 1>beyond what is Cezanne trying to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

47
00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:12.724
<v Speaker 1>what are these disturbances amount to </v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the effects of his short flat </v>

48
00:03:16.811 --> 00:03:17.644
<v Speaker 1>brush strokes of distilling everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>into its geometrical basis or freezing </v>

49
00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:25.570
<v Speaker 1>in paint that which doesn't appear to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>a scene at all,</v>

50
00:03:25.571 --> 00:03:26.404
<v Speaker 1>but something on the verge of becoming a</v>
<v Speaker 1>scene where else have dissolving out of </v>

51
00:03:31.031 --> 00:03:34.120
<v Speaker 1>one Cezanne is emerging out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>impressionism.</v>

52
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:35.043
<v Speaker 1>A movement that was obsessed with how </v>
<v Speaker 1>colors and light really appeared to the </v>

53
00:03:39.521 --> 00:03:41.110
<v Speaker 1>eye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did the atmosphere,</v>

54
00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.760
<v Speaker 1>the rain or the sunset effect the visual</v>
<v Speaker 1>impression of the Observer?</v>

55
00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:46.623
<v Speaker 1>The impressionists explored this by </v>
<v Speaker 1>going out into nature and painting </v>

56
00:03:49.781 --> 00:03:53.770
<v Speaker 1>rapidly applying just what they saw to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the canvas in front of them.</v>

57
00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.440
<v Speaker 1>Cezanne took the pallet of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>impressionists,</v>

58
00:03:56.441 --> 00:03:57.274
<v Speaker 1>retaining the brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>often surprising colors used to evoke </v>

59
00:04:00.221 --> 00:04:01.054
<v Speaker 1>nature's effect on us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he took color a step further and </v>

60
00:04:04.241 --> 00:04:05.074
<v Speaker 1>applied it to express form as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ever since the renaissance depth was </v>

61
00:04:09.281 --> 00:04:10.114
<v Speaker 1>rendered via perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cezanne seems to realize that </v>

62
00:04:13.811 --> 00:04:18.811
<v Speaker 1>renaissance perspective is only a kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of code by which we understand the third</v>

63
00:04:19.541 --> 00:04:20.374
<v Speaker 1>dimension and a canvas seeing itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The perception as distinct from the </v>

64
00:04:24.401 --> 00:04:27.280
<v Speaker 1>understanding may not work on those </v>
<v Speaker 1>principles.</v>

65
00:04:27.281 --> 00:04:28.114
<v Speaker 1>It may be far more unruly than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why he didn't shy away from </v>

66
00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:36.850
<v Speaker 1>distortion of objects of using colors to</v>
<v Speaker 1>bring elements in the background forward</v>

67
00:04:36.851 --> 00:04:37.684
<v Speaker 1>or melt things in the foreground into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the architecture of colors that hold </v>

68
00:04:41.441 --> 00:04:42.030
<v Speaker 1>them there.</v>

69
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:47.030
<v Speaker 1>There's a difference between the way we </v>
<v Speaker 1>know what we see and how we actually see</v>

70
00:04:47.831 --> 00:04:48.664
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our minds are so incredibly good at </v>

71
00:04:50.921 --> 00:04:51.754
<v Speaker 1>taking the anarchic varieties of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sensible experience and within </v>

72
00:04:55.301 --> 00:04:58.870
<v Speaker 1>milliseconds composing them into </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligible holes.</v>

73
00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.973
<v Speaker 1>It happens so fast that we can't even </v>
<v Speaker 1>access that actual moment of perception </v>

74
00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.650
<v Speaker 1>and for the most part we should be happy</v>
<v Speaker 1>about that because raw experience like a</v>

75
00:05:08.651 --> 00:05:12.600
<v Speaker 1>kind of trauma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just too much for us to extend.</v>

76
00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.913
<v Speaker 1>In the large bathers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cezanne uses his various techniques to </v>

77
00:05:16.811 --> 00:05:20.650
<v Speaker 1>visit that moment of perception,</v>
<v Speaker 1>confronted with it aesthetically.</v>

78
00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:25.830
<v Speaker 1>All that's unsettling about experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>is frozen for our contemplation in life.</v>

79
00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:27.603
<v Speaker 1>It's a bridge we just can't cross and </v>
<v Speaker 1>take a look at that man on the other </v>

80
00:05:30.521 --> 00:05:31.354
<v Speaker 1>side of the river.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many think that this figure is cezanne </v>

81
00:05:33.791 --> 00:05:34.624
<v Speaker 1>himself situated between the classical </v>
<v Speaker 1>constructed dire ama have bathers and </v>

82
00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:42.610
<v Speaker 1>the pastoral impressionistic church </v>
<v Speaker 1>scene in the distance.</v>

83
00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:47.440
<v Speaker 1>Now I bet if we could turn the painting </v>
<v Speaker 1>around and see it from that perspective,</v>

84
00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:48.573
<v Speaker 1>it would look just as sensual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>erotic and beautiful as something by </v>

85
00:05:51.461 --> 00:05:55.480
<v Speaker 1>Titian or any other painter who depicted</v>
<v Speaker 1>a similar scene in the past,</v>

86
00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:00.170
<v Speaker 1>but from our vantage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one Cezanne gave to us,</v>

87
00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:05.530
<v Speaker 1>we're allowed a fugitive access to </v>
<v Speaker 1>something far more disturbing the wheel.</v>

88
00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:15.461
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody,</v>

89
00:06:15.461 --> 00:06:17.620
<v Speaker 1>if you want to help me keep making these</v>
<v Speaker 1>videos,</v>

90
00:06:17.621 --> 00:06:20.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing a big push for patrion </v>
<v Speaker 1>pledges.</v>

91
00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:22.990
<v Speaker 1>Everything helps as little as $1 per </v>
<v Speaker 1>video.</v>

92
00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:24.243
<v Speaker 1>It really is the pledges that allow me </v>
<v Speaker 1>to continue making this channel and you </v>

93
00:06:27.991 --> 00:06:28.811
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more I get,</v>

94
00:06:28.811 --> 00:06:29.644
<v Speaker 1>the more time and effort I can spend on </v>
<v Speaker 1>making really cool stuff and I have a </v>

95
00:06:33.131 --> 00:06:37.360
<v Speaker 1>lot of stuff in the works right now </v>
<v Speaker 1>which is going to be really great if you</v>

96
00:06:37.361 --> 00:06:38.194
<v Speaker 1>think the nerd writer is something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not seeing anywhere else and you </v>

97
00:06:40.541 --> 00:06:41.374
<v Speaker 1>want to see more of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pledging is really the way to help </v>

98
00:06:43.511 --> 00:06:44.740
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So thank you so much.</v>

99
00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.750
<v Speaker 1>And here are some more videos.</v>
