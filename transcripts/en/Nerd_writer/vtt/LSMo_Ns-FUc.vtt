1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:00.863
<v Speaker 1>Hey y'all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you phenoms and filibusters coffee on a </v>

2
00:00:02.461 --> 00:00:05.550
<v Speaker 1>Tuesday and Vlog 56.</v>

3
00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.973
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I cheated a lot in high school and </v>

4
00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:22.154
<v Speaker 1>college usually was by the old classic </v>
<v Speaker 1>method of just looking over at the </v>

5
00:00:24.321 --> 00:00:25.154
<v Speaker 1>person's test next to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I'd write information on a </v>

6
00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:32.110
<v Speaker 1>little crib sheet or save stuff in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>trusty ti 83 calculator and I do vaguely</v>

7
00:00:32.481 --> 00:00:33.314
<v Speaker 1>remember trying to steal tests from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>teacher's desk once though I can't be </v>

8
00:00:36.291 --> 00:00:39.530
<v Speaker 1>sure if that was only something I saw in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a movie.</v>

9
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.210
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>

10
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.050
<v Speaker 1>Mostly I cheated on tests or homework.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never really on term papers.</v>

11
00:00:45.051 --> 00:00:45.884
<v Speaker 1>I never plagiarize for some reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Getting caught plagiarizing seemed like </v>

12
00:00:48.321 --> 00:00:50.720
<v Speaker 1>the worst thing that could happen to you</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was in school.</v>

13
00:00:50.721 --> 00:00:53.630
<v Speaker 1>Although for my very final paper in </v>
<v Speaker 1>college,</v>

14
00:00:53.631 --> 00:00:57.800
<v Speaker 1>I did hand in my roommate's history </v>
<v Speaker 1>essay on the Nazis.</v>

15
00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.980
<v Speaker 1>I was taking a sociology class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know the Nazis,</v>

16
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.040
<v Speaker 1>they really cover a lot of ground </v>
<v Speaker 1>already.</v>

17
00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:09.103
<v Speaker 1>I haven't spent a lot of time thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it since really I didn't think </v>

18
00:01:11.361 --> 00:01:15.770
<v Speaker 1>about it much at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose I just knew that the old adage</v>

19
00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:16.783
<v Speaker 1>cheaters never win,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which just a cracker because I cheated </v>

20
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.640
<v Speaker 1>and one now I don't encourage cheating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course not,</v>

21
00:01:22.641 --> 00:01:26.360
<v Speaker 1>but it is a part of my life and I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's worth exploring a little bit more.</v>

22
00:01:26.361 --> 00:01:30.950
<v Speaker 1>Cheating is simply acting dishonestly to</v>
<v Speaker 1>gain an advantage in high school.</v>

23
00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.030
<v Speaker 1>What was the advantage that I wanted or </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought I needed to gain?</v>

24
00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.500
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where I went to school,</v>

25
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.260
<v Speaker 1>the primary purpose of school was not to</v>
<v Speaker 1>learn,</v>

26
00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.730
<v Speaker 1>although that was not a negative upshot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The primary purpose of school was to get</v>

27
00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.760
<v Speaker 1>good grades so we could get into a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>college,</v>

28
00:01:46.761 --> 00:01:47.594
<v Speaker 1>so when we graduated we'd have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>empirically proven advantage of getting </v>

29
00:01:51.261 --> 00:01:54.190
<v Speaker 1>a good job so we wouldn't be degenerate.</v>

30
00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.570
<v Speaker 1>The motivational structures were </v>
<v Speaker 1>achingly clear.</v>

31
00:01:56.571 --> 00:02:00.590
<v Speaker 1>The point was to get good grades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to get good grades.</v>

32
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.870
<v Speaker 1>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only reason to act honestly was that</v>

33
00:02:02.871 --> 00:02:05.300
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't run the risk of getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>caught cheating,</v>

34
00:02:05.301 --> 00:02:06.134
<v Speaker 1>which would after all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>injure your ability to achieve the goal </v>

35
00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.510
<v Speaker 1>in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ironic thing is that so pressured as</v>

36
00:02:11.511 --> 00:02:15.320
<v Speaker 1>we were to achieve the good grade and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the good college and the good job,</v>

37
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.273
<v Speaker 1>we saw no qualms in cheating to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and having cheated to get there </v>

38
00:02:19.491 --> 00:02:23.180
<v Speaker 1>and having got there with the good job </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a world where cheating is much,</v>

39
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:24.103
<v Speaker 1>much less viable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all have work ethics that are </v>

40
00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:31.570
<v Speaker 1>absolute and we're all that much closer </v>
<v Speaker 1>to being degenerate.</v>

41
00:02:31.611 --> 00:02:32.444
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I laugh about that randomly on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the subway or just walking down the </v>

42
00:02:34.881 --> 00:02:35.714
<v Speaker 1>street and people look at me strangely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just the kind of joke that's </v>

43
00:02:37.941 --> 00:02:40.250
<v Speaker 1>too damn funny to keep in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

44
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.920
<v Speaker 1>Can you blame me for cheating?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course you can.</v>

45
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:43.793
<v Speaker 1>I cheated and I'm not the only one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A rutgers study from way back in 1997 </v>

46
00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.943
<v Speaker 1>before there were sat prep courses that </v>
<v Speaker 1>surveyed 1800 people in nine state </v>

47
00:02:52.761 --> 00:02:53.594
<v Speaker 1>university's found that three fourths,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three out of four people cheated on </v>

48
00:02:57.951 --> 00:03:00.610
<v Speaker 1>exams were written and you can blame </v>
<v Speaker 1>them too.</v>

49
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.730
<v Speaker 1>But the epidemic of cheating in school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in science,</v>

50
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.460
<v Speaker 1>in sports is something that we're all on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hook for.</v>

51
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:08.403
<v Speaker 1>And let's never buy into that bullshit </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I am the only one responsible for </v>

52
00:03:12.311 --> 00:03:13.144
<v Speaker 1>my actions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or you or the only one responsible for </v>

53
00:03:15.221 --> 00:03:18.310
<v Speaker 1>yours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're all responsible for one another in</v>

54
00:03:18.311 --> 00:03:21.280
<v Speaker 1>each active cheating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We performed a cost benefit analysis.</v>

55
00:03:21.281 --> 00:03:23.920
<v Speaker 1>Think of the 16 year old me taking that </v>
<v Speaker 1>physics exam.</v>

56
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.250
<v Speaker 1>If I get caught,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I may get a bad grade on the test,</v>

57
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.040
<v Speaker 1>a call home to my parents or detention.</v>

58
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.220
<v Speaker 1>Detention is nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

59
00:03:32.221 --> 00:03:33.054
<v Speaker 1>call into to my parents sucks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they only want me to get good </v>

60
00:03:34.961 --> 00:03:37.210
<v Speaker 1>grades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a bad grade sucks too.</v>

61
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.650
<v Speaker 1>But my teachers and my school was what </v>
<v Speaker 1>my parents wanted for me to succeed.</v>

62
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:42.513
<v Speaker 1>If I don't get caught,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll have successfully bypass work that </v>

63
00:03:45.011 --> 00:03:45.844
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to do in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'll have moved further down that </v>

64
00:03:48.131 --> 00:03:51.550
<v Speaker 1>motivational yellow brick road that </v>
<v Speaker 1>leads to a good career.</v>

65
00:03:51.551 --> 00:03:53.150
<v Speaker 1>And of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

66
00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.050
<v Speaker 1>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the upper middleclass version of us,</v>

67
00:03:56.051 --> 00:03:58.030
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

68
00:03:58.031 --> 00:03:58.864
<v Speaker 1>a fondue maker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just watch madmen cheating is an </v>

69
00:04:00.671 --> 00:04:01.504
<v Speaker 1>activity latent in all nature as a way </v>
<v Speaker 1>for organisms to gain an advantage </v>

70
00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:05.763
<v Speaker 1>without incurring the costs of effort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was reading recently that pseudomonas </v>

71
00:04:08.711 --> 00:04:09.544
<v Speaker 1>bacteria exploit the goods generated by </v>
<v Speaker 1>cooperating bacteria without sharing in </v>

72
00:04:13.751 --> 00:04:14.584
<v Speaker 1>the production.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those bastards fish cheap primates </v>

73
00:04:16.931 --> 00:04:18.340
<v Speaker 1>cheat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We cheat on tests,</v>

74
00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:21.430
<v Speaker 1>on diets on the Tour de France,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on spouses,</v>

75
00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:23.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's the rub.</v>

76
00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.340
<v Speaker 1>Infidelity is a kind of cheating that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's impossible for us to justify,</v>

77
00:04:27.341 --> 00:04:28.174
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's the abuse of relationships </v>

78
00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:30.963
<v Speaker 1>for personal gain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's easy for us to feel why it's wrong </v>

79
00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:34.713
<v Speaker 1>to exploit another person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially someone so invested in us as </v>

80
00:04:37.961 --> 00:04:42.130
<v Speaker 1>a significant other for a cheap thrill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As we move out of the educational system</v>

81
00:04:42.131 --> 00:04:44.650
<v Speaker 1>with it's painfully mistaken </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivational cues,</v>

82
00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:45.663
<v Speaker 1>it becomes clear to us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It became clear to me that this is the </v>

83
00:04:48.221 --> 00:04:49.054
<v Speaker 1>foundation of all kinds of cheating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the leveraging of another person for </v>

84
00:04:52.691 --> 00:04:53.524
<v Speaker 1>personal betterment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we all know how levers work as </v>

85
00:04:56.381 --> 00:04:57.214
<v Speaker 1>someone moves up someone else somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps by subtle conduits gets pushed </v>

86
00:05:01.761 --> 00:05:02.710
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This I suspect,</v>

87
00:05:02.711 --> 00:05:05.200
<v Speaker 1>is the true meaning of that adage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cheaters never win,</v>

88
00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:06.153
<v Speaker 1>even if you get away with it out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you're not aware of the </v>

89
00:05:08.861 --> 00:05:09.694
<v Speaker 1>consequences of your actions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can never truly get away with it in </v>

90
00:05:13.271 --> 00:05:14.104
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for the sake of honesty and a less </v>

91
00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.460
<v Speaker 1>rainbow sunset,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything is lovely.</v>

92
00:05:18.461 --> 00:05:23.461
<v Speaker 1>And we'll work out ending to this vlog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me ask you cheater,</v>

93
00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:26.260
<v Speaker 1>have you gotten away with it?</v>

94
00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:33.340
<v Speaker 2>Not just my work as a.</v>

95
00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.650
<v Speaker 1>hi everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry the Vlog is so late this week.</v>

96
00:05:45.651 --> 00:05:46.484
<v Speaker 1>The reason is that I was sent up to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Boston earlier this week to cover the </v>

97
00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:51.860
<v Speaker 1>marathon bombing story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

98
00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.950
<v Speaker 1>a surreal and unexpected week to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

99
00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:56.930
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so thanks for sticking with it.</v>

100
00:05:56.931 --> 00:05:59.900
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully we can get back on schedule </v>
<v Speaker 1>for next week and,</v>

101
00:05:59.901 --> 00:06:02.180
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll see you next time.</v>
