Speaker 1:          00:07          Before you see one single image in the Lord of the Rings trilogy and you hear a chorus singing in a somewhat unsettling harmonic minor key over black, this is a musical theme that signals the Loft Florian else. It's the theme of glad drill, who's about to narrate the story of the one ring and prologue, but not before the rings. Own feet fades in with the first title as the prologue ends and an e flat minor chord shifts to an e flat major. The narration shifts also from collateral to Bilbo Sean and the mood changes. The lighter shyer theme is introduced as Bilbo places us there on a map and finally, after he places us in time, the fellowship theme plays in full statement as its corresponding subtitled fades in racketing, the opening of the film.

Speaker 1:          01:16          Now, if this masterful interplay of themes is it enough to prove to you already that composer Howard shore is a genius, that's okay. There's a lot more to say. The first thing is that these four themes that I've mentioned are actually what's called light motifs and operatic technique popularized by Richard Wagner, that fuses musical themes with specific people, events or places to eat, and in some cases augment the dramatic development of a story. In order to show how short develops his light motifs. I'm going to isolate one the fellowship theme, which has the most variations and focus on its development in the fellowship of the ring. Now before the fellowship theme can come together in its full heroic glory short, builds it up with a few variations. The first time we hear it after the title is when Frodo and Sam leave. The Shire on the road to Rivendale short presents a small snippet of the shyer theme of foreshadowing of that themes, final variation at the end of the film, and then transitions into a humble statement of the fellowship theme using just French Horn and core, and Glen.

Speaker 1:          02:26          It's a dangerous business for them going out gentle. This is almost immediately contrasted with another darker variation as Gandalf rides into isengard to take counsel with Sal. Roma sure adds crashing cymbals and plays the theme off Gandalf's galloping horse in this tense variation, prefigure Sarah Mons eventual portrayal, and the two versions playing off each other, anticipate the eventual fracturing of the fellowship later in the film. The next time we hear the theme, Frodo and the hobbits have accepted stridor or eric as their temporary leader. The fellowship is growing, so the brass section is growing too. We started with one French horn. Now we have three, but the state lead melody of the student is upset with the Timpani drumbeat that adds urgency. The Fellowship Light Motif doesn't appear again until after Frodo has been stabbed by the ring greats as our when racist to get him to Rivendale. The fellowship theme mixes with a Raytheon threatening to overtake it. The fellowship might dissolve before it even has a chance to fully

Speaker 2:          03:29          form

Speaker 1:          03:35          at the middle of the film. The fellowship finally comes together and sure echoes that by presenting a string of three fellowship theme statements in their full orchestration and full glory. First as l, Ron announces the fellowship third as the fellowship strides heroically away on own

Speaker 2:          03:55          quest.

Speaker 1:          04:03          But the second one is the most interesting to me, just as the fellowship is about to depart. Shore softly teases the Shire theme before eight is overpowered by the fellowship theme, suggesting that the hobbits priorities have shifted and they now have to live with the consequences of that, and it ends with a unique harmony on the second half of the full statement as if to sow a seed of doubt right into the middle of the team. As it comes together,

Speaker 2:          04:29          fellowship,

Speaker 1:          04:34          we're going to get another exciting full statement in the mines of Moria. The only time that the nine members of the fellowship will be an action together, but the three, four time signature of the fellowship is quickly swallowed up by the five four time signature of the orcs and from now on, after Gandalf is lost, the fellowship theme will only appear in fragmented form until the very end of the trilogy. Your foods, for example, after what's left with the fellowship departs Laurian. The theme can only muster violins and cor. Anglais and sure has this already weak variation trampled on as soon as it starts. Then as they rest on the shore, the light motif can't find its footing. It wanders away from its full expression as uncertainty and suspicion creep, been facing these insecure variations on the theme, Harold, the breaking of the fellowship, first with the death of former, then with the departure of Frodo and Sam, in fact, short links these two moments with a severely deflated but poignant rendition of the light motif that fades into silence

Speaker 1:          05:57          like the fellowship itself. The fellowship theme builds to its full formation and then is deconstructed until it's only a shell of its former self. Shore does this with instrumentation, with tempo and with harmony, and he does it for several other light motifs in the trilogy, weaving them back and forth and through one another so that the result is a complex web that entwines with the story. I think that we hardly grasp the importance of music in film. It's an invisible layer of pure emotion that guides us or challenges us or guides or challenges. The drama itself and the Lord of the rings trilogy. Howard shore gave us perhaps the most complete and complex exploration of light motifs in the history of cinema and the result is a score that says alive as the world Tokyo gave us.
