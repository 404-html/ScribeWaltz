Speaker 1:          00:00          I try to make it seem like I'm just getting this out, but I know all the moves. I know every little piece of it

Speaker 2:          00:11          just here, just go here.

Speaker 1:          00:15          This is what a Louis Ck joke looks like. It's a short one, only 207 words, but there are 207 words that are chosen, very purposefully practiced until every one counts for something. Today, I want to go through this joke beat by beat and explore how Louis C K Constructs and performs his comedy. My girls are six and nine now. They're actually a really exciting age because they're learning to do some cool stuff. I played monopoly with my kids. That's really fun. Every joke has to have a premise, an idea that the inevitable punchline will snap comedically into place. The premise should be really clear whether it's implied as in some one liners or stated outright. As Chris rock once said, a lot of comedians have great jokes and they don't like, why isn't this working? It's not working because the audience does not understand the premise. In this case, the premise has two parts accomplished in two senses. First Louis is playing monopoly with his daughters and second, my nine year old. She can totally do monopoly. This world actually totally gets how the game works, but she's not as emotionally developed enough

Speaker 3:          01:22          to handle her inevitable loss in every game of monopoly.

Speaker 1:          01:27          The second part of this premise is beautifully structured because besides very lucidly delivering the premise that this joke is going to be our six year old girl learns what it means to lose in monopoly. Louis, we actually get some laughs out of the sentence by the addition of a couple of words and a strategic rhythm. I mean the simplest way to end this sentence is to say that she's not emotionally developed enough to handle losing it monopoly, but instead he said

Speaker 3:          01:52          to handle her inevitable loss in every game with monopoly.

Speaker 1:          01:57          In this way, Louis adds to little comedic surprises in the premise and make sure to include a pause so that each can be appreciated in their own.

Speaker 3:          02:06          How to handle her inevitable loss in every game with monopoly,

Speaker 1:          02:11          because the monopoly last is dark.

Speaker 2:          02:15          It's heavy

Speaker 1:          02:17          mediums like Louis CK, are experienced enough to master not only their own delivery, but where the laughs will occur in their jokes and how to deal with them. Telling a joke is like riding a wave of feeling and if you watch Louis Ck is comedy, you'll see that during laughs. What he does is emphasize his last line. It doesn't give the audience new information. He augments the information just given something that he actually learned how to do brilliantly from Jerry Seinfeld. I'm opening for Jerry in front of like 12, $100 or $20, 2,500 people and people are applauding bits and I had never encountered that and I didn't know how to handle it. I asked Jerry what to do and he said, you stay in the bed, you stay in the. They're reacting to if you're angry and that's why they're applauding. You stay in that energy because a monopoly laws is dark.

Speaker 2:          03:08          It's heavy

Speaker 1:          03:13          candy.

Speaker 4:          03:17          Maybe you didn't get to win.

Speaker 1:          03:22          The choice of candyland here though Louis acts as if it was pulled out of thin air is the perfect counterpoint to monopoly. It's visual, the game pop straight into your mind is an object of colorful innocence. The drama and the funny voice is also performed like it was spontaneously made up, but the words and the images he uses like Fudgie thing and gummy twilio's are carefully chosen to enhance that visual sense. Louis is never not in control and that's important because since the premise has been so strongly set up in the counterpoint drawn out so vividly, the laughs that Louis gets here or actually lapsed in anticipation of a punchline, not yet said the audience is already imagining how dark the monopoly last is going to be. Just watch how he gradually increases these anticipatory laughs like the audience is a fiddle to the final three word punchline, but when she loses it monopoly, I got to look at her little face and I go, okay, so here's what's going to happen

Speaker 2:          04:19          now. Okay,

Speaker 1:          04:21          all your property,

Speaker 2:          04:22          everything you have, the railroads, your houses, all your money, that's mine. Now gotta, give it all to me. Give it to me.

Speaker 1:          04:36          One thing Louis doesn't get recognized for enough, in my opinion, is his ability to dramatize in his jokes when he acts out this conversation with his daughter. The light touchy gifts, especially with that hand movement right on the punchline, really locks the audience into the space where he wants them to be. The audience needs to see the situation from a six year old perspective for it to work. Then if he succeeded, the tags or the two additional punchlines that follow will be that much more devastating.

Speaker 2:          05:04          Hilarious and no, no, you can't play anymore a see because even though you're giving me all of that, it didn't even touch how much you owe me. Doesn't even touch it. Baby. Going down to heart is really bad.

Speaker 1:          05:19          Putting the audience in the perspective of a six year old is important for another reason because I think on a deeper level, Louis is actually trying to make a comment here on the actual ruthlessness of the economy we live in where property really is taken away from people sometimes by monopolistic interests, with debt to spare. That's the thing. His daughter is not emotionally developed enough to comprehend and when we see it through her eyes, the reality seems even darker than it usually does, especially in the final tab. All you been working for all,

Speaker 2:          05:53          hey, I'm going to take it now and I'm going use it to destroy

Speaker 1:          05:58          your sister. Just mayhem on this board for her. Now you know more than anything else, I think I'm obsessed with articulation, with the magic of putting things just the right way. There are 207 words in this joke and not a single one is wasted. They're used either in meaning or in rhythm to contribute to the overall effect and effect that lets us see the world from a different angle and more importantly makes us laugh like great poetry, great standup comedy is language distilled to its most potent form and these days few people distill it better than Louis Ck.
