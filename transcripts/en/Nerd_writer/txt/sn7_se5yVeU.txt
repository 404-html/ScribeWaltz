Speaker 1:          00:10          Hey

Speaker 2:          00:10          everybody, so a lot of people out there have been asking me about my writing and whether or not there's something of mine that you can read. Well, today I'm going to be releasing my first book, Big City, which I wrote about a year ago on gumroad.com, a digital copy for $3. Now I hope that you think that that's fair. I put a lot of work into this and I don't think it's so much money where you know if you don't like the book, you feel that you've wasted it. Obviously though, I hope that you do like it. You can find the link for the full text in the dupe later today. I'm going to be reading the first part of it for you firstly because I love to read and listen to fiction. Secondly, because it'll give you guys a chance to see what the book will be like.

Speaker 2:          00:54          Now, just a few words here before I get started. In the way of a summary, imagine that you're reading the back flap here in the bookstore. As the title suggests, the story is about a big city and impossibly big city of vast urban sprawl that goes on and on in every direction of city you couldn't possibly see all of in a lifetime and one in which people get so easily lost in the confusion of streets and high rises and bars and moving lights. It's a science fiction setting, certainly influenced by cyber punk, but the story is about eight people who are trying to live and survive in this chaotic mess of a place and who are all experiencing this very unique and strange phenomenon called seeing the whole thing. Now there is a secret buried in the story about what the city is, what seeing the whole thing means about what they're all doing there, but of course you have to read the whole thing to find out what that what that is. Okay, so go to a dark place, getting them, getting the mood. Here's the first part of big city called Mac ludgate.

Speaker 2:          02:06          Mac ludgate returned from the [inaudible] region, also called coat Malai, province and sector 22 way without a tatter of currency to his name. He had begun his sojourn to that blistery junction of try district gambling, not six months before dreaming of a streak, but all he got was a dark new appreciation for settling debts. He picked the scab on his forehead and thought this is ready to fall off as the automated female voice recording spat out the name of his home district now entering loan and district Taj Zhou Province municipal sector 25. A change here for all silverline. Tram stores will open on my right and again in three alternate languages, but he was wrong about the scab. It bled. Here were the things Mac knew as he stepped from the tram into loan n one, he could stay at Shelly's for as long as he liked to. The ice on most of his bets was covered. He had little to worry about in the way of rancorous businessmen. Three, he was guaranteed at least one free meal everyday at his uncle Warren's restaurant on the corner of 15th and Catskill Street, and four, there was every chance that Mr Hoy econ would hire him back to his old position at lm and p. So long as Hoy con didn't know that mack was living with his daughter, he nestled himself into the cocoon of these near certainties and use them as a coat against the unseasonable. Cold

Speaker 2:          03:24          loan and station was empty and they'll mac could not recall the time when it was otherwise. The space provoked in him, the feeling of being only recently abandoned by a host of people, strange that anyone would gather here he said to himself as a rush of hot air, move through the terminal and at once vivified his suspicions with paralyzing emphasis, hints of Phantom Card players, eyes receding into their sockets. Rhinestone whores, toothless, always smiling, the flotsam of degeneracy behind every corner. He was sure of it. Mac blinked rapidly to dispel these apparitions, but captured instead the after images of dusty fluorescents that spread light through the station all thin and dry, more ghosts. They had followed him here. Nerves short circuited. Oh God. Six months of uppers withdraw. His heart raced away and these silly tricks of the night, so affected Max eggshell spirit that he ran from loan and station and a boyish frenzy fleeing a host of illusory terrorists.

Speaker 2:          04:22          Shelly grave lived on the east side of loan end in a triplex behind Jefferson Park, near Uncle Warren's restaurant on 15th have a building that small was a rare commodity and loan n and rare is still. She and her daughter Lisa occupied the whole first floor. Most of that district's population was crammed into the row of towering apartment blocks that lined the far edge of town, but shelly had gotten years ago at a low fixed rent before prices rose drastically. District wide fluctuations of that kind were frequent and all sectors of the city like when through skyscraper and streets and unexplainable as a matter of course. Why this particular rent stayed fixed is easy enough to puzzle out if you know Shelly Mac

Speaker 2:          05:05          knocked on her door, hasn't hesitantly in a way a man does when he is merely trying to prove to himself that he was there and did that thing. Really. He was of two minds, he needed rest and warm sometime for his nerves to settle. This was clear from the episode at the Tram Station, but being here bashfully, knocking like a teenager, Matt could not help but recognize a scene from a story played over and over. It annoyed him to know what shelly would say when she opened the door, how he would respond, where the night would go, what the next day would bring and so forth. He wanted desperately to deviate from this plot, but it was hopeless. His character always wanted to deviate in the scene to do something impetuous or dangerous or just plain wrong, but never did. So shelly opened the door and the story played on, look, a millionaire.

Speaker 2:          05:52          Yeah, and it's all yours. He pushed fire. What's that smell? Does that fish? Where did you get fish from? So you expect to come in and what? She had already botched the practice speech. Jump in bed with this is in your world. I'm walking around and Mac, listen to me. I give my arm for a dose of Xeno. Got Any, but he had already spotted traces on the coffee table, tiny blue speck, sprinkled over the smiles of magazine cover girls and grocery store coupons. He turned over an issue of celebrity health with the famous actress Jocelyn Marquette, posing candidly on the cover and there it was. The feebly hid porcelain jar. No data piece. Spade my, her daughter Lisa in school. Bingo Mac. Join me, will you? We can yell at each other tomorrow. I'm deadbeat. He dropped a small blue tablet into his pipe. One thing he had not lost in Cotana and ground it down with the bud of the pen.

Speaker 2:          06:44          One long drag and stupidity crashed over his mind. Simplicity. Yes. The end of all thought. He passed the pipe to shelly who seemed to have given up her protests at site of the drug. She was thinking, well, finish this tomorrow and took a drag for herself, a sweet repos. She nestled herself into the crook of his arm and together they sank into the red round cushions of the couch. Nothing moved. The television was tuned to one of those channels which only plays music probably because shelly couldn't afford a full entertainment package. The noise was faint, but Mac caught enough to discern which channel it was he needed to have heard it. Though shelly only ever played one station this late at night, particularly when she was dosing city reflections. Istation, unlike any other, it's sole purpose was to catch old frequencies that had been broadcast and set bouncing into the city sound maze of a trillion buildings.

Speaker 2:          07:37          You might hear something on reflections that had been played a thousand years ago in a province you would never know the name of, but who could say after all that bounding and rebounding, if what you were hearing was the music as it was originally recorded, who could say if it was even music, it might just a well has been, have been modulated. Police sirens or distressing those maybe the arrhythmic calculations of an ancient supercomputer. It gave people a sense of communion anyway. It helps them forget the size of the city or else feel the magnitude and its full capacity. Mack was proud that his district set the places he had heard of had invented something like city reflections. He wondered if other places had it to the music, pulsed over the room, cautiously like a vessel signaling. It's approach a port in a low fog, and they allowed that strange melody to fuse it's essence with their own, both of them being so dissatisfied at that moment with the state of being required by human mind.

Speaker 2:          08:33          Molecules mingled with wavelengths were twisted and strewn mislaid shuffled around, transmuted and exchanged, and if afterward only the music remained so what? The drug was in full effect. Mac kept raising the volume because his ears kept adjusting and he wanted it to be loud. What was he trying to death and what? Scab? Light question still itched at him under all that noise? Yes. His secret. Wish for shelly not to answer, he couldn't have been in his right mind. This was exactly what he wanted and being here with her weight on him. Six months of uppers and the knife's edge stress knife's edge stress of [inaudible] card rooms had set a system on a dangerous tempo. What was the motive for going to that whole? He couldn't remember what we didn't want to, but loan end did that to you. It was the kind of place that magnetized it's population.

Speaker 2:          09:25          Even the slightest relaxation of purpose would be enough to persuade an Erin traveler that it was time he ought to go home and it is sometimes said that wherever alone inborn folk go in their lives, no matter the distance or duration, they always die in loan end. Shelly's daughter Lisa awoken by the music that could not be loud enough, trudged into the living room and found her mother completely stoned on the couch with a man of whom she had only the faintest recollection. Lisa knew very little about drugs, but enough to knew, know what it looked like when you were on them. Shelly seeing Lisa and her peach colored pajamas clutching a teddy bear that had been patched and repatch dozens of times, shot up from the couch and tried to act authoritative. Lisa, why are you up? Do you want some water or do you need anything?

Speaker 2:          10:10          I don't mean to yell at you. The music was loud. She said I couldn't sleep. Her eyes were fixed on Mac, who smile, suggested friendliness, but she had been fooled by looks before she chose to distrust him. Haley said, remember me? All she said was, can you turn it down please? And the little girl walked back to her room fainting all the disappointment of a mother. Mac. You asked, turn it down. And he did. Oh, this is a disaster. Why don't I let you ruin everything? Fuck, fuck. She knocked the porcelain jar off the coffee table and the little blue tablet spilled and we're lost in the shaggy fibers of the carpet in that very moment, shelley grave swore off Zena friend to forever. So mortified to what she thought her daughter thought she was. But this was her character's nightly promise. And like the other was never to be kept.

Speaker 2:          11:00          Please go. She whispered and left him there. Instinctively mack went for the tablets that had been strewn in the Sylvan Rug, uh, tasked that prove more difficult than it should have. The drugs still had a strong hold over him now instead of no thought ideas came swarming into his head like beads converging again and again on the same conclusion. My reality is on a loop, never had he felt more sure about something than this. He rewound the day in his head and played it over. He did the same with the previous six months and before repeated occurrences of the same night this night, laid out like sardines in a tin and it all seems so pathetic. The did he have no control over this sad circle of events. He looked down at the handful of blue tablets and new at once that they were the root cause of his problems.

Speaker 2:          11:47          He heard it to the kitchen, desperate to maintain control over his mind before the other part, the stone sucker part could reclaim it. He lifted up the dirty plates in the sink and drop the pills into the disposal. Yes, cut off the supply. Eliminate the opportunity for desire to prey on the weaker self. No indulgence. He exhaled and out came everything bad, overcooked fish wafted from the nearby stovetop. Mac. Wondered again, where did Shelly get fish from? He was sure that she didn't have the money for food. That rare sense memory set off a tiny projector in his head, a tangled dream of gatherings at his uncle Warren's restaurant on catskill street. Birthdays, anniversaries is six. His sister's graduation from the University of Praxis, that dreadful resection after his mother's funeral when he drank too much and actually accidentally told Mr Hoy con that he was fucking his daughter.

Speaker 2:          12:38          She's a tigress bruce. Real rough, but watch out for those nails as Shell Hoy con fired him on the spot only to rehire him a week later, after many apologies and his promise that he would break it off with shelly forever blaring yellow light the sun. No passing district police or was yellow. The municipality detail so fucking hard to keep track. Koten was lawless. Free from that bewildering rainbow of authority. The light there was always the same color, harsh white, raining like a God over octagonal octagonal card tables, concealing the eyes of your opponents and turning the heads of emaciated amateurs like Mac into small, chalky skulls. It was also deliberately organize to throw you off balance by who the hell you knew that going in. At least there you can really lose yourself at least there. You could piss in the streets, whichever authority it was. The light broke.

Speaker 2:          13:33          His trans and Mac was suddenly overcome with a wild hunger. He scraped the burnt leftover fish from the skillet and slapped it onto a dirty plate in the cupboard. There was a bottle of Bourbon. Another odd thing to find at Shelly's. He ate slowly like a beast, staving off the urge to devour it's prize in one great bite. Fish after all was nothing to sneeze at and Bourbon, the life of a king. His uncle love Berman always had a glass with dinner. Maybe she got the gift from Warren, uh, the fish for more and as a gift. But, and the truth was there

Speaker 2:          14:08          on his plate in his glass, mocking him. The clever bitch fish every night if she wanted it, free alcohol all in exchange for turbulent sex and the occasional dose of Xeno. He rushed at the thought of all that full acid skin perspiring, greasy. And what did they say about him in bed afterwards? That he was a joke, making a fool of himself. Could they guess when he'd returned a broken record? That boy he heard it loud and clear in the kitchen. Silence no more. He scrambled into Shelly's bedroom, found her curled up in a ball under the covers and in one vicious motion kicked her from the bed. But the wait was wrong. He felt it immediately to light. The small body crashed into the far wall. At first, the little girl scream came as if from far away and then. And then it was right there, cleaving him into shelly found her daughter strewn on the floor like a ragdoll.

Speaker 2:          15:01          The girl's neck had hit the protruding window sill and this sent her into severe convulsions of bent nerve. Probably appendages thrashed against the pho wood paneling. Quick sonorous studs, Lisa, Lisa, she nailed over her daughter. Completely helpless. You weren't supposed to touch a seizing person, right? She couldn't remember. Mack was in shock. His leg, his legs moved as if by another brain slowly out of the room. His body was taking the necessary steps to extricate itself from the repercussions of this horrible accident and accident. That's what it was. Could he be blamed for it? Really? Images spilled into his head randomly. Uncle Warren drinking bourbon from a perspiring glass. The gruff sniggers have better gambler. Something strange. The strap, the scratch on his mothers coffin. How did it get there? Oh yes, yes. There was a rock hidden in the shovel of dirt. He was supposed to dump over the casket at drew, a line directly above her knees or her shoulders. He couldn't recall what side the head was on, and Lisa twitching like a broken doll.

Speaker 2:          16:04          He found himself in the kitchen again, standing over the sink. Lisa seizure was only a faint tapping in the room. Beyond Dalen the disposal. He could see the small pile of blue tablets. Why had he gotten rid of the Xeno? Think of the money. He was throwing away stupid to throw away all that money. He would need it now. He reached down the tapping ceased silence and then city reflection boomed from the living room. Television. Mac turned around to see who had turned it on, but nobody was there. A contract auto voice called out strange lyrics, the creaking of the tented sky, the ticking of eternity. I saw and heard a new atlast the how and why, of all things past and present and forevermore. The universe, cliff to the core, lay open to my probing sense and augury. That's what it felt like. Had he succeeded in derailing the looping story. Yes. Mac turned around to the sink and was startled to see shelley there standing before him. Her face as cold as the night. I'm sorry, he said or did she say it? Her finger was flushed on a light switch, but he observed no light turn on or off. When he flipped it, moisture on his cheek. Mack looked down to see his hand being torn apart by blades, so swift and sharp that at first he felt no pain and then the pain came and Mac ludgate saw the whole thing.
