Speaker 1:          00:10          The opening of the helm steep battle scene in the two towers reminds me a lot of the opening scene from Sergio Leone once upon a time in the west. Both movies have classic scores, but both use silence and some spare foley sound effects. To set the stage, silence is important because a battle like a shootout is all about contract.

Speaker 1:          00:38          Helm's deep is full of contrasts as a 39 minute sequence. It has to carry the dramatic weight, the ups and downs of a mini movie within a movie to hold our attention. In fact, since the two towers is essentially the middle of a larger story, Peter Jackson and his co writer writers needed the battle to be climactic enough to provide enough temporary closure that the film could stand on its own. In the end, it's that necessity which I think generated the best cinematic battle of the trilogy and one of the best movie battles of all time. You can break the home Steve Battle or the battle of the Hornberger, as it's known in the books into 24 beats. These beats provide a rough layout for the rhythm of the sequence. By the way, speaking of contrast, you can see looking at it this way, that a large part of the battle is virtually monochromatic.

Speaker 1:          01:25          The late great cinematographer Andrew Lesson, he had a really difficult task of maintaining the feel of a night battle and the rain while making sure that the visuals were intelligible enough to the viewer. He does this by infusing the scene with a strong bluish backlight extensively the moon, which draws out edges and by keeping the color palate very limited, he ensures that shots aren't too busy for the eyes and brains of the audience. Intelligibility is really important for a giant set piece like this. Not only do you want the audience to be able to see what's happening, you want them to have a sense of how the fighting is developing for each side, which is why these 24 narrative beats are crucial. Each beat represents an action or development that carries an emotional cue, whether it's the feeling of anticipation at the start or the feeling of vulnerability. When the euro explode, the deepening wall and March up the causeway or the feeling of hope at sunrise, and when Gandalf finally arrives, if you were to graph the progress of the battle using these 24 beats along an axis of how close the heroes were to victory or defeat, it would look something like this. What strikes me right away is that this shape resembles almost exactly a traditional story arc in miniature complete with inciting

Speaker 2:          02:41          incident,

Speaker 1:          02:44          growing obstacles,

Speaker 2:          02:54          mini triumphs,

Speaker 1:          03:06          and a roaring Victoria's climax just when things are at their most.

Speaker 1:          03:15          Steve really is a movie within a movie. It has a fully realized narrative structure that that parallels the narrative shape of the trilogy where things get darker and darker and closer to defeat with some small victories along the way, including home steep itself, but only at the very end when all hope is lost. Does the climactic triumph occur? Having a complete narrative arc like this is how you keep an audience interested in a 39 minute sequence, but to keep them invested, you have to do even more. As I said before, home steep is full of contrasts of close hand, hand fighting contrast with sweeping crane shots, moments of levity, elvish contrast with moments of tragedy, darkness contrasts with light, but with violent, this reckless hate with moral conviction. One of the contrasts that Lord of the rings always has to balance is the one between the real and the mythic.

Speaker 1:          04:15          The film has to be emotionally realistic enough to register on a personal level, but it also has to have that extra heightened element of fantasy, of myth as if we're watching something more perfect than a true story can be. You see that in color Palette like I mentioned, but also in the rain and smoking other atmospherics, the peppered use of slow motion. Of course there are shots like this. It's these things that make the scenes narrative arc three dimensional, Peter Jackson, Andrew, less neat and the crews and actors who spent four months of night shoots filming the sequence, not only made it easily comprehensible for audiences, but also resonate with the rest of the film on the theme of darkness contrasted with light that defines the trilogy. Helm's deep is at once self contained and a critical part of something bigger. In other words, it's not only a masterful sequence helps the is the reason why epic battles.
