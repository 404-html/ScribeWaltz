Speaker 1:          00:00          Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:00          copy on a Tuesday and blog 10. We made it.

Speaker 1:          00:14          Okay, everybody. Let's play.

Speaker 2:          00:22          What the fuck is going on in Europe tonight? Okay, so sovereign debt, also known as government debt is money or credit owed by a central government issue, but it's also known as security. Basically it's like me hitting you a piece of paper and saying, I want to borrow $1,000,000 for you and I'll pay it back in two years. Let's take a look at you. Okay, well dressed, well spoken, good looking.

Speaker 2:          00:45          Okay, I'll do it. I'll give you a million dollars, but only if you pay me back a little bit extra in return, but I thought we were friends. There are no friends in finance, but okay. How much do you want? I want my million back plus three percent. A little bit about. Okay, where do I sign right here? Governments do the same thing. They issue sovereign bonds and accrue sovereign debt. Such bonds are usually referred to as risk free bonds because if the government can pay, all they have to do is raise taxes and print more money. Ice Cream, because governments never ever default on their debt. It's practically unheard of that a government could ever, ever, ever get close to

Speaker 2:          01:17          you. Hold on, I'll get to you first. Let's wind back the clocks. On February seventh, 19, 92 presidents and prime ministers from 12 different European countries assembled mess to read Netherlands design the mess. It was the document that led to the creation of the European Union and the implementation of a single currency called the. To join the EU countries needed to meet strict criteria like no budget. Deficits of more than three percent of GDP. Debt ratios of more than 60 percent of GDP and interest rates on sovereign bonds had to stay within two percent of the EU effort. Remember those numbers on January first 1999, the euro was introduced in nonphysical form. Individual currencies like the German mark or the Greek drama were locked at fixed rates against each other, making that insignificant subdivisions of the Europe. They had to get rid of three years later in 2002, the notes and coins of the yard were printed and distributed and countries started. The process of exchanging all their money for you, why did they do it? Why was the euro create? Well, you see, most of the trade in Europe is among its own country by removing exchange rate risks, cutting the cost of transactions, encouraging firms to trade across international borders. The euro made the euro zone into an area of monetary stability. Data euro is the second most traded currency in the world

Speaker 1:          02:28          behind the dollar.

Speaker 2:          02:32          Through renewed cooperation, Europe sought not only to ensure economic stability, but the international peace and peace they got,

Speaker 3:          02:39          but ha ha,

Speaker 2:          02:46          I thought my jokes were bad in Greece where civilization itself was born, things had been going awry for quite some time after the switch to the euro that traditionally strong Greek public sector, so wages rise to outstanding. Not to mention that the retirement age in Greece was very low and its benefits. Very generous. These things aren't enough to sink a whole country. It was ultimately tax evasion, which did

Speaker 4:          03:08          the coastal suburb of Kubota. He is home to Athens elite an apartment here. It costs more than a million euros, but despite the obvious signs of wealth efficiently, only 16,000 Greeks declared an income of more than 100,000 euros on their taxes last year

Speaker 2:          03:24          when people in businesses don't pay their taxes. It limits revenue. What the country takes. When the money ran out, atkins turned to other European banks for loans. Soon they owed billions of euro and the debt kept going up, but how to grease acquire so much debt when the guidelines of the European Union, we're supposed to keep decks reigned in.

Speaker 5:          03:42          I'm going to make this pencil disappeared. It's hits

Speaker 2:          03:51          in 2010. It was discovered that Greece had paid banks like Goldman Sachs, hundreds of millions of euro and fees for arranging transactions that would hide the actual level of borrowing. This allowed them to keep spending it accrue more debt. Upon the inauguration of George Peppard dre in 2009, the Greek government revealed that it's finances were far worse than anyone expects. Their budget deficit was 12 point seven percent, four times more than the euro zone's limit. The public debt was estimated at $329 billion, 144 percent of GDP and April of 2010. Standard and Poor's decreased Greece's debt rating to the upper levels of junk status. Junk Status Bitch. Take a look at what happened to the interest rates. Have two year box. Holy Shit. Let's go back to that earlier conversation, but I thought we were friends. There are no friends and finding well with the EU. That's not exactly the case.

Speaker 2:          04:40          By adopting the euro, the countries involved basically agreed that they would all be economic friend and when the drunken indulgent little brother passes out in the gutter in the wrong part of town, they're responsible. Older brother has to see that he gets home safe in times of economic emergency countries can usually just print more money and accept the inflation and devalued currency that comes along with it, but the countries in the EU gave up the right to print their own money, so now they have to depend on one and agrees is a relatively small country in the scheme of things. A little economy compared to German, but when Greece owes money, a campaign to Portugal and Portugal owes money, you can't pay to Spain and Spain was when you can't pay to Germany, then a problem arise. It's the domino effect. People fear it ripples through the EU that can hurt comparatively stable countries like France and Germany and even the United States, so Greece needs help to save the euro.

Speaker 2:          05:24          The other countries have ultimately decided to bail out Greece on fifty cents of every dollar that it owes way to soothe. It wasn't cheap. You oughta know you bought it. This in exchange for internal reform in the way of harsh austerity measures, no more early retirement, reduced pay for public workers. Large scale cuts to social programs, higher taxes, and a staggered repayment of the reduced debt. A lot of people in Greece think the austerity measures are too harsh, and so they've incited protests which continue to this day. The problem with the European debt crisis is that Greece isn't the only country in trouble. How much Ireland owed

Speaker 6:          05:58          $865. Billion? Correct. How much does Spain and Italy owed? $1,000,000,000,000 each. Correct who to mainly France, Britain and Germany. Correct. And how Germany, France, and Britain going, Roger will and struggling a bit of a. correct. Why? Because they've been told these vast amounts of money to other European economies that can't possibly pay them back. Correct. So what are they going to do? They're going to have to bail them out. Correct. Where are they getting the money to do that? Roger is a good question. The answer to that one. How much does Portugal? Oh, hang on a minute. What was the answer to that alien? Just keep answering the questions, Roger. So

Speaker 2:          06:36          what is the longterm solution? Most of the bailout money is coming from the European financial stability facilities. Someone to make the efs as a permanent fixture in the EU for whenever a country is. Some had suggested that the weak countries lead the euro's to others, that the eurozone should be dismantled, complete, whatever the solution, whatever money's going to be put on the table, it's all going to be conditional on serious structural reform within the euro. You hate to see a few bad seeds ruined the party for everything.

Speaker 5:          07:01          If we don't deal with this now, soon little at Germany here won't be able to get a nickel for his grandma from the cloud. Let's not blow this out portion. You think you could steal from us and just walk away? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          07:23          Thanks for joining us. That's another edition of what the fuck is going on in Europe.
