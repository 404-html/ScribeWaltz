Speaker 1:          00:01          I think I can sum up the show for you with one word, nothing, nothing. What does that mean? It wasn't until episode three of season four that Seinfeld gave itself that famous description as a show about nothing, not until this episode called the pitch, which mock documents Jerry and Larry David's first meeting with NBC executives. Nothing happens on the shelf, just like life. The interview since then like this, Reddit Ama from 2014, the creators admit that the moniker was only really a joke and that they were actually surprised by how much it caught on with audiences and yet I think the nothing in question is a good lens to examine this show through to explore what makes it different from other sitcoms and so popular still today. And when you think of Seinfeld, the first thing that pops into your head probably isn't 19th century French novelist gustave flow bear, but there's a connection here that I think is worth exploring a little bit.

Speaker 1:          01:11          So you bear was a pioneer of literary realism in large part, responsible for raising the status of the novel to that have a high art so intense with his dedication to craft that in a letter to Luis call a in January 18, 52, he wrote what seems beautiful to me. What I should like to write is a book about nothing, a book dependent on nothing external held together by the internal strength of its style. Now, of course, a novel like Madame bovary isn't literally about nothing. The book explores themes of freedom, love, and Human Stupidity, and explores them deeply the differences that flow bear. Instead of getting at these themes through subject and plot like his predecessors treats them with style. He doesn't just want to string you along with multiple suspense, heightening narrative developments. He wants to bring you into the text itself to look there for the carefully constructed meanings that he's built for you.

Speaker 1:          02:16          So in full bear says he wants to write a book about nothing. What he really means is nothing like the established forms and genres against which he situated himself. Indeed, in any art form, the positive value of a work in question has to be determined against or in negative relation to the other kinds of work already present in the form. By the 19 fifties and number of conventions for the television Sitcom had already been established. Family had become the dominant setting for the situation comedy. These sitcoms feature predominantly white middle class families, sometimes with kids sometimes without dealing comedically with a problem of the week before resolving the issue and coming together into a kind of unity so that they could do the same thing again next week.

Speaker 2:          03:07          We sure are. Come on. Sugar.

Speaker 1:          03:10          What time of the Mary Tyler Moore Show? In the 19 seventies, the nuclear family had been partly supplanted by the family, but the sentimental unity of the group was an even stronger value. Thank you for being my with cheers. In the eighties, Sitcom began to break from. It's by then state conventions. There was less sentimentality, less less than learning and the transition from family as family or family as coworkers to family as friends, and yet still there was a drive toward unity, namely and cheers. The Romantic unity between Sam and Diane, which gave the show a familiar dramatic weight.

Speaker 3:          03:46          Okay, okay. Okay. I got it. You run an antique store and people come into the store and you get involved in their lives. What person who runs an antique store gets involved in people's lives, so someone comes in to buy an old lamp and suddenly I'm getting them out of a jam. Wasn't until

Speaker 1:          04:07          I felt that the conventions of the Sitcom work deconstructed fully when all forms of unity, familial and especially romantic, were whole heartedly abandoned for Seinfeld. These additional elements, we're just so much fluff.

Speaker 3:          04:22          Well, forget the store. They to have a story. He says, you got to have a store

Speaker 1:          04:26          like flow bears, novels. Seinfeld for goes the traditional subject matter of the Sitcom. It's didactic. Sentimentality centered around a family of one kind or another in favor of stories held together by the internal strength of its comedy. Now, this isn't to say that Seinfeld doesn't have plots. It he seinfeld plots are among the most sophisticated of the genre, but the plot drivers are different from it's predecessors. Instead of goal oriented principle characters achieving their ends based on actions that they take. Seinfeld frequently has its characters. Make some small action on a whim at the start of it

Speaker 4:          05:03          episode, certain cast member of melrose place. Really have you ever seen the show know, then spend the rest of the half hour.

Speaker 1:          05:12          We're dealing with the unintended consequences of that action. Kimberly's steel Joe's,

Speaker 3:          05:18          and if they do set out to achieve

Speaker 1:          05:20          a goal, even if they get turned on, they often fail in the end because of circumstances beyond their means.

Speaker 4:          05:27          Can I be expected to have the same expertise as people who own this equipment in Seinfeld?

Speaker 1:          05:34          More complicated narrative. Small events from one character's life can determine outcomes in another. Any action that any character takes has unexpected consequences, so that coincidence, merely a device in traditional goal oriented sitcoms becomes the rule on Seinfeld. That's the guy officer

Speaker 3:          05:56          Larry.

Speaker 1:          05:56          David's no hugs, no learning policy for Seinfeld is in keeping with the show based on refusals, refusal to entertain sentimental endings, real Rome, hence of any kind or the redemptive power of the family. And in doing so, David and Seinfeld rejected the silently agreed upon moral standards that guided every other sitcom to it's weekly resolutions. Again, like madame bovary, Seinfeld isn't literally about nothing, but instead of reinforcing larger moral standards, it explored insanely minute social norms. The women know about shrinkage. What do you mean like laundry? Interestingly, hilariously, it turns out that while the morals of past decades have shifted and changed under our feet, these petty behavioral questions about nothing, all that important proved to be more timeless and timelessly funny than just about everything else.
