Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello and welcome to my second video. This has been pushed back and I'm a blogger now. The reason I'm doing another one, actually it's because I had an idea. Here's my thinking. I'm a nerdfighter and a writer under fighting writer, a nerd writer watch.

Speaker 1:          00:27          That's almost a w. So I am going to answer the Youtube survey, but first I wanted to say congratulations to Maureen Johnson and the name of the star. It's fantastic to get published. Regulations. Boring. I'm going to find your book and buy it. Well, my first kiss was in a tree house when I was nine years old. I was playing truth or dare with a bunch of people and someone dared, a girl named Erica to kiss me and she did and that was my first kiss and I couldn't fucking believe it. Casual clothing, I don't know. Everything I wear is pretty casual. I get most of it from the gap, so probably $60, 99. Really? I didn't know what I wanted to be when I was a kid. I was always told that it would be an engineer. Like my dad. I was always good at science and math, but I never liked him.

Speaker 1:          00:58          I liked history and literature. Eventually I decided I wanted to be a filmmaker. By that time I was already 17 years old. Does that count? I'm really glad you asked about school friends because these are the most important people in my life. I'm a writer so I really could be anywhere in the world, but I choose to be in Los Angeles because my friends are here. That's the reason. It's the only thing in my life that I built that I think is worth preserving. Friendship is certainly something that you built over time. It's work. I love these guys and girls and if they weren't Siberia, that's right. Beat by the girl George. If I had a guy orpheus that will always push and push, that would be a good name to zillow. 500 to answer the survey next, but he's my only subscribers so far. I love Ucla. Thank you so much.
