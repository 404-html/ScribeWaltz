Speaker 1:          00:01          When it comes to retail shopping, statistically there is no day more harmful to your physical wellbeing than black Friday. It's a day that can even be fatal. In 2008 customers broke down the doors at a Walmart in valley stream, New York and an employee was killed in the ensuing stampede. Since then, the occupational safety and Health Administration or Osha has issued safety guidelines for stores wanting to avoid a similar incident and why do people go so crazy on black Friday? It's the deals of course, the deals, the opportunity to get a 32 inch plasma TV for $179. The chance to finish all your Christmas shopping in one go. The super big huge black promises of such Gargantuan savings have traditionally made black Friday the most profitable shopping day of the year. Indeed a number of businesses that operate at a financial loss between January and November, one smart read in ledger books report sales during the holiday season that make the entire year profitable.

Speaker 1:          01:06          Profits by the way, are written in black ink, hence black Friday. I'm about but but, but the only problem is both the name and the savings of black Friday aren't exactly what they see. Let me explain. The first instances of the term black Friday actually have nothing to do with accounting jargon, but with a newsletter from the Philadelphia police department in the 19 sixties. Lamenting the huge crowds, traffic jams in general chaos on the day after thanksgiving. It was not a term of endearment for Philly. Cops knocked by a long shot despite efforts to change the name to big Friday, the term stuck so it was left to marketing executives to put a positive spin on the whole thing and that's how you get the black ink thier and indeed like the name, the promise savings of black Friday are largely an illusion as well and illusion, carefully designed for you the customer to act as irrationally and stupidly as possible.

Speaker 1:          02:00          Big Box stores like Walmart and target and best buy. Don't put everything out for sale on black Friday. Instead, they put out select items as lost leaders. Product sold at or close to a loss for the company to get you in the door. And amongst everything else, they're still selling at a high margin. You've got the TV, but now you need the normally priced wall mount, the normally priced Hcmi cables and the normally priced Roku. Actually, when you look again, you see that the Roku though normally priced comes with a $40 rebate, which you can get back in two months. Not Bad, except for about 60 percent of rebates never get fulfilled because people just forget or they fail to comply with all the print requirements they didn't read when rushing around, best buy in a friends. Indeed, retailers know exactly what it's like to be in a hectic shopping environment and they exploited it to the extreme.

Speaker 1:          02:49          They know that rebates feel good, but people forget. They know that warranty is may seem like peace of mind and the checkout lane, but actually fuel a 15 billion industry of pure profit, pure profit. It feels so good. They know that we shopped by means of rationalization and justification that by putting a super expensive item next to a normally price one will increase the sales of the latter because we don't see price, we see price different. They know everything that this article by economic researchers proved with the help of Mri scans that we are not rational actors when we shop, but that the image of a deal lights up our brain with pleasure like a Christmas tree and that we choose between that pleasure and the pain of spending when deciding on a purchase. Retailers do everything they can to remove the immediate pain of spending, hence rebates in store, credit cards, installment plans and the like, but it's these things often riddled with hidden fees and Hula hoops that ended up killing and eclipsing the savings you thought you were getting in the first place.

Speaker 1:          03:50          As Derek Thompson writes in the Atlantic, the first and last rule of prices is that nobody knows what anything is really worth. Shoppers are guided by shallow clues. This is cheaper than that and latent emotions. It just feels like a good deal rather than knowledge and deliberate thinking, but this isn't just the case for black Friday and increasingly anachronistic term. In a world of Cyber Mondays and Thursdays where Santa is an employee of Ford and Chevy and Mercedes-benz. It's true the whole year round, perhaps in this case the black ink theory is worth keeping in mind. It's the retailers that go into the black on black Friday, not the customers think of it that way and it's easier to see that despite every single ad saying otherwise the day was never really about you. It's about them
