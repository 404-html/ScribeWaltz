Speaker 1:          00:17          Great Wings beating still above the staggering girl, her thighs, caressed by the dark webs her nape, caught in his bill. He holds her helpless breast upon his breast. How can those terrified vague fingers push the feathered glory from her loosening thighs and how can body lead in that white rush but feel the strange heart beating where it lies, a shutter in the loins in genders there, the broken wall, the burning roof and tower and agamemnon dead being so caught up, so mastered by the brute blood of the air. Did she put on his knowledge with his power before the indifferent beak could let her drop later, and the Swan is a sonnet that William Butler yeats wrote and rewrote many times, but finally appeared in this form in his renowned collection called the tower published in 1928 when he was 63. The Tower was the first book of poems he released after becoming a Nobel laureate five years prior.

Speaker 1:          01:34          Gates is of that exceptionally rare breed of artists who improved in quality as he entered his late life. The poem takes it subject from Greek mythology. The story of Zeus, assuming the form of a swan to seduce later wife of the Spartan King [inaudible] who bore from this union, Helen of troy, whose infidelity ignited the Trojan war and the beginning of classical history. Now, before we explore the way yates used the subject to create meaning, just take a quick look at the actual shape of the poem. There's something unsettling about it. The form of the sonnet appears to be hijacked everywhere. It's twisted and torn apart like Dr. Frankenstein Yates has surgically attached the Shakespearean Sonnet with its first two quatrains, featuring an a, a, b, a b rhyme scheme with the Petrarchan sonnet in the last six lines and an efg efg rhyme scheme, including the unnerving slant, Ryan up and drop, which robs the final moment of any auditory closure, most notable of although his line 11, which appears to be slashed and split into leaving the final three lines, just dangling there like late to herself in the indifferent beak of the Swan.

Speaker 1:          02:54          In this way, yates commits a kind of violence on the sonnet form, not for nothing. The poet is attempting to augment the violent content of his work, his sonnets, at least she experienced on it's are traditionally about great love, and yet here yates uses the form to describe what could be considered the exact opposite, an act of violent rape, and if you look at successive versions of later and the Swan, you can see that yates turned up the volume on this violence. For example, in one version, the poem begins, a rush a sudden we'll and hovering still, the bird descends, her frail thighs pressed by the webbed toes, and that all powerful bill has laid her helpless face upon his breast. Now, the early version almost assumes late as acquiescence to the gods advances in the later version beginning with the shock of a sudden blow.

Speaker 1:          03:50          Zeus is molestation, is intensely emphasize and emphasize too is later and the readers disorientation the great wings beating still the ambiguity of beating still. How can wings be still if they're beating? And on the other hand, if he means that they're still beating, that means terrifyingly, that the rape has already begun while the swan is still in the air. Now in this version, the girl is staggering, her thighs caressed a word that disturbs us by comingling, the erotic with the vicious something that Yates does, a bunch of this poem caressed by the dark webs that gives a sense of just how big the bird is because not even the toes, but the webs between the toes are what's caressing her and it should be noted that both the first and second line and with anjem myths pulling us awkwardly through the verse, and it's not until the last line of that first that we finally get the subject.

Speaker 1:          04:51          He as if everything was happening so fast that later couldn't find her bearings until the gruesome act was already underway. The first quatrain of later and the swan is disturbing in the extreme, setting the scene from latest, horrified point of view. Then we have the second quadrant, which is made up of two rhetorical questions, both seem to ask the same thing. What could lay to do against the awesome power of a God? How could she possibly resist? How can she do anything but feel the strange heart beating where it lies? These questions can be read in two ways. You can read them rhetorically, which is to say read them as saying, obviously she can't do anything and such as the tragedy of the poem, but I think Yates invites us to read them literally as well, which is to say what can she do more on that in a moment after the first two verses comes the Volta, a term for when a sonnet turns and the questions or events posed in the first lines are answered in this case, after the shutter, referring both to the moment of ejaculation and latest fear.

Speaker 1:          06:01          We have the poet examining the consequences of the rate and they are really far reaching the broken wall, the burning roof and tower, all intimate that the rape of late at not only caused but insured the eventual destruction of troy and the rise of Greece and western history, a history that was born out of rape, war and murder, and agamemnon dead. Here we have gates own alteration to the mythological history as the story goes, later, laid two eggs, one bore helen and pollux Demi Gods and children of Zeus and the other bore caster and Clayton Nestra, children of latest mortal husband Tim Darrius, who she laid with the same night by citing the death of Agamemnon, famously killed by his wife, Clytemnestra, as among the faded ramifications of the rape. Yates demonstrates the full effect of the trauma and by doing this he reaches into the history of art as well because the calls to troy and agamemnon staff bring to mind respectively.

Speaker 1:          07:06          Homer's Iliad, the pinnacle of the epic form and escalates his play, the Oresteia, the first great work of Western drama. All this is done in 11 words without even mentioning the continued sexual overtones. And then Yates concludes the poem with one final question. Did she put on his knowledge with his power before at the indifferent beak could let her drop and to understand this and the poem itself and its larger context, we have to know a little bit more about yates and his way of thinking from his early life. Yates had always been drawn to mysticism, to astrology and to the occult in Middle Age, he developed his own complex metaphysical and cosmic system, which he laid out in extreme detail in a book called a vision. One of the key ideas was that history was made up into gyres or cycles of about 2000 years, alternating between ages of spirituality and ages of secularism.

Speaker 1:          08:11          Each cycle reached the peak of its excellence in the exact middle than decades, slowly until it was finally replaced by the new one. This idea was explored most potently in his famous poem. The second coming, Yates identified his own time, our time as the end of the religious cycle of Christianity, and envision the start of a new unknown cycle of secularism initiated by the coming of a great beast. The last time such a cycle began is the subject of later and the Swan, the rape of later by Zeus signals the start of the classical era around 2000 BC. In each case, the divine visits, the earth and leaves the seeds of the history that is to come. This is the key to this question. Did she put on his knowledge with his power, did later glimpse the future. She was creating the cycle. She was inaugurating before the indifferent. God flew away in some way.

Speaker 1:          09:11          He suggests the shape of things to come is contained in its origin, but can humans discern it? That's the question. Now, all this stuff about gyres and cycles and mystical systems, it's pretty out there. Clearly it isn't in any way scientific or even very specific. There's a real debate about whether Yates believed any of it probably in some way he did, but what was clearly more important to him was having a unified system in the first place because it was from the many symbols of this unity that Yates was able to extract his strongest poetry. Having that Matrix of sliding meanings to work with so tightly, intricately woven meant that pulling one string, evoking one symbol, laying one idea into the form and meter of a sonnet would make the rest of the web light up like a Christmas tree, signifying a complexity that invites the reader into a number of simultaneous interpretations.

Speaker 1:          10:14          By situating the poem at a fulcrum in history equal to our own, we're forced to look both at what we're coming out of and what we're heading toward. A relevant question for any age, particularly relevant for Yates's own. When the trauma of World War One must have come like a sudden blow by, posing questions if possible, resistance to this brutal act, but showing no resistance on the part of later even possible enjoyment. The readers themselves are called on to imagine how we resist oppression and the nature of resistance itself, both from a feminist point of view and a political one by depicting an encounter with the divine, so savagely we're asked to examine the price of inspiration and by posing questions without giving answers. The knowledge and the power of poetry itself is called into question. All these things are compressed into Yates's later and the swan spring loaded triggered by an image or a tense or upon or a slant. Ryan, that's so much can be packed into 14 lines and 113 words is a testament both to yates and the continuing importance of poetry. All that's left is to pull one string and see what sublime network of meanings lights up.

Speaker 1:          11:45          Hey everybody, thank you so much for watching. I had so much fun putting this video together. I love this poem. I said in the last video that I'm doing the nerd full time now and, and this is the kind of quality of content that I can make with this time and this effort and it's all possible because you guys have been pledging to the channel on Patrion and I want to continue to ask to donate a little bit of your money to this channel because there is so much more that I want to do and I'm so excited for this stuff that's coming up. So as little as a dollar, you can click right here on the screen right now. Everything helps. Thank you again so much. Um, if you want to check out another video, you can see my analysis of in the mood for love, which I did a couple of weeks ago. Great movie. I want to expand the series into a lot of different art forms and mediums. Comics a, even maybe music, TV, lots of cool stuff. I think there's just a lot of opportunity for really awesome stuff and then some stuff that isn't understanding art. It's coming up too, so thank you again and I will see you next time.
