Speaker 1:          00:00          You know, of all the established directors working today, I think the one that would feel most at home in my world, the world of the video essay is Edgar Wright. See basically what I do here every week, like any SAS is make an argument. The difference between me and Say New York Times columnist Paul Krugman, besides a phd in economics and like accolades, is that I use video to make my arguments where he has only language, but even so, our goals are the same. To make a persuasive and engaging argument and just like writers pay close attention to the flow of their words. Carefully crafting the transitions from one idea to the next. I see the rhythm and momentum of my videos as crucial to their effectiveness and here's where I can learn a lot from a garage and I get back to you on the right is a master of rhythm.

Speaker 1:          00:53          What you just saw as one of many extraordinary scene transitions from Scott pilgrim vs the world. It lasts about four and a half seconds, but it's worth taking a second slower look. This transition is all about movement to the right. It kicks off with Anna Kendrick looking to camera, right, which is the direction of the movement, but she's also looking at her brother through the splitscreen. Her splitscreen is key framed off to the left and so is Scott pilgrims, but right as cleverly positioned him left in the frame so we can bring in the unseen right hand part of the shot to extend the Dolly Wipe and the right of that frame is the arm chair which wipes across to reveal the next outdoor setting and the UNIMOG appeal. Letters of the school bell aid. This transition into a shot that continues the motion by actually dollying to the right.

Speaker 1:          01:41          If you were to diagram out this transition, it would look a little like this and it gives you a better sense of just how much care is put into a handful of frames. The transitions are a site of opportunity for Edgar right there. Not only an opportunity for visual jokes as my friend Tony explored briefly in another video, which I'll link to right here. There are a chance to build important connective tissue that brings the viewer through the story. In fact, I think a story is a lot like an argument. It has to be persuasive to work. Scott, he only played one note for that entire song in the beginning of this movie. Scott pilgrim is a drift. The breakup that defined his life for the past year is no longer an excuse for his sour attitude. He begins a relationship with a 17 year old that's clearly not serious to him, and he's kind of just floating through life.

Speaker 1:          02:31          It's a feeling that I'm sure a lot of people are familiar with. I know I am. When everything sort of melts together and you skip around in time from place to place to communicate this feeling right melts together the transitions between settings. He utilizes a few techniques to do this on Scott State with knives for example, there are a series of frame wipes that use diabetic moving objects. Usually people that are so seamless, they momentarily trick the brain into not registering the transition. What's more? These wipes are all accompanied by sound effects, which are also diabetic, whether it's a car, a skateboard, the wrestling of clothes hangers, or the beep of a sliding door all pulling deeper into the world. You also have shots where the reverse shot is matched in framing, but in a totally different location. I mean, this is really cool because right is using the rules of cinema against you.

Speaker 1:          03:26          You're not trained to think that a scene transition could come between a shot reverse shot, so you're already engaging with the next place before you realize that you've left the last one. When you think back on this sequence, it's hard to remember all the locations as distinct, which is exactly what Scott is feeling. I told you like 50 times, party retard all throughout Scott Pilgrim, right? Never misses a chance to use a creative transition, whether it's from scene to scene, Oh hey, it's tonight at the run or within scenes from shot to shot. I think the overall effect of this is two fold. Not only do the wipes and whip pans and match cuts draw you along the story as it unfolds, but they also make you into a more observant viewer. They're transitions that disappeared the first time you watch and stand out the second time or vice versa.

Speaker 1:          04:16          I mean, where exactly is the scene transition here? It's happening completely off screen or rather behind the screen. My guess is either that the house set is on wheels or the bathroom itself is being spun around to face another backdrop, whichever it is. The transition is disorienting in the best way and because what's happening isn't possible. You're encouraged to sort of put the film together and interactivity that's appropriate in a movie about gaming. What's important is that the film goer is involved and engrossed at the same time. This delicate balance is achieved through transitions that are often lyrical, like a kind of visual poetry in the most unlikely place. It might be worth noting too that Scott pilgrim is a story about a transitionary period in the hero's slight for period between knowing who you were and deciding who you're going to be. A life's transitions are harder to navigate than those in film or a video essay, but all of them have to be persuasive and persuasion is about more than the words or the images or the ideas you use. It's also about how you connect. Now.
