Speaker 1:          00:04          Hello and welcome to the nerd writer podcast movie review edition. This is the first podcast that I'm attempting to do. I love podcasts. I love listening to them. I just think there's something special about them. I love audio. I love really great audio love listening to the human voice when it's nice clothes. Nice and close to a really good mic. So I'm going to try a podcast here. I just got out of the movie looper and I want to talk about that today. I'm not going to do percentages. Can do rotten tomatoes for that. Not going to do stars. You can do Roger Ebert for that. I just want to talk about the movie and I think that I do have the qualifications to talk about movies because I was a film student. I know a little bit about what goes into making a movie. I've tried writing short films.

Speaker 1:          00:50          I even tried a getting my hand trying to do a feature a couple of years ago. It didn't work out, but I at least know what it takes, so I have all that. Much more respect for Ryan Johnson, the director of looper and writer who composed this time travel story. Oh, and I want to mention before I start, I haven't read anything about this. I haven't seen any reviews, haven't read any reviews. I don't know what rotten tomatoes even gave it, which is strange for me. I usually always check before I go. I know what some friends have said and the reviews have been in the all in the range of good, some really good, some great, some luke warm, but still mostly positive, so I really enjoyed it. I had a great time watching the movie, the experience of watching. It was a lot of fun.

Speaker 1:          01:36          The first, the first half hour to an hour of the movie I thought was just flawless storytelling really quick. Getting all the information out there that you need. The world that they're living in. Twenty, 44 is explained in the process of the story. Future movies that are set in the future can sometimes get caught up in explaining the world that they're living in. I don't think that looper falls into that trap. I think that the elements of the future, the future technologies that you're showing, the way that the world is, are done as a, as sort of a side glance to the story proper. And I think that the world is very interesting. There's a few sort of technological changes that you see, things that you might expect. Nothing too ridiculous, but also you get the sense that this is a dystopian future. The 20, 44 of this world is something has gone wrong in the period of time in between.

Speaker 1:          02:35          And maybe it's something terrible has gone wrong. They've, I think they make one reference to the vagrant raids of the something. Something so governments or the ability to police whatever city that this story is set in a sort of broken down a little bit. Seems like the crime bosses have control of the town. People are getting shot, you know, out near buses for whatever reason because you know, they're trying to steal something. Um, so it's not a place that you'd maybe want to live unless that is, you were a looper. And I think that the character of the loopers very interesting. And I'm realizing things as I, as I just thinking about this movie, having seen it, which I think is going to happen in the next couple of days, which I, which is a mark of a good movie. One of the things is that these loopers are people who are not really thinking about their future, right?

Speaker 1:          03:29          They go to the same bar every day. They get paid for their job, killing people from the future, and they're doing the same drugs. You know when I was for those, for those of us went to college, I used to call this the haze. You just do the same things over and over again and it felt like frankly a loop right the same night, the same weekend over and over again. You lose track of time. You lose track of yourself. I think that is something that the loopers in this movie are definitely going through, symbolized by the fact that one of the key elements is something called closing the loop where the bosses in the future of somehow deemed it cleaning their own hands of loose ends. They've sent back these kid loopers when they're older, 30 years in the future to kill themselves. You don't know that it's going to be them because they're bagged on the head, but these kids, these loopers don't, they really don't have a future.

Speaker 1:          04:25          They have 30 years and that's it. So there's a layer there. There's a subtext there of are these people's lives anything more than what they do? The montage in the beginning does a lot of that for you. Um, and the way that the drug, for example, this drop in your eyes filmed, it's just really, really stylistic and smart and I think that is something that is shown throughout the whole movie. But moving on. Oh, and I probably should mention there's going to be spoilers in this. So if you haven't seen it, I'd say stop listening right now and go out and see it. It is worth your money to say, so things start to get a little bit more intense, more serious. When Joseph [inaudible] character played by Bruce will lets his future self comes back to the past and they show in a montage of the years intervening what happens to him.

Speaker 1:          05:11          He goes to China, does some more killing, but then eventually falls in love with this Asian woman who he says saves some, saves them from this life. Now there's potentially troubling thing in this to begin with, which is the fact that Joseph Horne Levitt is a murderer. He's murdered people who he doesn't know that they've done something bad. Even if we cited that murdering people was okay. It doesn't know that it doesn't mean bad. He's just taking. He's taking the word of the bosses in the future that they want them dead so he doesn't. It's, it's, it's hard already to sympathize with him in the beginning. That will become much, much harder for the Bruce Willis character later in the movie, but we'll get to that. The main criticism I have with time travel movies and this movie is that depending on what the movie is, you can sort of get a sense.

Speaker 1:          06:02          You get the feeling towards the end that the movie is trying to figure itself out. Time travel. Movies are so much about the writing of them is so much about closing all the loop, the loose ends, making sure that it logical, that it works right, especially ones that are explicitly about time travel, like Lupron. Now of course, you can't close out every loose end with time travel movies. We always take things for granted. For example, we know that it's not logical that only small things would change for the future. Bruce Willis, when little things change in the presence of the movie, when he cuts his arm, we know that little moments in the future affect big consequences or lithium is in the president effect big consequences in the future. The, the, the butterfly effect, the chaos effects. So all of these things being at being at that bar to meet that Asian woman who eventually marries those things don't happen after.

Speaker 1:          06:58          It's a little thing like a, just a small misstep in the, in, in another direction. Um, happens. But we let those things go. And time travel movies, because if we didn't, we wouldn't be able to have time travel movies. It just wouldn't work. Right. I'm back to the future of great time travel movie. The the picture disappearing thing is, you know when, when when their existence becomes questionable, they disappear in the picture. That is ridiculous, but because it's like it goes from the head goes from the head down to the, the, the feet, the last thing that they have. That's just ridiculous, but we let it go because we know that some liberties have to be taken and it's a good example that these two movies are good, are good to compare against each other because the time travel elements in back to the future are very campy to begin with and it's a very campy movie and back to the future spends a lot of time on the character and the story in the past.

Speaker 1:          07:50          Have Marty and the parents and all that stuff. Even though time travel is the wrapping that is all around it. Looper is one of these movies in the line of inception, dark knight, the Chris Nolan type of movies where everything has to be sort of airtight, watertight, right? This is really realistic. This is what would happen. This is how it would be. My main criticism of looper and in that vein is that you feel at the end of the movie, the time travel elements of the story spinning themselves to their proper conclusion, and that for me takes away from the character development, which which for a great movie is always, always the center of the story. I'm not to say that there aren't great characters in this movie. I think that Joseph Gordon Levitt, Bruce Willis a and emily blunt, do great acting jobs for their characters, but there are a few things that sort of go wonky in the third act first, when Bruce Willis kills that kid, whatever sympathy you had for him immediately goes what we know from Ryan Johnson, the director's choice early on, that the fact that he doesn't show Elma, emily blunt's child's face the first three times we see him.

Speaker 1:          08:59          We know that he's the rainmaker. That's something that I don't think he's trying to hide from us. Um, and the fact that we know that means that the first kid that Bruceville's skills is an innocent child, and even though he feels remorse about it afterwards, it's hard for us to sympathize with Bruceville's. Again, I don't know if that's Ryan will ryan or Ryan Johnson's attention for us sympathize, but we don't do it after that. Excuse me. Taking a drink here. And then we have that almost. What essentially is Bruce Willis becomes John mcclane from die hard and starts ripping people apart with machine guns and semiautomatic guns. Just killing scores and scores of people. This guy, his last two are empathetic urges, right? He can't get what he wants. You cannot build a love so strong to justify for the viewer the murder that he commits in the end of that movie.

Speaker 1:          09:56          And, and I, like I said before, it's already hard with Joseph Gordon Levitt character. Oh, and one thing, by the way that I mentioned that I had noticed that I don't think the person who was watching it with notice, um, which I thought was interesting little thing, uh, so the punk kid who's got the Gat, who really shouldn't be allowed to have any kind of gun because he is ridiculous. That's Jeff Daniels from the future, from, from the president. That's Jeff Daniels past self. I think the way that you can tell, the way that I noticed it was when Jeff Daniels died and he's sort of looking at him really sad. The next thing he sees on the wall is the map where Joseph Gordon Levitt is, and there's a circle on the map and I think that is supposed to symbolize closing the loop. So, well done, Ryan Johnson on that. That was a good little moment.

Speaker 1:          10:41          I think I'm reading about that. I could be wrong. So when Joseph Gordon Levitt, kills himself in the end and is able to change the rainmakers future to become it, presumably he's going to become good now. Whatever him. The process, the, the, the moment of him killing himself to me, felt unsatisfying. The reason was because I felt the time travel elements overshadowing the character elements. There had to be an end to this story that worked for eight. A fallen character like Joseph Gordon Levitt, killing yourself is really the only way to go. First of all. So you already have that. Second of all, what happens, you know, Bruce Willis cannot be made to get back with the Asian woman. His wife, Joseph Levitt isn't going to go on to live with emily blunt and the kid. Right? So this is really the only ending of the movie that there could be. And there are a lot of really great movies I should mention that have fallen characters, lowlife characters, but it's broadcast very early on about those characters that they won't make it.

Speaker 1:          11:44          And you know it a good distance from the end. The fact that Ryan Johnson tries to keep us in suspense, like maybe Joseph Gordon Levitt might make it, I think actually takes away from the movie because it would be a sort of. I think it just would be an empty feeling if he got to live. I think that's the trap the movie gets into. It would be an empty feeling for the viewer. If he got to live, it's hard to redeem that kind of character, but he didn't make him a tragic character early on, early enough in the movie. So you're sort of vacillating between the two sides. Will he make it? Well, that's not going to feel great, but he's not telling me that he's not going to make it. So that's really my main criticism of the movie is that the characters are subsumed by the plot elements of making a time travel story work.

Speaker 1:          12:29          All that said, really, really enjoyable movie. I mean, one thing that was fantastic sound editing sound mixing. Wow, amazing. I don't know who did it, but you did a great job and you should be nominated for an Oscar because I thought that the way that the story moved along with sound was brilliant and despite the problems I had with the end of it, it just that that really just precludes it from becoming a great movie from a really, really good movie. So I think that if you haven't seen it, which would be ridiculous at this point because I've spoiled all of it, but if you haven't, go see it, it's worth the money to go. See. That's the review I have of looper. I hope you enjoyed it. Hope it wasn't too long and if you want, if you leave, please leave any comments what you think about this. If you want me to do more of them, it's a lot of fun and I will see you next time.
