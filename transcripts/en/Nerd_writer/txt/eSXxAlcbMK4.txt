Speaker 1:          00:27          The year was 1997. Bill Clinton was sworn in for the second time as US president, the United Kingdom transferred the sovereignty of Hong Kong to China, effectively ending the British empire. Scientists cloned a sheep at the Roslyn institute in Scotland, and Catherine Hettinger, an inventor from Tulsa, Oklahoma, filed a patent in Washington dc for what was then called the spinning toy,

Speaker 1:          00:59          what the world knows now as the fidget spinner was an invention born out of paint in the early nineties, living in Florida, passenger was suffering from my Asthenia, gravis and neuromuscular disease that causes weakness in the skeletal muscles. I couldn't pick up her toys or play with them at all. Hettinger says of her then young daughter, so I started throwing things together with newspaper and tape than other stuff. It wasn't really even prototyping. It was some semblance of something. It wasn't long until that semblance began to take shape. Pittenger flew with her daughter to our nation's capital to patent her new invention with the anticipation perhaps of a gold rush

Speaker 2:          01:43          shopping for the next furby. That was the goal at the sixth annual toy and decoration affair. At the Metro Toronto Convention Center, our own young at heart reporter Brian Hatchell stuff by

Speaker 1:          01:54          say hello to crazy bones. These small plastic figurines come and dozens of shapes and sizes and cost about a buck each. The 19 nineties were of course no stranger to toy crisis, whether it was crazy bones or pugs, furbies or Tamagotchi. Every year the world was once again possessed with a new favorite toy. No one could guess what was going to be next. Toy makers would have paid handsomely to anybody who could, but each time the new craze seemed to sink pointedly with the national character.

Speaker 3:          02:26          What is Jack?

Speaker 1:          02:34          I think there's anything tremendously philosophic about it. I don't think it's any metaphysical. I just think it's

Speaker 3:          02:38          which one to watch. Suck it up and scrub it up with a guy back. Pop it up and pull it up later.

Speaker 1:          02:49          If Catherine hettinger returned from Washington DC with magnificent images of GAC swirling around in her head, who could blame her and for awhile it looked, those gaps soak dreams would become a reality. The mammoth toy company, Hasbro agreed to test headend jurors finger spinners. Unfortunately, in the end they decided not to move forward with the production and some things that should not have been forgotten or lost. History became legend. Legend became myth, and for two decades the spinning toy passed out of all knowledge until when chance came, it ensnared a new generation.

Speaker 4:          03:37          They are popping up more and more in schools and stores are really having a hard time keeping them on the shelves. I'm talking about fidget spinners or fidget spinners. We'll call them fidget spinners, fidget widgets or whatever you'd like.

Speaker 1:          03:50          Fidget, spinner, fidget spinners is caught a fidget spinner. My daughter has one. You just kind of put on your finger and spin it around like this though. No one can say when exactly the fidget spinner came to America. In late 2016 reality TV star, Donald trump had been elected. The 45th president of the United States. All cell phones had lost physical buttons in favor of touchscreens and two brothers, mark and Matthew Mclaughlin had just unexpectedly raised $6,000,000 for a trinket called the fidget cube, which a great story. It's a human story. It's a story of those who went first. They were first. They led the way they opened the trail. It's obvious to everyone that the fidget cube is fun. I mean just look at it, but it was much more than that. Citing a study from the Australian Journal of learning difficulties. A claim was made that these game changing toys could actually help those afflicted with Adhd to focus better, engaging in fine motor activity. The study said may assist students with Adhd in resisting the pool of distraction and then two days before Christmas fidget spinners dormant for almost two decades, except in certain underground fidget circles exploded like lightening onto the scene.

Speaker 1:          05:24          It's more exciting than than this makes it seem these days

Speaker 5:          05:27          fidget spinners are everywhere. They're in office cubicles and playgrounds in hospitals and locker rooms. Even in the White House, everything must be perfectly done and they weren't working in a production line and you have to get so many pieces done per hour, but it all had to be perfectly done and it does extend to you as you look at it, the sense of serenity

Speaker 1:          05:50          for months. The spinner is medical benefits were hotly contested by news websites with nothing better to do. Apparently they were banned from classrooms across the globe. You could find them everywhere and nowhere. And what about Catherine Hettinger? That of course is the great tragedy of this story in 2005 and the long dark calm before the fidget store, Hettinger was forced to let her patent expire because she couldn't afford $400 renewal fee. Since then, the inventor of the fidget spinner hasn't seen a dime of the prophets of the most successful product of all time.

Speaker 6:          06:29          Anything really new in thought and material life has to have its source in something you have to go spiritual. Nobody can be really creative and unless there's something spiritual behind it, whether you, whether it's goes by that name or not, I mean who invented the house, who invented any of the things? We have probably someone engaged in some kind of search.
