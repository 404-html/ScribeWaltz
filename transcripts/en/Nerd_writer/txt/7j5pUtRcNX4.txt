Speaker 1:          00:12          Edward hopper is a special artist for a lot of us. I've always thought of him in a sort of romantic way because his paintings evoke the same kind of feelings and memories in me that I get from the sense of smell is if he was channeling directly into my limbic system, excavating moments that were stored deeply away, a stubborn realist throughout the mini changing and often abstract currents of modern art in the early and mid 20th century. His canvases are clean, smooth, and almost too real, not real like his contemporary Andrew Wyeth, for example, who strive for detail and photo realism, but pulled back by one degree into depictions, slightly more generalized, slightly more detached from place history and person in this way. There's just enough room to put your own life into hopper's work, but once inside, it's impossible not to be closed in and see that life along his themes.

Speaker 1:          01:11          Nearly all those themes are present in nighthawks. Unquestionably the artists, most famous work themes of loneliness, alienation, voyeurism, quiet contemplation, and more. The scene depicts for people in New York City diner at night. It's meant to be somewhere in Greenwich village where hopper lived, but decades of exhaustive searching have concluded that it was never a real place. There was one waiter and three patrons who is relationships are all ambiguous, seated so close together in an empty diner at night. It's likely that these two know each other somehow, but though their hands overlap, they don't touch and they're in different phases suggest that they could be strangers if not just momentarily estranged. The main character of the piece seems to be the diner itself and island of light in the outer darkness. It's diagonal lines are strong accentuated by the counter and the stools and we're seeing the diner at an odd angle as if from the vantage of someone crossing the street, it's triangular corner juts into the frame like the prow of a boat, and this is no coincidence.

Speaker 1:          02:14          Not only was hopper obsessed with the imagery of boats, but he repeatedly situated his buildings at angles like this and the point of that I think was to achieve and effect in which his subjects were both behind and in front of windows. Of course, windows are the place where the separation between outside and inside becomes complicated and not because we can physically move through them, but because our site does, because our gaze invades these private worlds. Indeed in hopper's work, the windows often appear as if they're not even there as opposed to someone like Norman Rockwell who had a talent for giving glass, a texture hoppers windows vanish. They invite that voyeuristic look, knowing that houses like people can be penetrated with a gaze. Copper was a very slow, very deliberate painter. He took months to finish a canvas and made several sketches and studies before embarking on the final piece in these sketches for Nighthawks, we can see hopper out on the street looking for the right back angle for this man modifying to find the perfect effect.

Speaker 1:          03:20          Here's his sketches of Josephine, his wife, who modeled for the woman in the painting. Here's her right hand holding a cigarette, which he eventually transplanted to her partner hopper, wanted his devotion to each work to be mirrored by our appreciation as slowly and deliberately as he painted. He wanted us to look really look to be made vulnerable as a viewer, always is whether he or she is crouching in the dark and the building opposite or simply crossing the street. There's no door to the diner and nighthawks, no way in except by way of site. That site enters the fluorescent light of the establishment, passes through the three patrons in there on wheat and loneliness and exits into the dark for bidding night behind them. You know I, I wonder about that. Darkness hopper tried very hard to on more his work from the historical moment.

Speaker 1:          04:13          You didn't want only to be judged in the context of his time and place, but it's worth noting that this painting was completed in the weeks and days following the bombing of Pearl Harbor when everyone in New York City was paranoid about another attack, the city held blackout drills a way to practice hiding the city in darkness. If an aerial assault ever came, but hopper didn't care, his studio lights stayed on. As his wife wrote in her diary, ed refuses to take any interest in the very likely prospect of being bombed. This was the atmosphere in which night hawks was Ford. Did it have an influence on the painting? I don't know. The future was very uncertain at this moment in time, as uncertain as the darkness that frames the patrons of the Steiner, a darkness there launched into by hoppers composition and our gaze. The artist was obsessed with light, how it fell on houses, on people through windows.

Speaker 1:          05:09          The colors that made hopper seemed to disregard the chaos in the world around him, but is it a coincidence that like his studio, the light of the nighthawk, Steiner seems to be the last light still shining in the city, and for this reason, I think you can find a slightly more optimistic reading of this painting. What is there to do in the face of great disquiet and doubt, but work and live on all the poppers. People seem to be huddled up against the present moment. Lonely. Yes. Waiting maybe a little board people have nighthawks are no different, but boredom is exactly when we feel time and being the most acutely. It can inspire a profound mood. Maybe that's what these people are feeling alone together in their lighted ship, sailing against the darkness of all that was yet to come. The yellowish greenish fluorescent light in this scene like the light and hopper studio is a meager substitute for the brilliance of the sun, but it can through giant windows still illuminated the world. Hey everybody. Thanks for watching. Nighthawks is one of my favorite paintings ever. So that was just a lot of fun to make. So two big announcements. One, we are about to hit 100,000 subscribers on the nerd writer channel. It might be at 100,000 by the time this video goes out.

Speaker 2:          06:38          Ah,

Speaker 1:          06:40          that's amazing. I've been doing this for over four years and it's been amazing and fun and exciting and fascinating from the very start. So thank you to everyone who's been with me from the beginning, who's come on recently and everything in between. Um, the nerdwriter is, it's, you know, it's my profession, that's my career and it's everything that I want to do. So there's gonna be a lot more of it. The other big news is that we crossed the thousand dollars on the Patriot on this week, uh, and I just have to thank you so much for that. Um, you know, we're right at the beginning now of what's making this financially feasible for me. So thank you for pledging on patron to the nerd writer if you haven't already, I'd love for you to pledge to this project, um, and help me keep making these videos because there is so much more stuff that I want to do more painting analysis and film analysis and understanding art. But a lot of other cool stuff too. Um, that will be coming your way soon. So thank you again and I will see you guys next Wednesday.
