Speaker 1:          00:01          Why not a Tuesday evening and block 20?

Speaker 1:          00:16          Hello and welcome to the nerd writer after dark, the only place in the big black ether to hear about the sexy side of high finance. My name is the nerd writer and I'm here to be your guide through the titillating seas of fiscal irresponsibility, helping you in any way I can take it your assets in order, out of order, whatever suits your financial fancy, and I'm joined as always by my cohost, the very mysterious original circumstance. How you doing tonight, Reggie? Just fine. What's that? You got there? Read this. My friend is a 78 Marillo by foreign Yantais, the same urine vintage drunk by the senior associates at the blackstone group. The same year they acquired the Howard Johnson Franchise in 1990. Wow. That is vintage. I'm actually drinking a very special bottle myself here. Read this is an 89 Pino noir by wooden head sent over by the board of Bain capital.

Speaker 1:          01:08          This vintage they drank when staples inc. One of their very first investments went public and it's also the wind that they were drunk off of their gourds on when this picture was taken. TOnight I want to talk about one of the sexiest figures in the nation. If not the world. I think you know who I mean and no, I'm not talking about beyonce or mr. Circumstance over there. This is a man with both public sector and private sector experience. you guessed it. I am talking about the one the only, the irresistibly erotic, mitt romney. Mr romney is currently in contention for the republican presidential nominee touted by many as the front runner in that race, though a week turn out in South Carolina has many predicting that this might become a stripped to the waist mud wrestling match between mit and the improbably. New bile newt gingrich.

Speaker 1:          01:54          Ladies I know I'm not the only one who wants to see these two sands shirt, but politics is the bag of a different show here. We are more interested in what mr romney did before he set his sights on the oval office and since the man himself puts his experience at bain capital at the forefront of his campaign, I think it's only appropriate that we explain and analyze that experience. What do you think, reggie? I think I'm drunk now. Those who know me know that there are a few things that make my cherries tingle more intensely than private equity, but what is private equity after all? Well, private equity isn't asset class consisting of equity securities in operating companies, not publicly traded on a stock exchange. Well, nerdwriter. Hey, that sounds like a lot of gobbledygook to me. Okay. Reggie, I think I. I think I get your point here.

Speaker 1:          02:36          So private equity or pe used to be called leveraged buyout or lbo. It's the practice by which a private equity firm like bain capital uses a fund of money to buy out a small or underperforming company to flip it for profit. It's like flip that house. You've seen that show? I love that show. Okay, so let's say that you have a company that you want to sell, and I'm a private equity firm. Now the price you put on your business is, let's say $10. What I'm going to do is raise 1 million through my investors. That's the equity. The other 9 million I'm going to borrow from the bank. That's the leverage. Okay, so now that I have the 10 million, I'm going to buy out your company with $9,000,000 in debt in come in and try to streamline all the aspects of that business, going to make things more efficient. The layoff, unproductive. Employees decrease overhead after five years. Let's say that I succeeded and now your business is worth 20 million. What I'm going to do is pay back the bank, gets 9 million plus interest and then split the rest between myself and the investors. This is the basic model of a leveraged buyout. How's that?

Speaker 1:          03:41          So it looks like we have our first caller here. Hello, you're on with the nerd writer. What is your question?

Speaker 2:          03:48          I'm a long time and they love your show. Thank you. private equity is good or bad for the economy seats. I think I won't be able to run this building from the ground reconsidering how, but I don't like to know what impact is. Industry as well.

Speaker 1:          04:04          That's a great question, mary, and a tough one. See these days, romney presents himself as a job creator recently saying we started a number of businesses for in particular created a hundred and 20,000 jobs as of today and there's no doubt that private equity, especially venture capitalism and arm of private equity firms invest in startup companies, can create jobs, especially if you make a good bet like romney and bain capital did with an idea for supermarket of office supplies which later became staples. The problem is that streamlining cutting the fat can often mean job losses and If the investment goes sour, well everybody loses. Even you married since your accountant has invested some of your own funding. the deal, I'll hark capitalists like romney say that this is unnecessary risk of the system and maybe it is, but the problem with the term job creators is that job creating is never the intended function of any of these private equity firms. The purpose of bain taken directly from its website is to deliver industry leading returns for its investors to deliver the best returns. Job creation and job loss are a byproduct, and this brings me to my central point.

Speaker 1:          05:18          It was romney and his peers at the inception of a revolutionary new industry called leveraged buyout or private equity, who helped to redefine american business. See these men, a schism between the incentives of a company's owners, otherwise known as shareholders and the incentives of its management. To rectify this, they acquired the companies themselves via leveraged buyout, manage them themselves, and gave existing management and equity stake in the company in the form of stock or stock options. This is the beginning of huge executive compensation which gets the goat of those occupy protesters. The revolution is more clearly stated as the total alignment in the incentives of accompanies owners, its board, and its management around stock holder value.

I'm afraid that's all the time we have tonight on the nerd writer after dark. I do want to remind everyone that ridge is a fine guitar player and he does do all bar mitzvahs, weddings, and corporate functions. I want to wish you all a good night. I made your stocks rise in the morning and may your competitors go utterly bankrupt.

Speaker 3:          06:37          Hello, issue a merry christmas. Merry christmas. Merry christmas from the bottom of my.
