Speaker 1:          00:12          Coffee on a Tuesday and blog 21.

Speaker 1:          00:25          So I have this thing about bookstores whenever I walked by them. It's sort of like, you know how in Vegas they pump scented air through the casinos to make the gamblers feel good. Well, whenever I walked by a bookstore, I get the smell of books in my face and I just have to go in and I could spend all day in there. The reason I usually leave is because I start to get light headed and realize that I'd miss lunch and it's coming up on dinner and people are expecting me and I have to do this thing and write that email and move on with my day. And maybe it's not smart for one to analyze the charm of bookstores. But. Well, I've already sort of started it and anyway, I read this article in the Times yesterday and and it's got me thinking about it.

Speaker 1:          01:00          See the article said that Barnes and noble has predicted that in the coming year it will lose more money than even Wall Street had predicted it would. And this after the bankruptcy and disillusion of borders, its main competitor is the specter of ebooks with Amazon and it's kindle as a dominant force, threatens to diminish this, this last chain of booksellers, and if they do, you might be left buying your your best sellers at places like target or Walmart. And it's ironic because it was barnes and noble, which drove so many independent booksellers to bankruptcy, sort of like what Tom Hanks does to Meg Ryan and you've got mail

Speaker 2:          01:36          with his multilevel, homogenize the world Mochaccino land. Now

Speaker 1:          01:40          mochaccino land might be the last best hope for print books and publishers like penguin and Random House and Simon and Schuster who used that front of the store display table to premier new talent to push the next big thing at table, which is especially important for new writers like me now to fight off the kindle. Barnes and noble has the nook and it has boosted some revenue to the company though it's hard to fight off both Amazon and apple at the same time. David had enough trouble fighting just the one goliath. William Lynch, the new CEO of Barnes and noble has done everything he possibly can to stay relevant and ahead of the curve, but his company is worth this much while Amazon's is worth this much and I guess we'll see how it plays out, but I pause to wonder if there is something lost by the digitizing of books in the possible end of bookstores.

Speaker 1:          02:27          It's safe to say that someone reading a book on their kindle or Nook is having an experience which is negligibly different from reading a paper book. The story is still there. The words arrange as they are still produced, the same magic, the same music of mental images that only pros can make that won't be lost. I guess what I fear is not the death of stories, but rather the end of the physical space, which those stories take up walking through the stacks and shelves of the bookstore. All our past and present knowledge looms cast shadows on you and maybe you get more accurate of sense with all that papered space of the distance. We've come as a thinking rice. It's like a real living interactive timeline. It's not the same with a selection of ebooks on your ipad. It's no space, they're just scrolling. You can't see each and every page tight against the next and you can't see the overstock or the display table or the books people have taken out of their shells but decided not to buy. So there's a million variables in the bookstore variable stretched over space and time, and it's true that sometimes a book like a magic rain can find you

Speaker 1:          03:32          and maybe there's an alchemy in that, which would be a shame to lose. Or maybe I'm just being sentimental.
