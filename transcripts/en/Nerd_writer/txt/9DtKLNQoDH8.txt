We're going to go through them for my helper. For this video. We're going to use my sister, Sydney, the lovely Sydney Boucek. You can call her the kidney and uh, yeah. So coffee on a Tuesday and 52. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:32          Alright. You guys asked a lot of great questions here. Um, we're going to go through a couple of them are going to answer as many as we can, as quickly as we can and hopefully we can get through as many as possible. Who is your favorite philosopher and why? Albert [inaudible]. Albert can move the myth, the myth of sisyphus and the rebel. Those are the two that really have influenced me. The most name, some not so popular youtube channels that you would recommend. Well, I have one chip. So popular.

Speaker 1:          01:18          is your favorite book you've read in the past year. The fault in our stars. Any advice for someone who is, for lack of a better term, still searching for what they love.

Speaker 3:          01:26          I think that if people have a passion for something that may not, for example, writing that's not going to pay the bills, that they just, they don't do it. It might not pay the bills that might not pay the bills. They don't do it. And then they just go for the job. That's gonna pay the bills. So

Speaker 1:          01:45          yeah, I think there's a lot of hobbies that you get that you think that, that you just sort of enjoy. You think you could never turn it into a career just because of the way that you were raised with the way that you think. Everything that you do that you love can be turned into a career if you do it creatively. Enough of the ancient Greek philosophers who was the most awesome and why Plato, because he was the best writer. How is your brain the way your mind works and your worldview different now than when you were 18?

Speaker 1:          02:13          Because now you're 24. I think the big difference between the difference I think is that now I am willing to be wrong, to make someone happy, whereas when I was 18, I was obsessed with being right and the truth. So true. So now I think the best thing that you can do, you are. You always had to be right. The best thing that you can do and learn, the hardest thing to learn is that sometimes it's right to be wrong. If it makes the other person happy. Were you afraid of moving out on your own and was it an easy adjustment? No, God, I wanted to move out so bad when I came to college. Portland, Oregon.

They also many of met each other. There's so many people in the world. They put God really put the puzzle pieces close together. Yeah. Advice for college, freshmen and aspiring writers. Okay. Here's my advice for aspiring writers. Learn how to deal with hating yourself. Writing. That's great advice. Writing in the first weeks and months is going to be a lot of hating yourself. Probably six out of the seven days that you write. If you write all week, you'll hate yourself. That number will slowly shrink over time and what you can do is really look forward to the days when you think your writing is good, but you're always going to have those days when you think your writing is terrible and a lot of what stops writers once they start is not being able to get through those periods of days when what you, what you think you write is really shit because it is really shit.

Speaker 1:          06:33          In the beginning you should get a second opinion. What did you think? Your writing is really good, but it's really not that good. I always get a second opinion. Would you rather fight one horse sized duck or 100 duck sized horses? I think the answer is obvious. One weight, one horse sized duck, or 100 duck sized horses. 100 ducks side is. I think there's no. There's no argument about this. It's 100 duck sized horses because you just mow them down, right? Because you say you take a, you take a golf club and was just fucking mow them down.

Speaker 5:          07:06          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          07:09          Sorry. It will be terrifying to face the duct size horse or no, it'd be terrifying to face a horse sized stuck. Think about this. A horse. A horse sized. Yeah. This is, that's what it's doing. What is the bravest thing you've ever done? The bravest thing I ever did was tell my friends that I love them. Why do you have to make everything sound dramatic? Like there was always some deeper meaning to it when there is. So actually the bid, they were staying in these me to do it. Thanks so much for the [inaudible], for joining us for this.
