Speaker 1:          00:00          Homeland Security bill is ratified after eight years. British borders. It will remain closed. The deportation of illegal immigrants will continue. Good morning our lead story.

Speaker 2:          00:10          The world was stunned today by the desert, Diego, Ricardo, the youngest person on the planet, maybe Diego was stabbed outside of bar and what? Osiris.

Speaker 1:          00:20          Here we are, first of all, funds will Korans. Children of men is a shot of an audience getting information about the state of things in the same way that we do through the media. You may have missed it, but Korans fundamental motif of contrasting foreground and background has already been established through the media before this shot even begins. Let's back up on the deportation of illegal immigrants will continue. Good morning our lead story like everyone else. The media prioritizes information based on its values. So much attention is paid to the foreground to the lead story that the background can go by without much notice. The lead story of children of men is the story of feel in a future world nearing its end, because women have lost the ability to have children. Theo and apathetic government bureaucrat returns to his roots as a political activist after he sees that there is still hope left for humanity.

Speaker 1:          01:24          The film plays as an exciting action thriller, as Leo helps the pregnant key get to safety with the human project, but as the plot moves along it's linear path. Following Theo, the camera repeatedly becomes preoccupied with what's going on in the background, and this is a technique that Koran has used in the past and it makes for an interesting effect. As in thousands of other films we experienced the world through the eyes of the main character. This process of identification is automatic and strong, so strong that we can even be made to sympathize with people who we would otherwise identify as bad or evil. So when the camera actively breaks that identification and shows us imagery, the lead character doesn't see or notice were made forcefully aware in a purely visual way of the perspective of the film itself. In children of men. That perspective is absorbed by the background, by a bleak great winter break.

Speaker 1:          02:24          The only country in the world still under stable government control. This background scene always at a side angle probes and investigates the conditions of that stability and whether or not it's worth what sacrificed to have it, though it's dressed up with the few futuristic flourishes the World Koran presents to us is a reflection of our own. The grim combination of nationalistic, xenophobic politics and late capitalist consumerism isn't something that we have to imagine when Mexico sends its people, they're not sending best. They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime. They're rapists. In 2006. When this film was made only five years after nine slash 11, and at the height of the war on terror, this was, and in many ways still is the state of things. Thousands of migrants and refugees from the war torn and Middle East and Africa. A rude awakening awaits in countries that are moving to close their doors.

Speaker 1:          03:21          And there's another background to a figurative background of cultural reference. For example, when key first reveals her pregnancy, she stands in a posture reminiscent of Botticelli's birth of Venus. One of the many references in this film to maternity, Jasper and Miriam both recite, teach. We're calling both the pawnee shots and ts Elliot's the wasteland, which is a major source of inspiration for an infertile world that's lost its way outside Theo's cousins, arc of arts. A pig floats above the old battersea power station and overt reference to pink floyd's album animals. A concept album loosely based on George Orwell's animal farm itself, a satirical indictment of authoritarian socialism or Stalinism. Indeed, there's a lot included in the arc of art scene. Here's a banksy. Here's Michelangelo's David, because those guarantee TCA significantly framing theo in the realities of war and underneath it all plays King Crimson's, progressive rock anthem to the court of the Crimson King, blending the sacred and the profane, but Korans referencing becomes more potent as the inter texts layer and connect.

Speaker 1:          04:36          Take this shot here at utilizes nearly all the techniques I've mentioned so far. You have the lead story moving again towards its destination at the sea, but the camera, it leaves them for a moment to focus on this mother, cradling her dead son. The most immediate citation here is to Michelangelo's famous sculpture, La, PA, Ta, which Nigel mentioned earlier in the film. Good luck top smashed up before we got back, and that sculpture at Mary holds the crucified Jesus in her arms, questioning the cruelty of men. The image also evokes guernica also shown earlier in the film a much more modern meditation on the horrors of war, and Oran has said in interviews that the inspiration for this image came from a photograph out of the Balkan wars itself, a referenced to Michelangelo's work, whereas the arc of arts shows are extracted in, placed in an ivory tower. Koran puts art back on the ground where it belongs and brings it alive within a number of contexts, ancient and current, and most importantly as a background for the main story, there is an absurd paradox that sits at the center of our modern world.

Speaker 1:          05:48          While capital itself knows no borders, people and nations struggling to find their identities have sought repeatedly to tighten their borders and restrict people's from crossing them. What's more, these refugees are increasingly displaced by the militaristic medley of neoconservative regimes and the worsening climate, a result of the unchecked expansion of capitalists enterprises in children of men as in our own world. All of these things are intimately connected and yet for each of us individually, it's hard to see anything but the foreground, the lead story. That's why the roving curious preoccupations of Koran's camera are more than just a site. By providing a disinterested break from identification, they achieved something. We just can't in our own lives. They let us see the world bear naked, stripped for a moment of subjectivity. This is the radical political potential of cinema. We can all keep to our main stories. If we want little worlds, sooner or later, the background is going to come from. Wow,
