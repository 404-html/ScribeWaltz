Speaker 1:          00:05          One of my favorite comics, masterpiece mouse, comes in the very first chapter here. The comic, if you don't know, is about spiegelman's father's experience in the Holocaust. More specifically, it's about spiegelman's own efforts to come to grips with that experience while navigating a really strained relationship with his dad. Mouse is obsessed with this correspondence between the past and the present and it's a theme that Spiegelman is determined to workout visually in his comic. How does he do that? Well, let's take a look at the page that I mentioned earlier. Panel by panel in the first spiegelman's. Father Vladik takes his grown son already backup to his old bedroom after dinner so that he can do some exercise already. The past is signaled here with the empty bedroom. Have a child that's moved out in the second panel. We get a closer look at that room and what Vlad ics done with it. More remnants of the past, like the pennant banner from Spiegelman's College Harper, where he studied art and philosophy.

Speaker 1:          01:01          We get our first glimpse of the exercycle that Vladik uses to work out, and this is where art broaches, the subject of the book that we're reading now, notice that the body's of both father and son are leaning at the same angle, spiegelman's asking his dad to open up so he parallels his body language. He's also equating these two men visually and the book will continue to compare and contrast them until the end. In the third panel, the heads are parallel this time arts looking at a picture, but we won't learn what it is until a few panels down and the fourth panel, nothing changes, but art's head which swivels around to his father as he makes his request explicit, and then we come to the fifth panel which stretches the entire width of the page. It has a lot going on right away. You can see three key signifiers of the past, the picture, the identification, Tattoo Vladik received outfits and the speech bubble where Vladik says it would take many books my life and no one wants anyway to hear such stories as critic Hillary Chute notes.

Speaker 1:          01:58          It's as if the past articulated, inscribed in documented were flanking both men closing in on them, and of course within this rd is enclosed by his father. In the six panel, we learned that the photograph is of already mother on Joe, which helps us understand the panels that came before. In the seventh panel, we see Vladik shoe peddling with effort on the bike, but going nowhere. Then in the eighth and final circular panel, we get our first window into the past, into the story within a story that will consume the book. The different shape signals, a new narrative thread. While the image of latic echoes the photograph that's been a dominant feature of the rest of the page

Speaker 2:          02:39          and a comic. You have various panels. Those panels are each units of time. You see them simultaneously, so you have various moments in time simultaneously made present.

Speaker 1:          02:49          That's art spiegelman explaining why it's a bit unfair to do what I just did and considered the value of a panel on its own. For spiegelman, the basic unit of comics is the page, its basic function, that interplay of moments that happens when you take in several panels all at once in a way that's unique to comics. Time is made spatial spread out across a surface so that you can see not only how the past affects the future, but vice versa. What you learn here, that this picture is of art's Mom, white ex wife who committed suicide, transforms the meaning of this look here and all it takes is a glance, the slightest movement in the eyes to access that connection. You don't need to rewind or read back or start over again on the page. Those two moments exist simultaneously. In this sense, graphic design becomes a vital part of comic making.

Speaker 1:          03:39          As the Great Cartoonist Seth Aka Gregory Golan once said, the words and pictures that make up the comics language are often described as pros and illustration combined a bad metaphor. Poetry and graphic design seems more apt. Poetry for the rhythm and condensing graphic design because cartooning is more about moving shapes around designing than it is about drawing. This page of mouse is the perfect illustration of that sentiment and take a closer look. What do you see in this design? What about now in Spiegelman's book and life? His father is a towering figure, is experience surviving. The most horrifying event in history becomes the central fact and not just his life but in his sons and that's how the trauma of the Holocaust invaded the world and how the past invades the present in mouse Vladik literally invades the page and pumping away on his exercycle as shoot points out already. His father is literally unable to move forward, which is why it makes sense that the past begins in the wheel.

Speaker 1:          04:42          If that blank art spiegelman set out to create a comic that would be readable, that's why he spent 13 years writing, drawing and designing mouse. Every page is a new pattern to pick apart. A new configuration of moments passed and president words and images. Father and son. This attention to design is why mouse is often regarded as the best graphic novel ever written. It's not that the subject matter is inherently dramatic and effecting which it is. It's that spiegelman wanted to tell a story in a way that was unique to the comics medium though to extract the truth of the Holocaust and I'll just family that only comics could tell.

Here's another page I really love for the way that it plays with how a comics page is normally read. It's the point in the story when black is first entering Auschwitz. Now everyone who reads comics knows that you're meant to go left to right, then down, then left, right again, but here spiegelman cleverly uses overlapping speech bubbles to pull you down the left side, and at that point you have to read down again and that becomes a descent into the beast. Small, horrifying, but beautiful. Anyway, see you guys.
