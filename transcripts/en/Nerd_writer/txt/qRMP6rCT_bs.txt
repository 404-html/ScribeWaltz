Speaker 1:          00:02          So I was reading a fascinating asked science on Reddit the other day. Someone wanted to know what was happening in their mind when five apples were dropped on the floor and they were asked to count them where they just counting quickly or did they remember what five things look like in response? Reddit user surf, Kate tindle gave a great concise explanation of the difference between counting and something called subitize. Coming from the Latin subcutis meaning sudden subitizing refers to our brain's ability to suddenly recognize objects up to about four, which means that if you see, for example, one, two, three, or four pizza johns, you don't have to spend any time looking at each individual pizza. John, you just know how many pizza johns there, but if you increase that number by even a little more, your mind loses the ability to grasp what it's looking at right away.

Speaker 1:          00:55          Indeed, the time it takes to make a judgment on number's larger than four increases by about 250 to 350 milliseconds with each consecutive number. That's because when you move out of the subitizing range, you actually have to look at each individual item and count them up. The way we do this is by taking the list of numbers, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, and so on, and assigning them to the pizza johns in ascending order. When we reached the end of our set, whatever number we stopped on is the number of items there are digging a little deeper. This process of counting as we know it involves five criteria that was a little bit corny. First, the one to one principal, meaning that each object can only have one tag or number name, second or Dunalley meeting, that the tags must be applied in the same order every time.

Speaker 1:          01:47          One, two, three, four, not three, two, one, four, five, eight, nine, Omega Jackson pollock, third, the cardinal principle or cardinality, which I mentioned before, meaning that the last tag always represents the absolute quantity of the set forth the order irrelevance, which means that it doesn't matter. It's irrelevant which order, the objects are counted. The number will always be the same. And finally fifth, the abstraction principle, or the ability to apply counting to a number of varied objects, not just the same one, used multiple times, counting in this way, extrapolated allows us to deal with very large numbers aided by something which is not innate to our minds, but is an artificial symbolic system which we've memorized to the point where it feels a we know of a few cultures, in fact like the Amazonian Indigenous Group Moon Rico, who don't have words for number's larger than five or the Brazilian peter hot.

Speaker 1:          02:43          People who only have names for one and two above that they just say many when tested both the moon to Roku and Pitta. People were able to subitize small numbers and approximate large numbers with the same relative accuracy as Westerners, but they could not gauge the exact amount of many items without the aid of precise number names, subitizing and counting our incredible capabilities of the human brain, which we take for granted every day to appreciate just how fast your brain works. I'll leave you with this. Get your pause buttons ready and pause when you know how many items there are. So

Speaker 1:          03:31          the final point I'll make on this is that it seems after a number of studies that human beings are not the only ones able to make quantitative judgements about objects. Certain species of monkey, horse and bird can subsidize interestingly like us, up to about four. The best review that I found of numerical competence in animals, well worth a read was done in 2011 bite Zana Resonant Cova and Boris Rye out. Sorry for the name butchery, which I'll leave a link for in the description under worksite and follow me on Tumblr. Asked me anything on Tumbler and twitter for short little thoughts, comment below and I will respond. I will respond to everyone. Also post this on Reddit if you like what I do and want me to keep doing it. That has been a great way for people to see these and just get the word about the nerd writer out there. So if you like the nerd writer, post this on Reddit and I will see you next Monday. Yeah, I think so.
