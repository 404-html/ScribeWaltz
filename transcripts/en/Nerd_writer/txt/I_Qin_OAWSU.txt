Speaker 1:          00:01          Coffee on Tuesday and blog for,

Speaker 1:          00:14          do they want to talk about the peaceful protests currently happening in Lower Manhattan called Occupy Wall Street. It's starting to get some buzz in the mainstream media, which I watched obsessively and also the rosy eyes of Michael Moore, so you know it's legitimate. So occupy Wall Street is a leaderless protests with a vague set of demands. It started by Canadian activist group called ad busters and the names, the model of the protest from Tahrir Square in Egypt last March, which unseated their President Mubarak. The Tahrir Square protest had a simple but intense demand move. Bark must resign. The protest in Liberty Park is crowded with lots of littler, less forceful demand. Some of the come to protest unemployment, some protests, the wealth inequality in this country, some of the wars, some of the corruption of campaign finance laws, some environmental issues, and some of them just to create a spectacle despite their demands. Presumably everybody is angry at the same thing.

Speaker 1:          01:04          The reckless abandoned perpetrated on Wall Street which caused the subprime mortgage crisis in 2008. Maybe we should take a minute to understand the financial crisis. One Minute, so Wall Street started bundling home loans together and selling slices of those loans to investors. Investors were making big money, so they started pushing the lender saying, we need more loans. Lenders, we're already giving people loans with good credit, so they started lowering their criteria used to be you needed a credit score of six, 20 and a down payment of 20 percent and they'll settle for a 500 credit score and no money down. Joe Schmo buyer assumes that at the bank's willing to lend him money that he must be able to afford it. He buys his dream house banks. New Securities based on bad mortgages were risky. So to control potential fallout, they started buying insurance mortgages. Default, the insurance company pays default swap, so the banks have potential losses.

Speaker 1:          01:45          In short, the risk moves off their books. They invest more. One insurance company took on more swaps than any other American international group. Why did they do this? Feeds premiums millions. How'd you think of the housing market? We keep going up, but then all of a sudden the housing prices go down. Joe Schmo buyer bought his dream house at a teaser rate mortgage. Now that rate goes away, payments go up. He defaults mortgage back securities tank. Aig has to pay off the swaps, all of them at the same time, all over the world. They can't afford it, of course, so the government does this. The government under treasury secretary Hank Paulson, passes the emergency economic stabilization act through which they can purchase troubled assets and inject capital into the banks from a fund called the troubled asset relief program, which holds a cool $700, billion. Now, the quick legislation did prevent a catastrophe, but it didn't stop people from losing confidence. It didn't stop people from holding onto their money. It didn't stop them from not consuming the goods and services of this economy. So demand goes down. The economy contracts, businesses stop hiring and three years later,

Speaker 2:          02:57          not enough,

Speaker 1:          03:06          I think Wilson said this on Charlie rose in 2008 constituents were angry and they had a right to be angry. They had no part in making this the constituents, that's us. He had no part in making this, but did we? Are we guiltless? They had no part in making this or have we as consumers pushed and pushed for years, every corporation to get us the best deals on our goods and the best returns on our investments are we complicit in a system which was driven to do anything to be Buffett stock value and lower its prices on goods, even to the point of selling bundling and gambling on bad mortgages so that we could get tee shirts at 20th.

Speaker 3:          03:52          Capitalism has strengthened the part of our brain that our consumers and investors, super capitalism has made us terrifically adept at thinking of ourselves and practicing being very, very efficient and adept. Consumers and investors,

Speaker 1:          04:19          don't get me wrong, this is not to say that the Wall Street titans are blameless, but each of us are made up of two parts. The part that is a consumer and the part that is a citizen.

Speaker 3:          04:27          Yes, Washington is awash with corporate lobbyists, but what are those lobbyists actually doing? Most of those lobbyists are there in Washington to get a competitive advantage over their competitors who are also in Washington trying to use public policies to get a competitive advantage over their competitors. The noise level is so high that the public, you and I cannot be heard, at least the citizen cannot be here, the consumer and investor in us. Here's the only voice that is being heard.

Speaker 1:          05:07          We're going to have to be willing to give up some of the benefits that the consumer side of ourselves has gotten in the last few decades and certainly it's important as citizens that we exercise our rights like the people in Liberty Park are doing right now, but perhaps it's more important that as Americans, we exercise our privileges. One of our privileges is to learn and study anything we want and do it systematically. It's important that we lead with reason and not emotion.

Speaker 3:          05:34          People are angry and frustrated and worried about their jobs. If they feel that they are not getting ahead and if they feel that the dice are loaded against them, that somehow the economy is is fixed. That government and business are in cahoots. That's when you ignite the kind of social change that could be very progressive and very reform minded, but also could be very reactionary,

Speaker 1:          05:58          separate some cool articles in the jubilee to about this. Thanks for listening and.
