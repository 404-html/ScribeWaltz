Speaker 1:          00:00          The beard is gone, the hair was gone. The coffee on the Tuesday is right here. Why not? So maybe you heard this story in the news.

Speaker 2:          00:17          The UN Population Fund says the world is about to add. It's 7000000000th person. The UN says the world's population will reach a milestone. This Monday, 7 billion. Pete, the world's population will hit 7 billion, 7 billion, 7 billion come Halloween. There will be so many of us on earth that it's actually kind of scary.

Speaker 1:          00:38          It appears that the good old human races now 7 billion strong, that's nine zero, 133 times around the world counted in step 200 years to count aloud. Starting from one, two, three, four. I did it. So most of what I write is science fiction and the reason I love sciflies because I believe that talking about our future is the best way today to talk about our president. Whereas in the past, the best way to talk about our person was talking about our past. Put it this way. If the rate of technological evolution being so fast, our actions today directly implicate the situation tomorrow. The president. So close to our future that it's like the shingles on the roof of the house. Years, days. Moments almost overlap. Each science fiction can explore this intimate relationship anywhere from the gutter to the very top all the time. Warning that if the structure isn't sound, the roof will collapse.

Speaker 1:          01:24          When I tell people my right side fire, I get the same question again and again. What happens when there are too many people? What happens when the world becomes overpopulated? Well, it's a good question and one I tried to address in my first long fiction novella called big city. I put the link to that whole book online for your pleasure. You can find it in the doodly do, but let's return to the idea of population growth. If you want to know anything about this subject, you have to start with Thomas Malthus and his book. An essay on the principle of population was mount. This is idea that humans are the only animal on earth that increases its population beyond its available resources. Basically, we grow faster than we create food. That leaves us with a whole hell of a lot of people who are underfed and malnourished.

Speaker 1:          02:04          According to Malthus, humanity grows exponentially. Nothing, not even the plague or two world wars can put so much as a blip in that graph in the year 1800, we were 1,000,000,200 years later and we're 7 billion. Obviously we can't keep growing forever, so eventually we're going to hit an asymptote and level out what scientists have a very hard time agreeing on what that number will be. Yes, it's range from 10 billion to 20 billion years. What we do now during the agricultural and industrial revolutions, the life expectancy of children increased dramatically between 1730 and 18. Ten percentage of children who died before the age of five decreased from 74 point five to 31 point eight. Advances in medicine like compulsory vaccination had increased the life expectancy from 38 and 18, 50 to 78 in 2011. The population growth rate hated speed during the 19 sixties baby boom and just over two percent ridiculously high. Some people started to freak out like Paul Albert, you predicted in his 19, 68 book the population bomb that we were headed for severe worldwide. Fortunately, early was wrong. Innovation stepped in and saved the day, and in this case innovation, his name was Norman Burlap,

Speaker 3:          03:06          more than half the farmers of the world living the subsistence agriculture outside of the economies of their own country. They have had very little or no money with which to make purchases of the many items that you need for a decent life,

Speaker 1:          03:23          for is the father of the green revolution initiatives to develop higher yield crops using synthetic fertilizers and hybrid ice. The Nobel Committee estimated that in 1970 by the time he received the prize, he had saved a billion lives. Don't you just feel like shit in his acceptance speech, he said there can be no permanent progress in the battle against hunger until the agencies that fight for increased food production and those that flight for population control unite in a common efforts. Through that the growth rate has been falling ever since the baby boom and chances already won't reach that rate ever again. But consider this diagram, well, birth rates in the developed world decrease and level out around one point seven children per woman in Subsaharan, Africa. The rate remains at five or more, or take a look at the distribution of ages in the developed and undeveloped world. Look at how many children there are in the letter. Subsaharan Africa is also where we see the most poverty and malnourished. Clearly there is a connection between fertility rate and quality of lives. It tells us that a large part of the problem concerning population growth can be addressed by the empowerment of women.

Speaker 4:          04:28          Okay.

Speaker 1:          04:40          That's Joel Cohen, mathematical biologist and author of educating all children a global agenda, saying that not only is nutrition a vital part of balancing population growth in hunger, but also the use of contraception and most importantly education. You can find the link to his Amazon page in the dubliner. I want to make one final point on population growth and I'll have malthus helped me out. Again, I believe that it is the intention of the creator that Earth should be replenished, but certainly with a healthy virtuous and happy population, not an unhealthy vicious and miserable one and if and endeavoring to obey the command to increase and multiply we people at only with beings of this latter description and suffer accordingly. We have no right to impeach the justice of the command, but only our rational emotive executing the justice of the committee. Here. He's talking about God's desire for us to multiply and grow.

Speaker 1:          05:29          Of course that's fully. There is no god. There is no question that as a species and like every other species on earth, we had the innate desire to procreate. Part of it is evolutionary, but the question must be is all of the evolution. Do you want to have kids because you want to ensure the future survival of the human race? Or do you want them for other reasons? Social reasons, because it's strange not to or personal reasons because you crave a specific kind of love because you want to be needed. Even secret reason secret to yourself because you know that you will die and there's no escaping it in one way to ease the pain of is to know that someone will remember you and tell about you and in that you achieve a kind of immortality. Humanity can outgrow its evolutionary instructions. By the time you die.

Speaker 1:          06:07          How many times do you think you'll have had sex to procreate and how many times just for pleasure? Advances in medicine will allow us to live longer just as we jumped from 38 to 78 and 150 years. Advances in technology will not only allow our world to be energy independent, but ourselves. Imagine getting all this sustenance you need from the sun. Imagine living to the age of 200 when you'll really be able to count to 7 billion. Maybe it seems out there too, but evolution like population is exponential and when we can live as long as we want, what will happen to our desire to procreate, to have children? There is no easy way to answer this question, but I do my best to try in a second long fiction, a novel called all languages. The rows coming soon.
