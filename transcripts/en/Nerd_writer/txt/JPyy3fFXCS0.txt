Speaker 1:          00:01          Copy on a Tuesday and blog, 14 crosswalk buttons. What do they work? So contrary to popular belief, people do walk in Los Angeles. I come across the crosswalk button almost everyday. It usually goes like this. I hit the button, nothing happens. Then I hit it repeatedly. Nothing happens. Then I hold it down as if to say, come on. Then something happens and I feel like this. I realize I probably just contracted leprosy because I've been talking that filthy buttons. So what's the deal? Is it all in my head or am I really most at this article from the New York Times in 2004 years? Well worn push buttons have offered harried walkers are rare. Promise of control over their pedestrian lives. First of all, you Michael Lewis

Speaker 2:          00:56          studied journalism. Mass is probably the right adjective.

Speaker 1:          01:04          I'm making fun of Novelis. It turns out the city, the activated most of it's pedestrian buttons longer ago, more than 2,500 of the 3,250. What? Buttons that now exist function essentially as mechanical placebos your mechanical placebo, but it's true with the advent of computer controlled traffic signals. Crossword buttons have largely been deactivated. Major cities. Traffic is controlled by a centralized computers executing complex timing pet. It's how seth green can help Mark Wahlberg get places in his mini coop. But the article is about New York. What about Los Angeles? So is it, is it true that there are certain parts of the day in which

Speaker 3:          01:32          the, uh,

Speaker 1:          01:34          the buttons won't affect

Speaker 3:          01:36          the,

Speaker 1:          01:38          the light because of the, because of the, because of the complex pattern

Speaker 4:          01:42          that I have not heard directly, but I could imagine that that would be the case where there might be certain person the day where it's gonna turn green on its own timing regardless of whether somebody has thought about it or not. Because you know, say if it's rush hour, they want to get the cars brew.

Speaker 1:          01:59          Sure. So placebos were everywhere, yet still we press well, the short answer is humans love. But we've been conditioned all our lives. I believe that buttons do things. Maybe you should just do it.

Speaker 5:          02:10          No,

Speaker 1:          02:13          it's at crosswalks. We see ourselves pushing the button and then we see the little white man cause and effect. Who cares what's happening in between. We hit the stimulus and get the reward that we want. His tendency is called the illusion of control. It's an idea first developed in 1975 by ellen langer. A professor of psychology at Harvard says that we overestimate our ability to control events. Here's one example in casinos at the craps table. It's been shown that people roll harder when they want to get higher numbers and software when they want to get lower numbers, even though dice rolling you, unless you're George Clooney is a chance event. Suzanne Thompson, professor of Psychology Pomona college says that the illusion of control is determined by a control your risk puristic as an experienced based common sense method of problems. The control heuristic is based on two conditions, the intention to create the outcome and the relationship between the outcome and the action.

Speaker 1:          02:57          When I pressed the crosswalk button, I wanted to chant. It does change eventually. That's according to the control here ristick my illusion of control. His strength. I'm more likely to press it again in the future. Is this good or bad for me? You have to decide that for yourself, consider this even with higher illusions of control, are more likely to try new things and subsequently do new things in those with lower loop people who are depressed, show lower illusions of control and it's not hard to see why when you consider their self worth, but it has also been shown that people with higher illusions of control are more likely to commit to failing courses of action. It has been argued that a lack of illusions is associated with a non-defensive personality oriented toward growth and understanding with a low ego involvement in outcome. Now, I think this point is really important.

Speaker 1:          03:35          First, let me say that we are Westerners in the tradition of a western philosophy. It means that we are doers, actors, believers in the will, that it can create and change things. I'm proud of that tradition and growing up in it, I know that I can never totally be a part of eastern philosophy, which is the opposite. Though I believe that there are things we can change. I also believe that there are things we can. One thing we can't change is people, and maybe that seems like an obvious factor, but I think sometimes we want it so badly that we have the illusion that it's in our control, so maybe your short, like 100 percent positive that someone you know is going about something wrong. Well, it takes a non-defensive personality to see that it would be wrong to try to get them to do it right. It may be a little bit counterintuitive, but telling someone what's right for them, thinking that you know what's right for them is a way of exercising control, failed to imagine one another complexity, and in our simplistic view that we can handle another's problems better than even thinking it's an illusion. We'd be better off.

Speaker 2:          04:28          Friend dependent will never fully know until you let go of the illusion of control.

Speaker 1:          04:54          Yeah. The is the best animated movie.

Speaker 2:          05:00          Yeah.
