Speaker 1:          00:17          Flavor that I didn't find any other grand. Try Camels and see

Speaker 2:          00:28          and point at the first men came to western.

Speaker 2:          00:32          Mine had this invention where he's actually almost. It was like mythical or something, but anyway, it was this chamber under ground where you could go and hear everything that anyone had ever said about you behind your back, but in order to get to the best thing which was at the like the lower most chamber, you had to start at the worst insult and work your way down. My friend always used to say he could never make it two steps, but I don't know. I think I could make it to the bottom. Maybe that's because I have a poor imagination. Do you guys have.

Speaker 2:          01:15          It is simply not pleasant to be objectively observed. It's like seeing a candid photo of yourself online, not smiling or posing, but simply looking the way you will apparently always do oblivious and Bush face with your mouth open. It's proof that we are visible to others that we are seeing in all are naked silliness and stupid. A group of friends. I think it's inevitable you're going to spend time talking with one another about one another behind one another's backs and it's not always going to be nice thing, but I think it can be healthy. Your friends are never going to be so perfect that they don't act like an idiot sometimes or repeat their own mistakes or do other things which are so clearly against their interests and I think it's healthy to vent to other mutual friends about how aggravating and crazy this person can be if for nothing, but to ensure that in this instance, the crazy one isn't you.

Speaker 3:          02:13          First of all, brands don't talk behind your back. So one thing is when people talk behind your back, it really shows you what kind of friendly. Our first thing to remember is that if anyone talks behind your back, they're probably doing because they're jealous.

Speaker 2:          02:32          Other day at lunch, I was part of a whole group of colleagues, colleagues in my school and who were talking behind our bosses back.

Speaker 3:          02:41          I mean like, seriously. It just is like isn't necessary. It's not. It's not necessary.

Speaker 2:          03:13          We're talking behind someone's back. Ken, just be plain Shitty, especially when you're trying to gain the favor of one friend at the expense of another, these purely negative gossip or the kinds of talk that we should try our best to avoid and speak up against when we hear it began. As kreider says, the operative fallacy here is that we believe that unconditional love means not seeing anything negative about someone, but usually the fact that friends talk behind other friends backs is precisely because they have a stake in the friendship and spend a lot of time thinking about this person whom they love. Talking with friends about friends like talking with friends is the important work of French. Just like telling a friend that you love them is as important as telling another friend that you told your friend that you love them. So much of what we tell others is what we want for ourselves. Does it have to be as circuitous as this? Thank you so much. Thank you. This is great. Oh, that friend who his name is Jake. Just a friend of mine. He's a great guy. Learn your instruments.

Speaker 4:          04:24          You want me to dance as well? It's a beautiful dance for them. For the electric guitar lesson.
