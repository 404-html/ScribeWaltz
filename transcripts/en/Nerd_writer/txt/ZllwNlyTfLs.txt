Speaker 1:          00:02          It's hard to believe, but Thursday marks three years since the final episode of breaking bad air on TV while it was on breaking bad grip, the culture of more tightly than almost any other show and its legacy is still intact today, I think because the arc of episodes that concluded the story brought a satisfying and brutal reckoning on what came before. I think the best episode of the series can be found in that arch and today I want to talk about that episode as humanity is the poem it references and how the ideas in both help us understand the show as a whole. In a lot of ways. This episode though, third from the last book ends the entire series right or more wily Beckett makes this explicit by staging the pre opening credits scene as a flashback to the first episode when Walter White and Jesse Pinkman are making their very first batch of crystal Meth, the reaction has begun.

Speaker 1:          00:58          The narrative of the show is its own kind of chemical reaction brought about by choices like walters choice to make crystal meth to raise money for his cancer treatment. Like the first lie, he's rehearsing to tell his wife about this, that lead to the horrifying consequences we're about to witness director Ryan Johnson makes these things explicit in another way. We're more wildly. Beckett, has plot and dialogue. Johnson has visuals, visuals like the slow fading of past elements that show the passage of time and the disappearance of the people and the things that once were. What we see in this episode is effectively the bloody end of Heisenberg's rain. But what's interesting is how not bloody it is while he beckett in Johnson placed the focus instead on reactions, reaction shots, and so we get an episode of Gazans. Quizzical gates is angry, gazes blankies is penetrating gazes. What's important isn't that wall gets away with holly, for example, but that skylar sees it. The death of Hank is showed for all of two seconds before Ryan Johnson quickly cuts away. Compare this to the 44 seconds. He lingers on Walt Skyler's, Flynn's emory's reaction to that news. So in this episode we see Walter White through the eyes of everyone else, including virtually all of the key players in the show. And as is often the case, these people see more about walt, then he can about himself, the smartest guy I ever met.

Speaker 1:          02:34          He made up his mind 10 minutes ago. All these reactions, these gates makes waltz, own tragedy even more stark. It's his inability to see himself through the eyes of those around him. Other people's gazes are like a mirror that we use to see ourselves as Johnson highlights twice in this episode. Waltz not ready to look into mirrors yet when he arrives home later in the episode, he uses all his regular to me, negotiated everything is going to be fine. Both of you to trust me. You have to go right now. But his words fall flat on skylar and they sound absurd to us. While he beckett uses these words brilliantly. I think as an extension of Walt's blindness, I mean this is the climactic scene of the episode and the climactic moment in the scene is not the fight between Walton skylar, but our reaction bracketed by two versions of the same line, but first time walt screams it.

Speaker 1:          03:35          But when he finally glimpses himself through the eyes of his family, those same words deflate entirely. This is where we can find some insight in the episode title Ozymandias, which references a sonnet by Percy shelley from 18, 18. In fact, it's the poem that Bryan Cranston reads in a promotional video for the season showing that Vince Gilligan and the writers wanted to highlight this connection. The poem tells the story of Shelly's meeting with a traveler who describes in detail a ruined sculpture of Ozymandias, the Greek name for Ramses, the second, the most powerful Pharaoh of the Egyptian empire, and the empty landscape where his great empire used to stand. Some of the parallels here are obvious like this shot where Walter white falls rigidly to the ground like a statue crumbling like walters frown and wrinkled lip, like the lone level sands stretch far away, Ryan Johnson even stages some visual flourishes like having the broken glass of the car window look a lot like Walton, Jesse's blue meth, visualizing their empire fading into the desert like the poem breaking bad is a comment on the transients of power and the arrogance of those who acquire it, but the poem is also about seeing through the eyes of others.

Speaker 1:          04:51          After all, we only see Ozymandias through the eyes of the sculptor and the sculptors work through the eyes of the traveler and the traveler is common through the words of the poet. I think this is so applicable to breaking bad and to this episode particularly because what makes drama work, what makes it interesting isn't climactic action scenes or the bombastic declaration of colorful characters or even big ideas. It's the succession of reactions that cascade off of every choice, that chemical and emotional reactions of people living together on earth these days. There is an incredible pressure for show runners have a show like this to have an end in mind to stick the landing with big payoffs and developments that will shock all of us. Well Ozymandias has those things, but I give the writers and director major credit for sticking to what matters in an incredibly important episode for letting us see Walter White, king of kings undoing through the many eyes of those who loved him.
