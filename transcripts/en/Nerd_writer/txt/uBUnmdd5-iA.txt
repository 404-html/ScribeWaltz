Speaker 1:          00:22          Generally, it's the attitude with which humor is towed, which I enjoy

Speaker 2:          00:52          that little bit of slapstick comedy by the Great Rowan Atkinson is as simple as it gets. Unsuspecting man walks into a tree. It's probably the most famous bit from the late 1970 [inaudible] sketch show that Atkinson starting called not the 9:00 news and what elevates it beyond a simple joke is the same thing that makes Atkinson one of the world's most gifted physical comedians attitude. I mean, look at this sweet little man noticing a camera being self conscious at first, but just at the moment he starts to feel a little bit special. He's undercut. Atkinson has the chops of the very best physical comedians like Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton or shock dot, but what sets them apart I think is this natural gift for characterization. Nonverbal characterization, not just the ability to do funny things physically, but the ability to use that physicality to broadcast and attitude. The things that make me laugh on characters, you know, it's people who kind of present a sort of truth to.

Speaker 2:          01:51          I mean, even though it's mad or it's funny or it's wacky or it's rude or it's or it's silly, but there's a sort of a truth there that you identify with. Of course, most people know Atkinson as Mr Bean, the globally famous character he created who's mostly wordless antics, call back to the visual comedy of silent films. Most Americans probably know him from the being feature films that came later, but the original Sitcom which ran for only 15 episodes across six years is where the best being work is. That's generally because the more cinematic the format, the less interesting Mr. Bean becomes. Atkinson doesn't need much more than the single two shot to work wonders. Unlike Chaplin Keaton, Atkinson isn't a director. He's a performer through

Speaker 1:          02:35          this is hell no, I am the devil. Good evening, but you couldn't call me toby if you like. We tried to keep things informal here as well as infertile. That's just a little joke is why

Speaker 2:          02:56          I think Atkinson's purist and often work is in his stage shows no frills, just a man and his audience. These shows make the most of Atkinson's talents. The skits are funny, but the attitude in which they're performed is the

Speaker 1:          03:11          Jordan tried to keep things in full here as well as in fertile. That's just a little joke on, on names, anus. Awesome.

Speaker 3:          03:36          I'm a dick. I'm a dick.

Speaker 1:          03:44          You know, a lot of prospective brides asked me these days, father, what is the church's attitude to fellatio? And I tend to reply by telling them a little story about the first time I was asked that question. All jokes that require the performer to strike the exact right tone

Speaker 2:          04:16          because it's the character that makes them work, not the punchlines. It's the way this freeze cracks the communion wafer and dips it into the wine. It's the dead pan seriousness of this school master doing a totally absurd roll call. It's the way the devil drops his head to the side with a bit of self deprecation. The character is the joke.

Speaker 1:          04:45          This is the comedy personality. It's not about doing funny things. It's about doing something quite normal in a funny way

Speaker 2:          04:58          that's actually Atkinson himself acting in narrating a documentary, really along video essay on the principles of visual comedy. I'll link to it below. Definitely watched the whole thing in describing the comedy of personality. Atkinson is describing what excites him the most, but also what he's the best app. For example, if you were to take the comedy of personality to its most extreme, he probably get a sketch like this one where Atkinson gives an acting lecture, portraying a bunch of different personalities,

Speaker 1:          05:27          Imessenger and just bearing good news

Speaker 3:          05:34          I mentioned to inches

Speaker 1:          05:40          bad news

Speaker 3:          05:47          messenger

Speaker 1:          05:48          and just burying bad news, which he thinks is good news.

Speaker 2:          05:58          There's really no joke at all here. Just personalities and personalities within personalities. Atkinson is playing his self serious actor playing various different parts. The actor is proudly displaying his talent, but when something goes wrong, we get a glimpse of

Speaker 3:          06:13          character underneath and it's even funny to really grasp and audience with comedy.

Speaker 2:          06:19          This takes enormous precision and those who can do it have a style that is completely inimitable, which is sort of ironic since being a physical comedian requires a mastery of invitation and a minute study of human behavior. These comedians find comedy in the slightest things, the way someone flicks a wrist or the way someone pronounces the first letter in a word and he knew we're feels a single piano note. We're signifies a whole nationality with the tiniest

Speaker 1:          06:52          as well as the Russians. Generally the things that make me laugh or characters, you know, it's people who kind of present a sort of truth to you. I mean even though it's mad or it's funny or it's wacky or it's rude or it's though it's silly, but there's a sort of a truth there that you identify with and you think that situation I've been there, I've seen someone like that on the train or I am someone like that and I prefer to keep it hidden. And yet here, here I am being characterized extremely well and that's
