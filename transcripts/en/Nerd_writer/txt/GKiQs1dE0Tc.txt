Speaker 1:          00:01          So there's a great scene near the beginning of shame, blacks, the nice guys, which more people should have seen in theaters, by the way, you know what? Fuck the angry birds. Anyway, we're Ryan gosling. A private investigator breaks into a bar to get his hands on some receipts like we've seen people do a million times before in movies. Gosling is going to break the glass to unlock the door from inside, but things really don't go as planned. Besides being a hilariously funny reversal and subversion of an old cliche, I think this moment gets to the heart of Shane. Blacks interests in awkward violence and deeper than that in film, new wars, obsession with violence as the undying backdrop to civilization. Speaking of backdrops, you made not be familiar with Shane Black, but his work has been in the backdrop of Hollywood for 30 years now, starting as a writer during the SPEC script boom of the late eighties, nineties, and early two thousands when unsolicited original scripts were really high.

Speaker 1:          00:58          Demand Black wrote lethal weapon one end to the last boy scout, long kiss goodnight. Then went on to direct his written work in films like kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang, iron man three, and finally the Nice guys. All of these films share similar themes, so I'll have fractured characters all take place in dangerous, often. See me. Worlds all have whipped fast plots, reversals, betrayals, and plenty of character revealing banter. In other words, they all share the traits of film noir. There's a certain madness, I think in a certain bizarre quality of violence in the war films where it's devastating. It's just ongoing. It's not just clever. It's devastating.

Speaker 1:          01:39          At this point, we're clearly not lacking in violence at the movies. Blockbuster and tent pole films are a wash in this stuff. Explosions, car crashes, chases, fights, you name it. There are some directors and stunt coordinators who are really good at it. For example, the Captain America Franchise I think has mastered a very sharp part hitting type of superhero violence where other franchises have struggled to meet that bar, but the thing about violence in superhero films is that it's fun, but never really that consequential, particularly if it's heroes fighting heroes come on, black widow, you know these people are slated until like 20, 22, right? A lot of these films add violence to the mix to spice up things every 20 minutes or so, they write themselves up to the brink and then let the stunt coordinators take it from there, making sure a few beats or hit along the way.

Speaker 1:          02:26          This isn't necessarily bad. Sometimes it's awesome, but it's not all that violence can do. The question you should be asking isn't where you should add violence, but how can you use it? Take that scene from the beginning. With gosling, it accomplishes so much in such a short period of time. It subverts that cliche for comedic effect. It's a quick reversal of narrative momentum. It shows how hapless gosling's character is, and an accidental slitting of the risk plays into the deeper sadness that underlies his drunkenness. I kind of 40 and slit shane black is a master at using violence to augment story and character in his action. Thrillers and neo wars want to show that a police detective his past his prime. What if you want to show that a detective craves violence in an almost masochistic way in blacks films, the violence is often messy and shocking and awkward because that's what real violence is like.

Speaker 1:          03:19          It's a kind of chaos, a rupture in things. The inciting incident in a long kiss goodnight is a perfect example of this. Gina Davis hits a deer with her car, which would be enough to send the car careening off the road by itself, but black has the deer come through the windshield, still alive, kicking the passenger in the face. This is awkward and transfixing in a way that leaves us on guarded against the violence of the moment. In consequence, we become more present for the whole scene. The pencil trick in the dark night, by the way, achieves a similar effect. Another thing black likes to do is visit violence on an otherwise piece. The thing that black likes to do is visit.

Speaker 2:          04:07          Maybe

Speaker 1:          04:07          I should just let black say it in his own words, in this country where we think everything's settled and stable and serene, something horribly violent can intrude upon our piece and then we have to go back to this gunslinger who knew all along that the war wasn't over in the west, wasn't gentrified, black uses sudden violence not only to shock the audience, but as a way to justify an animate his heroes and heroines. The point is that this is violence with narrative purpose. That purpose may be as simple as keeping the audience on their toes or fingers, finger, yeah, it may be a way to solve a simple problem or it might reveal what a character's really like or who he would like to be. Just we all live around violence, but by and large were separate from it. A good new or thriller lets us travel to the other side, dip our feet into that current, feel, how cold it is, if we've had the bad fortune to experience it firsthand, we know that violence can be indiscriminate and deeply personal at the same time, violence done right in these movies.

Speaker 1:          05:19          Violence as a plot element or an exhibition of character. Awkward violence is violence, respected. Of course, at the end of the day, these are just movies, pulpy, detective stories, genre flicks, but I wouldn't want to live in a universe that didn't have pulpy genre detective movies like lethal weapon or kiss, kiss, Bang, Bang. I think Shane Black is one of the few action thriller writers who incorporates violence into his scripts creatively and I'm glad he's still getting work for that to keep happening. Of course we have to keep going to see his movies and it. Unless that is your okay with the alternative

Speaker 2:          05:58          to the birds.
