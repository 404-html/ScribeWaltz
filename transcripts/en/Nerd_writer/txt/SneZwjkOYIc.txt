Speaker 1:          00:01          Coffee on a Tuesday and block 36,

Speaker 1:          00:14          so living in New York City for a few months now. I've noticed that a lot of the shops and restaurants are cash now. This is generally pretty annoying since, as I imagine a lot of you out there like me and I've gotten pretty used to paying for things with credit or debit card. So the question is why? Why do so many establishments only accept cash? What's the incentive for them to be cash only in June, let's say you're buying a $2 cup of coffee. Okay, so you hand over your credit card to the Barista who swipes it in her credit card. Trump, you know you've seen, you've seen what those things look like. That thing reads the magnetic strip on the back of the card and sends the transaction to the acquiring bank. Acquiring Bank pays the coffee shop $2 and the acquiring bank, it's their $2 from an issuing bank.

Speaker 1:          00:56          Think Citibank, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, which in turn takes the money from your account. This relationship between the coffee shop and the acquiring bank is called a merchant account. When the coffee shop opened up, in order to get one of those fancy credit card terminals, it had to set up a merchant account with an acquiring bank. Then it could take your plastic. Are you with me so far about merchant accounts work and a lot of different ways, but all of them are going to impose a certain number of fees on our little coffee shop. Some of those feeds come from the acquiring bank, but most are coming up through the system from the issuing bank set by the credit card companies, mastercard, visa, discover, so when our coffee shops swipes your card and for every other card and swipes, the issuing bank is going to charge a small interchange fee.

Speaker 1:          01:39          Most commonly these fees are set up into what's called a three tier pricing system. Now, a normal swipe of the card, that's going to be first tier and you'll take the smallest charge of all, probably about one point two percent of the cost. The fees don't end. Their car doesn't get accepted the first time. That's a nuisance. Every swipe, no matter what, if it's going to the issuing bank, that's an authorization thing. At the end of every month you have a statement that didn't pay enough and these that. Don't worry, we'll just add a little bit more to make sure you hit your monthly minimum things settling out all your days. Purchases. Well, that's a batch we need to use customer service to figure out what the hell is going on with all these fees. Customer service fee. Okay, so you've had enough. You're sick and tired of the fees you want out of this credit card thing for early termination fee.

Speaker 1:          02:24          Sorry to be sure there are good reasons for charging our little coffee shop rates and fees. There is such a thing as transaction costs, but as you can probably guess, there are serious abuses as what an enormous antitrust lawsuit which was filed by 7 million merchants in 2005 was settled earlier this year in which the car companies paid out seven point $3,000,000,000 with a beat. The accusation was that credit card companies had colluded with banks to engage in anti competitive activities which allowed them to raise fees higher than normal on credit card purchases without letting the little coffee shops of the world raise their prices to accommodate. In addition to the payout, the lawsuit changed just that it allows merchants to raise their prices to accommodate credit card fees. The thinking was that if they could do this, make a dissuade people from using credit cards and the credit card companies will be forced to bring the transaction fees day, but with a whopping 68 percent of all credit card purchases coming from visa and mastercard, that may be a pipe dream. Maybe you can understand why a lot of small businesses don't accept credit cards. They can't afford it and they have to hope that people like me will go out and get the cash instead of going somewhere else like starbucks who can handle the feets and I would do it too. I get real money. The problem is that the ATM next door to the coffee shop, it charges me 2:50 to take out cash.

Speaker 1:          03:53          Fifty two books, 52 weeks. Fifty two books. Did you weeks? If you follow me on Tumbler, I will feel bad about not reading the books if I don't read them. So that's why you should follow me because you are the ones that are gonna. Help me finish all these books. Support small business.
