Speaker 1:          00:00          That's John was very tenacious people. They love molesting child's. It's crazy. It's like their favorite thing. I mean when you can get so crazy because when you consider the risk and being a child molester, speaking not even the damage you're doing, but the risk, there is no worse life available to a human. That being a child molester and yet they still do it, which from you could only really surmised that it must be really good, but from their point of view, it must be amazing for that.

Speaker 2:          00:45          That joke offensive. Some people seem to think that it is.

Speaker 3:          00:49          What if victims are watching what a victim's parents are watching? It's such a sickening thing that happens to people that I know comedians try to push the limit and they sometimes take risks and they don't work, but I think with something like child molestation, it's just not funny and he's too clever. Like he could come up with a thousand dollars.

Speaker 2:          01:11          What are we really asking? When we asked whether a joke or a tweet or an image is offensive or not? We're not asking really whether it's someone was offended or we know. We're asking if what was said was morally right, how could somebody determined that? How do we know what a joke, for example, is morally and I feel there is no forum that is acceptable for this ever. I know some

Speaker 1:          01:36          that was molested at three years old, three years old, no nightclub.

Speaker 2:          01:41          Oh, no place ever deserves to have

Speaker 1:          01:46          that person. It

Speaker 2:          01:47          seems to think that it's the effect of the joke that matters because child molestation is such a sensitive subject because the harm caused is so gruesome and lasting because any light hearted mention of it could in some way diminish the suffering of victims or bring that pain back. Child molestation as a topic should be wholly avoided in the realm of comedy. Now, that's certainly a persuasive argument. Comedies, purpose can't be to cause pain to innocent victims, but of course that wasn't the purpose of Louis. CK is joke in the first place. It wasn't his intent. It just comes down to one question. Intent. It's all about intent. It's only about intent. In that clip, Ricky Gervais' argues the opposite of effect being the moral judge of a joke, and instead says that it's the comedians intention that really matters in the end, clearly Louis Ck is intention in that joke is to use comedy to get us to think about society's attitude and treatment of pedophilia, perhaps see intimate, that we revile this demographic to blindly taking solace in our normalcy when we know that the complexities of sexuality means that the urge to pedophilia is not something chosen never does he forgive or validate the act.

Speaker 2:          03:03          He takes it for granted that child abuse of any kind deserves the harshest scorn and retribution. This, I think is the intent and for many the effect of this joke, a subtle indictment of our smug righteousness and our fear of the law lessness of sexuality in civilized society. Indeed jokes are uniquely designed to deliver messages like this. They sneak into consciousness past the barriers that normally defend against the ways of thinking that threaten our comfort. Now, that's not to say that I totally agree with Jervis, that intention is all that matters. Clearly it isn't. We have to be aware of both the intention and the unintended consequences of what we say. We all know that too often those in privileged defined the boundaries of morality without taking into account the decidedly different experiences of those who've been subjugated or marginalized or worse. These debates about political correctness and comedy had been happening more and more frequently as the Internet has given voice to more and more people. I'm always amazed at how the arguments devolved so quickly into two opposing camps. One side, we'll raise a concern about a joke and the other will come down hard defending jokes at all costs, lamenting the never ending encroachment of Pc police and social justice warriors on free speech.

Speaker 4:          04:23          Just want to use these words. That's racist, sexist. That's prejudice.

Speaker 2:          04:30          What all this says to me is that morality is messy. It shifts and changes, and people often say that something went over the line, but there are no lines in morality. There's a no mans land, a nebulous fringe of very, very tough questions. The way I see it, great comedians are like, detectives will take a look at luther or any other detective movie or TV show, and it's easy to see that as a society, we're sympathetic to the idea of letting detectives bend the rules for the greater good. This is because we understand that justice, like morality is abstract. Detectives are trained to navigate the swamps at the edges of justice and we give them the leeway to do so. My opinion is that our best comedians should be given the same reasonable leeway with morality. I don't know how the culture determines who's allowed to do this. There are no easy answers for that. I think when a comedian is inducted into the professions highest ranks, we just sort of know though I see how unsatisfying and answers that is. Other than that, all we can do is look at the jokes. They're intense, they're effect, and whether or not we're laughing, but if we want our collective morality to remain nuanced and progressive, we have to let comedians near the things we find uncomfortable or perhaps even wrong.
