Speaker 1:          00:03          You try to preserve a fleeting moments well, depends what you call bleeding. Sometimes a geologic sense, the years of a pretty woman and sometimes with the people, the 25th of a second

Speaker 2:          00:19          these days, you're most likely to see the work of American photographer, ansell Adams on a postcard or on the wall of your boss's office. His photographs are so ubiquitous now that it's easy to walk by them without noticing their technical anesthetic mastery. Indeed, thanks to things like instagram and snapchat, photographs in general are so ever present in our lives that standards about what we believe to be great work in this field are drowned out by the literally billions of photos that are uploaded to the services. Every day I come across something that excites me. I see the picture in my mind is high and I make the photograph and then I give it to you as the equivalent of help. In the beginning, ansell Adams took photographs. Not unlike all those millions of us on instagram as a visual diary of his experience, Adams took his first Brownie box camera on trips to the Sierra Nevada mountains to place that wouldn't throw him for the rest of his life.

Speaker 2:          01:18          His early photographs are enthusiastic, but uninspired. Adam had that feeling that I have every single time I pick up a still camera of not getting in the print. What I see with my eyes. Now, this is largely because of the dynamic range of the human eye. The brightest and darkest thing it can see at the same time exceeds any film or Digital Camera, especially those answers was using in the early 20th century, but this all changed friends on April 10th, 19, 27. The footage you're watching right now is from an excursion. Adams took with his future wife, Virginia, to the half dome in Yosemite National Park, holding his corona view camera, two lenses to filters, a heavy wouldn't tripod and 12 class plates. He made his way onto the so-called diving board where you can look along the side of the massive granite dome. And here Adams had a vision of what he wanted his image to look like. He cites this as his first conscious use of the technique called visualization, the whole key live specifically in seeing it to the mind's eye, which we call it visualization. First, Adam's tried his yellow filter. This is the image it produced similar probably to what Adam saw looking through the camera's viewfinder, but it's not what he visualized in his mind's eye. There was no excitement in the frame, so he took out his red filter for a second shot. He said the exposure at [inaudible] and expose the plate for five seconds.

Speaker 2:          02:56          When Adam's developed this photo and it his internal visualization, he knew that this was his life's calling, and look at the difference, it makes the darkened sky charges the image with drama and intensity in contrast, and Adams had an instinctive genius about tonal balance. In contrast, and to formalize this craft to ensure that he could achieve his visualizations. He developed another tool with his friend Fred Archer called the zone system. The zone system splits the full range of black to white into 11 separate zones, each one f stop or aperture setting apart. The photographer spot meter is different elements in his frame and determines where everything fits in the zones. This way, the photographer has a sense of what his entire frame will look like before he shoots knowing how everything will change with different exposures. To take a look at Adam's famous photo of the tetons and the snake river taken in 1942. The contrast here is really incredible and to get a better sense of it. Let's pixelate the image. Look how Adams represents basically every zone in the system all the way from zone zero, full black in the shadow of the mountains here to zone 10 in the light reflecting off the river. What's even more extraordinary is his ability to capture the highlight detail in the clouds and elsewhere on the river and the shadow details and the trees that covered the bank.

Speaker 3:          04:18          Perhaps music is the most expressive. However, as a photographer, I believe that a photography practice in terms of quality may also reveal endless horizons, meaning

Speaker 2:          04:39          ansell Adams work, his devotion to craft and more importantly, intention in photography is an important example in our time when there are more pictures posted in six months than there are stars in the Milky Way Galaxy. Having fought so hard for the acceptance of photography as an art, Adams probably would've laughed at a statistic like that today. Everyone has a camera, but how many visualize what they're going to capture beforehand? How many measure the light or hike for a day to reach the perfect spot so the next time you walk by one of Ansell Adams photographs in the hallway of your doctor's office, take a longer look and remember that our photographic world is the one he gave us.

Speaker 4:          05:24          Anything that excites me is that within not too many years, we're going to have a title, a new medium of expression that they hit me and I know the potentials are there. I don't want to be wonderful.

Speaker 2:          05:37          Hey everybody. Thanks for watching. I love insulate them. Such a good hearted person and a great artist and I had so much fun making this, a lot of cool things that I was experimenting with here, which is what I love to do. I just love to experiment with editing and try to give you something that I hope you haven't seen before on Youtube.
