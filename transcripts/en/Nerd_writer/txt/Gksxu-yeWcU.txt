Speaker 1:          00:00          Here's a question for aspiring screenwriters. Is it possible to make the movie passengers better with some relatively minor changes? You know, I don't think this is a really bad film. After hearing reviews from friends and online, I sort of expected it to be, but I think that feeling was mostly disappointed. Expectation passengers is by no means a train wreck. It's just really, really predictable to the plot goes like this. After the interstellar spaceship, avalon malfunctions, Chris Pratt wakes up from hyper sleep 90 years before he supposed to 90 years before anyone else on the ship. You can't go back to sleep. You can't contact her if you can't get to the ship's controls. He tries to do all of these things and fails. As a year passes. He grows increasingly sad and hopeless, so eventually he decides to wake up another passenger, Jennifer Lawrence condemning her to the same fate, essentially death in order to give himself some more company.

Speaker 1:          00:53          He acts like gets another malfunction. He doesn't tell her after a while, they fall in love. She finds out the truth gets really mad, and then the ship begins to really malfunctioned. So Pratt sacrifices himself to save it, but in the end she saves him a fall in love again and spend the rest of their lives alone on the ship happily ever after. Oh, and Laurence Fishburne send it to about 12 or 13 minutes and act three, but you know, count your blessings. It's way better than what Oscar nominated actor Andy Garcia got. So you can break this blood up into five basic turning points. One, Chris Wakes up to Chris Wakes Jennifer up. Three, she finds out for Chris Sacrifices himself and five, she forgives him. The most acute tension in the film happens between parts two and three. When Jennifer starts to fall in love with Chris, but doesn't yet know the truth.

Speaker 1:          01:42          We know the truth is coming. There's a little dramatic irony there. And so we wait with increasing anxiety until it does and when it does, predictably, Jennifer freaks out predictably and we feel a little sadness predictably at this point, exactly an hour into the movie. The script has sort of written itself into a corner because Pratt is the real main character because we spend 30 minutes alone with him at the start of the film and see everything through his eyes. There's really only two paths to take regarding the central relationship. Either he dies or she forgives him in both ways. He finds APP solution for the sin he committed because you're not going to be able to turn him bad. Not a character like this, not unless you have five seasons to do it, and yes, I know there are some illusions to the shining here, put the shining, spent pretty much no time at all and deering us to the character of Jack Torrance.

Speaker 1:          02:31          Passenger spends the whole first act and during us to the lovable, scrappy, Chris Pratt. It's clear the creators or the studio were intent on this being a love story, so they chose to go with the schmaltzy ending, but they could have chosen either the last 45 minutes would have been the same movie, pretty much devoid of real tension or suspense, which requires a completely new plot device. In the third act. The total malfunction of the ship to juice, the ending with some adrenaline. You know, a couple of weeks ago I was watching Chris Sztokman and Doug Walkers, joint review of passengers and Walker said something interesting if they told this in a different order. Yeah. When have been 10 times more interesting. The thing I began to wonder is what if you rearrange the movie so that Jennifer Lawrence was the point of view character, not Chris Pratt. What if the film began with her experience? Well, I couldn't stop thinking about it, so I re edited the existing footage. See what would happen to the story. Good morning, Aurora. How are you feeling? You just spent 120 years of suspended animation. Grand Concourse.

Speaker 2:          03:56          Anybody? Hello? Hi, he passenger or crew passenger? Jim Preston. Do you know what's going on? Nobody else from my Robo Cup.

Speaker 1:          04:16          Same for me when I made this change and just watched from there some interesting things started to happen. First of all, the first act changes its tone entirely with the original first act. You're wandering around the ship with Chris Pratt. You learn cool things. You see him come to terms with the situation, have fun, get depressed, and finally reached the ethical dilemma that's meant to animate the movie. What you see is what you get here, which makes for a somewhat passive viewing experience. It's an amazing sequence, but that's mostly down to cool production design and pratts always charming performance. I guess I am going to die of old age on this ship, but in the new first act, the story is infused from the start with mystery. When I made the editing changes, I was genuinely surprised by just how creepy pratts character is. When you take away his point of view, we don't know whether to trust him or not, believe him or not, and that makes the audience's experience an active one in every moment to you know what's going on. Nobody else from my robot

Speaker 2:          05:15          cut.

Speaker 1:          05:17          Same for me as he leads Jennifer around the ship locations become crime scenes where the viewer tries to figure out what's happening. This of course, by the way, is what makes Andrei Tarkovsky Solara so great. So much has happened on Solaris by the time the lead character arrives that he and the audience have to piece the fragments together themselves. I mean, just look at how creepy he is. I actually think that pratts performance takes on more dimensions from this angle. You're not always forced to see him as sympathetic, so his darker side comes out in greater relief. More important than that. That dark choice that sits at the heart of this film hits with greater impact when seen from the first time from Lawrence's perspective, because we feel the cruelty as she feels it too to your wake me up.

Speaker 1:          06:00          I try not to, so now we're at the point where the original story hits that dead end, but with this new edit, you have some more options to play with. Namely with this configuration, you could actually turn Pratt into the villain. The original film suggests that can't follow through on and make passengers into the thriller horror film that so many critics wanted to see. You could even cut back in that whole first section of Chris's time alone on the ship, but put it after the revelation without the need to justify his good guidance. You could show a deeper, more desperate side to his loneliness. Something that I think actually would make him more sympathetic in the end and the choice he makes more agonizing.

Speaker 1:          06:59          Of course, the simple cut and paste doesn't solve every problem in the script. The ending, for example, there's still an issue. I think you'd want to remove the malfunction macguffin, but it might be just as trite to close the story and true horror fashion. It could be cool to give it a twilight zone ending as Peter Spread at slashfilm suggested and have di and Lawrence get so lonely that she begins to contemplate the same horrible choice. Brainstorming like this is obviously really fun and much easier than actually writing a movie and making one for all its faults. Passengers is a big budget movie with a completely original script and that should be celebrated because it's a dying breed, but if I'm like, this is a good opportunity for would be screenwriters to think about story because you can learn just as much from films that don't work as you can from those that do.
