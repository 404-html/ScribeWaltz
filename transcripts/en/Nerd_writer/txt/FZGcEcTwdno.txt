Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello, all you vagrants and vagaries coffee on a Tuesday and Vlog 57. You know, we have to put this Tuesday thing to bed because you guys always comment, but you don't release on a Tuesday. What's the deal with that? The truth is I don't film on a Tuesday. I don't write on a Tuesday. Sometimes I edit on Tuesday and I most usually don't release on a Tuesday either. It's just sort of become this running joke. I mean I sometimes think, you know, it's Tuesday somewhere, but then I realized that doesn't make any sense and then I think I just liked the way it sounds.

Speaker 2:          00:37          Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:38          Rem Koolhaas in his famous delirious New York writes, the metropolis strives to reach a mythical point where the world is completely fabricated by man so that it absolutely coincides with his desires. You're right, it's true here. All geometries are achingly formal, even the parks and public gardens fits snugly into the parallelograms that the streets and avenues draw. Anything you want. You can have. The metropolis is made for consumption, leisure, ease of travel. It compliments and encourages that profound pulp fiction novel truth, which is that after 1920, the whole world became about Saturday night getting set

Speaker 1:          01:26          the inevitability is about this city and all cities, I suspect is that as you consume it, it consumes you and it fills you up with its own self. To the exclusion of all else, man hadn't is the perfect metaphor for itself because it's literally an island and if it all of a sudden broke off and float it out into the Atlantic, it's unclear how many of us would really mine. Of course we'd have to take Brooklyn in. Tow. Cities are designed in a very insular way to obscure the world outside their walls from the ground. You can only see a few blocks in every direction and the city just recedes into more city. Its residence in this way worship the present moment in salvos of anxiety and pleasure, and in that worship and within these geometric towers, there is no anchor to the outside world.

Speaker 1:          02:11          No frame of reference in time spins out of control like how in the lack of properly defined seasons, Los Angeles skips from year to year without remark and in the absence of structure, a relativism takes hold. A feeling of an Omi sits heavily on the salt and Omi, the lack of social or ethical standards in an individual or group. As God dies and the great cities are born and Omi is the keynote of the world and we wait for the harvest of a godless, relativistic morality. Last Friday was the full moon. I came out of the subway and was transfixed as transfixed as if I had seen an intruder in my home. It hung there brightly indifferently shining and observing the comings and goings of all the harried city dwellers as the culture around them decayed and advanced at just the same right. I was reminded of the night a stall, foes brief sojourn to the moon in our stoves.

Speaker 1:          03:07          Famous Orlando Furioso were searching for a cure to Orlando's madness. The night comes upon that valley where all last things on earth are found deep in a veil conducted by his guide where Rosa Mountain steep on either side. He came and saw a wonder to relate whatever was wasted in our earthly state here, safely treasured each neglected, good time, squandered or occasion it'll bestowed, not only here our wealth inceptors found that everchanging shift the unsteady round, but those possessions while on Earth we live which fortunes hand can neither take nor give much. Fame is there which here the creeping hours consume till time at length. The whole devours their vows and their unnumbered prayers remain, which often God the center makes in vain. The frequent tiers that lover's eyes suffuse the size they breed. The days that gamesters lose the leisure given which fools so often neglect the week designs that never take effect.

Speaker 1:          04:10          Whatever designs the mortal breasts, a sale in countless numbers filled the uncovered vale for whatever is lost by humankind. Ascending here, you treasured safe may find. And then I wondered if a [inaudible] saw the long lost tenants of common law or under some garland chance to find the sea cast fragments of unquiet mind discarded like flattery's proffer toward that bone white kingdom without a lord as a fool to a stranger's care consigns his own children and foremost rhymes would the night please with Orlando's vial on his chariot span the starlit aisle, and bring to those who cast off and forgot the essence of this urban thought.
