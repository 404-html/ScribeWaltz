Speaker 1:          00:01          Hm,

Speaker 2:          00:12          okay. We're somewhere in the catskill mountains. I don't know exactly where we're at. Hudson stone. This is round tot. We're going out to film the Russian movie right now. I'm playing a Russian mob boss. No, that's a joke. Look at that. Look at that. Look at that. Look at that. Look. That strange thing is not having Internet, not having Internet because it's extremely isolating. You've been away from it for a little while. What are those walls? They're original property markers that Dutch settlers built in the 16 hundreds. They don't. They aren't used now like our property lines are on paper. The faithful crossing archive has been doing this for thousands of years and you can do this. This is all green underneath the stair, but it's just froze. That's the destination that we're going to go going down there. Oh my God, man.

Speaker 2:          01:54          nice. After being in the city for a long time, you get used to buildings and activity and all that stuff here, so it's sort of shocking. It's a stunning feeling to be in silence. I think we all need to change environments every once in a while, just so that we can get out of our own heads. You know, this is. This is a wonderful place.

Speaker 3:          02:19          Fuck.

Speaker 2:          02:25          Oh.

Speaker 4:          02:28          His practice was my grandfather and grandmother. That's so nice.

Speaker 1:          02:36          Mild winter for when it's not too cold.
