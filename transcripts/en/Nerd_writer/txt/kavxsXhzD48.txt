Speaker 1:          00:07          There are a few ways that you can build up tension in a movie scene through camera work, through pacing, and probably most commonly through music, like the music you're hearing right now in this incredibly tense scene from Steven Spielberg's, 2005 film Munich, except there is no music in the seat, but I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's back up.

Speaker 1:          00:37          We all know that movies have only two ways into your brain through your eyes and your ears, but if you've ever had the chance to edit a movie or a short film or even a small video, it quickly becomes apparent that when you're watching something, these two senses are weirdly interconnected. The visual side of film gets most of the attention because it's right in front of you and it's usually what you remember after a movie is over, but in many ways the visuals are simply the face of the operation. While the audio is actually the puppet master, the one that really holds them

Speaker 2:          01:09          power. Okay?

Speaker 1:          01:12          Let me show you what I mean. Take a look at this scene right here. So what does Spielberg want you to pay attention to? Hear these people walking by and this car passing, no, it's not what Spielberg wants. It's what I want. Since that was the sound design I just made for that shot. Here's what the actual shots sound stuff

Speaker 2:          01:49          still, besides

Speaker 1:          02:06          being infinitely better, it's easy to notice how the sound really affects what you see and from what perspective you see it. In my version, the shot had an omniscient third person point of view in the real version. As soon as the audio starts, you're placed in a perspective. The first thing you hear is a conversation from street level, so even though the long lens is fixed on Eric Bana, you know the moment is taking place on the ground. Then to drive the point home, you hear Daniel Craig singing the temptations and the vocal recording is close, intimate. Even though you never go inside the car, that's enough to put you there. Then the car that you're really supposed to pay attention to, the black one parks and the sound of it, parking jumps out in the mix. Just like you wouldn't hear Daniel Craig in that way from where the camera is. You wouldn't hear the car that clearly, but the sound design picks these things out to tell a specific story. Still stays shut up. The point here is that in film you really do see with your ears more than you think and sound doesn't mind. That image gets the credit because a key to the power of sound design is its invisibility. If dialogue sounds close than you are close to the person who's speaking it wherever they are. My brothers would choose my Papaya and my sister were both hanging. Okay, so back to the sequence. Oh yeah, forgot. No music

Speaker 1:          03:30          for a minute and 52nd seat is without music and almost entirely wordless. How does Spielberg and legendary sound designer Ben Burtt who gave the world this? How do they build the tension here? Well, burt does it by building a bed of constant noisy city ambiens. Then singling out and stringing together like beads on a wire. Key noises that tell the story. The background is that Eric Bana and his team are going to assassinate this man and his home by getting him to answer a phone that they've secretly installed a bomb in the string of isolated plot. Sounds goes like this. The car with the assassins arrives the dialogue of the targets wife and especially young daughter than their car pulling away signaling it's safe to move forward. Then the coins and rotary phone that will make the call then the priming of the detonator

Speaker 2:          04:23          and then wait, what was that

Speaker 1:          04:29          first moment of trouble comes in south. Up until now, the isolated noises represent the steps of the plan going smoothly. The truck passing by represents a break in that chain and a hitch in the plan. At this point, the ambience outside starts to take on some strange qualities. There's a high pitched whine like a train stopping on top of everything, and just like the moving truck blocks, the assassins view, the movers talking keeps them from hearing the daughter's car pull back up to the apartment. She plays a key part in the scene. So burt isolates her again, but not her voice this time. Her footsteps, which continue indoors in the apartment, the ambiance is quiet, and the really incredible thing about this scene is that Burton Spielberg build the tension not by working toward a great crescendo of noise, but by gradually subtracting elements. Once the daughter is up here, the danger can be signaled by a single sound. Okay,

Speaker 2:          05:20          perfect.

Speaker 1:          05:23          The important elements have been set up so well by this point that you could follow the rest of the scene without seeing it at all.

Speaker 2:          05:35          All right. Hello. Hello. Hello. I know

Speaker 1:          06:02          the climax of this scene brilliantly is silence, but it's the silence that works so well because it anticipates the noise of an explosion to come. At this point. The ambience has become really impressionistic and when it comes back in, it has echo and reverb. It's hurried footsteps and an anxious siren. The wholesale universe corresponds in a personal way to the assassins, to their feelings and their nerves, so it makes sense that when the final question is asked, it's the sound design that answers the off. I'm not sure what they're doing in film school these days, but if you have any interest in making movies

Speaker 3:          06:50          at all, you shouldn't attempt to make a scene like this. No dialogue, no music, just camera work in sound design. Once you finished it, watch the scene back. Close Your eyes and ask yourself,

Speaker 1:          07:04          what are your ears? See?
