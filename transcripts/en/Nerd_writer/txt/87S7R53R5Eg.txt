Speaker 1:          00:00          Okay, whoever put me on reddit out there, you know I got a bone to pick with you that the plan was to get subscribers at a torturously slow incremental, right over a period of decades. That was the plan. God, some people, you know what all I can say to you, it's coffee on a Tuesday and Vlog 42, so there's a feeling I sometimes get. Maybe you get it to. That happens. For example, when I come around a corner and all of a sudden I'm confronted by a sunset or at that moment in a movie when everything just falls into place, hairs stand up on the back of my neck and it chill, runs down my shoulders, times it freezes me in place, blanks my mind, and the feeling I have is one of astonishment. And Jimmy Stewart, my favorite actor, describes it like this.

Speaker 2:          00:53          Creating moments in movies. This I think is the important thing. Nobody knows exactly how it happened.

Speaker 1:          01:04          Turns out there's a name for this feeling. It's called freezer. It's a French word for cold chill, but really there is no English equivalent in French. It's pronounced like this free zone.

Speaker 1:          01:18          You can have free song with a person, someone you're attracted to, and if I had to guess, it probably happens most frequently in that nervous, flirtatious, almost unbearable time before any feelings are expressed outright. Okay, so have you ever spent a subway ride or a bus ride? Sort of on off looking at someone from across the train, someone who is beautiful, someone who strikes you and who you stupidly fall in love with, with the 10 minutes it takes to get from 30 Fourth Street to Union Square. You look at them as they look away and then you can feel their eyes on you as you look away, and then you sort of just wait there until you think it's safe to know this. I contacted freezing, freezing, freezing. Maybe it's just me. Whatever triggers it. We all get these feelings of freedom. One of the most common sources is music.

Speaker 1:          01:55          A study published last year in nature. Neuroscience showed that the moment in your favorite song when you experienced that chill, that feeling of free zone coincides with the release of the neurotransmitter dopamine into your brain opening. Makes you feel good and it's commonly released to reinforce or motivate biologically significant activity like eating or sex, suggesting that for some reason unknown to us, music is inextricably linked to our deepest reward systems, but there's something else. See, I also get a feeling of free when overwhelmed by a sad song. It's a chill, but a kind of consoling David here on a professor at Ohio State University and who runs the cognitive and systematic musicology laboratory. Awesome name has this to say about Sam

Speaker 3:          02:36          when a person is in a sad state, uh, uh, this hormone called Prolactin is released and it has a psychological effect, a consoling psychological effect. It's as though the music has put them into a kind of sham state of sadness. And the body has responded by releasing this hormone called Prolactin. And it's, it's like mother nature sort of wrapping our arms around you and consoling you and saying there are there. Everything's Okay and you have this kind of warm, fuzzy feeling. Extremely interesting.

Speaker 1:          03:09          But following from that, I want to pick up on an earlier point biologically, we really don't know why music affects us so powerfully. White gives us those feelings of Friesen or constellation or combination of both, but psychologically I think that music is embedded in each one of us uniquely strong along our memories in the way that Christmas lights are strung along a tree branch. To me, music is the raw or of beauty. It goes deeper and affects them more potent emotional response than any other art form. It's why when people ask, I say that the Beatles or the artists of any medium that have had the largest single influence on me on February fourth, 2008, NASA transmitted a song for the first time into deep space, the Beatles across the universe in the direction of the star Polaris, 431 light years from Earth. It's always been a sad song for me, if not for its swelling, drifting quality. Then because it gets me thinking of John Lennon and d, The idea of melodies like that dancing out into a silent and unfeeling universe gives me such a chill and then such a warmth that I do have the feeling of being wrapped in a blanket and I'm consoled for a moment or a minute of my humanity.

Speaker 1:          04:21          Welcome to everybody who's new. I'm so glad to have you. Really. This is a good example of sort of what goes on here. The vlog is a is a project of, of learning, but also of expression of trying to say something a thoughtfully and precisely. So on my channel page you can find social networks, things, twitter, tumblr, facebook, things like that. And seriously, thank you to that person who put me on Reddit. I owe you a beer or 20,000.
