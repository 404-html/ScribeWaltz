Speaker 1:          00:02          I think it's worth talking a little bit about Rosetta scientists, Matt Taylor, now infamous. Sure. Sort of what we do here at the nerd writer talk about morality, things like that, but if you think you've heard everything you ever want to hear about this subject, I'll give you a chance to get out now. Here's an awesome video of a dog trying to get a tater tot. I'll see you some other time. When the sand pepper thing happened a few weeks ago, I was drawn to look at it from an anthropological perspective, though I wholeheartedly agreed with the criticism of pepper. It was the form and impact of the response that fascinated me most in the wake of shirk gate. I just found myself wanting to know who was right and why. This is an important exercise, I think because it took all of three Internet seconds for arguments about this to devolve into Straw man attacks and character assassinations.

Speaker 1:          00:48          Soon as is so often the case in public discourse, everybody loses. The people who were criticizing Taylor's choice of shirt said essentially that images like these conserve to dissuade girls who might otherwise go into stem, science, technology, engineering, and math fields, because images like these perpetuate the cultural stereotype that stem is a boys club, just not something that girls do or as Mike over at idea channel set on his tumbler. The shirt was like the coloring on a poisonous frog. It's screams. Stay away to some maybe lots of people, particularly when Mike wrote about this in response to a tumbler. Ask that said, simply kill yourself. Not the most articulate way to advance your argument, but of course hate is a huge part of controversies like these. Not only for those who speak out against perceived wrongs, but even those who support those who speak out.

Speaker 1:          01:41          On the slightly more articulate side, you have commentators like the mayor of London, Boris Johnson who said there must be room in our world for centricity. Even if it offends the prudes and room for the vague other worldliness that often goes with genius, and then you have women across social media who said they weren't in the least bit offended by tailored shirt and after all it's just a shirt, right? Movies, TV, magazines, billboards are filled with exploitative images of female sexuality. Help Kim Kardashians probably did more to damage young girls image of themselves. Then the rest combined. Why are we crucifying Matt Taylor when everyone support something or other that has some kind of misogynistic undertone when none of us are blameless. First off, we're not crucifying Matt Taylor. We're trying to show how wearing a shirt like that on a global webcast might add to a culture of denigration of women.

Speaker 1:          02:33          Second, it doesn't really matter if some women aren't offended by Taylor shirt. What matters are facts, statistics like these statistics that show women earn 60 percent of all graduate degrees yet comprise less than 25 percent of the stem fields. Statistics that show women are far less likely to be published in peer reviewed scientific journals and just is unlikely to be cited when they are published. Maybe this is because women just like science as much as men, and if you're operating on that assumption, there's little I can tell you saved to suggest that maybe your assumptions are following from cultural norms, so invisible. They seem like insights about gender. Really the strongest emotion I'm feeling from the Internet in the wake of shirt gate is annoyance. Why do we have to cheapen this miraculous achievement of science and humankind with petty bickering about one man's stupid fashion choices, and I think this gets to the beating heart of the matter.

Speaker 1:          03:30          The dirty secret about sexism, racism, homophobia, prejudice is that it's pleasurable, it's pleasurable to assert your dominance within a hierarchy. You create splittable in the same way that winning at a sporting event is pleasurable. The feeling of being a winner of bettering someone. So when we think about issues like this, we have to keep in mind that what we're talking about is people's pleasure about taking it away from them rightly so. Yet, it will come as no surprise that there is reluctant to let it go here, as in any other instance of gratification in the active sense, prejudice is easy to condemn, but in the passive sense, it's far more insidious to tell otherwise kind and good hearted people that by doing nothing at all, they're perpetuating bigotry, discrimination, intolerance to require them to think about their actions and inactions may feel incredibly annoying. That's what it is to take someone's pleasure away, pleasure that's so normalized, so baked into our lives.

Speaker 1:          04:29          It's removal feels a lot like paint. I for one, think it's possible to hold two lines of thought in the mind at once to marvel at the unbelievable magic of the Rosetta mission and to lament the real contribution. However small of one man's shirt on a community of women who began at a loss, so the next time you feel annoyed at feminists or social justice warriors were Mike from idea channel. Take 60 seconds to think about whether in fact you feel annoyed or threatened. If it's the latter, ask yourself, what is it that I'm in danger of losing? Hey everybody. As I said at the beginning of the video, this is sort of what we do here. We think about moral issues, try to figure out what side we come out, and if we can't do that, we just try to get a better understanding of what the issue actually is. So thanks for watching. Make sure to follow me on twitter if you haven't already, I'll leave the link in the description and I will see you next time.
