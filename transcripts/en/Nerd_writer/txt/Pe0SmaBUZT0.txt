Speaker 1:          00:00          With other social media, I'm not sure, but I have no doubt that read it is improving my life. Reddit is hive, mind meets extreme democracy. It has the personality of a single human being, but it also reflects the personalities of millions of people all around the world. The uniformity of sensibility which can be seen on the front page where the most popular links are found becomes much more amazing. When I see that in the last month, reddit had $90, million, 946,972 unique visitor as hank green might say. I'm not going to get my mind around that. Speaking of Hank Green and the vlog brothers Nerdfighteria, their online community is a smaller but analogous example to the reddit universe. Nerdfighteria has its own events like the project for awesome and its own eccentricities like pizza John or sharpie face or peanut butter face. In the same way reddit has its own personality traits like its obsession with memes.

Speaker 1:          01:06          Video Games, the asked me anything feature or explain like I'm five. It has its own politics right now. For example, it's really invested in the NSA scandal and issues concerning Internet censorship. There are things it hates, like improper reddick. One thing I discovered this week is that reddit dislikes the creation of new means for my friend's 30th birthday. All his friends came together to make him into a popular meme. Um, it's called the sad elias meme and you can find the link for it in the description and submit anything to it that you want. Um, but when I tried to post our examples to read it, I found out that making memes of pictures that you've taken is a ban double offense. A banana bowl events in its countless subreddits, communities are more specific and cultish and like the dark side of Tumblr, Reddit has its fair share of porn and nasty shit.

Speaker 1:          02:01          Here's a perfect example of what I love about reading. This is a screenshot I took of an Ama with Lord. It starts with Lord answering a question about her seeming fixation with teeth in her lyrics. And she admits the obsession, but says that she hates dentists. And the first response is a Seinfeld reference. He's just a dentist. And your an anti identity. Then the second response is a comedic use of the transitive property of equality. Then we have a run of dentists and teeth related puns in which Lord rejoins the conversation with a pun of her own. Then someone makes a teeth and Lord Related Pun. Then someone finds an image of what that pun describes and then the next person shares the link to that artists other work. Remember, the comments aren't chronological. They're based on upvotes, which means that the order they appear in represents what redditors care about the most. In this case, clever references, puns, Fan art, and proper attribution. My favorite thing about reddit is that it's almost 100 percent content based though millions of people contribute to it. They do so anonymously. It's not mixed up with the pathetic local fame obsessions of facebook and instagram or the much larger fame obsessions of Youtube personalities like myself in the social media war between platforms that represent social and platforms that represent media. Reddit is the purest representation of the nobler side. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          03:38          Yes. So you probably want to know why I haven't posted a video and I don't even know how many months, lot of reasons. Laziness, disgusted with the form. Still a little bit disgusted with it. I'm 60 vlogs straight. I just was burnt out. I had nothing more to say, but mostly I just wanted to try other things. And one of the things I did try was making music. I just released an APP, uh, under my dj producer name, which is strum stick called new disguises. You can find it on spotify, soundcloud, itunes, wherever. Go listen to it. I spent a lot of time and effort on it and I'm, I'm proud of it. And it's something that I want to explore much, much further.
