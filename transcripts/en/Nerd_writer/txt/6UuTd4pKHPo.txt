Speaker 1:          00:15          Okay, so when the final scene of kill bill volume two by Quentin Tarantino, the eponymous villain bill tranquilized as the hero and the narrative to deliver a short monologue on his deep affection for comic book Superheroes, namely Superman Man of steel, he says, stands apart from other heroes like that man, Spiderman, etc. In that, unlike those others who have to don the costume, that they may become the hero, superman wakes as superman and must instead down the costume of clark at the mild mannered reporter from the daily planet who bill believes is superman's critique on the human race. Now, I don't know if tarantino believes this or it's just build who does, but being a huge fan of superman. I have to say that I can't agree with this characterization of the last son of crypto. Not too long ago when I didn't have to pay for rent or utilities or groceries or car insurance.

Speaker 1:          01:04          I used to read comic books. Every wednesday I go to the local comic book store and pick up new editions of the dc monthly. It's mainly the for superman titles, which were at that time still running action comics, superman, the adventures of superman and the man of steel. I was the only one of my friends who who read comics regularly and so it was sort of a thrill going there every wednesday because it was my first real sense of a community in which everyone was connected by their love of something. In this case, comics, and I've been a huge fan of communities like that ever since. Hence. Anyway, I became fascinated with superman probably for the same reason that a lot of young boys do. They get lost in that fantasy of unlimited physical power. superman could fly and it is an immutable fact of the universe that every boy everywhere knows exactly which combination of muscles to clench in order to take off into the sky or shoot fire from your eyes or see through walls.

Speaker 1:          01:51          Superman could do all those things. He could fly at. Super speed here, cries for help at great distances. He could pick up cars and hurl them like baseballs and how cruel where the stupid stupid laws of physics for preventing all this regular humans from doing such things when it's so easy to imagine. I don't think that those fantasies ever leave us, but as I grew older, the story of superman began to captivate me for different reasons. I think when we're young, we feel that to achieve those feats of strength would solve a lot of our problems. If I could only fly, if I can be the one who flies, then I could be special and important and all those abstract things. But as we make our way through adolescence, the complexities of the inner life begin to muddy those waters. The pen with which you have to write your own identity, gets put into your hand and you realize that no feat of strength or speed will help you with that task or superman.

Speaker 1:          02:40          The tasks would be even more difficult. His strength, his speed, his ability to fly, serve only to neutralize the physical so that the intellectual and emotional problems that plague all of us. how to love, how to be loved, how to know who we are, what we should want, how we should act, why we're here, appear only in starker relief. All his incredible power becomes an equally helplessness. Clark can't, can't wake up fried from these things just as neither you nor I can ignore the personal and ethical dilemmas that define us and it's ironic that in the comics, his feelings of being an alien from another planet of not fitting in or the cause of so much sorrow because it has these same feelings of sorrow for not fitting in, for not belonging, that make the rest of us human. Clark kent is clark kent. He puts on the costume to become superman and his as godly and perfect as we would have others believe that we are.

Speaker 1:          03:29          He saves the world from extraterrestrial existential threats, from villains of every shape, size and hairstyle. Good. He is as impotent as the rest of us when it comes to saving himself from the bumbling stuttering forever struggling condition of life and maybe clark kent is clark kent's critique on the human race, but to say that is simply to say that we are all continuously critiquing the human race. When we, for example, make total fools of ourselves in front of the lowest lanes of our lines and as beautiful as lois seems to clark, we know that she herself feels inadequate and the presence of superman, the great hero who is after all, only the same clark kent, who's invincible knees, can't seem to keep from going week in the presence of her kryptonite eyes. Some critique.
