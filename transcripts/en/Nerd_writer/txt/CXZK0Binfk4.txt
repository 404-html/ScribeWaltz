Speaker 1:          00:02          Like artists, filmmakers have a unique set of tools at their disposal, cameras, lenses, lights, microphones, music, and they use these tools to tell their story or set a scene. The director, David Lynch has of course the same tools as everybody else, but lynch manipulates more than just these physical instruments more deeply and more strangely than any other director I know of. He uses expectation as a tool. He wields expectation, the expectation that comes from what we know about film, about its history, the history of stories, and from our humanity with the same nuance and power and someone else might use light to create a variety of moods in a space. Today I want to look at how Lynch manipulates our expectations in a single scene from his masterpiece. Mulholland drive the guidance towards some interesting emotional territory. Let's scene I'm talking about is one of my favorite ever. The audition scene where betty played by Naomi Watts, tries out for a part in a small movie. We later learn is called the Sylvia North Story. The scene occurs about halfway through the film. Betty has come to Hollywood bright eyed and bushy tailed to be a movie star.

Speaker 2:          01:12          Oh, of course. I'd rather be known as a great actress than a movie star, but you know, sometimes people end up being both.

Speaker 1:          01:18          She's staying at her aunt's house where she discovers Rita, a woman who's been in a car accident and has lost all her memory or expectations for the audition have already been set up by much of what we've witnessed leading up to the scene. Betty doesn't seem to be a character with much internal depth or darkness or flatness of affect is even parodied in her very first scene at the airport where the dialogue is clearly overdubbed and fake. Okay, Irene, the day her blind kindness makes her vulnerable to exploitation. She doesn't even really care that a stranger is living in her aunt's house. So coming into the audition were feeling a couple of things were somewhat invested in Betty success. A basic expectation for any protagonist, but we're wary of some danger that may be in store because of her innocence and we have little or no expectation that she will impress with her acting chops.

Speaker 1:          02:10          Why don't you join woody over there and we'll play the scene, and of course the last thing to mention is that we've already seen this scene played out once before back at the house or a practice round, a tryout for a trial with betty and Rita. You're still here. I came back. I thought that's what you wanted. Nobody wants you here in this first reading. The scene is revealed to be trite, the dialogue cliched and melodramatic, but he's character rebukes her father's friend who is trying to seduce her for the second time it seems, and she moves closer and closer. As for threats become more stern, the two women can't even finish without laughing at the soap opera, quality of the script,

Speaker 2:          02:50          crowded, crying, cry, and then I say with big emotion, I drove. I hate us both.

Speaker 1:          02:57          So a universe of expectation has been laid out for the viewer. Will see in a second how those expectations will work as a trap. But at the start, everything in the audition room seems to reinforce what we already think, that people are about as stiff as the wood paneling that he's reading, partner what he looks like a star of all my children who spent a little too much time in the sun. The director is absent minded and laughable. So when the scene begins and woody corrals betty into his slimy grasp, what triggers first is our awareness of how vulnerable she is, and then when she pushes him away, we don't know if she's reacting as herself or as the character than woody moves to put his hands below her waist, and something incredible happens. A transformation so sudden that the viewer experiences whiplash as the critic George tolls notes were lured into engaging emotionally with the scene. When lynch triggers our expectation that betty might be exploited. We've dropped our guard a little, but it's already too much. We've surrendered enough so that when Lynch switches the bait, we're left in awe at what happens next. I.

Speaker 3:          04:06          It's not that difficult. He trusts you

Speaker 1:          04:27          all throughout the film. From the overdub dialogue on down, David Lynch has made us privy to the veneer of things. It's all curiously two dimensional and that puts us on our card. Since surfaces are what we get, lynch encourages us to examine those surfaces, always remaining detached enough for a disinterested, critical view of what we're seeing, but as with everything that Lynch does, this two dimensionality, this flatness is also a deception. I know you said you would entertain suggestions and that's all anybody here is asking you to do. What are you talking about? While we think we're on our guard, superior to the clawing emotions of Hollywood wish fulfillment, Lynch relishes dropping the bottom out, showing us just how unprepared and susceptible we are to emotions that our society, treasurers or deeply fierce in a scene that mirrors the audition. Betty and Rita go to a place called club. Silencio were a special show is underway. The host repeats again and again.

Speaker 4:          05:31          No,

Speaker 1:          05:35          and everything you're hearing he says is a tape recording. Expectations for the scene are made totally explicit. Then a woman comes out and sings, a truly heartbreaking Spanish version of Roy orbison's crying lynch pushes tight into her face in an extreme closeup, and the film begins to taunt us.

Speaker 5:          05:59          Hey,

Speaker 1:          06:10          what's at stake here? As in any movie is belief. Can the director of make you believe the artifice being presented to you? It's why directors use expectations. We incorporated from other films when two people lock eyes for the first time and the camera pushes in. That's love at first sight, and this is one way to generate belief. The definition of expectation is a strong belief that something will happen, but lynch goes a step further. In one way, he sets up an expectation than lures you into believing the opposite, so when the rug is pulled out, the audience is left, suspended, caught out, and captured, engaging fully with the terrifying nothingness that they were warned against. When the film finally takes it's hard, right? Turn revealing Betty's true story of pain and degradation. We're confronted again with the same feeling, believing we're going to get the key to the mystery, but instead are only sunk deeper into the dream and it's worth noting by the way that this all comes from an expectation that goes unfulfilled, but the audition scene plays the reverse feeling, and I think this is important. Instead of pulling the rug out to reveal an abyss, we come in fully prepared and analytical only to be dropped into a space of raw and honest emotion, even though we know it's active, even though we know this is a film, were entranced totally believing the moment, not because our expectations were fulfilled, but because they were subverted in a way that we didn't think was possible, and now I say with big emotion, I drove

Speaker 1:          07:57          not content with the dreams that Hollywood has been feeding us and mass for decades. David Lynch uses cliched expectation to move us into the spaces. Film has yet to go showing us the dangers and the hopes of believable.

Speaker 3:          08:17          I can't believe it.

Speaker 1:          08:24          That's a lot of lynch in a week period. Anyway, thank you very much for watching. Happy Wednesday.
