Speaker 1:          00:01          Okay, just got back from getting my hair cut. I thought I should probably tell you this before we start the blog. Just had two shots of rum with my Greek barber. He, um, took the shots, took the shots before the haircut, so he had those scissors up by my ears. Coffee on a Tuesday and block 37, three d movies, please just stop making them. So last week the new judge dredd movie came out and I was excited because it looked like the old faithful fair of gratuitous, slow motion violence and explosions. And the 1995 one with stallone is bowel scene. So I was ready to fandango some ticks when my friend and general sad news, Susan Elias told me that it was only showing in three days, only three d surely there has to be a two d showing somewhere.

Speaker 1:          01:05          So I think it's probably a good time to talk about why I don't like the troubling new trend of three d movies. I saw Avatar in three d, I saw coraline in three d, but I had to. I had to cut it off there because for both of those movies it was like after 45 minutes of finger started pushing into the center of my forehead. Maybe this happens to you too, and if it does, I can tell you there is a good reason and it has to do with evolution. So when we look at something, anything, there are a few things that are happening with our eyes first, like a camera. Your eyes are focusing at a certain distance. You can imagine. Focus is sort of like a flat plane that's moving away from you, depending on what you're looking at. Second and unlike a camera, your eyes are converging on a point, the object of your gaze. This convergence is the third point in a triangle in which the other two points are your eyes

Speaker 1:          01:57          triangle. For the hundreds of thousands of years that humans have been pottering around and for the many more millions of years in the history of eyes. The focus point and the convergence point have always been the same. But when you're sitting in a theater watching a three d movie, things are a bit different. The focus point always remains the same. Always say 60 feet where the screen is, but the convergence point is always changing. Depending on what the director wants you to see, the image might be 30 feet away, it might be 100 feet away. It's variable. Now we can do this, but it takes our brains a few more milliseconds to adjust to the change. This is why editing in three d films is a little bit slower than normal. As Walter Emerge, the legendary film editor and sound designer says, the CPU of our perceptual brain has to work extra hard, which is why after 20 minutes or so people get headaches, they're doing something that's 600 million years of evolution, never prepared them for. So if you're getting headaches in three d films, it's not your fault. It's Charles Darwin's fault. No, no wait. For years I've been decrying three d movies, not because of the serious and seemingly insurmountable focus convergence issue, but because I think that they perpetuate a false equivalency. I've never seen physical or illusory immersiveness is the ruler of what makes an immersive movie. Some of my favorite d movies are pretty three dimensional in their own right and nothing in those ever pops out of the screen. And this applies to gratuitous action movies too. I mean,

Speaker 2:          03:22          in order to catch him, he must become him.

Speaker 3:          03:32          Huge scissors cutting by my ears. And I was like his 30th cut at the day. So yeah.
