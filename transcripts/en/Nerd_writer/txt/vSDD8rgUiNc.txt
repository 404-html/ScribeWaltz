Speaker 1:          00:13          Okay, so there's a reason why it's not uncommon for audio files to use steely Dan records to test the sound quality of new speakers. The band is among the most sonically sophisticated pop acts of the 20th and 21st century, not just an audio fidelity, but in the complexity of their jazz and blues influenced songs. Today I want to break down one of my favorite steely Dan Songs, Deacon Blues, to show you what goes into making one of these things and we might as well back up and start at the intro, which I'll play again,

Speaker 1:          00:59          so that is one of the most recognizable intros and steely Dan's whole discography because it features a unique kind of court that's become a defining feature of their music. It's called the MIU major court. They called it that, a specific chord voicing that swaps a second degree note for a tonic note in a major chord. For example, if you take the c major chord, c, g, C, e, and you switched the second c for a d note, you've made a c major chord and you can hear a moon majors all throughout steely dance music like in the first chorus of black cow, the chorus of don't take me alive even right here in their first album on fire in the hole, and it should be noted that even though steely Dan squeezed the miu major for all it's worth this voicing has a history that goes all the way back to the twelfth century. The first time it was ever used was imperative. The greats, bitterroot ness. Take a listen to the beautiful second syllable of ness right here.

Speaker 1:          02:10          After these quintessential expressions of the [inaudible] major chord, the song dives into the first verse and we begin to hear the story of a suburban man in crisis. Fantasizing about becoming an alcoholic. Saxophone player. Instrumentation includes a Rhodes piano, a base that sort of floats along, carrying the rhythm. Larry Carlton steadily holding the Melody on Guitar, adding small frills which are hardly noticeable but extremely important and that they keep you from getting bored with the progression while complimenting vegans focus. You have an acoustic guitar in there too, and the Great Bernard Purdie, one of the best grooved drummers of all time. It's ordered.

Speaker 2:          03:01          Call me up

Speaker 1:          03:07          if you listen to Deacon Blues on headphones or speakers, and here just how good this music sounds. Every instrument has its own life. Each sound is thick and close up when it needs to be to achieve this Vegan and Becker at were explicit and following the example of legendary jazz producer and engineer Rudy Van Gelder, whose work at blue note records defined a generation of jazz music. Then Gilda was notoriously secretive about his techniques, but it's known that he had musicians played very close to the microphones to make his instruments sound warm and intimate. Anyone who's used microphones like the one I'm recording this narration on right now, knows that every microphone has a different quality of sound. Steely Dan's producer, Roger Nicole, described his extensive microphone collection in an interview once, and the point is that the band experimented exhaustively to get just the right sound for each instrument and vocal. You can hear right there that when we enter the second verse of Deacon Blues, a horn section comes in, composed by Tom Scott, who detailed in a Washington Post interview, how he modeled his horns after Oliver Nelson's or Kestrel style in which middle register horns slide against one another to create a thicker dissonant sound.

Speaker 1:          04:36          Vegan insisted Scott include nothing in the high end, and for this reason, when the bridge comes and the saxophone solo happens, personifying the main character of the song. It cuts through the mix like a lightning bolt. Because of the saxophone. Solo is such an important part of the song. Fagan and Becker searched for the right player to embody the sound. One night they turned on the tonight show with Johnny Carson.

Speaker 3:          05:04          Saw this

Speaker 4:          05:09          pete, Chris lead to work your saxophone and play what I feel very scotch whiskey all night long guy behind the wheel. And I thought you were talking about my life. So it was easy. I just had to take one tape.

Speaker 3:          05:35          Instrumentation on Deacon Boone

Speaker 1:          05:37          is immaculate and complex, but I think the lyrics are just as important. Deacon Blues tells the story of a midlife crisis, a man living a safe life in suburbia, looking through the glass said gamblers and wild ramblers seeing romance in the million lights of the city at night. He wants to be a saxophonist, drink scotch whiskey, die behind the wheels. Deacon Blues is a song of existential desire, a desire, as Becker says, for one of those mythic forms of loser, dumb and opposite to the routine middle register existence that stretches life to a thin film of small significance. Fagan and Becker have always been sardonic and Rye songwriters, they're smooth, jazzy feel stands in direct, almost mocking opposition to the punk rock sound that was gaining popularity at the same time, there's always a detachment in their songs and uncertainty about exactly who they're making fun of.

Speaker 1:          06:32          For example, they came up with the name of the Song Deacon Blues by recognizing how ridiculous it was to give sports teams majestic nicknames like University of Alabama's crimson tide. This mocking tone has turned a lot of people off to their music, but Deacon Blues I think contains a hidden earnestness in the lead into the first chorus. The narrator says he's ready to cross that fine line. The line between his existence and the one he wants to have. The song suggests that he's tried before and failed, but the music place these lines like he's taking a running headstart barreling toward a chorus that explodes into the fantasy.

Speaker 2:          07:10          I'm ready to die. For this reason,

Speaker 1:          07:34          I think you can look at Deacon Blues as a kind of literature. The story seems to be the central component here with each element of the music, filling out nuances and the main character is fantasy to the point where it's unclear in the last verse whether the narrator has actually done it or it's just been caught up in the dream.

Speaker 2:          08:00          I think listening to steely Dan with some good headphones,

Speaker 1:          08:02          rewards close reads like this. The layers are all there for you to examine one by one or simply enjoy in their combined expression. The quality is great. The composition is complex and the lyrics are interesting and dense for me. All of that adds up to a song that is going to last.

Speaker 1:          08:40          Hey everybody. Thanks for watching. I love steely Dan and I love this because I've never analyzed a song before and I love trying new things.
