Speaker 1:          00:07          It's hard to believe that 40 years ago, fleetwood Mac released it's masterpiece rumors because the record's still sounds as beautiful and pristine and new as it did in 1977. It's a timeless album as far as I'm concerned, a work of art that lasts, and that's really the goal, isn't it, for anyone in the creative arts to make something that feels alive months and years and decades after it's.

Speaker 2:          00:32          There you go. So what makes

Speaker 1:          00:38          rumors so good? Well, there are of course a lot of reasons. The skills of the individual band members, songwriting craft, the producers and engineers and the virtually unlimited budget and time that fleetwood Mac got from warner brothers following the release of their self titled Album, which was burning up the radio. That money in time means a lot to a band like fleetwood Mac who like the Beatles or Kanye west or frank ocean shines brightest in the studio where they can exercise minute control over every part of a song. Each track is like a sonic paintings. As Co producer of rumors can. Calais wants described it, and if you're wondering what he means by that, just take a listen to the difference between the demo of Stevie Nicks. Classic Song Dreams, which you're hearing right now in the final product.

Speaker 1:          01:44          This is how it worked with fleetwood Mac. In this case, Stevie Nicks wrote a beautiful piano melody and lyrics, and the band in particular, Lindsey Buckingham, spent the better part of a year adding and experimenting to create a rich, full bodied sonic experience. At its core, dreams is a pretty simple song that consists of only two quarts played over and over and over again. Next, presented the song to the band on a fender Rhodes piano. Buckingham added an acoustic guitar and Christine mcvie played a Hammond b three organ. Then Mick fleetwood added drums and John mcphee added Bass Guitar, a very hypnotic rhythm section. The base just alternates between F and g with some variations, and the standup part of the drums are these tapping high hats which run over everything throughout the whole song. That's the track fleetwood Mac laid down at the recording session in Sausalito, but the song was far from complete. For example, Buckingham and the producers were convinced that the drums were hypnotic enough, so they created a loop of eight bar loop of eight bars, eight bars, easier said than done on analog tape delay. Also edit a phaser to the high hat so that they would have a swishy thing, stick out later, Buckingham recorded and electric guitar part, adding those soupy licks that float through the verse and then tighten up in the pre chorus and eventually give way to an acoustic guitar in the course itself.

Speaker 1:          03:19          Buildup and release and change across the sections of a pop song or what make it compelling to the Listener Buckingham, who is a genius at filling in these kinds of colors and ideas, usually spur on more ideas. Calais describes in his book on rumors that when Nick's heard the new parts of the song, she had her own idea for background vocals and the pre chorus. She worked out the parts with Christine mcvie. They give the sad and dreamlike song and even more ghostly feel here. Take a listen.

Speaker 1:          04:01          The song, of course is about Lindsey Buckingham and it literally feels like it's haunting him. Stevie Nicks wrote it shortly after their breakup and as she says in the lyrics, she couldn't go on because Lindsey wanted his freedom. Now in loneliness, he has to dwell on what he had and what he lost. It's a cruel twist of fate that the song became such a hit that Buckingham had to spend the next 40 years singing it in concert. Anyway, at this point, the song was almost done. Nicks, Buckingham and big V created a tight three part vocal harmony for the quarter

Speaker 1:          04:39          and then they brightened up the pre courses with a vibraphone and the second chorus with a Conga drum. Those are both touches that you can barely hear and certainly don't think about much when you listen, but your brain registers the accents. When Calais mixed the song, he was careful to put every instrument in its right place and have a wide range of sounds from base to midrange treble. In the case of dreams, Calais pushed many of the instruments down to give them a little more base so that the high hat I talked about earlier with stand out as well as Nick's incredible. Also in the high end is Buckingham's whining guitar, a muddled longing response to the sharp poetry of the lyrics on rumors. Fleetwood Mac made perfect pop music. It didn't reinvent the wheel. It dip the wheel and liquid gold. These are concise, gorgeous songs, stressed up with multicolored sounds, but built on foundations of real emotion and real heartbreak. I think it's pretty safe to say that 40 years from now will still be listening to fleetwood Mac as John Keats once wrote. A thing of beauty is a joy.
