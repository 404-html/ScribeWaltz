Speaker 1:          00:02          I didn't get a tear. You lift sap. Yeah, that's what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna tear your eyes

Speaker 2:          00:18          out of the socket.

Speaker 1:          00:23          I'm gonna hit you, and you're gonna fall,

Speaker 2:          00:31          so this is a scene that came out of a nineties television show for children that may be hard to believe, but then again, a lot of the scenes that came out of the Ren and stimpy show pretty hard to believe. I'm a child of the nineties and no, I haven't seen many of the episodes of this show for well over a decade on rewatching the series. I was amazed by how much of the imagery was lodged deep in my memory, like the walls of tiers that welled up and were ejected out of stimpy's eyes in this episode called the little giant or the nerve endings that were excrutiatingly plucked out of Rennes gum sockets. And of course every gruesome yet painterly, extreme closeup that became a staple of the show and a few that followed along with the simpsons. Ren and stimpy was a seminal cartoon of the animation renaissance that hit TV in the early 19 nineties.

Speaker 2:          01:23          Whereas the simpsons was focused on sharp satirical writing, Ren and stimpy and its creator John Crikey Volusia. We're obsessed with unique, detailed and highly, very animation techniques. I think this is why the imagery of Ren and stimpy really leaves a mark on your brain. Quick Volusia was coming from a notorious starkey gene commercial animation in which the production of shows was fragment in an outsourced overseas to places like Taiwan and the Philippines. Plotlines were simple cliche and facial expressions were relegated to happy, sad and confused, and that's about it. There's a million versions of happy and sad and perplexed, and then there's all these other kinds of emotions that I've labeled, but you can draw them. I urged my artists all the time to never draw an expression that they've drawn before. So you're not allowed. Quickfire. Lucy found his sensibility, apprenticing and working cowork Ralph Bash in animation legend who was producing some of the only interesting commercial work of the 19 seventies.

Speaker 2:          02:23          He married the surreal often disturbing field bash key stuff with the dense energetic style of Bob Clampett cartoons of the 19 thirties and forties, like Clampett, quick flu seat. Wanted Ren and snippy to be filled with a new idea. Every second, we just take a look at these handful of frames from what's probably the best episode of the series, stimpy's invention, every frame. It's a completely new drawing. The scrip floozy once said of Clampett. It doesn't even look like it animates yet in real time. It works perfectly. It communicates a totally unique emotion, quick volusia his team or after with Ren and stimpy, two characters that actually got under your skin to characters that were so unique and dense in their movement and speech that you had to see a soul in them, however twisted that Sol was, and this quality has to be what makes the show so disturbing to every slimy, gunky, sweaty Harry Wu's had an unnerving reality and the show played on anxieties about bodily fluids at a time when the United States was at the height of its fears about the aids.

Speaker 3:          03:30          Derek, I believe that they should have separate hospitals so that the people that have a good go in there and not be in regular hospitals but that day, but

Speaker 2:          03:38          kids loved Ren and stimpy. It had higher ratings in its first year than fellow Nick toons, Doug and regret's combined. The creators maintained that they were on the kids side, spoonfed morals in school at home and on just about every children's show, animated or not. Ren and stimpy offered lesson free, Zany Gross, ridiculous humor. What quick flu see, believe was the point of cartoons anyway, and escape parents groups protested the show, but the audience had spoken and indeed in that first year at 35 percent of the people who watched ren and stimpy were over 18 years old. MTV started rerunning the first season at 7:00 PM instead of 11:00 AM viewing parties were arranged at college campuses and for good reason, like the adult swim cartoons that are in many ways it's spawn. Ren and stimpy mixed absurd character driven action with sly parodies of earlier cartoons, satirical and sometimes treasonous gags. Like when powdered toast man burned the bill of rights in the constitution to keep warm sexual innuendo that was off the charts and just genuinely terrifying moments. The police, Ren and stimpy didn't hold back on the insanity of its characters. Number of times. Wren goes completely psychotic and the honesty and quick for Lucy's voice acting coupled with the manic animation, including glaring abstract backgrounds and sound effects, is enough to pull the viewer into the cartoon and into that palpable distress.

Speaker 2:          05:12          The creators of Ren and stimpy had healthy disdain for the way cartoons had aggressively commercialized and commodified childhood with merchandise as simple well as simple as a log log, and they regretted that their peers were forced feeding ethical norms to their audiences on a weekly basis, so they made a show that brilliantly mocked these things, but I don't think Crikey, for Lucy's ultimate goal was to make something for adults. I think he wanted to create a show for kids to marvel at something that yanked your attention the way the old clampett cartoons did something as dark and seedy as the original fairytales, but uproariously funny and inventive in every frame to do this scrip flu seat, push the system to its limits and was eventually fired after the season. The show went on, but the richest episodes were during his reign in 91 and 92. The series masterpiece stimpy's invention took a full year to produce. Now maybe that was overkill, but at the same time, it's no doubt that obsessive attention to detail that burned ren and stimpy onto all of our brains

Speaker 4:          06:18          forever.
