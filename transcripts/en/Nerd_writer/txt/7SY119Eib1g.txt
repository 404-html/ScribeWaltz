Speaker 1:          00:03          It's amazing how much of our modern political morality is influenced by the philosopher John Stuart Mill and the mill wasn't the first person to champion individual freedom of choice, but the case he makes in on liberty, his most famous work is like a diamond of thought put most succinctly. He says that over himself, over his own body and mind. The individual is sovereign and if you want to understand the complex issue of who has the right to die, you have to start here because it's this principle of personal autonomy except in cases where opposes harm to others. That forms it's moral and legal basis. In American courts, at least the possession of that autonomy has become synonymous with the word dignity and words. Terms in this debate have a lot of importance. They framed the way we think of the question of doctor assisted suicide in the beginning.

Speaker 1:          01:00          It was called euthanasia. In 1938, Dr Charles Francis Potter, a unitarian priest and humanists founded the euthanasia society of America, the first group to seriously proposed legislation that would legalize mercy death. At least that's what the New York Times called the euthanasia society, didn't like the terms death and killing, and they preferred merciful release of course for much of the public, the term euthanasia was already a bit too close to Eugenics, something that the Nazis were going to make disgustingly clear in the next few years and the society wasn't doing much distinguishing itself and the words of its president, euthanasia was for born defectives who were doomed to remain defective. If that terrifies you, it should. So for those who saw a genuine moral imperative to help terminal sufferers and their life on their terms, it was an uphill battle. And that battle too was waged in words. In 1976, the euthanasia society of America changed their name to the Society for the right to die. In 1992, they changed it again to choice in died in 1993, another group form called compassion in dying. And in 2002, the former hemlock society changed its name to end of life choices. Finally, merging with compassion and dying in 2003 to form compassion and choices. You can see during a process of decades, a careful reframing of the debate as one about choice and personal autonomy.

Speaker 2:          02:32          I cosmo Kramer having just seen the movie the other side of darkness and not wanting to be in a coma like that lady in the movie hereby want Jerry Seinfeld to remove my life support, feeding machine, lung blower, et Cetera, et Cetera, et cetera. First

Speaker 1:          02:49          victories came in the form of advanced care directives or living wills and the court decisions were loaded with the language of autonomy and dignity to justify pulling the plug in the case of brain death. And then when the first physician assisted death, laws were passed, dignity was front and center again. Indeed such laws are often called death with dignity laws. Today, five states effectively allow physician assisted death and in each, the medication can only be prescribed when certain requirements are met. In Oregon, for example, you have to, among other things, be terminally ill with a fatal diagnosis of less than six months.

Speaker 3:          03:25          The day that I learned that I was terminally ill, that there was nothing that medicine could do to ameliorate even my symptoms. Uh, I decided that I wanted to live as long as I could, as best I was able and I want her to die with dignity with which I had lived.

Speaker 1:          03:47          It's an extraordinary issue. Physician assisted death. It's legal victories have been carved carefully from a complex and dangerous moral backdrop in a country where depression rates are as high as this one. It's not without risk to sanction any form of suicide. Death with dignity laws limit themselves to terminally ill patients exclusively because it's the only instance in which we can recognize irrational desire to end one's own life and all other cases. Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. Of course, opponents of physician assisted death don't see a moral right in any instance of suicide. A lot of those opponents fall on the conservative or religious side of the spectrum where there's also a split among progressives, particularly on the part of disability rights activists. When those seeking aid and dying lists the reasons for their choice reasons, such as the inability to live without help being a burden on their loved ones, things often refer to as indignities activist.

Speaker 1:          04:46          Point out that those with disability live with such conditions for their entire life. They say that physician assisted death laws can paint these kinds of lives as undignified and that creates a larger culture that the values the disabled. This is what happens when an abstract concept like dignity, a concept that has no fixed meaning in bioethics is invested with so much weight. 80 one percent of people who seek lethal medication do so because they worry about a quote, loss of dignity, and yet whether dignity is a property that can be lost. It's still a matter of philosophical debate. I should say now that physician assisted death is something that I support but not without a little hesitation, hesitation that's demanded. I think by the blurred boundaries of a moral question like this one. The objections posed by conservatives, disability rights activists and others must be taken into account. They don't negate. It's neat, but they do warn us that discussion across the table isn't for going to draft laws. As subtle as the issue is, mine is the morality of John Stuart Mill in 2015 at only the latest moment in our effort to understand the intricacies of individual liberty and at the heart of liberty is the right to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life and death.
