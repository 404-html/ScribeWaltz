Speaker 1:          00:00          Okay, okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Coffee on a Tuesday and Vlog 38.

Speaker 2:          00:14          Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:17          Laziness. Being unwilling to use work or energy. A lazy person sometimes called slacker couch potato. Nerdwriter bludger. Wait, no, that's wrong. Blood sugar is the furthest thing from laziness is dead serious. What the hell? I consider laziness to be the LEX luthor of my life. Which begs the question, was kryptonite really the weakness of superman or was it lex luther or was it love Ludovic? Van misstates, the Austrian economist wrote the expenditure of labor is deemed painful not to work is considered a state of affairs more satisfactory than working. Leisure is other things being equal. I prefer to travail people work only when they value the return of labor higher than the decrease in satisfaction brought about by the curtailment of leisure. Is that true? I mean, I remember those days in college when I had a long paper test to finish and I thought to myself, if I just finished this, I'll have three or four days where I won't have to do anything and it will be glorious. I was living for the gaps as it were, those times when I could just be lazy and even now having worked at a real job for some time, I'm beginning to learn the meaning of that classic Loverboy Song.

Speaker 1:          01:29          Don't get me wrong, I have a great job, but it's still work and there are times when I find myself daydreaming about my couch, my boxers, Jersey shore. I've always felt like this laziness wasn't me, like it was some disease I had contracted, like my bad work ethic was the result of being spoiled as a kid or the coddling of contemporary society. I felt this way because I couldn't change it. I couldn't excise it from myself. All I had was my fear of failure to fight it, and when you graduate from school, when the educational system spits you out, it dawns on you that if you don't make money, you're going to become homeless. Of course you might be lucky enough to have parents to help you out part of the way, but unless you're inheriting a large fortune, you're going to have to figure it out for yourself.

Speaker 1:          02:13          At that point, you can still use the fear of failure to guide you or you can use the disappointment of others, or you can find something that you really love that doesn't seem like work at all. Never underestimate the power of not wanting to disappoint your mother. Hard work is considered by almost everyone a virtue, but laziness may in fact be our nature. A lot of animals are just lazy. They only get what they need and they just lounge around for the rest of the time, but theories abound which give Leisure and laziness more credit. For example, in ecclesiastics 14, it says, wisdom is good together with an inheritance or Schopenhauer, the man to whom nature and fate have granted the blessing of wisdom will be most anxious and careful to keep open the fountains of happiness which he has in himself and for this independence and leisure, or necessarily the point is that leisure, those hours when don't have to work for our bread may be the best for inspiration. In fact, the modern economy echoes that sentiment somewhat. The virtuous phrase, work hard has almost totally been replaced with worksmart or work uniquely many like those in the web development community. Use Leisure to their business advantage. Be sure the terms, Leisure and laziness have nuances of their own. Suffice it to say that complete laziness won't sustain and total leisure doesn't exist in the realm of practical life. It comes down to a dualistic mantra. Be Happy, make money, avoid.

Speaker 1:          03:37          Okay, daily grace. We both know you're getting my tweets to collaborate, so what I'm going to do now is enlist all the viewers watching this video to tweet daily grace to collaborate with the nerdwriter. Why? Well, because I'm handsome because I'm charming because I'm well at the moment I'm Gassy, but I don't consider that powerhouse in the kitchen. Mediocre at basketball, the most sonorous high fives you've ever received. I have a heart of gold and I desperately need surgery. I've been known to give massages. No, no, that's wrong. I. I like massage. Can you give me a massage?
