Speaker 1:          00:15          Thanksgiving wasn't always like it is today, the domestic family meal football, the parade leftovers, black Friday like Christmas. It used to be a holiday of festivals, outdoor revelry, and drinking too much like today's Halloween. In fact, children would dress up in costumes and go begging for money or treats. If you were growing up in 19th century, New York City, you might see a group of crossdressers called the fantastical marching the city streets ridiculing authority figures. It wasn't until the mid 18 hundreds that Sarah Josepha Hale, the godmother of Thanksgiving as we know it, started writing her famous editorials in goatees magazine, recontextualizing the holiday as a domestic occasion, one in which distance sons and daughters returned home for a family feast. She urged governors and presidents to adopt the last Thursday in November as a national holiday, and her letters shake with notes of urgency and the spare is the country slid to civil war.

Speaker 1:          01:15          Thanksgiving, she hoped might hold together under the banner of brotherhood and gratitude of Fragile Union. It didn't work, of course, but in 18, 63, president Lincoln did make Thanksgiving, a federal holiday. The point of pride for Union states then for the rest of the country as it rebuilt after the war, Hail Lincoln and others of that period effectively rewrote Thanksgiving as something that happens in doors with families, a joyful reuniting but no longer have rawkus. The tectonic changes of the industrial and commercial revolutions were pulling families apart. They felt threatening to weaken the ties and values that grounded the nation over the next decades into the 20th century. Thanksgiving lost its tolerance for begging children and drunk and marchers and picked up new traditions like annual football games and the macy's Day parade teachers taught the story of Thanksgiving to their students, many of whom urge their immigrant parents to celebrate the national ritual, a way of stirring patriotism, and as with all forms of assimilation, foreign cultures are both absorbed into and erased by the dominant culture. The thanksgiving Turkey and its many side dishes are a great metaphor for these twin tendencies and many brought dishes from their own cultures into the feast to remember their diverse pasts. As long as the Turkey rained. Overall,

Speaker 2:          02:41          this is all to say that traditions like Thanksgiving aren't natural by any means. They're invented and at the time of their invention they call to a past that's not really there and imagined past a constructed authenticity that serves the purposes of the president. Indeed, even the awareness of such traditions is a relatively modern phenomenon, anchoring points for a culture in constant and progressively more rapid change. There's a lot in the DNA of Thanksgiving worth holding onto, but there's a lot of which we'd be better off without a rosy and false account of our early settlers, friendship with the native Americans and ideology of female domesticity and anachronistic remnant of the separate spheres. Way of thinking that said, a woman's rightful place was at home in front of the stove. The assimilation of other cultures, races, and classes into a largely white and largely Protestant system of thinking. For me, the core of Thanksgiving is family. The family I was born into, the family I chose, the community I live in and the nation that gives me the freedom to think through and if I want criticize it's values. These days in the wake of terror around the world, what our worst reactionary tendencies are flared by those far too willing to stoke fear

Speaker 1:          03:59          at anchor. It's worth remembering, I think just how many different families we all belong to. We may be celebrating in separate homes, but in reality, each family in America blends into the next. If the history of Thanksgiving shows us anything, it's that holidays like these are open to revision as Americans. Thanksgiving is ours to reframe just as the country is. That's an important responsibility for all of us. Have responsibility for which I give. Thanks.
