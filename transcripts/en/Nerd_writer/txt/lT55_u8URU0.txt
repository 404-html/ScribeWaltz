Speaker 1:          00:01          In movies or TV, whenever one character says to another character, can't we just go back to the way things used to be? It's usually a sign on the part of the writers that that character has yet to face up either to reality or to themselves. The cliche is offered up as a solution. Some trauma has passed parties that were enraged or hurt or a mistaken one to forgive or heal or apologize. They want the bad times to give way to good times, but only on the pretense, the false pretense that the bad times never happened. This is a kind of red herring of reconciliation. We know that trauma can be repressed, but it can't be erased. Lasting reconciliation is achieved by emotional self awareness, by embracing the change agents of trauma and how they irreversibly reorganize elements of personality, identity and social reality. This idea, the idea of embracing our wounds, our brokenness is manifested quite politically in the Japanese mending practice of consumer, literally meaning golden joinery.

Masa broke one of his prize Chinese tea bowls, so he sent the item back to China for repair. What he got in return was his bowl mended with bulky and ugly metal staples dismayed, Yoshi, Masa prompted Japanese craftsmen to search for a more aesthetic means of repair.

Speaker 1:          02:14          The Art of keen, Suki became famous for turning broken objects into pieces more beautiful than the original product. There are even rumors of people breaking their own possessions on purpose so that they can be mended using this lovely technique. The philosophy here follows from abroad or Japanese aesthetic called Wabi, Sabi that finds beauty not in traditional western ideals of symmetry or geometry, but in Buddhist concept of impermanence and imperfection. The fracture is on a ceramic bowl. Don't represent the end of that object's life, but rather an essential moment in its history. The flaws of a shape aren't hidden from inspection, but in blaze with golden significance. Maybe Hemingway had consumed pee on his mind when he wrote that famous line from a farewell to arms. The world breaks everyone and afterward many are strong in the broken places. The amazing art of consuming a fading art like so many handcrafts symbolizes the truth.
