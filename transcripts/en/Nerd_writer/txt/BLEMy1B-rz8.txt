Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello, all you haymakers and hamburgers, coffee on a Tuesday and Vlog 58

Speaker 2:          00:17          with

Speaker 1:          00:17          few exceptions. I don't really read much contemporary fiction. It's been that way for awhile. If you take a look at my bookshelf, what you'll find is a collection of almost exclusively classic author like Henry James Proust. Hugo came up now because steinbeck balls and of course shakespeare. Now there's an irony to this because many of these books were assigned to me as part of my secondary school curriculum, but in almost every case, what I read look more like this than this. How many windows do I have over there? In one sense, I'm glad these books were assigned to us because now when I actually want to read them, I know exactly where to look. Actually, I sometimes suspect that that's the reason why they assign them to us in the first place to map the intellectual geography of what is important and lasting in literature. I mean, what other reason could there be?

Speaker 1:          01:03          I remember rereading Hawthorne's, the scarlet letter a few years back and thinking whoever gave this to me when I was 15 must have been insane to think I had the mental acuity to process one of, if not the premier novel in American literature at that age. I barely had the mental acuity to process the matrix realities, mo doubt, reality, dreams will destiny. Now, I use the word classic in a pretty broad sense for me. It can be anything from homer and Shakespeare to whack and Philip K, Dick Essentially I'm using as my measure a kind of collective academic agreement about what is great, what is influential or pressure or complex. Really whatever penguin has made a version, but perhaps I'm wrong to let penguin be the arbiter of what is and isn't a class taking a more precise definition. I've turned to the great ts Elliot who in his essay what is a classic contends that there are actually no classics in all of English literature, even such greats as Milton Shakespeare, to whom there are perhaps no superiors in style and maturity fail to achieve classical status because of the language itself.

Speaker 1:          02:08          Had not yet reached mature. A common style writes Eliot is one which makes us exclaimed, not this is a man of genius using the language, but this realizes the genius of the language. We do not say this when reading Shakespeare or Milton because we are always conscious of the greatness of the man and the miracles that he is performing with the length. Indeed Elliot holds that a universal classic comes at the confluence of a maturity of mind, manners and common style that Elizabeth and poetry, as I've said before, is more invented by Shakespeare then fully realized by him that the manners of the period were more provincial than universal elliot points to Virgil's Aeneid as the quintessential classic and to Latin as the quintessential classical language for consolidates. The greatness of a mature predecessor and is the common ancestor to which all of the European languages are air.

Speaker 1:          02:58          It is by the standard of Virgil and Latin that old modern works are judged and it is a necessary standard for English literature to Excel and not be consumed by chaos while being perhaps impossible for it to achieve. Though we must soldier on imagining that we can't, it's the idea of a common style that interests me. Most. Common style is something that marks a classical period, whether in Elliot's larger sense or in a lowercase sense, so to speak, of classics within English, poetry and prose. It doesn't mean as Elliot says that the best writers of such a period are indistinguishable, but rather that there are differences are more subtle and refined like the shades of tastes between superlative wine and it is also a mark of a classical period that the era before it is branded with eccentricities as writers stab in the dark towards something not yet universal and eccentricity to as the classical period passes away and originality becomes more valued than correctness.

Speaker 1:          03:56          I don't know what period we find ourselves in today, but eccentricities a kind of agitated free for all seems to describe it. This of course reflects the culture at large. Not that we are devoid of great authors, but rather have great movements of a common style and every time I sit down to write, I find it impossible not to aim at classic. Now, maybe this suggests a Hubris in me or maybe the fact that I'm self conscious about it suggests a deficiency in the period as a writer and reader in 2013, I engage in no revolt against the current state of English literature. It's too heterogeneous now. Even for that, I only wished to navigate that old and shamefully pass a river, which from the mountain of homework passes through all my heroes and me too.
