Speaker 1:          00:02          The Art of performing magic is really the art of managing attention up here. Look at the car at three to three, three, three. It doesn't matter. The general rule of thumb is that when a magician says that something doesn't matter, the opposite is usually true. For example, a couple of minutes ago when David Blaine flipped three more cards into what everyone else thinks is a pile of 10, then asked to read to put them over his heart. The only thing that matters is that Jimmy Fallon chooses the number three from this forced flourish so that when Blaine says that three cards will magically fly from his deck into creeks hand, the 13 cards will be there and everyone will freak out. 10 zero. Did you catch it that time? Ten, 10, zero. There's three and there's four more. Now there's 20 cards.

Speaker 1:          01:05          This is a great trick from David Blaine and it functions on a simple concept which all magic depends on selective attention. The idea that the eyes and the mind can only focus on one thing at a time. This principle is something that magicians have known for centuries in the earliest known book of Magic and English Hocus pocus. The author includes in his four required skills for magic tricks such gestures of body as may lead the spectators eyes from a strict and diligent beholding of his manner of conveyance. A few hundred years later, scientists began conducting tests on selective attention like this one from deckland serve owned from 1983, which asked subjects to count the number of times the white shirted players pass the ball back and forth and this in other tests like it. A majority of people, more than half fail to see the woman with the umbrella walking directly through the middle of the scene.

Speaker 1:          01:56          The important thing to note is that selected the tension is something that organizes our entire experience as human beings, not just our vision. I mean, David Blaine may be distracting Jimmy Fallon and the roots when he loads these extra cards into the pile, but what's more amazing than the slight of hand is that he's doing it in exactly the place where everyone is looking and this shows just how powerful selective attention can be in magic. Manipulating attention is fun. It's what we expect, but it's not the only place we find this kind of activity. Let's take a look at another trick. Are you watching closely on Sunday, November 27th, The New York Times published a comprehensive piece of good journalism detailing country by country, the empire of business interests that Donald trump has around the globe and how they might conflict with his job as president. The story was at the top of the front page.

Speaker 1:          02:46          Then at around 1230 that afternoon, trump tweeted this, in addition to winning the electoral college in a landslide, I won the popular vote. If you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally, make no mistake. This is a kind of magic trick like David Blaine, like any magician, Donald Trump is using selective attention for his own gain. He's misdirecting sucking all the air out of a story that he wants you to forget. Mr [inaudible] is not new to politics. Politicians have been manipulating our attention for years. I mean when the public asks a question politicians figured out long ago that rather than actually answer it, it's much, much better to change the question. When you address negative publicity on its own terms, you end up with stuff like this.

Speaker 2:          03:31          People have got to know whether or not their president is a crook. Well, I'm not a crook. I earned everything I've got.

Speaker 1:          03:38          Instead of moving attention away from the question of his criminality, Nixon aim the focus directly onto that issue by denying it outright. A better magic trick is something that happened a few years earlier when Vietnam war protests were gripping the country in the 19 sixties, politicians and elites who supported the war didn't address the protestors actual concerns about the legitimacy of the conflict. Instead, they reframed the antiwar protests as anti troop protests, and this political sleight of hand has proven really fruitful and undercutting protesters, not just the Vietnam War, the Gulf War, and the war on terror.

Speaker 3:          04:16          Scare every American to find a way to thank the men and women who are defending our freedom.

Speaker 1:          04:23          I'm Donald Trump. Takes this a step further. He uses twitter to maneuver attention away from negative press, but he doesn't reframe the debate so much as distract the country with statements so glaringly false and controversial, but the media is forced to expend its energy on refuting them or covering them because they have to because the winning president elect saying without evidence that millions of people voted illegally will get ratings because when the president makes a force of the presidency, that is in some sad way newsworthy, and then when you're done covering that, a new tweet comes in that says flag burners should perhaps lose their citizenship or be sent to jail for a year. I mean, it's really amazing. The attention goes where he wants it to go and without the pressure of sustained focus. The Chairman of the House oversight committee is free to brush the real issue. The one we all forgot about aside, I think you can expect this kind of thing for the next four years. Expect every substantive criticism to be met with a ridiculous tweet. It's time for all of us to start thinking of our own attention as a limited and valuable resource because when you do, you can be a little more certain that the card, your choosing. It's actually yours. Stop.
