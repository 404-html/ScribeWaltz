I've also started a new tumbler called 52 bucks, 52 weeks in which it's exactly what it sounds like.

I figure what's the use of having an appropriately full plate on the back? Mom,

Speaker 3:          01:00          I just press the red bugging me. Recording. Yeah. Okay. One more time. Ready? Shelly, are you the one? I know it's videoing now. You're videoing. Ready? Cool. Lily. Lily, are you ready?
