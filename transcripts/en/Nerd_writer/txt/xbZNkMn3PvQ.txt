Speaker 1:          00:02          Mm,

Speaker 2:          00:19          I

Speaker 1:          00:19          think it's okay to start my analysis of Guillermo del Toro's, Pan's labyrinth with a spoiler Ofelia the main character. She dies at the end. I feel fine doing that because del Toro does the exact same thing with his movie. The first shot of Pan's labyrinth is the ending and it's also the first way in which deltoro complicates that epic, but before we get into that, a few things about fairytales, but for most of us, the authoritative source for fairytales is Walt Disney and that's no accident. Disney set out to claim that authority when he made films like snow, White Cinderella, sleeping beauty by adapting folktales in the public domain and copywriting the adaptations still because film was a relatively new medium. Capturing the authority he wanted require Disney to remain faithful to the original versions of these stories popularized by Charles perrow and the brothers Grimm. He made the transition from print to cinema as smooth as possible for the audience even going so far as to begin his movies.

Speaker 1:          01:24          With the opening of a book, Disney was smart. His films are now regarded as classics, and yet by remaining so faithful to the stories 19th century antecedents, he inherited and furthered their 19th century morality, a conservative patriarchal value system in which the prince always comes to save the helpless heroin, a value system that was antiquated. Even then in this way, Disney limited the kinds of things a fairytale can do in Pan's labyrinth. Guillermo del Toro attempts to explode these limitations and he does so by recontextualizing. These stories, instead of pulling from a single authoritative source, del Toro pulls from a huge number of sources, giving none precedence over the others and letting them all play against one another to create meaning. The film tells the story of the little girl Ofelia and her mother Carmen, as they go to live with the hyper fascist to captain vidal.

Speaker 1:          02:21          Five years after the Spanish civil war, the Dallas trying to sniff out the last remnants of rebellion in the mountains, awaiting his child's birth by Carmen. While Ofelia becomes ensnared in a magical quest after a fond tells her that she is the lost princess of an underground realm. From here, the story spins out into two parallel narratives, the magical quest and the political drama. Crucially, neither of these narratives becomes reducible to the other. Del Toro makes a point of this by entwining them in ways that makes any totalizing explanation problematic. At the end of the film, for example, we get seems to be the nail in the coffin for the magical quest, but dol approaches Ofelia speaking with the font and when the camera cuts to his point of view, the font is not there. This appears to be solid evidence for those who read Ofelia's quest as a coping mechanism for her set life, but if we back up, we can see how Deltoro complicates that reading by remembering that the dol has just been drugged with a heavy dose of sleeping medication. In other stories, drug induced hallucinations are used to explain a way why people see the supernatural, but in Pan's labyrinth, it's the opposite. Del Toro uses the device to destabilize our trust in Captain v Dot Dallas point of view here and elsewhere. The film refuses to obey our desire for an all encompassing explanation. Of course, disobedience is a major theme in this film

Speaker 3:          03:53          I see,

Speaker 1:          04:00          whereas in many fairytales, disobedience is the act that sets the story in motion here. Disobedience is framed as a vital and important quality. There's the disobedience of the rebels who seek to free Spain from the grip of fascism, the disobedience of Mercedes, who works with the rebels, and of course the disobedience of Ofelia who by turns questions and disregards the commands of her mother, the captain and the font, but the most effective and I think impressive disobedience here is that displayed within the very text of the movie, and this is where del Toro's intense referencing comes into play. The name of the game here is multiplicity, undermining a single authoritarian master narrative like those champion by the dol and fascism in general by setting up a network of inter texts that make meaning a matter of choice. I think of all the linking references in the pale man scene, for example, you have the ogre himself nodding to other child eating ogres and other mythologies like krampus.

Speaker 1:          05:00          It also refers to the Greek Titan Kronos, who devoured his god. Children in order to like fascist Spain, keep the young from replacing them and coming into their own. Also, it should be noted that Kronos is the title of Del Toro's first film, one of many things that links his body of work together. The table itself links back to the banquet scene earlier in the film, putting the Pale man in the same position as the Dell who will go on to kill a child. The pile of shoes link forward and we'll go on to recontextualize Ofelia's red shoes itself, a link to the wizard of Oz and the 1948 film by Powell and Pressburger recontextualize as images reminiscent of the piles of clothes from Nazi concentration camps and the scene itself functions as a metaphor for how beauty, like say, the beauty of old fairytales can enchant us into certain lines and ways of thinking that may not be in our interest.

Speaker 1:          05:54          Here you have constructed a vast network of citation that reaches elsewhere in the film and outside of it. The lines of that network are for the viewers to follow as they see fit. Del Toro laces these references together with camera work and editing to achieve a narrative momentum that's undeniable when you watch his movies. It was the purpose of the doll like it is the purpose of all authoritarian regimes or patriarchal moralistic fairytales to limit the number and kinds of stories that can be told from a set of facts or events. Indeed limited to one story. The only thing for us is to disobey you. In old fairytales. The stories were closed out in contained by two words. The end adult touros genius is to use perhaps this most formulaic genre of all and disobey our expectations and how it should unfold and how it should end. The rebels capture and kill the doll, but Spain will continue under authoritarian dictatorship for 30 years. Ophelia is murdered, but completes her quest and returns to the underground realm. Or you can read that as a poetic ending to a sad story, but happy ending to a fairytale or Ophelia's final choice of the story she wants to tell for and about herself. Of course, she doesn't have

Speaker 4:          07:22          to choose at all. No single story could contain her for even when she returned to the world of magic, it has said she left small traces of her time on earth, visible to those who know where

Speaker 5:          07:38          and how to look.

Speaker 1:          07:49          Hey everybody, thanks for watching. Pan's labyrinth has been one of my favorite movies since I saw it in theaters, so this was just a blast to make.
