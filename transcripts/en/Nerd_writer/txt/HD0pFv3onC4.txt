Speaker 1:          00:00          Coffee on a Tuesday and Vlog, 43. Minimalism is everywhere.

Speaker 1:          00:24          It's a style in which the simplest and view as elements are used to create the maximum effect and you can find minimalism and almost every art form or kind of media in the visual arts and music and literature. You can find it in architecture and expensive food, but most importantly, I think for the current age, you see it as defining trends in advertising and design. The influence here is in good part Japanese where Zen Buddhist concepts of simplicity inform living spaces and ways of life and not only for its aesthetics, but also as a moral imperative to respect the quintessence of thing. No filmmaker, for example, did a better job of capturing this. Then Yasuhiro, whose films you should watch immediately after this video is over. Of course, camera always placed low to the ground. Ozu films have a two dimensional quality exhibiting what is essentially an organization of geometric shapes.

Speaker 1:          01:09          I never forget the film frame itself is directing. This for me is the key of minimalism. It's a movement of organized geometry. The relationships of shapes inside what is essentially just a bunch of rectangles, the TB screen, the computer screen, the film frame, the Youtube player, the billboard, the street sign, or the page. A more recent influence is the Dutch dish style movement or neoplastic system as Pete Mondrian, whose paintings you will most certainly recognize said it is possible that through horizontal and vertical lines constructed with awareness but not with calculation led by high intuition and brought to harmony and rhythm, that these basic forms of beauty supplemented if necessary by other direct lines or curves can become a work of art. As strong as it is true and it's true, the geometrical organization is one of intuition influenced perhaps by symmetry and weight in photography by the rule of thirds, but finally achieved by a feeling.

Speaker 1:          02:00          This feels right, comfortable balance. Take my end screen. For example, I must've spent and hour making my newt millimeter changes to the elements that you see here, which when paired down look like this, three rectangles in a circle, inside a larger rectangle trying to achieve a kind of harmony between the distances and empty blue space. Maybe it was an hour wasted or maybe we are more attracted to pieces of design that work in the minimal sense. Maybe in the full appraisal that you take of my work, the end screen design, the framing, the text, the pictures reinforce or intensify the reaction you have to the content. The rise of minimalism is symptomatic of a chaotic culture, bombarded with information. The organizational impulse is amplified and we're drawn to messages or products that help us to assemble disparate data into a coherent whole. So instead of this, we want this and instead of these we use this, life is marked with contradictory, but balancing trends. Tendencies that aim in their way to harmonize the of maternity minimalism is a reminder and a welcome one that in a fog of appointments and facebook notifications and different types of shampoo and homework and real work that you can breathe

Speaker 2:          03:19          right.
