Speaker 1:          00:02          Would you care for someone for sure have to do just answer my questions with. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:13          A few years ago, a friend and I went to the scientology complex in Los Angeles to see what the religion was all about. We were curious. I talked about it actually one of the first episodes of the show. We were touring around the facility, introduced to some very nice members and given personality tests. The test, which is officially called the Oxford capacity analysis, though it has no connection with Oxford University or any accredited institution, was more intense than I thought it was going to be. An included about 200 questions. A few of which are actually reproduced exactly in this scene from Paul Thomas Anderson. 20 12 film the master do linger in bus stations for pleasure. You muscles precedents for no reason to past failures bother you. Would you like to be told what to do? Do you find interest in other people? I often consumed my scientific usually truthful to other unpredictable.

Speaker 2:          01:10          Yeah. This processing scene from the master is, in my opinion, one of the best sequences in one of the best movies of the last 10 years. It's simple, brilliantly acted and hypnotic, which is no mistake on the part of the filmmakers if you're interested. The scene offers some real insights into how the religion of scientology functions. Though PT Anderson has always been careful to say that the master is not an exact retelling of scientology's founding. The similarities in character, feeling and technique are hard to deny. For example, this scene, the processing seen bears an unmistakable resemblance to a vital activity within scientology called auditing. The term auditing comes from a word which means to listen in auditing. The person running the session is called the auditor. The person receiving auditing is called a pre clear because he has not yet been cleared of his reactive mind.

Speaker 2:          02:00          In the master seen Lancaster Dod played by Philip Seymour. Hoffman is the auditor and Freddie played by Joaquin Phoenix. Is the pre clear like dod does here. The auditor in scientology asks questions of the pre clear with the goal of reading him, of Ngrams, the term for traumatic memories stored in what's called the reactive mind. The auditor does this by helping the preclearance relive the experience that caused the trauma. When the pre-cleared has a cognition or a positive realization, the session is completed. If this seems a little like psychoanalysis to you, that's because it is. When l Ron Hubbard, the founder of scientology, laid down these methods in his book dianetics. I think he genuinely believed that he had devised a new kind of psychotherapy, something that was scientifically rigorous and effective. Of course, as we know, dianetics is not scientifically rigorous. It has been repeatedly rejected by all mental health communities as a pseudoscience, which it is, but as we see in the master, there's no doubt that the process of auditing can cause and effect.

Speaker 2:          03:01          Where's your mother infringement back to this time in the processing seen dod gets ready to admit to a series of past traumas including the death of his father, the institutionalization of his mother, his incestuous relationship with an aunt and the Times that he killed people in war. He uses these to access the primary end, Graham of the session, Freddy's abandonment of the love of his life back home, like in psychoanalysis dot achieves this by talking, by initiating and exchange that attempts to unlock things that are repressed or hard to face, but the methods used are different as as long been believed by. It's critics. Scientology auditing goes further than psychoanalysis or talk therapy because it utilizes a form of command. GNOSIS. Say Your name. Say it again, Freddy. Well say it again. Freddy quilt and again Friday. Quell. All throughout the dod works to bring Freddy under his command and the first part which is structured a lot like the personality test. He asks them a series of relatively simple yes or no questions getting freddy used to this call and response pattern. Utilizing repetition to induce a relaxed and focused state. In past failures bother you know, do your past failures.

Speaker 3:          04:24          No.

Speaker 2:          04:26          Do you pass values bother you?

Speaker 2:          04:31          No. Do your past failures in life either you repetition also signals toward important status, trying to get freddy to unconsciously focus on his past failures. After this brief mini session ends, Freddy insists on more and data degrees, but this time with the caveat that Freddy can't blink or the round of questioning, we'll start again from the beginning. This extra strain occupies Freddy's conscious mind and with the priming from the first part established, he begins to answer the questions with more openness and candor I've ever had intercourse with someone inside your family? Yes. Have you ever had intercourse with someone inside your family had been killed? Anyone? No. Maybe not me. Have you killed anyone? Know How many times did you have intercourse with your hand? Three times, whereas no. I don't know what you'd like to have intercourse with her. Again, with the patterns set dot increases the intensity and increases the intensity and increases the intensity to such a pitch that freddy is visibly tensing up. Then at the most charged moment, dot breaks the pattern and asks, ready to close his eyes.

Speaker 2:          05:44          The emotion of this moment is real dislike. Hypnosis is real. Just like psychotherapy and psychoanalysis are real. Let's because cognitive activity is real. It can be harnessed and manipulated and projected and seen from new angles. Auditing is at the center of Scientology because it can produce these feelings of epiphany that convinced people that the methods which achieve it must be correct. That's the danger of scientology to mean hypnotherapy is a valid form of treatment for those who want to seek it out, but scientology flatly denies that auditing utilizes any hypnosis at all, so the people like Freddy, who experienced it unknowingly are susceptible to coercive suggestion. Whether it's done maliciously or by someone not properly trained. It can be persuaded to believe that the church is right with a capital r and thus deserves all the time and money they're asked. To give it.

Speaker 4:          06:40          To make it clear all you have to do a show fellow that he's mocking up his own mind, bear for his own difficulties, and that he is not a completely adrift in am swamped by a body, and there he is. You've got to clear.

Speaker 2:          06:59          Hubbard held that auditing like we see in the master was the way to quote unquote clear every single person on earth when that's your claim, there can be no uncertainty in your methods when uncertainty is the one thing that binds all forms of mental health. We don't understand all the ways the mind works, probably we never will, but psychotherapy and psychiatry functioning within a scientific community within a code of ethics that protects from abuse as made advances, that can help those who are struggling to cope with life. It's not perfect, but it's a hell of a lot better than scientology.

Speaker 5:          07:40          No.
