Speaker 1:          00:01          It's everything is ours. We don't have cell coverage is grounded into a double play that set this up. I told him it was a family discussion. I don't think you should sell it all. I'm telling you. I expect you to get so upset about. I am upset about it. One thing I think film can do really well better than any other medium is capture the reality of conversations in a book. No matter how you lay it out, one piece of dialogue always has to follow another. You can't simulate people talking over each other, which is what we all do a lot of the time and you can't really capture the rhythm, speed and tone that a conversation has. Even radio and theater miss some of the nuances that film is perfectly suited to reproduce. Told us he was in the hospital this morning via text. They were saying we want to information of all the filmmakers working right now.

Speaker 1:          01:01          I think Noah bombeck maybe has the best ear for dialogue as it really is an an eras what it takes because there's a general disconnect between what we all sound like and what movie and TV character sound like, especially the most articulate ones. You asked me that question and then my world came apart and she came here and I landed in the tabloids and I got death threats and my job is constantly in jeopardy and you ruined my life again. Just that of course you don't have to aim at realistic speech. Screenwriters like Aaron Sorkin and Quintin Tarantino have done really great work by writing human dialogue as it could be, finding music and language the same way that Shakespeare did centuries ago, but bomb back. On the other hand, it seems to be committed to a different principal. You know, I think I mentioned to you, I left the company.

Speaker 1:          01:51          I was with him in a couple of other people, started our own firm. It was scary in a big change, but things have settled and we're doing really well. Maureen is talking to a friend about getting someone to come up and review the show for in recent years have essentially been ignored. Some of the back on the map is our logo because $35 for a steak. I think a conversation like this speaks volumes in one sense. Just by looking at it, you can see that this is a total failure of communication between father and son. The two men are on parallel tracks. Matt is talking about his new business and Harold is talking about his forthcoming art retrospective, but in another sense what makes this exchange so heartbreaking and true to life, at least for me, is that they really are communicating with each other just not explicitly.

Speaker 1:          02:40          Matt brings up a major life change and expresses some of the hopes and fears he has about it, and his father immediately brings up his own major life event and some of the hopes and fears he has about that. Implicitly, Matt is asking for approval. He's asking for reassurance and he's asking for constellation. Harold, on the other hand, is denying approval because he bear his son being more successful than he is while asking for reassurance of his own hopes and constellation for his own fears and it's like the two men are firing a volley of missiles at each other. Some are hitting, some are missing, and some are crashing into each other in mid air. I think bombeck understands a key dynamic in conversations, especially conversations with family. When we speak to others, we're often speaking to ourselves attempting to frame dialogue so that the person we're talking to will reflect back the things that we want to believe about us. When I was younger, I was so invested in his grievances is anger the world. They were mine too, but now that I live 3000 miles away and have my own kid thriving business, I don't even get angry at him anymore. It's even just funny. I'm sure a lot of people who just went home for Thanksgiving experienced something like this. You feel that you've changed, that you have an updated nuanced idea of yourself and you're going to show that idea in one way or another to your family

Speaker 2:          04:00          how much money I make you make me feel like a piece of shit because you don't care about it, but to also actually do really obsessed with it. You know that I beat you. The thing

Speaker 1:          04:14          we seem to forget is that as we're trying to get our family to affirm our sense of self are doing the same thing to us and the result is often conflict or a conversation that just goes nowhere or maybe not nowhere. Just not where you intended. That says you started your own company. Yeah, a couple of other guys and you just tell you boss like I want to start with. I was one of the partners so I didn't have a boss. I understand. So you got a better offer? No, there were no offers. That's what was so scary. We were creating our own opportunity because you wanted something smaller, bigger. This is my favorite scene in the movie. It's a minute and 32nd long take of two half brothers attempting to connect by making it one take. You get all the elements of conversation that I spoke about before, including the body language, the projected self confidence of matt and the nervous, insecure energy of Danny always nodding his head like his father.

Speaker 1:          05:08          They're doing this thing where they agree. Well also disagreeing. It's a specific kind of non argument that tells you a lot about their personalities and their relationship. Many of the firms clients came with us, which was surprising. No, we expect it. We can't legally ask clients to come with us. They don't have much choice. It's totally their choice. No, I know because you have their money. Okay. There's so much going on here on one level of Danny is trying to connect with matt by literally trying to finish his sentences. He was also trying to challenge him and assert some dominance by acting like he knows what Matt's going to say. Next, talk about speaking to yourself. Danny is effectively trying to hijack matt sentences and make them his own and listen for this. The next time you're in a conversation, people do this all the time.

Speaker 1:          05:50          Well, their monies with the firm that their money is in investments. I bought Ptolemy lives across the street and I lived across the street. Dad told me about your. Karen is like, you can arbitrage. Yeah. That's not what I do at this point, Matt and Danny or getting sick, which actually makes it appropriate that Danny brings up arbitrage and investment term for when the same asset is worth different values in different places and you exploit that price difference for profit. Exploiting differences in value is a pretty good definition of what it's like to be in a dysfunctional family or a dysfunctional conversation for them matter. It's all him. He said that the system is rigged from the inside. That's not entirely true. Oh, mostly so this is an exciting time. Boy. Good. Victoria and I are having some problems. I never met her. Karen and I separated.

Speaker 1:          06:44          I know. I just said I was sorry. Did you? I'm sorry to and there it is. A moment of connection. One Minute and 13 seconds into the conversation in the Meyerowitz family, moments of connection are few and far between, so when they happen, they land with a special poignancy and know this family has perhaps more intense, more insecure than most. I hope there's something that rings so true about this to me when we talk so often, we fly around each other, working at our own shit, thinking about ourselves. We try to make our meaning clear, but we can't quite say what we want, how we want, when we want. That's because communication isn't easy. Sometimes movies make it seem like it is, but Noah Baumbach isn't interested in that kind of dialogue. He uses the medium best suited for depicting conversations to show us the truth about that, that we miss the mark more often than hit it and that it's a beautiful, meaningful thing when we do what.

Speaker 1:          07:53          One of the questions I get asked the most by far is what kind of software do I use to make these videos to edit?
