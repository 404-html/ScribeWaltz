Speaker 1:          00:15          One consequence of Hollywood being dominated by superheroes and franchises is that by the time you're my age, you've seen about 6,000 action, second summer spectacular. Many are not, and it's pretty easy to distinguish between the two because the reaction is physical as adrenaline being released into your system or not, are you gripping your armrest or not? After watching all these set pieces, I think we've sort of been forced to develop an intuitive sophistication about them. There are no shortcuts to thrilling and audience that's absolutely drowning in this stuff. We recognize and champion good work when we see and feel it. I think that's the secret to the success of franchises like mission impossible, fast and furious, and John Wick. These are movies that are committed to weld, choreographed well edited, real action, okay. Not always. Real cruise understands exactly what he's offering. The three or four genuinely creative set pieces with a serviceable plot that doesn't take itself too seriously and a few charismatic actors can be a really fun movie going experience well worth the price of.

Speaker 2:          01:22          Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:25          In fact, this formula I think in many ways defines the strategy of the marvel cinematic universe. Some of those movies are undoubtedly better than this. Some unfortunately worse, but they've tried their best to hew to this baseline and I think it's worked out pretty well for them. Anyone else? Every ingredient matters of course, but the marvel set pieces have been really consistent by enlarge and they're probably the things that I remember most when I think back on these movies now I know there's a certain amount of fatigue these days about superhero films. I feel that way too. More and more, but you know, if I ever think back to my expectations as a kid for what big screen superhero team up fights would be like. I mean, there's definitely exceeds the laws of physics at all. There's a lot going on here that you don't understand that. The sad part about this is that as a kid I read DC comics, not marvel comics, and unfortunately the DC extended universe set pieces leave a lot to be desired.

Speaker 1:          02:25          There are a lot of reasons for this, I think that people have explored before Zack Snyder's preference for stylized coloring versus the more muted cinematography of the mcu. The overuse of super slow motion and ridiculous virtual camera moves like this, but there are a few other things I want to point out that I think make a bigger difference when it comes to superhero set pieces. The first is that physics matters, but we all know that superheroes do a lot of absurd things. Half the shots that iron man takes would he fatal blows, but people have an intuitive sense for weight and velocity impact, which is why in camera action usually get some more visceral response from audiences. The physics are absolutely real. This doesn't mean that all CGI is bad, but if you're going to use CGI, it's a good idea to pay a lot of attention to the cues that people pick up.

Speaker 1:          03:17          And then the first set piece of winter soldier, for example, the Russo brothers do a great job at gauging captain America strength level for the audience with only a few shots. They lace these in with real hand to hand combat to enhance the realism or take spiderman heavily CG character. It's easy to establish his physics because he's swinging on elastic bands and it's a different type of physics than Iron Mans or the hoax. Too often in DC movies, the physics just don't matter, or the camera is doing something that makes everything feel weightless. Taking away the real force of a punch. For example, I don't even understand the physics of how my toes and there's not enough difference between the heroes for the audience to really feel the power levels. Nothing is graceful or tactical. It's all just brute force. Which brings me to my second point is scan st agnes. Use powers creatively, first time for everything. Angela.

Speaker 1:          04:19          It's not always the case, but there's a good number of times in the marvel movies where powers interact off of one another in ways that you can't predict how our full hundred percent capacity. How about that? Or they take something routine like someone bailing from a car and just go the extra step to DC films. Every character is a blunt instrument, only doing the most obvious thing, which in Superman's case is usually. This frustrates me so much because superman has a laundry list of powers. There has to be some way for him to combine them in a creative way to solve a problem or defeat a clever villain. I know a good filmmaker can figure it out. Finally, the one thing that marvel is really good at is the ability to slip character moments into the cracks of big set pieces. Every action scene has its pauses. When everything stops in the characters, get to say a line or two for the simple things like how much this is. Here are the things that marvel character set on those pauses.

Speaker 1:          05:26          Bulk funding meets you guys be more handsome and taking on a squadron, and he didn't invite me, man, who was laden with Alaska one time where you're from Queens, Brooklyn. Now here are the things that DC characters say. I'm going to stop here. You ever estimate through, so we'll see about that. Next time they shine your light in the sky. Don't go into crafting good set pieces, won't solve all the problems plaguing the EU. They can't make for a good movie alone, but I think you'd be surprised how much people forgive when they've had a genuinely bracing experience at the theater. Eventually the people behind the DC, you. We'll figure it out until then. I'm afraid it's just going to be a whole lot of this.
