Speaker 1:          00:21          It's tempting to think of the ocean as a domain of quiet or Jacques Cousteau himself, called it the silent world, but in fact, the sea is full of noise. Sea Mammals, crustaceans, diving birds, and a number of fish communicate with pulses of sound. Dolphins, as we all know from the modern cinematic masterpiece flipper use echolocation Dolphin's sonar. So you flipped her sense of of sound toward an object and receives an echo back he can see in total darkness. Yeah, about 20 million years after Dolphins mastered echolocation. It occurred to human beings that the skill might have some use when a young man named Leonardo dicaprio drowned needlessly in the ocean following an unfortunate incident with the ship. I can't remember the name of sonar or sound navigation and ranging is only one of the ways that human beings have doubled noise levels in the ocean every decade since the mid 20th century. What was once the exclusive domain of clicks, wines and whale songs is now throng with the thunder of ship propellers, ultra loud naval sonar and seismic surveys of oil and gas companies, which blast air guns so loud, they penetrate kilometers into the ocean floor so loud that they are a million times more intense than that.

Speaker 2:          01:42          Sounds good.

Speaker 1:          01:45          The effect of such deafening noise is devastating to the oceans ecosystem, and by extension the world's at large. It is particularly destructive to Wales who use low frequency noises to communicate across large distances, trapped in that disorienting. Could Kaufmanni whales swim dive erratically, radically causing decompression sickness and mass strandings on nearby beaches. In July of this year of the Obama administration authorized Seismic Aragon testing for an unprecedented swath of the Atlantic Ocean. Something that government itself determined would injure more than 138,000 dolphins and whales, including the North Atlantic right whale of which and where there are only a meager 500 left. My charity for the 2014 project for awesome is the largest international advocacy organization focused solely on ocean conservation. They have the resources, the coordination, and a laundry list of victories against the admittedly huge interests that degrade RC everyday. You know, 100 years ago we had no fear that what we did could affect the vastness of the ocean than a few of our bravest went up into space and the pictures they took, their gave us an urgent new perspective helping us to see that the world which made us could buy us the unmet.
