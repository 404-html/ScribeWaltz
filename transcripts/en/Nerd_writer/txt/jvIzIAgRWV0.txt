Speaker 1:          00:01          This is

Speaker 2:          00:01          the motherboard for the Super Nintendo, a 16 bit video game console that came out in 1991 in America, and these are the sound chips that worked in tandem to create all the audio sound effects and music that you heard in Super Nintendo Games.

Speaker 2:          00:22          The first chip, the SMP or the SPC 700 was a processing court, were a video game. Musician could essentially write the program that would tell the other chip, the DSP, what sounds to me, whereas the original nes sound chip had just five channels and could really only do creative variations on the same basic sound. The Super Nintendo had eight dedicated channels and used a sampling system which meant that artists could load in noises or sound effects from instruments of their choosing with room for eight simultaneous instruments and the ability to sample different sounds. The Super Nintendo was a big improvement over its predecessor, but there was still one huge limitation between the two chips. The system could only accommodate for 64 kilobytes of audio ram. To give you a sense of how small that is, an average three minute MP3 song that you might buy on itunes is around six megabytes, which is 100 times the size of the super.

Speaker 2:          01:19          Nintendo is full capacity and that's just for one song. The 64 kilobytes had to hold all the music and the sound effects for an entire game, which is why you often got music that sounded well, not that great. When you think of sampling in popular music, you might think of someone taking a few seconds of an old drum beat and using it in new song. Call it a sample that's even a few seconds long, carries a whole lot of information in order to stay within the allotted 64 k super nintendo music samples had to be kind of walking all the way down to a single cycle of a wave form. In order to make good music with these limitations, you had to be creative.

Speaker 2:          02:11          What you're hearing now is aquatic ambience from 1994. His Donkey Kong country, a classic by one of video games. Best Composers, David wise wise, was able to ring beautiful music from the limitations of the nintendo sound chips. For example, the evolving swimming background patents that you're hearing in the song sweeps like this, just work possible on the Super Nintendo and sampling something. This long and complex would have quickly exceeded the capacity of the system. So why has had to think outside of the box. One of the most important features of the wave station is the ability to string together a number of waves. Waves can be defined as single and motorcycle loops. With more than 400 internal waves available, you can select up to 255 different to play in any order, including trace of pitch duration and cross fade time wise, took inspiration from the cord wave station, a synthesizer that came out in the early nineties and use something called wave sequencing to take a number of tiny samples and play them in quick succession so that they made unique evolving sounds.

Speaker 2:          03:19          Of course the Super Nintendo couldn't arrange and rearrange samples on its own. So in order to achieve this effect wise, painstakingly recorded individual wave forms at different frequencies and place them all in the coding program, one by one. This program, by the way, is called a music tracker where music is essentially boiled down to numbers. Each tiny sound is placed on a vertical timeline and the columns represent your note octave, sample choice volume in some simple effects like panning, feed and echo. It took wise five full weeks to input every sample for aquatic ambience. It's a tedious process, but the results speak for themselves.

Speaker 3:          04:32          The Super Nintendo was restrictive system for composers. There's no doubt, but as with any limitation breeds creativity because the sound system consists of two chips, 64 kilobytes of Ram and a lot of hexadecimal code doesn't mean it can't make beautiful music.

Speaker 2:          05:00          Hey everybody, thank you so much for watching. This episode was brought to you by verve. Verve is a service that pulls together a lot of great content channels like rooster teeth, Mondo, crunchy roll, and funimation all into one place so you can watch some of the best anime there, but they've also added new channels like movie which hosts a rotating roster of 30 indie movies, which is something that I love. Another show that I would personally like to recommend is gary and his demons about a dude who is destined to fight demons but doesn't really want to do it. It's. It's a funny show. Kind of like rick and morty. I feel like that with verve premium you can get ad free access to Gary and his demons and everything else, all the channels, and for a limited time you can use the first link in the description to get a 30 day free trial of verve. Definitely try that out. Thanks guys. I'll see you next time.
