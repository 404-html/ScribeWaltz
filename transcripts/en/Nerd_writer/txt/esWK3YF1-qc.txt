Speaker 1:          00:04          So I just watched Casey, nice guide to instagram. Video is right here if you guys want to check it out. And I, I couldn't agree more. Instagram has become, you know, my favorite social media platform to, for all the reasons you know that he mentioned that it's pure, simple unsullied by the information dump of facebook. He just said dumb, but more than being just unsettled by the volume of facebook. It's also free of the performances of facebook too. I've talked about our social media personalities before in Vlog Twenty, 70. Click it right here. If you want to check that out. For instagram, I personally follow three simple rules, three simple donuts and I, I've told these to my friends so I might as well tell them to you to rule number one, don't take pictures of yourself. Rule number two, don't take pictures of food. What could possibly be interesting?

Speaker 1:          00:56          How about your beef? Boring, young. What could be interesting about your pasta sauce? A doubt, your pepper Jack Cheese fondue, and rule number three, and I think this is, this is the hardest one to follow. Don't take pictures that show you clearly having fun. Now I still use facebook to be sure, but I've moved more toward instagram because facebook sort of became this virtual, keeping up with the Joneses where instead of getting more and more stuff, it was trying to look more and more cool. I think of the instagram camera as my. I, I use it to share what I see so that people, my friends can experience what I'm experiencing. Do I sometimes break those rules above? I mean no. Never, never. Do I ever break those rules? Of course I do, but they're in my head nonetheless. If you have your own instagram rules, leave them in the comments below and don't be afraid of those people who like to say,

Speaker 2:          01:50          I don't like to live by any rules and you can tell me what to do because that person always talks like this and they have to live with that.

Speaker 1:          02:00          He's a nice that you live in New York City, right? Let's collaborate.
