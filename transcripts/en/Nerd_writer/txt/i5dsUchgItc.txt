Speaker 1:          00:00          Dear sam pepper, a few weeks ago, some hacker release nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence and some other celebrities, and that's something we've seen before. People's privacy being criminally violated, women being criminally objectified on the Internet. What was surprising was the reaction in the days following the leak. Over two dozen articles appeared from different news and periodical sites with headlines like you know who's not to blame for Jennifer Lawrence's nude photo leaks. Jennifer Lawrence stopped blaming Jennifer Lawrence and other celebrities for taking nude photos in the first place. Jennifer Lawrence shouldn't laugh off her nude photo. Jennifer Lawrence nude pics and why you shouldn't look. This isn't about iphones. This is about women being shamed, objectified, and treated like property. These are what we refer to as opinion pieces or think pieces and thanks to the upworthy is one of the Internet. You can pretty much get there just from the headlines alone. You've been a citizen of the web for the last five or 10 years, so you know that the ubiquity of these pieces is growing all the time.

Speaker 1:          00:57          After any controversial event in society or pop culture, you can expect your facebook newsfeed to overflow with articles like this. Sometimes it's annoying people expressing offense as if a fence equated to righteousness or sites producing content just for the sake of producing content. Other times, most of the time, like in the case of that nude photo league, these articles taken together, express the politically correct view of the issue at hand. Now, political correctness has a bad rap in general conversation and like the pieces themselves that can serve to block dialogue instead of just started, but political correctness is itself only an expression of our democratic concern for groups who are habitually and unfairly discriminated against. In other words, it's an expression of morality. What we understand to be right and wrong at this moment in time when coupled with the ubiquity of these think pieces, it seems to me that socially enforced morality has reached an entirely new level of persuasive power for the first time.

Speaker 1:          01:56          The majority of people. I asked about the photo and particularly men told me that they didn't seek out or look at the photos in question citing the reasons in those articles, even if you disagreed with what they said, which I didn't. Those articles served as a sort of script for what to say to family and friends and coworkers if you wanted to stay in good ethical standing with the community that they represent. Now, the response to your video, Sam, of pinching girls on the butt is of the same vein only. It didn't happen in online periodicals. It happened right here on Youtube and tumblr before it was taken down. Your video had over double the amount of dislikes than likes about 70,000 and my tumblr feed was spilling over with elegant condemnations of what you did have particular significance where the responses of John and Hank Green, who are never slow to speak out about situations like this, whether they would accept the title or not, the Vlog brothers have stepped forward as moral arbiter is on a host of issues.

Speaker 1:          02:51          Even if all they do is signal boost the opinions of others. In the case of the marginalization of women, see, for example, the Alex Day deal, they are never equivocal and their community, my community is the better for it. Last Monday, youtube removed your video, Sam, and though it clearly violated their policy on nudity and sexual content, there is no doubt that the public outcry is responsible for that. Look, I know this is a somewhat cold analysis of things, but I'm fascinated by the sociological trends at work here, how moral perspectives move and advance through the culture, how and by what avenues they evolve from dissenting to acceptable do unquestionable and what role an internet of commenters has to play and all that. For the record, I share the morality of the Vlog. Brothers and everyone who has re blogged, what they've written about this, the objectification of women is detestable in all its kinds, especially those which are hard to see and insidious yet keenly felt by every woman.

Speaker 1:          03:48          I know this is a harmful gross and fucking tedious way to act. There's still a long way to go, but you and all the other Sam peppers of the world should really read the writing on the dashboard. Collectively. We've left you behind. Hey everybody. Thanks for watching. The gradual evolution of morality really is fascinating to me and it has instruments all across the culture and the sharpest and most vicious has got to be South Park and a great example of an expression of morality from the culture is their takedown of the redskins team name, which appeared in a commercial during the redskins game last week and I'll put a link for it below. South Park's amazing. If you want to talk more about this, I am always in comments for. You can ask me anything on Tumbler. Thanks again for watching. I'll see you next time.
