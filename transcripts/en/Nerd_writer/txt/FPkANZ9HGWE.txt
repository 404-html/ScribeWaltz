Speaker 1:          00:14          Commonly reported symptoms of clinical depression is a warped sense.

Speaker 2:          00:22          Everything can feel like it's moving in super slow motion. In fact, depression warps everything around it like a star warped spacetime that only your sense of duration, but also your sense of yourself and others. Your mental life is thrown out of all proportion. In his film, Melancholia, Lars von Trier uses skewed proportions to communicate a feeling that he's intimately familiar with. You know, when I ride, I can only write about myself and this is more or less a description of my, my own depression. The very first scene after the slow motion montage that speaking of warp time shows both the end of the film and the end of world is the newly married Justine and Michael trying to get from the ceremony to the reception in a stretch limo that is almost comically too large for the country road that they're driving. Eventually they have to abandon the car and walk, and by the time they get to the castle where the reception is, half of the night has already been wasted.

Speaker 2:          01:28          What's interesting is that the viewer doesn't really feel that lightness. We're only at the beginning of the film and this I think gives us a hint of the weird, almost dreamlike temporal quality of the wedding reception to come. One thing that keeps getting stranger and stranger to me as I rewatched the film is the relationship between Justine and Michael. I mean at times it almost seems as if they don't even know each other. Michael seems to be completely unaware of the severity of Justine's depression and there are a few shots where Michael just stares off blankly like a kind of dead puppet. Here. Again, things are skewed. Volunteer doesn't give us a sense of the couple's past, but I'm getting ahead of myself. The first half of the film is made up of the wedding reception, alternating between the party and justine's various exits as she falls deeper and deeper into an oncoming bout of depression inventory or uses the reception itself to set up an expectation of continuous time, but Justin's exits make this problematic.

Speaker 2:          02:28          The two parts of the sequence don't seem to fit together. Justine rides off in a golf cart all the way across the ground. She languishes in a bath, but the party is always there, always still happening when she returns to it in moods that are increasingly detached, even within the party time jumps forward at the whim of volunteers, disorienting editing, the film critic Marta grow. It's drew my attention to the fact that, for example, the newlyweds first dance is actually a montage of justine dancing with a number of people while the song underneath it, La Bomba plays continuously. What all of this adds up to is an unsettling feeling of subjectivity, of feeling that you're in the head of justine and by extension, volunteer who's attempts to get a handle on things to lock everything in place are upset, and then finally dashed. No one in the film seems capable of measuring things correctly, whether it's the number of beans in a jar, 2,000,006 piece, or the correct trajectory of a rope planet.

Speaker 2:          03:29          Everything that's handled, Burns, creases or shatters, and we ought to mention the several artistic references volunteer makes in the film, many of which are in the very first sequence. The most obvious is this shot, which sites John Everett Malays Painting Ofelia after the character in Shakespeare's hamlet, who is perhaps the most famous depressive in all of literature. Then we have an actual shot of Roy goals, hunters in the snow, a painting of hunters coming back to their village empty handed, which calls to mine another science fiction film concerned with the depths of the soul. Andre Tarkovsky is Solaris. The volunteer is a massive fan of Tarkovsky and there are other similarities here to sell. Ours, for example, makes great use of box coral prelude in f minor, repeating it throughout the film and as he's written, Tarkovsky likes to use music as a reframe. The refrain brings us back to our first experience of entering the poetic world, making it immediate, and at the same time renewing it voluntary or uses the same technique in Melancholia with wagner is a prelude to Tristan and his old, a romantic song that speaks to how the filmmaker mixes his meditation on depression with beauty, like a glowing blue planet and desire.

Speaker 2:          04:43          And there are plenty of other references to like those to elaine. Rene's last year at Mary and bought another film with a dream like narrative structure, and of course these early shots jump forward to reference, but not exactly replicate later moments in the film. Melancholia is no doubt a polarizing film. It's beauty is undeniable, but I'm sure many will argue that it lacks coherence or focus and need. I have my own problems with the second part of the film, but this is one of the most striking portrayals to me of a disease that affects so many, but which is still so little understood in my view. Depression is what happens when your identity, that sense of the relationship you have with the world around you becomes untethered and focused. In this process, everything starts to skew. Time slows to a standstill. Your body wants so easy to move. It feels like it weighs a ton for a person. Memories start to become disorganized. The memories of a film, on the other hand are all those works of art that informed and proceeded. Perhaps this is why Vaughan tree or surrounds his characters with so many. By the time we get to the second half of the film, extraordinary situation, the approach of the rogue planet, Melancholia, warps, even the characters dispositions, justine emerging slowly from the depths of her illness reacts to the existential situation with calm.

Speaker 2:          06:16          Claire on the other hand, hurt seeing other half begins to panic. The film in the end takes on the disease of its main character. I, for one, am happy to see a film. So Ernest, about sadness as it stands, science and medicine have come up short in their apprehension of mental illness. So maybe we ought to look to art for insights and solidarity about what it's like living a life out of proportion.
