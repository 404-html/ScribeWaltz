Speaker 1:          00:01          There's something about treasure that capture every imagination, maybe it's our love for adventure or our love for solving puzzles, or maybe it's just the anxiety of knowing that something's out there waiting to be found in the mid 19 seventies in England, they're renowned publisher Tom Maschler approached a little known painter by the name of Kit Williams. If the idea of making a children's picture book maschler when it's something that no one had ever done before, but Williams was resistant to the idea. He didn't want to work on a dozen or more paintings, only to have people flip through them casually. How could he get readers to give his pictures the attention they deserve without telling maschler Williams came up with the idea of a puzzle book containing 16 original paintings that had clues to the location of the 18 karat gold rabbit that he constructed himself and buried somewhere in England.

Speaker 1:          00:57          Now the has been buried for. The book was called masquerade. It was published in 1979 and it was a massive hit. It went completely crazy. We thought we'd have enough till Christmas and we reprinted a further 50,000 a day off to publication and three days later, yet another $50,000, I've really never seen it, but blanket thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people set about solving the puzzle of masquerade. A year went by and to and still nobody had cracked it, but Williams was receiving huge numbers of letters every day, which she was forced to read or at least skim through so he could confirm whether anyone had solved it.

Speaker 2:          01:37          This package, this has been going on for so long. Then

Speaker 1:          01:46          in March 1982, a little over two and a half years after Williams buried the hair, he received a letter from a man named Ken Thomas. The letter didn't have any insight into how the puzzle system worked in masquerade, but there was a crude map that pointed to the exact place where the treasure was hidden. Williams relieved at this point told him that he was right and said, go dig it up. The puzzle of masquerade is completely unique. Williams invented it himself so that theoretically anyone of any age could figure it out. Here's how it works. Every page feature is at intricately designed picture surrounded by an order with a phrase. The trick was to identify every living creature in the frame and trace a line from its left I through its lefthand. It's right, I threw its right hand, it's left, I threw its left foot and it's right, it's right foot.

Speaker 1:          02:39          These lines would point to letters and the border that could be anjem tumbled into a word in this case burden. If you follow this pattern for all 15 pages, you'd end up with a master phrase that goes like this. Catherine's long finger overshadows birth, buried yellow ambulant midday points. The Hour. In light of equinox, look to figure out what this means. You have to take the first letter from each pages word or words and string them together. If you do that, you get close by and that's it. MTL refers to the town of mtl about an hour north of London, and Catherine's long finger refers to the tall cross that commemorates Katherine of Aragon, first wife of King Henry, the eighth, located in Mtl Park at noon on the equinox. The Sun projects a shadow of that cross onto a specific spot in the grass. That's where Williams hit the golden hair.

Speaker 3:          03:37          No, I never found it,

Speaker 1:          03:49          and that's how kit Williams, masquerade golden hair was finally found, except there's a problem. There is no Ken Thomas, you see, six years after the nationwide search was over the Sunday Times in Britain with the help of a local paper and Mtl discovered that Ken Thomas was actually a pseudonym for duke called Thompson, who was the business partner of a man named John Guard, who at the time of masquerade was living with Kit Williams ex-girlfriend, Veronica Robertson. Robertson had been to [inaudible] park with Williams on a couple of occasions and guests that might've had the prize, their garden. Thompson middle detected the whole area dug holes, but he couldn't find it. It was only after they saw were two physics teachers who had actually solve the puzzle, had been digging that they were able to snatch the hair for themselves. By the time everyone found out about this scandal, Thompson had already used the hair to start a video game company called hair soft.

Speaker 1:          04:47          Its flagship title. Hair razor was a puzzle game that promise the real golden hair to the winter game is pretty much incomprehensible in hilarious video on hair racer, comedian stuart ash, and details why it's probably unsolvable. I'll leave a link to it below. Nevertheless, by the time that the expo say on masquerade came out in [inaudible] 88, the company had gone bankrupt and the golden hair was sold by Southerby's at auction for 32,000 pounds. No one knows who bought it though the BBC did track it down for a documentary on Williams in 2009 after which it went back to its owners to live in secrecy. Once again, nice. Think she again, never, ever say that again. Masquerade launched a new genre of armchair treasure hunts like forest fens million dollar chest of antiques, hiding somewhere in the rocky mountains, still unsolved, and our love for hidden treasure is clear in the popularity of books like the Davinci Code or games like pokemon go or in escape rooms which have flourished across the world. It's just fun to solve a puzzle and go searching for treasure. Still a declaration of independence. Don't steal the declaration of independence.

Speaker 1:          06:08          One of the questions that I get asked all the time is what kind of program do I use to put these videos together? I use final cut pro 10 tate at the nerd writer and there was actually a little bit of a hubbub when 10 came out because apple completely redesigned the program from the previous version. Final cut pro seven and editing tool that I had used for over 10 years was gone and it sucked, but eventually I learned how to use final cut pro 10 by watching a bunch of youtube videos. But what I really wish I had with something like today's sponsor skillshare. Skillshare is an online learning community for creators. With more than 18,000 classes in things like graphic design, animation, web development, and final cut pro 10, all the classes are professional and understandable and follow a clear learning curve. A premium membership begins around $10 a month for unlimited access to all courses, but the first 500 people to sign up using the link below in the description, get their first two months for free, and those two months you can easily learn final cut pro or after effects any kind of skill that you might need to start a new hobby or business.

Speaker 1:          07:12          Definitely check it out guys. It's a really great program. Thanks again. I'll see you next time.
