Speaker 1:          00:01          When I was growing up, Nintendo was

Speaker 2:          00:04          the thing, the original nes console, Super Mario Legend of Zelda metroid, Mike Tyson's punch out battle toads.

Speaker 2:          00:14          Then we got into Sega and all things sonic. Then Super Nintendo came out and I played a lot of donkey Kong country, Aladdin and turtles and time Nintendo. Sixty four was a revelation Mario, 64 Mario Kart, the lesser known but still great. Diddy Kong racing and of course the masterpiece of masterpieces, awkward arena of time for many kids. My generation and after video games were just a part of growing up. After school, I'd go to one of my friend's houses and we'd play 64 or second saturn for a few hours, go outside, run around, play some more, go home. We played video games because it was something to do like playing horse in the driveway or Walpole. It was just another form of competition. The pure competition of games, which is just a way of filling free time with purpose. The last console I ever owned was playstation two and I fell off gaming when gaming got much more complicated than the side scrolling that I grew up with.

Speaker 2:          01:09          If at that time you would've asked me, can video games be art? I would have said I'm 13. What do I know? My opinion on it now is that those games were games. The objectives were clear, the rules relatively simple like soccer or basketball or any other sport. The primary purpose of the experience was to win in the period. Since Games have become vastly more complicated and the question of whether or not that form is an art of fine art has become the topic of serious philosophical debate legally. Of course, that decision was decided on much more specific terms. It started in the early eighties when a series of American court decisions found that video games could not be covered under arts free speech protections because they were no more expressive than pinball or chest. Those precedents determine much of what followed in 2002 federal judge Steven Limbo ruled against the protection of games.

Speaker 2:          02:02          Saying that like, Bingo, the court fails to see how video games express ideas, impressions, feelings, or information unrelated to the game itself. Not until 2011 the matter get the definitive decision that it deserved when the Supreme Court finally extended arts protections to video games in Brown vs the entertainment Merchants Association in a seven to two rule, and of course the legal definition of video game stands quite apart from their philosophical definition, but in the time span of all those little decisions, the scope of video games has expanded to include things like missed grand theft auto, the Sims, rpgs with narratives more compelling than most science fiction in Hollywood or contemporary literature. Games today have real and fully realized economies like the one which was shaken to its core in eve online when this mega space battle from earlier this year destroyed endgame spaceships to the of 300,000 real dollars and visually.

Speaker 2:          03:03          I don't know if you can get more digitally sophisticated than the cinematics for games like Batman Arkham asylum or elder scrolls. I don't know if you can find an experience more elegant than the Gameplay for Super Mario Galaxy or feds. Do. All of these things complex as they are at up to art. Well, at the core of this is the question of whether something that must be categorized as a game can also be categorized as a work of art to be sure all kinds of artistic expression involve some interaction with the source material, but is the physical interaction in gaming of some kind of qualitatively disqualifying kind? I've always been a stickler for distinctions for philosophical labels, but it's questions like this that make me think about why people are very precious about art and they try to include all the things they love under its masthead like advertising or cooking, but to me the desperate attempt to have games included in the art speaks less to the significance of the category of art.

Speaker 2:          04:03          Then the curious lack of significance. We attach in comparison to the category of games. The extraordinary injection of subtlety and beauty into the universe of video games seems to me a herald of what gaming can and will be to us in the future. In the 2012 game called journey, you play as a rope to figure in the desert, moving slowly, gracefully wordlessly toward a shining mountains in the distance. The goal is singular, but gradually informed by traces on the faded civilization. Then you discover along the way the game play the music, the symbolism of the culture that was lost puts you in an emotional space, unique to all other forms of media. Reaching the mountain is like an apotheosis and like the apotheosis of art. It is the kind that life itself is it capable of sustaining. Contained in this game is a meditation both on the unspoiled image of what we want and it's profound unsatisfactories reflection, what we thought. Fuck yeah. For Video Games, thanks for watching and allowing a sort of non game or to take part in this really fascinating discussion. I still do play Mario Cart on a regular basis, so that should give me something. If you liked this video, please share it on reddit. That's just been the best way to get these videos out there and follow me on twitter and Tumbler and asked me anything you want in the comments and I will reply to you. I'll see you next Friday.
