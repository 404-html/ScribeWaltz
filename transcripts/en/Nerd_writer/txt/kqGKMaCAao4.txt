Speaker 1:          00:00          Mm.

Speaker 2:          00:03          Music videos are a weird art form. They're often just a promotional add on to a medium that works just fine on its own. In fact, I think most of the time music works better without visuals. Videos seem to limit song somehow. For me at least, they closed down the possible ways I can experience the music most of the time.

Speaker 3:          00:23          Thirty minutes later, the feds watching it on my gosh. Yes. I mean you ain't getting attempts. I'd be yelling stat in now. Dual gram I do for content.

Speaker 2:          00:34          Lamar is new. Video for his song element is a powerful example of a music video actually expanding my experience of a song rather than collapsing it and it's got me thinking again about what exactly makes for compelling work in this, in between medium watching this, I think the answer has something to do with collaboration. Kendrick is known for a lot of things. He occupies a really rarefied place in popular culture, celebrated for quality and integrity pretty much across the board with a couple of notable exceptions. This is why I say that hip hop is that more damaged to young African Americans than racism in recent years, but we'll get back to that in a little while. One of the things that's less talked about is Kendrick's ability to work seamlessly with other artists. Of course, collaboration is sort of a prerequisite for hip hop. Could rap music depends on the fusion of lyrics and production.

Speaker 2:          01:24          Kendrick's role as a marquee artists and hip hop is a lot like that of a film director who acts in his own work. He can control the lyrical content and its delivery himself, but it's also up to him to choose other artists according to their strengths and help them realize their own creativity in the service of his vision. Working with him throughout the process for me was like very. It was like being needed, like a, like a piece of dough, you know? It felt like somebody was like bending and stretching into like, you know. Yeah. Pulling different things out. It's this kind of skill for directorial collaboration that makes Kendrick's music videos so strong. To understand the element video, you have to understand first the collaborators in this case, there are two, one living and one dead. The first is Jonas Lindstrom, a commercial fashion photographer from Berlin lindstrom directed the video alongside the little homies, which is a pseudonym for Kendrick and Dave free.

Speaker 2:          02:16          The president of top Dawg entertainment element is highly reminiscent of Lindstrom previous work, namely his short film, truth or dare, which features 21 performances or vignettes and elevated version of the content found on mobile phones. Interested in the boundary between photography and film. Lindstrom is great at creating these slow moving tableaus that serve as a reference point for a larger environment in element. Kendrick has them apply that to his own, namely to the violence that's been an inescapable fact of that environment for his whole life. Violence has always been a preoccupation of Kendrick's work. He's examined it from every angle. Looking at the violence that he's endured sometimes at the hands of those closest to him.

Speaker 3:          02:56          At this data in front of my Mama, my comes every medic

Speaker 2:          03:00          to come us bit jummah grandma's bed, so when a buddy brand for me, I'm on your head. The violence he's caused, the violence used to oppress his race and the violence is friends and family visit on themselves. Each of these facets of violence is distilled into a photographic moments. Some of them connect, but they're scrambled drawing you into this churning cycle of violence that is the result of all these distinct images. Kendrick can't be sure that he himself hasn't contributed to this cycle. He's deeply conflicted about his violent past and about his position as wraps, quote unquote savior. Following the rapturous reception of his last album to pimp a butterfly. In many ways dam is a rebuke to that perceived divine status and element is a prime example of that rebuke. Showing that he's not above hip hop's competitive shit talking. They just that they wouldn't go see me, Huh?

Speaker 2:          03:54          Nigga stop decade. That real life at the same light. The CLTV Huh? They just want to flex Somia P and l a for free. Huh? Next time that you get the 10 freeway, we need receipt on. The one thing Kendrick Lamar is sure about is that the music itself is not the problem. This is why I say that hip hop has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years. Kendrick plays the sample elsewhere on the album. Clearly it's something he's wrestled with, but for Kendrick music is a way to cope with an understand his world, not the cause of its ills, and this is where his second collaborator comes in. Three of the shots in elephant are direct references to the work of Gordon Parks. One of America's all time great photo journalists and filmmakers. Parks was the first prominent commercial photographer to capture the black experience for a nationwide audience is focused on the inner cities for life magazine was hugely important during that period, and the power of his photography is that it forces people to see what would otherwise remain invisible to them. Parks was heralded for his ability to get close to his subjects, to earn their trust so that he could eliminate the intimate truths of their lives. I'll give a fuck. I don't give a fuck. I don't give up. Don't give up. Don't give a fuck

Speaker 2:          05:10          by citing parks. Kendrick aligns their artistic goals he liked parks, commits to depicting the realities of his community with clear eyes, even if that means depicting himself as the product of a violent culture or a violent country or sometimes as someone who perpetuates those things. I'm not a big fan of music videos, but the way Kendrick brings the visions of Lindstrom and parks into sync with his own, his masterful the result of the collaboration is a music video that operates a lot more like a poem that connects the song and the album's content with more touchstones, not less element is a video that lets you look into Kendrick's world and in the end for a brief terrifying moment, forces you to see through its eyes. Got It, got the, made it look sexy. My element by element.
