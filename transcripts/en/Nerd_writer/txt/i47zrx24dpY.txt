Speaker 1:          00:05          Come on, you mentioned to me this is the sacred lake. This is my spot for me to read. Can't tell you the number of books have right here. Hm. Oh my God. It's freezing. Absolutely. With a couple of children. I think it would pull it out and everything. I know myself and we've been good. We haven't done anything to be ashamed of and it's a good thing. I want to be good. Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:47          It would be pretty cool to design a film studies course around, call me by your name. The movie opens up its own interesting lane in film history, populated by auteurs trying to disappear from their work, which is a paradox worth exploring. The movies that this class would feature. A handful of which you just saw in the opening sequence, have similarities that are focused by call me by your name and by director Luca Quad Nino's vision. It's not that quite an Nino quotes or pays homage to his influences. He does something that's much harder. He actually learns the lessons that these influences teach and applies them in a way that adds to his personal style.

Speaker 2:          02:29          The most obvious influence I think are the films of James Ivory specifically to have his elm forester adaptations, a room with a view, and Morris I say obvious because ivory was in his late eighties. No less the screenwriter for call me by your name. The market has a long career at the merchant ivory production company is all over this movie now you might not know merchant tie for you. The director, producer, team of ivory and his life partner is mile merchant, but along with their screenwriter, ruth, Joe Vala, they created 44 films together, fun, highbrow, literary adaptations, period pieces with lavish costumes and sets, and this may sound like stuffy pump is filmmaking, but the merchant ivory films or anything but they leave with life room with a view. For example, nature is a symbol of freedom against the social restrictions of the Gordian England ivory, like Wat a Nino captures the warm tactile qualities of being outdoors and uses the sense memory that these images and sounds evoke as a way to trigger empathy for the characters

Speaker 3:          03:41          in both films. The desire for summer afternoons is paralleled with the desire for love or sex

Speaker 2:          03:49          in Morris and adaptation of foresters, novel of homosexual love. The similarities are more apparent, the important ways that both Morris and Leo tentatively realized and act upon their feelings are physical, not verbal, and this is what a good filmmaker and good actors bring to an adaptation. The translation dialogue into gesture. Sure. A second key influence are the films of Eric Rohmer, the last of the French new wave directors who style was less iconoclastic than Godard or truffaut, yet whose career sustained in quality much longer than many of his contemporaries. Romero is known as a very wordy filmmaker. His movies feature characters having extended philosophical conversations on love and desire. Yet what Gwadar Nino draws from him is his simplicity, his unsentimental presentation of characters in space and his camera work like the genre Anwar, who came before him. Romana is interested in realism, but not at the expense of beauty like roamers and renoirs squat.

Speaker 2:          04:56          A Nino's camera in call me by your name isn't showy and his editing isn't manipulative. Quad Nino and a cinematographer only used one lens, a 35 millimeter to mimic roughly the feel of human eyesight and the camera follows the action, but in the way and observer might in all of these filmmakers, long takes, don't feel stylized or distracting. They function as a window into the environment and it's important that we see that environment. This space is these characters inhabit, so depth of field is usually deep and the use of closeups is rare. As Ramiro once said, the reason I don't like a close up is because it excludes, it doesn't add, it takes away. It suppresses the relationship of the character to the set, and what's important for Guantanamo, Nino is that he gives the actors enough room and time for the space between them to become charged with emotion.

Speaker 2:          05:49          Finally, maybe the most important influence on the structure of call me by your name is the French director. Maurice Plr, especially his film I s'mores law is another figure on the outer rim of the French new wave who barely has any recognition in America. His films are rough and unsentimental to the extreme, even sloppy at times, but the brim with a wild energy, they're driven by people who are slaves to impulse and what Quad Nino admires about plr is how these impulses drive the construction of the narrative. It's almost dizzying how a no s'mores, for example, a coming of age film about a sexually charged adolescent trips from scene to scene without consideration for a traditional story arc that cut between two shots could represent a jump of two seconds or two months and the audience isn't prepare for either when to call me by your name isn't as extreme as this, but gotten dino's narrative follows a similar rhythm where the through line isn't the developments of a three act plot, but rather the energy of Elios desire and how that manifests.

Speaker 2:          06:54          These unusual structures are so important because narrative art is one of the ways in which we model our own lives and there can be falseness in what is sometimes called Hollywood films that influences our expectations of experience. For instance, the whole time I was watching call me by your name. I was anxious for the person or the institution that would inevitably challenge Elio and Oliver is affair. It's something I'd come to expect in films and stories of this kind, but when that didn't happen and I released that pent up energy, it was a revolutionary feeling like the film was opening up a new corner of life differently to see things, see without my eyes first time that you don't have to understand these films or these directors to enjoy. Call me by your name. In fact, this lineage is built around the notion that you can have a radical effect on viewers without a radical style. I think why Denino's sin, Ophelia? His love of films is the very best kind. It doesn't exclude people for not being in the know. It brings influences together in the service of a brand new style to appreciate it.
