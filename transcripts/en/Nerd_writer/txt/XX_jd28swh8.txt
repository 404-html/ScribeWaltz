Speaker 1:          00:00          Another day, another 10th flog coffee on a Tuesday and blog for.

Speaker 1:          00:16          For me, it's about stories I'm drawn to art forms that availed themselves of stories and the development of character because I love hearing about how people choose to get along in their century or less of life within stories. There are genres and sub genres that I find particularly interesting because of their capacities to eliminate certain parts of our experience that we may be hiding from ourselves. For example, maybe we tell ourselves that we're free in control, that there's a plan or a person guiding us, that reality is hard, like a stone and knowable. It's an important function of fiction to tear these things down. In this vein, one of my favorite genres is cyberpunk, a projection of postmodernism, which is itself a refutation of general theories and drawing heavily on science fiction. Cyberpunk is a reaction to the information age, the age of the personal computer established in the work of William Gibson's neuromancer series. Cyberpunk features the interaction of high tech and low light as Lawrence Pearson describes it.

Speaker 1:          01:13          Classic cyberpunk characters were marginalized, alienated loners who lived on the edge of society in generally dystopic futures were daily life was impacted by rapid technological change and ubiquitous datasphere computerized information and invasive modification of the human body. What makes cyber punk still compelling, I think is that a lot of these things are already prevalent. The Internet, social media, artificial organs, augmented reality, and most recently the Google glass now that our future will become dystopic. Well, that's a stretch, but this is fiction and I don't think it's really the point of science fiction to be predicted. There's a deeper level in cyber punk and I think that it's captured best in the film blade runner. I think cinema is uniquely suited to cyber punk because it has the advantages of the visual and auditory, the neon moving lights, the little ting longing music of the brilliant Vangelis. I mean as soon as that first note goes bad and the brilliant score to blade runner before the credits or even over, you know exactly what the movie is going to convey here. Just take alice

Speaker 1:          02:35          gives me chills every time. Blade runner's meticulous, romanticization of cyber punk, I think is key to understanding its power. I think that the breakdown in the social order, the overload of information, the sheer size and incomprehensibility of this kind of dystopia appeals to an important part in every one of us. It's the desire to surrender, to succumb to the quite apparent truth, that everything means nothing. It's my idea, and I admit that it's a controversial one, that everyone furtively understands that life is meaningless despite what they profess to believe in public, and that a moderated submission to this chaos is in fact profoundly healthy. Key word moderate cyberpunk allows us away into this part of ourselves. It reflects loneliness, the evasion of responsibility, and the severe impotence of man in the mouth of the universe. It makes chumps that of scientists and dogmatists alike, and though it tears down the walls I've built to protect myself from the largeness of nihilism, it's at the same time a feeling of loveliness as if I was listening to a gentle song

Speaker 2:          03:43          and when the note turned

Speaker 3:          03:47          had melted.
