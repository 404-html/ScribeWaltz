Speaker 1:          00:14          The first piece of art that I was intensely interested in, the first thing that affected me so powerful that I was driven to understand why sweeping epic about the Lord of dreams that started me on a path that's led to here dream or Morphea says he's most commonly called in the series, has done the same for a lot of people. Indeed, when game and made his lead character, the personification and master of dreams, he played on both meanings of the word, the visions we have one asleep and the wishes that consume us when awake. There is so much to explore and Sandman and I may do more on this, but today I want to zero in on the unique place that William Shakespeare has in the series and how his presence helps game and communicate some themes about writing dreams and genius. Shakespeare makes three appearances in San man's 75 issues the first time we see them as toward the beginning of the series in the context of another person's story dream and his sister death make an agreement in a 14th century tavern when they overhear a man saying that.

Speaker 1:          01:20          The only reason people die is because everyone does it. Death agrees not to take this man hub gasoline until he desires it and dream agrees to meet him in the same bar once every hundred years to discuss how he's feeling on their second meeting in 15, 89 dream and hop over here, a man name will shack spurred pining to his friend and fellow playwright, Kit Marlowe about his great wish to give men dreams that would live on after I'm dead. So dream strikes, another bargain with him, the details of which we learn on their second meeting. This time on the south downs of Sussex, England, where Shakespeare traveling with a troupe of players is preparing his new play of midsummer night's dream display we learned was written for dream one of two plays about dreams in exchange for Shakespeare becoming the figure we know today the vessel for the great stories of mankind, Shakespeare's troop are enticed to perform for the real inhabitants of fairy were visiting the earthly realm at dreams invitation.

Speaker 1:          02:23          Perhaps for the last time in the process of this story which takes place toward the middle of the series. Dream begins to question if he was right for giving shakespeare what he wanted. He did not understand the cost. He says, mortals never do. They only see the prize, their heart's desire, their dream, but the price of getting what you want is getting what you once wanted. Here we begin to see the purpose behind Shakespeare's inclusion in this series through Shakespeare and analog for dream and Gaiman himself. We get a meditation not only on genius, but on the cost of genius. The for gaming. That cost is isolation, isolation of all forms. In this issue, we meet him, Shakespeare son, Shakespeare seems to regard him as a nuisance and Hamnett laments to another actor. He's very distant. He doesn't seem like he's really there anymore. Not really. It's like he's somewhere else.

Speaker 1:          03:23          Anything that happens, he just make stories out of it. I'm less real than any of the characters in his place. In his eagerness to write great stories. Shakespeare becomes isolated from his family and his life, such as the cost of extreme focus, but works of genius also become isolated from their context. At the intermission of the play, dream breaks the news to Shakespeare that his friend Christopher Marlowe has been killed. The timing is no accident here. The rise of Shakespeare beginning with plays like a midsummer night's dream signaled the disappearance of his contemporaries like Christopher Marlowe from the historical record in modern cultural memory. Barring academia, their presence has been overshadowed by isolated genius game and picks up this theme again in the final appearance of Shakespeare in Sandman, which is also not accidentally the final issue of the series. Here Shakespeare is writing his final play, the tempest, the second play at the end of his career that fulfills his bargain with dream.

Speaker 1:          04:29          His friend and sometimes critic Ben Johnson comes to visit him and asks about the new play. Have you been rating poor Holland shed again, or does plutarch's bear the brunt of your depredations? This of course references the fact that Shakespeare famously took many of his plots from prior sources and histories like those of Rafael Holland shed and plutarch. Yet these sources like small planets like Christopher Marlowe and Ben Johnson, do not register against the massive star. That is Shakespeare. An example, back in the first issue in 1789 at their fourth meeting, Hob gambling tells dream he has seen a production of King Lear mentioning the idiots have given it a happy ending that will not last dream says the great stories will always return to their original forms. Here Gaiman is playing with us. He knows what the average man epitomized by hop gatling does, not that it was shakespeare who changed the ending.

Speaker 1:          05:29          The original versions on which lear was base did have a happy ending, but those versions are for God, and yet by having dreams say the great stories will always return to their original forms. Gaming indicates perhaps the key theme of the whole series, the power of dreams to supplant reality. In the second issue, Oberon King of fairy watches Shakespeare's play about himself and says to dream what but things never happened. Thus, dream responds apropos of this theme, things need not have happened to be true. Tales and dreams are the shadow truths that will endure when mere facts are dust and ashes and forgot. The very next panel features the line from a midsummer night's dream that criticizes the power of stories, the best in this kind or but shadows gaming like Shakespeare disagrees, the shadows, these illusions of reality incomplete as they are may come in time to replace the real thing.

Speaker 1:          06:34          Indeed, Shakespeare was the vessel for extremely powerful stories. His treatments of culture, of love and madness in many ways created the age we still live in. We are all in a very real sense living in the dreams of Shakespeare. Sandman is a singular work of art coming and propelling comics into a higher literary appreciation and pulling like Shakespeare's work on a vast catalog of mythological, religious and literary references. It's fitting that gaming is more interested in Shakespeare, the man that his work Shakespeare dream and game and like I said, are all analogs for one another and each in their turn have to examine the costs of telling great stories. The largest part of that cost, it seems is isolation. I watched my life as if it were happening to someone else. Shakespeare tell street my son died and I was hurt, but I watched my hurt and even relished it a little for now, I could write a real death, a true loss in three issues that span the series.

Speaker 1:          07:45          Neil gaiman treats these themes of genius and isolation within a larger framework of a story that is essentially about stories. The inclusion of Shakespeare highlights the uneasy relationship between stories, collective dreams, and those who create them. History and imagination, amend Shakespeare to fit their purposes just as Gaiman does, by bringing him to life in the pages of Sandman and game and imagines him isolated from his own life as history has isolated him above his time and place even as we make our work, our work makes us and it can obliterate us to. In other words, dreams really do

Speaker 2:          08:32          come true.

Speaker 3:          08:40          Hey everybody, thanks for watching and welcome to everybody who is new to the nerd writer that inside out video. I can't believe so many people watched that. That was just an awesome experience last week, but this is a great example of the kind of stuff we do here. The nerd writer, we take art and culture and science and politics and explore them and go in depth and put ideas to work and that's what this is all about. And the channel is made possible by your pledges on my Patrion page right here, this little as a dollar per video, you know, the money that you guys give me goes directly into these videos, um, and to, toward improving the channel. And that is really what I want to do is push this medium farther, you know, create new styles, new ways of exploring and explaining ideas. And there's a lot more than I want to do. This was awesome. I've been thinking about how to analyze comics for a long time. Hope you enjoyed it. And anyway, thank you again and welcome to the nerd writer. We have a lot of fun here. Um, I will see you guys next Wednesday.
