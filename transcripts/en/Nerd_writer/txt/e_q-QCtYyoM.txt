Speaker 1:          00:07          Coffee on a Tuesday and block 16.

Speaker 2:          00:20          I should start by saying I'm more of an atheist than it is. In other words, my view is not just that there is no reason to believe that there is a deity and that all the arguments that there is one have long since been exploded by philosophers, astronomers, scientists, physicists, biologists and so forth. Um, mainly by philosophers, the, my opinion, um, but that it's a good thing that that's not okay.

Speaker 1:          00:45          How do we describe Christopher Hitchens as a writer, journalist, teacher, political commentator, contrarion atheists, extremely adept debater as a champion of truth, democracy, whiskey, and a piece of advice his mother gave him when he was just a young boy, that the only unforgivable sin is to be born. Yvonne's advice was never forgot. It became one of the most successful at penetrating thinkers of his time. Publishing several books, tearing down sacred cows from Mother Teresa. Fanatical Albanian

Speaker 2:          01:08          dwarf lying. Thieving of Bill Clinton. No, I think he is even by, even by the most relaxed standard, an unusually hollow and empty and cold individually and completely ruthless. Henry Kissinger, criminal is Henry [inaudible]. Job description on has been since you first caught Richard Nixon's. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:26          I had. The one and only got the Christian answer is, of course you have freewill. The boss insists upon it. You lionized Jefferson, Orwell, Thomas Paine. He wrote columns for Vanity Fair, slate magazine, the Atlantic. He was a prolific and viber and inhaler two things which no doubt shortened his life in the end, but he was too smart not to know that you get out of alcohol, what you put into it, and as he was a scotch man like me and a Johnny Walker man like me, I can only say simply everything in moderation.

Speaker 1:          01:59          Take two. And as he was a scotch man like me and a Johnny Walker man like me, I can only say three. Take for everything in moderation. Takes Breakfast of champions. League is work for yourself. Agree with him or done. My Point is not to vindicate his. To me. Christopher hitchens represents something. The world is always in short supply of men and women of letters, intellectual, one apologetic for being so sometime in the last couple of centuries, intellectuals lost their credit and the western world and just when they were doing so good in the enlightenment in our time, the word intellectual has come to be synonymous with pretend anti intellectualism isn't old and repetitive story. It made itself a home in Mussolini's, Italy, Stalin's Russia, Hitler's Germany, where you can trace it back in time through religion all the way to the death of socrates or you can move forward in time to the populist. Politicians like George W,

Speaker 3:          02:42          but I like to mountain bike. I liked country music on my ipod

Speaker 1:          02:47          strategy. We're intellectuals are pitted against the uncorrupt salt of the earth. Good to have a beer with folk like this. Anti intellectual wisdom is troubling in all its manifestations, but maybe nowhere more so than in youth court.

Speaker 3:          02:59          They

Speaker 4:          03:00          are impressionable and they have the cash. They are corporate America's $150 million dollar dream.

Speaker 1:          03:08          The idea here is that the advertising industry has transformed the language thought and actions of teenagers into commodities. In order to sell them popularity, creating a generation who was completely uninterested in maturing to adult, but take this how you want. There is certainly a good point here, but what I saw in myself and others as a young teenager was that being an idiot is ease. It's amazing when you're an idiot. Everything that comes out of your mouth is idiotic with no work at all, but when you want to be intelligent, everything you say requires a little work, a little bit of thought and effort to compose yourself, so it's not to be inane or contradictory or redundant, doesn't mean that intellectuals can't be silly. It doesn't mean that we can't turn our brains off every once in a while. We all need them.

Speaker 1:          03:46          Well being an intellectual, no matter how you slice it is hard. It takes introspection and time and a willingness to be critical of yourself and it never stops being hard. It gets harder. The reward is that hard work becomes the reward. Learning becomes a commodity as bright and infinitely renewable as the sun. Everyone can and should be an intellectual, whether you're a doctor or a plumber or a president or a germ. All it takes is putting yourself on the record. It takes writing something and submitting it to the public for if you're a painter, lawyer, filmmaker, dancer, that's great, but still right, musician, engineer, diplomat, accountant. Fantastic. What still words or the units of thought and if you listen to anything I say, let it be this. We learn by saying, not think ideas are like clouds. You can't hold onto when we compose a sentence, we make the idea of solid. Then we can put it in our pockets and take it with us.

Speaker 2:          04:34          What do you think it takes to lead a good life? For me, I'm irony. I'm literature as the source of reflection on moral and ethical and human topics. I'm laughing at the misfortunes of others that gets me through it all. Um, I love, uh, and some of the things that go with, um, the possibility of passing on your genes to children, the, any kind of immortality or whatever. And did I mention this already? Laughing at the misfortune of others. And it will be improved, right? I'm being vindicated in arguments that other people wish they hadn't had with you. They have to say, okay, I was Roman. You are right.
