Speaker 1:          00:02          This might be a silly question, but what do you do with a beached whale? That's a question. The small Canadian town of Trout River is trying to figure out right now, an 81 foot beast of a whale washed up on one of his rocky beaches last week as food and it's humongous. Stomach begins to rot and decompose. Bacteria proliferates and that bacteria in turn begins to feed on the whales. Inerts microbes called anaerobic mythology and start to break down molecules and release methane gas into the sealed environment, billowing that fucker up like a birthday party balloon wait too long and the whale might explode. It's a cool concept, but you don't really want that if you're trout river bringing and unassuming gentleman to sort of poke it with a stick and you're going to get the same results. So what do you do? Well, you really have two options.

Speaker 1:          00:55          You can either airlift the dead whale back into the ocean so that its carcass can feed an entire ecosystem of life for decades. Side note, Radiolab has an awesome animation of how this process works and you can find that link in the description or you can bury the whale somewhere on land. Both options are going to be really expensive and that's public money, Aka tax money, Aka your mind, but if you do nothing, the methane gas along with the ammonia and hydrogen sulfide are gonna. Get really smelly really fast. Side note, ammonia is the one that smells like cat piss and hydrogen sulfide is the one that smells like rotten eggs and is the part one. You're gonna have to do something. Trout River and and before you say anything, because I can see the look in your eyes, don't think about blowing it up. I mean we tried that already in in Portland, Oregon in 1970

Speaker 2:          01:50          that had to be fed. The Oregon State Highway Division. Not all had a whale of a problem on a tab.

Speaker 1:          02:06          Those thudding noises that you hear, that's thousands of pieces of whale carcass showering. Unsuspecting passers by and what I'm sure still remains the most traumatic experience of their lives.

Speaker 2:          02:19          Art Car over a quarter of a mile from the black fight was the target of one large chunk. The passenger compartment literally smack. Fortunately no human was hit as badly as the car over. Everyone on the scene was covered with small particles of dead.

Speaker 1:          02:33          It just goes to show you can't blow up all your problems. Sometimes you have to hunker down and invent the portal gun.

Speaker 1:          02:43          Are we, are we working on this? Fucking him. You may have noticed that sometimes I'll disappear for a few weeks or months without any message of where I've gone and I'm sorry about that, but I don't know if you're like this, but I can't seem to stop jumping to different projects. Like I did this sketch comedy channel called Dick Soap, which you can check out or the electronic app, a new disguises which you listened to on spotify, but I'm back for the nerd writer for a little bit. Hopefully I'm going to try to separate it into like season, so six or 10 episodes. Um, and hopefully this is the beginning of a stretch. So thanks for sticking with me. Uh, and I will see you next time.
