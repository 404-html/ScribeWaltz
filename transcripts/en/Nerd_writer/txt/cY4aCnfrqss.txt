Speaker 1:          00:05          Since around 2008 when the DSLR revolution full frame sensors in the hands of amateur filmmakers and videographers, super shallow depth of field has become something of a cliche in indie filmmaking. For a lot of filmmakers, myself included. This effect was used not just as a tool but as a crutch to achieve that cinematic look. These days, super shallow focus is everywhere. It's a fashion more than a technique, so it's really, really cool to see an episodic show like the handmaid's tale, incorporate the effect in a systematic way as a motif of its visual language and the director of the first three episodes of the show, the director who set the tone is Reed Morano, a former cinematographer. She in her own DP for this project, Colin Watkinson created an extremely concentrated aesthetic one that is beautiful and terrifying at the same time. To capture the dystopian world of Gilliad meant choosing the right camera and the right lenses.

Speaker 1:          01:03          Marano shot on the Arri Alexa Minis in four K and use lenses that open all the way up to apertures of one point three and one point four, which means your depth of field is going to be razor thin and everything outside of that field is going to be blown out in a pretty uniform blur. This shallow focus serves the story in three ways. First, to capture the main character's point of view offered played by Elizabeth Moss is a handmade in the republic of Gilead, a theocratic and totalitarian state that has overtaken America in which women no longer have any rights. Handmaids are the last woman who can still have children. The rest of society being largely sterile and they're forced to bear children for leaders of the regime, but it wasn't always like this before the revolution off. Fred lived in the America of our time, and the story of the handmaid's tale is really the story of the transition between America and Gilliad told through the experience of offered to die.

Speaker 1:          02:00          Listen to that horror read in Watkinson, focus on the face. It's hard to remember a show that relied so much on one extreme closeup, but Elizabeth Moss is definitely up to the task with a camera mere inches from her nose. The filmmakers combined a wide 28 millimeter Zeiss Lens, used only for these shots with a shallow depth of field to create intense intimacy with her bonnet on. It's almost as if we're under a blanket with a character. The shallow depth of field extreme closeups are an effective way to get the audience to identify with, offer it, but they also point to an important theme that as a slave in an authoritarian state, where your physical being is effectively controlled by someone else, you're only agency is mental. The mind is where you have to retreat to escape, to plan, and to remember. It's only a thin plane of focus, but it's still yours.

Speaker 1:          02:53          Second, shallow focus is used to help create the world of Gilead. Unlike many dystopias you see in film and TV, Giliad is not a post apocalyptic world of rubble and ruin. It's actually the opposite and meticulously manicured New England full of sunlight and green foliage reading Watkinson site. Kubrick as an inspiration and they echo a lot of his one point perspective framings and definitely capture the creepiness of that, but for the women of Gilliad, what's notable about this world is how little they know about it. Think of all the knowledge that's accessible to you through the Internet and Gilly ad. Women are not only prohibited from going online, they're prohibited from reading. Anything. Result is a perspective that's extraordinarily narrow and shallow. Depth of field captures this perfectly because it literally narrows the visual information in Focus. The handmaid's tale is constructed in fragments. You have America and you have Gilliad, and the show gives you pieces in between the two, but never the full timeline.

Speaker 1:          03:51          This is in part because the show's primary characters don't have the full timeline themselves, this brutal new world, or at least the conditions that made it possible snuck up on them. I have to let you go, but that doesn't mean it came out of nowhere that they aren't somehow connected. For example, even though reading Watkinson adopted more handheld verite style for the flashbacks, the shallow focus remains and they do this. I think to suggest that both worlds suffer from problems of limited perspective in Gilead perspective is limited by force, but in our world perspective is limited by choice. We keep our heads down, eyes glued to our screens, stuck in our echo chambers. While the blurry world around us changes. It brings home a vital message that our rights are not guaranteed by the world. We fight for them and have to protect them everyday because it can be taken away from us if we don't pay attention to the world.

Speaker 1:          04:45          Beyond our focus. Everyone likes shallow depth of field. It's beautiful and because it's beautiful, everyone uses it to make their work look better, more professional, more cinematic, and as a result, we get used to seeing it. When I watch the handmaid's tale, I was amazed at how much the depth of field influence my feelings about the characters and the world and the story. It's just rare that you see this device used with such purpose, so methodically and so effectively, and it really is effective. If you don't believe me, binge watch a few episodes of the handmaid's tale than go outside at guarantee. You'll have a new found respect for how much there is to see.

Speaker 2:          05:34          One of the questions I

Speaker 1:          05:35          get asked the most is what software I use to make these videos to edit. I use final cut pro 10 and since 10 is so different from the version of the program that came before it.
