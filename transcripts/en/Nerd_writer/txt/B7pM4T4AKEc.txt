Speaker 1:          00:00          Biblically, boop and Gobbledy Goop, coffee on a Tuesday and blog, 41.

Speaker 2:          00:16          Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:17          Reading over last week, Sunday Times, I came across this article by Christie Wampole, how to live without irony, airs out certain grievances and irritation she has about hipsters. The archetype she says of ironic living, the hipster haunts every city, street and university town manifesting enough style for times he never lived himself. This contemporary urban harlequin appropriates outmoded fashions, the mustache, tidy shorts, mechanisms, fixed gear, bicycles, portable record players and hobbies, homebrewing playing trombone. He harvests awkwardness and selfconsciousness before he makes any choice. He has proceeded through several stages of self scrutiny and wouldn't it be nice if columnists proceeded through those same several stages of self scrutiny themselves. She continues to exhibit ironic tendencies. For example, I find it difficult to give sincere gifts. Instead, I often give what in the past would have been accepted only at a white elephant gift exchange, a kitschy painting from a thrift store or a coffee mug with flashy images of Texas, the lone star, state plastic Mexican wrestler figures.

Speaker 1:          01:14          The simple act of noticing myself defensive behavior has made me think deeply about how potentially toxic, ironic posturing could be. The simple act of noticing myself defensive behavior has made me think deeply about how potentially maybe I'm guessing that you guys are bad gift givers to. Right. Okay, so the crux of this article is that ironic living exemplified by hipsters is a defense mechanism that allows us to evade the vulnerable intensity of naked personal interaction. She hangs a lot of this on the digital toys we carry around with us and a deep desire for sentimentality and nostalgia and I must say that nostalgia, sentimentality and defense mechanisms are all conditions that I suffer from. They also happen to be numbers 12, 35 and 63 respectively of the human condition for a full list of the human conditions. You can visit yourself and yet even if I suffer from these symptoms, I don't know that you could diagnose me with the supposedly endemic of ironic living.

Speaker 1:          02:08          Really. I don't know anyone. When you get down to it, who you could diagnose with that. After I came back from Paris, the most frequent question I was asked was not really a question at all, more of a statement with a question mark. At the end of the French, people don't like Americans, right? This I found perplexing because for the six months that I lived there, not a single French person treated me poorly for my Americanness and affliction I am no doubt soaked. In fact, the people I met there were so generous. The relationships so easily formed and quickly deep that I was doubly perplexed by the stereotype to these people I answered. Invariably, every man is his own man. Every woman, her own woman kind people like to be treated kindly and French. People who walk around with sad faces like to be asked what's wrong in France and at home, I have friends who have typewriters and fixed gear bicycles who brew their own beer and cover their walls with stuff they found on the side of the street.

Speaker 1:          02:59          Some are politically active. Others not so much. Some are certain who they are and what they want to do. Others not so much. Sometimes they look at their phones when I talked to them, other times they walk around with sad faces. I asked them what's wrong and they tell me. Sometimes they ask me. Finally one Paul writes, what will future generations make of this ramp and sarcasm and unapologetic cultivation of silliness. Will we be satisfied to leave an archive filled with video clips of people doing stupid things? Stupid things, Huh? Exhibit a Charlie McDonald's last video. I'm scared. Exhibit B, Nine hundred and 21,835 views. Exhibit C, 40,000. Seventy two comments. I'm proud to be part of an archive of passionate people saying sincere things and I'm convinced that what we do is contagious and if I may be so bold as to state a common mission, it's to circulate with force the notion that every person is at all times going through something and that it's not right to judge individuals based on groups if it is at any time, right to judge individuals. Period. A simple message, but a strong one and I was sure that understanding it was part of the interview process for professors at Princeton University. Don't get me started. I'm really professors

Speaker 3:          04:22          tell me that the system can be that.
