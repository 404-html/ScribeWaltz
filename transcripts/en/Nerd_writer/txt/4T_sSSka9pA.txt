Speaker 1:          00:04          It's impossible to imagine the long awaited sequel to blade runner without some version of the iconic music that Vangelis composed for the original. That's because the blade runner score is more than a score. It's an indispensable element of the movie. I mean, you could make that argument about almost all film music of movie minus it's music. It's not the same movie and, and that's true too. If you were to swap one kind of music,

Speaker 2:          00:29          nothing

Speaker 1:          00:39          in the video I did on Howard shores, incredible light motifs in the Lord of the rings. I tried to show how the score helped guide and elevate the emotional beats of the story. It's great work from a great composer and hugely influential on the trilogy. I think blade runner's music is different. It plays a different role. The score isn't laid on top of the visuals. It's not a guide or an addition. The music is sort of baked into the DNA of the movie itself. All the audio that you hear including score, sound, design, dialog, it's tightly integrated. Each blurs into the others. Creation is really what separates blade runner from other science fiction films. After all, electronic music had been a staple of science fiction cinema for three decades. By then going all the way back to Bernard Herman's use of the therapy in the day the earth stood still herman, another revolutionary composers like Lewis and Bebe Barron used winding, bending, sputtering, electronic sounds to evoke aliens and alien planets. Renner is somewhere in the middle between the a melodic soundscapes of forbidden planet and the grand symphonic themes of something like star wars and they gave us is pulling from that same toolbox of electronic sounds, but these noises are put to use for a more musical purpose in order to achieve that dream like quality that the film has. The audience shouldn't be able to identify where the music ends and the World

Speaker 1:          02:15          Ms Dot lyrics that infused this scene or a good example of what I'm talking about. They sound a little bit like wind chimes. Something that could very well be in the space and match pretty well with the dancing. The light on the walls and you have the sound is so layered with faint computery noises that it could also be a machine somewhere in the room. It also serves as a kind of atmosphere at bed from which the clearly nondiabetic not in the world. Strings rise as Rachel enter

Speaker 1:          02:43          like even the dialogue has a lot of reverb giving it the same dreamy quality as the score and the sound effects. Becker, of course, reverberation is absolutely everywhere in blade runner. You could even say that. It's the manipulation of reverb that gives blade runner it's distinct feeling and the Vandellas is such a virtuoso at wielding it. The digital reverb that you hear in this movie was something relatively new to music at the time. The world's first digital reverberation machine, the emt to 50, was released only six years before blade runner premiered in 1982. We all have a natural sense of river. We hear it when we're in big spaces, how our voice reverberates and decays across the room. Digital reverb uses algorithms to extend that decay even more. The lexicon two to four, which is what Vangelis used for blade runner, could extend the up to 70 seconds, allowing you to make spacey a theorial. Sounds like this.

Speaker 1:          03:45          The emphasis on reverb accomplishes a few things. As I say, Andrew Stiller noted heavy river because it implies a huge enclosed hard surface space, creates a mood of mystery and paranoia, and also it gives everything a feeling of distance as if the audio is coming from far away, like in a dream. Finally, reverberation blends things together, and this is one of the crucial ways main Gellis fold separate audio sources into one oral master track because that is the goal here. Every scene is composed to create this cohesive acoustic environment. Sometimes the emphasis is on dialogue or sound effects. Other Times it's on the nostalgic music that calls back to classic film, except that Solo Saxophone was never actually used in classic film noir, which is a whole nother video, but anyway,

Speaker 1:          04:34          most of these scenes were interpreted by Ben Jealous on the spot. The way he composed the music for blade runner, it was by watching the freshly edited scenes on a screen in his studio and playing whatever they evoked in him at the time it used primarily the Yamaha cs, csad and analog synthesizer featured so prominently in blade runner that bank ellis has his own section in the CSAD wikipedia page. Even today, the CSAD is prized among audio files. It seems like anybody who ever writes about it describes it as a living, breathing thing that's partly down to the fact that the keys were pressure sensitive, so the sound that it produced as a marvelous acoustic quality in a way, it's the perfect instrument for blade runner, a machine with the ability to match the emotional weight of the real thing

Speaker 3:          05:17          in in one in one goal. You can have from that to that to that which is which different, again,

Speaker 1:          05:43          as much as possible, Vangelis used his spontaneous first take compositions and the result is a deeply personal reaction to the images. A second vision that fuses with the director's own is the great composer Ed Guard before him attempted to bring to life the complete sound profile of the city, interpreted through the genres of blade runner. Anybody who's lived in a large metropolis knows that sound is a constant feature there. At night you might hear a siren or a scream somewhere in the distance. We may not have wheezing or sputtering machines, but these days we sure have a lot of beeping ones vein Bella strings, all these disparate noises together with musical themes that are stunning and appropriate. When the music swirls, it says, if it's coming from within the characters themselves, like an internal cry or a release,

Speaker 1:          06:43          jelly evangelists isn't coming back. For Blade runner, 20, 49, his job is going to Johan Johansson, a great composer who's worked with director Denise Villeneuve three times before. I don't envy him. I mean everybody is going to be waiting for him to play someone else's iconic music. If I were him, I'd resist the urge to Mimic Vangelis completely. As much as I'd like to hear every classic note. Again, the sql deserves music as personal and human as its original. I'm excited to hear Johan Johansson is interpretation of a world that so many of us are so eager to return to
