Speaker 1:          00:02          What happened to post modernism, that great intellectual movement of the late 20th century, that question all objective conceptions of truth. What happened to it? Did it end? Most people seem to agree that yet it did end, but if you ask those same people when postmodernism ended, they can't really give you an answer. This may be due to the fact that the idea of postmodernism is still pretty fun. It's hard to define it except as a reaction to the modernism. It was created to refute that. Simplest way I can describe it is like this. Modernism was a movement at the turn of the 20th century dedicated to building coherent theories about all the new information science, philosophy and psychology or giving to us, and postmodernism was the period directly after that in which the authority of all those theories was challenged as well as the very notion of authority in the first place.

Speaker 1:          01:00          Postmodernism is a good catchall for all the various and chaotic ways of thinking that characterize the later part of the 20th century. But as we neared the millennials and the need to react to or refute modernism seemed less and less relevant, postmodernism sort of fell apart and we were left with, well nothing indeed. One of the key characteristics of our time is its inability to define itself with a set of intellectual ideas. Why is this? Why have categories like this broken down? Why don't they seem to suit the contemporary age? Is it because everything is just too chaotic now? Or is it because we have too much information and too much access for any one movement to congeal and rise to prominence? Yeah, I think that's probably true, but it only tells us so much. If we dig a little bit deeper, we can see that what's really changed is our relationship to history as science fiction author Bruce Sterling, one set history is not a science.

Speaker 1:          02:02          History is an effort and the humanities. What sterling means is that history, studying it or writing it or knowing it has always been a game of meanings. We look back in based on certain material facts and contemporary writings. Try to tell a coherent story about past cultures and their values, the meanings they ascribe to their time and existence. Now, modernism and postmodernism had something in common there. Access to history was enabled by paper, by books, books with covers and bindings, but more importantly with beginnings, middles and ends. Modernists and postmodernists thinkers had to resort to books. They had no other choice. They learned the authoritative sources on a given subject either to accept or refute them and by responding to the tradition they themselves became a part of it, but these are different times. The book was replaced, it was replaced with the network and the network doesn't respect history or tradition.

Speaker 1:          03:03          Let's say you want to know something about, I don't know the philosophy of stoicism. I bet the very first thing you would do is open up a search engine, probably Google and let a complex ever changing algorithm based on views, recency, filters, phrasing and much more prioritize. A list of results within that list are all kinds of different and contradictory positions all the way from top university professors to some guy on his couch and in each article there is usually a common section with opinions about those opinions. Then if you can find the author's name, you can go back to Google and type that in, see if you can somehow determine via their wikipedia page or number of twitter followers what other people consider the level of their authenticity to be, or you can just go to youtube, which I often do and see if someone's made a video about stoicism.

Speaker 1:          03:52          That's a little bit easier to digest. In the network culture. Everything is fluid, poorly organized, but extremely persuasive. Narratives accumulate, alter and change as quickly as Google's algorithm does and we have access to all of them instantaneously. Sterling and fellow author, William Gibson name this unnameable transition period of culture. A temporality in which we have this great unmooring from historical knowledge just makes for a lot of unease and our time, the maps we have, the network, the Internet, and all its social function can't seem to do its job. It can't map a strong master narrative onto the world we see in front of us now, maybe someday it will. Sterling gives it 10 years, but it won't look like any of the master narratives from literary culture. Really we have no idea what a master narrative in network culture could look like. Now. It's easy to see that such a disruptive break from the past also means and uncertainty about the future, about what progress looks like, a lack of confidence in the market in nation states, in groups of nation states like the EU and the belief that democracy can be exported around the globe are all symptomatic of this.

Speaker 1:          05:13          A temporal transition period in the world and in the arts. What you get is this collaging of past and future in the present, the repurposing of old structures and obsessions with predicted futures of the past. That never came about. I mean, what's more out of time, for example, then stuff like steam punk. It's tempting to see this new historical situation as a problem, but you can look at it as an opportunity to why not take up the whirling elements of the past and the future and design the contemporary moment that you want to see in art, in your personal life or in the public space. Then maybe the highbrow philosophy of the future can't be canonized. Maybe there never will be another Charles Dickens or George Orwell, but there's a great freedom in losing the Canon as well as sterling notes. Historians really used to worry that their interpretations of the past were clouded by their own values. Maybe the good news is that for us right now, we just don't know what our values really are so that whether we're looking back or looking forward, the a temporal age and the a temporal person can finally see with clear eyes.

Speaker 1:          06:31          I want to thank everybody so much. Who is pledged to the channel on Patrion. You're really making this possible. You know, I do this full time now and I've had such a great time focusing all my energy and effort on making I hope really, really great content for you and there's a lot more coming up. So if you haven't already, I want to ask you please to pledge to the nerd writer on Patrion as little as $1 per video. Everything helps. I mean, if a bunch of people do $1, it adds up. So don't be afraid to do a little if you only have a little. Thank you so much. I'm going to keep bringing stuff to you next Wednesday and if you want to check out my last understanding art, which is a poetry analysis, click around here. It's about later and the swan by WB yeats, one of my favorite poems ever. And I love that video. So, um, thank you so much again and I'll see you next time.
