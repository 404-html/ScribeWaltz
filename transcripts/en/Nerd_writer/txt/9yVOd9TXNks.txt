Speaker 1:          00:01          If Jonathan winters was never accused of anything, he's got the perfect alibi. He was someone else at the time when I first saw him before the show, and he was still trying to decide whether he could be a drunken Eskimo, the queen of the Vikings, or a door knob. I'd read it. He came out to begin with because when he's johnny winter cannot be in the wild, wild man, my friend Jonathan with

Speaker 2:          00:31          in my opinion, it's impossible to understand the genius of the late Robin Williams without first understanding the corresponding genius of his idol. Jonathan winters. Winters was the master of improvisational comedy from the early days of TV in his standup and various sketch appearances on talk shows. What he did was never scripted. The characters he invented. The scenes he enacted were plucked from the air in front of his eyes.

Speaker 3:          00:59          The kids had some candy and nation that did that. They come to the river. There's a barrier here and we will get some pictures of the bear. The bear ate together,

Speaker 1:          01:11          but we got some wonderful backdrop. One of winters,

Speaker 2:          01:14          most famous and simplest bits was called the stick from the Jack Paar.

Speaker 1:          01:22          What can you do a routine with you? Give them anything. Why am I went to a pretty good cash when I grind time, Margaret bloody dogs just up there, just this side of the green trailers.

Speaker 2:          01:54          Seven years later, another comedian did a very similar routine with a Pashmina on inside the actor's studio.

Speaker 3:          02:03          I came to Bombay.

Speaker 1:          02:04          Yeah,

Speaker 3:          02:11          we are going to cook octopus football.

Speaker 2:          02:19          Williams and Jonathan winters were kindred spirits. They work together for the first time on the TV show. Mork and mindy winters played his son, from which point they remained great friends until winters death in 2013, only a year and change it. Turns out before Robin Williams took his own life in this clip from a 60 minutes profile on winters, it's Robin Williams who expresses the great lesson that his mentor taught him. What was indeed the great philosophy of both their comedians.

Speaker 3:          02:48          Jonathan has just taught me about the world is open for play, is that anything and everybody is marketable in a wonderful way.

Speaker 2:          02:58          This, that the world

Speaker 4:          03:00          is open for play. It's an extremely rich one. It suggests rightly that humanity and our shared reality is made up of fluid elements of language and social structures which are sometimes codified into rules and pressures and laws, but that even the most rigid feature of what man makes can be turned flexible again and malleable again and funny with play winters and Williams saw reality for its basic elements and felt a grand freedom in their work to rearrange those elements into hilarious parodies of our world. Gosh, I was so taken with this guy. I was when I first first met him and I'm working Monday. We we did. We had a marvelous time. Your good days, you had access to more medication and will

Speaker 2:          03:51          williams exceeded. Even the master was in his dramatic scope. Not only could he create exaggerations of character in his comedy, but he had the ability to reproduce the subtleties of character as well.

Speaker 5:          04:03          Feeling like God put an angel on earth for you to rescue you from the depths of hell when you wouldn't know what it's like to be arranged, to have that love for her to be there forever.

Speaker 2:          04:16          In the end, both talents reflect the same empathetic observation of people, winters and Williams like no one else before or since understood the stereotypes in subtlety and the subtlety and exaggeration. It may seem as if this sublime energy of play passes away with them, but of course the opposite is true. We have that energy for all time because they gave it to us,

Speaker 3:          04:43          reverend angel, my hands or our credit because you can tell, but I just consider him not as hands anymore, but his paws. And be ready to do this. Get a little cat tree. Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid. My hands on your head now, but they're in my hands. Why would you put your hand on my head? Because that's not the America. Go with me to work with. Work with my demon spirit. Bobby. Get the extra hands straight out. Straight out. Now you can serve things. Go table 14. Able. Oh Man, I can't get them back that way. How do you get them back for it? Look horrible. This is called [inaudible] Syndrome. A tendency to be in a box for no reason, for horrible long periods and of to walk against the wind when there is no win. Why don't you please help a as a terrible thing to waste? You're really saying, not me as a terrible look at this. This also means surrender. So, so basically the Egyptian army training course. Okay, ready? Drop gun again. One time that I've done. Okay, gotten all this money.
