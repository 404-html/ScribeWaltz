Speaker 1:          00:06          The end of the 19th century, the cigarette existed at the center of a lot of different cultural forces. The one you're looking at right here is from a painting by Edvard Munch, most famous for another canvas called screen. This self portrait with cigarette may two years later, though less jarring is just as concerned with monks personal psychology and the dark underside of his identity as the scream is, but to his critics in his hometown of Oslow, the portraits dark. He's unfinished. Feeling was not only unfit for art, it was dangerous to the psychology of the city and the age as monks. Self portrait demonstrates he is by no means a normal man. When an artist is abnormal, a shadow is thrown over all his art. That's a quote by Johann Scharffenberger, Norwegian medical student who was echoing align of conservative moral thinking that feared the decay of society resulting from art like that monk and his contemporaries or making.

Speaker 1:          01:08          This pessimistic attitude was popularized in a large book called degeneration by this guy, Max, nor Nordell, who attacked pretty much every kind of art that wasn't up to his moral standards as poisonous and corrupting for Scharfenberg nor Dow. The cigarette was symptomatic of societies degeneration. It was along with alcohol, one of civilizations ugly indulgences, but for monk and his circle of decadent artists, the cigarette was something much different for them. The end of the 19th century also represented a change, but it was a chance for a break from the stale bourgeoisie values, the prudish and uptight conservative values of Nortel and his acolytes. In 18 nineties, Europe. The cigarette still wasn't all that popular. Only 10 years earlier, James Albert bond sack invented a rolling machine which made it possible to mass produce 200 cigarettes a minute, but they were still dwarfed by the sales of cigars and pipes.

Speaker 1:          02:06          The since the beginning when beggars in Spain took the discarded tobacco from Cigar Butts and reroll them. The cigarette had always been associated with the lower classes in the Crimean war. Soldiers Roll Tobacco and old newspapers, and by the 18 nineties when machine made cigarettes were cheaper to produce and by the working classes of Europe began adopting the cigarette while the middleclass especially the men stuck to their cigars. This lithograph by Thea fill steenland captures the feeling perfectly. Notice how the bourgeoisie man clad in his proper dress and hat uses his cigar to light the cigarette for the man with the loose color who is clearly of a lower social standing. It was in the lower classes that monk and his Bohemian contemporaries found their alternative to the suffocating middleclass value system. They traded in drawing rooms for late night cafes, dinner parties for nightclubs and cigars for cigarettes. Cigarettes became the essential prop of the Bohemian lifestyle in this painting by mentor Christian Kroger, you can see a 21 year old edvard monk lighting up with his friends and fellow painters in his studio in this etching by Moog himself.

Speaker 1:          03:12          Smoke snakes and fills up the atmosphere of a cafe where Bohemian intellectuals of both genders drink and debate art and ideas. In other words, everything Max nor Dow despised as critic Patricia Berman. Notes, Bohemians of the 18 eighties and nineties embraced the deviancy that people like Nortel assigned to them. They existed somewhere between the middle class and the NRC of the streets and their aesthetic revolt was the birth of what we can see now. Was cigarette cool for monks work. This meant moving away from the naturalism of his predecessors, the scientific recording of the natural world, even moving away from impressionism, which monks all as little more than formal exercises with light, his task would be to dig into his own psyche and record subjective experience. That's how you get something as terrifying as the scream. This is how dark subjectivity warps the natural world. As he wrote later, I was walking along the road with two friends.

Speaker 1:          04:14          The Sun was setting. Suddenly the sky turned blood red. I paused, feeling exhausted and leaned on the fence. There was blood and tongues of fire above the blue, black fjord and the city. My friends walked on and I stood there trembling with anxiety and I sensed an infinite screen passing through nature. You read any diary or memoir of a suffer of depression and you'll find similar moments of disturbing transformation. The truth is that mental illness was underscoring this whole transitional time in history. As nations came to grips with the rapid growth of anxiety, depression, mania, and other mental illnesses, different groups reacted in different ways. It's what's really at the heart of Nordhaus fears of degeneration. It's what a number of Bohemian artists of the era were attempting to explore in their work. The tragic relationship between madness and creativity is undeniable. Some ran from that fact.

Speaker 1:          05:09          Others refuse to look away. At this time, there was a kind of catchall term that's no longer really in use. Neurasthenia, something that's probably more akin today to acute anxiety or mild mania and here to the cigarette is significant because there was a belief floating around that cigarette smoking was one of the causes of insanity. A theory put forward in a book by Dr El Brammer called tobacco insanity and nervousness and another doctor, the surgeon Theodore Bill Roth, believed that the widespread cases of Neurasthenia and neuroses were due to alcohol and cigarettes. Now, if you look again at monks self portrait with cigarette, you can see a nexus of all these social constructions. Monk is aware of his critics, their belief in his degeneration and the cigarette as one of its causes. He uses it as a formal reason why the painting is nebulous. It's shrouded in cigarette smoke, but he's also using this dissolution by way of cigarette to signal the intersection between Bohemian life, mental illness and art, the prevalence of mental illness.

Speaker 1:          06:14          It's connection with genius and the failure of Bourgeoisie moralizing to come to grips with these realities. He encoded the cigarette as a complex symbol through which he asserted his complex identity and created a site of recognition for those who suffer today because the problem of mental illness has only grown and its growth has grown to and we're not that much more enlightened as to its causes than we were then. But I think that monks work is the constellation because it proves that our confusion about mental illness in medicine and science will always be matched by a probing and nuanced understanding and art of all kinds. Hey everybody. Thanks for watching. Welcome to my new apartment in Los Angeles.
