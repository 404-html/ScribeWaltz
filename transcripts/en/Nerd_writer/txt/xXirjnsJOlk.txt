Speaker 1:          00:10          Good friends at gibbons wrote of ancient Rome that the devout polytheists, though finally attached to his national rights, admitted with implicit faith, the different religions of the earth, fear, gratitude, and curiosity, a dream or an omen, the singular disorder or a distant journey perpetually disposed him to multiply the articles of his belief and to enlarge the list of his protectors. Holly theism is a chaotic and historically beautiful condition. It's not so hard to imagine our forefathers of antiquity devoid as they were of explanations for earthquakes or debilitating diseases stars. It's not so hard to imagine them assigning these mysterious forces a percentage, a deity, of what else distinctly human shape and character whose job it was to oversee this or that sphere of existence. This way of thinking is called [inaudible], in which the world and its forces are described by stories of holy origin. When the mythical man wants to explain the universe, he does it based on God's and powers, and if he is a more elegant thinker in fiction and allegory, the worldview of mythos and polytheism is necessarily disordered and archaic. There need be no unifying principle to connect things because the universe as such is at the caprices of these gods and goddesses who to read the poetry about them agree about as much as we human story.

Speaker 2:          01:31          No. Now there's

Speaker 1:          01:32          one institution that can exist in a world dominated exclusively by Mythos, and that is the institution of science. Why? Well, because we know that the foundational principle of science is the principle of no contradiction. In other words, it's scientific theory is only valid until a contradiction is found. In which case set theory must be revised or scrapped. Nothing in polytheism resembles this kind of logic. Contradiction in mythos is totally acceptable, so we're. Does science come from well, this is perhaps the greatest irony of all science proceeds historically from monotheism, a belief system held originally by the Jews, that there was one all powerful God from who's massive. Mine comes. The uniform ordered universe makes sense, doesn't it? For Science to work, it must assume that the universe is organized by a unifying principle and idea that doesn't appear until the early sixth century BC when exiled Jews in Babylon begin the process of redacting the many texts of the Hebrew tradition into what became the old testament was failing as a pre socratic Malaysian philosopher of the same era who saw that such a reduction, the singular texts and the singular God it described suggested the principle of no contradiction.

Speaker 1:          02:43          If God created a universe, then it had to be ordered and uniform and so in the person of families and the subsequent socratic thinkers, the famous transitioned from myths. Those two logos takes place. Logos is a way of explanation concentrated around argument, what aristotle later formalizes as logic in which an or can be brought around to the other side of a logical disputes simply by being shown the contradiction in his argument. It's humbling to know the close causal historical connection between monotheism and modern science. That connection modern scientists are low dimension. The truth is that science is as firmly rooted in belief as religion. It cannot work without the assumption that the universe is ordered and follows the rule of no contradiction like science says it does. Now, as a postscript, you may be asking yourself, does this mean that religion is as valid and epistemological system as sciences? They are both based on belief. Well, there is a very simple answer for that. No
