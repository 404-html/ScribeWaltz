Speaker 1:          00:00          What did you do to me? Your body won't last long in, stuck in there for the rest of your life. You'll get me out of here. You son of up and down her cat. I hate cats. Crappy movies suck. Obviously. I hate to waste my money or my time on something that is truly bad like suicide squad, that where every decision seems to be made for maximum shit. He tells me a whole lot. It's a shame, but in the end, I think crappy movies are an inevitable part of the cinematic ecosystem. You're not ever going to get away from them and whether or not they make money, some of which unfortunately do. No one is setting out to make a movie that is a piece of crap. I'm talking about a completely plus bottle

Speaker 2:          00:43          cough syrup. That's like six bucks.

Speaker 1:          00:50          What's more insidious in my opinion, are movies that are just passable. Films just good enough not to be terrible. I mean passable films, they aren't bad. They might even be better than okay, but there are a far cry from great or noteworthy or something that you would like to see more than once that the cinematic equivalent of this image, they don't fall apart, but their balance is always precarious. In the last handful of years, my annoyance with passable movies has steadily increased in proportion with their steadily increasing number. Passable films like to multiply. They do just enough for the audience and just enough for the studio and just enough for the stars. They have no problem being funded. Stop, stop. I need to know what is happening right now. For a long time, I've attributed the major problem with passable movies to a lack of tonal control. The emotional logic of the narrative in films like these often often feels a bit out of whack either. The film tries to be too many things at once leading to unintended emotional confusion. Don Friends as well,

Speaker 2:          01:51          Governor Nix this unit has been authorized, is pristinely. That's enough. That's enough

Speaker 1:          02:10          for the filmmakers. Give characters traits that don't belong to them in order to serve some plot function. What has it been this they're so fun to watch without the end? Many millions of people with no what and that's just the first two weeks of January or emotional arcs initiated early in the story are abandoned without comment, often proving in the end to be entirely pointless in good movies. Everything points to everything else. Emotional arcs of the characters, the scenes, the imagery, the music and the plot are tightly entwined and this doesn't just go for high brow movies by the way, whenever you hear someone say, have a lower brow film that it knows what it is. What they're really saying is that the film was totally focused, but recently I've begun to notice another unifying feature of passable movies. Indeed, of all passable storytelling and to understand what I mean, take a look at.

Speaker 3:          03:11          I gotta say feels really good to have somebody looking out for me. I got your back. I like that, and I got your back too. Hey Doug. I like you man. Thank you. A great guy. I just want you to remember that this is a business relationship. Doesn't mean that we're going to be best friends. That's not how this story is just an employee with a job to do. I got it. My best friend, and you're just my best man.

Speaker 1:          03:43          It doesn't mean that we're not going to have a good time though I sat, I got it. You're anybody's best friend for price, but nobody's winning account.

Speaker 1:          03:53          All the beats in the short scene should be familiar to us. We've seen them all before, but there's something odd going on here. See, stories are almost always about people or aliens or gods or animals or robots that act like people and great stories are always the ones that observed people truthfully, the ones that capture human experience with nuance and insight and the best stories make such acute observations about humanity that they can show us things about ourselves that we didn't know or teach us how to articulate those things against a vast unintelligible anxiety, and this I think is the big difference between great movies and passable ones. When passable movies observe human experience, they observe it not through the lens of real life, but through the lens of other movies. Love is my life. No love is your job.

Speaker 1:          04:49          No, I think you're threatened by what zoe and I have because you're afraid I won't be able to hang out every night. You were my drug dealer. There's one reason we know each other. I like the drugs you sell. That's it. There is this huge library, this huge vocabulary of actions built up over the years that people you know don't really do, but which happens so often in TV and movies that they're familiar enough to an audience that they become well passable for human motivations. I'm not saying it's bad for filmmakers to site or pay homage to the movies that they love in their own work. I'm saying that too many films released today are being cobbled together from a weird alternate reality that is only a dim echo of our own. It does not believe in fairy tales about Chakras or energy with a power belief. There is no such thing as spirit. This is the longterm danger of cliche. The more we allow it to happen, the harder it is to escape, the more difficult it is for audiences and writers to tell the difference. The last thing we want is to see our own lives through the Lens of art. That's only passable. New perspectives are what we need. Originality is what we should encourage you at every chance. Otherwise, I'm afraid our movies and ourselves will change into something quite different. What's it called? The imitation game.
