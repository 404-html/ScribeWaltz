Speaker 1:          00:03          So the original star wars trilogy episodes four, five, and six has a total run time of six hours and 20 minutes. Each movie is pretty much the same length, a little over two hours, and they're also the same in another respect. The amount of time that they feature the series main villain. Darth vader in terms of actual screentime vader, gets astonishingly little in a new hope. He's in the film for only eight minutes in empire strikes back. He's in it for 12 minutes and in return of the Jedi, he tops out at about 14 minutes on screen, but these altogether and darth vader maybe cinemas most iconic villain, if not character in general, flashed across movie screens for a total of only 34 minutes. In this video, I want to take a look at vader's visual footprint in the original trilogy to see if we can't locate what gives him this iconic status in such a short time.

Speaker 1:          00:57          In episode four, Darth Vader is only in six percent of the movie and his scenes are striking in how the character fades into the background both narratively and visually. For the bulk of episode four or Vader is portrayed as the subordinate of grandma off Tarkin, so a good portion of his screen time has him in the background or off to the side, cut off, sometimes out of focus even when he's being filmed directly. Vader's black uniform feeds into the shadows of the set and there is a noticeable lack of separation between foreground and background. Now it's hard to say how much of this is a narrative or thematic choice and how much is down to the constraints of filming all of Darth vader scenes in episode four with the exception of the first take place in or around the deathstar Gilbert Taylor, the cinematographer, was famously annoyed with filming these scenes because he didn't like the black and gray sets made by John Barry, which provided little opportunity for targeted lighting.

Speaker 1:          01:56          Taylor was actually forced to cut holes in the sets and outfit them with courts lamps that lit the environment evenly for flexibility in shooting flexibility but not specificity. This is not to say that darth vader doesn't make an impact in episode four. I mean, this is the film that launched the whole thing, and visually the movie does make a bold statement out of the gate by introducing vader right away as a menacing jet black presidents against the white interior walls of a rebel spaceship, but I do think that there's more iconic vader imagery to come. You see that right away. In episode five, the Empire strikes back the first time vader appears on screen. You get this iconic helmet shot from behind. What's so cool about this shot is that it's essentially black on black and yet director Irvin Kershner and cinematographer Peter [inaudible], find a way to make vader stand out with reflections and texture and shape all throughout the film.

Speaker 1:          02:53          They find ways to key into the elemental quality of Vader as an archetype or representation of evil, and they upped the ante on the work done. And episode four in that movie, vader's helmet, for example, is dirty smudged used. This might have something to do with Lucas's desire to have a naturalistic documentary feel to the movie. Something he often argued about with Gil Taylor, but an empire. The helmet is as smooth as volcanic glass and always spotlessly clean so that it features these fat white reflections which highlighted shape Kirschner, and so she seemed to understand that visually vader increased in dramatic weight. The less naturalistic and more pure that he seemed after all, the most iconic symbols in our culture are the ones that can be boiled down to their basic shape and still be instantaneously recognizable. Episode five takes advantage of this with the masterful use of silhouette. It's in these moments that vader transcends his role as a character in a movie and becomes a symbol for something much deeper and much more universal.

Speaker 1:          03:59          The empire strikes back, I think is inventive with it's darth vader imagery in a way that both of the other films aren't as much with only 12 minutes of screen time. The filmmakers do a lot to add to the mystique of the character and the film features those images of vader that have seared themselves onto my mind. From the very first time I watched episode six, return of the Jedi largely holds onto that pristine look from empire. It even copy some of the empire shots exactly, but overall Jeddah is less inspired when it comes to Darth vader cinematography. He often looks flat against backgrounds and the framing and lighting isn't nearly as compelling as Kirsch nurse work on episode five, Kershner was so devoted to his own vision that he didn't shoot master shots, which meant that Lucas would have to edit the scenes roughly how Kirschner intended them.

Speaker 1:          04:48          By most accounts, Lucas' hired Richard Markwan as a sort of working man's director for episode six, somebody who could bring the film in on time and within budget and give Lucas enough options to construct the film in the edit. As a result, episode six lacks the character work that was a signature of [inaudible] style, or what jetblue does give us is that famous final scene where Darth vader is finally unmasked. It's a moment that brings the archetype down to earth. The actual face of evil is just the face of a broken man, more pathetic than anything, and then that way deeply human. Of course, the legacy of Darth vader is an all in the visuals, the writing, the costume, and James Earl Jones vocal performance contribute hugely to the characters, continued faint, even his breathing is iconic, but film is a visual medium and when all these things are wrapped in the right image, the effects can be mythic. What's amazing is that Lucas Kirschner achieved this in just a handful of minutes and the impact for itself.
