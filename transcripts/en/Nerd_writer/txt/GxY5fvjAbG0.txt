Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello little turtles and Octopi coffee on a Tuesday and blog, 54

Speaker 1:          00:17          at night. I often wonder what I imagined is not an uncommon reverie. If there are aliens out there on planets orbiting distant stars looking up and wondering the exact same thing. If they have evolved like us to build massive powerful telescopes, they of course see turning the lens in our direction, the great spiral that is the Milky Way, a kind of motion in celestial stillness, but that's not all dates. Zooming out a bit more, they'd catch a pair of bright clouds looking almost like children chasing each other in empty space around their parent galaxy. Older and larger sibling would appear about a 10th as bright as the Milky Way and the smaller siblings about a fourth, as bright as that. These are the magellanic clouds just to have over a dozen satellite galaxies are orbiting the Milky Way. What makes these two so distinct is that unlike their brethren, there are still alive with the materials necessary for making stars.

Speaker 1:          01:08          In fact, the larger Magellanic cloud is so fertile, it boasts the largest stellar nursery in our local group. Beating out the vastly bigger Andromeda galaxy and even our own Milky Way. Most galactic satellites are dead in this respect. The Gargantuan Gravitational Force of the parent galaxy usually robs them of their gas in a process known as titled, stripping. Without gas, there can be no stars. These dark dwarf steroidals are the haunted houses. Have a galactic subgroups, so faintly do they move across the sky that the first one discovered the sculptor tour in 1938, was mistaken for a fingerprint on a photographic plate. Why then or the Magellanic cloud still viable? Well, new data from the Hubble is starting to reveal some clues. Yellow astronomer, each a colleague whose name I've just murdered, says that there are likely passing us for the very first time. This means their orbits once thought to be one to 2 billion years around the Milky Way might be much, much longer. They only got close to us. It seemed some 200 million years ago, which is to say just now, for all that previous time they were as the man indeed and astronomer named Martina Bates, left from Columbia University thinks that the smaller cloud actually smashed right through the larger initiating an accelerated star creation and leaving many of its own stars

Speaker 2:          02:29          behind. And you know,

Speaker 1:          02:37          as I was reading this article in scientific American from which I learned many of these things,

Speaker 2:          02:42          I had a thought.

Speaker 1:          02:44          I was thinking how noteworthy it is that the mechanics of nature so mimic the emotional mechanics of our lives. I mean,

Speaker 2:          02:55          have you ever

Speaker 1:          02:56          smashed right into somebody? Have you move through someone and not afterwards retained some of their own stars? Do we not like these brilliant clouds leave a trail of ourselves in the wake of our movement through the world? What is this parallelism between nature and humanity? I began to think the mighty heaven says, the philosopher PROC lists exhibits in its transfigurations clear images of the splendor of intellectual perceptions. And as the Magellanic clouds move closer in their transit to the Milky Way, the nearer is pulled away from its partner and left at such a distance, as would make it impossible for the dance to continue. The lesser fractured from its earlier collision will hurdle in the dark to a gas lists fate and empty nursery, some haunted fingerprint on the photographic plate. The Universe is the externalization of the soul wherever the life is that bursts into appearance around it. Our science is central and therefore superficial. The earth and the heavenly bodies, physics and chemistry, we sensually treat as if they were self existent. But these are the retinue of the being that we have. Emerson, the poet.
