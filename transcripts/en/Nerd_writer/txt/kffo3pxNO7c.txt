Speaker 1:          00:07          I carry your heart with me, high county it in my home. I'm never without it. Anywhere I go, you go. My idea and whatever is done by only me is your doing my daughter. I fear no fate for you are my fate, my suite. I want no world war. Beautiful. You are my world, my crew and h you a whatever a moon has always meant and whatever his son will always saying is you. Here is the deepest secret. Nobody knows. Here is the root of the root and the Bardo, the bug and the sky and the sky. The tree called light which grows higher than so ken, Whoa or mind can hide, and this is the one. It's keeping the stars a park. I carry your heart. I carry it in my house

Speaker 2:          01:32          of all the many highly experimental poems by e, e Dot Cummings. I carry your heart with me. I carry it in is among the most straightforward and approachable. It's the one you're most likely to hear at weddings or at weddings. In romcoms. I carry your heart with me. I carry it in my heart and because this poem seems effortless, it feels pulled out of time too. I think that was what I wanted to make this poem, universal quintessential love poem for the Modern Age. I mean, just take a look at the five concrete images that he uses. Hearts, Moon, Sun, tree stars. It's hard to imagine five symbols more archetypal, so the intention here is clearly universal appeal, but that's not a slight on the poems. Construction or it's meaning just the opposite. In fact, as Yates once brilliantly wrote about his own craft, align will take us hours maybe yet if it does not seem a moment's thought, our stitching and unsticking has been not.

Speaker 2:          02:41          So. First, let's take a look at the formal construction of I carry your heart. The first thing to notice is that the poem is split into two overlapping parts. Everything that's outside the parentheses and everything that's inside them. This follows the theme setup in the first line, the theme of the narrators lover being contained within his heart and vice versa. This reciprocal relationship is hammered home in the first stanza with anywhere I go, you go and whatever is done by only me is your doing. Every statement in this poem is followed by a parent theoretical statement and frequently keywords used outside of them are found inside as well. Linking the two parts and the two people. Parentheses are the perfect punctuation to use because visually they actually represent the image of containment. It's critic Roy. Tarkovsky has observed cummings find several poetic functions from the parentheses throughout his work, whether it's to convey intimacy or protection or to give a direct address to the subject or like we just discussed to use it's crescent shape as an icon in itself.

Speaker 2:          03:49          The neatest Tarkovsky notes, parentheses have a somewhat contradictory place and all our writing formally, they're supposed to contain throwaway information stuff that would theoretically be perfectly okay to leave out what? Because of this, because they don't have to be there and yet still our parents political comments call attention to themselves for grounding their content swell, backgrounding them at the same time. Ambiguity like that is exactly what cummings loves to play with and it reinforces the poems, themes. Clearly Cummings is using the parents medicals for intimacy. You can see that in his additions of my dear, my darling, my suite, my true, but he also uses them to develop his philosophy of self and love. See, for Cummings, love is a condition in which to fragmented selves come together to form a more perfect unity and if there's one great theme in his collected work, it's the importance of being a truly transcendental he alive individual against the doling and alienating forces of modern progress, but the individual self was always a problematic idea for cummings.

Speaker 2:          04:57          Whereas sometimes he evolved. That man is a miraculously whole human being elsewhere. Like in the same sentence, he says that man's only happiness is to transcend himself again and again. His poetry affirms that transcendence comes with losing the self in love. Whether it said gracefully outright, like when he writes, losing through you what seemed myself, I find selves unimaginably mine or it's demonstrated in some formal fireworks like in this poem where the you and me is literally fused together and the speaker has difficulty determining what form of the verb is best to use. Loves ability to transcend is the focus of I carrier heart and cummings is using whatever he can to explore it. Different connotations of transcendence. Just take a look at the third stanza. Love is literally a cosmic force that holds the stars in the firmament, but it's also the deepest secret and coming suggests this deepness by nesting, the secret in parentheses, which are themselves nested into the poem, and the secret is buried further in the root of the root and the bud of the bud and the symbols I mentioned earlier, son and particularly moon, are symbols of transcendence throughout his poetry.

Speaker 2:          06:18          I mean what has the moon always meant to cummings in a great essay by cummings critic Martin Hooser, which I'll link to below the moon. Significance is traced across several poems. It's variously described as a remarkable splinter, dainty madden was watch spring, a balloon, a big red dog mystery as having small hands, and as the shyest metaphor, cummings has a transcendental reverence for the moon, but he has a hard time pinning it down in language. That's why it's the shyest metaphor, many then he attempt to understand it, to know it will result in the symbol fleeing further away. This is what the moon has always meant to cummings and it's the way he feels about love and poetry too, in his notes which are collected at Harvard, he once wrote to know is to possess and any fact is possessed by everyone who knows it. Whereas those who feel the truth are possessed, not possessors like the great American transcendentalists. Cummings believes truth in poetry and love cannot be comprehended, only experienced with his poetry and all its intense experimentation. He attempts to short circuit our impulse toward knowing so that we might experience language. A new I carry your heart is a rare attempt at clarity and form and content. It points toward love just as it points toward cummings philosophy, but it's true. Magic is in the way it unfolds effortlessly in a rhythm and cadence. Harmonious with feeling.

Speaker 2:          08:00          Hey everybody. Thanks for watching. I want to point you guys in the direction of a channel that I really love wisecrack we've been pushing back and forth to each other because I think if you like my stuff, you're definitely going to love what they do. They do eight bit philosophy, thug notes, but I've really been loving earthling cinema, which is like film analysis from the perspective of a crabby but hilarious earthling from the future. I'm a, I don't know. I'm a sucker for high concept stuff and it's really smart. Um, anyway, go to their channel. Watch this one that they just did on Mad Max, which is really good. Um, and subscribe and tell them the nerd writer sent you in comments. Um, yeah, they're, they're just good people. Uh, anyway, if you want to, to the nerd writer directly, you can click right here. Go to my patrion. Um, I just started a blog on patriots. So if you a pledge dollar per video, you can get access to that, some behind the scenes stuff. That's cool. Um, anyway, I'll see you guys next Wednesday.
