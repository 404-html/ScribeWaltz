Speaker 1:          00:02          Why is David fincher? In my head, I was thinking about this a lot while watching his new netflix series, mind hunter, I'd watch an episode or to go to the kitchen to get a drink and everything would look. Fincher, ask like my eyes were mimicking his camera movement somehow. First I was creeped out, then I was impressed and then it was curious what about his filmmaking causes this effect because there are plenty of other amazing stylistic directors whose visual styles don't hijack your census like venture does, and it's the same with all his movies and TV shows. I checked, I went back through all of them to see if I could locate the source of this quality and I think I found it here.

Speaker 1:          00:46          Did you see that? It's a very small thing and it's easy to miss, but the more I watched fincher's work, the more it stands out as a key element of his visual language. What is it exactly? Well, it's a camera move. In this case, the tilt, in this case, a pan in this case, a tracking shot, and in this case all three these things are the most common tools and the filmmakers toolbox. You can find them in pretty much any film you watch, but fincher has a very specific way of using them which falls in line with his reputation as a perfectionist. Essentially what he tries to do is have the camera exactly match the velocity and direction of the moving character in the frame. When the character stops, the camera stops and starts again. When the person starts to move again, but the matching movement here isn't just clothes.

Speaker 1:          01:34          It's perfect, so perfect. In fact, that it must involve some kind of time to rehearsal with the actors, which I learned when I tried to do it myself earlier. This is no doubt a part of the reason why fincher is known for doing so many takes. It takes patience and a good camera operator to get these moves exactly right and they're happening all the time, everywhere in little shots in between shots, shots. You notice in shots you don't and whether they register or not, the effect starts to accumulate in your mind. All of a sudden fincher's reality is your reality. Now, I think there's a very good reason why this happens and it's a bit counterintuitive when you consider that fincher's camera work is often regarded as impersonal or coldly omniscient even by fincher himself, and I think that's somewhat disingenuous because what these shots do is effectively lock you in to the behavior of the characters.

Speaker 1:          02:24          You really feel it when someone moves around the space that they're in. Even small gestures like a shrug or deflated shoulders. Even the slightest change in posture is registered by this camera. In this way. I think pinterest cinematography is a lot more personal than even he makes out. It might happen just below the level of consciousness, but a much more in sync with this character than I am with, for example, this character. It's funny, fincher's actors have to move in these very deliberate lines at steady speed's probably ironed out by rehearsal, but the result, at least for me, is a greater connection to the character than something that is more free form. Less exact. I mean, it's no surprise that fincher would pay attention to details like this. Listen to the advice he gave Robin Wright when she directed her first episode of House of cards.

Speaker 2:          03:11          Every scene you direct, every scene you act in, it's the same thing. What's that? He said, behavior over time, it's a fraction. So behavior is the most important thing of every piece of material that you read, that you performance and you direct. Look at the behavior,

Speaker 1:          03:33          David. Fincher is obsessed with behavior. He knows that the way a person moves is a key part of who they are and what they want. He knows that if a person is running and the camera follows that running exactly, then it's like the audience is running too. He knows that the truth of aspiration is in the speed. Someone lurches forward. He knows that fear can express itself in exactly how slow someone stands up or that when a person floats back in astonishment, the camera should follow up with them. It's not a coincidence that emotion has the word emotion. Emotions express themselves physically. What fincher does is put his camera in lock, step with the body to capture that physicality, and as a result, we developed this almost unconscious connection with these characters, but the trick works almost too well. You start to notice behavior and movement in the real world, but in the way that fincher stages then deliberate, steady and precise for a little while. At least David fincher hijacks your eyes.

Speaker 1:          04:39          Hey everybody, thank you so much for watching my video on fincher. If you want to learn more about him, I definitely recommend watching my friend Tony's video on what he doesn't do, his movies, which is super interesting. Also, Captain Christian did something on the invisible digital effects in venture films. I'll link both of those below. Definitely watch those.
