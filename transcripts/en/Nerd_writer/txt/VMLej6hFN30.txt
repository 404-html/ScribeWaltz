Speaker 1:          00:13          The first thing you notice about Michael Mann's heat is that it's all long lenses in a widescreen 23 by nine format meant to allow for a broad scope so that you can see more man crowds, his subjects into the frame as if you were always watching them on a stakeout from some hidden vantage on the building opposite the telephoto Lens is really the perfect lens for this film. It has the effect of keeping everything at a distance all at the same time, separating people from the background while also at the same time turning the background into an almost liquid plane of lights. Evoking that fantastical romance that is always found in new war and which Michael Mann seeds in the sprawl of Los Angeles. This is all to say that the telephoto Lens is both functional and stylistic and he two words that could be used to describe the driving ethos behind man's work. Of course, style is never something Michael Man's been accused of.

Speaker 1:          01:17          In fact, it's likely accusations of empty stylistics from the days of Miami vice that made man insist that he wasn't a genre film at all, but it drama drawn from the stories of a real life detective who served as a consultant on the film, and it's true, the procedural and mundane elements of police and criminal activity are painstakingly rendered and heat and there's a pride in the fact that the locations are real locations in La. This was an actual cardboard community on terminal island. This train that the neuro gets out of his, the Real Blue Line of the Los Angeles Mta and his house is a real house in Malibu by the sea, but man can't hide his knack for and devotion to style. The three locations I mentioned may be real places, but it's not an accident that in the first a giant mound of yellow sulfur gives the space a dreamlike quality or that the train platform feels both alien and alienating.

Speaker 1:          02:14          And as for Deniros home, what could call attention to itself more than this blue suffused box of loneliness cribbed from Alex Coleville, 1967 painting Pacific. In other words, despite Michael Mann's protestations, that this is not a genre piece, he is clearly drawing from both crime and the war traditions. What makes the film brilliant is that, uh, uses its style and realism to comment on each other, and in doing so, updates the genre for a new age. A lot of this is done through sound in the film by the great work and Chris Jenkins sound design and Elliot Golden Falls Score. The interplay is established right at the start as golden falls, spacey, highly stylized score fades into the hyper real sounds of a hospital and that exchange is in the soundtrack for the scene where Pachino chases down to near on the highway man uses a joy division song called new dawn feeds that has a driving rhythm that gets the moment

Speaker 2:          03:19          perfect.

Speaker 1:          03:28          But what I just played, that's actually not the song used in the movie, man commissioned a cover of new dawn, fades by the electronic artists, moby who super adds to this functional moment, a layer of pure style. Listen to the difference.

Speaker 1:          03:53          Since its beginning, there has been a tension and feel new war between realism and style. It's origins in black and white and harsh chiaroscuro lighting attempted to communicate a gritty realism, but in this lady in the implicitly abstract nature of black and white, it created a style all its own. It's values, however, we're always traditional from the start and the war has investigated the way men construct their identities from what they do that reflected the broad scope of men in the early 20th century, not just cops and robbers, but the rise of postmodern consumerist culture of new ways to build identity that weren't from one's career or one's relationships made, the crime films association with style more problematic, but also more necessary. Man Confronts this head on with Deniro and Chinos characters, Deniro style, his slick suits his minimal empty house, reflect his lifestyle of extreme professionalism, matched in the actual culture of the eighties when the film was first conceived, but Geno tube is placed in the actual home of postmodern architect.

Speaker 1:          05:03          Thom Mayne in Santa Monica man knows that to communicate with contemporary audiences, to make a crime noir that is fresh and looks forward, these stylistic choices have to be present. Modern audiences firmly entrenched in this culture register style. They speak themselves through style and it's through this attention to style that he can finally level a critique on its own culture. In the end, Deniro and Pachino ultimately reject these new forms of identity construction. You can lounge around here on her sofa in her ex husband's dead tech, post modernistic bullshit house if you want to, and they fall back on traditional methods, but Chino looks to his work and Deniro looks to relationships.

Speaker 2:          05:49          There's no point in going anywhere

Speaker 1:          05:55          in this way. Michael Man's to style in score, in soundtrack, in lenses, in locations, in wardrobe, in lighting, and his attention to realism in all those same categories. Serve to illustrate a new social environment as well as its drawbacks and that's what Phil knew aura was always meant to do at its best show the underside of culture and why it's unnecessary. Extension of the reverse. In fact, it may be the case in our modern culture that when the two sides are put face to face, they don't look all that different. Hey everybody, thanks for watching. He is one of the best crime thrillers of all time. No question about that. I just want to say that 2015 has been the best year of my life. Uh, you guys have helped me expand this channel to something that I never could have imagined that a fact that I get to do this full time is just beyond my wildest dreams.

Speaker 1:          07:00          I believe in this channel so much. And when the work that's happening here and I really believe that to exist in 2016 and beyond, it has to innovate and experiment and do new things. And that is what I'm looking forward to doing and looking forward to giving to you. There's a really special relationship between the people who watch this channel pleasure, this channel on my patrion page and me because there's nothing in between us. And that's a model that I talk about after every video. But one that I really, really, really, really believe in because this content is not diluted by any corporation or any brand or anything like that. And that's, I think, really special and I think a new model for the way that content can be. So, um, I just want to say thank you for 2015. You guys have been awesome. If you do want to pledge, you can click right there and go to my picture on page. Um, I will see you guys next Wednesday in 2016 and hopefully an exciting year to come.
