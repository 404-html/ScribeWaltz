Speaker 1:          00:00          Animal crackers on the Tuesday and blog 29.

Speaker 2:          00:04          Ah,

Speaker 1:          00:14          so when we look at a map of the world, we see countries, countries divided up by very neatly drawn lines, lines which have a nice sense of finality to them, right? This land belongs to this country and that land on the other side of this line belongs to that one. Of course, we know that the geopolitical reality is anything but as conclusive as these lines suggest. We know that there is civil fighting, contestations of land and ownership, local loyalties, local hatreds, religion, sex and factions who can and often do flip their noses at straight lines drawn in comfy rooms by foreigners. At some time in the past, we've come to use and our global parlance, the word nation state to identify these places. It's a term we don't think too much about. We use it freely without going to our dictionaries, but the truth is, of course that nation state as a term quite often fails to adequately describe many of these countries where, for example, civil war is a continuing reality.

Speaker 1:          01:06          So maybe by pulling the term apart, we can get a better understanding of how these two words, nation and state can come together. Now the state is what can be defined by lines on a map. The area over which the state central power called the sovereign has controlled the sovereign in theory, has a monopoly on all the violence that occurs in the state and on the international stage. The sovereigns voice in theory is an equal among other saffrons. This is the basic definition of sovereignty, equal abroad master at home. It was John Bowden and the 16th century who first laid out these characteristics in his six books of the Commonwealth. Thereafter, Beaudin and others having worked at it's used, try to figure out where the source of sovereignty light, but and believed as was the custom of his time, that the sovereign then ruled by a king or prince was derived from God and political thinkers for the next two centuries continue to find the source of sovereignty and divine right or in the laws of nature or social contracts.

Speaker 1:          02:00          But by the end of the 18th century, a revolutionary new idea came to the fore. It said that the source of sovereignty lay not in the man upstairs, but in the many men and later women downstairs. In other words, the source of sovereignty was in the people. You see it loud and clear. In the very first line of the declaration of independence, when in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands, etc. Etc. OnE people. In other words, one nation. By this time the word nation had become synonymous with the word people. So here you have a state which finds the justification for its sovereign power, the monopoly on all the violence that happens within its borders, in the consent of the people, the nation, hence nation state. The questiOn becomes, how do you define a people?

Speaker 1:          02:46          What makes people a people? We have a number of problematic nation states in the world, places couched in what seems like unceasing violence, and to understand them, we must first understand how people develop a national identity. Now, there are a number of thIngs that groups can share. A language race or religion, but stronger than all of these is as John Stuart mill, the great liberal thinker said, and identity of political antecedents, a possession of a national history, a community of recollections, collective pride and humiliation, pleasure and regret connected with the same incidents in the past. A historical narrative, a national memory. This binds people closer together than any other common trait. Unfortunately, and as we know too well, the many millions of people who find themselves in a state very often don't have the same memory. Narratives diverged or rewritten mixed with myth and fiction as the years and decades pile on.

Speaker 1:          03:39          All of a sudden you have one state with two people or three peoples, and the proBlem grows. It took 400 years and a lot of blood for the island of Ireland to resolve issues between nation and state. Wasn't easy. Catholic, irish and protestant irish have very different memories of a national history full of conquest and subjugation. In 1921, the largely catholic southern part of the island declared itself independent from britain. the protestants being largely of british descent and who held power in the north had no desire to break from the uk, so a partition was built separating the irish free state from north Ireland. Good solution, right? Keep the warring factions apart. The only problem is that the catholic still in north Ireland became an ill treated minority. Here's a map showing the distribution of catholics and protestants in northern Ireland doesn't really suit straight lines on a map, does it?

Speaker 1:          04:28          Fortunately in 2007, the irish troubles were settled peacefully. However, this kind of conclusion isn't really the norm, though there is a partition, for example, on the island of Cyprus, the northern turkish cypriots and the southern greek cypriots haven't yet come to the same conclusion because the issues of nation and state there haven't yet been resolved, nor have they been resolved for kurdish muslims, the largest single group of people in the world who don't have a state of their own. Now we know of course that many kurds live in the northern part of Iraq, but few, if any, identify themselves as iraqi. The example that we're perhaps most familiar with is that of Israel and palestine. We know the hiStory and we know how each party writes the narrative and who's to say which is right. Just last saturday was landed and annual day of palestinian protest for an event in 1976 in which the israeli government plan to expropriate thousands of palestinian demands for security and settlement purposes.

Speaker 1:          05:21          One protester was killed, more, were injured and sent to hospitals. What are the remedies when you have to peoples living in a territory to which both can lay claim territories which are part of their history, their family history. Well, you can have external forces come in and try to referee the situation, but we've seen from firsthand experience how imperfect such illusions can be. How about partitions like in Ireland or Cyprus? Difficulty is. There's always gonna be people on both sides. We think the partition is unfair. What about population movement? It kind of ethnic cleansing where one people has to move to another place. It's a solution, but an extremely painful one, which who are forced to move, lose everything. All of these remedies are not lightly taken, but the sad truth is that they are often better than the alternative, which is endemic violence that feeds on itself.

Speaker 1:          06:08          Lessons here are feeble, but maybe this is the most important one. Violence of this kind produces precisely those experiences which pass into history, confirming, strengthening the identity of both sides. Worse violence of this kind produces people with a stake in it. Continuing, namely young men to whom such civil war becomes a way of life, providing a source of employment, excitement, adventure, and most importantly, purpose. Sovereignty is a problematic thing. It can often produce deeply depressing results, but if there's one thing that we can do as an international community, it's to try to understand the history and example of such cases to try to foresee and prevent new antagonisms before the violence that consumes them becomes a self generating monster.

Speaker 3:          06:59          Well,

Speaker 1:          07:00          you actually mentioned the manage to keep most of them in.
