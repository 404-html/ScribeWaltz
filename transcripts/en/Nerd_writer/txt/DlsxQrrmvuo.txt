Speaker 1:          00:01          Wait, where am I? Wait mcgriddles log, 11 thanksgiving time when we celebrate all where things were for a time for family, good food, a time to relax with a good football game and some beers. The holiday can be traced to a feast in 16, 21 on Plymouth plantation in Massachusetts was a good harvest year due in part to the corn growing skills taught to the settlers by squantum pawtuxet into quote Edward winslow

Speaker 2:          00:37          would be not always so plentiful as it was at this time with us. Yet by the goodness of God, we are so far from that we often wish you partakers of our planet.

Speaker 1:          00:48          It's at this time of year that I'm often reminded of Robert De Niro's great comeback movie of 2009. Everybody's fine.

Speaker 3:          01:09          No true, true apartment and no

Speaker 1:          01:28          wait, wait, wait, wait. What the hell is this? I just wanted to talk about. You're saying that I can't talk about Bobby [inaudible] great comeback role in 2009. Oh, so there's a bill in the House of Representatives right now called the Stop online piracy act or so. Not many people know about it, but those of us who have are Horcrux is online. You know that the Internet is and why are they doing well? It's because many of them believed that this Bill Sopa, which the house is very quickly and quietly trying to push through to passing, represents an infringement on their basic rights of free speech. Let's take a minute to understand what sofa is and how it works. Private companies, namely large corporations within the entertainment industry, the Motion Picture Association of America, the recording industry, Association of America, Netflix via content, the ability to shut down on unauthorized roque sites where people download tv shows music and move.

Speaker 1:          02:13          Now, they already have the right to do this under American copyright law on an individual basis. You may have seen this screen before, but a lot of these sites operating from outside the US and so are in each jurisdiction, so we'll will allow the government to force US Internet providers to block access to domain names that carry this. Con. Corporations can also sue under so, but any search engine that lists these sites and their result or any blog reform that provides the Linkedin, but sofa has another. This log is corporations and the government, the ability to choke the funding of websites by forcing advertisers and payment services, pay pow, mastercard, visa from doing business with them from the time the claim is filed, the service would have five days to separate the infringing website or risk persecution. What do you think payment service providers will do given the choice?

Speaker 1:          02:54          It's economic submission and Internet death panel. Copyright Law is certainly in port credit compensation should be provided to artists who sell their work under copyright. They deserve to be protect. The problem with sofas is that though protection isn't stated aim, the law won't be effective against content piracy. For example. He'll still be able to access block sites by entering the Ip address instead of the domain, but that's not all Sopa might actually work against its purpose. There's a thing you've never heard of called the domain name system. Security extensions or DNS SEC provides end to end encryption of domain name. Making sure that there's no break in the chain between say citizens bank and its customer, forcing Internet providers to redirect allegedly piratical sites to FBI servers is incompatible with that. Most experts believe that tampering with the internets registry of domain names will result in less security, not more in fact is that hackers and pirates have always had a way of binding cracks and circumventing laws despite efforts to stop what many fear about so, but is its potential to curb and discourage innovation in our most innovative industry.

Speaker 1:          03:52          The digital marketplace of ideas that welcomes every blog and tweet is the same one that inspires the next generation of innovators to fuel our economy. He will give corporations the ability to target startups, new search engines or new social media platforms if they feel that they're filtering isn't good at one lawsuit to a small fledgling company is usually all that it takes. Even established sites like Tumblr, youtube, soundcloud, and facebook could come under the gun. Any amount of illegal content could be enough to temporarily shut down the entire site and violators. That little baby who likes big. Okay. Or that guy who makes awesome acapella

Speaker 4:          04:41          that these

Speaker 1:          04:52          people could face jail time, don't send babies to jail. Representative Lamar Smith from Texas announced the legislation last month and it has bipartisan support. Also has bipartisan opposition on this issue. Nancy Pelosi and Ron Paul are on the same side. Google, facebook, twitter, Zynga, Zynga, Ebay, Mazzola, Yahoo, aol, and linkedin issued an open letter to key members of Congress last week stating that Sopa was a serious risk to our industries. Continue Track of innovation and job creation as well as to our nation cybersecurity, and it should be noted that the MPA, for example, is a relatively tiny workforce. When you compare it to the jobs created by the inner. I put links to petitions and information on what representatives you can call in the doodling. Now, there's a provision in American copyright law called fair. You get grants and exception to copyrighted material for the purposes of commentary, criticism, news reporting, research.

Speaker 1:          05:42          Here are the four factors used to determine whether or not use is fair. The purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes, the nature of the copyrighted work, the amount and substantial ability of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole and the effect or use upon the potential mark. So what about my use of Robert De Niro's? Great comeback movie of 2009. Everybody's fine. Was it fair? Okay. One purpose and character. Well, I'm using the clip to make a point for completely nonprofit purpose to the nature of the work. Well, it's a Hollywood movie. It's gross. Sixty dollars million, $454,850. It's budget $20 million. So I'm helping still on DVD. Okay. Number three, the amount used. Okay, so I used 38 seconds. Divide that by the run time of 99 minutes and you get my use of point zero, zero, zero, six, three, six percent.

Speaker 1:          06:36          Finally number four, the effect on potential market. Did you ever hear of this movie before? I mentioned it still on DVD. It's plain to see why fair use is critically important in our way. We are now a community of auto didact, taking the best soup of information and consolidating it into coherent stories. This is how we learned today. This is how we teach each other. This is how we start a revolution or take a stand or figure out where our efforts can be put to the best. This thanksgiving I'm grateful for. Fair use. Brought it full circle. I'm also grateful for friends and family and speaking of. I have to get out of here. Devin miscalculate. Okay.

Speaker 5:          07:16          Okay. Yeah. That's more like it.
