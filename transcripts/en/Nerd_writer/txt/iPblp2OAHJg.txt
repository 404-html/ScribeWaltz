Speaker 1:          00:07          Me,

Speaker 2:          00:13          my heart aches and a drowsy, numbness, pains, my sense of him like I had drunk and emptied some dough opiate to the drains in one minute past leafy words had some is that through envy of buy happy lot, but being too happy and nine happiness the Dow light when you're dry out of the trees in some melodious plot of beach in green and shadows. Number list, singer stuff. Summer in full throated ease.

Speaker 2:          00:48          Oh, for drafting vintage that has been cooled along age and the deep delving. Earth tasting of flora in the country. Green, dense and prevent style, song and sunburnt mirth. Oh, for beaker, full of the warm south, full of the truth, the blush, full hypocretin with beaded bubbles winking at the brim and purples stated mouth that I might drink and leave the world unseen and with the fade away into the forest and fade faraway dissolve and quite forget what thou among the leads has never known the weariness, the fever, and the fret here where men sit and hear each other grown. We're posey shakes. A few sad last gray hair is where youth grows pale and specter thin and dyes were but to think is to be full of sorrows and let denied despairs where beauty cannot keep her less resize or new love pine at them beyond tomorrow, away away for I will fly with the nut charioted by back, sent his parts, but on the swings of Posey, though the Dole brain perplexes and retards already with the tender is the night and happily the queen moon is on her throne, clustered around by all her story phase, but here there is no light. Say what? From heaviness, with the reasons blown through virtuous glooms and winding Masi ways,

Speaker 2:          02:32          I cannot see what flowers are at my feet, nor what soft incense hangs upon the bowels, but in embalmment darkness, guests each suite where with the seasonable month endows the grass, the thicket, and the fruit tree, wild white Hawthorne in the pastoral Eggland time, fast fading, Violet's covered up and leaves and mid maze. Eldest child, the coming must gross full of do we wind murmurs, haunt flies on summaries.

Speaker 1:          03:09          Darkling. I listened for many a time. I have been half in love with easeful death

Speaker 2:          03:21          called him names and many amused Ryan to take into the air. My quiet breath now more than ever. Seems it rich today to cease upon the midnight with no pain. Well that are pouring for thei soul abroad in such an ecstasy still would've stopped soon and I had ears in vain to high requiem become a site that was not born for death. Mortal Bird, no hung regenerations tread the down. The same voice I hear this passing night was heard in ancient days by emperor and clown, perhaps the self same song that found a path through the sad part of ruth when sick for home. She stood in tears amid the alien core in the same that oftentimes have charmed magic casements opening on the foam of perilous seas in fairy lands for Lauren. Very word. He's like a bell to tow me back from the to my soul self.

Speaker 1:          04:39          Do you

Speaker 2:          04:40          the fancy cannot cheat so well as she has failed to do deceiving. Uh, do you? Uh, do you buy plaintiff? Anthem fades past the near meadows, over the stream, up the hillside. And now is buried deep in the next valley glade.

Speaker 1:          05:01          Was it division

Speaker 2:          05:05          or a waking dream? Flood. Is that music?

Speaker 1:          05:15          Do I wake or sleep.
