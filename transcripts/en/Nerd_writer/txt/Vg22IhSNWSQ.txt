Speaker 1:          00:01          Coffee at 4:00 AM on a Saturday night and blog 28,

Speaker 1:          00:15          and so tonight we are on the set of my very good friend, Nolan as new short film Motel Blues. Tonight we're filming at the pear blossom motel up about 60 miles north of Los Angeles and we have the whole motel rented out for the night, which by the way is one of the coolest things about independent filmmaking and filmmaking in general is that you get to use real locations like this and repurpose them for your movie. Tonight I want to show you what goes into making a short film of this stature and one thing you should understand is that the only difference between this and a movie you might see at your local AMC is the amount of money in the budget. The way this film is being made is the way all films are made. A big budget blow. It might have, you know, more people on the crew, more freedom with time and locations and equipment, but all the necessary stuff is here and it's left like all films to the actors. The story, the filming techniques and the vision of the director, but let me, let me introduce you to the quick. Let's. Let's.

Speaker 1:          01:28          Okay, so first we had the unit production manager or ups whose job it is to manage the production from before the filming to after upm will create a working budget before principal photography and do her level best to make sure that the final cost, it doesn't go too much over the mark on smaller productions. The UPM is also responsible for hiring a casting agent as well as anyone else the crew might need. In short, this person's sails the ship as calmly as she can to ward principle photography when the assistant director or add assumes the job as onset organizer 80 maintains order on the set as hooligans from every department and run this way and that to arrange the shot, the 80 rights and sends out call sheets which are scheduled for the days of shooting and the 80 calls out necessarily commands before the shot starts.

Speaker 1:          02:13          It sounds sort of like this. Roll audio roll camera. Next we have the sound record is quite possibly the most overlooked, underrated, and important job on an indie film set. It's difficult to communicate just how much sound determines the way we perceive a movie. Filmmaking gets branded as largely a visual medium, but poorly recorded. Sam can destroy an otherwise great project to record good sound, good dialogue, which means recording all the many frequencies of the human voice. The record is used as a boom or lavalier mic to get as close to the actors' mouths as possible. This requires coordination with the DP and the director, making sure that they set up the shot so that the recorders can position his mic close, but at a frank. Next we have the and his assistant. The best board. These gentlemen are responsible for lighting a movie and as a film is essentially a combination of light and darkness.

Speaker 1:          03:07          They're responsibility is huge. Film lighting is exceedingly tricky because the camera lens sees differently than the I and the gaffer must understand that often irrational relationship between the two. When you have a talented one like our friend Justin here who can work quickly to produce stunning images, you simply put up with his embarrassing personality, Colby, Jack. Next we have hair and makeup and the art director. Hair and makeup is responsible for making the accurus look good and the art director has that same responsibility for the set. The Art director can take an otherwise blend space and create the appropriate mood with furniture, trinkets, whatever he can find. There's nothing and art director likes more than a thrift store full of other people's throwaway junk. Next we have the assistant camera people, those quiet warriors who serve as the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth, the hands of the DP.

Speaker 1:          03:53          The Camera Department must assemble the camera, attach it to whatever tripod or rig will be used for the shot and question and perform that daunting and also under appreciated task. No, as focus pulling, see a camera lens can only focus on one cross section of space away from the camera. It being a larger small cross section, depending on the lens and the light, if either the actors where the camera is moving during the shot, the noble focus puller must buy soft adjustments of the Lens, make sure the talent stays within the given cross section or depth of field. It's like a game. The most infuriating game ever created, all the work done by the gaffer. His assistant and the camera department is done to satisfy the demands of the director of photography or DP, working closely with the director and being his first partner. The DP determines the shot, how it will be lit, how the camera will move, what the framing will be, all in an effort to serve the needs of the story.

Speaker 1:          04:43          Everything a camera does is felt by the audience and the DEP must understand and manipulate the rules of composition that we might feel what the story wants us to feel. The DP directs our attention to what we need to see. The other job of the DP always make the actors look good. The of supply, the human element to it felt they take written characters and make them real for the audience to love or hate whatever the story demands. They are subservient to the director, but often is the case that actors being students of human behavior find a way to present their characters which the director would never have thought of in which in fact serve his ends better. It's important therefore to give actors freedom to find what's real in the dialogue and action written for them. After all, the audience will never see the script.

Speaker 1:          05:23          They will see the actors and nine times out of 10, the performances are what they'll be talking about on the car ride home and finally we get to the most important part of a film. The part on which everything else hinges. Craft services, yes. Where the food is. It's perhaps impossible to say what a film shoot can become if the crew is not satiated. It starts with whispers of maltreatment. Wines and backtalk sharp attitudes and chatting. Before you know it, someone is throwing a one k at the director's head for goodness sakes. Feed your crew if it's possible, spoil them. The respect and quality work you'll get in return will be worth it. And lastly, the director there will fill, might sometimes start it's journey to the theater at the pen of a screenwriter, and though in unhappy circumstances it may end its journey with the discretion of a producer.

Speaker 1:          06:10          There was no question that the artist of a film, the one whose vision the rest are trying to realize is the director in its purest form. A director plays all the parts I just mentioned that of writer director and trump card holder in large budget pictures. This is rarely the case and there have been plenty of fine films made in that system, but the characteristic quality of low budget film, especially no budget short films, is that necessity requires that the director does indeed play all these parts, including that of the editor. Here. We really get to see what's in the filmmakers heart and how he translates it to the screen.

Speaker 2:          06:46          The no escaping slaves like I can be submerged and God bless America. God bless America right.
