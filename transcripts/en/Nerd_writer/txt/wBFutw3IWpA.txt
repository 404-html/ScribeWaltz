Speaker 1:          00:02          Universities are often cited as mythologies of the modern era, Superman, spiderman, wonder woman, and the hulk. These are the new gods, the site and Apollo Zeus of our debt, but the strongest similarities between Greek myth and American comics have less to do with the characters or their supernatural powers than with an ever growing interweaving tapestry of story. There will be very little force, for example, in escalas is Oresteia the story of arrestees revenge on his mother Clytemnestra murder of her husband agamemnon arrestees father. If the story of Agamemnon had not already been told in homer's Iliad, the dark family history of Agamemnon is assumed in escalates. His tragedy all at symbolisms of rape, murder and incest. Augment the RSD is expansion of it. That same idea goes for Frank Miller's. The dark knight returns, the new orange tail of a geriatric Batman coming out of retirement. Miller drew on what was then 48 years of Batman stories from Bob Kane to Dennis O'neil from sixties camp to seventies, brooding.

Speaker 1:          01:10          All of it informs the Dark Knight returns introspective depiction of a beast at war with the man who embodies them, both stories, drug depth from the narrative universes to which they belong, more depth in either could achieve alone, and the stories that came after use these in the same way. This is a unique feature of mythology. Every story lends special weight to every other. Shared characters develop a life's worth of pain, triumph, anxiety, affection, and as the tapper street grows, larger and tighter, individual threads become more sensitive to effects on others and the whole. It's why we keep returning to Greek myth. It's why we love comic books and when it comes to film, Marvel comics understands with ironman the incredible hulk captain America, the first Avenger and thor marvel rolled out and incredible and incredibly successful campaign to entwine it's heroes world. The first phase, as they called it, featured origin stories.

Speaker 1:          02:06          Unnecessary hurdle. Average filmgoers weren't familiar with thor or ironman. Then with the groundwork laid in a number of hints that something bigger was on the way marvel studios delivered the avengers, the first shared universe comic film. It's hard to overstate the impact of this under the guidance of Sweden. The avengers came off beautifully, but the real payoff was next with iron man, three marvel released a film in which the facts of a shared universe fed back and added special way to Tony Stark's, new life and story. It's something more than sql. It's something that's never been done before and Phil compared to this DC comics heroes are hopelessly alone. They exist awkwardly on separate film islands. Superman doesn't know Batman, Greenland, or does it. No wonder woman or Martian manhunter or Aquaman. Nobody knows the flash. Christopher Nolan did a superb job with Batman begins and the dark night, but he's got them.

Speaker 1:          03:02          City has no sister in metropolis. Every hero is the first of its kind. Hopefully the upcoming superman versus Batman movie is assigned that DC starting to get its act together. Of course, Dave Cast Ben Affleck, but that's another story. There were even rumors that a Justice League movie, the superior analog of the avengers, in my opinion, is in the cars for 2017 fingers and toes crossed. Who knows what phase marvel will be in. By then, the stories can only get deeper and more complex. It's a big production to fold directors and actors and writers into a shared universe, but it's worth all that trouble if the product is a whole new class of cinema. Hey everybody. Thanks for watching. I'm a huge comic Book Fan and Comic Book Movie Fan. You might know that from some previous videos on the DC person. I've always read DC comics. Superman has been my favorite superhero forever, so it's so painful to watch what DC is doing in their film universe, especially giving Zack Snyder the reigns to superman and Batman and it just, it it. It pains me a lot. If you have an idea for a topic you'd like me to cover a write in the comments and also I love your comments. Keep commenting. I'm. I'm going to try to respond to as many as I can. Hopefully I can do all of them. Thanks for watching and I'll see you next time.
