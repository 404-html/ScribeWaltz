Speaker 1:          00:01          I'm not really a big fan of John luchador anymore. I think. I'm not trying to be disrespectful. I just think I've outgrown him because I was so influential to me that the beginning of my aesthetic, it's a director of like wanting to be a director. He's kind of like lack of complete any type of film style. Just this wanting to make movies for love of it is the one who taught me the fun and the freedom and the joy of of breaking rules just fucking around with the entire medium.

Speaker 2:          00:35          Like many other things in our modern world. The course of film history was changed forever by the Second World War that despite having grown out of him, Quentin Tarantino's self-conscious postmodern aesthetic is a direct descendant of the self conscious postmodern work of John Luca Dart and the French new wave of which Godard is a pioneer, emerges and is a response to the circumstances arising out of the end of World War Two. Let me explain. A year after the end of the war, after the liberation of France from Nazi control, French Prime Minister Leon blue traveled to Washington DC to meet with Secretary of state, James Burns can negotiate an agreement that would cancel Francis $2,000,000,000 ward. They're the result of the bloom burns agreement was the almost complete opening of French markets to American cultural products, particularly films before this agreement, France had imposed quotas on the number of American films allowed to play in French theaters as a way to preserve the unique identity of French cinema.

Speaker 2:          01:41          The Bloomberg's agreement decimated those quarters, resulting in the free market domination of American Hollywood movies in France into this universe. The founding members of the French new wave grew up in the pages of Du Cinema. They advanced a new form of film theory criticizing many of their French forefathers and praising the work of Hollywood studio directors like Alfred Hitchcock, Orson Welles and John finished that job awash in hundreds of Hollywood movies and in depth analysis of American art tourers Gianluca Dart makes breathless from a story treatment by new wave compatriots, Francois Truffaut and Claude chabrol. Breathless is an extended investigation of a French filmmaker identity in the shadow of Hollywood dominance of indeed whether an identity informed by another nation's culture can exist at all. Breathless tells the story of small time Crook, Michelle in the aftermath of his murder of a police officer on his way to see his American lover, Patricia in Paris.

Speaker 2:          02:44          Michel models his personality on Humphrey Bogart just as the film models itself on the Hollywood crime thriller, but in both cases, these identifications are continually frustrated. For example, take a look at the films inciting incident. The film opens with Michelle dressed like a parody of an American gangster mimicking a gesture attributed to folk art. He then steals and American oldsmobile from an American military officer, which almost immediately furnishes him with an implement to make his identity complete. A revolver. After running a light, Michelle is chased by two motorcycle cops. One eventually tracks him down and a shootout and sues the classic dramatic moment of the film, the war, but look at the sequence of shots in which this shootout I'm full.

Speaker 2:          03:44          The whole scene plays like a misfire of these kinds of moments. Not only does a murderer seemed totally unmotivated for the crime committed, but we don't even get to see the cops face. The shootout takes place over only five shots in 10 seconds with imagery and sound effects out of sync, and the camera impulsively favors extreme closeups that obscure the action instead of wide shots that would have made everything clear. Everything in the sequence serves to rob me, shell of his part in the confrontation. The film itself intervenes to strip the scene down to bare formulaic elements. In this way, the film is always watching over Michelle, making comments on his immature desire to become bogart or actually interjecting itself to upset that desire. Later, Michelle confronts a poster of his hero, a giant image of Bogart from his very last movie. The harder they fall, you can see Michelle's Pale reflection being dwarfed by his hero, and then you have a face off between the two men, both totally stone faced and unreadable seconds later, the film loudly announces itself by ending the scene with a wacky, awkward, outmoded Iris.

Speaker 2:          04:55          What's being called to attention here? Well, I think the late film critic Dennis Turner gives us a hint when he cites the French psychoanalyst, Jacques Lacan seat, Louis Kahn's. Most famous contribution to our understanding of human development is something called the mirror stage. It describes the moment when a baby first sees itself in the mirror is that little girl, you too young to have any control yet over itself. The infant recognizes a unity in its mirror version and aspires to that unity projecting itself into the place of the other. This means that the very formation of ourselves, the first time we perceive ourselves as a subject, what we perceive is not really us. It's an imaginary projection of us. For this reason, the human subjects says Lacan is always divided. It's never really hold. Michelle is someone consumed by his identification looking at bogart. He doesn't recognize the impossibility of his hero. He just stares intently forward and it's left to the film and it's anachronistic, fade out to inform us that it knows better. Michelle's immaturity is matched by his love interests, Patricia, that long famous scene that sits at the heart of this movie with Michelle. Hold up in Patricia's bedroom is proceeded by a long look in the mirror by Patricia and it features mirrors all the way through and images of lovers and other men and women. Both characters are lost in search of a solid identity that might be reflected in the other. There are back and forth is a constant oblique, probing into the other, hoping to mind some reaction, some statement that might explain finally

Speaker 3:          06:43          who they are.

Speaker 2:          06:49          At the end of the film, Michelle finally gets everything he needs to escape, but after Patricia betrays him to the police, his imaginary identification with Bogart is finally broke. The tragedy is that the film still forces him along the tracks of the genre inside which he's trapped. The cops bumbling like silly parodies of themselves all throughout the film still nonetheless gunned him down breathless like it's hero oscillates. Between these two registers, it wants to participate in the Hollywood filmmaking it admires, but it knows that such an identification is impossible. So it deals with this by being self conscious, by using jump cuts, awkward transitions, by robbing the classic moments of their force or making the heroes bloody final steps way longer than it could ever possibly be forcing you outside of the films, text or back into it. Again, depending on how you look at it, it's no surprise that the effects of war are fast and unexpected. America flooded France with its films, onto which the new wave filmmakers projected a superiority that they created by then identifying with it in their movies. In other words, American economic dominance created an ideological dominance in the minds of dominated for the only way to deal with this was to be conscious of the dynamic unfixed nature of these identities. Indeed, it's the only way that we can deal with the dynamic unfixed nature of our own identities. The unexpected thing is how influential that consciousness was

Speaker 4:          08:38          Hey everybody, buddy,

Speaker 3:          08:39          thanks for watching. The first set of nerd writer stickers have been sent out in the mail. So you got some of those on Patriot and check for that. Also, there are a lot more sicker than I thought, so I'm going to put up 60 more sets of those stickers on my patrion page, which you can claim by clicking right here, pledging $3 per video, and you get two stickers. You've already got the reward I'd asked you to keep pledging just because you know, that's what makes this channel possible. My patriotic, you know, these videos take like 50 hours to make. So it is a full time job, you know, legitimately, and I hope you guys see that reflected in the quality of the content. Um, so thank you guys so much again and I will see you all next Wednesday.
