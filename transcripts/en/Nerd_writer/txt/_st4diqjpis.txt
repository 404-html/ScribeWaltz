Speaker 1:          00:03          I've never been much of a fan of music videos and I think that's because I sort of just like my music as music. I like to close my eyes and focus on what's happening sonically because that's what music is. It's something that you hear, so that means I can be totally engrossed and in love with beyonce, his latest album, and not care at all about the dozen videos that came out with it, but I don't know. Maybe I'm in the minority here and the truth is that despite music being an oral medium, it's long had an intimate relationship with the visual, so I want to talk about perhaps the most iconic visual supplement in the history of music, but before we talk about that, what about album covers in general these days we perceive them as a kind of visual statement, like the album title or the song names that help us situate the tone or the feeling of what we're going to hear.

Speaker 1:          00:59          It granted that it stays within the dimension of a square. The options and styles are basically limitless, but in the beginning, records packaging was surely utilitarian. The early 78 RPM gramophone records were mostly outfitted with Brown paper or cardboard sleeves to protect the recording. It wasn't until 1938 when Columbia records hired Alex. stine Weiss as its very first art director that the idea of cover art came into existence against the plane or traditional design of early covers. Stein Weiss's original eyecatching art initiated just a huge boom in sales and the market followed as it always does when something works. Record stores were refigured so that instead of just seeing the bindings like books on a shelf, consumers were encouraged to flip through the covers. This all points to just how important the cover art was to the marketing of the product. And music is a product.

Speaker 1:          01:57          It's a commodity that people consume and since you can't buy the band itself, and since the music has no spacial dimension, the album cover emerged as the standard for the commodity to be purchased. This explains the rise of photography on album covers and what's called the personality cover. You know, one of those covers where it's just a photograph of the band or musician, still pretty popular today. A perfect example of this personality cover can be seen on the Beatles first album. Please, please meet. Look at those bright smiling faces staring warmly into the camera lens. As Susan Sontag once brilliantly said in its simplest form, we have in a photograph surrogate possession of a cherished person or thing. As their career advanced, the Beatles seemed to become darkly aware of their status as commodities, perhaps nowhere more plainly acknowledged that on the cover of their fourth album, aptly titled Beatles for sale, featuring another of the personality cover this time without the warmth and the smiles.

Speaker 1:          03:03          By the time sergeant pepper's emerge, the Beatles had already begun challenging the conventions with popular music and its role in culture, and this extended to the album covers too. First in rubber soul with it's distorted image and funky tight face. Then with revolver for which they employed their friend and artists, Klaus Vorman, we did a kind of 19 sixties update of Victorian illustrator Aubrey beardsley famous black ink drawings. In other words, the Beatles were leaders in expanding and album covers function from a marketing tool to a work of art in its own right, and that brings us back to what is really the holy grail of album covers, the Beatles' sergeant pepper's lonely hearts club band, a cover that explicitly engages the audience in so many ways and critiques and interpretations and comparisons and contrasts. It's a cover that invites you in and a perfect example of this is the immediate challenge to just identify who all of these people are.

Speaker 1:          04:06          What do Indian Gurus, Karl Marx and Bob Dylan all have in common? The sergeant pepper's cover once you to ask questions like this. Now, in one sense, of course, these people just represent the Beatles interests and influences, many of whom didn't make the final cut, and yet by juxtaposing high brow artists and thinkers like marks or Aubrey Beardsley or George Bernard Shaw or Dylan Thomas with pop icons like Bob Dylan, Marilyn Monro, Marlin Brando, and Shirley temple. The Beatles signaled the breakdown and mixing of high and low culture that they themselves exemplified more than any other artist with sergeant pepper. The Beatles were in a posture of challenge, challenging everything they'd been up to that point, challenging the highbrow art critics to abandon their exclusion of popular culture, challenging the listening public to engage with something other than love songs, and the same for courts there were even challenging the feelings of unity that defined the summer of love in 1967, delivering a suite of songs that featured alienation and loss as much as it did love and togetherness. The album cover echoes these challenges and adds some of its own by using the technique of photo montage, which manipulates photography's unique ability to depict reality. The Beatles blend and collapsed the values of a number of different times and places by staging the scene as a performance and an audience. The band challenges us to do,

Speaker 2:          05:39          dwell on the function both indeed. These considerations were at the front of their minds as the Beatles had only recently elected to stop performing live. After the mayhem, a beatle mania began to diminish the quality of music while some accused them of leaving their fans.

Speaker 1:          05:55          Hi. The sergeant pepper's cover suggests the opposite, that the decision to stop touring was out of respect for their fans, not out of fear or contempt. We should also note that the designer of discover, Peter Blake was a noted pop artists, a style that used aspects of mass culture to bring attention to the fuzzy lines between art, advertising, news, and all other forms of media. The pop artists wanted to get people to think about the process and manufacturing of ar and how it's categorizations and hierarchies are largely arbitrary. Blake and the Beatles design the sergeant pepper cover as both a piece of art and a product inside it's gatefold sleeve. The record had paper cutouts of the pepper bans regalia adding to its consumer kitsch value, and yet it was also the first album to display the lyrics on the packaging, encouraging listeners to interrogate the records, intellectual content as well.

Speaker 1:          06:53          The truth is, of course that music perhaps more prominently than any other art form, plays both parts as a commodity and an aesthetic object, and in many ways the two functions are inseparable. The Beatles knew this and maybe they regretted it, but they were self aware enough to see that it was inescapable and if music had to be marketed and if the visual was going to be the vehicle of that John, Paul, George, and Ringo were going to be as playful here they were with everything else. In the end, this photograph of photographs levels a critique on representation itself to show how music is mediated by the visual. The Beatles put themselves on this cover three times once as the wax figures of the mop top beetles that they were once as the fake pepper band and it's bright and eye catching glory and finally as themselves pictured not on the cover of their album, but by the effects of that cover in the minds of everyone who looked at the real Beatles can't be represented this way.

Speaker 1:          07:58          Not really not like this or like this or like this. The cover of sergeant pepper's lonely hearts club band points to the truth. What the Beatles themselves knew that all music is invisible then in the news today. Hey everybody, thanks for watching.
