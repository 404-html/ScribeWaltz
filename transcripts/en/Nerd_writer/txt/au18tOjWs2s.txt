Speaker 1:          00:02          Proliferation of nuclear weapons is a detestable artifact of human beings, seemingly ineradicable desire to dominate other human beings. Nuclear weapons, perhaps more than any other manmade thing, represent that uneasy dichotomy between the brilliant scientific creativity of a technological achievement and the consequences of its function, its attention that's been explored by so many thinkers and moralists even by some of the scientists who work themselves on the famous or infamous Manhattan.

Speaker 2:          00:36          The only reaction I remember perhaps I was blinded by my own reaction, was very considerable elation and excitement and I was going to parties and people got drunk and it would make a tremendous interesting contrast what was going on in Los Alamos at the same time as what was going on in Hiroshima.

Speaker 1:          01:02          Nuclear weapons have been tested over 2000 times since little boy and fat men were dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima for tests and demonstrations for civil engineering purposes, moving land, creating artificial bays, things like that. There was even an extended US military operation called operation. Plowshare started in 1958 at the height of the atomic age, which aim to exploit the quote, friendly Adam. Plowshare saw the explosion of 35 nuclear bombs until public outcry shut the program down in 1975. The nuclear industry wanted to desensitize the public to the negative connotations associated with nuclear weapons, but the problem was that those negative connotations were present in every step of the program. Project GNOME vented radioactive steam over the very press gallery that was called to confirm it safety. The next blast, 104 kiloton detonation at UCO. Flat Nevada displays 12 million tons of soil and resulted in a radioactive dust cloud that rose 12,000 feet and plume toward the Mississippi River.

Speaker 1:          02:11          You can read all about operation plow share in the Department of Energy's executive summary of the program, which I'll put in the description below. Even now, they seem to talk about it with a kind of what could have been disappointed. Plowshare and the hundreds of other nuclear tests that have been done since its termination deal in the super violent production of fundamental particles that have a real, almost unbelievable impact on environmental makeup. Indeed, the creation of new chemical elements like Einsteinian from and were the result of the first thermo nuclear explosion code named Ivy Mike in Nineteen 52 nuclear blast create so much change in the environment that their fingerprint can be felt in fields. On the opposite end of the academic spectrum, in 2008 occurred to Russian avant garde painting expert Alaina Baster, then curator of the Russian museum in St Petersburg inundated with a booming forgery market that have scientists chemically tested the paint in suspicious canvases.

Speaker 1:          03:12          They might find something in its makeup which dated the pieces more accurately than other methods using a mass spectrometer basner and some artistically minded scientists were able to see that to isotope caesium 1:37 and strontium 90 appeared in greater concentration in canvases from after 1945 when the first nuclear weapons were detonated. These radioactive vision products are ejected from nuclear blast into the atmosphere and absorbed into earth, soil, and then Earth's plant life, namely flax plants from which we get flaxseed oil or linseed oil, a major bonding agent and oil paints. This fills me with such an odd feeling. Almost all post 1945 oil paintings contain a fingerprint of nuclear weapons. Remember that next time you go to your local gallery or if ever you lose faith in the ironic interconnectedness of all things that within our most refined creative impulse lurks traces of are equally refined, exact opposite impulse for destruction.

Speaker 1:          04:27          Hey everybody, thanks for watching. There are so many tangents I could have gone down with this video and I want it to. I just didn't want to make it too long, but I put a lot of the links and sources in the description under works cited so you can read for yourself some of the cool stuff about operation cloudshare about nuclear weapons, fishing products, art forgeries. There's just a lot of cool things. Thank you to everybody who followed me on Tumbler and used the ask me anything feature to have some discussions about some cool stuff about this video, but other videos I encourage you to keep doing that. Tumbler is really cool for, for doing sort of longer discussions about things and I'll see you next week.
