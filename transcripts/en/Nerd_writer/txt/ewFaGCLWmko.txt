Speaker 1:          00:00          Oh, coffee on a Tuesday in 19

Speaker 1:          00:18          the pole j Getty Museum in Los Angeles is beautiful, not only for the breathtaking artifacts and it's large collection, but for the palatial architecture and for the experience of going there to the top of that mountain and a trolley car above the city from some of its balconies. You can see the entirety of greater Los Angeles sat beneath its film, move, smug, and you can see the ocean and the West. It's gardens or tranquil. You can sit on the grass and enjoy the day and then it's back down the trolley and you feel educated, cultured better for the experience. The next morning over coffee and you read in the paper that archeological sites in Iraq have been ravaged by looters who have sunk holes into the dirt and rip thousands of year old artifacts from the ground to sell them on the market for cat still fresh from your trip to the getty.

Speaker 1:          01:00          Your newfound sense of culture is outraged by such disregard for history and you begin to think of those artifacts you saw yesterday in the museum as the luckiest orphans in the world. Thank God for museums. You say, thank God for the getty. Here's the essential problem of the antiquities market. On the one side you have leaders who everybody hates, and on the other side you have museums which everybody loves. It's hard to see at first glance that these two things are unavoidably connected. See looters, Luke, because there's money in it. These are poor people and they need to feed their families. Okay, so let's say that it circulates around the village, that there is a man entailed, willing to pay good money for Sumerian cylinder, seals from the Babylonian era, and the guy next door knows exactly where to find them. Well, our would be luder travels with his neighbor in the middle of the night to the chosen archaeological site and sinks holes into the ground looking for Sumerian cylinder seals.

Speaker 1:          01:46          He doesn't find anything for awhile. Eventually he comes upon a pocket of them. Now his shovel has smashed five beyond all recognition, but two are still intact even in good condition, and this will feed his family for a month. So he goes to town and seeks the buyer out. Now he pays a little bit less than was reported, but beggars can't be choosers and this is his first time. Now the buyer is excited because these cylinder seals are very hot right now among private collectors and he expects a good turnover from here. The cylinder seals run a complicated route of buyers and sellers and smugglers and dealers across oceans and international borders. Maybe staying awhile in the Geneva freeport where storage items are exempt from customs regulations, you know, just to keep a low profile. It's an almost impossible route to follow. An antiquities dealers are very good at confusing the authorities who mostly stay five steps behind and out of jurisdiction.

Speaker 1:          02:35          Eventually, those very, very old Sumerian cylinder seals will end up in one of two places. Private collections or museum. Why? Well, because like I said, those seals are very hot right now and in an estimated $4,000,000,000 a year. Industry hot is really. Yes, the dealer is fooled the authorities, but it's small potatoes. When you consider how much they fooled us, see the whole thing can be boiled down to a simple business model. Supply and demand without demand. There is no supply and so museums like the getty in Los Angeles where the met in New York City or the MFA in Boston can go on demanding elicit artifacts because most people don't realize that this causes this. It's why when people like Philippe de Montebello, the former director of the met say things like, we're lucky, allergist abandoned the shivering orphan child on a cold, rainy day in the street. Defense, defensive their practices, we can call a big bullshit.

Speaker 1:          03:22          These people are the parents orphaning their children off the metaphor. It isn't really. It was Montebello in 2006 who had to return the fame Euphronios Krater to Italy after it was shown to have had been clearly alluded from a tomb and secretary. He later said, how much more could you learn from knowing which particular hole that came out of? Well, this just shows you how ignorant these people really are. As the answer to his question is, of course, virtually every. There's an archeological term called provenience. It means the location of an object in three dimensional space in relation to all the things around it. Another word would be context and objects for tells us 99 percent of the information about its significance and use. It's why archeologists use all those little tools to dig things up to preserve the provenience. Okay, so an example. If a Roman coin was found by a snorkelers off the coast of Alexandria and sold to museum, the experts there could probably tell you a lot about what year it was made and what meant it came from even in.

Speaker 1:          04:15          That's a nice amount of superficial information. Let's say the circle or didn't touch the coin and instead reported the fine will archeologists searching the area, then find many more coins and not only can they tell you about the year that it was made in the mint that it came from, but they can start to tell you a new story about the shipping trade in the Roman era. Mediterranean Sea context is everything. The aim of archeology is to tell the most true, most comprehensive story about the past, under the assumption that both the past and the truth are worth something to. In 2007, the getty returned 40 artifacts to Italy under mounting pressure from international authorities. Now they did it quietly and without admitting wrongdoing, but these repatriations are becoming more to stop the supply. You have to choke the demand and to do that you have to educate people about how the antiquities market really works.

Speaker 1:          04:58          You have to show them how they are being fooled by palatial architecture and great presentation. You have to say to them that though these places are undeniably beautiful, sitting as they do on the top of mountains above the city, that there are cultures being destroyed and forgotten every day and they had their own ideas about architecture and presentation in beauty. Don't you think that their ideas in our culture has a right to be remembered correctly? High nerd writer here, this is my friend Sam. He just finished making a World War II short, epic called the American starring made. You want to check it out and I suggest that you do it because it is pretty fucking awesome. You can find that link in the doodly. Do anything to add Sam.
