Speaker 1:          00:01          Coffee on a Tuesday and blog 26. I'm back, baby.

Speaker 1:          00:16          In the spring of 18, 18, the poet John Keats wrote a letter to his friend John Hamilton Reynolds, which contained in it a poetic metaphor for how he saw human life. He called it the mansion of many apartments and the image goes sort of like this. The first department we step into, he calls the thoughtless chamber here. We remain for as long as we do not think now, I think keats means by this thinking deeply, philosophically, poetically, et Cetera, and the whole time we're in this chamber, this apartment, the door to the next department is wide open, showing a bright appearance on the other side. Now at first, maybe we have no motivation to move toward it, but slowly, eventually the thinking principle impels us to and we go in. Now, once we get inside into the second chamber, which keeps calls, the Chamber of maiden thought we become intoxicated by the light and atmosphere.

Speaker 1:          01:14          We see nothing but pleasant wonders and think of the laying there forever in delight. In other words, we get a taste of the ideal. Then the mood changes, one of the effects of sharpening one's mind and the Chamber of maiden thought is that one begins to see deeper into the heart of man, into the misery, pain, sickness and depression, that the world is full of. These things gradually begin to darken the chamber, fill it with the fog, but at the same time that it gets dark on all sides of the room, doors are set open leading away to dark passages, which it then becomes one's choice to take or not take. You can see that even in a letter, keats's powers of description are extraordinary. He later coined the term negative capability, a concept to describe an artist who understanding the inherent mysteries of life could find the strength to remain to be in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts without any irritable reaching after fact and reason.

Speaker 1:          02:15          He cited Shakespeare as a key example of an artist who had achieved this in 1890 a year. After the letter to John Reynolds, keats writes his own to a nightingale, one of his best works. Indeed, one of the best works of poetry, in my opinion, eight stands as long the poem tells of the narrators reaction to hearing the song of a nightingale to bird being representative of the ideal and his profound longing to join it even at the expense of his life. The poem starts with the narrator becoming paralyzed by the bird song, which commences a journey through the layers of his soul. Now, in a minute, I'm just going to put a link up here probably right here to another video where all recite the poem for you because poems like this should be heard. And in the corner somewhere in one of these corners, I'm going to put numbers corresponding to the stanza so that you'll have a sign posts, um, as, as we go along, try to keep in mind the metaphor of the management of many apartments and the concept of negative capability. While I'm reading it. Also, it might be worthwhile to say that the general rule with art is that you could have any feeling about it that you damn well please, but whatever you like, whatever you know you fancy in terms of art, it's good to memorize poems I highly recommended, and if you want to memorize one of your favorite poems and recite it and posted as a rated video response, I will most certainly put it up on the video so

Speaker 2:          03:46          the link should be there. Now, maybe here, I don't know. Clicked. Click on it. Oh, to a nightingale like John Keats. Click here, right here, right here. My face is now the lake. It's a good poem. I promise. You have to believe me. You have to believe me. Please. Believe me. You
