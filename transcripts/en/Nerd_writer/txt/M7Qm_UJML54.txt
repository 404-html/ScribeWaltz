Speaker 1:          00:02          First Grade, Scifi cover artist was frank or Paul discovered by the father of science fiction publisher Hugo Gernsback. In 1914, Paul define the imagery that came to be associated with Scifi tails is covers, have amazing stories. The first magazine devoted solely to this new genre, features, spectacular spaceships and spacemen, giant insects, laser guns, and a lot of really odd looking aliens in those years. The middle 19 twenties. These covers were probably among the strangest art that the average American ever got to see on news stands, these colorful garish nightmare visions and leaped into the imaginations of young readers. Paul is such a towering figure in science fiction because so many influential writers and artists in the field, not to mention readers, can trace their obsession with the genre to the unforgettable experience of seeing his covers for the first time. The purpose of a book cover, of course, is to draw you in to peak your interest enough to read the story behind it, but on these covers, paul launched a fascinating genre of painting and design that rarely gets the attention it deserves in the same way that science fiction and fantasy as genres historically didn't get the attention that they deserved.

Speaker 1:          01:18          Interestingly, one of the byproducts, I think of this lack of attention was that the cover art for these books got to explore weirder and more avant garde artistic styles than they would have otherwise. The revolution inside Fi covers came with a revolution and book selling. In 1939 Robert to graph launched pocket books, the first mass market publisher of paperbacks in America, and he was hugely successful and amazing as it sounds. No one really thought that people would read paperbacks, but when the pocket version of James Hilton's last horizon sold two and a half million copies, people knew that there was a change in the air as marked are noted in the daily beast. Suddenly the four point three by seven inch format of mass market paperbacks became the canvas for cover artists and with more scifi selling and with the genre getting more of it. Stu, culturally, publishers look to artists who could reflect the deep themes that the story's explored.

Speaker 1:          02:14          Take Penguin the British bookseller in the forties and fifties. They were known for their classic orange and white covers then in the sixties, in an effort to raise the sophistication of their science fiction offering. Art Director Germano facility started pairing novels with covers featuring the work of popular modern artists. For example, James publishes a case of conscience takes place on the planet with organic almost biological shape. Buildings for the cover for steady chose a detail from data estin, surrealist painter, Max Ernst, the eye of silence, or Jg Ballard, the drowned world of post apocalyptic novel set in Oblique, flooded uninhabitable London for this, for Seti, chose Eve 10 surreal landscape of battered shapes and odd configurations called the Palace of windowed rocks. After for Seti, a series of art directors through the sixties and seventies commissioned original works or did it themselves. There was Allen Aldridge who created a series of beautiful psychedelic images over black in the late 19 sixties.

Speaker 1:          03:13          There was Franco Greg [inaudible], who pioneered methods of experimental photography resulting in a monochromatic kaleidoscopic images in 1970. Then there was David Pelham who made this iconic cover for a clockwork orange in 1972 and these gorgeous reprints of the Ballard classics a few years later over at ballantine books. It was Richard powers who is really pushing the limits of the form. The ballantine's essentially gained powers, free reign to pull from all his modernists and surrealist influences, sometimes pulling completely away from the actual content of the book. The result was hundreds of covers that could have easily filled gallery spaces and modern art museums, and while they were increasingly abstract powers, covers mind the subconscious in the surreal, in the same way that the best science fiction does the present a world that's warped often in radical ways as a reaction to the world. That is one of the things I love about Scifi cover art is how accessible it is, like literally accessible.

Speaker 1:          04:15          You can walk into any used bookstore anywhere and get five of these old pulp books for a dollar each. I can own a vincent defeat and a Bob Pepper and Ian Miller's insane cover for Bradbury's long after midnight, and then the art is with you. It's in your home. As you read the stories, it's on your bedside table. It's art you hold with your hands. It's not precious. It's been folded and creased and above all, it's weird. Scifi and fantasy covers had the chance to be weird, not only because of the weird things going on in the stories, but because the genre was categorized as pope and weird imagery sort of came with the territory. There are hundreds of artists and thousands upon thousands of books in this tradition. I can't possibly cover it all here, partly because a good amount of it is forgotten. Hiding away in crates at the back of bookstores. Next time you're at one, pull some of those crates out and see if you can't find a last chapter in this eclectic and underappreciated sub genre of art history.
