Speaker 1:          00:00          I didn't know what they, I'm trying to get him to rap show. Oh, new one. Oh my mind just wanders. Gentleman. Let me give this phone to get around this problem.

Speaker 2:          00:24          So this is day three of hurricane. No hurricane sandy aftermath. I am up in a hotel in midtown Manhattan. My employers and Msnbc were nice enough to put me up, um, for. I been staying in my friends up in a, uh, upper west side. Great friends, great employer. I haven't been back to my place in like three days. I'm back down in lower east side, which is, you know, completely without power. It's a strange situation right now because it's like half the city is dark half the sit down right now in lower Manhattan. It is like Mad Max, wild west style, you know, people in dumpsters trying to get food, crowding around surge protectors to charge their cell phones. It's crazy. Obviously the power being out is not as bad as the way some people have a right now, which is, you know, I'm talking about the Jersey shore where there's just scenes of devastation. Houses are torn up, people have unfortunately passed away in the storm. It's, it's, it's terrible. So you really can't complain even for what, you know, they have to go go through down there, but it's still a very strange and surreal sight, uh, being, um, being in the city and how being in a, in a, in a really, what is an island divided
