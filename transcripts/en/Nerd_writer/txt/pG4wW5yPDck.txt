Speaker 1:          00:00          It is 57 degrees in New York City in January, coffee on a Tuesday and blog, 46 in the deep reaches of our universe and starless spaces as here in New York City. Time passes without impediment like a ball rolling smoothly downhill forever. We are, as humans drawn to extrapolate it forward and backward to the coffee we're meant to get with a friend later this afternoon to the siege of Constantinople in 12. Oh, four. To our illustrious future of flying cars or to the time when you tried to teach her sister to cal when she was three

Speaker 2:          00:47          out loud.

Speaker 1:          00:49          Our meditations take us far before and far beyond the present moment so far. We feel the gaps like giant, deep breaths in our hearts. But was there a time when time was. What I mean to say is, did time ever begin? Let's start with the Wilkinson microwave and a Satrapi probe. Board w map a measuring device launched far into the solar system in 2001 to take spherical images of the universe at several different frequencies. We've observed the first light emitted in our universe. Some 380,000 years after the big bang. It's called the cosmic microwave background. Though we can't see before that we can extrapolate using the speed of the expanding galaxy backwards to determine that the big bang happened around 13 point 7 billion years ago. We can, however, get to the moment of the Big Bang, we can only probe with our physics two right after to a second, after to a millisecond after to one unit of plank time, roughly 10 to the negative 43 seconds after the big bang.

Speaker 1:          01:49          Many of our brightest believed that the moment we can't see the moment of the big bang is in fact a singularity and infinitely hot and infinitely dense point, which when released, created space and time. Others disagree saying that our universe is merely one in a series or part of an infinite loop of expansion and contraction, but are we any closer to conceiving of an answer to our question? As the oed defines it, time as the indefinite continued progress of events in scientific terms, it's the perpetual transition from low entropy to high entropy from a ordered state to a confused one. You can crack an egg, but you cannot uncrack it. You can remember the past, but not the future. The truth is that the only reason we know time is there is because we perceive it. We don't see it. We see simply causes and effects and conclude its presence as St Augustine said, what then is time?

Speaker 1:          02:40          If no one asks me, I know what it is. If I wished to explain it to him who asks, I do not know. So where are we? Just confused. Mouthpieces asking absurd questions like, when did time begin? The question won't even allow itself to be asked. Why? Why is it unreachable? Well, maybe there's an answer in the beginning. The Big Bang. The singularity is essentially a discontinuity, a break in our understanding there wasn't, and then there was the concept of emergent phenomena is extremely important. It's something that arises as the effect of complex causes, but is not analyzable simply as the sum of their effects. A great example of emergent phenomena is Darwinian evolution. The formula that is natural selection can be arrived at simply by studying the laws of physics. Indeed before Darwin. That's what every biologist tried to do. It was Darwin's genius to see that the rule of evolution emerged from the rule of physics, which is to say, given the initial conditions of the universe, one could not predict the emergence and rule of Darwinian evolution on earth.

Speaker 1:          03:43          There is a discontinuity between the two sets of rules in the same way. There's a discontinuity between matter and light from the particles of matter emerge, the organizing principle of life compatible with matter, but not analyzable as the sum of its effects, and here is where time comes back into the picture. Matter by its very definition is a function of space. It can move through time, but taking generally is not effected by with the emergence of life space and time, converged life is the evolving complexity of an organism in every stage of its evolution corresponds with a moment in time and vice versa. Now, there's one more emergent phenomena in this sequence and it's the most important to both us and our discussion here. The emergence of the mind. As life came from matter, the mind came from life, from the increasing complexity and growth of the brain coupled with of all things the vocal cords.

Speaker 1:          04:36          It was at the dawn of language probably sometime in the last hundred thousand years when the dual emergence of symbols and the mind changed everything again, the use of language to make symbols which are just names that change in different context allowed for the creation of a symbolic reality. In other words, everything you see around you, the rule of symbolic reality is again, compatible with life but not analyzable as the sum of its effects. It's something new. Our minds are something new, whereas matter is a function of space and life is a function of both space and time. Our minds, the human mind is purely a function of time. Think about it. What is the one evident quality of thoughts that they have to happen in sequence? The only way we can tell one idea from another is by identifying the order in which they occur. This is why it's hard actually impossible for us to fully wrap our minds around time or to consider a state in which it doesn't exist. You can't use a ruler to measure the absence of space in a very real way. What we consider to be ourselves is composed of time stuff, and it is given to us of all creatures to consider, measure, conserve, and extrapolate it as we wish. We are each of us time superheroes.

Speaker 1:          05:57          Wow.
