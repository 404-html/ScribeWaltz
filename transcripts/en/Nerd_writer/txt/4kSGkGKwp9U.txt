Speaker 1:          00:02          Much like game of thrones before it, Hbo Westworld is an elaborate at big puzzle box of a production that serves in the end as an excuse to explore something much smaller and much more important character. This is why despite the sweeping vistas what holds everything else up or the conversations, how they're written and how they're acted, and today I want to take a look at one conversation featuring the Great Anthony Hopkins. Specifically, I want to examine how hopkins acts the scene, how he elevates every line of dialogue to a hypnotically interesting level. You'll imagine I've gone mad. You lost my way. Simply concerned about the extent of the changes you're making. You want to protect the legacy. My legacy. Okay. The background of the scene is that Teresa Colon and operations manager of the westworld theme park is trying to stop or at least stall the creation of Robert for Anthony Hopkins, new storyline for the guests. The storyline that is generally wreaking chaos on things to the point of worrying the parks financier's. It's clear that Theresa feels that Ford's undertaking is just too risky, but instead of forthrightly telling him so she puts things in euphemistic terms, you want to protect your legacy

Speaker 2:          01:17          legacy.

Speaker 1:          01:24          Okay, that pause is fully seven seconds long and it is amazing after reacting in disbelief at such a shameless euphemism, hopkins in silence cycles through a few emotions first disbelief than a consideration of the words for a split second at their face value. Maybe he should safeguard his legacy. Maybe he shouldn't be so ambitious at his age. Then a smile and this scene will feature several shades of smile. This one is kind as kind as can be in the face of what he considers to be an attack. One that insults his intelligence as he looks down and chuckles. The smile seems to acquire some suppressed anger. You can only bear to look at her in quick glances as he composes himself. Then he fires back and antagonistic remark. You're done. Like this space that amounts to.

Speaker 1:          02:16          I've seen many of you come and go over the years and I can tell the ones who enjoy the time here, the ones who don't. What's impressive here is how hopkins breaks down the dialogue as written in interviews. Hopkins has described how he reads scripts 200 times or so to the point where the dialogue is lodged in his brain that he steps away. Let's sit, gestate in his mind, and when he arrives on set, he relaxes himself and let the punk days where you by having such a command over the words, hopkins is able to modulate the tempo of their delivery to get the most out of it. This sentence, for example, is spread through. I've seen many of you come and go over the years and as as the first part of the next sentence, until a pause, after who drawing out the word enjoy, which falls right back into a speedy delivery, almost slipping over the words until the final two, which coupled with icontact, slowed down to function.

Speaker 1:          03:09          As an accusation. I've seen many of you come and go over the years and I can tell the ones who enjoy the time on pseudo. I admire it, the audacity of it, a small interjection, but see how he opens up like a flower from the hunched position, how he releases a little tension to receive the compliment. Great touch. I came there once as a child with my parents. I think we even sat at this table when I started working here. I realized this place wasn't something I would enjoy and then we get a second interjection. When his suspicions are confirmed, followed by hunching again and at the fleeted neck. Then from this position, Hopkins launches into his key speech. In the beginning, I imagined things would be perfectly balanced. Even the beds with my partner Arnold, to that effect, they made 100 hopeful storylines. Of course, almost no one took us up on the last.

Speaker 1:          04:10          The bad. Arnold always held a somewhat dim view of people. He preferred the hosts. They begged me not to let you people in the money, man, tell us, okay, we're about to learn that this whole meeting is a threat setup by Hopkins and to signal that Hopkins incrementally dials up the menace across three terms that specify who he threatening you people, money, men delos, listen to it again. They begged me not to let you people in the money, men Delis, but I told him, if you find that you didn't understand what you are paying for, it's not a business venture. Now seem an entire world designed every inch of it,

Speaker 3:          04:59          every blade of grass in here. We have a God's Mandy August.

Speaker 1:          05:11          Watching this, the first time it was here that it struck me how crucial Ford's personality is to the functioning of the series. I mean, westworld is in many ways a ridiculous idea both as a theme park and as a TV show to work. The conceit had to be mapped, reflected, justified in the complex desires and ambitions of its creators. The writers have achieved that in Fort, but it's hopkins who really brings these things to light and how did that work? For sadly, he lost his perspective. He went mad. I haven't, as you well know, I've always seen things very clearly the threat now, explicit hopkins colors the rest of the scene with a sinister glean. This is the table I sat with my parents. They know everything about our guests. Don't pay as we know everything about our employees. From here on out, he presses his advantage not with force, but with comfort, with a smile, no longer needing to convince Teresa of his dominance, hopkins dances and different attitudes for a couple of seconds before falling back into that smile like right here where he's.

Speaker 1:          06:25          Matter of fact, we know everything about our guests don't pay as we know everything about our employees or here where he's concerned, I do hope he will be careful with a nod or here where he's genuinely caring as his eyes wander off for a moment too. It has a sensitive disposition. The producers of the show are smart to keep the camera fixed on Hopkins face. His ability learned across many decades to convey such a web of feeling and suggest such a universe of feeling within about a character we know little about expands. The entire shows range and strengthens it's persuasive power as a piece of art. That's what a great actor can do. You can give words and images or a short scene like this of volcanic energy with the quiet look and Anthony Hopkins hands in his eyes. Westworld isn't just a reflection of its creators personality. It's a self portrait. You can tell the board that I needed to be completed on time and it won't be a retrospective as I'm sure you have so sentimental.

Speaker 2:          07:54          How.

Speaker 1:          07:58          Hey everybody, there is a new nerd writer video every Wednesday, so if you click right there, you'll subscribe to this channel and get all the videos. Sorry, I've been so irregular with my posting recently. I've been in Italy. It's been crazy, but also have been writing a couple of speeches for the Singapore Writers Festival, which I'll be at in a couple of weeks. Um, and so that's been taking a lot of my time. I have to shout out a channel that I really love called wisecrack. They do video essays like me, eight, the philosophy, earthlink, cinema, stuff like that. They just did something on bojack horseman, which is a show I love and the video is great too, so I'll link that below. Check that out. Thanks guys for watching. I'll see everybody next Wednesday. Hopefully.
