Speaker 1:          00:24          Rembrandt's

Speaker 2:          00:25          painting, the Nightwatch, perhaps the most famous work of his long career and have the Dutch golden age generally is not set at night and it's not really a watch either. It's a painting of the militia company of district two under the command of captain fronds Bennett, coke, which is also it's true law, original name. Essentially later after years of varnish and low light dark in the canvas, someone called it the night watch and it stuck because, well, that's what it looked like. In fact, the nightwatch was meant to be a daytime scene just like other portraits of the Dutch civic guards, groups of well to do Amsterdam. Citizens tasked with keeping the peace should threats come to the city walls over the 16th and 17th centuries, civic guard portraits became a genre all its own and is painting in the Netherlands, moved away from spiritual subject matter and toward the secular artists.

Speaker 2:          01:20          Welcomed commission work from these wealthy guilds because they wanted large group portraits again and again and again. But if you want to know why. Rembrandt's is the only civic garde painting that makes it into most school curriculums. Oh, you have to do is look at it commissioned to do what all the others had done. Show off the paying members of the guild. Rembrandt takes the genre and explodes his vision through it. The Night Watch is an eruption of action, shadow and light with drama that's more suited to a biblical or historical epic. Not 17 guys from peace time, Amsterdam. No offense to captain coke. So what makes the nightwatch so great? Well, what hits me right away is the balance that rembrandt strikes between chaos and unity. He clearly wanted to create a canvas with a lot of movement, but the challenge was how to make that movement.

Speaker 2:          02:10          People lurching in different directions, performing a variety of actions cohere into a unified whole. The keystone, the part of the painting that holds everything in place or the dual figures of the captain and his lieutenant, the rest of the portrait moves away from them diagonally. Indeed, rembrandt places these lines directly onto the painting in the form of weapons and Poles, and the effect isn't just two dimensional and maybe the most striking thing is the captain and the lieutenant seemed to be emerging from the picture plane, the captain's hand ordering the company forward. It's as if you could grab it and pull them out of the frame. The lieutenants part is in the spirit like weapon he's holding in. His left hand is so expertly foreshorten feels like it could cut you. In fact, based on the angle and the placement of the weapon shadow on the ground, the partisan is beyond the picture plane, or at least it should be.

Speaker 2:          03:04          Another trick rembrandt uses to achieve this effect is one that will be familiar to filmmakers. The figures in the front are painted with detail and clarity. While the further back you go in the composition, the softer and hazier thing seemed to get. Rembrandt is mimicking depth of field and optical phenomenon that can make objects in focus pop from their backgrounds. All of these effects were carefully planned by Rembrandt to anchor the composition around the central figures. The longer you look at the night watch, the more meaning emerges from this burst of frenetic energy. For example, the three men with guns are performing the three main actions associated with the archibus, the primary weapon of this particular guilt loading, firing and blowing clear the gunpowder pen. In fact, these poses match almost perfectly engravings from a book called exercise of arms, a famous manual on how to use weaponry released at the beginning of that century.

Speaker 2:          04:00          This particular civic guard, the Clo veneers is signaled again in the chicken that's hanging from the young girls waste. A similar claw was on the Clo veneers code of arms, and while the captain's hand points toward the viewer, it shadow points toward his companies function. It's cradling the emblem of Amsterdam Elian and three crosses. The clo veneers were supposed to protect the city. The other notable feature is Rembrandt's famous use of Couto, sqirl and effective, deeply contrasted light and shadow. It's a technique that first came to prominence in the work of Caravaggio who used sharp contrasts and harsh lighting to create intense drama in his paintings. The rembrandt was clearly interested in this technique, but for him, light served a somewhat different purpose and not only as remembrance cattle softer than Caravaggio's, but the light in his painting seems to have a numinous quality as if once it touches the subjects, it becomes a part of them.

Speaker 2:          04:56          If we turn back to the nightwatch, we can see that rembrandt uses [inaudible] to single out two key figures, the lieutenant and the girl, as we've already seen, both these figures contained symbols that call back to the group itself. In the case of the lieutenant, it's as if the captain's orders to assemble are illuminating his second in command and from his light. The rest of the company is to fall in line, and yet compositionally the two light had figures almost serve the opposite purpose. Instead of unifying the company, the girl and the lieutenant seem strategically placed to break up the individual men in the canvas flanking the captain. They almost isolate him and thanks to their contrast were drawn to the haphazard actions and faces of each man all seeming to be lost in their own world. The night watches capturing the moments before the company sets out to its collective purpose, but the painting almost makes us doubt that they'll ever get there.

Speaker 2:          05:52          Indeed, by the time this painting was made in 16, Forty two nearing the victorious of the 80 years war with the Spanish, the Dutch were prosperous in civic guards were more ceremonial than necessary. At a certain point, these companies became clubs for men to play with their weapons and chip in for fancy group portraits. It's not inconceivable that Rembrandt may have been secretly making fun of them a little bit in this his most famous painting, but that's the tension that the painter captures in the night. Watch and endless jockeying between light and dark nation and individual chaos and order. Rembrandt could never let either one of those elemental forces went out in his composition because if he did, he lose the most essential thing, the thing he was striving for and achieves within effect that makes this one of the greatest paintings of all time.
