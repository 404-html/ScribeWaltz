Speaker 1:          00:00          But isn't it on America and wrong to discriminate against people based on their religion?

Speaker 2:          00:05          Really the problem.

Speaker 3:          00:10          We have people coming into our country that are looking to do tremendous harm. You look at the t, look at Paris, look at what happened in Paris. I mean these people, they did not come from Sweden. Okay? Look at what happened in Paris. Look at what happened last week in California with with 14 people dead. Other people going to die there so badly injured mean we have a real problem. There's a tremendous hatred out there and what I want to do is find out what you know. You can't solve a problem until you find out what's the root core cars and I want to find out what is the problem, what's going on? And it's temporary. I've had so many people call me and say thank you. Now, if you remember when I did that a week ago, it was like bedlam all of a sudden and you watched last night and you see people talking to say, well, trump has a point. We have to get down to the problem. The people that are friends of mine, they called, they said, Donald, you've done us a tremendous service because we do have a problem and we have to find out those crank calls. Those may have been. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:10          great.

Speaker 1:          01:11          One of the things I find fascinating about Donald Trump is the way he uses language differently than other candidates for political office, especially for president of the United States. Whereas his opponents and the political class in general seem hyper aware that their words will be picked apart and used against them. Trump willfully disregards this fact as a lifelong salesman, he has a hucksters knack for selling the feeling, even if the ideas and facts that underscore it are spurious racist or just plain incomprehensible. So I thought it would be illuminating to look at a trump answer to a simple question. In this case, Jimmy Kimmel asking trump whether or not it's wrong to discriminate against people based on their religion, referring to trump's proposal to temporarily ban all Muslims from entering the United States. This 220 word, exactly one minute answer displays. I think a range of the things that trump uses all the time in his speech, the first thing to note is how simple this languages of the 220 words, a 172 or 78 percent are only one syllable, and often they come in a rhythmic series like a volley of Jabs, ending with one of his buzzwords.

Speaker 1:          02:25          We have to get down to the prop. Thirty nine words or 17 percent are two syllables long. Only four words have three syllables, three of which are the word. Tremendous, tremendous, tremendous, and just two words are four syllables long, California, which he's forced to use because it has less syllables than San Bernardino and temporary, which he swallows and it's temporary. I've had so many people just breakdown fits with the study done by the Boston Globe that put all 2016 presidential candidates announcement speeches through the flesh, kincade readability tests to determine their respective grade level rankings. Donald Trump's speech came out at a fourth grade reading level. Now for reference, Ben Carson came out at sixth grade. Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush were speaking at an eighth grade reading level, and Bernie Sanders was way up in high school, a sophomore to be exact. Now, this isn't only down to word or syllable choice.

Speaker 1:          03:22          It's about sentence construction to trump favors simple sentences like, and we have a real problem. There's a tremendous hatred out there. Rarely does he use complex sentences or independent clauses. You also favors the second person. A lot of time addressing listeners directly with commands. Look at Paris, look at what happened in Paris. Look at what happened in past. Look at what happened last week in California or implicating us in what he's saying as if we've already agreed and you watched last night and you see people talking. He's really good at this at framing negative response as an overreaction. That was subsequently realized as such. If you remember when I did that a week ago, it was like bedlam all of a sudden and you watch last night and you see people talking to say, well, trump has a point. We have to get down to the problem. Maybe the most important technique trump utilizes and he does this more than anyone I've ever heard, is ending his sentences with strong, punchy words.

Speaker 1:          04:17          A lot of times he'll rearrange the beginning of a sentence awkwardly so that he can end strong. For example, here, it would probably be more natural to say you can't solve a problem until you find out what the root cause is, but he brings the is forward to end on root cause. He does the same here and it looks like that's what he was about to do at the end before Kim will cut some off. These final words are crucial for trump. They're pointed and taken together. Sketch the theme of the entire answer are dead. Die Badly injured problem root cars. Thank you Edna Bravo service problem. In some sense, it's these words that audiences remember, especially when the rest of his speech is incoherent. Like the best salesman. Trump keeps it simple. He repeats a lot and we have a real problem. What is the problem? We do have a problem.

Speaker 1:          05:06          We have to get down to the problem and he uses his favorite words over and over, tremendous, tremendous, tremendous service, and he always seems to have friends who are part of the group that he's currently insulting. Calling him up and thanking him for the privilege. Many of them called me and they said, you know, Donald, you're right. We have a problem. Look, there is a problem. Donald trump knows when to sound incredulous or forceful. He has good comedic instinct. You could even call him woody, but you can't call him smart, are well informed. The best salesman could sell you a TV without knowing anything about it because the TV isn't what matters. What matters is you, and if you are an American citizen who for years has listened to politicians sound sophisticated while accomplishing nothing, you might just be primed for something that is everything they are not, but the next time you feel like Donald trump has a point, do yourself a favor and look at his words.
