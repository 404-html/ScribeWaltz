Speaker 1:          00:02          Recently, I was trying to decide whether or not I should buy a wide angle lens for this camera and in order to make that decision, I employed the timeless technique of the pros and cons list. In the process of making that list, I happened to discover that the pros, cons, lists, technique, something so simple that it had to be used by a human since time immemorial is actually a relatively recent invention by none other than our stupidly accomplished forefather Benjamin Franklin to somewhat hilarious. Letter to Joseph priestly in 17, 72, Franklin explains it thusly. My way is to divide half a sheet of paper by a line into two columns, writing over the one pro and over the other con than during three or four days consideration. I put down under different head shots,

Speaker 2:          00:45          hints of the different motives that at different times occur to me for or against the law. When I had that got them all together in one view, I endeavored to estimate their respective whites. I'm going to act accordingly. Now, Franklin may merely

Speaker 1:          01:03          have been the first person to write this idea down, not the first to use it when it got me thinking about concepts that appeared to me as timeless, but which only seemed so because I'm trapped in this particular place at this particular time. For example, the number zero, we use it every day in conversation, none, Nada, Zip, Zilch, zero goose egg, but as a concept zero took many centuries to develop and a number of our greatest minds to comprehend fully the best mathematicians of ancient Greece didn't even have a name for zero. It didn't like it does for us. Serve as a place holder for writing big numbers. It wasn't until 6:50 add that Indian mathematician, Brahma gooped finally formalized how to reach zero through addition and subtraction that the concept took shape and it wasn't fully understood for another thousand years when Newton and live nets invented calculus and what it actually means to divide by zero from Matt.

Speaker 1:          01:57          Totally normal segue to sex, though heterosexuality is something we invoke to an almost ridiculous degree in contemporary society. The term actually dates to the mid 19th century and a letter written by Austro-hungarian journalist Carl curt bent in the letter carrier, Benny coins, the terms for Hetero and homosexuality as a way to suggest that there's no hierarchy between the two ways of life, that they're just different inborn expressions of sexuality. It wasn't until later in the 19th century that psychiatrists and psychoanalysts established heterosexuality as a synonym for normal and homosexuality is somehow deviant. Before that, people were persecuted for a certain sexual acts like sodomy or pedophilia. The creation and coopting of these terms enabled the persecution of orientation. Okay. What about the idea of ambition? Surely a timeless concept for admirable striving up the social ladder. Actually ambition is only as old as the social ladder is.

Speaker 1:          02:54          It wasn't until the Middle Ages that social mobility became a viable option for members of society before the 16th century social position was ordained by God and classes were her medically sealed part. Nobody not born there could get in or even entertain. The idea of doing so. Ambition comes from the Latin and beer, which means to go around specifically to go around canvassing for votes as in the old Roman system. In ancient times, it was always used as a negative term group together with pride and vainglory, but when the middle ages ended and modernity, dawn, the English word ambition enters common usage as something positive to legitimize and reinforce the social climbing of the new world. Fast forward to today and it's impossible to imagine office spaces without posters like this. Finally childhood, a timeless archetype of purity and innocence known in the late 19th and 20th century. Children were employed as laborers and their work was seen as crucial to contributing to the family income.

Speaker 1:          03:55          It was only after the passing of a number of child labor laws that prohibited them from work that society began treating children in the way that we think of now as explicitly noncommercial, as sacred, imbued with an almost religious pure. Instead of being individuals meant to secure the future for their parents. The roles were reversed and parents were obliged to protect children from the harsh realities of adult life and his children's ceased to be productive economic forces. They reemerged in the economy as consumers and the sentimental space they occupied was aggressively commercialized. Before this shift in the culture, the concept of childhood was much less. Hello to the point that even the death of a child was received with a certain amount of aloofness and detachment, zealous or quotes, a contemporary man on this subject to lose a child when first brought into life is very hard, but it is a tax we must pay.

Speaker 1:          04:48          It's an attitude that's hard to imagine in a time like ours when the most horrific and emotionally painful event of recent memory was the death of 20 young children in Newtown, Connecticut in 2012. The majority of those who died today, we're children, a beautiful little kids between the ages of five and 10 years old. I'm not making a value judgment on any of these shifts in our culture. For me, it's extremely humbling to know that my conception of human nature is merely a reflection of a moment in history. Many, if not all of these things are historical accidents, not some great fulfillment of the way humanity was always going to advance. They express the wills of individuals in meshed in moralities as blind to the past as we are. The more we understand that fact, the more benevolent our own blind push forward will be.

She's here to tell you that if you are interested in this topic, there's a couple of other videos I did in which I explored these topics. One on concept of love and one on the concept of logic and I'll put the links here that you can click on. Maya really wants to tell you to subscribe to this channel, follow me on Tumblr and twitter and make sure that you stick around for the next one.
