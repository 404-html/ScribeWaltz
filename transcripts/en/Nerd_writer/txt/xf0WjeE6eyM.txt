Speaker 1:          00:01          Unlike in live action, cinematography, lighting in animation, it's something that's built totally from scratch. In other words, well in live action, light is controlled sometimes too brilliant effect in animation. Light is created. Of course these days a lot of animated light is computer generated, meaning that virtual lights can be placed in three d environments and actually play off solid surfaces like they would in real life, like the control of actual lights. This too can be used to beautiful effect, but today I want to talk about lighting as it was done in traditional hand drawn cell animation, particularly in the groundbreaking anime film by Ketso Hero Tomo, Akira. Now Kira is well known for it's painstaking animation. Every frame of the film was composed with the closest attention to detail and color and that gives it an unmatched richness and soul. For this reason, the cure, it is also a film that's been painstakingly picked over and analyze by others, but one thing I haven't heard much about is the way that lighting is used by the filmmakers. Because I see the films, many lights. There are different qualities and textures as a powerful motif and symbol and a vital element of it's genius

Speaker 2:          01:16          backgrounds must still be photographed by the master camera in technicolor. Yeah. They operate with the Donald Duck on top of a background as the overhead camera exposures. One frame of film,

Speaker 1:          01:27          like I said, Akira was a film made in the cell animation style developed in the first half of the 20th century, which involves drawing and painting on a transparent slides and layering them over a background frames composed like this were photographed and strung together to create the animation. This Two d traditional style coupled with the tropes of anime means that the light and Akira is specific and pronounce the lines between shadow and light, are distinct and evocative in the same way that film noir lighting is and like in film noir light and Akira is intimately connected to the city at night. This for example, is the very first shot after the opening credits of flickering neon sign for the neighborhood bar. Where can neda is waiting for his friends? Nothing could more concisely communicate the rundown dystopic feeling of the future. Tokyo Tomo is going to present us with in the very next shot and throughout the film.

Speaker 1:          02:20          Indeed, this is a city as sorted romantic and multifarious as the lights that slash across it's million surfaces to make a delicate whole, the city where the disenfranchised young mark their presence and their personalities with the streaks of light that their motorcycles leave behind the city where authority is as much a blinding spotlight as it is a gun or a badge. Oh, Tomo has said that he wanted Tokyo itself to be a major character and Akira and one of the ways he flushes this out is with light, particularly neon neon has a special significance for both Tokyo and the cyberpunk genre. It is the bitter but beautiful that signifies both the colorful radiance and the Gadi consumerism of modernity. That dark dystopian side of which remain cyberpunks basic focus. Tokyo for its part, has been a cultural hub for neon signage ever since 1957. When the Sukkot company unveiled its giant 30 foot neon billboard in the Ginza district revealing its new name.

Speaker 1:          03:23          Sony. Since then, the science have proliferated becoming a signature, even a tourist attraction of Tokyo's nightscape and novels like William Gibson's neuromancer films like blade runner took the vivid and suggestive qualities of Tokyo's neon as their palate for oblique tech. Saturated future, Akira continues this tradition, but here are the neon quality, infuses all the light sources of the film, both inside and out. There's the neon on the buildings, but there's also the neon bright screens that shine and the characters faces and the neon control panels of bright primary colors. The spotlights that rove in the sky are like giant neon tubes being waved back and forth. Machine gun fire is a barrage of neon streaks. Even the sunlight shining through the windows has a bluish neon quality to it. In neon neo, Tokyo and its inhabitants aren't so much lit as caught caught in this huge incandescent web that serves only the mandates of money capital in that web government is as impotent as a biker gang made up of disaffected children.

Speaker 1:          04:29          It's funny that industry business is notably absent from the films plot because it's DNA seems to be in the corners of everything. We blink and you might miss a newsreader at the beginning of the movie shining from another flickering lights, source reporting riots of unemployed workers after tax reforms. Maybe this is why tetsuo at once, the protagonist and the antagonist of the film, a boy who gains extremely Mary psychic power so often produces a disruption in the light around him, whether it's in his own mind or in the form of explosion or in the aura around him, even in the vibrant dancing waveland that his brain patterns create indeed psychic power most fully realized in Tetsuo and his counterpoint, Akira represent the only kind of power that can have an effect on the state of things. In Neo Tokyo. This is perhaps the reason that the protesters turned to Akira for their salvation because even when the authorities turned their biggest spotlight on him, a mega satellite laser that takes the name of our son, he comes out the victor.

Speaker 1:          05:36          In the end, the salvation represented in Tetsuo comes at the cost of ruin. A catastrophe which consumes neo Tokyo in the form of a giant ball of light, one single uniform white light that erases the countless artificial lights of the city. Oh, Tomo seems to suggest that there's some freedom in this, some rebirth as true sunlight wipes across the city in patches. When you have to draw light 24 times in every second of a two hour movie, it must be the case that you gain a new appreciation for how it can tell the story of its own and that's what our Tomo and his crew have done and Akira light is layered into the story like it's layered into the animation cells pointing toward meaning behind the film, at the corners of it, and illuminating from different angles, the characters and their place in this neon world. In other words, a Kira is a great example of how you animate light.
