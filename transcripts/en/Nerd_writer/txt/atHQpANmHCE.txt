Speaker 1:          00:07          I started analyzing paintings as a way to confront the problem of not engaging with certain forms of genres of art. I mean you stand at a museum, look at a Kandinsky or a monet or Surat, and wonder what exactly am I supposed to feel here? Certain paintings seem particularly stubborn, unwilling to move even an inch in your direction, leaving you with a massive void to fill with unanchored interpretation, but what about paintings that do the opposite? Rename a greets. The treachery of images moves more than an inch in the direction of the viewer. It goes all the way. The painting speaks in a language that we can understand, which is to say language itself, sustain. Pass on peep. This is not a pipe. The painting actually says something. It engages. It talks. So what's it trying to say? First, let's talk for a moment about renamer greed.

Speaker 1:          01:05          One of the most famous and lasting of the surrealist artists. A man who never really thought of himself as a painter, more a thinker that used images to express himself once he landed on an aesthetic style. It never really changed or evolved throughout his career. Well versed in philosophical writing from Plato to Food Co, he used that style to investigate ideas. His program was to confuse, to evoke mystery, to show us that what we want is always behind the thing we see and that the obstruction can never be removed completely because it's not in the object. It's envisioned and thought itself. The treachery of images approaches these themes directly. The painting at first is obvious in its message. It shows an image of a pipe and then underneath the image it tells or reminds the viewer that this is not a pipe and we can infer the rest.

Speaker 1:          02:00          Obviously that's not a pipe. It's a representation of a pipe and regret means to show us that representations are not the real thing. They only resemble the real thing, but of course that's common sense. Who in the world would argue the opposite position, but a curious question comes out of this. If someone showed you this image and asked you what it was, what would you say? Probably you'd say it's an apple, right? Or what about this image? It's a man or this. This is a train. This is a house, this is a dog. This is a hand. This is a pipe. This little accident of language is not really an accident at all. For many hundreds of years, human beings have supposed that language and reality had an organic relationship that the names of things in a way arose out of the things themselves, that a tree was in fact a tree that Kanye West is in fact Kanye west and that a pipe is really a pipe.

Speaker 1:          02:59          All of that was challenged by the famous linguist Ferdinand and sauce. You're an extremely influential figure who saw that a thing and it's name have a totally arbitrary relationship that we don't really know things but only access their shadow through language in which everything has a meaning in the context of the system. After so many centuries of trusting the word implicitly, these insights were hard. One so hard, one that marguerite saw that the old wrongheaded ways of thinking about language. We're still hiding in the way we thought and talked about images. Realistic painting plays on resemblance and resemblance suggests a hierarchy that the image of a pipe resembles that it points outside language to the thing in itself. The falseness of this claim is what inspired the abstract artists to move beyond resemblance into a field in which painting had no reference in reality. As such, we agreed on the other hand, makes this point using the false premises of resemblance and shatters them from within.

Speaker 1:          04:04          The visual secret dependence on language is laid bare in the treachery of images. Indeed, that dependence is the treachery of images. Here we have an image and a sentence laid out like a page from a botanical textbook begging to be connected, but why should we connect them? Why should the sentence and the image refer to one another? How do we know that the word this points upward? Of course we don't know, but the Pronoun, the resemblance and the name, I'll make that connection inevitable and it's that inevitability that's made real in every aspect of our lives. We go about our days confident that everything we see could be said and that the images we say it could be seen, but if you've ever used the phrase you had to be there, you know that these are two realities that do not overlap in the way we act like they do. This is not a pipe. Yes, but this is not a pipe either. And if this is not a pipe than the sentence scrawled in it's cute schoolboy. Cursive is actually a contradiction. The contradiction that pulls the whole painting apart at the seams and makes it utter nonsense. I don't know if Margaret laughed about that, but I hope he did because what's more forceful, not moving an inch in the direction of the viewer or moving a question all the way into the center of the viewer's mind. That on the slightest prodding and examination implodes.

Speaker 1:          05:39          Hey everybody, thanks for watching. Boy, that was, that was really fun to do. Um, I wanted to let you know that there are only five nerd writer mugs left on my patrion page. So if you want to claim one of the last few, click anywhere here on the mug or in the description. Also, a lot of people in the last video commented who didn't live in the US saying they might also be interested in a mug. So if you are, let me know in comments below so that I can gauge interest in. Maybe we can do a whole separate batch for you guys. Thank you so much for supporting me on Patrion guys. Really it is. I say this again and again, but it. It is what makes this channel possible. It wouldn't exist. The nerd writer would not exist without your help and I am trying to build it up a little by little. It's a model for supporting content that I really believe in. I mean, you pay to get the content that you want. There's nothing in between you and me. It's just me and you. A, it's a beautiful break. It's my birthday today. Actually. It will be my birthday yesterday, but it's a beautiful birthday gift from you guys and I will see you guys next Wednesday.
