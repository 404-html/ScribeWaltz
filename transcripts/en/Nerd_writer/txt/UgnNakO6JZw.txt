Speaker 1:          00:13          Today I want to take a little bit of a closer look at a scene from Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece vertigo. It's an early scene in the movie when the retired detective Scotty, played by Jimmy Stewart visits an old college friend, Gavin elster. Specifically, I want to look at how hitchcock blocks this five minute and 22nd scene and how is staging of the characters adds to the story I married into it now. I should say that there are two ways to look at the scene from the perspective of a first time viewer who has to take the information it presents at face value or from the perspective of someone who's already seen the film and knows the true intentions and outcomes of what's revealed here. I'm going to take a look at this from the second perspective, which means that there's going to be spoilers, so just a heads up, so if you've seen vertigo, you know that in this scene Gavin elster is spinning and elaborate lie in order to create an alibi so that he can get away with murdering his wife and his plan. Scotty is the alibi. Gavin tell Scotty that his wife has possessed by an old spirit, ask Scotty to spy on her, then switches his wife out for an actress who plays that part cleverly exploiting Scotty's desire and his vertigo, Gavin and the actress murder his wife and leave Scotty traumatized, believing that

Speaker 2:          01:29          the wife committed suicide.

Speaker 1:          01:33          The scene in question, the one in Gavin's office at his ship building business, comes only 11 minutes into the film and comprises Gavin's attempt to learn Scotty into his deception.

Speaker 2:          01:43          How did you get in the shipbuilding business? I'm married.

Speaker 1:          01:48          The scene starts with Gavin seated at his desk and Scotty standing behind a chair in the center of the room. In the beginning, it's Scotty who's dominant. He's asking questions moving around Gavin's desk, leisurely inspecting various objects like a retired detective, Mike by acting and sitting rather coyly Gavin lures. Scotty into his space and his confidence under the illusion of sincerity.

Speaker 2:          02:12          What was it like to hear? How long have you been back? Almost a year,

Speaker 1:          02:17          Scotty. He continues his inspection moving to the other side of the room to see an old picture of San Francisco. His back is turned just as Gavin makes a key confession.

Speaker 2:          02:26          Yes, I would like to live here. Then kinda excitement. A freedom.

Speaker 1:          02:33          It's that freedom. He desires freedom from his wife that's launching this cruel plan. Of course the audience can't know it then, but hitchcock's foreshadowing. It's there and it's in the staging to while he sits. Gavin is in front of a window that shows a shit behind being put together piece by piece, not unlike the story he's about to spin for. Scotty.

Speaker 2:          02:53          Would you like a drink now? No, I don't think so. A little early in the day for me.

Speaker 1:          02:59          Scotty moves toward Gavin again and sits in the center chair asking him the purpose of their meeting and hear the power changes hands. As Scotty sits in the hot seat, Gavin stands and begins to tell his story. He moves around the desk and up a couple of stairs so that he's towering over Scotty even higher.

Speaker 2:          03:20          I want you to follow my wife. No, it's not. They were very happily married. Well, I'm afraid to sound harsh. May come to someone. Did.

Speaker 1:          03:31          When Gavin makes his big reveal that his wife is being supernaturally possessed, hitchcock brings them in closer to Scotty so that the ankle is even more extreme far now from being coy, Gavin's blocking becomes aggressive and the next thing that happens is perhaps the most interesting moment in the scene. Kevin and Scotty remain fixed in their positions, but the camera dollies backwards to bring them both into frame. Now the camera moves all over the scene, but this movement is the only that really calls attention to itself. This is a reminder that for hitchcock blocking involves the position of the camera too. There are three elements in this scene, not just to Scotty expresses his disbelief at the situation, and Gavin sitting again, softer in tone, acts like he understands.

Speaker 2:          04:17          Sorry, I wasted your time. Thanks for coming in. And Scotty.

Speaker 1:          04:20          Scotty, he gets up and moves toward the door to leave. Gavin lets this happen because he knows that too. Really Rope Scotty and he has to make it seem like it's his own choice. Scotty apologizes and Gavin moves into his space again and before Scotty can say anything, Gavin starts in on the details of his life, how his wife seems to fade in and out of her personality, how she wanders around to odd places and Gavin himself is wandering in the second room which is raised a few steps like a stage and Scotty moves to the chair on the opposite side, like an audience member watching

Speaker 2:          04:54          his performance. I've followed her one day wash check coming out of the apartment. I went, I didn't know even walked a different way. Got into her car and drove out to golden gate park. Five months, sat by the lake, staring across the water, the pillows, the stand on the shore, you know, portals of the past. Is there a long time without moving? I had to leave. Get back to the office. When I got home that evening, I asked her what she'd done all day. She said she did not have to golden gate park and sat by the lake. That's a speedometer on her car. She that she drove 94 months.

Speaker 1:          05:41          Of course, what Gavin is doing here isn't recounting details, but planting them in Scotty's head details that will match with his actresses actions in the following scenes. This layer of stage performance is a stroke of genius on Hitchcock's part because on one level, vertigo is about the power of film and the power of narrative, how a really good narrative can manipulate us, whether it's for the purposes of entertainment or something more sinister. The narrative laid out for Scotty in this scene will drive the whole rest of the story. It'll drive Scotty's actions in the first part of the film and eventually it'll drive his own obsessive narrative creation and the second part I've got to know this guy where she goes and what she does before I get involved with doctor. Talked to the doctors at all are carefully. When Gavin steps back down into the lower room, the monologue ends and the conversation resumed.

Speaker 1:          06:34          Scotty gets up from the chair to protest Gavin's request for help, but he's moving toward him. Gavin mirrors his movement and approaches Scotty entering his space again. This time with his final barking, a simple request. We're going to an opening of the opera tonight with dining into Annie's. First. You can see how then the scene ends with Gavin literally leaning into Scotty and Scotty finally relenting. The trap has been set. Hitchcock even frames it so that the two are overlapping. I've always loved the scene in Vertigo in college. I used to diagram it out in my notebooks, trying to figure out where he put the camera on what lenses he used, but it's the blocking for these five continuous minutes that are the real mark of hitchcock's mastery of the form. The scene is small and often overlooked, but it holds up the rest of the film. How many other directors could choreograph this conversation in such a way that it works like a dance where one man is leading and performing and the other is a spectator and a patsy without knowing it. Yet both Gavin elster and this scene have hitchcock written all over them. In other words, I don't think it's a coincidence that the man himself isn't too far away.
