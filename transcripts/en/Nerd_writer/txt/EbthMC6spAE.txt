Speaker 1:          00:00          They must goes into a podiatrist's office and the podiatry side that says, what's the problem? And the mom says, what's the problem? Where do I begin? Man?

Speaker 2:          00:10          Norm Mcdonald is one of those comedians who functions as a litmus test for people's sense of humor. If you find norm hilarious, for example, I know that your sense of humor and mine are probably pretty similar. Norm splits people and if he does so more than most, I think it's because his vision of comedy is unflinching unflinchingly devoted to what he finds funny, which means that he won't ever try to modify his work to appease an audience. Of course, this has led to what I think is the mistaken notion, one that you often see in youtube comments that norm just doesn't care what people think

Speaker 1:          00:45          because I go to work for a gregory, a linen, which honestly I don't even know what I'm doing anymore. I don't even know if Gregory Olin Yvette's knows. He only knows that he has power over me and that seems to bring up

Speaker 2:          00:58          in us. I think norm cares deeply about his audiences. He wouldn't spend thousands of hours honing his material if you didn't want to make people laugh. He just doesn't let the audience dictate the direction of this work. He doesn't pander. In fact, during his time at snl as the host of weekend update, he often did the exact opposite norms, distaste for performing in front of an audience that was essentially forced to laugh, urged him to tell jokes that would shock them into silence or gasps. A decade before Ricky Gervais' made a splash by making fun of celebrities at the Golden Globes norm hosted the sps with jokes.

Speaker 1:          01:34          Hey, began the first defensive player to win the heisman trophy, and congratulations, Charles. That is something that no one can ever take away from you unless you kill your wife later, in which case

Speaker 2:          01:46          take bravery. It takes dedication.

Speaker 1:          01:49          At night I sometimes wake up and I turned to some old lady in my bed that's on my arm, a lady that I once loved duck. I don't know where to turn to my youngest Alexandria. She fell in the. In the, in the cold of last year.

Speaker 2:          02:11          Norms, dedication to the craft is almost inhuman and so much of it is unseen. He's one of the smartest, well-read people in stand up particularly well read in Russian literature. If you couldn't tell by the names that he's making up in the mouth joke, and yet his whole act is predicated on this folksy, dopey innocence. He's like that magician from the prestige who devotes his whole life to a character just to pull off a great trick. This

Speaker 1:          02:36          he's the truth. This is one owner can detect this total devotion to his own self sacrifice at my other boy. This is the hardest pill to swallow my after boy, Greg Arrow. Then a little

Speaker 2:          03:04          I no longer love him, not trying to pull off tricks. Of course he's trying to pull off jokes, a joke with a premise and the punchline, it's kind of funny. Norm was known for his super short jokes during this weekend update period and now he's known for these super long rambling jokes that he often tells on late show appearances. It's these longer jokes which bear a resemblance to shaggy dog stories that often get him labeled as an anti comic or a medical clinic, but he strongly insists that he is neither of these things in interviews. Norm rejects anything that sees itself as above comedy. Looking down on it either to ridicule or to comment. His jokes always have punchlines. Punchlines. That makes sense. Whether or not you think they're funny, he can deliver a joke quickly. Hey, you know the funniest part of doing an office Congo line. When you look back and realize they're doing it alone and you're not in an office, you're in a psychiatric hospital where he can string out punchlines like pearls on a wire across a long story. This joke from his special me doing standup is 12 minutes long.

Speaker 1:          04:11          Seems like there's too much news because now they have 24 hour news. Now, when I was a young boy, the news was half a hour. That was the whole.

Speaker 2:          04:19          It starts by talking about 24 hour news and eventually makes his way to a detailed description of how he would murder someone and the progression. It's completely natural.

Speaker 1:          04:29          I would take her body to the woods and barrier in a very, very, very deep grave along the way.

Speaker 2:          04:38          There was plenty of punchlines to laugh at and as things get crazier, you get drawn into a kind of.

Speaker 1:          04:44          A lady has vanished cetera. Fat. I'm Kinda happy it's Janice and not somebody I know to meet her one day. That would be a lot of fuck. I forgot. She vanished time. They will find you in a shallow grave. Serial killers are supposed to be so shrewd and cunning and you know, but then when it comes time for the grave, it'll hasty. You know, what I would do is I would like, I would look at the lay, I would select a lady and then I would follow her habits. You understand what I'm saying? What would I be a holding in my right hand in the parking lot, but a cheese sandwich. I got a whole fucking van full of, um, get in there and I would do that thing that makes me feel like God. And then I would take her body to the woods and barrier in a very, very, very deep brave,

Speaker 2:          05:42          which is have this joke is there if you want to look for it, the word choices, the freezing. It's all precisely chosen, but norm doesn't call attention to his own intelligence. The punchlines just appear like flashes of light.

Speaker 1:          05:54          If only the cowardice was stronger than perhaps grabs I couldn't bring myself to reach over to that cocked and loaded gun that lays on the bed. And then this hellish facade, one

Speaker 2:          06:12          constellation of comedy greats. Norm is among the least famous, but he's also one of the most underrated. That's because standup was never a stepping stone for him to greater success or greater fame, but an end in itself, an art to perfect is kind of comedy is built to last like a low frequency noise that might not demand the same kind of attention is high pitch sounds, but we'll travel a much greater distance in the end. Enormous jokes are the ones you'll remember latent to your life. The ones will all be telling for years to come because they're construction is sophisticated, but their delivery is easy to understand. Getting that balance exactly right is the work of an entire career, but norm mcdonald more than anyone else knows that a long winding journey is okay. As long as the payoff is worth it.

Speaker 1:          07:02          It says dark because I feel like a spider even though I have a ma just barely hanging on to my web with everlasting fire underneath me, I'm not feeling good and so the mice, the director says, math, man, you're a troubled but you shouldn't be seeing a psychiatrist. Why on earth did you come here? And then the Ma said, because the light was on, everybody's
