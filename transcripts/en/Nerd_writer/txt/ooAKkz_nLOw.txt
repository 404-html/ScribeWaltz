Speaker 1:          00:00          Coffee on Tuesday and block six. I was trying to figure out what I should do for my next blog, so I went upstairs and talked to my neighbors, told me he's been dying to go to the big scientology complex on sunset boulevard. So I said, perfect

Speaker 2:          00:26          with scientology. Here it is. Church of Scientology.

Speaker 1:          00:46          He didn't let us take the camera inside, so I'll just tell you what happened next. We were greeted by a receptionist who looked like he was 19 years old and looked us straight in the eye. Everybody in that building looks you straight in the eye. The first thing he did was pushed forward a piece of paper on what you were supposed to write, our first name or last name, our address, our phone number, and the reason why we were coming here, we said that we were interested in the religion and that we wanted to know more about it. So he suggested that we take the self guided multimedia tour.

Speaker 3:          01:09          This is an invitation to freedom, man can save his soul.

Speaker 1:          01:20          So in the back part of the lobbyists, all these interactive tvs where you can watch different aspects of scientology and move your way around and learn all different types of things. I got these two sample dvds first the way to happiness and seconds, scientology and overview. There was a booth on scientology ethics. There was a booth on the evil of psychiatry. I've never agreed with psychiatry

Speaker 3:          01:41          ever

Speaker 2:          01:45          before. I was a scientologist. I never agreed with psychiatry. And then when I started studying the history of psychiatry, I started realizing more and more why I didn't agree with psychiatry.

Speaker 1:          01:52          There was a booth that started to explain that the loss of p of scientology. There was a booth all about l Ron Hubbard. There was even a booth where you could see your own thoughts. Is the device that you used to do that looks like an old toy telephone. After the self guided multimedia tour, we went up front and asked to take personality tests. So I think me and Zee, I thought that it would be like a 10 to 20 question test, 200 questions. Some of the questions. Where do you feel ill at ease in the company of children? Do you whistle while you work? If a 10 year old was acting out of place, you would approve corporal punishment. You find yourself dwelling on past misfortunes. You rarely think about past failure during the type of person who's always thinking about what you could've done. Does it sometimes feel that all of reality is a dream? Finally a question. One hundred 92, they asked the question that they had been asking over and over in so many different ways, are you depressed?

Speaker 2:          02:41          It's very, very, very easy to see how if you are emotionally distressed state bank, a cow capture you, big old fucking that on you. For

Speaker 1:          02:52          someone who is depressed or who just feels particularly empty for someone who's tried psychology and psychiatry and it hasn't for them, why not adopt the idea that psychiatry is actually evil? Sometimes it's easy for us when we're in a vulnerable position to take the exact opposite stance of the stance that you had before when really the answer is not to flip your ideas 180 degrees, but only to adjust it a little bit him either way, but anyway, in five minutes the receptionist returned with the result of our personality tests. Here it is. You can see that it's a line graph showing where it is. You are in between the spectrum of several different traits. The young scientologist said to me, now, sir, this is not our opinion of you. This is a scientific analysis of your opinion of yourself. So we went over the results and he asked me a lot of questions which I tried to answer as honestly as I could, and a big deal was made. All the while about how practical scientology is. See, the first step that you take after you take the personality test is a series of communication courses. In those courses, you're meant to unlearn the ways that we've learned to imperfectness, communicate with each other, and I talked to a few scientologists there who all said that after those courses they really learn to open up themselves to communication and I believe that it works for them. Although it may be the clue to why they all seem a little bit brainwashed.

Speaker 4:          04:00          They're all learning communication in a way that makes them act the way they do. You know, I, I, I assume the communications courses and other courses that you have to take our very specific.

Speaker 1:          04:14          Anyway, the next step is purification. So I asked them what purification was thinking that it would be just a bunch of people sitting in a room trying to think away the toxins. He said, actually we have a few large Saunas and the facility and you sit in them and sweat out all the toxins and the next thing after that is the beginning of the bridge to total freedom. So here's where I had the question that I really wanted to ask, and that was where does the practical almost utilitarian side of scientology come into contact with the religious side? He couldn't answer that question. So I had to be taken to a new scientologists. So we walked over to another desk and I sat down and I asked the same question but a little bit, frank, or what do you worship here? Because Christianity, for example, has got the Bible and Jesus and this is the infallible words of their religion.

Speaker 1:          04:57          Now the second scientologists took the tack that there is no worship going on in scientology. Now I don't know if I really believe them on that, but taking him at his word. I said, then why do you call yourselves a religion? And he said, well, you know, the word religion has been usurped over the years. And I said, yeah, maybe that's true, but the religious people have had it for a good 2000 years, so let's, let's just give it to them. I said to him, I think you're alienating people by calling it a religion if all it really is is a self help community. Unfortunately that's when I had to leave because the building was closing and my neighbors, he had had to get back to our house.

Speaker 2:          05:30          So what did you think was interesting? I didn't know about their volunteer efforts. She made a big push about religion. You know, they know differ that much. They ask you to be good to other people, but I'm sure behind closed doors swing basically segregate people and

Speaker 1:          05:59          always put up walls. I don't know what I really believe about scientology. I don't know what I think goes on in there. I don't know where the money comes from. I don't know any of these things. To us on the outside looking in. Scientology is like a frog. We don't see past the doors, but I recommend anybody who's interested to go there because they will give you certain answers to certain questions and you can learn at least a little bit about the mystery that is scientology. Make your decisions on it for yourself, but just remember, give a fake name.
