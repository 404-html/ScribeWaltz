Speaker 1:          00:01          Coffee on a Tuesday block 13. Oh, hey, listen,

Speaker 2:          00:04          spider. You're trying to scare me because it's 13 flood.

Speaker 3:          00:11          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:21          Yeah, that's right. I said it. Raising awareness is for pussies. What we explained, you can see very clearly on this diagram that I just made, that there are three different types of rates. You can raise awareness, you can raise understanding, or you can raise money. Of those three, clearly one stands out as being for postings, so all you fund hipsters out there who grew your mustache for movember to raise some awareness for prostate cancer. I say yes, it is better than doing nothing, but you are nonetheless still pussies

Speaker 2:          00:55          to prove it to you. I'm here at the Comerica Bank Tower in downtown Los Angeles and I'm about to walk up 50 flights of steps to raise awareness for cystic fibrosis. Look at all these pussies. I'm going to do one better. Not only am I going to climb 50 flights of stairs when I'm going to raise some understanding in the process, so every 10 flights, I'm going to explain a little bit more to you about what? Cystic. Okay, here we go.

Speaker 4:          01:26          Yeah,

Speaker 5:          01:41          you have a team that makes it

Speaker 2:          01:57          10 existing fibrosis is an inherited disease that affects the lungs and the digestive system and affected gene and its protein product cause the body to produce unusually thick and sticky mucous that clogs the lungs that leads to life threatening lung infections and obstructs the pancreas which makes enzymes that help the body break down food and absorb nutrients. Currently about 70,000 people in the world happened. That's about 100,000, so maybe you know someone who hasn't. Maybe you don't. I do these 22 years, the median life expectancy of a sufferer of cystic fibrosis days late 30, 50 years ago. It was about six months necessarily 20, already filled the muscle on the muscle, burn up, power it suffers of cystic fibrosis, have a mutation on their seventh chromosome on a gene called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator for cf ball, cftr closest thick respiratory secretions that are hard to clear from the sewing bacteria become more easily tracked and causing infection and inflammation in the. Also in the pancreas organ that helps you break down all the fat, protein, carbs, and fat. You will find the disease blocks these enzymes that prohibits digestion. This means that necessarily fat soluble score, vitamins don't get absorbed into the bloodstream. Okay. 10 flights.

Speaker 2:          03:32          Honestly, this is easy. Thank you so much. So the medicine, we follow the same enzymes, vitamins, antibiotics to stop infection, mucus thinner as an bronco. Dilators to facilitate read, suffers from cystic fibrosis, digests less. They have to eat more, more calories and more fat all while maintaining a healthy weight. Because a healthy body makes for a strong immune system. And in this case it has to work overtime. Exercise like this is a must, so let's

Speaker 5:          04:06          good.

Speaker 2:          04:17          Okay, so how is their life different from ours? They have to take different medicines all day long. They have to use a nebulizer to inhale special ms medicines directly into their lungs. They have to watch their sugar because diabetes is especially prevalent among the cystic fibrosis community. They're in and out of the hospital. They can't smoke cigarettes or marijuana because they're especially susceptible to fungal and bacteria. They can drink alcohol, but only in moderation though that might be said for everyone should have scratched, scratched, shouldn't stress

Speaker 5:          04:51          like a before. Thank you.

Speaker 2:          05:12          He's let it be known that Justin Syriana the camera and also made it up 50 flights with me. Thank you very much, Jay. That's not a trick. Now. That'd be really ready to take it away at home. Thanks Evan.

Speaker 1:          05:27          So do you remember the cft? Rg? Well, here's what's happening on a molecular level. A gene is like a little instruction manual. It tells amino acids how to shape themselves into proteins. Proteins are these wildly complex shapes like bunches of ribbon that perform various functions in the bottle. The shape is everything. It's a name and a job all in one. It tells everything around what it's there to do. The cftr protein coming from the CFTR gene sits on the membrane of cells and the coming and going of sodium chloride or salt. Okay, good. So far, the mutation associated with cystic fibrosis is a faulty instruction. The protein is constructed wrong and instead of facilitating the passions of salt, it blocks it. And this is what creates the mucus buildup and all the other troubles. Now there's a drug in development by vertex pharmaceuticals called VX seven, seven.

Speaker 1:          06:19          It's a CFTR potentiator and it aims to increase the function of those effective cftr genes by increasing the gating activity or the ability for ions to be transported across the cell membrane. It's currently in phase three of FDA trials and it has had promising results so far along partly due to the fundraising done by the cystic fibrosis foundation or the CFF. And we can only hope for the best. This is why raising understanding is better than raising awareness because you know where your money is going if you donate to this cause, you're donating to the research and development of gene therapy treatments that will attack this disease at its root and potentially cure those affected with cystic fibrosis forever. We all get just one life and then we die and that's the end. All we can hope for is to get 60 or 80 or 100 years of it to do what we love, to spend it with family and friends to create, to learn to do whatever we feel is donate and give those with cystic fibrosis the chance of 100 years. It's why raising money is better than raising understand and it's what they all did

Speaker 6:          07:22          and it's what he did, which I guess makes me the pussy.

Speaker 7:          07:30          No, you could find information about where to donate the dude
