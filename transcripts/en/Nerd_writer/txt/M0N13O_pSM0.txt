Speaker 1:          00:01          Coffee on the Tuesday and black.

Speaker 2:          00:11          Yay.

Speaker 1:          00:24          So today I want to talk about the greatest writer that ever lived. Now maybe you know, or maybe you don't know, but Roland emerick's new movie, anonymous tickets is this Friday.

Speaker 3:          00:32          We'll know William Shakespeare, the most famous author of all time, right, heard of 37 plays, 154 sonnets. Several epic poem and why we are here today. But what if I told you Shakespeare never wrote a single word.

Speaker 1:          00:53          Movies meant to explore the theory that William Shakespeare, the average man from Stratford, did not actually write any poems or playing. Now, conspiracy theories like this aren't new, but it may be important to note that not a single person doubted shakespeare until about 150 years after his death. In 17, 69, Herbert Lawrence publishes a book called the life and adventures of common sense suggests that the culprit might be in fact Francis Bacon. Shakespeare depicted as a degenerate and a thief steals from the character called wisdom, who is the father of common sense. And wisdom is meant to be amongst my father's baggage. She presently has designed upon a commonplace book in which was contained and infinite variety of modes and forms to express all the different sentiments of the human mind, but this allegation is forgotten in its time and isn't revived until Delia bake in know relationships with the proper treatment and her 582 page book, the philosophy of the plays of Shakespeare unfold in it.

Speaker 1:          01:42          She suggests that Bacon was directing a group of intellectuals who actually wrote all the place. Oh, clever bacon. The Bacon theory falls completely into madness. When in 18, 88, Ignatius Donnelly starts claiming that he's found codes inside the texts. That's not all. By the way, Bacon, according to Donald, is also Christopher Marlowe and maintained to check out these two final lines from the epilogue of the tempest as you from crimes with pardon be lecture, indulgence set me free. According to the audience. These lines are actually an Anagram for tempest of Francis Bacon. Lord Vellum, do you narrow divulge me words? It is a shame that the literary appears twice in the first lines in three times the second lines, but no problem say that they come here, just pop it apostrophe here and Bob's your uncle. Apostrophes are so helpful like that, but the man who was more recently replaced back in as the elite contender, the protagonist, the Roland emerick's film anonymous Edward de Vere, the 17th earl a box for this theory was advanced in two large books by Charlton alcorn and his wife.

Speaker 1:          02:38          This star of England and the mysterious William Shakespeare of the central arguments, what the man from strapper couldn't possibly have had the brain or the experience to write all those plays. Only the Lord could have written them to do their, had the perfect social background, living for years and Queen Elizabeth Court and three did not want his name to be known because a writing plays was considered a vulgar pursuit for royalty and be the place show so much slimy, corrupt, loyal behavior that it would have just totally blown up his spot. And let's not leave out the secret codes single. Look at this line from act one. Scene five of the time is that of joint. Oh, curse. It's right. They never. I was born to set it right.

Speaker 4:          03:12          What? What? Oh, oh, no, no, no, no. Come on

Speaker 1:          03:19          about the poem by Ben Johnson and titled to the Memory of my beloved William Shakespeare and that Johnson called Shakespeare the swan of Avon. Oops. Sticking to bear. Have property on the Avon River. Nevermind that Shakespeare was born in, died in Stratford on bond. This Johnson poem was actually the preface to the first folio, which is the first time that all of Shakespeare's plays were collected in one place in 16, 23. The folio was prepared by John Hemorrhages and Henrico doctors who had worked with Shakespeare for 20 years and gave him repeated credit of authorship and nevermind. Also the Edward de Vere died in 16. Oh, four. And a play like the tempest for example, is clearly dated 2:16, 11. You know the [inaudible] have an answer for that. They have an answer for everything, but each arm reaches further and further out of its socket to find connections that just don't exist. And round and round we go.

Speaker 1:          04:01          Even Herman Melville and his final book, Billy Budd names the captain of the ship, Indomitable Edward, there, Melville later said on that subject, the names of all fine authors are fictitious ones simply standing as they do for the mystical, ever alluding spirit of all beauty which ubiquitously possesses men of genius, but I think we shouldn't let this make us complacent when it comes to the smearing of Shakespeare's name. The people who don't have as much craving for conspiracy as Roland Emmerich won't suddenly be turned by his movie, but the world is full of idiots. It's full of people sitting on their couches and watching TV and watching the trailer flicker by and saying to the other guy on the couch, hey, actually, you know, that's true. He never did write those plays. There's like evidence. There needs to be some respect for human genius, especially when that genius comes from simple beginnings because that is where most genius comes from. It comes from Lincoln Shyer or the Bronx, or it comes from Liverpool or Stratford. It grows out of practice and it comes from the stars and I don't mean from aliens. Oh, in, I mean that a genius can be any person who looks at a night sky full of stars and never gets over it for the rest of his life. He does not in the stars to hold our destiny, but in ourselves.
