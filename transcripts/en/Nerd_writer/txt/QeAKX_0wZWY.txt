Speaker 1:          00:04          So I was just watching the new live action beauty and the beast teaser trailer starring Emma Watson, another remake of a 19 nineties Disney animation film, and I noticed that the trailer ends with two instantly recognizable symbols, a red rose and an appeal to be our guest from the first films famous song. And it occurred to me that symbols like this have come to represent a new kind of emotional currency in Hollywood. The currency of intertextuality

Speaker 1:          00:45          picks you out something in a text, in this case, a movie that is shaped by another text that could be a film or a book or a play or a song. Intertextuality is something that you can't escape. It says oldest storytelling is. It's how language works. All language reaches back and is informed by how it was used in the past. But today there seems to be a new kind of intertextuality born out of the endless series of sequels, remakes and reboots, the adaptations and shared universities. And it's perfectly captured in that force awakens clip when the Millennium Falcon is revealed, or later when Han Solo and Chewbacca board their ship, or later still when bba pulls the cover off an old friend, what do we feel in these moments? It's a bit hard to pinpoint, but personally I feel a kind of free sawn, the chill. Everything I know about the intertextual object in question unloads onto my mind like the vision ray gets when she first touches Luke's. This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight, clumsy or random. As a block

Speaker 1:          01:54          intertextual. References can point to genre conventions. They can point to the texts influences or cultural and historical contexts, but in this new generation of films, more and more, the intertextual manifests itself as objects. People or situations specifically meant to trigger an emotional response in the viewer. It's weaponized intertextuality goodness. What's a bit troubling about this trend is that increasingly I'm seeing films use this kind of intertextual reference as a dramatic substitute. I mean, why else include Sour Ron in the hobbit trilogy, for example, when he appears nowhere in the book. It seems to me that [inaudible], that whole plot line was included purely for intertextual payoff, so you could cash out that feeling of, Oh, this is what these people were doing, decades old series are right for this kind of thing, and if you want a couple of examples of just how cheap these moments can be, just take a look at two big intertextual reveals. My name is ka

Speaker 2:          03:00          man. You're talking to now a man inside your head and stuff. I'll blofeld

Speaker 1:          03:08          surprise motherfuckers. It seems like this or kind of Unicorns blood. They'll keep your story alive, but only with half a soul. One of my favorite TV shows when I was a teenager was small, filled by its very nature of that show was built around intertextual cues. What made the show great the early seasons was how it took those cues and deconstructed them in unexpected ways. Namely in the friendship of Clark Kent and Lex Luthor. Its strength was that fan service payoffs played second fiddle to deeply drawn relationships, but in the later seasons, the show began to lean a little too heavily on intertextual objects at moments from the superman. Kennan, really DC comics has always had this problem because it's heroes are mythological, Batman and Superman are the quintessential intertextual characters. Just seeing them at all is exciting, but the recent Batman v Superman movie directed by Zack Snyder proved that the free sign of having these characters on screen together of having them fight each other was just no substitute for strong intelligent drama. Snyder had a similar issue with his film watchman. Almost every shot in that film is a compositional Matt to the comic. It's trying to adapt now for those who read and love that comment, there certainly is a thrill and seeing those frames and experiencing those textual moments come beautifully to life when that's all there is. The final feeling is an empty one.

Speaker 1:          04:33          I think when cinematic storytelling is confined by an economic situation like this one, where $300, million dollar bets have to be safe ones, weaponized intertextuality is going to be an inevitable byproduct. I mean, this year alone, we have coming up finding dory independence day, resurgence ghostbusters, the angry birds movie, a Jason Bourne sequels, rogue one, Star Trek beyond warcraft. Expect to be flooded with weaponized intertextuality at every turn. As I said before, I don't think franchises and shared universes are bad by default, quite the opposite at their best. They build interpretive communities and foster social bonds and increasingly alienated world. The kind of intertextuality that we're talking about can reflect these good qualities. Then when it's done right, when it's not a substitute for strong characters and a good story, it can be funny excluding America and go fuck yourself. It can be amusingly subversive and of course it can add to the drama while still being exciting as hell.

Speaker 1:          05:44          Hey everybody. Welcome to the nerd writer end screen. Thank you so much for watching that. That was so much fun to make and I love thinking about stuff like this. And if you want help me make more videos, you can click right below here and pledge a dollar or $3 per video, uh, on my patriot on page. The small pledges helped so much and I'll see you guys next Wednesday. Oh, and thank you so much for watching my video on taxes. I didn't think that we'd get a lot of views, but people really seem to like it. So, uh, so cool.
