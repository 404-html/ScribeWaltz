Speaker 1:          00:03          Secondary worlds are fascinating. It's no surprise that we're obsessed with them, that we want to explore them, learn more about how they work. Take a look at this app. Google chrome made for the release of the hobbit films. It's a hyper realistic rendering of middle earth, far from the sketches of tolkien himself farther still from the words you used to describe it. The chrome program can be considered an act of world building, an extension of tolkiens own world, building in the Lord of the rings and more intensely in the silmarillion. There's something so in chanting in the complexity of his vision, in its completeness, in the completeness of the languages and the fact that they work. It's impossible when reading Lord of the Rings, not to feel that middle earth is autonomous, that it exists despite your reading about these days, we have our pick of dense secondary world fantasy literature is filled with them.

Speaker 1:          00:58          Think of the Dune series or Narnia or the late Terry Pratchett's discworld novels. Think of the race to fill in the histories of star wars, in books, video games, and new films, or take the secondary world. We're most obsessed with at the moment the world of Westeros in George Rr Martin is a song of ice and fire. None of these worlds are our own, but each is internally consistent and each has developed audiences that hunger for the author to fill in the margins, the gaps, the geography, the backstories, the histories, and if the author won't, they'll do it themselves. Want to know more about correspond or Darth sidious visit pdf, perhaps the most exhaustive catalog of a secondary world ever made. Why are we so consumed by built worlds by the act of world building? Is this a generous obsession or a dangerous one? The great science fiction and fantasy writer m John Harrison once famously called world building the attempt to exhaustively survey a place that isn't there.

Speaker 1:          02:00          Harrison's point is that the world building of much fantastic fiction which takes toll keens legendary them as its archetype, shifts the focus of literature away from the act which is most vital to its usefulness. The act of reading world building in this view assumes a passive reader. It envisions a writer who photographs a secondary world, encodes it into language and a reader who receives this immersive experience like a film blissfully and perhaps willingly unaware that the world he experiences is a rhetorical construct. The only problem is that all these assumptions are based on false premises. You can't encode the world in language. Readers are never passive. They create the text as much as a writer does, and all texts are rhetorical constructs. In other words, writing is always a game. It's a transaction that emerges from a writer's implications and a readers. Interpretive toolbox. World building fiction seems to deny this transaction, replace it with a cleaner one in which the story on offer is like a clock, and the writer is like the clockmaker.

Speaker 1:          03:12          The problem is that this kind of fiction creates a dependency in the reader to know more, to know everything. I feel this way all the time when I'm watching game of thrones, it's what sends me online. Looking for backstories. Perhaps this is why Harrison's own take on the fantasy genre is great. Viera conium novels resists so forcefully this urge for dependency in Veera conium. Nothing is ever the same twice from story to story. Names change. History's changed. Characters recur, but it's never clear if they're the same people you met before. Like all books, Vira. Conium is just some words, says Harrison. There is no place, no society, no dependable furniture to make real. You can't read it for that stuff, so you have to read it for everything else. Everything else. That's the bill of goods. The ideas and insights that spring forth from the explosive act of reading the.

Speaker 1:          04:08          For the record, I think toking did offer that bill of goods. He offered a poetic utterance, a metaphor. It was the attempt of those who came after to literalize that metaphor and dilute its imagery by asking things like, what did sal ron look like? Or just how might an Elf regiment organize itself. It's important to note that world building is not exclusive to fantastic fiction. It's a staple of real world fiction as well, and indeed the real world. It's current popularity is unsurprising given our modern world, which is its own kind of fantasy. Indeed. This is what makes world building so potentially dangerous. The world building of fiction only greases the wheels for it's much more insidious and terrifying cousin political pro building the constructed world presented to us by politics, marketing, and the media. The act of narcissistic fantasy represented by the word l'oreal already exists well upstream of j Dot k rowling or Jrr tolkien.

Speaker 1:          05:12          Neither of them is anywhere near as successful at world-building as the geniuses who devised coke or the Catholic church. I am a huge fan of totalking and game of thrones and star wars, but I'm also wary and worried about a strain of passivity and people that world building fiction seems to best reflect and at worst encourage who we are is already hugely and powerfully managed by interested parties all around us. Maybe we all at least to seek out fiction, fantastic or otherwise. That's a bit more impish and challenging that demands our engagement that rattles our perspective and exposes the false fronts of the fantasy. We were born into the world that was built without our consent. Hey everybody. Thanks for watching.
