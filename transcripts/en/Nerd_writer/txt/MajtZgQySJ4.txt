Speaker 1:          00:00          Coffee on a Tuesday and blog 23 in an art studio.

Speaker 1:          00:20          Oh, sorry. I was just checking the twitter APP on my iphone. Now. Someone. Someone tweeted me. Actually that was like a minute ago. Now I'm reading New York Times article about the Syrian uprising. A really interesting, a really devastating to, but I'm actually. That was like a minute ago to now or, or um, uh, no, no, that actually, that was 20 minutes ago. I guess you can really get lost in the temple. If I was a kid, eight to 18, these last few minutes would consist only of a fraction of the seven and a half hours a day that I spend with media. Do I care? Not really. By which I mean of course that there was a fat chance to them. I'm going to stop doing seven and a half hours. That's from a study conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation in 2009 up about an hour and a half from the same study done in 2004. So now in 2012, I think it's safe to say that we're probably pretty close to eight hours. What's the day into nice even thirds, right? Eight hours of the day we sleep eight hours of the day. We consume media like rabbit hungry wolves and eight hours of the day, week, what do we do for the other eight hours of the day?

Speaker 2:          01:24          Yeah, so

Speaker 1:          01:27          what's to be made of all this? I don't want to criticize those who spend a lot of time with media. Clearly your relationship with media, like everything else is your own thing, your own a affair, but I do think that there's something missing from the Kaiser Family Foundation report. See, today's media is social, which means that it consists not only of consumption but also of expression and these two things are relentlessly intertwine. Whatever you consume has been expressed by someone else and whatever you express will be consumed by others. There was a total awareness of this in social media. Facebook and twitter are not journals or diaries. Whatever you post on there is posted with your complete understanding that others will see it and not only see it, but probably will comment on it and thus express themselves for your own response of consumption, and so a facebook status like a novel or a Vlog is a request for judgment.

Speaker 1:          02:14          Any cereal tweeter who tells you that he or she doesn't care what other things should be left at shared expression is the definition of caring what others think. There's such a thing as expression for its own sake, but that's what these are for. The point is that whatever medium of shared expression you choose will be the medium by which you are asking to be judged. If all we're getting from you in terms of expression, is curling up in bed with the salad and a movie until the grammy's start to finally relaxed. Feel so nice gifts. Crack was a little too wet for Whitney Houston. She did work in on a Saturday night, man, I'm to lose work, homemade crab Rangoon, or you have to participate relentlessly in the manifestations of your own blessings. What? Don't be surprised if you're treated equally as simple equally as trey equally as idiotic.

Speaker 1:          02:52          We should never forget or forgo the understanding that expression from a conversation to a feature film is always difficult to do. It well requires a measure of composition of time and a willingness to improve. Despite frustrations. Your social media personality is not you. It's a performance review and maybe for yourself. It's easy not to confuse that difference, but it's not so easy for all those who see only this performance and who are disposed in many ways to treat others as stereotypical as they can and maybe sometimes you get frustrated feeling that others don't understand. You don't see your respect, what you want. Maybe you feel like you're always coming out of conversations or arguments with your point poorly made well, I'll let you in on a secret. Those who can speak well to the point and with lucidity practice these people trip up like everyone else, but less often.

Speaker 1:          03:40          More Times than not, they make their point and come out of even in normal conversation, feeling like you have a better understanding of what they want and who they are. Not everyone is or has to be an artist that everyone has to write a novel or make an album, but there is something to be said for a little bit of reserve when it comes to expression. That way you can preserve some of your own mystery, some of your own subtlety. You can escape some unnecessary judgment and you can recover the power of your own voice. Oh, sorry. Just getting a tweet. What could she possibly be painting?

Speaker 3:          04:19          Cut.
