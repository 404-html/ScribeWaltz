Speaker 1:          00:09          And Mail message from your local nerd writer. Oh, sorry, didn't see you there. Hi, I'm the nerd writer and this week I'm on my 52nd blog. That's a year's worth of logs. So it's sort of a special occasion. So what I'm going to do is a question and answer blog. Now people have asked me a lot of stuff in the comments before and I've never really answered anything outright. So here's your chance. Ask me anything you want in the comments of this video. And next week I'll do a vlog where I answer as many as I can. Also, if you haven't watched my blog from last week a block, 51 New York City, please do and vote for me and my destination dot coms. The biggest, baddest bucket list. If you think it would be cool to see me show you and teach you the world, I think it would be pretty cool. Um, well actually I'd love to stay and talk more, but I have a prior engagement. So ask your questions. I'll see you next time.
