Speaker 1:          00:14          Batman historian, we'll brooker one set the defining characteristic of Gotham city must be there was always correct

Speaker 2:          00:29          night and day. He has only increased police forces, helpless to cope with the situation, but they have an ally. Man.

Speaker 1:          00:37          There has to be crime in Gotham because Batman is on one key level, the one who fights crime. This highlights the inseparable connection between Batman and his city. It's actually more like a circular connection and that one is always creating and perpetuating the other. It was Gotham city that killed Bruce Wayne's parents in the form of a petty thief that it's corrupt. Conditions created sending in motion a chain of events that led to the Batman's obsessive mission to rid them of crime and obsession that fostered a darker and more twisted criminality. I'm an agent of chaos. In the beginning, Gotham was just a backdrop, a setting, and deep. It wasn't even Gotham. It was New York City until detective comics number 48 in the 1943 and 49 television serial's of Batman. Most of the action, largely due to budgets takes place in interiors on sound stages. Little attempt is made to signify Gotham as a whole.

Speaker 1:          01:36          The same is true for the Adam West Batman series in the 19 sixties when the character was at the height of camp scrub through the entire feature length movie from 1966 and you won't see so much as a skyscraper. When the Adam West show failed, Batman writers brought a darker tone to the stories. They brought an extended continuity and continuity meant that individual locations in Gotham gained importance and the city itself started to breathe as a character. This run of dark comics culminated in 1986 with Frank Miller's dark knight returns, which plumbed the obsessive tortured psyche of the Batman and found a counterpoint to that troubled mind in the diseased crime ridden streets of Gotham. That essential feeling was intensified even more and three years later, Gotham city became a nightmare in what has become the most iconic imagining of the caped crusaders home. Tim Burton and Anton first fashioned to city as if hell burst through the pavement and grew drawing from a number of garishly juxtaposed architectural styles and the charcoal drawings of Hugh Ferris.

Speaker 1:          02:47          The creators of 1990 nines, Batman took the eighties fears of worsening crime and augmented them to a kafkaesque love. That aesthetic was made more grand and in Burton's sequel Batman returns, and three years later, a batman forever depicted at Gotham that was flashier, colorful, somehow even more removed from reality. Finally, what was mccobb and genuinely inspired in Burton's imagination became Gadi and genuinely ridiculous in 1997 fourth installment in the series Batman and Robin as monkey business, and yet as the movie's soured, Burton's vision of Gotham television and comics, we're taking all the best parts of the 1989 aesthetic and developing a deeper identity for the city and the Stellar Batman, the animated series. Gotham city is all dark deco, as if the 19 thirties world's fair had gone on for another 60 years in the comics, Batman was more low than ever to leave. Gotham and Gotham itself became more isolated and separated from the rest of the world.

Speaker 1:          03:55          And the famous art called no man's land. The national government chooses to abandoned Gotham entirely after the city is almost destroyed by an earthquake. The island quickly carved up by gangs and villains becomes a hell on earth. Christopher Nolan made a similar isolating move in Batman begins when the police raised the bridges to stop escape criminals from fleeing the city and again in the dark, knight rises, when Bain destroys those bridges. Of course Nolan's Gotham is decidedly more grounded and realistic than its predecessors, especially in the Dark Knight Burton's Gotham may be more nightmarish, but a Gotham that resembles our own world can be even more terrifying when it's shown to be fragile in the face of a violent disregard for the established order from its earliest onscreen depictions in the 19 forties to the latest in a series of gruesome video games and a network tv show that bears its name.

Speaker 1:          04:51          Gotham has been flexible to account for a changing world and a changing Batman. The one constant is crying and irrepressible criminal underclass that plagues the streets with whom the police are either in league or powerless to stop. Indeed, the Batman is by definition unable to stop this scourge to or else his existence would be unjustified. You defending a city, so corrupt, we have infiltrated every level of its infrastructure. Gotham, I think is totally unique in the history of cities real or imagined existing for more than 70 years. We have an exhaustive knowledge of it's attitude of its field of places. They're like Wayne Tower or Arkham asylum on crime, Allie, yet unlike a real city, we can't map it out in the traditional sense and every attempt to do so is subject to change in sort of absurd. Gotham is a city that's performed. We know it by the stories that happened there by the spaces generated from encounters in the night. In this view, it's many versions. Don't register as inconsistencies would cohere into perhaps a new way to think of cities as a site of constant reinvention and varied interpretation as an expression of the traumas that are reenacted by those who have suffered and as a place that can't be mapped by its buildings and streets, but by the events and people and minds that make them
