Speaker 1:          00:09          With all the excitement surrounding the 2008 election, it might be surprising to learn that only 56 point nine percent of eligible citizens a little over half the population, it turned out to vote that year. That's pretty bad, but at least it was a few points better than 2012 and this kind of voter turnout puts us pretty low on the list of developed countries, which is not something to be proud of, but it also means that voter mobilization efforts have the potential to yield massive results. I mean, for example, Romney only lost to Obama by 5 million votes last time. It's a pretty small number compared to the $112 million still up for grabs and get out the vote. Campaigns come in a few different varieties. The most inane and probably the least effective is that kind work. Leonardo Dicaprio in a laundry list of other celebrities command you to vote from the TV.

Speaker 1:          01:00          I mean, seriously, after all this, after this whole video, if you're not going to vote, I don't even know what the sad anymore. Wow. Leo, that really hurts even self-aware and comedic campaigns in this vein, like the one just Sweden made earlier this year like lead, don't move the needle all that much because they rely on old fashioned techniques, namely a handful of righteous messages that include things like it's your responsibility to vote for your voice, won't be heard otherwise, or it's historic and slash or really, really close election. The while, these are all really good reasons to vote. They all operate under the assumption of a behavioral theory called rational self interest for decades and decades. People assume that if social norms about voting, we're heavily reinforced like they are in those ads, then people would just comply to satisfy their sense of civic duty. Unfortunately, when put to the test, these techniques came up way short than a landmark.

Speaker 1:          01:54          Two thousand eight paper from Gerber Green and larimer extensive studies found that theories based on rational self interested behavior generally fail to predict significant turnout. This goes for celebrities talking to you through the TV or online, as well as phone banks, direct mail, or door to door canvasing. The problem is that plenty of people tell you they're going to vote, but don't actually do so when the time comes, but behavioral research can offer us some tricks to help study show for example, that if you ask people about their specific plan, ask them where they're voting or how they're going to get there. You could double or triple your effectiveness. Also, campaigners often tell people that every vote counts more when there's a low turnout, so their vote is extra important, but the research shows that people are more likely to vote if they think there's going to be a high turnout.

Speaker 1:          02:42          In other words, if everyone else is doing it too. Okay, but what if you really wanted to boost the vote? Is there anything that would motivate people in a really big way? Well, let's go back to that paper from Gerber Green and Larabar because I think it's really fascinating what they did. They basically conducted a large scale field experiment where they mailed out letters to four different groups of people. The first was a standard campaign mailer that said, do your civic duty vote basically like those commercials who were looking at the second inform people that they would be confidentially studying voter turnout for the election. Now, let me just pause here to say something that you may not know in America, everyone's voting record. It's public. Now, don't freak out because you can't find out who people voted for, only if they voted or not. In fact, in the third meal or the researchers did just that they mailed people their own voting record from the past two elections.

Speaker 1:          03:40          Looks like Robert Wayne wasn't able to make it out there in 2004 and the fourth mailer, and this is where it gets really interesting, takes it one step further. Not only did they send out people's voting records, but they also included the voting records of their neighbor so that everyone could see who voted and who didn't. Now, while the turnout of the first group, the group who got the regular mailer raised, one point eight percentage points, turnout in the last group increased by eight point one percentage points, which is a huge increase and it makes sense. I wouldn't want to be the only one on my block who didn't vote. Now I'm not saying this is the right thing to do. It's probably not, but imagine if facebook told you that it was instituting a flair on your avatar after the election based on the public record that simply said, voted something that you didn't have to put up if you didn't want to, but couldn't put up if you didn't vote or imagine if it just put a big didn't vote after someone's saying, I bet you'd see a pretty significant increase in voting across the board.

Speaker 1:          04:44          Now I realized that shaming people is probably not the best motivator and researchers found that this method did receive a fair amount of backlash, but it is interesting to think about voter participation is something that concerns all of us because only about half of Americans vote every four years and far fewer at local elections in between. I mean, just imagine if the over 100 million people who don't vote could be motivated to do so. The political landscape that everyone seems to be so tired of could be totally transformed, but you know, don't take it from me. I mean, seriously, after all this, after this whole video, if you're not going to run, I don't even know what to say to you anymore.

Speaker 2:          05:26          There is a new nerve writer video every Wednesdays. Be in that box right there. You know what? Forget about this. Can you see it as Florence, Italy and it's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. I'm here with my parents today, Hon. sorry. The videos had been late. I just spent so much here to Italy. It's been so amazing. Anyway, I have to think squarespace for sponsoring this video that makes leak intuitive websites. Um, you sign up for a year, you get a free domain name@squarespace.com.
