Speaker 1:          00:00          Oh,

Speaker 2:          00:01          Yay.

Speaker 1:          00:04          Coffee on a Tuesday in block 15. Hello to everybody who is new speaking for the 500 who were here before and myself. Welcome to or generosity during the project for awesome. Expanded my conception of what could be done in this community. And though it's not enough, clearly I can only say thank you. Oh, window.

Speaker 3:          00:38          Okay,

Speaker 4:          00:44          so now that that's done, I think the president wanted to say something. My fellow Americans major combat operations in Iraq. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

Speaker 1:          00:52          No, no, not that bright. So as your commander in chief on behalf of a grateful nation, I'm proud to finally say these two words and I know your family's agree.

Speaker 1:          01:08          Welcome home. Yes, yes, yes, yes. The Warner rack is over December 15th, 2011, eight years and 270 days later, but he's early as 2004. I think the worse thing about a smart to most as deliberately putting your hand on a sizzling pam, we have to be careful about simplifying a complex decade because it will be left to us nine years later to appraise this, tell a story in a way which is loyal to the truth, but also answerable to the 4,000, 487 troops who gave their lives to it and the many more thousands who gave their arms or their legs or their ability to use either, but that I am not going to talk about the war proper. What I want to talk about is what happens when you burn your fingers on a sizzling pan. If it's happened to you, then you know that if it's a good solid burn that some of your skin is gonna.

Speaker 1:          01:47          Stay on that path and his troops. Levi records a bit of our collective skin which will stay in that country for some time or roughly 16,000 Americans still in Iraq to aid with the ongoing diplomatic effort there and effort which is primarily aimed at making sure we secure and alliance with the young democratic government. We worked so hard and spent so much to put in place is particularly important because it sits on the largest oil reserves in the world according to new seismic data and with so much uncertainty in the region because of the Arab spring. Iraq remains a very strategic allies, so the $16,000 split up like this. 2,000 diplomats and 14,000 civilian contractors are. Those contractors are there for general light support. Everything from transportation to food service at mess hall and the other half are security contractors. I want to talk about the ladder security contractors because you hear that term tossed around a lot, but I think a lot of people don't really know what it means. I did the official name for the entity is private military company or PMC though many know them as security contractors or even mercenary, so they don't really like that last.

Speaker 3:          02:46          Maybe, maybe you

Speaker 1:          02:50          can see what whatever you want to call them. They are corporations that deal in the peripheral duties of war for profit. They can't engage in offensive operations according to the Geneva Convention that they can do almost everything but including defensive operations with a liberal use of the term defense. They build planes, maintain them, even fly them in conflict zones. They supply bodyguards for diplomatic construct, bass military camps, operate intelligence systems, supply weapons and ammunition, and they trained soldiers. In fact, most security contractors are retired soldiers, men and women who come out of combat with a set of skills applicable nowhere else, but income that contract companies will pay them generously for those skills, often more than double what the army pay. It's no skin off their back because the private military industry has boomed in the last 10 years, really ever since 1991. When the Pentagon led, by then defense secretary, Dick Cheney paid a company called Brown and Root Services eight point $5,000,000,000 to study the use of private military forces with soldiers in combat zone.

Speaker 1:          03:41          Now, brandon and services was a subsidiary of Halliburton oil company where Cheney served as ceo between his time as defense secretary and vice president. He's studied film that outsourcing duties to private military companies was cheap, so after nine slash 11 when the Bush administration announced its war on terror, the role of pmcs was increased dramatically during combat operations in Iraq. Tens of thousands of security contractor supplied necessary goods and services to the troops as they toppled Saddam's regime. And when the invasion ended and the occupation began, contractors only grew in number. The government was outsourcing its responsibilities to the point of confusion. April 2004 for contractors from a company called Blackwater were killed, burned, and dragged through the streets of Fallujah and central Iran. This footage was released to the news outlets and it prompted a revenge mission to recapture the city Operation Vigilante resolved in which 27 Americans were killed.

Speaker 1:          04:29          One hundred 80 and surgeons and 600 Iraqi civilians, you see security contractors don't have access to all the tactical information that the troops have, yet still, they carry guns and operate within all the same theaters of conflict. They don't fall into the chain of command so they can leave anytime they want to get multimillion dollar contracts with the State Department, but being private companies, they don't have to provide itemized records of where the money is going. Perhaps the most troubling thing of all about plcs is that they don't fall under the uniform code of military justice. That lack of accountability, that lack of oversight, which alarms many, the questionable deaths of dozens of Iraqis which will never be prosecuted as the war ends. The contractors will stay indefinitely to provide security for the embassy in Baghdad, Iraq and Bosnia. The last being a city 20 miles from the border of Iran and sitting on one of the largest oil fields in the world. Yes, oil, sexy, delicious, scrumptious. If I ran seizes, control of it in one way or another weekend, see gas prices rise to five, six, seven, $10. Again, I think it's fair to say that the only reason we went to Iraq was for the oil, but there's no doubt that in large part and with the help of pmcs it's why we're staying.

Speaker 3:          05:44          No.

Speaker 1:          05:48          Hello everybody and welcome to the special ed message. I got some news.
