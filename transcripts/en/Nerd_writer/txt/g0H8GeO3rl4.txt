Speaker 1:          00:04          One of the great overlooked pop songs of 2016 was drake's feel, no ways of his April release views, I think overlooked because in terms of radio play, I think the song was lost in the shadow of one dance and controller to dancehall and few singles that dominated the grip. Sonia from way back when you know that I don't play, which is a shame because I feel no ways I think is just as good, if not better than those songs and more than that, it tells an interesting story about Drake's place at the center of Popular Music in 2016. Now I want to spend most of my time discussing the production here, but lyrically we should note that feel no ways treads over some familiar territory. He's lamenting the end of a relationship that he's had to cut short because it was holding him back. Personally. This is drake and full emotional pop.

Speaker 1:          00:51          Now some people come to drake for rap. Others come to him for RNB inflicted pop like this, but most of us love him and his music for the bridge that he navigates. Between those two things. A bridge that was really first explored in a big way by Kanye west on his hugely influential album, eight weeks in Hartland gene may cause within this 80 style electro r and b that young drake found a lane for himself to dominate and perfect. A drake himself cited Kanye as an inspiration and drake's longtime producer and collaborator, no afford 40 should be described as one of the early Eureka moment. The experience of hearing drake rap over Kanye say you will the first track from eight. Wait, why do I feel so alone? Like everybody passes out the role. I tried seven years later, drake and 40 have shifted the pop focus into their own center of gravity.

Speaker 1:          01:49          This Toronto Cold Edis Electro R and B rap pop hybrid that you hear everywhere, most notably in the musician straight has signed his own record label. October is very unsound or ops, the producer from one of those extraordinary omen from Majid Jordan and rnb duo composed feel no ways and it's sort of the perfect distillation of the sounds and moods that we've been talking about. Don't feel no ways is made up. Essentially have three parts, Greg's voice, a break beat drum patterns and an electric piano that plays a simple but catchy chord progression that goes like this, c major seven, g major seven and a minor seven with a few little flourishes here and there. This progression pretty much loops for the entire song, but what's more significant than the courts are the sounds that omen selected for the song. The synth being used here is the famous Yamaha dx seven, which was only made between the years of 1983 and 1989. The dx seven is one of the most commercially successful synthesizers of all time. It came equipped with 30 odd factory meant to emulate different instruments. Now, in theory, you could program more sounds in addition to this, but the interface was so notoriously confusing that most people stuck to the presets and as a result, a whole decade of music became infused and associated with these instantly recognizable. Sounds to the point of cliche

Speaker 1:          03:34          considering how tacky the dxf and sounded by the end of the eighties, it's amazing how draken omen reappropriate it for this driving upbeat pop song. In 2016, of course it wasn't sound as fresh by itself and that's why I think the true cleverness here is how omen pairs this reality. DX seven, emulation of a fender Rhodes piano with another classic Edis Element, a drum sample from the very origins of hip hop. This breakbeat comes from an absolutely incredible album called scratch him, which is an early hip hop record from 1983 put together by maybe the most unlikely guy. Imagine that's Malcolm Mclaren, a British impresario who helped launch the punk movement in the UK by founding the sex pistols in 1975 in the eighties. He went solo and released an album called duck rock under his own name, which brought together African music and American hip hop, helping to popularize the sound and America and exported around the world on duck rock and dlx scratching. Mclaren collaborated with Djs from one of the earliest and best hip hop radio shows. The world's famous supreme team, which aired at 4:00 AM on the east coast for an hour. Omen brilliantly pulled the beat from their song, world's famous and put the DJ's own voices and the breakdown

Speaker 2:          05:07          because way

Speaker 1:          05:14          two main elements pulls from both sides of drake's musical aesthetic, eighties R and B and hip hop and fuses them under his voice which pops out of the instrumentation like cold water. I tried to sleep in the song is the perfect encapsulation of the pop music that drake and his team have defined in the last few years. A kind of music that feeds its influences within the elements that make it up. Of course eventually pop music, we'll move on. The style will change. Someone new will move to the center, but it's good to appreciate the moment we're in while we're in it, especially in those rare times when the most popular
