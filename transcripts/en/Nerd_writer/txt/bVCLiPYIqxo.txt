Speaker 1:          00:02          Okay, here's an interesting story. An amendment was made to the clean air act in the United States, aimed at reducing the release of carbon monoxide into the atmosphere to reduce air pollution. Part of the law mandated that gasoline and automobiles must have a minimum amount of oxygen at additive. A chemical compound that helps fuel burn more completely in this limits the certain carbon monoxide released into the atmosphere from 1992 to 2005. The most popular oxidative for gasoline was methyl, ethyl, ether or Mtbe, but in the early two thousands, the number of cases of mtbe contaminating groundwater raised concerns about its health effects. Gasoline additive mtbe was first noticed in the water in 2000. One residential reportedly got sick from drinking it, 2004, both New York and California banned that chemical from the state. A big blow considering Kelly and and why accounted for 40 percent of nationwide mtbe consumption.

Speaker 1:          00:58          A year later in 2005, 23 more states followed suit and band that chemical. In that same year, Congress passed the Energy Policy Act, which did not include provisions to shield MTB manufacturers from those pesky water contamination lawsuits, and so with no protections against growing public outcry, the country was forced to turn to alternative ways of gasoline oxygenation. What filled the void was ethanol in the last 10 years, ethanol manufacturer and consumption has risen like a rocket ship in 2010. The US was the world's top ethanol producer with 13 point 2 billion gallons or 57 point five percent of global production. Ethanol is a biofuel, which means that it's a fuel produced from living organisms. In the case of America, the majority of ethanol comes from corn. The increase of demand for ethanol driven in part by US legislation to reduce air pollution has led to the widespread expansion of crop land to produce more corn, especially in the Midwest and Great Plains right smack Dab in the middle of the monarch butterfly migration path.

Speaker 1:          02:05          Whoa. The butterflies dude, indigenous to North America and instantly recognizable to anyone who lives here. The monarch butterfly, it makes the longest and most spectacular migration of any insect in the world. Every winter the monarch population flies 2,500 miles from its many homes in America and Canada to specific warm sites in Mexico and Southern California on the way it lays eggs for the next generation, but it can only lay them in one place. Milkweed plant. It's an odd feature of nature that monarch larva eat milkweed leaves and nothing else, but they do and as much as monarch larva. Love that. Milkweed farmers hate it. It's a week we'd reduce yield and less yield means less money. So in addition to clearing pristine lands in the great plains where milkweed thrives, farmers have increasingly adopted genetically modified crops which are resistant to herbicides like roundup. To introduce you to round up quick pro.

Speaker 1:          03:01          This product is produced by Monsanto. It is a post emergent nonselective herbicide. Naturally, this poses a serious danger to the population of the monarch butterfly, which has fallen a mindblowing 90 percent since its peak in 1996. The losses of milkweed are only part of the reason why the monarch population is crashing, illegal deforestation of their winter home in Mexico and a couple of years of bad weather have hurt their ability to make the long journey south and north again, but even when conditions are right, monarchs now have to fly farther and longer to find places to lay their eggs. Often they die before making it there. No one is talking about the extinction of the monarch just yet, but a 56 percent loss of monarch population in one year, 2013 is nothing to sneeze at. Both America and Mexico have pledged to do what's necessary to save the monarch, and if you want to help, you can learn how to build butterfly gardens in your backyard. I don't know about you, but to me this is an amazing story. A story of the unintended consequences of human action on earth. Legislation passed in the US years ago to fight pollution has come to pose a serious longterm threat to one of nature's loveliest creatures. It's certainly a cliche to say everything in nature is connected,

Speaker 2:          04:17          but it is.
