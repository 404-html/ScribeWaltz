Speaker 2:          00:06          I think we can all agree that political corruption is a bad thing and you don't get more black and white in this regard. In the case of former Virginia Governor Bob Mcdonnell, former Republican governor of Virginia bobbing, Donald has an Alvin sentenced to two years in prison, 24 months. That is how long Bob Mcdonald will spend in jail for corruption charges. Last year at Mcdonald was convicted of accepting gifts from a donor in exchange for political favors. This kind of personal corruption, quid pro quo stuff is what we're used to seeing on television and in film put simply, we don't want those in power. Our elected leaders to take ethical shortcuts and we shouldn't, but our defenses are fragile. If personal corruption is the only kind we recognize and protect ourselves against. Unfortunately, this is exactly the case in the United States. A little over five years ago, the Supreme Court in the landmark decision of citizens united versus fec took up the argument against structural corruption and what happens when the political system itself is dependent on money from private interests and found it. Last week, the Supreme Court reversed a century of law that I believe will open the floodgates for special one.

Speaker 2:          01:29          The majority decided that political donations from how ever large and entity or protected as a form of free speech, but does this misunderstand the way politics actually works. Though there is no explicit promise of legislative favors for campaign donors, politicians remain indebted to their wealthiest benefactors and this that weaves its way into policy decisions that considered the needs of private interests over those of the common. Now, the key argument against regulating this kind of structural corruption is that it's hard to determine where free speech ends and political corruption begins and that it may not be the court's placed to draw that line. The premise is freedom of speech, the more speech the bed, but my only recognizing something for something personal corruption. The courts actually do draw a line and abdicate themselves from the complex interplay of money and politics, and I guess most people who accused American politics of being corrupt, do so because they see an essential unfairness in the system reflected in vast economic inequality.

Speaker 2:          02:36          That's getting worse, not better. As time goes on, when the power of a political campaign comes down to the size of its coffers, it's easy to see how moneyed interests retaining an improper advantage and when that advantage serves to worsen existing inequalities in the system, such politics are, at least in part structurally corrupt, worst of all, structural corruption more than personal corruption perpetuates the idea that individual people don't have a voice in politics. That putting the needs of the Commonwealth first is impossible and so it's pointless to try. Ironically, this kind of collective action diminished by the free speech of wealthy special interests is the only way to protect democracy from the corrupting influences at it.
