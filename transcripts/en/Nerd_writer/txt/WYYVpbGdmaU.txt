Speaker 1:          00:05          I can't quite believe that three years ago I began my life as a youtuber with this video explaining that I had become disillusioned with filmmaking, my major at school, and wanted to become a novelist. The plan back then was to follow the example of John Green, who is just then finishing the fault in our stars because morning it's Monday. The vlogs purpose was to find an audience for a novel I had written while living in Paris and hoped at some point to publish. A couple of weeks later, I came up with the name. Here's my thinking. I'm an editor and a writer and they're fighting writer, a nerd writer these days. Youtube is like the wild west of media, and even the ones who've made it can't quite conceive of their profession because whenever they started doing what they're doing, it didn't exist. At least that's been the experience for me.

Speaker 1:          00:52          Early on. I knew that what I was doing here as the nerd writer was more exciting and fulfilling than any other work in my life, but exactly what it was alluded. So today, now, three years later, I want to update the mission statement of this project. What we do here besides talk with our hands a lot, is cultivate worldview. I think those two words sum it up nicely. Worldview is, as you know, a particular philosophy of life. It implies the entirety of what we comprehend and believe about the world, about ourselves, about how each interacts with the other. It suggests a commitment, a modest one to the well rounded individual, the intellectual life we at the nerd writer are men and women of letters. As Taran said, nothing human is foreign to us. We recognize that life is philosophical, moral, political, financial, psychological, artistic, scientific, and that what is worth knowing is worth weaving into a complex and comprehensive web.

Speaker 1:          01:51          That's what goes on here at the nerd writer and it's a process that takes time. I researched right film and edit this project by myself and the free time I have after working a full time day job, but my dream is to do this with you full time. I've set up an account on Patrion.com and today I'm asking for your help to keep this project going. If you don't know what Patrion is, it's a really cool way for fans to become patrons of the content they love. The way it works is like this. When you become a patron of an artist, you're agreeing to give that artist a tip. Every time they release a piece of content. For the nerd writer, what you can expect is three to four videos a month, maximum four, so if you pledge $1, say that means you're going to be spending somewhere between three to $4 a month.

Speaker 1:          02:35          It's important to note that the nerd writer will always be free. You will always be able to access this channel and the videos here without charge. This is just for people who have the ability and the desire to help support this channel. I don't want anyone stretching their budgets if they can't afford it. For those of you who donate $1, you'll get a text mention at the end of all my following videos. For those of you who donate $3, you'll get a personal type written poem by me sent to your house. For those of you who donate $5, and this is by far my favorite. You can get a limited edition nerd writer Mug at matches the Mug logo at the beginning of my videos or other perk ideas. I want to know what you think they're for you. So I think she'd probably have a say in what they are giving me suggestions in the comments here at the nerd writer. We think and speak critically dispassionately, precisely as we can. We try to see the world and ourselves for what they are. We try to think about how we would like them to be and why it is we would like them to be that way and we think about thinking to hear we cultivate worldview and have had a fucking good time doing it. So thank you. And coffee on a Tuesday.
