Speaker 1:          00:07          Nights ago, my girlfriend and I had a couple drinks and convinced ourselves that we needed to go down the street to bonds for snacks. We ended up with a sort of weird grouping of six items, toasted sesame water crackers, some smoked mozzarella cheese chick pea chips, it dozen eggs because you always need eggs. This sweet young coconut, because I saw it near the cash register and scallions because honey, why don't we get scallions again? I have no idea. Well, apparently nobody knows why. We got the scallions. Anyway, we enjoyed the snacks. They were all really good, but then I happened to look at the check and I realized that I had accidentally paid for 17 federal programs. Not exactly, but let me explain. This year, the federal budget requests for the corporation for public broadcasting. The organization that runs pbs, NPR and over 1400 locally owned public radio and television stations is $445,000,000 using the latest census information that comes out to a dollar and thirty seven cents per American per year or about the cost of 12 and a half toasted sesame water crackers.

Speaker 1:          01:19          The National Endowment for the arts, once a budget of only $150 million to help fund our exhibitions and our education across the country to help America imagine itself artistically. Each of us has to pay just this much smoked mozzarella cheese per year. You might be wondering why I'm bringing all this up. It's because in the next few weeks, you're likely to see the trump administration proposed dramatic budget cuts to the federal government that will seek to prioritize the corporation for public broadcasting and eliminate the national endowment of the arts completely as well as 15 other programs. Thanks to some good work from Taylor temper over at Time magazine. We know that taken together, these 17 programs will cost every American $22 and thirty six cents per year. The exact cost of my late night snack run. Here's what they'll each costs you individually and what they do. Cue The montage music. The National Endowment for the humanities helps fund museums, colleges, libraries, and things like Ken Burns.

Speaker 1:          02:17          Awesome civil war documentary. It'll cost you the price of just one egg in the minority business development agency promotes the growth of businesses owned and operated by minority entrepreneurs. It costs everyone just eleven cents or this many chopped scallions. You can fund the Economic Development Administration and organization that supplies regional and local businesses with the infrastructure they need to compete in the global market for 20 percent of the water in this coconut for the cost of six water crackers with cheese, you can support the international trade administration, which helps enforce trade law for US companies for 20 percent of one bag of chick pea chips. You'll fund the manufacturing extension partnership, which is dedicated to small and medium sized manufacturers. For 17 percent more chicken chips. You'll fund the office of violence against women, which oversees programs across the country that reduce domestic violence and sexual assault. The Legal Services Corporation helps poor Americans afford legal services.

Speaker 1:          03:16          That'll cost you just three eggs, fried plus some scallions. The civil rights division of the Justice Department fights discrimination and protects voting rights. That'll cost you just a couple shots of coconut water, plus some scallions to fund the UN intergovernmental panel on climate change, which compiles the latest scientific data on global warming. You have to throw in just this much of a chick pea chip you office of electricity, deliverability and energy reliability invests in making our energy grid more stable and secure. It costs all the scallions. The scallions are really cheap, and finally the office of energy efficiency and renewable energy aids efforts to transition America to a clean energy economy. It's the most expensive of the bunch you get. It only cost the price of one box of water crackers and one bag of chips. The blueprint for these cuts comes from a paper put out by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank that has long argued for eliminating federal programs as a way to reduce our $20,000,000,000,000 national debt.

Speaker 1:          04:13          But the problem is that altogether these programs are asking for only seven point $3,000,000,000, which is one percent of the non defense discretionary spending that our government does. Fully half of discretionary spending goes to the military. Something that the trump administration is not likely to slash all that much, and in total, all discretionary spending makes up only 31 percent of the federal budget. The rest goes to social security. Medicare, Medicaid entitlements that trump has also vowed not to touch. In other words, privatizing or eliminating b 17 programs is really only a symbolic gesture that won't do much of anything. The good news is that this is a fight that should be pretty easy to win. If you're willing to spend drunkenly or not. Twenty $2 and thirty six cents on these 17 programs, call your congressman and say so, and if they want to know why you think privatizing pbs or killing the National Endowment of the arts is a bunch of bullshit, feel free to send them this video.
