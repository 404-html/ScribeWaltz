Speaker 1:          00:20          Anyone familiar with the work of director? David Cronenberg knows that he has an intense fascination with bodies, physical bodies, bodies transformed or bodies mutilated, bodies dripping or bodies explode, so it's no surprise that his film, eastern promises opens with a focus on three bodies, the sliced body of a Chechen gangster, the wounded expiring body of a pregnant prostitute, and the fragile small body of that woman's infant who is soaked in her blood. It will eventually become clear that these three bodies are connected by the films narrative. A point that is made explicit early on by one character's poor grasp of English barrier secrets was her body's indeed. It is a central theme of Cronenberg that body's only exist within a continuum of other bodies to which they are connected and from which they gain meaning. For Cronenberg, the body is representative of the individual, perhaps even more so than the mind, despite the fact that we're mental creatures conceiving of things in abstraction, we are irrevocably tied to the physical organism that's given to us and much of our anxiety about aging or disease or deformity is directed toward the body in eastern promises.

Speaker 1:          01:44          The physical reality of the body is examined in the context of the equally physical reality of collective violence, of which bodies are it's perpetrators and victims. A Cronenberg only has a few scenes that actually show that violence, I think five in total, but their presence saturates the rest of the film and you're lingering memories of it, but take the very first scene, the throat slitting, the way it's filmed. You're not allowed any distance from the action. You're right, they're your own neck. Feels sensitive. Your own hand feels like it's holding the knife. Cronenberg is a genius at placing the audience in the middle of body on body clashes like this one. The violence is literally embodied by the viewer, but before I get too far ahead of myself, eastern promises tells the story of the expatriate Russian mafia in London and the ripples that run through it. When a midwife played by Naomi Watts uncovers a diary with potentially damaging evidence against the family.

Speaker 1:          02:44          Connected to this is the story of Nikolai played expertly by Viggo Mortensen, a driver slash thug who's ruthlessness, judgment and efficiency propels him up the ranks of the crime organization. That organization and the Russian crime world in general is evidenced on individual members by tattoos that tell the story of their lives and their rank, emphasizing the real bodily relationship between individuals and the group, and I have tattoos. You don't exist as well as a captain. This body, this corpse who the audience knows was professionally processed by Nikolai earlier in the film, sets up an interesting contrast because of that processing. The police can't identify the individual, only that individual's rank and history of crime, and here's an example of how individuality is sacrificed to the collective. Most groups and especially those that use violence as a means organized themselves around some kind of common ideal, some code or traditional escalate God says, never speak to anybody about you'll get sane individuals.

Speaker 1:          03:52          It's often hypothesize, need a shared code like this to commit acts of cruelty because in a group those acts can be attributed to the collective and it's goals and the individual doesn't have to face responsibility or individuality is that I think this makes for a paradox and the problem or the paradox is that collectives often ask people to relinquish individuality, but the thing that defines individuality and identity for so many people is their place within a collective. More on that in a moment. The problem is that once a person sacrifices part of his or her individuality to the group, the group can then sacrifice the individual Tatiana, the pregnant woman from the beginning of the film, who's voiceover diary entries, hang like a specter over everything that happens left Russia to find a better life in the multicultural collective of London, but she was absorbed into a vicious subgroup of that collective that sacrificed her individuality for its own ends.

Speaker 1:          04:54          Anna, the midwife wants to connect with her Russian heritage, but she too brings herself within the orbit of the Mafia. Escaping. We're Tatiana could not. The head of the mafia son played by Vincent Cassel is genetically linked to his fucking birthmark, which means he has to sacrifice his homosexuality, his individual truth to an organization and a culture that rejects such a lifestyle at the risk of being ostracized or worse. It's worth noting, of course, that Cronenberg uses this case to highlight the way men use their bodies to project masculinity real or fake. Of course, the major case study here is that Nikolai Nikolai sacrifices himself to the Russian mafia, made perfectly clear by the way he prefers his naked body to the group and the ritual almost eroticize scene in which he earns the star tattoos almost immediately after this. He learns the cost of that sacrifice when he is betrayed.

Speaker 1:          06:00          This isn't only one of the best scenes in film history, beautifully choreographed, filmed, but it's the scene that brings all of Cronenberg's themes to a climax. This matrix of individual collective body and violence. Individuals subsumed in groups like the Russian mafia or in a strange kind of crisis. The group doesn't so much demand the disillusion of individuality, but rather the maintenance of individuality that's always united with the group's intentions. It's easy to see how paradoxical that is. How can individuals define themselves by connection to an organization that makes them interchangeable in the bathhouse seen, the Russian mob uses this interchangeability to betray Nicholi, letting the Chechens identify him as someone else by his tattoos. Of course, the tattoos or a form of body manipulation that individuals like Nicole, I use to code this paradoxical identity into reality to make it real. A Cronenberg and Mortenson have Nikolai fight naked in order to show that by joining this group, it's not only individuality that's made vulnerable, but the body itself and when it's revealed.

Speaker 1:          07:08          Finally, that Nikolai is actually an undercover agent. It's these cuts and bruises that prove his devotion to another kind of collective, the police and realize his identity as a hero who uses the rules of individuals and groups to his own advantage. Cronenberg is a master filmmaker because he can use the elements of a crime genre film written by someone else to interrogate these big themes. Human beings are individuals in collectives, they our minds and bodies, they operate within ideas where blood is symbolic, just a color or a bouquet of roses and yet live in the physical world where blood can send you to jail or be the last thing you ever see. Among these themes are paradoxes that we can't resolve, but our body's exposed the truth that David Cronenberg wants us to remember that we are all the victims and the perpetrators of reality.

I think this is just a great example of an amazing director elevating a genre movie to become something more than that by, by the power of his directing, what he chooses to focus on and the themes that he laces through it. So I love Cronenberg. I might analyze more of his movies. I don't know, but this is a fantastic one. I think I. let me go Mortenson, so I will. I'll see you guys next Wednesday.
