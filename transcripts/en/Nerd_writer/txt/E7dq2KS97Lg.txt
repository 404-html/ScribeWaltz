Speaker 1:          00:00          Well, it's good to be back on schedule coffee on of Tuesday and Vlog 47.

Speaker 2:          00:16          Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:16          so I'm tired of people trying to cash in on my childhood hogs, crazy bones, yoyos pokemon cards. The TV shows that B, which just the commercials we sat through, the movies that changed our lives. These things are strong into my heart with a special tautness sensitive so that every cheap tug can make me feel something like, but not quite genuine emotion. Maybe you've seen the recently released ad for Internet explorer called child of the nineties. I can't show it for copyright reasons, but I've put a link in the description if you want to watch it. Essentially the ad is a collection of those fads and items from the childhood years of my generation, nothing more certainly, and I don't know if you could do anything less. It's a terrible ad that plays cheaply on a single emotion, not unlike those hard commercials for Spca that show watery eye dogs to the music of Sarah Mclaughlin.

Speaker 1:          01:10          Excuse me. Whereas the SPCA, commercial exploits are natural sympathy and pity, poorly for a good cause. The Internet explorer add exploits our nostalgia for the loan cause of profit. Now, of course, the exploitation of human emotion for profit is what makes the entire industry of advertising despicable and reprehensible, but as we are hardly any of us unconnected to it, now we speak hypocritically when we vilify it, though I've always contended citing my hypocritical vilification that it can never be art with a capital, a advertising edits very best can be so art full, so nuanced and spectacular that it becomes a hotbed of original creative ideas from which artists of every medium can steal and use to their advantage at its worst. Advertising Cherry picks easy sentiments and paying them over and over again until we're all suffering from blunt force emotional trauma. We'd been watching ads for a long time.

Speaker 1:          02:03          We know these things. The difference and nothing makes this more clear than the child of the nineties at is that now we. My generation is the target. Now we're working in TV like I do. You hear that term tossed around a lot. The demo. How did we do in the demo? Are we performing well in the demo? The ratings weren't great, but it's okay because the demo was good. Demo is of course short for demographic, just a particular section of the population, but when people say the demo, they're talking about a very specific group. They're talking about people from the ages of 18 to 49. These are the golden geese. The people to whom the gross majority of advertising and commercial entertainment is ain't. Why? Well, because we have the money with the invention of people meters in the early eighties. Advertisers could see not only what people were watching but who was watching what in the early 19 seventies, ABC, the last place network, unable to pull in a wide swath and audience sold what had which was younger viewers and the demo was born.

Speaker 1:          03:02          Total viewing numbers matter less than performance in the demo. A good example of this is the simpsons is a show that routinely ranked somewhere in the sixties of the most watched shows, but the average viewer of the simpsons is 29 years old and that means that the simpsons can charge more per commercial than many of the highest rank show. It's all predicated on the notion that young people, young professionals like me, have disposable income, that we're more likely to spend than older people. Not only that, we're more likely to find brands now that will stick with for a lifetime. We have the money. Advertisers want the money and TV shows. One, the advertisers. These are deeply ingrained relationships, determining much of what you see and our soul. We've passed into the black heart of the demo now and that means that everything is up for grabs, including and especially our memory knickknacks from the nineties when life wasn't so terribly depressed by the idea of rent forever, when social media didn't exist, when life was homework and home cooked meals and everything. Now, when these things in their own time giveaway to the new more complicated and meaningless things of the future, it will all be used and every sensitive heartstring will be pulled and the generous rosie, Britta filter of memory will be exploited so that the perfect time of then will unfold before our eyes in glorious escape. And the only way back there is to download the newest version of Internet explorer.

Speaker 1:          04:35          Hey everybody, thanks for watching. I wanted to remind you to follow me on Tumbler. I love tomorrow. Now. It was just a great place to put the images and things that inspire me all in one place. Also, I am getting better at twitter, sort of learning how to communicate interestingly on that site. Um, so follow me at the nerd writer. Both those things are in the description and I will see you next time.
