Speaker 1:          00:00          Goodbye Philadelphia and goodbye family. Hello coffee on a Tuesday in hd. Well, so last week, 48 civilian protesters were killed in Tahrir Square Cairo in Egypt. Two thousand nine months ago. The square looked like this. So what happened? Maybe you know the story of ancient Egypt. Maybe Mr Greg spent three whole weeks on it in fifth grade and you learned about Pharaohs and Hieroglyphics and pyramids, which you later made for a project out of foam board or cardboard or sugar cubes or cheats at the very least. You know

Speaker 2:          00:51          a young man, he never thought in people's standard feed the boy

Speaker 1:          00:59          and maybe you thought all that was fascinated with the story of modern Egypt is just as incredible and it's so much at the heart of the cultural shift happening in the Middle East right now that we ought to get an idea of how it goes. Well, it goes like this. The man looks and Egyptian military cask held power in Egypt from 1250 to 1517 when the Turks, the Ottoman Empire bitch him out and took control and he kept it until 1798 when Napoleon bitched them. And finally in 18, oh, one napoleon himself was bitched by the Brits. The Brits were only there because the French war, so when the French were expelled, the Brits left to eating a vacuum of power, which the Turks and the mamluks jumped to fill. In the end, it was neither work nor Mamluk who seize control, but rather an Albanian commander who played the two against each other called Mohammed Ali.

Speaker 1:          01:46          No, not that one or that one. That one here is the beginning of modern Egypt. 18 Ali began reforming the country into a modern state building. It's military, it's industry, and it's educated bureaucracy basically from scratch it more than any man ever had for Egypt, single handedly sparking the Arab renaissance or the Alda. He won some battles and gain some territory and lost some battles and lost some territory. He got older, he got paranoid. He went crazy and he died. His son assuming power. Then he died shortly after his nephew assumed power and he was killed in his fourth son. Then his grandson and his great grandson, lesser men. By the 18 eighties, Egypt had become completely dependent on England and France for a healthy economy and when they tried to break away England, sent in its forces and occupied the country, state under occupation until after the first world war.

Speaker 1:          02:32          When the war party led by sod, so cool. Ask for independence from Britain, something they thought they had been promised for their sacrifice in the war. They exiled to go to Malta, and this sparked a grassroots uprising, the revolution of 1919. The result of this was the official independence of Egypt in 1992 and the drafting of the Constitution a year later, but their independence was largely in. The agent was now a monarchy with a king backed by the British and subservient to the British Consulate, Jim. He died before World War Two and was replaced with 16 year old King Farouk. The. This guy was a British puppet. The Brits used Egypt as a base of allied operations all throughout World War II propaganda from Germany, the Soviet Union and the United States all added to anti British. Sent them in 1948 Egypt blunder through the Arab Israeli war, losing 78 percent of Palestine and the process the country blamed you guessed it for the movement called the Free Officers led by Mohammed the grief and the mall.

Speaker 1:          03:29          Nasir orchestrated a military coup in 1952, Egypt's second 20th century revolution. They overthrew for root tossed away the 1923 constitution and declared Egypt a Repub, setting up a one party system made of all three officers called the liberation route. Now Gleam was declared, the first president of Uja drafted a new constitution, a secular in nature, which a group called the Muslim Brotherhood apoe. Two years later, the Muslim Brotherhood was outlawed as an illegal political organization. Two years after that, and the Gui was replaced with Nasser as the second president of Egypt, and his first action was to announce the nationalization of the Suez Canal is a manmade canal, was a trade super highway for the middle of England and France were pissed because they use the canal so much that they hatched a plan with Israel to overflow.

Speaker 3:          04:21          Naval Base Britain prepares well. The worst crisis,

Speaker 1:          04:25          it was a secret plan at a stupid plant and they should have told the US because when I found out he was pissed,

Speaker 4:          04:31          not consulted in any way about any phase of these actions.

Speaker 1:          04:34          Wes was like, get the fuck out of their service. Prestige was cemented by a proxy victory of the Suez Canal crisis. He rolled for another 18 years, promoted pan Arab Islam all throughout his term lead the six day war against Israel, which he lost embarrassingly and then he died quietly, is vice president Anwar Sadat succeeded him as the third president of Egypt, so that's most notable accomplishment was his participation in the camp. David accords with President Carter and Prime Minister David Ben Gurion, which led to the eventual peace treaty with Israel Treaty, which is still honored today, but Sudan and Egypt were ostracized for this from the Arab League. Opposition came at them from all sides and during a military parade on the sixth of October, 1981 for assassins broke through the barricades and killed his vice president. Hosni Mubarak assume power as the fourth and last president of Egypt. Mubarak maintain the peace agreement with Israel while salvaging Egypt's relationship with the Arab Lee being readmitted.

Speaker 1:          05:31          In 1989, he privatized much of the economy and Egypt saw extreme growth in the 19 nineties, partly due to the $14,000,000,000, had gotten debt relief for participation in the Gulf War, but Mubarak was an autocrat like sedans before him and Nasir before him. He reigned unchallenged for 26 years and in the first election that saw a second candidate in 2005. That candidate, Amen. Our was imprisoned and we can forget that Egypt has been under emergency law since 1967, which is spends constitutional rights legalize the censorship and extends police powers under Mubarak. There were repeated occurrences of police brutality and severe corruption among government officials who were hoarding massive amounts of wealth for themselves. By 2011 after a severe worldwide economic crisis, the emotion came to a head and we watched day by day as protestors storm tower your square and demanded Mubarak stepped down. After 29 years

Speaker 5:          06:31          inspired by a popular uprising in Tunisia, thousands of Egyptians took to the streets demanding the alto of president postnatal.

Speaker 1:          06:39          Oh, 800 years of history. You can see how Egypt has just a how it moved from a tribal state to assault in it to a kingdom to republic. You can see in Egypt the weight of Middle Eastern history as it tries to crash on the shore of freedom and democracy, but you can also see that their history is one of blood and ferment, lit exclusively by military leaders and always in flow well, it's the military who has control, again, as the interim leaders, a Supreme Council of Twenty generals postpones, a civilian rule government to the dismay of many protests begin again. Dozens have been killed, the council and apologizes, but it falls on deaf ears. Monday saw the start of a long process of parliamentary elections, which won't deliver a new president until mid to late 2012. In the meantime, the counsel stays in charge who will step forward. The Muslim Brotherhood made legal again after 57 years and sure to be a big winner in the first round of parliamentary election. Will it be leftists, revolutionaries, or just successes and Mu Bar? Nobody really knows how it's all going to turn out, but maybe this is the most important statistic. It's how much 40 percent of Egypt makes per day. Egyptians want change, but they need stability and with change there is no stability and with stability there is little change. How do they find democracy and who will be the stewards of revolution in Egypt and the movement and the movement called the three officers led by Muhammad and the movement and the movement called the Free Officers led by Mohammad.
