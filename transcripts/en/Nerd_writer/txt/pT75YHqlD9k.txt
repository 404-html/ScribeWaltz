Speaker 1:          00:13          Big Movies, genres have life cycles, they're born, they become popular, they exhaust themselves, and then if they're important enough, they transform. Hugh Jackman, 17 year tenure as wolverine. I think bookends to important milestones in the superhero film. Sean to thousands x men directed by Brian Singer was effectively the start of the superhero craze that's come to dominate Hollywood for nearly two decades and now 2017 slogan directed by James Mangled represents a response to the public's exhaustion. Would that dominance, if you want to understand how genres change the writer to look at is definitely John Qlt who's famous essay on generic transformation is I think a good rubric for what's happening in Logan go wealthy is basically interested in what occurs when genre conventions become so well known that the audience demands something new. What forms does that change? Take a look, wealthy identifies for burlesque nostalgia, demythologize nation, and reaffirmation.

Speaker 1:          01:14          Burlesque is essentially a ridiculous exaggeration or a parody of genre conventions. To Finish Leo [inaudible] quote from the start of this video, genres turned to self parody to say, well, at least if we can make fun of it for being infant tile, that will show how far we've come. Mel Brooks is of course a master at this kind of thing and not just for Westerns. Moments of burlesque can be found in serious movies too when a trope is made to suddenly look ridiculous, undercutting the fantasy with reality and the superhero genre. Deadpool film that helped pave the way for logan is a burlesque through and through

Speaker 2:          01:46          superhero landing. So you're going to do a superhero ladder. You wait for it. Superhero landing, yeah, that's really hard on your knees, totally impractical. They all do it.

Speaker 1:          01:58          Nostalgic films, the ones that are good anyway, do more than evoke a romanticized passed. They update, tried and true storylines with contemporary elements. They make the audience aware of the relationship between past and present qlt sites, true grit, but Shane Blacks Kiss, kiss, Bang, Bang, fits the bill as well. A hard boiled detective story in which many of the tropes are d romanticized, but the story ultimately follows the same beats of discovery and heroism. Hold on demythologize films, so the most complex of the bunch. They subject popular myths and conventions to a reality that undercuts and exposes them as inadequate or even harmful weld. These archetypal example of this is Roman Polanski, Chinatown, a film that follows the hard boiled detective genre of classic films like the Maltese Falcon or the big sleep. Until events become so dark and twisted and devoid of moral content that justice has never served in.

Speaker 1:          02:51          The detective is left severely traumatized, and another movie like this would be the Cohen brothers. No country for old men in which the law of the new West, Tommy Lee Jones not only fails to capture the villain, but fails to understand him. I don't want to post bond chips for and go out and meet something I don't understand. The final transformation is the reaffirmation of myth, that kind of film that subverts genre like the Dean mythologize film, but in the end chooses to reaffirm the myth not as something that's real, but it's something that we need to believe. I wonder if you could think of a superhero film that might fall into that category, so what is Logan? Clearly it represents some shift in this extraordinarily popular genre. If deadpool signals a self awareness that the myth of the superhero movie is losing a bit of it's power, then I think Logan is an attempt to interrogate the contours of that myth in order to see if there are any interesting directions left for it to go. Director James Mangold is a movie buff and something that's really interesting about logan is how he uses one genre to understand another mangled states. Logan's key theme via a scene from Shane, one of the most popular, and it claimed Westerns of all time. Matt has to be what it is.

Speaker 3:          04:09          Kept breaking. I tried it. It didn't work for me. Joy, there's no living with. There's no going back.

Speaker 1:          04:24          Westerns are really the perfect genre to measure the superhero movie. The Myth of the superhero is in many ways a reincarnation of the myth of the gunslinger. Both are heroes who act outside the law to protect the community at large, mangled makes these parallels explicit in a sequence midway through the movie when Logan, Charles, and Laura are taken in by a kindly family, the same way that Shane is taken in both logan and Shane help the family with work and protect them from greedy business interests, but those shane is somewhat haunted by his life is a gunslinger. His purpose and the code of laws he lives by is still necessary to protect the community. In the end. In mangolds version, the violence that follows the hero can't be contained far from the valley. Being saved. Logan's kindly family is mercilessly and utterly destroyed, and if the point wasn't clear, it's by none other than a clone of Logan himself.

Speaker 1:          05:15          This is the closest that logan comes to demythologize. The whole movie is a meditation on the violence that all superhero films imply by earning an r rating, mangled and Jackman get to show a type of visceral brutality that complicates the heroics of Logan's past as well as those of the x men and all superheroes like it does. Shane Logan holds up the romanticized past of previous superhero movies in the form of comic books. You do know they're all bullshit, right? Maybe a quarter of it happened and not let this. Logan is attempting to expose the inadequacy of these fantasies, trying to show that no personal moral code can wield power without risking devastation. This was made painfully clear in the character Xavier, who's aging mind it's implied, may have unintentionally killed a number of innocent mutants for Logan himself. The past exploits of heroism from the other movies, reemergence as trauma, nightmares, and the touching scene with Laura. Near the end, he even admits to contemplating suicide. Actually, I am

Speaker 1:          06:20          see shooting myself. Charles said in the end, Logan makes the final turn into reaffirmation, one last act of sacrificial heroics that reaffirms the myth even after exposing it as inadequate. You know, it makes me wonder if this is the limit of superhero movies. It's unclear whether a film that sought to fully demythologize this myth could ever really get made or if the genre itself is even mature enough to handle such a thing. In fact, I think Logan leaves us with these exact questions. The movie itself is a conversation between nostalgia for the genre and are increasing frustration with its limits. More than anything, I'm just excited for what's to come because it's transition periods like these, as qlt might say, when the really interesting thing.
