Speaker 1:          00:02          Coffee on a Tuesday in block 35,

Speaker 1:          00:15          so there's a way to use hashtags to categorize tweets or messages so that they show up more easily in searches, but I don't ever use hashtags like that. There are amazing political consequences to Hashtags, fast and easy ways to communicate to find information on a particular subject or event like a riot or a revolution, but I don't ever use hashtags like that. The hashtag was thriving when I came to it. People were already using it for all of those democratizing reasons I just mentioned as a way of networking or advocating, but the networking function of hashtags never really interested me, but I noticed that people were using hashtags in other ways to to express sarcasm or wit or inner monologue or self deprecation and I thought I can get into that. The first Hashtag I ever used was on an instagram photo I took in La.

Speaker 1:          01:00          Have a man who was dressed up as a yellow transformer who is done with his day just walking home from work in his costume. My caption was, melancholy transformer. Hashtag save. So, so at the expense of murdering comedy, by analyzing it, I was making a joke here about a man whose jobs seemed to be to dress up in a bulky transformers costume and walk around the streets of La and he didn't seem too happy about it. And hashtag save yourself. It's just a way of saying, you can do better than this. Just for a moment. Let's disregard all the ridiculous assumptions I'm making about this guy's life who I know nothing about who very well might love it's June, may very well just have gotten back from transformers. Cope very well, might have a perfectly normal fetish for dressing up as bubble who may very well be a transforming android.

Speaker 1:          01:44          Now I could've just said, save yourself no Hashtag, and the message I was trying to convey about this guy's life would have gotten across. What I'm interested in is whether or not the addition of a Hashtag as any literary value to the sentiment, and I think it does. I was mocking, but at the same time, borrowing the intended function of hashtags as a means to connect our expression in order to add a layer of subtext to the company instead of just telling this guy to get a life I was making like the Hashtag save yourself. Grouping already existed, that it was trending. People were adding to it as a way to infer that this ridiculous thing is only one example of millions of similarly ridiculous things, maybe even a ridiculous thing that you do with the Hashtag you invoke the community even when the community isn't there.

Speaker 1:          02:30          Of course I wasn't thinking this out as I did it and the only way that I learned the literary way of using hashtags is by seeing other people do it first and there are many other ways to use hashtags dramatically to express self deprecation or inner monologue for insecurity. I find it fascinating that we can't help but repurpose everything we see into stories, even metadata, metadata and your functions. We will take your metadata and make it into box. We are an race to say the least and it's no surprise to me that twitter caught on like it did. It's no surprise the effect it's already had on the world and it's no surprise that we figured out how to make little messages into big messages without ever changing the character counts. Hey, everyone and screen had been here. So I wanted to let you know that we did a story last week on lean forward about the one year anniversary of occupy Wall Street, which I've put on my facebook page and I'll put the link in the dually do. So from now on, that's where I'm going to put the links to videos or stories that I do on MSNBC. Um, besides that chagall 52 books they did two weeks. Don't forget to follow me on tumblr there. Um, and Hashtag goodbye.
