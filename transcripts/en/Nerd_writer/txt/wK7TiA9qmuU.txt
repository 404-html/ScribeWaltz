Speaker 1:          00:03          When you're smiling, when you're smiling, no. Why did I do that?

Speaker 1:          00:19          When people evaluate great actors, what often gets mentioned most is range, how many different characters they can play, how many different emotions they can realistically movingly show, but I think a criteria and that's just as telling as range is depth. How many different ways and actor can portray the same emotion. I spent the last few weeks watching pretty much every film Jack Nicholson ever made and it's clear that the man can do it all, but it's also no mistake. That intensity is calling card today. I'd like to explore the ways that Jack Nicholson conveys and uses anger in his work. The angles he approaches it from the spins and emphases he puts on it in order to see what makes Jack Nicholson so great. Anger is an emotional response or reaction to something that reaction manifests psychologically, but also physically and everyone's had that sensation of being convulsed with anger. What Nicholson shows again and again in his roles is how anger can literally possess the body like a spirit,

Speaker 2:          01:29          because I really want to know because it was a mistake, maybe we could do something about it.

Speaker 1:          01:35          This is the moment when anger becomes aggression. Half the time that aggression in Nicholson's work is realized as actual violence against someone else, whether it's psychotic violence or in some way justify the other. Half of the time this theatrical anger takes place in Nicholson's own personal space. He flails around sometimes as a threat or a suggestion of violence to come. A lot of the time it's just a release, a discharge of pent up energy. To me, these moments, the weird contortions and spasms that Nicholson makes are more poignant than actual attacks on people. There are kind of exploration of the relationship between body and mind and it never feels like overacting. I think that's because these gesticulation are all unique to the particular anger that they spring from. Whether it's focused, pointed, anger, or generally frustrated anger or petulant child.

Speaker 3:          02:37          We'll have to leave. I'm not taking any more of your time, Nicholson,

Speaker 1:          02:45          and everybody else for that matter. Anger can be a form of desperation, annoys so loud that you don't have to hear your own insecurities and Mike Nichols, carnal knowledge. For example, Nichols plays a playboy who objectifies women and refuses to commit. One of his lovers asks him to get married and he explodes.

Speaker 3:          03:03          Fuck is my shoe, or this place is a mess out half the time you looked like it fell out of bed.

Speaker 1:          03:10          Nicholson acts a kind of anger here that it's easy to see right through the larger and louder it is. The closer he is to recognizing a vulnerability in himself.

Speaker 3:          03:18          Do you want an extra $50 a week? Try back. You mean you want an extra hundred dollars? Make this Goddamn goddamn window. That's why he can stand up in here, the God damn place.

Speaker 1:          03:32          That's the challenge for an actor playing this emotion. You're not just playing anger, you're playing what's under it. Most anger isn't psychotic. It's only a thin veneer for what's brewing below and you have to be able to turn up the volume while preserving traces. Of this deeper motivation, that's what Nicholson excels at in the border. For example, Nicholson plays a border agent who gets caught up with his partner is human smuggling operation. When the partner starts killing his competition, Nicholson realizes that he's gotten into far the key emotion in this exchange is an anger, but fear, fear of what he's gotten himself into, fear that he won't be able to get himself out on Nicholson bursts with anger here, but it's in the silent moments where the actual feelings

Speaker 3:          04:15          like, I don't care about your fucking money. Fucking life is going to be fine before I ever get involved murder. You understand what I'm saying to you?

Speaker 1:          04:24          This is why you Nicholson's characters seem real in their anger. Even with great writing and great direction. It's only the actor who can make a character polyphonic like more than one thing is happening at the same time, and even when you do that, that particular expression of anger has to rise out of the particular character's personality. For example, take these two examples of anger which are both underlaid with a strong sense of superiority. Can't handle the truth. Son, we live in a world that has walls and those walls have to be guarded by men with guns. Who's gonna do it you, you, Lieutenant Weinberg, never, never interrupt me. Okay? Not if there's a fire. Not even if you hear the sound of a thud from my home in one week later, there's a smell coming from there. There can only be a decaying human body and you have to hold Hanky to your face because the stench is so thick that you think you're going to faint. Both of these men feel smarter and more important than the person they're lecturing too, but the first is a lifelong military man. In a court of law, Nicholson barely moves his body or head. Every swivel of the neck is measured and exact. You so restrained that a simple lean forward feels like he's lost it.

Speaker 3:          05:37          I did the job, God damn right, I did.

Speaker 1:          05:41          The second man is smug and in his own space, his movements are freer, looser, and they even seemed to mock great kinnear's, homosexuality. Don't know not on this, not for any reason you get me, sweetheart. No two expressions of anger are the same, not in real life and not in Nicholson's work. Sometimes his anger, his comedic, sometimes cartoonish. Sometimes it's quiet, sometimes it's misplaced and sometimes it's deeply, deeply wounded. Whatever you're doing stuff,

Speaker 3:          06:23          whatever you're doing, stop it. I hope you die. I hope you fucking die.

Speaker 1:          06:34          Watching so much of Nicholson's acting, you start to get a sense of the larger shape of anger as a human phenomenon. It's extremes, its physicality and it's dangerous, but also its necessity in the course of a life. None of us can avoid anger. You can't remove it from the constellation of feelings, but you can't understand it. Jack Nicholson has a wide range of talents as wider range as an actor, as anybody else, and yet if all he ever did was give us these 60 years of insights into anger, it would still be a career well spent.

Speaker 1:          07:16          Hey everybody. Thanks for watching. That was a lot of Jack Nicholson movies to see, but it was totally worth it. You learn a lot by watching a master at. Thanks for watching that and thank you to the great courses plus for sponsoring this video. If you don't know what it is, the great courses plus is an on demand video. Learning service basically means it's got over 70,000 online video lecture series from some Great Ivy League professors and other professors about all kinds of subjects, math and history and archeology, but one that I think meshes with what we were just talking about with acting is this course by Daniel Robinson called the great ideas in psychology, sort of which go all along the history of psychology to, to overview what's been talked about and discover it. And, and that's sort of my wheelhouse. So I love to learn that kind of stuff. Check that out. If you go to the great courses plus.com/nerd writer, you can get a 30 day free trial. You can find that as the first link in the description down there. Um, after that it's 1490 $9 a month. I think it's really cool. If you like learning, I think you'd really love it. Thanks guys for watching. I will see the rest of you next Wednesday.
