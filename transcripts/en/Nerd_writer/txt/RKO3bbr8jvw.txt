Speaker 1:          00:01          Well, I have 20 minutes to five. We can now say the decision taken in 1975 by this country to join. The common market has been reversed by this referendum to leave the EU.

Speaker 2:          00:15          You know whether you think brexit is a good or a bad idea at this point. One thing is beyond doubt. It's an idea whose time has come to the independent United Kingdom. This isn't something that just happened. What the world witness last Friday was the culmination of a pressure movement that started over 20 years ago, a movement that has evolved and evolved across the years and bite it. It's time exploiting every national and political crisis to achieve its end. Now, of course, choosing a starting point for this is a bit arbitrary. There have been so called euroskeptic since 1973 when the UK first joined, what was then called the European community, but if I had to pick a date, I might pick September 20th, 1988. When Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher gave a famous speech in Bruge, laying out a number of the ideas that would influence euro skepticism for years to come.

Speaker 3:          01:10          We have not successfully rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain own to see them reimposed, so tiotropium level with the European superstate exercising or new dominance from Brussels.

Speaker 2:          01:23          The result of the speech with something called the Bruce Group, a conservative think tank that promoted rolling back the [inaudible] trend towards centralization. Remember, this was at the end of the Soviet Union and the world's great experiment with socialism. Any form of one party centralization was a feared prospect by many. One member of the Bruce Group, the historian Alan Scott, took the idea a step further and launched his own political party. It was called the Anti federalists league and it's one aim was to remove Britain from the EU. We call Rhonda and affairs. Nobody can. This should be old, too obvious, but skids party had problems from the very start. In 1992, the anti federalists league went up for only one seat in parliament and only got point two percent of the vote, and it was the same in the European elections in 1995. The young movement just lost faith in [inaudible] ability to lead them and there were internal arguments about whether the party which was soon renamed Ukip or the United Kingdom Independence Party should remain a single issue, pressure group or expand into other issues and become a real party.

Speaker 2:          02:26          That in 1994 arrival, euro skeptic party called the referendum party, exploded onto the scene, led by a billionaire, James Goldsmith, who had no such problems with infighting. All he wanted to do was have a referendum about leaving the EU, and once they got it, they would dispatch a politician's betraying trust by holding a referendum which is binding on the government. The referendum party trounced Ukip in 1997, but both were trounced by Tony Blair and the rise of New Labor which would hold the country for the next 13 years. And yet for those who were looking closely, it was possible to see Elaine opening up for doubt about the EU. In 92. Only nine percent thought Britain should leave the EEC by 97. That number had risen to 14 percent. And if you added to those who thought the EEC should at least reduce its powers and you have 66 percent of the electorate expressing some form of euro skepticism, there are a number of reasons why Europe was brought into voters' minds, but the most significant has got to be the signing of the master treaty and the adoption of a single currency.

Speaker 2:          03:30          Something that in 1997, only 16 percent of Britain's were in favor of despite these trends, you can look dead in the water, but it was about to hit a few strokes of good luck. Well, bad luck for James Goldsmith who passed away only three months after the 97 election. Effectively disbanding Ukips only direct competitor Alan scared was replaced by more aggressively populous figures like Nigel Farrage, who was himself a seat in 1999. And ironically the European Parliament by 2001, despite not winning any parliament seats in Westminster, Ukip had become the fourth party in the UK. After labor conservatives and the Liberal Democrats, their profile rose even more. When Robert Kilroy Silk, a former MP and chat show personality join the

Speaker 4:          04:16          the main issue, politicians in London decided to open our doors to a potential 70 million migrants from eastern Europe. That $73 million

Speaker 2:          04:26          kilroy silk was a controversial figure stemming mostly from an article he wrote called we owe Arabs. Nothing. Silk delivered you kips largest victory in 2004 is European parliamentary elections coming in third above the Liberal Democrats, but more infighting eventually ousted him from the party within that year. Yet his example shows the willingness of UK to engage in the worst forms of populism, race, baiting, nationalism, and fear. Throughout the two thousands and into the 20 tens, you kept capitalized on a growing sentiment among the British people of national decline in the post colonial era. Most keenly felt by the oldest citizens who made up the core of the vote to brexit. They capitalized to on crises like the financial meltdown in 2008, the riots that swept the country in 2011, and now the migrant crisis and international terrorism, Ukip and the far right assigned folk devils to many of these cases like immigrants, Muslims, minorities, and welfare recipients. All of these things can bolster resentful, nationalism, but they have to be triggered by something closer to home. In this case, a lot of the research points to the idea of class trajectory. I have no

Speaker 5:          05:38          p as all up in my area. I can't get onto the housing ladder and have three kids in one room. A place where I grew up is now was a lovely area, but it's now a no go zone. How are you, Mike? I can see my style of living in. My family's done living, going down because of this influx that we can't control.

Speaker 2:          05:55          You can't say that you kept is the soul force behind Brexit, but they've been there throughout the years to help link these real feelings of falling trajectories to emotions about national decline and moral panics. That group, the public and fear growing from minuscule routes into a significant player in the country's politics. The United Kingdom is not a far right state with a nationalistic anti-immigrant and racist people, but their decision last week to leave the EU one by a 52 percent, majority of 72 percent of the population can be viewed as an expression of a reactionary far right politics, and that's the point about far right political organizations, they use the fulcrum of populism and fear to lift many times their weight in people. The ideas that animated this vote are there in Thatcher speech from 1988. Of course, the irony is that that's your herself campaign for Britain to join the EEC the first time around in 1975. The even greater irony is that the unchecked capitalism she championed as prime minister lead to a form of globalization that has ravaged the middle class, the real cause of the frustration that you kept exploits to advocate of leaf foe, but that's the difference that 40 years can make. Brexit, recontextualizes, all these small phenomenon threads a string through them and shows that transformation doesn't always
