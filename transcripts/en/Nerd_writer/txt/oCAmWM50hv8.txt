Speaker 1:          00:05          There is a certain natural phenomenon that you may or may not be familiar with, a facial expression made by the human when one of its number is holding and reading a book. The head is slightly raised, turned at 20 to 30 degrees from the forward eyes widen slowly. Pupils dilate. Vision enhances this, followed by a momentary paralysis in which a number of subjects have recorded a feeling of quote, loveliness. Here it is in its closest approximation,

Speaker 1:          00:43          and here are some of the commonly sited causes. What is that feeling when you're driving away from people and they recede on the plane till you see their specs dispersing. It's the two huge world vaulting us and it's goodbye, but we lean forward to the next crazy venture beneath the skies for a moment of phrase, tried to take shape in my mouth and my lips parted like a dumb man's as though there was more struggling upon them than a wisp of startled air, but they made no sound and what I had almost remembered was incommunicable forever. A solemn consideration. When I enter a great city by night that every one of those darkly clustered houses in closes its own secret that every room and every one of them encloses it's own secret, that every beating heart in the hundreds of thousands of breasts there is in some of it's imagining, so secret to the heart, nearest it.

Speaker 1:          01:32          There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio than are dreamt of in your philosophy. Maybe you know the feeling and if you do, you could like I did produce a list of quotes that triggers the same natural phenomenon in you and knowing that you know that these words don't just knock us around intellectually, but physically they twist us into knots or untie the tightest ones within us. They put us face to face with our illusions are bigotries our preconceptions. You know that to grasp just one sentence of the very best writing is to grasp a thousand sentences of great writing, which is to grasp 10,000 sentences of good. Right? And in this way, great books are very expensive things. They come at the cost of thousands and thousands of sentences. They come at the cost of dozens of easier books and children's books and picture books and simple poems and sing along songs. They come at the cost of a room to read room to read, promotes literacy around the world by building libraries and getting kids access to books, helping millions to put their very first down payments on dickens or Shakespeare. This is a phenomenon we should help everyone to feel

Speaker 2:          02:47          right.
