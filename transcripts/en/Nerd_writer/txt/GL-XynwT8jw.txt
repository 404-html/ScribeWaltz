Speaker 1:          00:09          If you go to Vimeo.com staff picks page, you'll find several short films that play in the same meticulously designed weird art house thriller space. As Jonathan glazers under the skin. You see that kind of thing on the web more than you do in the theater because supreme ambiguity as a cinematic category rarely attracts investment. The reason for this is contemptible, but obvious, the lack of explanation or closure is painful. It hurts, as m John Harrison says, therapists and unwillingness to serve up that failure to film goers, that pain, that anxiety has ruled Hollywood from the start. So ideas like these find a home on the web which embraces everything. Art, how shorts are potent because there are brief 20 minutes at the very longest, happy to contain a single question to be a single question. What makes under the skin so special is that it maintains the same potency across 108 minutes.

Speaker 1:          01:16          The movie follows scarlet Johansen as Laura a blank face, but beautiful alien as she follows and ensnares young men who are never to be seen or heard from. Again, watching listlessly at the beach as a couple and their dog drowned in a strong undertow. It's made clear that Laura does not possess a traditional set of morals, if any, at all. A few compatriot aliens with speed bikes act as a cleanup crew for her nocturnal activities and make sure she keeps on schedule. Plot wise, that's pretty much it. The interactions between Laura and her victims are tense and gripping in between. Glazer treats us to long carefully frame takes of pedestrians at shopping centers or Johansen's face filmmakers. Hold on images so you can examine them. If you see this film in theaters, be sure to let your eyes wander. I was struck by the depth of the Scottish landscapes, the camera always sure to have elements in the for middle and background, more three dimensional than anything you need glasses for, particularly when contrasted with the surreptitious camera work, glazer use to capture real Scott's from the window of Laura's nondescript white van pepper throughout his imagery of a more surreal for variety, evoking Kubrick at times mostly in its boldness and not as much as the trailer suggests strung together by the perfect screening score of Nica Levitt.

Speaker 1:          02:43          Then toward the end of the film, Laura's inhumanity begins to peel back just in time for humanity to show its darkest side. We finally glimpse what's under the skin, but as she or it an alien, the Michel novel on which under the skin is based says so even glaser who's adaptation runs far afield of the source material has said explicitly that Johansen's character is other worldly taking the film as it is. However, I'm not so sure there is no question that Laura is alien and all that adjective means unfamiliar, disturbing, distasteful. It's impossible to parse or motivations except for in the broadest strokes here to the novel goes into much, much more detail, but I'm wary to identify anything that the film itself doesn't choose to. Maybe Laura is just the demonstration of a feeling, an embodiment of all in nature that is reminisce, but disinterested or just the idea of disinterest set loose in the locks and undertows of human yearning.

Speaker 1:          03:49          Even this I'm afraid is saying too much art. House movies are unapologetic in their use of cinemas. Unique toolbox as a medium of light and sound of imagery. Film is an innately ambiguous language. Filmmakers like laser, no doubt express their vision in this form because actual language wasn't up to their task. Why then should we try to bring movies like under the skin, back to the page? It works so hard to transcend because the alternative is paint that vast ambiguous space like a dark, empty room where you can be ensnared by something evocative, ensnared and suddenly consumed. Never learning why.
