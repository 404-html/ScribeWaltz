Speaker 1:          00:17          What's going on? What's going on? Tell me what's going on, what's going on? What's going on? What's going on? What's going on? That's the question that Larry Gopnik, the ill fated protagonist of the Cohen Brothers dark comedy. A serious man keeps asking. It's a reflexive and sort of stupid question. One in response to a series of unfortunate events that seem to be tearing Larry's quiet, contented suburban life apart without cause. First his wife demands a divorce. Then his student tries to blackmail him for a passing grade than his neighbor infringes on his property. Then his wife's lover dies and he's forced to pay for it. Then his brother gets in trouble with the law and he has to pay for that too. Then his chance at tenure is threatened by anonymous hate mail. The also gets into a car accident, witnesses the death of his lawyer and is forced to pay for a record subscription.

Speaker 1:          01:10          Even though I didn't do anything. Being a Coen brothers movie, each of these situations compound and unfold into one another with surgical precision, and they are each individually illustrative of their own batch of themes which taken together a sort of shape out the central message of the movie, like one of those optical illusions that demonstrate closure. Of course, there is no real closure in a serious man, just as there's not really a shape in the illusion that doesn't stop Larry from seeking it, though he wants to understand what he's done to deserve such misfortune, seemingly unaware of what the audience could see, clear as day that it's Larry's inaction is constant refrain of haven't done anything that causes so many of his problems. Larry knows that actions have consequences, but inaction has consequences to instead of grappling with this fact, Larry looks for a way to interpret his suffering.

Speaker 1:          02:06          Seeking out the counsel of three rabbis, the first, uh, junior rabbi lectures Larry on the importance of spective. That's what it is. Larry. The second tells a convoluted parable about a dentist who finds a message and a patient's teeth that never resolves itself illustrating the inscrutability of God's plan. And the third rapper, he, elderly wise, rabbi Marsha refuses to see him altogether, liberalizing the heavenly silence in the face of big questions that prompted Larry Search for advice in the first place. A lot of the things that Larry, heres our cliches, like the need to change your perspective, the parking lot, larry, and yet many of them are true. Of course, cliche and parable are two devices that people use to understand what's going on and they're not the only that a serious man has to offer. Larry Son Danny uses music and so does their next door neighbor, Mrs Samsky.

Speaker 1:          03:01          Larry's brother, uses a complex probability map of the universe called the mentality. Alice and Larry himself teaches the theories of physics and mathematics, namely and equation that seems to definitively prove the underwriting uncertainty of all things. I want to concede that it's subtle, clever, but at the end of the day, is it convincing at its core? This film questions the persuasiveness of every interpretive device by placing them side by side and showing how they fail to work together and form any kind of semblance of coherence. The koans communicate the real dread of a world that's become unreadable and they take this failure down to the most basic form of interpretation, the use of language, a lot of attention is paid to the language of Hebrew and ancient language that's lost much of its force in the modern world. Indeed, even in the 19 sixties, young Danny Gopnik was doing exactly what I did when faced with a Torah portion to learn from my bar Mitzvah and he had vinyls. I had tapes, but neither of US learned to read or understand the Hebrew. Instead, we memorize the sounds that to us remain

Speaker 2:          04:11          right up share

Speaker 1:          04:14          Danny can't find his place when the time comes because those symbols are as incomprehensible as the mentality is, and even in English several times in the film, people are asked to repeat things or just hear them as nonsense near Sir my sir nea. So, so interpretation is how we nailed down the world around us. Word by word, feeble by feeble equation by equation. We secure the storm of experience onto fixed points, and when these started to come undone and unforeseen circumstances are always threatening to do that, it can be very traumatic. We like Larry reach for anything that can orient us, explains the appeal of religion, yet a serious man documents it's ever decreasing usefulness in the modern age. Of course, this criticism of interpretive methods ought to make us realize that we're watching a form of interpretation, the cinematic narrative, a serious man, a film in which every element is ambiguous in which cause and effect the engine of any narrative is willfully disregarded.

Speaker 1:          05:22          Suggest that film and story are plagued by the same problems, has all the other devices, despite what Hollywood would have you believe. One of the most confounding things about the film is it's opening prologue of short fable filmed in a different aspect ratio about a Jewish couple in the old country who stab and maybe kill either a good Samaritan or a demon. The prologues meaning and its relationship to the rest of the film are totally nebulous. There's just enough the maddix similarity to prompt interpretation, but once you try, the only outcome can frustration moving the viewer into a head space like that is neither pretentious nor unwieldy. It's the effect of a subtle experienced and masterful craftsmanship and the Coen brothers have been doing this for years. I just didn't understand, but a serious man is there most explicit account of oblique but unflinching philosophy.

Speaker 1:          06:17          I don't understand. One that remains skeptical about the things we believe film, story and interpretation can do and understands that the big philosophical truths about human life are devastatingly symbol. There is no god. There is no objective or cosmic purpose for us. People experience joy to varying degrees, but everybody suffers. Anyone can figure these things out with the small amount of observation, introspection and study, and once you do that dim feeling of disappointment will always be there, but there should also be relief. The kind of relief you can only get when putting aside questions that are really a waste of time because only when the reflexive and sort of stupid questions are dropped and the better questions be asked. Better questions like whether or not
