Speaker 1:          00:00          So this is the last blog I'm going to be doing in this apartment. I'm moving out of here next week. So say goodbye to the beautiful brick wall that I love so much. Also coffee on a Tuesday and flogged. Fifty nine.

Speaker 2:          00:22          Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:23          Nationally, we've dealt with our share of tragedies in recent months. Last October, Hurricane Sandy caused an estimated $71,000,000,000 in damage to the east coast in December. 20 children were shot and killed at Sandy Hook elementary in Connecticut in April. Two bombs were set off at the Boston marathon and just last week a massive tornado literally uprooted and Oklahoma town killing 24 internationally. There are of course, tragedies beyond counting for some such tragedies are a way of life, a daily affair for those who have experienced the paint, the residents at the Jersey shore, the parents of the children at Newtown, the marathon runners who trained and trained and were robbed in violence of their triumph there opens up beneath them a new basement of feeling which many of us cannot and hopefully we'll never know, such pain in this country, especially in those relatively safe neighborhoods like the one I grew up in, must be alienating.

Speaker 1:          01:18          I've never experienced intense suffering, never seen death or had someone very close to me die. So by what language could the victim communicate to me, his sorrow? What responsibility do I have to feel, and what responsibility do I have to feel the day to day suffering for those in parts of the world to whom such deep pain is not alienating but inclusionary. For a short time after college, I studied philosophy and I've found that the more I read, the more reading seemed insufficient. I was studying philosophy to figure out what to do and ironically, as the concept of truth became increasingly murky to me, how to act became increasingly playing, the only thing really worth doing, I've found was helping other people. Of course, people need help in a variety of ways. In Stardust memories. Woody Allen's

Speaker 3:          02:10          says, excuse me, you don't have enough to eat or something that becomes a major problem in has become very clear cut, but what happens if you're living in a more, you know, a more affluent society and you're lucky enough to to not have to worry about that. Let's say you're surviving, so then you problems become, how can I fall in love or why can't they fall in love more accurately and why do I age and die and what meaning can my life possibly have? The issues become very complex for, you know, for a guy that makes a lot of funny movies, you're kind of a depressive. You know,

Speaker 1:          02:42          Alan is describing mazlow's hierarchy of needs, a hierarchical list of our human needs often shown as a pyramid from our most fundamental to our most complex, from our physiological needs of food and shelter, to our need of safety, of friendship, self esteem, and finally of self actualization, our needs of creativity and morale. The idea is that one cannot ascend the pyramid until the needs of lower orders are satisfied as a novelist and Vlogger, as one with food, shelter, safety, self-esteem, friends, I aim to treat issues of self actualization for myself and others. That's what this blog is, but that's also a choice. It means that my experience in its attempts at profundity will be holy and necessarily different from mine. This is Sean Ahmed of the uncultured project. Sean withdrew from Grad School after hearing a speech by Dr Jeffrey Sachs about poverty. He liquidated his savings and left his life to start a project in which he uses technology and the web to bring those in need together with what they need. Teaming up with various organizations. Sean has provided clean water to villages, rebuilt a high school, destroyed by a psych loan, provided emergency relief in multiple disaster areas and helped over 10,000 children through longterm health worker programs.

Speaker 4:          04:04          I just returned from Bangladesh where two major events happened. First was the garment factory collapse, which killed over 1000, 100 people. Also episodes of Muslim extremist violence, uh, which over a quarter million Muslim extremist congregated in the city. There were clashes with security forces in many. What I'm feeling right now are Bangladeshis, resilience to tragedy. And it's very hard to talk about this in a way that doesn't romanticize the poor or those suffering because in many respects, because they can handle it or they seem to be handling it. And I couldn't. Sometimes it makes me feel like I should put them on a pedestal for me. I can actually have a normal day and then I could go to an h and m and then all of a sudden I'm getting flashbacks of the garment factory collapse. Or I can watch a movie where people die and they get flashbacks of the more. I saw corpses from the Muslim extremists. We're. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          04:56          I don't. Let's not show them just to keep it on me. Sean is livid. The conclusion I came to a few years ago, a conclusion that I entertained in the comfort of my largely painless existence, but one which I did not see through for reasons of family, vocation and cowardice. To see what maslow doesn't cover is whether or not it's okay to ascend the hierarchy of needs when just one other person with whom you share the world lacks the fundamentals of life for any need of a lower order. When people ask me, I tell them that I'm a writer because I feel I have a knack for it because I believed that I could add something significant to the history of literature. About 60 percent of me believes that more or less by turns. Of course, these things don't have to be mutually exclusive. The vlog brothers, self actualizer is if there ever were, have raised millions of dollars for charities through Kiva Dot Com and the project for awesome last year.

Speaker 1:          05:56          $14 of that project for awesome money went to kids in need of desks in Milan this year. Tens of thousands of dollars. These go into the uncultured project. These things make a real difference in the world, but now I will return to my videos in my writing. Sean will return to his hands on work in Bangladesh and though sat just inches apart. We are separated by a Gulf of experience, a Gulf of pain and suffering and a sensory knowledge of privileges that feel to me like mere facts, a golf which I cannot cross. Let me go for which many in Bangladesh and to some extent me can never cross.

Speaker 5:          06:46          Hey everybody. Thanks for watching. Thank you. So, so here's the do one take videos. So I get to do this. It will be here for quite a while. So if you should check out his other videos, he will have invitations to various video, but no on what you're seeing us right now. There'll be an annotation to the uncultured project. Goes there and watch all of Sean's videos. I admire everything he does. I think it's absolutely incredible and I think you'll think that to get here.
