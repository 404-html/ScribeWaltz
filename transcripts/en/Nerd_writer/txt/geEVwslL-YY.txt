Speaker 1:          00:05          We have people coming into our country that are looking to do tremendous harm. Exactly. One year ago today, I did my best to explore the way Donald Trump answers a question. His use of language in speech I thought was fascinating and unique and illuminated. Why he's so successful at selling a feeling now that trump has been president elect for 50 days. We don't get to hear much of trump's speech anymore. His interview appearances are dwindling and his press conferences or nonexistent, but that doesn't mean he stopped using and manipulating language these days. The language that trump puts on the public record and comes largely from writing, specifically from writing on twitter in 140 character notes as of December 29th, 2016, trump has tweeted 221 times as the president elect. It's important to note at the outset that these tweets come largely from a few sources. Thanks to info from the metadata.

Speaker 1:          01:01          We know that of the 221, 153 or 69 percent come from an android phone. Trump's personal samsung galaxy 59 or 27 percent come from an iphone and nine or four percent come from the twitter web client as in someone typing the tweets into a computer. A number of commentators and data analysts have surmised that the iphone tweets are not written by trump himself, but by his staff. I think that's almost certainly true. If you look at those tweets exclusively, you capture all of the announcements and cabinet picks as well as the holiday messages and the notes of condolence of those 59 tweets, 49 share links or are retweets and all or almost all of them are likely written by Dan Scavino, trump's director of social media or Brad Parscale, a website designer turned high level staffer who trump and trusted with tweeting for him during the presidential debates of the 153 tweets that come from trump's personal samsung.

Speaker 1:          01:58          Not One shares a link, so that's a good rule of thumb. If you want to determine which tweets are from him and which aren't. The huge majority of the android tweets are trump's personal thoughts or reactions. Then you can split them up in a few ways. For example, 40 of those are positive were congratulatory and tone. Ninety four are negative or critical in tone and 19 are pretty much neutral like in a speech. One thing trump is really, really good at is emotionally framing his tweets and most of them are emotionally charged, which is why 87 percent of them are negative or positive in tone. Trump doesn't want a sympathetic reader to spend any time at all the ciphering, how to feel about what he's saying. A lot of people have mocked the way he concludes tweets with one or two word exclamations like sad or too bad, but these punctuations are actually powerful framing devices that lubricate the content of his message.

Speaker 1:          02:53          They also reflect a key insight that trump has knowingly or unknowingly about twitter and texting as a form of communication. While tweets are technically a kind of writing, scholars have long theorize that computer mediated communication more closely resembles speech than writing were funky punctuation substitutes for conversational cues. For example, every time you see someone extend toward by adding letters saying, I'm so sad, or I love breaking bad, what they're essentially doing is trying to transmit some emotional content that would have existed in face to face conversation, instant messages, text messages and tweets attract these speech like qualities and Donald trump understands this. While he doesn't extend words with extra letters, his punctuation at the end of tweets are extremely speech. Slide 50, one of his 153 personal tweets end with exclamations like this. In [inaudible] 95, there was at least one exclamation point. Whereas opponents and other politicians right through twitter, trump speaks through.

Speaker 1:          03:55          Instead of asking us to read, he forces us to here, but all of this begs the important question, what's the point? Trump is no longer a candidate. He doesn't have to persuade us to vote for him. I mean, you could spend a lot of time looking at a tweet like this from the president elect of the United States scratching your head and you could wonder about the message or the distraction it causes were the headlines that generates, but if that's the way you think, this man will always baffled you. Trump doesn't resemble other politicians on twitter. He resembles the rest of us. He resembles that person you know on facebook who was posting all the time about how happy they are. Nice people don't tweet or post because they're trying to relay relevant information. They do it to carefully craft their own identities against some imagined audience that exists only to reinforce what they need to believe.

Speaker 1:          04:48          The media and the public act like trump's tweets contain messages that were meant to receive when the truth is, I think that he's not thinking of us at all. When you look at it through this lens, trump's twitter account makes a lot more sense. It makes sense that a lot of his congratulatory tweets are self congratulatory and his negative tweets, which account for an astounding majority are personal in their attacks and sense of victimization, and it makes sense that we should react to it so strongly. We're all in this age of social media, intimately familiar with this kind of behavior. We do it ourselves every day. What we're not familiar with not yet at least is this kind of thing from the most powerful person in the world. How it will fall out when you hold a position where even your words desperately tweeted into the void, have global impact, but give it time and we will be.

I have to think crunchy roll for sponsoring this episode. If you really love anime shows, which I do and you can't find what you're looking for on Netflix, you can go to control. It's like the Netflix of animated. They have hd episodes, thousands of titles, something areas in Japan. You can get it an hour later on. Crunchy roll. I want to recommend attack on Titan, which is super, super weird show, but an amazing show I can pitch you. Love it.
