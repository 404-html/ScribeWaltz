Speaker 1:          00:04          Detective fiction always turns on it's revelations on those moments when information suddenly transforms into cause and effect, no one is better at achieving those revelations. Then private detective Sherlock Holmes, and these days no one is better at visualizing them. Then the creators of Sherlock, the intoxicatingly inventive TV show that uses and imagines film editing as a function of its main character's mind.

Speaker 2:          00:33          You said your life turned on one word.

Speaker 3:          00:36          Yes. The name of the person the father wanted to kill.

Speaker 1:          00:39          Today I want to look at how sherlock gets from point a to point b from problem to solution, mystery to clarity, and one of the shows most extraordinary visual revelations. It's a sequence that lasts three minutes and 42 seconds with a fresh, weird idea and almost every beat. It's a complete joy to watch unfold.

Speaker 2:          00:59          You said your life turned on one word.

Speaker 3:          01:02          Yes. The name of the person the father wanted to kill

Speaker 1:          01:05          the background is this, the daughter of famous multimillionaire Culverton Smith knows her father wants to kill someone but doesn't know who it is. I need to kill someone and she was told the name once, but under the influence of a drug that wiped her memory. All she knows is that it's one word

Speaker 2:          01:22          that's the impossible thing. Just that right there. Some possible names are one word that always at least two.

Speaker 1:          01:28          The added element here at one that's going to spin this revelation into a whole nother gear is that Sherlock Holmes is on drugs. He's been shooting cocaine, a reference to the original Conan doyle stories, and it's accelerating and twisting his mind. In fact, it's a pain of withdrawal from these drugs that puts the entire sequence in motion.

Speaker 4:          01:49          You know what? I expect it. What am I nicer

Speaker 1:          02:11          in a mystery, a revelation on the part of the detective or the audience only works when it arises from information already known. What's new is the perspective, and that change in perspective is triggered usually by something that doesn't mean to. I mean this kind of revelation is a cliche by now, but what sherlock does differently is stage those perspective shifts in its camera work and editing. In that first subsequence, we see sherlock from every possible angle, even from one that's impossible thanks to his drug induced state, punctuated by subliminal negative shots of the confession paper that faith was holding and a compliment.

Speaker 4:          02:52          You know what? I expect it nicer. Anyone.

Speaker 1:          03:03          It's not just that sherlock recontextualizes old information. The filmmakers take great pains to choreograph a relationship between old and new perspectives that is conversational, like the present and the past are speaking to each other. In this part. For example, sherlock stalks the location of an old episode, the previous one, but now everything is changed. Instead of seeing the street from a different angle, we see it from a totally different camera lens. Adding to that sense of attenuated drugged up disorientation and hear the conversation with the past is even more literal. It's a present shot. Past reverse shot is only one way that I've been sold. If you've already moved the camera and you've already changed the Lens, why not transplant an entire set from earlier in the episode? I need to kill something.

Speaker 4:          03:51          Hey,

Speaker 1:          03:56          anyone? Anyone? Anyone else?

Speaker 4:          04:03          Anyone? Anyone? Anyone? Anyone.

Speaker 1:          04:08          Even more impressive than how Sherlock arrives at his revelation is how the hero untangles, what that means, and what can only be called a leapfrog scene. Transition. Maybe my favorite of all time. Sherlock awakes from his reverie. It goes like this. Sherlock realizes where he is in the middle of a busy street, a man yells at him, reverse shot, sherlock, reverse shot. That man is now his drug dealing friend on the street reverse shot, sherlock, reverse shot. His drug dealing friend is actually speaking to him from Baker Street. Reverse shot sherlock still outside, reverse shot drug dealer telling him that he's actually at Baker street to reverse shot. Cue the best location, transition effort. Now let's watch that in real time. What are you doing? What were you doing in the middle of a bloody street? Baker Street. So will you.

Speaker 4:          05:19          It's

Speaker 1:          05:20          hard to imagine a scenario where more could be accomplished with 10 shots and sherlock's mind catches up with itself and he grapples with the thought of just how many serial killers might be hiding behind wealth and fame like Culverton Smith, the revelation, the drugs and the sequence reach their crescendo with the set itself turning on its axis. It's important I think to remember that what we've seen here has taken place in the span of only three minutes and 42 seconds. I mean there are full movies with fewer original ideas. There is no CGI in the sequence, no digital fireworks. This is just filmmaking, just the laws of editing embodied brilliantly as the workings of an extraordinary mind.
