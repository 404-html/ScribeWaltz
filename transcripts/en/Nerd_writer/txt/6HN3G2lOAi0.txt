Speaker 1:          00:05          So in the very first sentence or the New York Times review of reservoir dogs, critic Benson camping wrote, it's been an unusually good year for the discovery of first rate new American film directors then goes on to list for films that you've never seen by four directors that you've never heard of, none of whom lasted more than a decade, making movies before continuing. Now add to that list the name of Quentin Tarantino, I guess one out of five ain't bad.

Speaker 1:          00:34          Twenty five years after that, Review Tarantino was probably the most popular living working director in the world after maybe Spielberg and Scorsese is eight. Films have grossed over one point $5,000,000,000 worldwide and writing about his work could fill a small library. The quarter century milestone is a good opportunity to look back at how Terentino's first film has aged. I have a slight obsession with first with how things begin in the first shot of reservoir dogs is probably the first that I think about the most. Okay. Yeah. Obviously, I know this is not technically the first shot of the movie, but I've always sort of viewed the diner scene that proceeds the opening credits. That's a kind of overtures Terentino's entire filmography. Traditionally overtures are moot centers, a little bit of music that sets the tone for what's about to follow. It's only natural that in Terentino's land, the overture is a seven minute conversation about Madonna songs and the merits of tipping, but society says, don't have these guys over here, but tip these guys over here. That's bullshit. So the first shot of the story proper is this, and it's one of the most electrifying openings in film history, like the first notes in the first led Zepplin album. Before you have a chance to blink, you're involved, your mind fans forward and backward through time. It's usual in film for actions to have consequences, but here, consequences have actions, actions to begin to imagine the heist gone long

Speaker 1:          02:02          just like you're in the past. You're also in the future calculating how long this guy has left to live and what can be done to save him, and of course like Mr Orange bleeding out. You can't escape the present either because that's what pain is a brutal and specific attention to the present moment. It's that pain, that panicked feeling of time running out that separates this film from others that begin in media read. Whenever I create anything, I always hold it up against the opening of reservoir dogs is the beginning as attention capturing as this. Does it have the same kinetic energy launching you into the narrative? It's here too. Of course, that were introduced to the technique that made Terentino's famous. The nonlinear structure of his storytelling and interviews Terentino's compared the Byzantine tracks of his early films to novel writing. Novelists have always had just a complete freedom.

Speaker 1:          02:51          Pretty much tell their story anyway. They saw fit. Alright, and that's Kinda what I'm kind of what I'm trying to do, but while I think the comparison to fiction apt, I also think that there is a relationship here again with USAC. One of the things that I think help reservoir dogs age so well is Terentino's instinctive sense for narrative momentum. To me, the ordering of the movie is a lot like an under examined aspects of popular music. The sequencing of albums. One of the reasons I love Abbey road for example, one of the reasons I've listened to it so many times all the way through is because the song sequence carries me through even in the first half where there's no medley. The arrangement has thrust. I mean, just imagine the change in feeling. If the album began with say, maxwells silver hammer. Now imagine the change and feeling reservoir dogs began here. Sales when motherfuckers Kev is doing a job and take a big fat guess. Once on a team. The sequencing and reservoir dogs has the same natural rhythm as an album cycle does. Offering a variety in tempo from intense too reflective and back while linking corresponding scenes together. All Terentino's films are constructed this way, like albums, more like albums. I think that novels, even the ones with more straightforward narrative

Speaker 2:          04:13          black

Speaker 1:          04:18          coming up with an idea is to go through that record room and go through those records and to kind of find the music or the personality of a given movie. It's like I'm, I'm looking for the rhythm that this movie needs to play and I'm looking for the spirit and the rhythm that this movie needs to play it. The other thing that Tarantino is most known for is his dialogue and of course some of the references in reservoir dogs have an aged so well.

Speaker 2:          04:41          Well, you know, she looked like she looked like Christie love TV.

Speaker 1:          04:54          Oh yeah. Nobody today remembers the show get Christie love, but what's more important here is the concept. People still talk about TV shows. Entertainment is still a common language between strangers picking genre characters and genres situation. Alright. And giving them a real life spin have them sound like real people like me and my friends and just other people and make references that other people make of war dogs translates into 2017 because the humanity and the comedy that Tarantino breathed into genre films is still felt all over

Speaker 2:          05:28          footloose and in a great hero named Kevin Bacon

Speaker 1:          05:36          teaches an entire city full of people with sticks up their butts that dancing. So greatest thing there is I think the only context in which reservoir dogs has an age so well is within Terentino's own demography for all the purchase it has on film, culture and popular culture. It's still very clearly his most amateur movie. It's impossible to say how would be received today if it was released because so much of cinema in the past 25 years is influenced by the style. But I think siskel and Ebert got pretty close in their original reviews. I liked that movie as far as it went. I wanted it to go further and try more. I had the same reaction, Roger, that it was a lot of exercise in style, but then I got that really quick. I mean I understand what he's trying to do here, which is which is to show things in crime, movies that crime movies don't show, for example, the sloppiness, the humor, but we get that within 15 minutes.

Speaker 1:          06:31          The missing piece to reservoir dogs is the deeper character studies and exploration of big ideas that you get in pulp fiction and Jackie Brown, inglorious bastards and Django unchained. However, I do think that there is one point in reservoir dogs were Tarantino does reach for something deeper. The commode story sequence, all of Tarantino's work comments on the nature of storytelling itself, but the part when Mr Orange and undercover cop learns a fake story to sell the criminals on his credibility is one of the best instances of this in all his movies. He splits the sequence into four parts are in learning the scene, orange, rehearsing the scene, orange performing the story for an audience. Then finally the story coming alive. It's an elegant illustration of how words can transform into stories and stories into reality or into movies and it's a nice touch that the only thing that keeps the cops from noticing the drugs is the similar storytelling situation because stories can keep us from seeing reality too.

Speaker 2:          07:33          Buddy, I'm going to shoot you in the face if you don't put your hands on the dash

Speaker 1:          07:39          as an exercise in genre and style. Reservoir dogs is super one of the best in film and if it falls just short of the transcendent heights, that Tarantino would later go on to reach, but that's not really a criticism because I mean, let's see. You try to reach just short of transcendent with your first movie. I think a good rule of thumb for how well films have aged is simply whether or not we keep watching them. Twenty five years on. I'm still watching reservoir dogs and I'll bet that it'll still be true 25 years and more from that.
