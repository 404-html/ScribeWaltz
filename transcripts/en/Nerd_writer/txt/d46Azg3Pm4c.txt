Speaker 1:          00:19          As a filmmaker, Christopher Nolan always wants to walk a fine line if there's one fundamental theme that suffuses his entire filmography, it's that cinema as a shared narrative can be a hugely powerful cultural force. I'm far from the first to notice for mentioned that many of his films reference film itself that, for example, the inception team bears a strong resemblance to a film crew, but interestingly though, a lot of his work could be called Meta cinematic. Nolan is extremely careful about avoiding medicine amatic images in his work. For example, in the established Batman Continuity, Bruce Wayne and his parents are out to see the mask of Zorro film before the fateful double murder. That insights, the dark nights, whole saga in Batman begins, however, Nolan's retelling of that origin, the Wayne's are out to the opera Mephistopheles instead. That change is a purposeful one. As Nolan has said in an interview, we didn't have young Bruce Wayne going to see zero because it character in a movie.

Speaker 1:          01:28          Watching a movie is very different than a character in a comic book watching a movie, it creates a deconstructionist thing that we were trying to avoid. The reason Nolan tries to avoid this is because over and above everything, his cinema has always been about immersion, bringing you into a story so fully that the edges disappear and you're carried along by the narrative momentum. This is the line that Nolan wants to walk. He wants to be immersive and medicine and at the same time, in other words, he wants to hide in plain sight. Hiding in plain sight is essentially the subject matter of Nolan's fifth film and my favorite, the prestige. You could almost call this film Meta, Meta cinematic, and that it functions as a kind of rule book for how to achieve this immersive effect without seeming deconstructionist. To use Nolan's words, just take the first sequence.

Speaker 1:          02:26          The first thing you see is the film title over a mysterious shot of several mislaid top hats in the woods. The text here is, of course the title card, but if you know the film, you know that this text also has a literal function because these hats are the prestige of the prestige itself. The second clue is in their number doubles, copies, multiplicity. It's the key to understanding the tricks of this film, and this is echoed in the second shot as well with bird cages of identical canaries from here, Michael Caine's character goes onto describe how a magic trick works. It'd be magic trick consists of three poles, the pledge, the turn, and finally the prestige. The sequence carefully sets up the films own pledges that is borden and Angie are played by Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman respectively while illustrating it's method through Michael Caine's voiceover and his trick for the little girl, but the film is playing its own tricks here through editing.

Speaker 1:          03:30          Where is this voiceover coming from? Usually in film a voiceover mean someone commenting on the events being shown from sometime in the future and when the scene ends, it cuts to the courtroom scene of borden's murder trial. Picking up the last phrase, as if Michael Caine's whole explanation was testimony. It's not until the very end of the film that we learned that the bird trick with the girl is chronologically. The last moment in the film, Nolan reverses the temporal relationship between the voiceover and the scene under it, and this kind of displacement is the key mechanism for the whole movie. The Prestige is all about a trick that moves its object through time and space instantaneously. Well, this is exactly what all film editing does. Most of editing cuts between short distances and continuous times. Indeed with a simple cut that's what most people expect, but that seems simple.

Speaker 1:          04:24          Cut can traverse great distances also and great lengths of time in either direction. Nolan has described learning the power of this by watching terrence Malik's, the thin red line in which Malik cuts to memories simply without blurs or fades or wavy lines, and the powerful effect this can have on a viewer. The Prestige exploits this power to the extreme cutting between multiple different nested memories. Nolan sets up this device with board and an engineer's respective journals, but once these devices are established, he cuts between the narratives at will and without warning. In this way, the prestige demonstrates a unique capacity of film without compromising the audience's suspended disbelief. The complex narrative structure is totally subservient to the story Nolan wants to tell. It's necessary to keep its twists secret until the film wants to reveal them. This is Christopher Nolan's great gift as a filmmaker. He's so intune with the dynamics of film narrative, but he can construct a plot with so much forward momentum that even when he gives you all the clues, you remain at his mercy until the very final shot. Now, if this was the only lesson of the prestige, I'd be satisfied and calling it a great film, but there's one scene here easily missed that adds a final important point. I think

Speaker 1:          05:58          it's fine. You can watch the prestige and enjoy the story for what it is. That's what Nolan wants for us. He wants us to be amazed and as the film itself says, most of us want to be fooled, but all films, even one as tightly wellmed as this invite a probing. I, as the boy sees into the bird trick we can see into cinema and we're accustomed to taking most editing for granted, but the way stories are told, the tools of any storytelling medium in large part determined the way we construct our own memories, shared or personal. This is all to say that studying film doesn't kill it's magic. It feeds that magic back

Speaker 2:          06:52          into the real world.
