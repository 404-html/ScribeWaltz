Speaker 1:          00:03          Okay, let's clear something up. The enemy ghost in the shell from 1995 and the live action ghost in the shell from earlier this year are not the same movie. They're both adopted from the same universe, originally created in the Manga by have mooney sheer route, but they pulled from different parts of that universe. Unfortunately, the popularity of the 1995 animated features seems to have convinced someone that it was a good idea to graft images and sequences from that movie onto a completely different story.

Speaker 1:          00:39          Don't get me wrong, I like images as much as the next guy, but the ones in ghost in the shell 2017 don't really do it any favors. The evocative colors in sharp contrast to the anime are replaced by drab dark talents that are often hard to make out that sure animation is more likely to have crispr lines of contrast, but the live action movie not only fails to recreate the beauty of its predecessor, it fails to understand the purpose of that. But take a look at these two shots. How does each make you feel? Okay. For me, the one on the left draws my attention to the bed. It's the brightest part of an otherwise pretty uniformly colored frank. If you blurt it out like this, you can see that there is virtually no contrast between the interior walls of the apartment and the cityscape through the window.

Speaker 1:          01:24          It makes for a blend bluish composition that doesn't ask you for any further consideration. Or what about this one? Well, the immediately recognizable difference is the light source. Instead of coming from the bed, the light comes from the window and it's blown out so much that it creates this frame within a frame effect that trout to the apartment and leaves the major in Silhouette. There's great contrast here, but the purpose of the contrast is more important. It's almost as if the major shape is cut out of the city itself. In a video I made a couple of years ago, I spoke about how the 1995 anamae explores the relationship between city and person. It uses a futuristic, pluralistic, dynamic Hong Kong to interrogate what it means to build a personal identity in the age of sidewalks. It does this by visually framing characters in relation to the city around them and by giving us time to contemplate the space where the story takes place, most notably in a three and a half minute meditative sequence that allows us to simply look at the city.

Speaker 1:          02:20          It's funny that the live action movie ads 20 more minutes of runtime, but can't find any time for something like this. In fact, for all the cool visuals that boasts, there is really no city at all in this movie. Just a digital canvas to show off. Cyber punkish affects the way ghost in the shell. Twenty 17 one says to see the city is in these elaborate soaring shots that move and glide through the holographic buildings, but actual people don't see the city that way. One of the things that 2017 helped me to realize is that every shot in the montage from the anime is from the perspective of human beings. The camera is placed only where could actually stand or sit or gaze out of a window. That's how you build a sense of place. Not like this. In fact, you can learn a lot about what makes the anime so great by watching the live action ghost in the shell. Let's take a look at this sequence. For example, one of my favorite from the original story of the garbage man in the enemy. We get to spend three or four minutes with this guy and his coworker as they work and chat. He explains that his estranged wife won't let him see his daughter, so he's hacking into her mind to find out why she's doing this. He even chose this colleague, a picture of his daughter, but

Speaker 2:          03:33          he doesn't really care. She's my beautiful, precious angel. See gannaway. I'm not interested in crap like that. In the 2017 version we get this. You want me to pay for violin too? Don't get me. I love that 50 patients I do because she's amazing, but when she practices the thing is painful, right? Why not piano?

Speaker 1:          03:57          That was 14 seconds. You don't see these guys doing their job. You don't get any conversation. In 14 seconds, their minds are hacked and they become zombies. After this, they staged the iconic fight scene from the enemy in the water in front of the city. It's virtually a shot for shot remake with a few differences like these beautiful science versus these beige buildings or this red shirt as a point of focus versus this beige overcoat or even this little smile, a man momentarily in awe of his city. A brief moment like that can add so much, but ghost in the shell. 20 17 never has time for them. Finally, we get to the tragic moment when the garbage man learns that he's been fooled, that all his memories of his daughter or fake implanted by a hacker. The live action version shoots this in a weird glass box with a man.

Speaker 1:          04:46          We've spent 14 seconds with cutting all over the place. The enemy takes this moment largely in one shot, garbage man in the harsh, overexposed light of the truth. The man doesn't believe it with a cop brings out the man's photograph and asks him what he sees. I had a picture of her. She was there. She was smiling like an angel. I'm sorry to put you through this. Now. Come on, who do you see in the Nma? We get this tragic little arc, one that echos the larger themes of the film and it's sequenced brilliantly following. This is the scuba diving scene where major ruminates on her own identity and following that is the montage I mentioned before where we get to ruminate, where the ideas from both scenes compound and reverberate across the city. In the live action movie, the character is a throwaway. The scene is disconnected.

Speaker 1:          05:42          The scuba diving seen as isolated as well elsewhere in the movie at any time. For us to dwell on these ideas is nonexistent. The worst part about it is that the story ghost in the shell 2017 once to tell is actually really good. It's from a part of the TV series, the standalone complex, and it features the Revolutionary Qusay here played by Michael Pitt whose backstory is tragic and whose ideology is profound. We don't get to explore any of that because 2017 is busy trying to accommodate two stories. There were interesting things about both, but we get nothing but the surface level of either those who adapt works of art should be given the creative license to make the story work for them, but you can't just mind the source material for parts, adaptations and remakes, don't require strict adherence or obedience or even necessarily respect just an understanding of what made the original so powerful in the first place.
