Speaker 1:          00:01          Apple Needs Samsung, let me put that another way. Apple needs someone to manufacture the oled screens on it's brand new, flagship smartphone, the iphone 10 and Samsung. It's biggest smartphone competitor is the only company that can do it. If you're wondering how Samsung stock price could look like this in a year when the company had to replace them, fully recall and exploding phone in a year when it's defacto. Chief Executive was sentenced to five years in jail for bribery and embezzlement. This is how most people know Samsung as the company that sells them smartphones and tvs, even refrigerators, but the strongest part of its business is actually the components it builds for other companies, namely memory chips and displays like the old display that's going into the iphone 10 in these two key divisions. Samsung has the ability to supply products quickly to meet a Gargantuan worldwide demand. The name of the game is market share that they of course supply their own devices with these components, but they want everyone else to turn to them too and they're investing heavily, almost $19,000,000,000 on new plants in the next four years to grab a bigger slice of that pie.

Speaker 1:          01:09          In July of this year, Samsung overtook Intel as the world's number one chip maker and their dominance and owlette is even more extreme. As of the beginning of 2017, Samsung had over 90 percent of the market share, basically a monopoly, which means when demand for Olin grows like it has with the iphone. Samsung groves to apple, you might guess hates the situation because Samsung is the only old lead maker in the world who can handle the demand for new iphones. Samsung gets to set the price for reference. Kgi Securities estimates that Samsung will charge apple around 120 to $130 for each oled screen compared to old lcd screens which only cost apple about 45 to $55 and this may be a contributor to the hefty $1,000 price tag on the iphone 10. This sort of thing has to, especially Tim Cook, Apple Ceo Cooks, expertise is in supply chain in the process of how products get made and distributed to customers and when he joined apple in 1998, he was instrumental in overhauling the supply chain and making it the most efficient in the world.

Speaker 1:          02:11          One of the ways apple does this is by outsourcing pretty much all of its production to suppliers mostly in Asia who compete for their business, but in the case of oled screens, apple has no other choice but to go with Samsung. Apple wanted 80 million oled screens just for the second half of 2017. No one else can do that. Samsung barely has the capacity, which is one of the reasons why the iphone 10 comes out six weeks later than the iphone eight in order to bring its own lead costs down. Apple needs for there to be a serious competitor in this space, which is why it's investing two point $7,000,000,000 in LG display. Basically a massive cash advance for them to build up their capacity. Google has the same idea. It's investing $880 million dollars in to lg to break the Samsung monopoly for the near future, though it doesn't quite matter, Samsung is likely to be the major beneficiary of apple's lead needs, at least through 2019.

Speaker 1:          03:02          Not to mention that we'll also be making a huge number of theories. Chips for apple to know. It's one of the strangest relationships in business. Apple and Samsung have been feuding for years ever since 2010 when Samsung essentially copied the iphone with their galaxy s smartphone. The two companies have been locked in illegal war for almost seven years. That has cost Samsung $150, million dollars and maybe more. In the end, it seems silly because apple is still shelling out millions upon millions to its archrival for parts bolstering Samsung's huge profits and its growth. The iphone x is sort of the perfect symbol for the whole messy relationship and it captures how the tech business works at the very highest level. It's dysfunctional marriages like this. Apple Needs Samsung. Yeah, but Samsung is certainly profiting from the business. In other words, these two mega companies really need each other.
