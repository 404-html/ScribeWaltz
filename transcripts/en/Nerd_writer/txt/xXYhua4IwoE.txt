Speaker 1:          00:16          History, emotional anxiety, anxiety about emotions and thinkers from the classical period to the modern have pitted emotion against reason as opposing forces vying for the minds, control and emotional person was seen as weak, giving into the path of least resistance to base desires ruled by capricious feelings. Q is the path to the dark side. Strong on the other hand, would rule their emotions with reason. Everyone feels pressure. Winners don't let it show. Disney personified this struggle in a short eight minute cartoon from 1943 called aptly reason and emotion within each of us. These two wages ceaseless back from mastering the short is a lightly disguised propaganda piece, heartening Americans against fear tactics used by the axis powers in World War II, but it was nonetheless a point of reference for the Pixar team, led by director Pete doctor responsible for the film inside out. Doctors. Film is a far more nuanced take on the inner workings of the mind, appropriate for a post 40 and post cultural revolution age when we're encouraged extensively at least to embrace emotions rather than urged to masterman.

Speaker 1:          01:31          The film tells the story of the 11 year old Riley as she navigates a move across the country and more centrally, how five emotions, joy, the leader sadness, fear, disgust, and anger balanced the control of her mind from a mission control like headquarters in this model, each day consists of discrete moments colored by one of the five emotions which are sent during sleep to a vast archive of longterm memories, very rarely inexperienced is so formative that it creates a core memory which goes on to form the basis of Riley's personality, imagined as themed Park Islands when joy and sadness are accidentally injected from headquarters. The film chronicles their Cathartic journey through several other mental regions, including imagination land, a dream production company that looks like the paramount lot abstract thought and a subconscious jail. The Catharsis comes when joy realizes that sadness is not only useful but essential, perhaps even more essential than she is to Riley's harmonious, mental functioning and overall happiness.

Speaker 1:          02:37          The film itself and its message to embrace sadness, to feel what needs feeling is surely a token of progress against our long standing emotional anxiety, but is this model of the mind and its emotions and accurate one inside out basis. It's theory of emotions in large part on the work of Paul Ekman and influential scientists in the psychology of emotion, Ekman posits that there are seven basic emotions with universal facial signals. The ones featured in the film plus two that were cut, surprise and content. These basic emotions are ubiquitous. The world over Eckman says, and can be read on the faces of anyone, whether that's by an astute listener or facial recognition. Software like those Ekman has helped develop controversially for security and marketing uses. Ekman and other consultants on the film have praised inside out for providing a model for kids that is engaging as well as scientifically sound, but the edmunds model may be the dominant one in the psychology of emotion.

Speaker 1:          03:40          Right now, it's by no means the only indeed the field is a far more fractious one than the film scientific consultants lead on inside out seems to suggest that a child's experiences will be defined by whichever emotion is at the health. What's more that overall personality determined by colored core memories has an emotional driver. This model stands opposite to the key insights of psychoanalysis, for example, which hold that emotions can be transferred, transformed or distorted expressions of unconscious ideas and repressed experiences. In other words, feelings of sadness or joy or fear are frequently far removed from their causes. Understanding them as specific entities is troublesome because they're often not what they seem to be, which is to say that understanding of motion as the driver and not the expression of ideas and experience may ignore underlying causes. Indeed, the idea that emotions or memories can be separate or discrete in any way is a dubious one.

Speaker 1:          04:43          The film itself begins to challenge this at the end when the control panel in headquarters is expanded to fit all the emotions and when the memory orb start to reflect mixed experience, but a sense that experience can be quantified, pervades the film and like anything that may reflect more about our culture at the moment than the science itself for joy and sadness. The scariest place in the film isn't the subconscious prison that houses Riley's worst fears, but a giant pit in the center of Riley's mine where memories are forgotten forever without any hope of recall in an increasingly data driven culture where more data equals more truth. The greatest anxiety of all is the loss of information and the headquarters of Riley's. Mine does feel a bit managerial with its control panel and user manuals and Riley, a bit like an automaton controlled by a highly sophisticated technocratic operation. The decision making process is a bit wonky to since the latest neuroscience tells us that the frontal lobe and Max kind of executive function that mediates between the emotions and the limbic system and higher cognitive functions like reflection and critical thinking. Obviously not always in favor of the. Maybe

Speaker 2:          05:58          at this point you're saying the same thing as the voice. In my own head, it's a kid's movie. It's a comedy and that's very true, and the director, Pete doctor, has never held this film up

Speaker 1:          06:08          as an academic or therapeutic tool. He admits the need for poetic and comedic license to adding an executive function like the kind of just mentioned, for example, would no doubt make the film too complex, as with any number of other things like the two basic emotions he left out or any other emotion, I don't think his dramatic instincts can be questioned here under the premises of the emotional model that inside out presents the narrative unfolds with grace, subtle, deep and intense poignancy. I'll leave the formal critique to someone else, but there's no doubt that this is masterful filmmaking. I had the tiers to prove it, but it does raise questions about the effect of popular models of the mind. Pixar tell stories so mythic and archetipal and so well that it's all but impossible not to internalize some of their elements, especially for kids. If the result is that children learn earlier and better why it's important to accept and expect sadness, then I think it's unquestionably a good thing, but sadness and joy and fear and disgust and anger are not discrete things or self contained or even fully internal.

Speaker 1:          07:20          Neither are personality traits or for that matter personalities, any model of emotion is going to reflect a split between biology and culture, between neuroscience and theoretical psychoanalysis. Don't let anyone tell you that that debate has been decided one way or the other. There are as many emotional theories as there are emotional psychologists. What's interesting and ironic about inside out is that Riley may come off as a bit robotic, but a more complex and complete framework for the inner workings of the mind can be found. Enjoy herself. A character who questions and reflects who turns inward not to another smaller headquarters, but a cauldron of indistinct compounds of feeling influenced by chemistry situation and other people inside out may not be perfectly accurate, but the film inspires something more important than that. Something that doesn't require scientific exactness, emotional intelligence.

Speaker 2:          08:30          It is a sunny day outside right now. Hey everybody, thanks for watching. I'm, I love Pixar generally, but I love this movie just because it gives you so much to dig into an explorer and I had a lot of fun making this and putting this together. Um, if you think that the nerd writer and what I'm doing here is something that you're not seeing elsewhere on youtube, you can pledge little to my channel by clicking here and going to my patriots what funds this project and helps me improve the quality. There's so much more I want to do. There's more series that I'm going to be introducing soon. And the funding is what makes it possible. I mean that. That's the unique relationship between you and me. There's nothing in between us and what you give me. The money you give me helps me to make this project better and more in depth. And I hope that you trust that I will do that by, by the quality of the content that I've made so far. So thank you so much again for watching and I'll see you guys next Wednesday.
