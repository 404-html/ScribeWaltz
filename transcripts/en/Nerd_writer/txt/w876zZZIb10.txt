Speaker 1:          00:04          It's likely that by now you've heard about movie pass, the subscription service that allows you to see one movie per day in theaters for $9, 95 a month, except you can't see it will be more than once. You have to be a hundred yards from the theater to book the ticket and during certain times you have to pay a little extra, but despite all that movie pass is still a pretty good deal. In fact, the deal might be too good for moving past, just as you've probably heard about movie pass, you've probably also heard the company is losing money faster than a Tarantino. Henchmen loses blood. The problem is simple. Movie past charges nine 95 a month, and the average movie ticket and America costs $9 and sixteen cents. When you see a movie with movie pass, they pay the full price of the ticket as if they were buying a normal ticket for a friend.

Speaker 1:          00:44          That means if you see just two movies a month, movie passes losing double what a gains from you more. If you're buying in a city where ticket prices are more expensive, multiply that by $3, million friends and you can see why movie pass is in a lot of trouble financially according to the best estimates. The average movie pass subscriber sees about one point five movies a month and even though that's not three movies or even to the numbers are still lopsided and that point five of a movie is bleeding them dry. In 2017, the company that owns movie pass, Helios and Matheson lost a $150 million dollars and in May the company revealed in an sec filing that it's losing 21 point $7,000,000 per month on average at that time and at that rate they only had enough cash available to stay solvent for two more months.

Speaker 1:          01:31          It's two months later now and well, the website still works, so that's a good sign. If you're consistently losing money as a business, there's only one way to stay afloat by finding investors to give you money in the hope that some day you'll be profitable in the future. Investors investing in spotify or uber or dropbox or blue apron, all companies that have yet to become profitable, in fact of the 108 companies that went public in 2017, over three quarters weren't profitable. Now not all unprofitable companies are created equal. Amazon was unprofitable for years, but it had the revenue so it was just putting them back into investments. In the case of movie pass, the revenue just isn't enough to pay for the costs and movie past says it, understands this. It says it always knew it was going to lose money on its path to acquiring more subscribers and greater market share.

Speaker 1:          02:24          And to be fair, the growth of the company has been impressive. Last August movie pass only had 20,000 subscribers when they lowered their price to $10 a month, almost a year later and they're approaching $3 million with projections of up to 5 million by the end of the year. The theory behind the price drop and the reason they haven't yet raised it substantially to stem their losses is that it's supposed to attract the 51 percent of movie goers who only see about three to six movies a year. People who might pass on $20 or even $15 but can't resist 10 these people, the theory goes, we'll bring the average movie per subscriber down, but movie pass needs to look for cash and other places to. The original idea was that it could use the app to track the movie going habits of its users and sell that data to studios for targeted advertising and to restaurants nearby the theater who could advertise to customers when they're in the area. Movie pass, things that eventually if it can grow enough, it can negotiate a percentage of the new business. It's bringing two theaters and the surrounding stores. It thinks that it could potentially even get a slice of a theaters only real moneymaker concessions. Let's see what the CEO of America's largest theater chain has to say about that.

Speaker 2:          03:37          Absolutely no intention, no intention of sharing any of our admissions revenue or concession. Terrific Bitch. Okay. I added that last part. It was good to get to it.

Speaker 1:          03:47          Sure. There are a lot of forces at work in the movie theater ecosystem and movie pass is laying them all bear. People are seeing fewer movies overall, so theater chains have been raising ticket prices and higher ticket prices means people see fewer movies still and don't take chances on what they do see at theaters have it hard as it is. Most ticket revenues get kicked back to the studios who leveraged their power to get even more percentage and now here comes the subscription service, the valuing the price of a ticket in the minds of consumers asking for a cut of concessions and yet movie pass is bringing them business. It's users are taking chances. Again, seeing movies on a whim. Again, it's bringing more people to the movies more often. It's just not bringing enough people. Not yet.

Speaker 1:          04:38          The studios don't want to pay for the data. The theaters don't want to cut them in and movie pass subscribers are just seeing too many movies. If there's a size at which this would all change, 20 million subscribers maybe or 50 million or 100, I don't know, but it's a race now can move you past, get to that critical size before it runs completely out of money. I guess we'll see. Until then. It is genuinely one of the best deals in town. Something I thought I'd never see a bunch of rich investors taking millions of people out to the movies.

Speaker 1:          05:16          Everybody. Thank you so much for watching. This episode was brought to you by skillshare and online learning community for creators, but more than 18,000 classes and everything from graphic design to film editing, finance it security. You know, when I learned photoshop, I learned it through this mishmash of disconnected youtube videos and I think the process would have gone a lot faster if there was a class dedicated to teaching me everything about that program in a systematic way. Learning new skills is really valuable to me because whenever I learn a new skill, it's like a bunch of new ideas are suddenly unlocked in my head. I think, what can I do with this and that. Always always helps me with writer's block. A premium membership begins around $10 a month for unlimited access to all courses, but the first 500 people to sign up using the link in the description below will get their first two months for free, and those two months you could easily learn the skills you need to start a new hobby or business. More importantly, the skills you learn will help give you the ideas for what that business or our project could be. Definitely try it out. Thanks guys. I'll see you next time.
