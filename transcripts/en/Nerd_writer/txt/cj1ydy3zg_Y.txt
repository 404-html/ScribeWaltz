Speaker 1:          00:00          Coffee on the Tuesday and blog eight.

Speaker 2:          00:03          Right.

Speaker 1:          00:14          So Halloween was yesterday and the weekend was a whole lot of fun. My friends had a lot of cool costumes to it. I love that. You know, I have friends who put a lot of work into it because just makes the holiday fucking awesome. I'm actually going to put these down because it's a little bit dangerous to have adamantium near a computer screen. So before we get to the main event, this luggage, when I mentioned for a moment what I did last night for actual Halloween, I actually got the chance to see one of my heroes last night in concert, the author Neil Gaiman at the theater on. We'll show you haven't read anything by Neil Gaiman. Start doing that right now and if you ever get the chance to hear him read live in concert, just buy the ticket. Don't even think about it. Performed with his wife, Amanda Palmer of the Dresden dolls. I never was too much interim music, but to hear her live a was breathtaking. After the show, they came up to sign autographs and by some weird turn of luck they just started the line right where we were standing, so I got a chance to shake meals hand and just extend my thanks for everything. Unfortunately, I don't have any video that. Oh wait a second.

Speaker 3:          01:03          Ah,

Speaker 1:          01:06          proof just goes to show how many times I wear a pair of jeans. Okay. Let's get to the main event of this blog, which my friends do a web series and sketch comedy shorts called the Burns Worth Saturdays, so in honor of Halloween they did a short film called Pten. Larry go to the haunted hotel and rented out a room at the beautiful Langham Hotel in Pasadena and film there for about 12 hours. About a week ago was primarily my friends Steven's project and I helped out as much as I could do. I wanted to film some behind the scenes footage that I could put it on this blog and show you what it's like to make a film over a full day. Without any further ado, here it is. The making of Pete and Larry at the haunted hotel. What are we do? What are you doing?

Speaker 4:          01:41          I want it to be static. I mean, what are you doing right now? Nothing. Get that fucking cocaine that you guys should both freeze frame, like not an actual person, but you guys are just not moving and I'm going to stop. So yeah, like I kind of punch you out. I finish up my pine tonight. I'm just standing there like this and see if it goes. Oh hell Larry. Alright. We'll see what they have on the door. Bit looked so sloppy. I really think that if it's. If we look at the same time, that's the only way it's gonna work. What seems to be a serious problem? You got a major problem was that it's filthy in here. My brother is having a conference, the keynote speaker at the [inaudible] conference, so I suggested come in, come in to me like we're hugging. They put it in the eight. So where are we in the filming of the movie yet? The second set of day I watched, I watched the dark night again, thinking you guys are insane because it's just on a whole nother level. Even with Heath Ledger, it's just a whole nother level of moving from that navigant.

Speaker 5:          03:07          You're saying that you think we're insane thing that that begins is better than dark night? Absolutely. When the truth is found to be lies.

Speaker 4:          03:26          Wow. That's all I got for that. Woo Woo. Oh, cool. Good shots. It's just one single family. There's a lot more than covering that's happening in the shots that the problem is. This whole scene just keeps going. Action. No one look at me. Oh, from what? No, somebody else. Yeah, it's too bad. Well, that's something where it's needed. God. Larry King of haunted hotel, which is what we're filming right now. Indeed. Our. And you just turn your head gear head on top of mind. Yeah, that's fine. Yeah. Yeah. That sounds fair enough. Yet what's wrong?

Speaker 5:          05:54          So there you go. That's about 12 hours of film, a condensed into four minutes. Check

Speaker 1:          05:57          for the link of that short film and the rest of the Saturdays in the dubliner. I also want to say that I'm really proud of my friend Steven and all my friends were continuing to make things. You know, they want to do it for a living, but I think it's important that everybody does that. Everybody makes things, whether it be a comedy short, a dramatic show, a painting, a book, a song, Nsx sculpture or dance, a show what as important that no matter who you are, no matter what you do for a living, that you take some time to make something that has no other purpose besides itself. It's important to tell about our souls so that when people watch the things we make or read the things we make or listen to, the things we make, they can know who we are.
