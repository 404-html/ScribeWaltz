Speaker 1:          00:00          Congrats to the Baltimore Ravens, you guys suck, but you want a coffee or a Tuesday and Vlog 48.

Speaker 1:          00:17          So when I finished the sixth grade and was ready to make the big move, did junior high. My parents said, you know, Evan, elementary school was easy, but next year junior high, it's not going to be so easy. Next year is going to be hot, so I steeled my 11 year old self and brace for junior high with a certain figure and expectation that life has so far been a light breeze, but now that was over there was going to be a certain fundamental change and things in that change would be for the worse. Well, seventh grade came in, seventh grade went and when I opened my eyes, everything was still pretty simple and pretty easy. Things really hadn't changed that summer. My parents said, you know, Evan, seventh grade was easy, but eighth grade, whoa, things are going to get serious now. Get ready. Eighth grade came and went that summer.

Speaker 1:          00:58          My parents warned me about high school, but by that time I had come to believe that they were pretty unreliable sources in this particular field. Nonetheless, they kept saying so every year through high school and college and every year I couldn't help but almost believed them, but every year they were wrong. Now, to be very clear, I am not implying in any way that I'm gifted or smarter than the average person. The whole point of the nerd writer is that I'm not, but I never did do much work in school. I never did try very hard. I found despite my parents' warnings, that I didn't need to. I often joke with friends that in school I studied the teachers and not the subjects and it's true. If I deconstructed the personalities of the great givers of how they were to test and awarded points, I could construct my own personality and word my own answers in a way that was complimentary and that's how I got through.

Speaker 1:          01:46          I think I saw even at a young age that reality was fluid. It was in constant, which made it flexible. A huge number of the rules of society were convention. They were as alterable as people were persuadable at the risk of self psychoanalysis. I think this comes in large part from my dad who is in a word in cordial. He's a born Hagler, unwilling to believe that something can't be done until these strided himself. It's a great quality, but enough about me. Is this just all in my head or is there some truth to this id? Well, in the end, what we're really talking about is evolution. We're talking about intuition, reason morality. We're talking about the way people were early in Plato's Republic, a dialogue about justice and the perfect society. The precocious young glaucon puts a question to socrates worded in the popular, would you rather style it's this?

Speaker 1:          02:35          Would you rather be an honest and fair person and have everyone believe that you're a liar and the Douche bag, or would you rather be a liar and a douchebag and have everyone believed that you're a fair and honest and wonderful person? Now it's Plato's prerogative to prove to glaucon that being good is better than seeming good. That our minds are perfect reasoning machines meant to find truth and master the lowly passions despite the reputational costs, and that in truth is happiness. Glaucon like a good little bitch is eventually brought around, but to be fair, socrates is a master debater and what he's saying sounds good, but the reality of humanity is somewhat different than Plato's idea of the truth about us is that our minds are less equipped for reasoning than they are for justification. A number of studies by moral psychologist Robert Howard Margolis and Jonathan Haidt show us that intuitions and emotions rule that when in contact with anything we react instantaneously for or against that thing, and our reason goes to work, looking not for the truth, but for a way to justify what we've already decided.

Speaker 1:          03:41          Ever try telling someone they're wrong about something flat out well. Your tone has already defeated. Your purpose of that person senses confrontation. Their whole being will turn away from you, the smart little politician in their head. The reason that Plato imagines is working to find the truth instead goes to work. Finding the reasons why your wrong. We've evolved to become outstandingly adept at justifying our intuitions and it explains a lot why we argue when we're wrong, why we forgive good looking people their flaws and vice versa, why we lie and omit and carefully carved the versions of ourselves that we show to others. Simply the evolutionary advantages of discovering the truth are less than the evolutionary advantages of having a good reputation glaucon, who in the end would rather be a liar that everyone likes has got us pinned more accurately than even the great plato.

Speaker 1:          04:30          To know these things gives one a great power. You're likely to get more out of life if like my dad, you haggle with reality, addressing someone's intuitions or emotions will more readily yield the results that you want from them. People are fluid. Reality is people. Reality is fluid. There is an insidious side to this and I think you could hear it. Essentially, we are made to be manipulated and there's no shortage of that. Of course, in human history, probably in your personal history too, but along with our intuitive desire to get what we want, we are also guided by the intuitive aversion to harm our reasoning. Faculty is not a slave to our emotions, but a politician and the best politicians like the best people can navigate a fluid reality of flexible rules seeking, ever subtler ways not to harm the people they share the world with. And you know what harms people manipulation.

Speaker 2:          05:33          Hey everybody, thanks for watching. Don't forget to follow me on twitter and tumbler links in the description. Also, if you want to read more about moral psychology, I highly recommend the righteous mind by Jonathan Haidt is, it's a great book, extremely well written, uh, and you'll learn a little bit more about why we think the way we think. Um, so read that and I will see you next time.
