Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:05          how do you change an entire industry for Jeff Bezos and his new grocery store of the future? Amazon go. It's a three part process in no particular order. Part one, make a video with over 7 million views. Amazon's youtube video is a bit of Utopian science fiction, a vision for what the future of grocery shopping could look like and almost completely frictionless consumer experience in which you walk in, grab what you want and go. The marketing here is extremely important. I think. Notice that Amazon drop this video like beyonce drops a surprise album and they made sure to disable the comments and declined to take questions about the concept from journalists for the time being. I think the point is to let the idea gestate in the public's mind, letting us internalize the ease and stress free environment of our future grocery stores. This internalization that hope goes will flower into an expectation and expectation is a very powerful force that can move markets.

Speaker 2:          01:05          This potential for change is crucial for the second important thing part to get the patents in 2013 and 2014. Amazon filed two patents that describe most of the advanced technology we're seeing inside the Amazon go store. The first call detecting item interaction and movement describes a system for tracking removal or placement of items at inventory locations, just like you saw on the video using a variety of sensors and cameras with object recognition software. The second expands on this concept covering the payment of items when you leave a designated area. Now, both these patents were filed primarily for use in Amazon's warehouses, but even then they were putting in little hints about their longer term goals. I think I don't see what you're doing. What are we doing? Part prove that once Amazon creates the expectation for a customer experience defined by technology that they own, the logical thing to do would be to start building the Amazon go stores.

Speaker 2:          02:06          You're likely to see Amazon start doing that once they fix all the bugs with their Beta location in Seattle, but I think this obscures the much bigger fish that Amazon is trying to catch here. To understand what I'm talking about, you have to look at another part of Amazon's business, Amazon web services. The massive cloud computing Juggernaut that as of 2016 is the most profitable segment of Amazon's entire business. Basically years ago, Amazon built an online infrastructure to host and organize its own site and then they realized that they could take this technology and license it to other companies from this. Amazon collects billions in fees. The Internet, as you know, it wouldn't exist without Amazon web services, Netflix, NASA, Reddit, the Obama campaign, pinterest and the CIA are all hosted on its servers and a lot more. It's a business that's growing fast and it's 10 times the size of its next 14 competitors combined.

Speaker 2:          03:07          It was Brian Romilly that payment's expert who pointed me in the direction of Amazon web services and and once you learn that business model, it's easy to predict where Amazon is heading. They want to combine their patents with marketing that creates this expectation of a frictionless shopping experience. Then they'll build a number of stores to prove the concept. By the time they have a few 100 and operation, the amount of refined targeted data that we'll be able to acquire on customers will make the model irresistible. Komodo, welcome back to the gap sort of tank tops for gap for you and that point Amazon just has to wait. Supermarket chains nowhere near capable of retrofitting their stores with this kind of tech will have one shiny place to turn for all their needs and just like it does with its web services. Amazon will license like crazy with their eyes toward dominating not just supermarkets, but the entire retail universe.

Speaker 2:          04:04          A $25,000,000,000,000 industry in the US alone. In other words, Amazon go is just, hey everybody, thanks for watching. Happy holidays. I hope that you're with people that you love. This holiday season.
