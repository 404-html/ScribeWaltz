Speaker 1:          00:05          Okay, what you're about to experience is shocking for them, a German term for taking pleasure in someone else's misfortune. Let's back up a bit.

Speaker 1:          00:20          There's a cottage industry around shopping online. It's why fail videos get tens of millions of views, and it's why there's so much fun to watch. Fail compilations are an evolution of things like jackass and the America's funniest home video format, which is really just a nonfiction version of the slapstick comedy that you see in the three stooges or Charlie Chaplin movies where Shakespeare's comedies going all the way back probably to the origin of laughter itself. Why do we feel this way? What makes us enjoy the pain of others? It comes down to identity and self esteem. Human society is defined by competition and comparison. When you see someone fail, your psyche is rewarded with a little boost. The feeling that you're better off than they are shopping for to is particularly strong wind. The failure in question is arrogant or deserving or even just to successful. That's why we delight when celebrities fall from grace.

Speaker 1:          01:12          It's why the downfall of super high achievers like tiger woods generates so much media attention in societies. These feelings extend to our groups. The more we identify with our Ingroup, like our favorite sports team, for example, the more susceptible we are to shot in Florida. When a rival team loses. Now in the realm of sports and people falling off, rope swings, feelings of shot and Florida are natural and innocent. Self esteem is not a steady thing. Fluctuates and if it fail, compilation makes you laugh. Why not? Were shot in Florida, I think becomes poisonous is in the universe of politics. I mean if Shoutin, Florida is a feature of ingroups and outgroups in competition, it should be no surprise that it festers in our political parties where the victory of one side almost always means a defeat of the other and studies on Shoutin, Florida in politics bear this out.

Speaker 1:          02:02          Intensity of party affiliation strongly predicts whether events produce shot in Florida in their members when the Republican party missteps or one of its members commits a gaffe. Democrats report feelings of shopping for them and vice versa. What complicates things is that politics involves the wellbeing and the suffering of millions of people. The failure of your opponent group can often spell objectively bad consequences for everybody, and yet the most disturbing finding of studies on Shodan 40 to in politics is that even in these cases, people report shouting for that as long as their opponents lose out. Scary as that is, you can take solace in the fact that most people understand that these feelings are socially inappropriate, which is why they're felt that not really spoken about studies. Bear this out to those who report feelings of Shodan for at objectively bad news like an economic downturn hurting the opposing party are also deeply ambivalent about just having that emotion or at least they to be.

Speaker 1:          03:00          All I did is point out the fact that on the cover of the national enquirer, there's a picture of him and crazy Lee Harvey Oswald having breakfast now. 10 never denied that it was his father. One of the things that troubled me about the 2016 election was the presence of Shodan Freida among Democrats and opponents of Donald Trump. He seemed to free people up somehow, and I think it's because ambivalence about shotgun Florida in politics is a result of the fact that on some level we believe our opponent group is genuinely trying to help. We're just going about it the wrong way. Trump, on the other hand is so cartoonish, so nakedly selfserving that any reservations people might have about basking in his blunders just evaporated. Donald trump is the perfect figure for Shotgun Florida. He checks every box arrogant, successful, deserving. What's more, he openly participates in it himself. It's Rubio,

Speaker 2:          03:58          right?

Speaker 1:          04:01          I offered the opportunity for guilt free shot in Florida, and this is what troubles me because it was natural for trump supporters to take pleasure in his candidacy, but what I saw all around me was his opponents feeling the same way. For many, it was just as enjoyable as watching a fail compilation video. Seeing him make appalling comment after appalling common at the start when he was a joke, there seemed to be a little harm and expressing the shotgun Florida, but there was an effect because the news media registered this feeling as interest and as a result gave an enormously lopsided amount of media coverage to his campaign, which may trump the focus of everything. It may be the first time in US history that collective shoutin Florida influenced a political outcome, and that's not a joke at all. Right now we're living through an intoxicating mixture of entertainment, politics, journalism, and shot in Florida.

Speaker 1:          04:56          It's a mixture that is unbelievably great for the news media and as trump is embroiled in the Russia investigation, the news media is showing its best side, but it's worth site two with each new revelation, each new bombshell report the Shazam for you to become stronger, and that incentive is impossible for media executives to resist. If trump goes down, it'll be met with alation from certain sectors of the public and who knows he may deserve it, but whatever happens with his presidency shot in Freud, it is a drug that we ought to keep in check because like any drug, a growing tolerance will eventually mean a growing desire for more of it more often, and that's not a force we want power in our politics.

Speaker 2:          05:44          Everybody.
