Speaker 1:          00:20          What's the scariest painting and Art History? There are some strong contenders, like the judgment of Kumbaya by Gerard divvied Hieronymus. Bosch is rendering the Henry Fuselli nightmare edvard moocs screen, but there's only ever really been one painting that has seriously disturbed me.

Speaker 1:          00:46          This one, Francisco Goya's, Saturn devouring his son. What you're seeing here is the legendary Spanish painters depiction of the Greek Titan cronus, who after usurping power from his father was told a prophecy that one of his own sons would do the same, and you serve him in order to prevent this. Every time his Queen Raya bore a child, kronis would eat it. Unfortunately for him in the end, ray conspired to hide away their youngest son, Zeus, who eventually fulfilled the prophecy, exiled his father and ended the reign of the titans. The story is a well known Greek myth, but look at how Goya handles it. Some key changes jump out right away. First, in the myth, cronus devours his children by swallowing them whole. In fact, they remain alive in his stomach. Goya's painting is a much more gruesome affair. He takes some inspiration here from Peter Paul Rubens, a flemish baroque painter who depicted the same event as well in Rubin, Saturn. The tightened seems to be sucking the life force from his child even for such a terrifying subject matter. Ruben's displays all the drama richness, even beauty that marks the baroque style. He helped to make famous

Speaker 1:          02:02          in Goias version. That beauty is gone. We're left with a frightened, crazed monster discovered in the dark as if by some explorer with a torch who wandered into the wrong cave. Saturn kronis his Roman name as already chewed off the head of his child is black mouth, opens around the elbow of the left arm, ready to bite it off. At the joint is angular. Body is crouching in an awkward position. His hands dig into the spine. Blood runs down his child's arm and neck and shoulder, a startling primary color, and if we take a closer look, we notice that this is not a child at all, but one of Saturn's kids grown up. There's something even more terrifying in knowing that the victim knew what was happening and tried to fight back, but what's most disturbing of all, I think is when and where this painting was found late in his life.

Speaker 1:          02:59          Francisco Goya purchased a house on the outskirts of Madrid called the Quinta Dale Sordo, or the villa of the deaf after its previous owner, and interesting coincidence since by that time in his life, Goya was deaf to his physical and mental health, declining. Goya painted. 14 murals often refer to as the black paintings directly onto the interior walls of his home. Saturn devouring his son was in the dining room. The photographs you're seeing now, we're taking over 50 years. After that time, Goya never mentioned the paintings himself. He never intended for anyone to see them. To this day, people still puzzle over the meaning of the black paintings. Why was Goya creating these pessimistic and fantastical scenes in the solitude of his home to understand this, it might help to go back through his career. He grew up in Zara, Goza, Spain, the fourth of six children in a lower middle class family.

Speaker 1:          03:56          By all accounts, he was a lighthearted and joyful kid as he studied painting in Zara, goes up, Madrid and Rome. His first serious job was at the royal tapestry factory where he created tapestry cartoons to adorn the palaces and stately homes of the city. These tapestries take their cue from the Rococo style, elegant, playful, light scenes of both nobility and peasantry, enjoying the normal activities of their day. Goya eventually became the court painter for King Charles the fourth, a disappointing monarch, unlike his father Charles, the third who was beloved by the people for enacting reforms that began to bring secular enlightenment values to Spain in 1793 and unknown

Speaker 2:          04:41          left Goya, yet though he still took emissions from his royal clientele. This disease was a dark time

Speaker 1:          04:47          turning point in his life and art. You can see it in yard with lunatics from 1794. Bodies Grapple and cry out in anguish. The difference between this and the tapestry cartoons is shocking. His hearing gone. Goya began to see the country around him with a grim clarity and a series of etchings called Los Capriccio or the caprices. He sends up a Spanish culture that is both tragic and comic, a student of the enlightenment himself. Goya sees the country backsliding on the road to maternity. The king is withdrawn and the people are superstitious, too stupid to know what they need. You can see him fusing all the corners of his imagination, the quest for anatomical truth, the need for social critique and an obsession with beasts and creatures. It's all summed up in this one. Aptly titled, the sleep of reason produces monsters. In the following years, things got worse for Spain.

Speaker 1:          05:47          Napoleon invaded the country and brutally massacred those who resisted his campaign. Goya was witnessed to the bloodshed and it affected him deeply. His painting on the subject, the third of May 18, oh, eight is a regulatory depiction of war, resistance and brutality. Before this war was a highly composed theatrical subject. In painting here, Goya gives nothing but brute force. It's emotion unmediated by artifice. It would be five years until Spain regained its thrown. In the interim, resistors developed the constitution of 18, 12, which called for liberal reforms like national sovereignty, freedom of the press and free enterprise, but on gaining power. The new King Ferdinand, the seventh squash the constitution right away and arrested those who made it Goya, withdrew disheartened the country which in his youth had reached toward a new world, was now swallowed again by autocracy, scarred by war, scarred by illness.

Speaker 1:          06:50          He began to paint nightmare scenes onto the walls of his home. In one, a young man is being eaten by the father. He was prophesied to you. Serve by now. Goya knows progress isn't assured, and when it's defeated, it's not painless, it's horrific and slow and the victim can feel it happening. There are a lot of ways that you can read Saturn devouring his son. Maybe Goya was trying to exercise the demons of his mind or the demons of his country, or maybe he was just trying to paint honestly about one terrifying facet of man's nature using the skills and techniques he learned in pioneered through a lifetime. The black paintings changed the history of art, but what's maybe scariest of all is that Goya didn't care. He doesn't care how we read this painting because he didn't paint it for us or for anyone. Saturn devouring his son exists beyond interpretation. It's brute force horror without mediation, a monster looking out from a dark wall in a dark room.
