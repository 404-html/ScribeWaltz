Speaker 1:          00:12          Here we are, everybody loves a good movie and the genre has a lot of competition. You've got John Hughes classics like the Breakfast Club and Ferris Bueller's day off nineties, teen romcoms like 10 things I hate about you and she's all that Richard Linklater is coming of age, comedy, dazed and confused or recent hits like the fault in our stars and love Simon. You could even throw all eight Harry Potter movies into the mix. Why not? But when I search [inaudible] dot com, which everybody knows is the authority on ranking stuff. I'm disappointed to find that my favorite teen movie doesn't even crack the top 100. Of course I'm talking about Kenji Ecosoc whose turn of the millennium masterpiece. That. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:55          Boy,

Speaker 1:          01:04          premise of battle royale is really simple. In a dystopian Japan, a classroom of teenagers is chosen every year and shipped to an island where they have to fight to the death until only one is left standing. You might recognize this premise from the hunger games books, the first of which came out eight years after battle royale and nine years after the book by cashew into Cami on which it's based. This concept is also the basis for the hugely popular video game, fortnight battle royale and its predecessor player unknown's battlegrounds, which was at least in part, inspired by Fuka sock who's moving. Unlike the hunger games, battle royale is remarkably contained. There is no larger world, no political intrigue, plotline. The audience is just dumped into this horrific situation with the characters and we experience it shocks as they do and they are shocked.

Speaker 1:          02:02          It's definitely a violent movie, but it's the execution of violence that makes battle royale so great. And this should come as no surprise though. I didn't know this when I first saw the movie at Summer Camp Age Sixteen. Battle Royale is the final film of Japanese alter Kinji Fuka soccer. He made this incredibly vigorous film about teenagers at age 70, which is amazing, but by then focus. Aco was a master, a criminally underappreciated master of Japanese in world cinema. He made his mark on the industry in the 19 seventies with a breathtaking series of films about Japanese gangsters, the Yakuza in the chaos after World War II. Unlike the more traditional Yakuza films, Fuka Socceroos movies have a wild manic energy to them. The camera work is designed to throw you into the action. It's a thrilling, disorienting experience to watch them and whose message in those films comes through loud and clear in a society by war, friendship, comradery. Even the famous codes of honor of the Coosa only stretch so far. It was truly every man for himself, and if someone could get an advantage by betraying his friend, he was more likely to do it than not. It took a sack whose films? The honorable ones are often the first to be killed.

Speaker 3:          03:21          Yeah, he killed him. Him have to be in a custody can you highlight one night every night

Speaker 1:          03:33          in battle royale, the same philosophy holds in the chaos of the game. The speed at which friends turn into enemies can give you whiplash and the violence, the violence of the films is sudden devastate. As a viewer, it's like you're one of the students. It all comes so fast at the beginning that you just want to pause and get a grip on things, but there's no time for them. The ones who trust too liberally are the ones who get killed. First, it may seem like battle royale is a fable of nihilism with mindless, brutal killing, doled out to anyone and everyone, but the violence in [inaudible] whose vision has a purpose, like all great team movies, Battle Royale is really about friendships that may be a little hard to see, but focus on who's interested in what friendship really means when the gloves are off in the most barbaric circumstances. What does human connection mean in the context of humanity's capacity for unspeakable violence? At that time, unspeakable violence was very much alive in the memory of the older generation in Japan. It tested them in ways that the younger generation couldn't begin to understand. This is what life was like for fruit soco himself when he was 15, the same age as the students in the film,

Speaker 2:          04:54          so you know, she, she, she was really not that much data on my level. You Eel know. I'm like, you want to look that up? So do you want your pillows

Speaker 1:          05:25          in the movie? It's almost as if the older generation represented by a teacher devices the game as a way to communicate their experiences with the youth and it's almost as if he made the film for the same reason. Battle Royale is interested in the kind of friendship that can't be explored at high school. It's friendship tainted by a deeply cruel world, but it's all the more poignant when it persists in spite of that fact. Well, Michael saw sick idea. It's about the last movie is a lot of things. It's Blackley comical. It's scary. It's a naked look at humanity and it's a gripping piece of balls to the wall. Entertainment directed by a man with a lifetime of skill and experience. It's a teen movie and it deserves to be considered with the very best of that genre.
