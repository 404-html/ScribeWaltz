Speaker 1:          00:08          I am not a destroyer of companies. I am a liberator up them.

Speaker 2:          00:16          The point is, ladies and gentlemen at Gree, for lack of a better word, is good. Greed is right. Greed works. Greed clarifies, cuts through and captures. Yes, I think evolutionary spirit in all of its forms, we'd for life, for money, for love. Knowledge has mark upward search of mankind in green. You mark my words will not only save till dark paper, but that other malfunctioning corporation called the USA. Thank you very much.

Speaker 1:          00:57          Despite this famous speech from Oliver Stone's Wallstreet, extolling the virtues of greed, excess and capitalist, no one could ever accuse stone or the film itself of doing the same thing. Indeed, it's because of Gordon Gekkos sermon that we know the opposite is true. If we're all greedy, we can win together. That's the essence of Geckos message. Of course, oliver stone and the rest of us know that in a connected capitalist society, greed always works at the expense of others and when later in the film we watch Bud Fox learn how Gecko plan to gain at the expense of his father. The moral hypocrisy of Gecko and the film central condemnation of capitalists excess is laid bare, but that was then, and this

Speaker 3:          01:47          I think I was asked, is the omen. I keep it on it like the Romans three pitches where the child is. We live in the moment

Speaker 1:          02:02          26 years after Oliver Stone Wall Street, Martin Scorsese gives us the wolf of Wall Street. Compare Gordon Gekkos moral defense of excess with these comments made by Scorsese's protagonists. Jordan Belfort, I was selling garbage to garbage men and making cash hand over fist, so I was selling them shit. The way I looked at it, their money was better off in my pocket. I knew how to spend it better for unlike Gecko, makes no moral argument for his great. He knows what he's doing is wrong. He does it anyway. There no great tragedy haunting his steps like the downfall of Gordon Gekko or the extreme paranoia and eventual disappearance of one of Scorsese's other great protagonists, Henry Hill from goodfellas. Belfour does go to prison for a short time, but as he soon discovers, see for a brief fleeting moment, I'd forgotten I was rich and I lived in a place where everything was for sale for its crimes are met with minimal punishment, both physical and psychological, and just to twist the knife on that fact, scorsese has the man himself, the actual Jordan Belfort, introduces character as

Speaker 4:          03:12          single, baddest motherfucker I have ever met,

Speaker 1:          03:16          so maybe it's no surprise that the wolf of Wall Street was raked through the mud by a number of critics for glorifying apologizing, endorsing capitalists. Excess Scorsese's film certainly doesn't offer the negative critique of tragedies like Wall Street or goodfellas. It doesn't even offer a satirical critique of late capitalism such as you might see in films like American Psycho, where Patrick Bateman's smooth, almost enlightened exterior is undermined by his psychopathy, self-loathing and psychological breakdown. A satirical critique of capitalism would require the movie itself in its tone and themes to ridicule or expose the improper behavior it displays, but the wolf of Wall Street gives us no such thing. The joke is never on Jordan Belfort. It's on everyone else, his wife, his friends, his enemies and the world at large. We're not made aware of some unknown underwriting. Sadness, quite the opposite. Belfort is perfectly disaffected by the scummy ways he makes his money and the debauchery lifestyle he spends it on.

Speaker 1:          04:19          His personal philosophy, echoes that of alien from harmony, corrine's spring breakers. Some people, they want to do the right thing. Doing the wrong thing was always telling me, no, you've got to change. I'm about and change stack and change as it money. Both films are prime examples of what film critic is he black has called the new cinema of excess films in which greed and excess are explored, but never for a moment condemned. Indeed. A key feature of this kind of cinema is that the film itself partakes in the excess. It shows nowhere is this more clear than in Wolf, which runs for three hours and moves from montage too. Montage in ever crazier flights of hedonism, but just because Scorsese refuses to condemn bail for it doesn't mean that he's by extension endorsing him. Either. Excess is excess. It's exhausting. It's too much, too fast. Scorsese has no illusions about this. His extensive use of closeup reveals the vulgarity of this way of living is montage is exhaust rather than glamorize the hedonism two, which were privy is less attractive than disorienting, less desirable than

Speaker 4:          05:33          well will not die sober, get don't fuck. Walls. Street

Speaker 1:          05:40          is a descriptive project learning from its moralizing predecessors, even the predecessors in Scorsese's own filmography. There were no bud Fox is to take down the Gordon Gekkos of the eighties. There wasn't even any one to take down Belfort's elk in the nineties. The folly of late capitalism got worse and worse, not hitting its lowest point until 2008 in the financial recession, and it's unclear despite new regulations, if any of those lessons were really taken to heart. The reason for this is because the excesses of Jordan Belfort are our excess. It's like him were to enlightened not to know the expenses, which are gazillion products are made like him. We don't really make an attempt at moralizing away. Our involvement in that system. We just don't care to discuss. We feel for Belfort is hypocritical. The indignation we inflict on him is less a righteous act than a self righteous dilution. Scorsese refuses to participate in that delusion anymore, and the result is a film so unapologetically excessive that the audience might finally realized that the screen they thought they were watching was

Speaker 5:          06:55          in fact a camera.
