Speaker 1:          00:02          We have to admit there's something insidious and detestable about late night television, the kind of vicious circle. It's hard to realize until you actually go to a taping and the warmup comedian gauges your laugh on a one to 10 volume scale and instructs you that you're only at about a seven and you need to keep it up and turn it up for every little joke you're about to see because the microphones are way up in the ceiling and they won't hear you otherwise. It begins to dawn on you after about 10 cheerless guffaws that you came to the taping because you thought the show was funny and you thought the show was funny because all the jokes were followed by maps and cheers and the lapse in cheers we're forced to make are what's causing the audience at home. To think the show is funny and it's why they want to come to the taping themselves, which they do and they laugh and the cycle begins. Again, disappointing as this is. It's also truly absurd. A self generating observed that appears normal to us because it's all we know and if a really smart and innovative comedian wanted to draw attention to the normalization of this absurd American ritual, perhaps the first thing to do would be to grab hold of the absurdity and turn it way.

Speaker 2:          01:12          Oh, that's the biggest job I've ever seen and I don't think this is the right. We're going to keep going with this and we're going to see when we hit the pixelation, the only unmarried looking for love life was passing me by, so I sent off my four two hobbies and age magazine, marriage. I try to read his lovely Japanese girls have been trained in the art of fees in men. Be Lonely, no more open destinies for $1. They arrange a meeting for 10 years

Speaker 1:          02:06          years. The brilliant Craig Ferguson has lit a fire from within the late night talk show universe. Systematically deconstructing all its elements, whether it's the deferential sidekick, the live band, with the pre interview. More than any, the preinterview means nothing. It means nothing. It's meaningless. The pre interviews a formality like wearing a tie or underpants, it seemed like the biggest enemy to Ferguson sense of comedy was the very foundation of late night TV structure itself.

Speaker 2:          02:41          Ferguson.

Speaker 1:          02:42          We sought out the unrehearsed, the spontaneous. He encouraged the awkward, the weird, the difficult to know. We should start rehearsing and recognize and despise late nights deification of celebrity and took every opportunity to mock us for buying into it. I mean, it's a short time on this planet, man. It's a date and then a hyphen

Speaker 2:          03:00          and then another day and we have the hyphen and I'm like, I'm not spending the whole time talking celebrities. Now this isn't to say that

Speaker 1:          03:08          that hosts like Jimmy Fallon, who I do like is somehow bankrupt because all he does is pay homage to the format by putting it in terms young people of today can understand. It's just that he and Ferguson sit at opposite ends of the spectrum or rather ferguson more than anyone else. Willingly places himself outside the spectrum and his relationship to late night is an altogether different quality or revolutionary one.

Speaker 2:          03:35          Americans not here. You're going to lift the Dragon Tattoo. The tension between

Speaker 1:          03:42          Ferguson and late night was what made Ferguson so funny. His ability to express contempt for his position, his network, his job, his willingness to admit his failures to dwell on it was for many of us, extremely liberating, and that's because late night tv is a fantasy, a fantasy of sophistication, charm and fun. A standard to which after enough time we hold ourselves unwittingly. No one knew this better than Craig Ferguson for 10 fucking awesome fucking weird years. He tried to show us that life bears far less resemblance to a string of funny stories than to the long awkward pauses that exists between,

Speaker 2:          04:49          well, I hope we've done is. It is maybe a to maybe art is a very grand word, but, but, but what I was trying to do here and what I think that we've managed to do here,

Speaker 3:          05:02          make something that wasn't here before

Speaker 2:          05:06          all I like, I like chocolate milk. Chocolate. Dark chocolate is in. You didn't lie. You didn't want them. You didn't want to. Robot someone who creates them his own chocolate.
