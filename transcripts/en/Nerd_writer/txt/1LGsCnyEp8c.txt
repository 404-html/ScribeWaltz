Speaker 1:          00:04          It's quickly become apparent that jared cushner, the 36 year old real estate investor and husband, that Ivanka trump is president donald trump's most trusted advisor within his inner circle, a circle whose top tier includes chief strategist, Steve Bannon, and chief of staff reince priebus. Now it's pretty easy to know where priebus and bannon stand politically as chairman of the Republican National Committee for five years. Priebus is the voice of the Republican establishment, and as the former editor of Breitbart bannon champions the populist economic nationalism that appeal to so many of trump's working class voters, it's important to know where trump's key advisors stand on the issues because it's almost impossible to know where trump himself stands. Trump's not an idealogue. He's a pragmatist who's changed his views multiple times throughout the years. When it comes down to it, his political goals are basically this.

Speaker 2:          00:55          We're going to win, win, win. You're going to get so tired of winning. You're going to say, Mr. President, please. We don't want to win anymore. It's too much

Speaker 1:          01:04          evolved. Trump's advisors tasks with this charge of winning for the American people. Jared cushner is the most important but also the least understood. We simply don't know where he stands politically and there are a few reasons for that. Kushner is only 36 years old. He's got no history in politics and it's clear that even two or three years ago, being a top advisor to the most powerful man in the world wasn't remotely on his radar, is the last big project, was buying this cluster of Brooklyn buildings from the Jehovah's Witnesses in 2013 for 375 million in order to turn it into hipstery story, office space, Kushner, and Ivanka too, for that matter has always been a sort of hybrid of the left leaning hipster generation and the older mega rich business elite. Jared was certainly born into wealth and lots of it, but his family didn't start out that way.

Speaker 1:          01:54          Both his paternal grandparents were Holocaust survivors, thankfully making it to the United States. In 1949 where Jerry's grandfather, Joseph, a construction worker, started building and managing New Jersey apartments. His son, jarrod's father Charles then started acquiring real estate, turning cushner companies his business into a billion dollar empire. This is the world that jared cushner grew up in. It was deeply religious. Jarrod was brought up in modern Orthodox Judaism, massively wealthy and privileged. Jared was conveniently accepted to Hartford after his parents pledged two point $5,000,000 to the university and actually quite democratic. Charles cushner was one of the most prominent donors to democratic politicians on the east coast. In fact, he was the largest single donor to the 2000 New York Senate campaign of Hillary Clinton, and then things came apart. New Jersey based developer, Charles cushner is charged with hiring a prostitute to blackmail to witnesses and a federal investigation where he is a target.

Speaker 1:          02:56          Charles conviction was deeply traumatic for charit as of course, it would be a checkup his entire life and not just emotionally, but professionally too. At the age of 24, Jerry took over the massive empire, his father bill, and he wasted little time making a splash of his own in 2007 cushner companies bought an office building at six, six, six fifth avenue in Manhattan for one point $8, billion dollars, the most expensive single building purchase in US history. Unfortunately, it was really bad timing. A year later, the economy collapsed and six, six, six is not been able to generate enough money for Kushner companies to pay off the debt even today. But despite that setback, cushner kept at it. He kept making deals or trying to like the trendy tech office space in Brooklyn. It's clear that he's focused and driven and ambitious, but a success or failure in real estate tells us preciously little about where his mindset politically, uh, for all I know, he could still sympathize with the democratic values that his father funded so generously, but truth is Christian or seems a bit out of place in the conservative populist nationalist White House of Donald Trump.

Speaker 1:          04:04          Until you account for two things. First, his loyalty to family cushner always sticks by his own. When his father was put away, he didn't abandon him, and when trump retweeted wittingly or not, some antisemitic imagery alongside a picture of Hillary Clinton, last summer, cushing, uh, wrote an op Ed defending him in the New York Observer, the newspaper that he owns. That's the second place to look for hints of Kush nurse politics, The Observer. It was here that he developed a friendship, even a mentorship with Rupert Murdoch, the media magnate and owner of Fox News, Murdoch counsel, jared gave him advice, sent over books by prominent conservative thinkers. And soon the paper began to take on a more right wing. Then some say cushner even had a vindictive streak using the paper to go after people who wronged him or his family. Like, for example, New York attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, who investigated trump university.

Speaker 1:          04:58          The headpiece of the observer published on Schneiderman is almost comical in it's defense of trump scam school. A lot of people saw this same vindictiveness in the ouster of Chris Christie from trump's transition team last December. Christie, of course, was the man who sent jerrod's father to jail. Mr Kushner engaged in a conspiracy with co-conspirators. It's a hire prostitutes. This period is where cushner may have begun to acquire more conservative values, but I have to be fair and say that these are just inklings of what may be in his mind. He barely ever puts things on the record. He barely ever speaks to the media. What we do know is that today cushner is overseeing a laundry list of things in trump's administration, including heading the new office of American innovation, being the key liaison for diplomats from China, Mexico, and a dozen other countries, and of course there's this. If you can produce peace in the Middle East, nobody can. In most things, trump and Kushner are opposites. One is loud, easily distracted and media obsessed. The other is understated, focused and media allergic, but they both trust family and trump definitely trusts jared cushner for president with such little grasp on policy and detail. That means jared cushner might just be the most influential person in the world. It would sure be nice to know a little more about what people leaves.
