Speaker 1:          00:00          I've heard people say, well, we only had anal sex. So

Speaker 2:          00:03          delivery time, I'm done.

Speaker 1:          00:19          Kat Graham and I am a sexual and spiritual activists and author, a sex and intimacy guide for couples and individuals and a meditation teacher. Uh, I'm Lance, I'm a bartender by night and I work in the entertainment industry by day. I'm Katie. I worked in TV and film up until two years ago. I've been living there mom and married life. I'm grace. I'm 25 years old and I'm a nanny and the day and then a bartender at night. I'm Christina, I'm 34 and I'm an actor and also a youth leader in ministry.

Speaker 3:          00:55          I'm Brandon. I am 23 years old. I work in social media. So like in marketing I have not had outside nightmare. Um, that is a true statement. Yes. And I did clarify like I have not had sex in general, so I feel like that went with the prompt. Cool. Just making sure. Um, you know, I grew up in the church and so I was a typical like not going to have sex, not going to do a B through z. Um, I just got out of a two and a half year relationship coming out of it. I'm so much more empathetic to how absolutely tough it is on a day to day.

Speaker 1:          01:41          Yeah. I, I did not have sex prior to getting married almost three years ago. It made me test. If this wasn't a serious relationship going somewhere, then I could just focus on kind of my other things.

Speaker 2:          01:58          Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:59          Brandon, I'm curious, um, the way in which you engaged with your sexuality and your two and a half year relationship, were there things that you could do? Were there certain things you couldn't do and is having an orgasm with somebody considered not being abstinent?

Speaker 3:          02:14          Um, first of all, to act like we didn't do anything. I'd be lying to you. I was like, I'm just purified angel. Like that there's a white sheet is just a lie and that's just being up front is I want to preface with, is that okay? I never want to minimize sin and how I view that. I never want to run away from that. Sin is a very heavy thing and unfortunately for a lot of things we'd be fighting and maybe like getting, doing physical things, it was easier to either numb that or to make that fight. Ed, you know like I'm so mad at you right now, I don't want to be mad. Boom, something happens physically. Right. And then we're like, I guess we're calling out the whole orgasms sex thing. Right? Like that's a thing I still wrestle with. I don't know. I don't have a blanket wide answer for you. I still danced in the gray area there, but I know that in my relationship it was used sometimes it's a beautiful thing where like it was a natural thing of love and passion and just being attracted to each other. But then there was also times where it wasn't

Speaker 1:          03:08          a lot of things. We can say sex is like, I've heard people say, well we only had anal sex so I'm still a virgin. And to me that's like Whoa, like regular, like just regular intercourse, you know, before I did that. So, but that's me. Like you're more not a virgin than me. Yes, I have had sex outside of marriage in a committed relationship. Did I want to wait? Absolutely. The love is a powerful thing. And when love comes in it blind a lot and wanted to say, hey, let's just take this time and if we're going to get married, let's just wait. And we weren't on the same page when it came to that. So when that relationship ended, I made a vow to God and myself to wait. So I do consider myself a born again virgin and I'll enjoy sex in marriage like 10 times more than I did outside of it. I have heard, you know, my whole life, oh, sex before marriage is a sin. But then you know, murdering someone is always a sin. Right. But why is sex before marriage after marriage? It's not a Senate anymore. Yeah, it's just because you have a piece of paper saying, Oh, we're married, you know, now we can have sex. So I kind of,

Speaker 4:          04:21          I agree with you. We make a big deal about it being between God and the, that's the whole reason that you're abstaining. So why, why does this, people are like some kind of consensus being involved, like make it valid now they don't bring validity like it still is between you and another person in God.

Speaker 1:          04:43          My first time was a positive experience.

Speaker 3:          04:56          My first time was with my first serious girlfriend, uh, towards the end of high school. Disorganized and messy and um, silly at times. Uh, but I look back on it really fondly and we were losing our virginity is together, which I think was a really nice thing to share.

Speaker 1:          05:15          I lost my virginity and like one of my first longterm relationships also, we were both virgins, which is good cause like neither of us know what we were really doing. Um, so that was, it was awkward, but it was, it was positive. I mean I always went into it thinking, oh, the first time I have sex it's going to hurt. It's going to be so bad. My Heart's going to feel so sad that I'm, you know, I'm not married and stuff, but I felt none of that. I was like, this is great.

Speaker 4:          05:42          Yeah. My first time was hilarious. I was almost 28 years old and have still a virgin on our wedding night. So the honeymoon it got a lot better.

Speaker 3:          05:54          You know, argument used so much against abstinence and celibacy is that how do you know what you're doing? How do you like, you're not going to be trained. I think there's a cool part of learning that process with each other and learning that with one person and I think that's just something that helps you appreciate it. Love that person more.

Speaker 1:          06:12          And my first time having sex was not a negative experience. It just wasn't necessarily a positive experience. I was 14 and I just decided I had to do it. I had sex in the back of a hot rod car with a guy who was, I think about 18 the way in which it was positive. Now when I look back on it is that I started young and I had a lot of colorful experiences. Some of them positive, some of them negative, but now I'm able to take all of that experience and use it to help other people. Sex,

Speaker 3:          06:45          it can be just physical.

Speaker 2:          06:55          Great.

Speaker 1:          06:56          Okay. Um, I do think it can just be physical. I've had sex with people that I've, I mean, they were cool, but like I wasn't interested in anything else other than sex. And then that was it. And you know, they go on and I go on and it was fine.

Speaker 3:          07:13          It's definitely for me personally been something that has been just physical at times, um, both in and out of committed relationships. I think that's a really important point to make that, that sometimes it can be used as a tool or a, you know, or as just a, a way to, to blow off steam after a hard day or something that just doesn't require a deeper connection every time. Um, reiterate by almost always prefer it when there is a deeper connection. It definitely enhances the experience.

Speaker 2:          07:46          Yeah.

Speaker 4:          07:50          Uh, happen. So I think that sex can be physical from someone's own thought process, but I think you still do, you know, that there's an emotional side to it. And so even sometimes I just have friends that I know, I know that have said, yeah, this is just sex for me too, you know? But that's not truly how they feel. A lot of the time it does mean something more or they are hoping that it turns into something more

Speaker 1:          08:18          with that. But I would also say there's the polyamory community. There's the swinger community, there's the kink community, there's the just sex positive community. There's people who go to sex parties every weekend and just have fun with each other. I think there are a lot of communities that you just might not be a part of where sex just for sacs is actually a very normal accepted and positive thing, then that's fine and well. But I do believe that when two people are connected in an intimate way, a soul tie is connected. And when you are about to enter, it says another relationship or enter into something new you're carrying someone else with. It's like a, it's like a web that's being weaved into someone else. It's an emotional attachment. Um, but to some people, I do think that they can, it can just be, I guess a one and done thank you next, whatever. But I do believe that you're carrying a soul tie when you're physically and sexually. Um, connect.

Speaker 3:          09:17          I've been shamed for my sexual choices.

Speaker 2:          09:24          Okay.

Speaker 1:          09:27          Yeah, I've been shamed on both sides cause I grew up in the church too. And when I was not having sex, I was shamed by my friends that were, and then once I started having sex, I was shamed by people who were in the church who weren't having sex. Yeah. Yeah. It's crazy on either side. I think you're just going to get shamed, uh, depending on the kind of people and the communities that are in your life at that point in time.

Speaker 3:          09:50          There is that aspect of it, of being shamed for not doing it right. And you know, I work at a place where I am one of very few believers in my company and people would be like, you don't sleep with your girl. Come on Bro. You know? And I've had that in that feeling of like that pressure of like, am I supposed to be like, would that make it easier? Would my relationship be better? And like, and you started going to, is it worth the shame from the church? Is that worth it? Like, and you know, and that's, and that's a constant battle.

Speaker 1:          10:14          I always loved sex and I had a lot of sex when I was a teenager and I definitely had comments like, Oh, Jessica have sex with anyone. And that wasn't really the case. Um, but I definitely got comments like that and it never really bothered me. I would, I was always just like, oh, well, screw you. You know, we're not going, not going to have sex with you. Now that you said that. Now in my life, I get a lot of different attitudes just based on the way I put myself out there. But I do treat it as activism because I think that by speaking out and being willing to deal with the shame as well as all the Dick pics and propositions, I constantly get online. I mean, as part of the, I think of it as part of the job, you know, but it's really important. And so I'm willing to have people project their own shame.

Speaker 2:          11:00          Uh,

Speaker 3:          11:01          just real quick, I want to say a one thing I noticed right off the bat being the only one on the outside is that I'm certain that it ties into my privilege. I think in my experience, in terms of my parents and things, it's been more cautionary and certainly from a caring, loving place and I haven't felt any shame.

Speaker 2:          11:21          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          11:22          Sex Ed should encourage safe sex

Speaker 1:          11:26          over abstinence. I want to run.

Speaker 2:          11:36          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          11:38          yeah. Over abstinence. Ah, yeah. I'm just going to go sit down. Welcome. The reason why I chose to sit is because although I'm pro abstinence and I'm salvage, uh, education is education. Kids are going to make their own choices. There's free will. They're going to act on impulse, they're going to act on love, they're going to act on whatever's present to them, and if you don't educate them on the safest way to go about that, how are they going to learn? I don't believe it should be over apps, Vince, but I do agree that it's a big part of education for sure. Having choice. I think actually in some ways works for the abstinence folks because it's like if you don't, if it's this bad thing that you shouldn't do, then of course kids are going to want to do it. And so I think like by just giving all the information and offering choices, then you know, people can make a choice.

Speaker 3:          12:36          Yeah. So I think you guys addressed a lot and I think when it comes to the education, because knowledge is power, we have to teach kids why it is not, don't do this or God hates you. It's not that it should be, we love God. God sent his son who gave us the ultimate sacrifice and so we are sacrificing a physical thing that we are naturally drawn to.

Speaker 4:          12:56          I disagreed because I think it your painting just a one side of something that's really important, you know, and it's the safety side, but there should also be, if you feel like it's meaningful to you, you should definitely wait until you're excited about doing this and here's the safe way to do it. I still see an imbalance where now it's becoming taboo to talk about the option of purity. My desire is that we don't allow them the next generation to think that sex is completely meaningless and has no emotion or feeling or, or reason. You know, I think everyone has their own journey.

Speaker 1:          13:36          Uh, waiting is not mine, but you know, it could, it's yours and that's awesome. So, um, yeah, just being accepting of everyone's sexuality, whether it be super high or nonexistent at all. Um, and just being open to listening to other people's opinions. All right. That's a wrap.

Speaker 2:          13:53          Oh my God. I'm so glad I pursued in everything here.
