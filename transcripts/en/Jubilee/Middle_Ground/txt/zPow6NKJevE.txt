Speaker 1:          00:00          Depression's up. Anxiety's up. We didn't know that comes from a lack of innocence right now.

Speaker 2:          00:18          Hi, I'm a tail. I am 16 and I build a robots. I'm Taylor, I'm 18 and I'm really passionate about singing in about music. Hi, I'm Isabella. I'm 16 and I fly a plane, which is a Cessna one seven two hi, I'm fanny and I not going to see my age and I'm a filmmaker. I'm an Islam. I'm 39 plus one and I am a film director. I'm Jeremiah. I'm 41 I'm a regional sales manager for a telecomm company. Oh, Laurie?

Speaker 3:          01:00          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:01          Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:04          Okay. Well I'll start. So right now I'm learning every, I like a new thing every day, but like if I had a lot more years, then by the time I'm like 90 I'll know everything.

Speaker 2:          01:14          Yeah, that great. Yeah, just simple things like with learning how people around you act that you learned so much that you're, you're not going to learn as a 10 year old. I think it's Paris. I'd like to say I feel I know nothing. I mean, literally every day I say to you, I'm just guessing. And the older I've got, the more I've realized that everybody else around me is winging it and they don't know everything either. And we're all just trying our best.

Speaker 1:          01:40          Like when you're young, you're like, I know everything about everything. You know, from what I know to what, I don't know. That's, you know, those two things are just completely on opposite ends of the spectrum. Right.

Speaker 3:          01:50          For me, jeans today, Lisa,

Speaker 1:          02:02          Teens Rock, but uh, you know, it's forced on you and a lot earlier age online for teen boys. I mean they can find horrible images everywhere.

Speaker 2:          02:13          Um, I definitely do agree that there's a lot more exposure. It's not like an intentional thing. I don't think kids are just like worse. It's just easier to get caught up in bad situations.

Speaker 1:          02:23          Okay. Well, I personally think that we're more innocent now because parents, you guys could get away with a lot more back in the day.

Speaker 2:          02:30          Yeah, it was, we were naughty. We would do, we did a lot of things my parents never knew. But now I can, I can, you know, check on his phone where he's at and,

Speaker 1:          02:40          but sometimes you go down the rabbit hole where you, do you think your kids are super innocent and then you realize, oh they have to snap. What's this other snack? What's, what's this other Instagram? Oh I have a day when you don't know about everybody has, you know, they, I think you have to be more devious. Well I mean this one time that you got Instagram and all friends out of me, they added

Speaker 2:          03:00          me to the first Instagram account though chief parents don't see. And that was slightly disappointed in them as people, but I didn't know you had Instagram. See I got rid of it now. But I think you have to give credit to some of the kids. I do. I think that there are some kids who haven't got two Instagrams. And actually trust is the biggest element for me as a parent. I trust her.

Speaker 1:          03:21          Yeah. I mean if the question was do you think your teen is innocent? But when I say it,

Speaker 2:          03:25          teens, but I still think it's 50 50 you're saying your friends

Speaker 1:          03:30          suicide rates are up, depression's up. Anxiety's up.

Speaker 2:          03:34          We didn't know that. Just from a lack of innocence. Right. I think they were the, I know three or four people in my class that had those problems, but they weren't spoken of. I definitely agree that it's more I do

Speaker 3:          03:47          there, no you can't.

Speaker 2:          04:00          I think for me it's, I don't know if you know how much, I almost judge myself by seeing all the people on social media. Yeah, I do. Because that'd be telling you I worry every day. You don't know this when I'm on your social media looking at all these other things that people would be doing, just hoping you haven't seen it or that you're not affected by it. So I worry about that all the time. But I don't say anything about it because this probably won't be surprised cause he saw my grades from that year. But in the off more year, I skipped math class like all the time. It was awful. So yeah. Does that,

Speaker 1:          04:41          you know, one of the things that I don't think you know about me is like I feel like I'm always holding my breath. Do you know I'm a lot softer person. I'm, you know, when I get bored on my work conference call, they tell you I doodle. But I actually, I write poetry and in a lot, but I don't exactly like to talk about it or put it out there.

Speaker 2:          04:59          I wish I knew more. How was your day? Good. Please tell me what's going on please. I just want to know, like I could tell you a lot more about what I do, but it's pretty boring. I like today on the way here, you told me you're working on a documentary when you know I'm a documentarian, like shouldn't I know these things like this way I do for a living, you know, I only have a couple of years left before you go to college. I really want to be a part of it.

Speaker 3:          05:38          Cool.

Speaker 1:          05:41          Yeah, I mean I made the decision to have kids and I gave up that control of what really for me, what I had to raise a family and, and it's like my own fault, but I got kids out of it. That's great. I'll take the win on that. But you know, I want more control in terms of what I want to do and that's gonna make happy and more fulfilled.

Speaker 2:          05:58          Why I feel like I Walmart control, it's not, I wouldn't even, I wouldn't say it's your mom, it's, I just would like, like to be doing more things by now. There's so many things that I wish I knew like for music and like making an actual song and things like that. So I feel like it's more of that environmental holding me back then like home life

Speaker 2:          06:23          for me, I really didn't feel like I was a good trauma own life. Now that I'm 40 I feel like I'm finally grown into who I am truly as an adult and owning it. I'm in charge of my own life. It's nobody else. I'm personally good with the amount of controller have though I would like it if you can show me how to control it myself. So when I finally got to college and I'm an ink pen and I can actually have to do these things. Yeah, I think I'm currently very happy where I am with what I control cause I understand that there are some things that I don't have control over. And I think when the divorce happened, having your parents break up as to to see something as big as that, that is something I have no control over, but I knew that I could control how my room looked, what I ate, what I wore. I kind of embraced and took hold off because I knew that that sort of, I had control over.

Speaker 4:          07:23          I wish in my relationship with the other side.

Speaker 3:          07:33          I don't know about this. I think I'll go,

Speaker 2:          07:39          why are you shaking your head?

Speaker 1:          07:41          I think there's always room for improvement. Even if you're at like the best seats, you always want to get a better relationship with your parents. Got It. I just, I feel like it. So I had kids when I was 20 by the time I was 22 I had both my kids because I was a young parent. I look at my kids and I go, oh that really, that mess that messed him up. Dang it. They're going to remember that one. You know, I just, it's like, it's hard because I know I haven't been, you know, completely perfect one. I wish I could have a bunch of reduced but I can't. So moving forward I want to try to continue to work on and get closer for sure.

Speaker 2:          08:16          Like at this point what like both like me and you are looking for is just how to, how to have like the father daughter connection still after high school I and I think we both feel that really hard right now. Yeah. I also had them young and you know, I'm divorced, so single mom with two kids and says pursuing the career while dating and I was feel like, oh my gosh, I did the whole thing wrong because there I am going to Bates and I do feel like it had an impact in them. Especially my dad was my youngest. Okay.

Speaker 1:          08:57          You were a lot like you're always gone a lot, but that didn't really change the relationship that much. I don't think you having today was a bad thing or having me to really even know you probably could have waited a little bit more and there's, for example, there's always still room for improvement.

Speaker 2:          09:21          It's not me saying that I wished the relationship would stay where it was good. I think we're in a good place. I just don't feel right now that it needs to be better. Well in the, I don't think it's definitely not perfect, but we're learning at the same time. Improve it constantly. Yeah, constantly checking in every day with each other. We're always changing and I think you have to s to work with that. Yeah. Let me have all the time. I never knew.
