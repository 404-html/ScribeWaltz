Speaker 1:          00:00          You are, you're painting a fantasy. You see it as a fantasy. I mean, I think the fantasy is using the system to think that it's going to bend to our will.

Speaker 2:          00:20          Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:22          Uh, my name is Derek Bros. I'm 33 I'm from Houston, Texas. I'm a journalist and an activist. My name is Kaitlin. I'm originally from the bay area, but I just,

Speaker 3:          00:30          we were down and I am 21 years old.

Speaker 1:          00:33          I'm Andrew. I am 27 years old. I'm from Scandia, Minnesota and I'm a documentary

Speaker 3:          00:38          filmmaker. I am Telisa Ray on 42 and I'm a senior analyst for a utility. My name is [inaudible]. I'm 21 and I am a student.

Speaker 4:          00:53          My name is Renada. I'm 24 I'm from Pennsylvania and I worked for a software company. Can I give my folders on the left side? And mine is on the right side. Bye.

Speaker 2:          01:20          Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:20          Well, I believe my vote matters because I'm a woman and first it was denied for us and now I have the opportunity to use my voice. But in addition, I'm able to use my voice as a black woman. Excuse me. I get a little emotional about that. Considering though we were citizens black people long time ago, we weren't given really the right or we were denied x accessibility to go to the voting polls until I feel like it is my opportunity to go ahead and speak.

Speaker 3:          01:53          I have the ability to vote, I have the privilege of civil so I will do so and like growing up, like my, my oldest sister wasn't able to vote until like a couple of years ago because he's autistic and since it's the whole guardianship thing and it was actually until a couple of years ago that people under guardianship were able to vote. And also because of the undocumented people that are around me and my family, all the formerly incarcerated people that are disproportionately affecting, you know, black people. I think it's always important to vote, not for myself but for them.

Speaker 1:          02:26          I come from Minnesota and I think it's a very civically involved state. I always saw it, everybody you kind of voted. And when I was going into college, I was a part of this campaign called the vote no campaign, which was to turn down a constitutional amendment, which would have made it illegal for gay people to get married and I am gay. And so I got involved in that campaign too to try to prevent it from happening. And we went from a very low approval rate, um, same sex marriage in Minnesota too, in just less than a year, um, uh, very large approval rate. And we ended up to feeding that constitutional amendment and eventually became one of the states that legalized same sex marriage.

Speaker 5:          03:10          I'm part seminars as well. And our ancestry is same thing, had been denied different. Uh, I hesitate to call them rights because I don't think things that the government gives you our rights. I'm like privileges, you know? So I, I don't really know if I would call it that, but I definitely understand them denying a certain privileges in the past and how now that we have those privileges, sometimes we feel inclined to like, well, my ancestors didn't get to do this, so I need to do this, but I still hesitate to say that my vote matters. Now there are some instances, like for example, you were talking about gay marriage and I think maybe on a local level we could see the impact of our actions. I think it's become increasingly clear that whether you're talking about the electoral college or voting machines being hacked or you know, we're not even getting into philosophical side of things, that your vote really doesn't matter that the end of the day there's a small group of people who decide what goes, yeah,

Speaker 4:          03:59          I can understand your point, especially with the history part. However, I also feel though that it's an informed decision that I'm making and of course it's more impactful locally. And because of that, because of my community and where I live and all the changes that occur, it's important for me to, to have that voice even if there's an off chance that it may not really be effective. It's my right to use that voice and I'm sure you can understand that. I think my vote does matter to an extent where it shows that I agree what's happening politically and since I do disagree with what's going on politically and I don't believe that this country has a true democracy. That's where I think, um, my vote doesn't matter at that point. For me, I'm more of a moderate, but I do lean a little bit conservative. But as Finn from being in California, you know the votes are going to be towards more democratic votes. Personally, I don't think my vote wouldn't matter. You know, when I'm voting for the primary,

Speaker 5:          04:56          the way I see it is that I vote every single day. I vote with my actions. I'm very involved in my community. Well it drives me crazy. I guess it's just that every two to four years people all of a sudden pop up and act like they know what's going on around the country just because the TV or the Internet is telling them, oh, it's that time to pay attention again. And so they get ready to, you know, and then you get to the point where some people are shaming those who choose not to participate, you know? So, uh, you know, I just, I guess just for me, I want to encourage more people to vote with their very being, not just like, right on that list of a paper or press that button and like, okay, that's it. I'll worry about it again in two years, four years, whatever.

Speaker 2:          05:29          Okay.

Speaker 4:          05:31          Okay.

Speaker 2:          05:35          Yeah.

Speaker 4:          05:38          I mean, I'm proud to be American. I really am. There's a lot of opportunities that this country has given me. Um, I don't necessarily agree what's happening in the government. I don't necessarily agree with the way of life here, but I'm happy to be from here and I'll always be proud of.

Speaker 1:          05:55          I had moved to Brazil to finish my degree and when I was living there, I kind of had to make the decision whether I wanted to move back to the United States are not. The reason why I was thinking about staying in Brazil was why I wasn't happy with some of the things going on in the United States, the politics, the healthcare system, all of these things were just stacking up and I was thinking, God, that country is going to shit. But I realized, well, I can either be a part of the solution and making it better or I can just give up and run away. But I chose to come back here and I've been living here for five years now

Speaker 4:          06:24          though I am glad to be here in America. When I think of patriotic, I think of, I believe in everything that the country stands for. You know how we operate and I'm just going to be honest with you. I don't, um, it's too many injustices in today's society. I'm a bit embarrassed to say I'm an American.

Speaker 4:          06:59          The whole lesser of two evils. That's exactly why does it have to be to me both. Yeah, exactly. Why not? Why can't evil. Yeah. Or why not look to other parties, party systems. I don't fall under any of that under my, my religion, not one politician has ever understood what it's like to be a Muslim. Nothing is being, nothing's being pushed on my agenda and it won't be. It will not be. Um, and I think the whole system, the way it's set up, it's just, it's always has an agenda first certain type of people and it's always going to be for that certain type of people. It's a propaganda to get people, the masses of people to believe that we have a voice and to believe that we have democracy when we really do. Do you not, I don't want to agree with the voice part, but everything else. But you didn't, you don't agree that they were the right candidates? I don't know. I don't have a voice side where this country's going.

Speaker 1:          07:55          The way I understand it works though is they got there somehow they got there through, so we're kind of out. But they did. They cheated their way there. I mean, even when somebody like Bernie Sanders tried to say, hey, we're gonna use all our grass roots delegates and we're gonna challenge this system using their own rules and they just change the rules. I guess that's why I feel like we should vote though. Especially right now for the primaries, it's like, I don't think we should give up. It sounds like you guys,

Speaker 4:          08:17          no, not at all. Not at all. Not Giving up. It's just approaching it in a different way to me. I was going to say though, as an activist, aren't you trying to promote change through your actions but through people's minds? Not to the political system? Well, for me, I didn't vote for either two candidates. I wanted one Jen, John Casick to when the Republican Party, but he didn't. Um, and then also Gary Johnson as an independent, uh, personally I didn't want to vote independent because just my community members seeing on social media don't vote independent or are you going to lead Trump win? I can't please both sides cause it's so far left or far right. And I'm just like, what do I do? You know? And, um, I think I got to the point where I got frustrated where it's just like, you know what? I'm just not going to vote. I just feel that our current system is not inclusive of everyone's thoughts and ideas.

Speaker 3:          09:16          Yeah. Like when we create a binary, um, we've forced people to choose one thing or the other. And that exists like in all aspects of, um, you know, being a person and participating and you know, politics, like there's so many different types of people. There's so many like different types of, you know, thoughts that they have that could be beneficial. And I think we should probably start existing outside of that.

Speaker 4:          09:41          Shane. Yeah. I think it's the bottom is us as individual since a, we're considered, you know, the bottom, the last resort that, that voice that's, you know, small. I think that we're the bottom and so we start with the change. Change starts with us when we look in the mirror and how we see ourselves and how we see other people. I believe that's where it starts.

Speaker 5:          10:07          Absolutely. You know, I think that really the, the smallest minority we talked about a lot is from minorities, but the smallest minority that is always under threat is the individual. You know, those individuals can be gay, can be black, if you're white, can be Muslim, but it's the individual individual rights pertaining to a number of different issues. At the end of the day. I think that, you know, Minnesota would got a lot sooner to gay marriage and approval of that if the government just got the heck out of the way and let free people do whatever they want and get married as they please and you know, vote when they please and you know, come just get the heck out of the way and all sorts of arenas and let people organize their affairs. You know, men, women, whatever color, whatever religion. I get that, but that's not an option.

Speaker 5:          10:43          I think like you're, you, you're painting a fantasy on, you see it as a fantasy. I mean, I think the fantasy is using the system to think that it's going to bend to our will. I mean that that wasn't an option. That's not a choice. It's like you could say the same thing about women's rights, African American rights and I believe in it, but people worked together to change that. And that's what I'm saying. I think that's where the divide is, is like right now I'm saying we should work together to have a positive impact on the future. I'm with you. I just won't follow you into the ballot.

Speaker 2:          11:11          Okay.

Speaker 4:          11:12          Consider the system that we are in today and how you can make the change today. Whether you feel that it is not impactful, your vote for me matters. Your vote locally matters. It'll change something in someone's community. Um, so consider for me, I want you to consider the thought that someone else somewhere else does not have the same opportunity to go in and be heard in the way that they choose.

Speaker 3:          11:41          Let me, I'm always going to have a lot of respect for people who decide not to vote because they don't believe this system works. I agree to that to a certain extent. But I believe that local wording is always the most important thing. And like voting in community has always

Speaker 4:          11:54          been a part of forming that community.

Speaker 3:          11:57          I think for now on it's just more like I hope that there are people who won't be too far right to far left and that we could all just kind of like chill out and that I could like, you know, just vote because it, it's my opinion and my ideas and that I hope that no one belittles me for that opinion that I might have. It might not be popular or it might not be trending on social media but that it will be just accepted and that I don't need it to sweat. Like take one side or the other side.

Speaker 4:          12:25          At the end of the day. People can do whatever they want and they can keep it private to themselves as well. And if you continue doing the same things that you're doing, nothing's going to change.
