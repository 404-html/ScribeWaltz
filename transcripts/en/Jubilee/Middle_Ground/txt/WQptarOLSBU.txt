Speaker 1:          00:00          I wish there was just more compassion. No, we don't want to make something difficult. We just want to be acknowledged. My daughter was a victim and she's being punished.

Speaker 2:          00:10          Okay. Hi,

Speaker 1:          00:22          my name is Marissa gold. I am a parent. I have two girls, 10 and 13 and I'm also a parenting expert with my own parenting company, intuit parenting.

Speaker 3:          00:32          My Name is David Epstein and I'm a pediatric intensive care physician. I'm Gary Schlepper. I'm an internal medicine physician.

Speaker 4:          00:39          I'm Bob Sears. I'm a pediatrician. I guess my greatest passion is just to help encourage a full, complete informed consent for vaccinations.

Speaker 1:          00:49          Awesome. Marissa? By trade, I'm a designer. I am also an activist and a mother. I'm Melissa Floyd and I would consider myself an informed consent advocate. I just want to make sure this conversation can be open for people and continue to inform people and to listen to everyone to understand why we each come to our opinion on this. First statement is I am vaccinated,

Speaker 1:          01:23          so I actually wasn't fully vaccinated. Interestingly, I grew up with two parents that were into alternative medicine, so I was not vaccinated as a child, but as I got older I vaccinated myself. Well, I was vaccinated as a child, but in my last vaccine was about 15 years ago when I returned to college and I had a severe reaction in that I became arthritic in my hands. Went to many, many doctors that nobody knew what was going on and why it was happening and just shrugged like it doesn't make sense. You're too young to have arthritis. And it wasn't until having kids and sort of digging into my own research for them that a lot of answers started coming up. And I think it's unfortunate that a lot of it is overlooked

Speaker 3:          02:07          for me, it, I'll continue to get vaccinated. We know regardless of of the risks, because I've seen too many things on the other side. I've seen kids come into the ICU and die from being on getting the flu. I've always felt like though, the risks are far outweighed by the benefits of, of getting the

Speaker 2:          02:25          protection,

Speaker 1:          02:27          not getting vaccinated and dangerous other people.

Speaker 2:          02:36          Okay.

Speaker 4:          02:37          I will acknowledge of course as a pediatrician, I know vaccines work. I know they give you protection and they vary greatly in what that protection is. It's not like a hundred percent magical shield over you completely, but I do acknowledge there are some vaccines like the measles vaccine and the chicken pox vaccine, but honestly if you don't get those vaccines, yeah, you do risk the disease and passing it to others.

Speaker 5:          03:01          It's such a complicated topic. Vaccines and you're starting to get micro with each individual vaccine and that definitely the question was talking about the big picture and I think yeah, if you get micro, probably some of these vaccines. I think when you're giving kids medication you have to get micro about it. I don't think it's doing your kids any service to just say vaccines are all made the same and they're all safe and healthy and good for you that everybody's benefiting from it because that's false. We studied them before we released them to the public. We study them so we do know they're safe. That's the thing is we know ish. What else? He say,

Speaker 3:          03:38          being an intensivist, I see the worst of the worst, and so seeing the other side of kids who don't get vaccinated, I saw a kid walking with meningococcemia, which I haven't seen in decades. He had all four limbs cut off. They had to be amputated because it was all dead tissue. You forget how bad things were before we had vaccines.

Speaker 1:          04:00          I didn't step forward for that because I don't like the assumption that if a child is unvaccinated, somehow they are of risk to everyone and also knowing that vaccinated individuals can also be carrying and spreading diseases. I think it's very polarizing to separate the two as if if you're vaccinated, you're totally fine. You're not risking anybody anything. Unvaccinated children don't just have diseases and hanging out in their bodies waiting to unload at any moment. Anybody could be spreading diseases, especially things like polio and pertussis that are not completely covered by the vaccine.

Speaker 2:          04:34          Okay.

Speaker 1:          04:34          I do anything to keep my child safe.

Speaker 5:          04:43          I agree. I don't have kids, but when I think about it, you know, the idea was vaccines is you're protecting all of us. You're protecting the group. Okay. Now there's this idea of herd immunity and so I think that's why it's really important to talk about because this is an issue that doesn't just affect you. It affects everyone around you because there's people that aren't vaccinated that are sick or have immune issues or they're too young to get a vaccine and they count on her to immunity. I think

Speaker 1:          05:10          most people too, like I started out vaccinating my daughter because I believed all the same things that you said. It wasn't until she had a reaction and several reactions that I actually had to look at it differently where I, I realized that by continuing vaccinating for her, that actually would hurt her and yet everyone wants me to do it for the population as if I'm supposed to continue to sacrifice my child for everyone else.

Speaker 3:          05:31          Well, I mean there, there are medical exemptions for vaccines. If your child has a reaction and then there's, there's concern, I think that's valid, but I think a, a larger population is using other justifications to not get the vaccine.

Speaker 4:          05:45          You know, a number of families who look into vaccines, they will decide to opt out of vaccines because they feel they are just not willing to risk the side effects. But side effects or the

Speaker 5:          05:57          side effects are like one in a million, one in 2 million. Whereas the side effects from the diseases, when I see all these outbreaks and things like that, I'm going to choose vaccines everyday.

Speaker 1:          06:07          And that's, I think right there is the disservice to this conversation because it is a risk benefit analysis. And what's unfortunate is how downplay those risks are. I only started investigating vaccines because I ended up with a kid with an auto immune disorder. So what does that mean? And instead of finding answers, I have more questions. The one in a million is not a real number. It's really not. And so the more that that is put out and so people think that no, it's not. Not when you're talking about the different kinds of reactions,

Speaker 4:          06:34          well I think the number you're referring to is Anna Filactic shock that Anna Filactic shock is of course, extremely rare. Whereas when you look at seizures from the MMR vaccine in our one in 3000 right.

Speaker 1:          06:46          But again is creating fear,

Speaker 4:          06:49          worry that you get the those on your side kind of down play those.

Speaker 1:          06:52          So my daughter has seizures, seizures for most people are considered kind of a big deal. You know, when it happens to you that that downplayed element of, while that's not Anna Filactic shock, it's just a seizure. It is just a seizure. But seizures can be dangerous.

Speaker 5:          07:07          I don't think it's an idea of downplay. I think it comes back to what we were saying with the risk benefit analysis. And I think the data's very clear that the benefits of giving vaccines by far outweigh the risks. So I don't think it's a question of downplaying the risks. They're there, but we also know that children were dying and now they're not. And yes, there's side effects, but they're not as bad as what we had before. Vaccines,

Speaker 1:          07:34          I don't always trust my doctor's opinion.

Speaker 1:          07:45          Anytime anyone, whether it's a teacher, a friend, something I read online, my mom, you know, my, the doctor, anytime anyone tells me, oh you should do this. Especially if it has to do with their health, I'm going to do research. And it's, I would be careful about saying it's that I don't trust my doctor, but that has, that trust has been developed over time. And so I would say in the early years when my children were very young, when they would say, this is what we recommend, yes, of course there were times where I got a second opinion or did the research on my own and ask the questions. And I think that as parents we have to do that. Well, it's hard to trust someone who sees your child for 10 minutes, twice a year. Uh, in the end, parents know their children best. And that little office visit where your pediatrician looks at your child, he does not know your child the way you know your child. So it's really hard for whatever recommendation he's making to be really based in India, individualized for your kid. So if you were to come to your doctor and say, Hey, my child is acting differently after this, this well visit appointment, something's wrong. You want them to trust that you have an established relationship and listened to you and hear you and understand that as a mother just because you don't have the Dr in front of your name, it doesn't your opinion somehow less valuable.

Speaker 5:          08:57          Yeah, I mean I think like anyone, doctors are fallible and they don't know everything and I think it's very important, like you were mentioning to have a really strong doctor patient relationship. I think that's really hard. And today's 10 minute appointment age, you know, it makes it really difficult. But like as a young doctor, I think there's a lot of distrust when it comes to physician recommendations. It sucks because you know, you spend decades training and learning and your heart is in this place where you want to like be of service to people and then you're not trusted. But you know, to answer the question, you shouldn't just blindly trust anyone's opinion, your doctor or anyone.

Speaker 1:          09:38          Ironically, the doctors are the ones that, well,

Speaker 3:          09:42          I trust my physicians. Um, my daughter has epilepsy and in March she was also diagnosed with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. I went to the rheumatologist and the rheumatologist is that we're going to put her on methotrexate. And I looked at her, I'm like, methotrexate, that's a chemotherapy chemotherapeutic agent that, you know, kids with cancer get. And she's like, yes, but we use it in a low dose and it doesn't cause harmful side effects. You have to trust me. I said, okay. And I trusted her and I am so glad that I did. Before all this happened, she was a competitive gymnast and she used to walk up and down the stairs. Like she was 90 years old. She couldn't hold a pencil in her hand. Now she's back on the bars back on the, on the beam doing things, which my wife and I never thought that she would do again.

Speaker 3:          10:38          So yes. Do I trust my physicians? Yes. Do I question them? Yes. I will say, look, can we do this for her? Can we do this instead? And yes. You know, I, I can appreciate what you guys have said as far as people hearing you. And I think that's the biggest problem in medicine is that time is short. Clinicians aren't listening. And I think that as, as a pediatrician, you know, one of the most important jobs that we have is to listen to parents. And I think that if any pediatrician isn't doing that, they're not doing their job.

Speaker 1:          11:10          There is too much hostility between the two sides. I don't like it. I don't, I want us to be able to talk. I want us to be able to have relevant and educated conversations. And I think at the core of this conversation is what is at the core of humanity and being a parent, which is that we all want to do right by our children and we want to lead happy, healthy and productive lives. Yeah. I have no doubts in my mind of how I've come to my decision making on the subject, which has been tedious and thorough to say the least. I did not to go down this path in my life, but I have people who won't be friends with me, who I've had death threats on social media. I might not even be able to send my kids to school depending on how legislation changes because of the way I think it just, it's insane to me how hostile this has become and it's not doing a service to research and science move forward and just the overall dialogues we have in our culture, whatever the subject, what I think is lacking in this debate or conversation is really compassion from the provax side or pro mandate side.

Speaker 1:          12:27          I'll say the people who refuse to acknowledge the vaccine reactions are happening or that the things that happened to my daughter, we're connected because maybe it was just a coincidence and I just needed something to pin it on. You are socially isolated. You can be isolated by your family, isolated by the medical community, community isolated by society as a whole because they assume you're unintelligent, uneducated, any rational. I wish there was just more compassion that, no, we don't want to make something difficult. We just want to be acknowledged. My daughter was a victim and she's being punished.

Speaker 3:          13:00          When I signed up for this, it was a little bit of trepidation coming into this because you do hear things in the media. You know about the people who are anti vaccine and the way they respond to physicians and an end. It is a little bit scary. You know, as as physicians, we care about people. There's compassion on, on the medical community side. We wouldn't do this if we, if we didn't care. But again, you know, I do have compassion for the families that have gone through issues with, you know, with vaccines and I've, I have great deal of compassion for the families that had children die from preventable diseases. There shouldn't be any hostility. There should be discussion. I mean, we can always question things that, that's how we evolve. That's how we get better. If we didn't question anything, we'd be still in the dark. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          13:46          Thank you for sharing your story, doctor. It was a pleasure. It's a pleasure. Dot. You've got to kind of say around, yeah.
