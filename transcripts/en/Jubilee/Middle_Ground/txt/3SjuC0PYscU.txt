Speaker 1:          00:00          I was in an abusive marriage and my father yelled at me that I was going to hell when I walked out. I'm sorry. I don't believe in a god that would believe that. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:24          Can I have all of my name? Yes.

Speaker 1:          00:39          Hi. One Pizza.

Speaker 3:          00:43          Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:45          You gotta be kidding. My wife will not have a pizza unless there's pineapple on it. You can try anything on paper. Yeah, why not? I'm going to, we're going to disagreers Pete's pizza. I like you tasted the cheese, the sauce and the bread. That's it. It's like, it's like candy. That's like having candy on a pizza is that it's like them. I'm nervous about what's going to happen today.

Speaker 1:          01:32          I mean I'm, I'm, I'm nervous because this is a normal topic that people can usually talk about, but in this climate is very touching me to even say I believe. I don't believe, you know, it's funny. I would think that you would feel safer in the belief category then I feel in the non belief category, I was raised in a house very culturally Jewish. We talked a lot about God and religion and many different religions of the world, but, um, I wasn't raised with any faith with any religious faith in the house just two years ago. I hated Christians. I think I was an atheist, but I voiced all my doubts and skepticisms and they gave me their perspective on it. That kind of opened me up. And that's why I'm a man of faith today.

Speaker 2:          02:21          I believe.

Speaker 1:          02:33          If I think, if I just choose to believe that everyone is surely bad or evil, then that's going to be pretty. And then you have to decide what the definition of good it is. According to Christianity, there is no one good. No, not one. But I don't necessarily believe that if no one's good, I don't want one with a sin nature. Yeah. So that's hard. It's like my definition of good, it made not align with scripture. So it's hard because that's why I hesitated like I want to leave everybody's good. If antithetical to the Christian belief is that you're born, um, it's sinful. It's interesting that the three of you came who are believers in that. I'm not saying people are innately good. I'm saying I just learned this other question as all people are capable of.

Speaker 1:          03:22          Yeah, no. Start with Hitler and go from there are people, you know, are some people born good and turn bad? Well, I think that's what the definition of good is subjective, so that's why it's like the each to each his own for definition and you just kind of hard. I don't know what is right or wrong without the Bible because it's gone, but it makes the rules really about God. You have no rules. You don't. You can't make a decision on your own whether it's good or bad. What about handler? He made the decision. I thought it was good and he was wrong. You don't need the Bible to tell you that. Well, you, you're born with that God. Put that in you as conscious as you believed. That's not a belief. It's a fact. I'm an author of two books where I give the whole history of the earth from paleontology, geology, archaeology, published about four articles on numerous subjects, including politics, science meaning Enix dinosaurs

Speaker 3:          04:30          to my mother.

Speaker 1:          04:36          Yes, I would want people to think that they have worth and value, but I mean we are all ants on a big boat. We are all very important. The design and those things. If a man were to design it, it would cost several million dollars to make a human if that were possible, and yet he's, God has created billions of us. I believe in people. I believe we make our own choices. I don't believe that there is a overriding being controlling those choices are controlling our situation. You are, and I'm so, I do not think that inherently just existing gives you worth and value. I think that you make choices, personal choices every single day on how you live your life and how you treat people and how you exist in the world and those, well, hold on. You just made a definition about what value is, but you still don't believe you're valuable based on your explanation. I said, I'm not inherently valuable to my being. Born does not just based on your contribution to the world determines your value. Don't know. Please don't. There are many people who just exist because of instinct or because do their lives have value. I don't know if find value in it. Sure. If they don't, maybe not who, who am I to judge whether somebody is life is inherently valuable

Speaker 3:          06:08          on the existence of a higher, Huh?

Speaker 4:          06:14          I am a woman of faith and belief. I believe in the supernatural and higher power and a being that there's no accident and the way we were created.

Speaker 1:          06:26          Yeah. I think anytime I have gone through hardship, I've questioned not just what I believe. I questioned my life. I questioned my profession, I questioned my relationships. So yeah,

Speaker 3:          06:36          and I, I think you know, if you believe whether it's Islam, Hindu, I think you have to die. You can't just jump in there and be like, sign me up. I agree with everything. Let's do it.

Speaker 4:          06:46          That would be for you. But nothing up for everybody that is a believer of any particular religion. People don't question anything.

Speaker 3:          06:52          But in your view by standing and saying, you know, I don't think there's any high power you do. Do you ever face any doubt of thinking? Maybe there is.

Speaker 4:          07:00          Well, the definition of an atheist is someone who does not believe. It's not a declaration per say that there is no god. I am an atheist activist. I'm on the board of atheists United here in Los Angeles and on the steering committee for Americans United for separation of church and state.

Speaker 1:          07:25          No, I've never had a doubt because I can see design everywhere. And you are not an atheist. You're an agnostic. Nope. It's an agnostic. Now, Leo told me what I am. I am an atheist. An atheist doesn't. I am an atheist. Atheist doesn't believe in the supernatural period. The atheist and agnostic. No. No. Does believe the supernatural that does not. He just doesn't believe in God. I'm telling you what an atheist is. No image, healthiest supernatural. Do not tell me you don't need to make anybody right or wrong. It's just answer the question. Give her space to talk. Give her space to talk. Do you believe that this line of interrogation questioning furthers your, no, I'm just giving facts

Speaker 5:          08:14          saved by the bell.

Speaker 3:          08:17          I am feeling frustrated right now. Yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm feeling frustrated because it's even amidst the fellow believers, like the things he says, I'm just like, Yo, I don't even know. I don't want what he says to reflect what my faith is to, you know what I mean?

Speaker 6:          08:37          I think it's sad that people are so determined to make other people wrong and I grew up in a household with it, conservative Jewish mother and a born again Christian father and I was in an abusive marriage and my father yelled at me that I was to help when I walked out. I'm sorry. I don't believe in a God that would believe that it's not and that is objectively, I don't care.

Speaker 1:          09:04          That's crazy. Exactly. Kind of shuts down conversation. Exactly what you believe in. Why White Dome?

Speaker 1:          09:21          Again, we have the power to choose our response to things, so I choose not to feel hurt. I choose not to be misunderstood. I think there's safety in being heard and understood. You feel as if the, whatever it is that you want to be understood about matters. I'm getting married in the next two months that I'm learning energy and effort to understand someone who's different. I think, you know, I think we're kind of as a society and becoming lazy, so we're like, oh, you're different. I don't want to understand. I mean, people who are just always been that,

Speaker 3:          10:07          oh look, we all agree. We all have room for it.

Speaker 1:          10:13          My aspiration on a daily basis is to be a better person. We're always learning. I used to think at some point I would like Oh, actual allies into, oh, I've made it, made it into maturity and wisdom. You know, when I'm in college, I'll have it figured out. When I get married, I'll have it figured out when I have kids. I have it figured out, but we're always, we won't reach perfection until we get to heaven down here. As an imperfect world, we can, our knowledge is imperfect. Our bodies are in perfect. Our world is perfect. I mean, I'm, I'm agreeing with you, but it's the delivery of it, right? Let's stay up. What was the question? We all believe that we have room for improve, certainly.

Speaker 6:          11:06          All right. Alyssa, I acknowledge you for keeping very, very focused and not getting ever heated but staying focused. I appreciate your honesty and the way you stand up for what you believe.

Speaker 1:          11:21          Nancy, you have a presence of self. You have a very still very centered quality to you that is, um, very admirable. Christine, I acknowledge you for not running out of the room when you were in a controversial conversation. Um, I acknowledge you for standing your ground for believing what you believe and you've got a lot of fight in you. Uh, Jeremy, I acknowledge you for being unwaveringly from and what you believe and not caring, whether it's controversial or difficult to say what you believe. Um, that is a sign of passion growing up. I think you're a wonderful guy and your marriage is going to make it grow even more. You just seem like a very comfortable guy who's willing to learn and grow and that's a lovely, lovely quality and something Rissa. You have this ability to take stock of yourself and make decisions. Like when you said, I choose not to be heard and so I'm not hurt. It's just, it's an amazing quality in some, thank you.

Speaker 3:          12:32          Nice to meet you. How are we invited to the wedding?
