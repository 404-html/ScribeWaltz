Speaker 1:          00:00          We built a society where we're told to go to college, find someone we love, work a job for 50 years and we're going to live happily ever after. But it doesn't happen, but we don't necessarily feel it that you guys actually set us up for success.

Speaker 2:          00:21          Can I have my millennials stand in the right ball of light and my baby boomers on the left tool at light when it comes to jobs, you should do what you want.

Speaker 3:          00:37          Love.

Speaker 1:          00:44          I'm going to say, hell yes. Do what you love because if you don't love it, you want to do a good job, then get quit and bring a company down, et Cetera, et cetera. I agree. I mean, I tried to put myself in a position to stay away from things that I don't like. I hated to go into school, so I left and I cannot tell you how powerful that was. I'm the CEO and founder of tens of tea. I went to Ucla, hated going to school, so I dropped out after three years and became an entrepreneur.

Speaker 4:          01:16          It just occurred to me though. I wonder if maybe we're all fortunate enough that we can because not everybody gets to just do what they love. Maybe circumstances don't allow that depending on, you know, I'm just fortunate I was brought up in a family that allowed me to explore options and paid for me to go to college and even though we all agree that you should do what you love, I agree with you completely and it went through my mind, but I think that it's important, at least for me to say, everyone should be able to do what they love and to have that be an expectation for everyone and not have it be an expectation. Okay, well you know, if you have challenges in your life, then you'll never be able to do what you love.

Speaker 4:          01:56          We had a Japanese restaurant growing up and I cooked tempera, you know, did my homework and took naps on the stocks of bags of rice that we had in the back. Did I love it? No, but we did it because it was part of survival. I did computer science and I was a program or for 10 years before I decided to pursue what I really love, which was music. So Dede, I don't agree with that statement. Do you love all the jobs and I'm sure your goal to do what you love, don't you think like whatever. It might have to take steps to get to that, but that's what I worry about if we're going to talk about generational differences. I own a couple of businesses in Missouri and I think sometimes the younger generation doesn't get that part, that just be to do what you love. Sometimes you have to do some things you hate to get

Speaker 3:          02:42          fair.

Speaker 2:          02:44          Millennials don't work as hard as previous generations.

Speaker 3:          02:48          Yes,

Speaker 4:          02:55          I live in southern Missouri and I own a couple of businesses there. So I do think when I'm in La I notice a big difference. So I think part of it is a geographic thing. You know, I live in a small town in the middle of nowhere where you know, people don't have role models necessarily that or to look up to that are, are as motivated. And it's also really easy to get free stuff. You know, low income housing, food stamps and disability. Or they'll come to me and say, well, I can only work 25 hours a week because if I work more than that, I'm going to lose my low income housing. Like I said, I think that's partly the society where I live makes it too easy not to work. I think a baby boomer is somebody who was taught to work hard and that if you want something, you have to figure out how to go out and get it. And don't wait for somebody to hand it to you. If you try hard enough, you can. You can get about anything you want.

Speaker 5:          03:47          Oh,

Speaker 4:          03:49          I wasn't talking about you guys. So it all depends on who you know and who you run into around me. There's sure a lot of millennials that are working hard. I know I hear stories about others who are lazy, but isn't that the truth in any generation? Yes. I work with a younger generation all the time. And so I, I mean they come in 24 seven you know, they're working very, very hard and I couldn't work without the younger generation. I wouldn't want to work that. The younger generation, I think millennials work harder than previous generations for less safety net and less structural stability. And I think you see people who maybe they're not trying to go to work as hard because they know that if they try and they lose whatever assistance they have or if they tried to go to school and they get in debt and they can ever pay it out or know that they can never live in a place other than that low income housing unit, then there's like a lack of agency maybe to try but also so many forces.

Speaker 4:          04:50          And then you know, you have all these companies that are trying to get leaner and deliver on short term profits. So they hire people as contractors. Like all my friends are contractors and they don't have health insurance, they don't have any of these other things. And then so like they've got to work harder. So I guess when I hear that about millennials, it makes me upset just because I know how hard my friends are working. I think the word millennial is often use to portray a small slice of millennials. I don't quite fit some of those stereotypes, but I don't think there's a single stereotype either

Speaker 5:          05:20          young people today face harder challenges than any previous generation.

Speaker 3:          05:26          Oh yeah. I'm actually gonna to disagree. Okay.

Speaker 4:          05:34          Oh cool. Can't wait to get that. I think the biggest challenge facing young people days, the environment and that we're growing up in a world that is not being taken care of and what that means for, you know, me and my children, if I have children, what type of world they're going to be living in. And I just think it's not something we're addressing at all. I think the social media, it, like I said, it can be a great tool, but I also think it can make life more difficult for people. Um, because you can get offended or bullied or relationships can be totally different now because of, you know, people break up with you over a text or whatever. And I think that's adds benefits, challenges to that we didn't have

Speaker 6:          06:17          as an adult. Um, I find it hard to compare it to my mother and her generation when it comes to meet you and to buy a house. So when it comes to me trying to save money, because I am one of those contract workers and I do want a family and so is, do I continue doing what I love? I do. I did go back into the though rat race and try to get ahead and try to do Xyz. That's the pressure that I face on a day to day. Right.

Speaker 4:          06:44          Companies that hired you for life and you have tension, you had good to let, you know, that's all gone. All gone understand. The cost of living is so high. Or if you live in a place where it's not high, then there were no jobs. You know, I think it's harder for you guys.

Speaker 3:          07:01          Okay.

Speaker 1:          07:02          It's good to hear all your points. Um, I still think that we actually have it a lot easier. Um, and I think the problem is that we expect too much. Um, I don't think that we should deserve to assume that we're going to get to immediately be able to afford a house. And I think that we have a lot of things going for us. And I learned a lot of really valuable skills completely for free. You can join Facebook groups and meet other entrepreneurs. It doesn't cost any money. You can literally take classes at MIT and Harvard for free classes online and you guys didn't have that access to information was in there. I totally get the financial and environmental challenges. So I think that we have the resources to kind of solve them.

Speaker 4:          07:50          It's important to, you know, want to be a, have leave each generation better than we found it. Um, because if we lose sight of that, then you know, what are we working for?

Speaker 1:          08:01          My children will grow up in a better world than I did

Speaker 3:          08:05          shit. Yeah, absolutely.

Speaker 4:          08:13          Absolutely. Because I'll make sure that I think absolutely. Yeah, absolutely.

Speaker 6:          08:19          For me. I am determined when I do start, my family did that they will have a better life than what I've had. I'm going to make sure as a father, as a provider did that pastor happened period point blank.

Speaker 4:          08:32          I don't have children but I'm speaking for children in general is even though I first said life is harder for a younger generation, I think you're right and you know healthcare is getting so much better, so much faster and then the Internet has made so many more things possible that I do think that young people will grow up in an easier world overall then we did.

Speaker 1:          08:52          I definitely agree with the personal sentiment that we all share, but I do, I do like think that one of the things we didn't really have to talk about was that like we don't necessarily feel that the, you guys actually set us up for success. Like essentially we built a society where we're told to go to college, find someone we love and go buy a house and work a job for 50 years and we're going to live happily ever after. But it doesn't happen. I just don't get like how do you guys assumed that we were going to be able to do that exact same thing?

Speaker 4:          09:21          No, no. We'll all I know I don't assume that, but what I do is that I put the work in so when you put the work in and, and

Speaker 6:          09:29          maybe not you per se, but the larger mindset of the boomers is necessarily, you know, you guys are working like I did and you guys be okay. Like, Nah.

Speaker 4:          09:39          I think the expectations are changing. Like I, everything you said about the house in the marriage, you know, I mean in my generation and that was my job as a female wisdom. Catch your husband.

Speaker 7:          09:49          That's right. That's why we went to college. That's why women went to cut. That's when my Mrs Degree College,

Speaker 4:          09:55          your generation has so many more opportunities in a wider vision of what happiness can look like and that it doesn't necessarily mean you're going to live in a house with a picket fence and you're going to have 2.2 kids and you're going to stay in the same job forever. I mean, I think you have so many more options available to you. Some of that has shifted for you. So I hope at least it has. I think that's what I love about the younger generation now is that they're working on themselves first as opposed to falling in love and you know, getting it right.

Speaker 6:          10:24          That's going to be all well and good. But I think what we're saying is we've been sewed up a creek without a paddle.

Speaker 1:          10:34          Okay,

Speaker 4:          10:34          well I'm a mom so I'm looking at the future and I feel for you guys, you know who you're working hard, which is great, but everything is getting more expensive on the environment. Yes, that is a concern. But one of the things that really concerns me is a national debt and we're borrowing and borrowing from the future or kicking the can down the road, letting you guys and your kids and your grandkids take care of it. So I, you know, I, on behalf of our generation, at least on that aspect of life, we're really sorry we're, we are, we're leaving a big mess for you guys and I just pray for you guys pretty far. Children, I am hopeful to. I'm optimistic for our kids, but I'm also well aware of some troubles that we're leaving our next generation.

Speaker 6:          11:21          Yeah, but I will tell you this, you will survive. I don't want to survive.

Speaker 7:          11:25          You will survive you all three of it.

Speaker 6:          11:31          You can't be entitled to anything. I'm entitled. We want what we want. The what was, what did the new deal. There wasn't a cell for. We want that too. That's all we're saying. We want the basics of the American dream period. There you go.

Speaker 7:          11:48          All right. That's all the time. Hey guys, what's up? My Name's Dan and I'm Jason and thank you so much for watching our episode.
