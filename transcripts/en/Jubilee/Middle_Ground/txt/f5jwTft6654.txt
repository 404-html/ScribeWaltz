Speaker 1:          00:00          This is a physical manifestation of love. This is glorious and beautiful and any God, which denies me for this going out, but part of it,

Speaker 2:          00:08          okay,

Speaker 1:          00:16          on the left hand side, can I have my LGBT folks on the right hand side and I have my concerns.

Speaker 3:          00:30          There are times when I feel uncomfortable expressing my views around sexuality.

Speaker 4:          00:39          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:40          I am uncomfortable primarily because the bromance of like, well there's two girls who's the boy and then it really just breaks the ice as it's like there isn't supposed to be a boy. That's why we're there. I do my best to break the ice with the comedic deflection, which I've learned is, is a self defense mechanism. Right. So I come from a very

Speaker 1:          01:03          serving of community and so, you know, it just wasn't talked about. The people I've had the most conversation with about actually my family, which is really weird cause I came out to my parents because my dad was going to be leading the protests at the pride festival that my boyfriend want me to go to.

Speaker 3:          01:19          So I'm a, I'm a pastor as well. Um, I'm also a community leader and Boyle heights and in that community there is a large, um, LGBTQ presence. So there's that fear of really coming out and say what I believe because I do love everybody and I don't want to be pushed to the side just because I have a certain feeling about any topic really.

Speaker 1:          01:47          I just wanted to say too, and you know, it's not the beliefs that sometimes I have a problem with her. I think people have a problem with in China it's just like the actions from the belief, so like it's okay to have beliefs, but if we like can be loving and our beliefs and you know how our actions come from those beliefs and like I love that we're having this conversation, you know, like trying to breach those, like build a bridge.

Speaker 3:          02:11          Some sins are worse than others.

Speaker 4:          02:18          Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:19          In the eyes of, you know, of the God I worship, I believe that any sin separates us from him because he's holy and pure. But at the same time I think there are certain sins that will have greater consequences. I resonate with that. For me, it would be, you know, killing another human is the worst. That's it. Also it Venn diagrams into abortion. Taking the life of another is huge, is huge. Can I ask you to this, uh, do you all see homosexuality as a sin? Yes. And if so, where on that scale, I don't think I'm, uh, homosexual tendency or an attraction to somebody of the same gender is a sin. Um, I think that's a natural feeling. I think when you start engaging, um, in a lifestyle and you act upon that tendency then because it goes against what I believe God designed, then I, I think that's clearly a sin.

Speaker 1:          03:22          I just don't believe in sin because I feel that sometimes being punitive about things can like make you repress things and like instinctually I was like, but not acting on them would be a thin, like that's how it feels for me. Like being dishonest to myself at that feels wrong.

Speaker 3:          03:42          At some point in my life I was taught that sex is wrong.

Speaker 4:          03:51          Okay.

Speaker 3:          03:52          I guess like within the context, uh, you know, sex is bad outside the context of marriage. Um, and so I guess that's how identified with the question.

Speaker 5:          04:01          Oh, I had a very strong religious upbringing and I ended up doing a lot of self harm and I ended up doing a lot of things just to try and cope with these urges that when I finally gave into them, oh, this is, this is a physical manifestation of love. This is glorious and beautiful and any God, which denies me for this I don't want have a part of, because whatever this is is I know for a fact to be a truth because it is the nature of love.

Speaker 3:          04:32          Yeah. I'm just responding to your story. Uh, it makes me sad to hear that, um, that you decided to hurt yourself. Um, yeah, I still hold on to what I believe are my beliefs, but at the same time, I wish there was a better way for you to talk to someone and to process and to think through, um, reconciling how you feel with like, what you may have been taught or have read through scripture.

Speaker 5:          05:05          Yeah, I mean, and that's the thing is I think there's a lot of, there's a lot of cultural baggage I think around Christianity that isn't necessarily inherently part of any biblical Christianity.

Speaker 3:          05:20          Even though I grew up in a Christian family, I was, I don't recall ever being told that sex was wrong or it was a bad thing. Um, I think I, I grew up with the understanding that sex is a beautiful thing. It was given to us as a gift to enjoy. There's a place where it's, it's been designed for a place where we can enjoy it and there's a place where it's, it's the testable in the side of the creator, the one who gave it to us. I just don't like the idea.

Speaker 1:          05:48          Yeah. That anything's really detestable, you know what I mean? So I,

Speaker 3:          05:51          I just don't like it. You see that even in sex for you within certain context is, is testable. Like, like if it's nonconsensual like that's pretty detestable. Yeah, I agree. Even in that, the things that I can

Speaker 1:          06:03          send to are, I think, not that like at that I have sometimes no control over it. If it's not consented,

Speaker 3:          06:11          people should honor the pronouns others wish to be called. Oh,

Speaker 4:          06:18          hesitations enough.

Speaker 1:          06:23          I'm all for this. Like I identify as gay people don't consider it. And I think that like having these conversations about how people want to identify is like really important in a way that we can move things forward and stuff.

Speaker 3:          06:37          Yeah. I forgot to like, hey, if you don't use right, whatever, you're gonna get fined or whatever. Like that's, I, I'm, I'm not a big fan of that or conversations between us, but yeah. But otherwise it's just being respectful. Oh, the Pronoun Police. So for me, um, I never correct people because many times people do confuse me as sir. I don't know. It doesn't faze me. However, I'm born in a female body. I'm a sheet. There are times where my girlfriends, oh, my boyfriend, isn't that just because of their comfort zone. They don't want to have to deal with the whole like social stigma. So you're comfortable with them presenting you as a, as a male. It doesn't faze me. It doesn't phase me at all because my identity and my expressions are masculine. And I've come to the terms in the realization that I don't need to chop up my body and the different pieces to fit in a social little box.

Speaker 3:          07:26          That is, man, if you want to address me you can address me as he or she or them are girl Becky with the good hair. It doesn't as long as the term is respectful. Yeah, I will take it. Uh, I'm an ice tea bag just because it's a complicated topic because with language, language is powerful. And so when somebody who I would consider a female wants to be called a a male, I would want to probably respect that. But um, I still firmly believe that, you know, they're like God created there to be men and a woman and um, I would like to sit down and talk to that person in depth before leaning one way or the other. Yeah. And I think like focusing more on like building a relationship instead of just like grilling some, why do you feel, you know what I mean? Like just try it. What's wrong with you? Like, why America is heading in the right direction when it comes to inclusion and diversity.

Speaker 4:          08:30          Okay.

Speaker 1:          08:34          Uh, for me it's more like the youth are headed in like inclusion and diversity. And I wouldn't necessarily say it's the institutions of power. I think the youth are really moving our culture forward and like it's encouraging to see,

Speaker 3:          08:53          I can't imagine what it's like to not be able to be who I am and having to hide. So I think it's good in that sense that people finally are living in a, in a world where I can be who I am and I don't have to be ostracized and I can be included. And the reason why I didn't step in is because, um, you know, I have certain values of that I think are from God. And so that's why I hesitated a little bit on do I come forward or not? But,

Speaker 5:          09:21          well I have a question cause I, you know, I'm curious where the sanctity of your marriage comes in. Like if you can only get married to wound because you and God and. Dot. Woman, how about relationship that is perfect for you. I'm curious how that affects, uh, who we can marry.

Speaker 3:          09:38          Yeah. I don't think the job of a Christian, for example, um, is to get people to behave in a certain moral way that's in line with what the Bible says. I wouldn't be wanting to say you can't marry, you can't marry another guy or you can't marry another girl. I would say, first of all, God loves you. You know, God loves you. Yeah. So, uh, specifically talking about like propping, um, when properly came out, I was completely against it. I thought it was foolish and ignorant and in by many churches supporting prop eight, we basically tell you, told the gay community that we don't care about you. We don't care about how you feel, what you think love is. We're just going to mandate that you can't marry who you say you want to marry. We're adversaries. Yeah. We became adversaries. And the church I think lost a great position and saying and coming to people saying like, we love you. People should have the right to have sex with anyone. They want anyone. Okay. Yeah. Alright. Consensually right. Alright. Essentially with anyone. I, okay. Yes. In the term anyone except children. Yeah. As humans, we and his creatures of a divine spirit, we have the right to follow our instincts and our sexual urges without punishing ourselves for, you know, wanting a woman. You're wanting a man and so, yeah. And you, anyone has the right to consensual love making.

Speaker 4:          11:22          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          11:22          So, um, the, the reason why I stepped back and, and you guys would agree with me, but, um, when I was nine years old, I was touched by a family member. Bye.

Speaker 4:          11:38          Okay.

Speaker 3:          11:39          And so, you know, if that's, I can't set forward when, when that question is asked and, and I know you guys want to agree with that and that's you, you preference of the very beginning that, you know, if as long as it's consensual and, and not kids, but that was my experience

Speaker 5:          11:54          and

Speaker 4:          11:57          yeah, really sorry about that.

Speaker 3:          12:00          No, I, I resonate with it as well. I mean, I was as well, you know, and there wasn't a family member than God. However, it's still a enough of a tumultuous problem that even when I came out as a lesbian, I wondered if it had to do with that incident and definitely brought up and that's why it was the first thing I said, you know, cause you no one is innocent and doesn't know.

Speaker 4:          12:25          Yeah, absolutely.

Speaker 3:          12:29          I believe in a higher power.

Speaker 3:          12:37          I'd love to hear it from your perspective. Oh, why you, why you believe in a higher power? I mean the household I was raised in, why not, uh, the analogy of like you can't, one cannot see level one cannot see air and it's still there and you know, started going to more clergyman and wanting to understand. Exactly. You know, my ways of being in the image of a greater creator, understanding I wasn't a mistake. You know, cause you know there is a higher source. There is definitely something that has given me these blessings that have nothing to do with me. It has everything to do with the bigger picture of things.

Speaker 5:          13:12          I think for me, you know, I, I was also raised in a very strong religious background and just as I can not deny this part of me that was the way I express love. I'd be dishonest if I said that when I sat down and I prayed and I listened, I didn't hear,

Speaker 3:          13:28          oh no, it's time for the heathen. You weren't no mistake.

Speaker 1:          13:34          I resonate with some of the things you said too. Like I do believe in a higher power. I just don't believe in like a typical higher power. And I also like highly believe in science. So I'm like, I believe in gravity as a higher power. I believe in like entropy is a, you know, like things that we, that are out of our control and stuff and I want to always keep searching and always cute questioning and like always trying to find like as much love as possible I guess. And I believe in other people's gods too. Yeah. Like I believe in that for y'all. You know what I mean? Like if that's what makes you a better person and makes you feel more yourself and feel more love like I believe in that, you know, but I can't say that I believe it for myself cause I, I dunno, I don't want to cast my all my Eczema.
