Speaker 1:          00:00          You can say whatever. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:01          Why am I nervous? I don't know. I'm nervous right out.

Speaker 3:          00:05          Ooh,

Speaker 4:          00:12          my name is patty and I am pro life. I had two abortions. I know what happens to the emotional and psychological part of women.

Speaker 1:          00:23          My name is John and I'm pro choice or the six years of the planned parenthood of golden gate.

Speaker 5:          00:28          My name is Marie and I am pro life and I help him in reverse their abortion and once they've started them if they would like to do so.

Speaker 6:          00:36          All right. All [inaudible]. Hi Sports is the question. Do you do this thing? Is it tight?

Speaker 2:          00:58          No, don't do it.

Speaker 1:          01:02          Well I'm the only one. Oh well sandwiches. Just something between two pieces of bread and that's what hot dog is.

Speaker 2:          01:11          I disagree and sandwiches, two pieces of bread. Right. But a hot dog bun isn't two pieces of bread does its own thing. And just the way it's Eaton was if you had a hot dog bun and you put um, like Deli meats in there, would that be still up? Would it be a sandwich? That would still be a hot dog though still, right? I mean, it's like, oh, okay, are we going to solve

Speaker 6:          01:40          next? Sometimes I have a question around frozen.

Speaker 2:          01:50          Oh, right.

Speaker 5:          01:52          Yeah. Because the other person's perspective and you're like, okay, that makes sense. Yeah. No, I think I questioned mine often because I could imagine that if I wasn't living my life based on my Christianity, um, I would want women to have that choice as well.

Speaker 4:          02:17          I used to be a pro life feminist really, until I had an abortion. Actually I had two and after I realized what I had done, I knew I had made the biggest mistake in my life. I realized that it was, it wasn't my, I shouldn't be taking the life of a child. So after that, I struggled with it for 35 years with my abortions. And so I have no doubts. I am all the way pro pro life.

Speaker 1:          02:53          But I believe fundamentally that the woman should have that right to make the decision. And if I've never been anybody, anybody's pro abortion, and oftentimes they don't have good choices and they're picking the lesser of the bad choices.

Speaker 4:          03:07          Yeah. I just feel like, uh, my, I'm very certain of my views because, uh, I want to respect that everyone has that option. Um, and I think that if you take that away, you in danger children more than if you allow them to make that choice for themselves. So, but she, uh, we'll make and choose for herself, but she doesn't have the right to choose for someone else because if a child is inconvenient as a toddler, are you going to kill that child as a toddler? And then they were talking about a completely different thing knowing that science, we're talking science and I'm saying like a lot of times women have to have abortions because of medical reasons. That's like a lot of time time. Oh, you got us right in the thick of it.

Speaker 6:          03:55          Next,

Speaker 2:          03:58          I know of the,

Speaker 6:          04:07          my sister had an abortion.

Speaker 5:          04:10          Um, almost two years ago I found out I was pregnant and had an abortion forced on me by a man twice my age who made a ton of money. And I felt like I had no other choice if I wasn't a Christian. And if I didn't believe the things that I believed, I would be pro choice like 100% but at the end of the day, like to my core, I believe that all human life is so sacred and it's not our choice. It's never been our choice.

Speaker 4:          04:38          I realize that I shouldn't have had that choice because I was choosing life and death over another human being. It's taking alive. But I do understand, definitely understand where you guys came from.

Speaker 1:          04:52          The only difference we have is when the fetus becomes a human life. If that's an and B, then my tonsils in the movies, I think

Speaker 5:          05:03          it's a scary gray area. And in the Bible you did say, you know, I don't know what part of Christianity, but Jesus says, before I formed you in your mother's womb, I knew you and not a sparrow falls from the sky without my knowing.

Speaker 2:          05:13          I feel like I really respect you and your faith. I respect, respect that that's your feeling and that you all feel that way. But I also feel like, um, one can feel that way regardless of the Bible, regardless of Christianity. You know, it's one of those things that

Speaker 6:          05:28          okay

Speaker 2:          05:28          happens and has happened actually for decades, you know, for a while and people make that decision and it is their decision. They make that decision for whatever reasons. You know, I mean again, you, you help people who have taken a pill first then change their mind and I think that's great, but if you have one and you feel regretful, then deal with it. If you have, when you don't really feel regretful or you feel like it really, truly was the best decision for you, then that's what happens. And I just think we all know people that, or I don't, I just don't feel like we have any right to, to force a particular way. And you know, I think it's great to, to try to just be open, you know?

Speaker 6:          06:08          Okay. Pretty judge, I believe.

Speaker 2:          06:24          Hey guys, it's been a long time. I think we all feel that way because, because

Speaker 4:          06:32          it's an emotional, a very emotional topic. I've actually been verbally attacked by a lot of the pro choice people. You know about what I went through with the regret, the alcoholism and all of that stuff that tied into the abortion

Speaker 1:          06:48          for me. It's something that Maria said a little bit while ago about her Christian faith and implicit in that, is it someone whose approach choices and Christian, I was raised a Roman Catholic. I consider myself a Christian. I don't believe that there's anything in Christianity as I understand it, that requires me to believe that abortion is murder.

Speaker 2:          07:09          I grew up in a Christian home. My mom's a pastor, but they also respect that they know that it's my ultimate decision and they know that what it is I'm going to do well, I'm going to choose for my life. They don't have control over and that I am an adult sometimes in the argument between the two sides. There's a lack of respect for the fact that like, I don't have to agree with you. You live your life the way that you want to and I'll leave it the way I want you as long as you're not stopping. Sorry you guys.

Speaker 6:          07:50          I have two kids. One a son who's 30. Uh, and then a daughter who is 28.

Speaker 4:          07:56          I have one son who is 36. He's adopted. I couldn't have children biologically. I convinced the doctor to give me a Tubal ligation because I didn't feel I punished myself for having the abortions.

Speaker 6:          08:10          Okay.

Speaker 2:          08:10          I have a daughter, she's a year old and she's in heaven.

Speaker 6:          08:19          To me, it, my experience at planned parenthood was everybody got to kids. And the, the slogan, if you will, of planned parenthood was no child, unwanted child, not pad. We wanted our children and that's why we chose to have them.

Speaker 2:          08:36          What about all the people that would gladly take care of that child that cannot have a pregnancy to save their life?

Speaker 1:          08:41          Well, because the woman has to, it has to go

Speaker 2:          08:44          nine months for a whole life that a child could have.

Speaker 2:          08:52          Um, I think one of the things that I immediately reacted is that, okay, nine months, whatever. But there are so many children, not just in America but the world over that don't have loving parents that are not in a loving situation, that are not cared for, fed, clothed, loved. And I, and I think that is the most important thing to care about our children because they are our future. So the child in the womb has no value whatsoever. No, I don't think so at all. I'm not saying that I never said, I'm just asking, just saying that to me that's unclear whether it's you know, this or that or this or that. And despite the fact that you say there are people out there that want to adopt this child or want to take care of this child, there are still so many that are not.

Speaker 2:          09:36          And that's, I don't think that wrong. Makes this right though. I understand that. I'm not saying that I'm only, I'm only, I'm only responding to your comments about my, my view is I don't, I don't personally want to have kids. I want to adopt all my children because of that reason. And because I live with a family that took me in when my family didn't want me. And so I understand that one, the foster system and adoption is not that easy. And if we're making it about taking care of the child, yeah, let's do that. Let's take care of the children. But we need to make sure that there are opportunities in place for all the children to be successful so that that child has a world that co to come into you. It's actually going to be good to it because we don't live in that world right now.

Speaker 2:          10:17          We don't offer those things to our children. We should talk a lot of the people that came from a ton of adversity, you've now made it in this world who live talking about that. We're not talking about the success cannot be about people that I am a kid, so to day they do not. And they're worth that worth, in my opinion, is exactly equal to a 20 week baby and totally understand and I respect that. I'm only saying, my only comment was I feel like it's unfair to be like, well, blah, blah blah in nine months. Why can't you just have a kid for nine months? And they give it up. Oh, cool. It is getting cooler in here though, isn't it? Yeah. Um, I wasn't expecting to hear some of the stories about people's lives and their experiences, um, who've had abortions. And like I can only, I can only imagine the pain that is associated to making that decision. And I have a lot of compassion and sympathy for people who go through that. Um, I wasn't expecting, I wasn't expecting it to be as calm as it was. Um, I think that there were moments, but I think for the most part we were respectful each other. And,

Speaker 4:          11:54          um, I still think that you guys are awesome people. I the outside of this situation,

Speaker 6:          12:07          okay.

Speaker 4:          12:07          I wasn't surprised at how this has gone because when we were all talking outside, it didn't make any difference who's side was on whose side and we, and we all bonded right away. You know, sometime you are levels got a little bit raised, but you know, why were we all respect each other?

Speaker 5:          12:24          No matter what you do, you've, you've heard all the arguments. There's not going to be one argument where you're like, oh my gosh, I just changed my mind. No, it's never going to, you know, people are who they are and it usually takes a certain situation happening, but I think it's healthy to have the dialogue. I think it doesn't happen enough. It happens too much behind our computers.

Speaker 7:          12:44          Oh, okay. Cool.

Speaker 6:          12:46          Sorry, dogs. It was great to me. Yeah.
