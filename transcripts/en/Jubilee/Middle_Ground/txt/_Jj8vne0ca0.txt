Speaker 1:          00:00          Because a, it's not your land be, you mentioned Europe.

Speaker 2:          00:02          Well you can tell me that. Please don't say that.

Speaker 1:          00:11          When it comes to the Israeli Palestinian conflict, I think I'm mostly emotionally sad.

Speaker 3:          00:21          I think it's not fair that you know a country that is peaceful. Being in a situation where we have to be threatened. Being an Arab girl, living inside of the Israeli state, it's pretty hard for me to find exactly who I am.

Speaker 2:          00:41          What of the Palestinians who still live under occupation. So we have no power.

Speaker 1:          00:47          I believe that every person, Jew, Christian, Muslim, should be full equal citizens under Israeli software.

Speaker 3:          00:54          We need just to end this conflict between us. It's because we don't need the other generations to live the life that we live in.

Speaker 1:          01:08          Continue to do what we did until now. It's probably going to stay and we need to do something else.

Speaker 3:          01:28          My name's Hannah, Ziad. I'm 24 years old and I'm an area being utuber. My name is [inaudible]. I'm 25 years old and I'm a Jewish Israeli Zionist. My name is [inaudible]. I'm from netlists 25 years old. Studied public relations and communications.

Speaker 1:          01:44          My name is [inaudible]. I'm from a small town called [inaudible] right outside of Jerusalem and I'm 24 years old.

Speaker 2:          01:53          My name is Arab domain, how many? 24 years old. And I'm from Jerusalem.

Speaker 1:          01:58          My name is Ron [inaudible]. I'm 34 years old and I work as a deputy director of a think tank that deals with law and economics. Firstly because of this.

Speaker 4:          02:28          Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:31          Okay. My father was murdered by two IDF soldiers. Um, it hit us hard, especially for my family. We're only girls and and inside of the Arabic nation that's really hard. My friend when I was 10 years old is we get a sniper, a should it her, uh, in her head. So that was really hard for us.

Speaker 1:          02:55          No, I grew up during the second intifada, the carry a list with

Speaker 5:          03:00          me of all my friends who were murdered in terror attacks. So I have a list of 27 people. They were actually very close to me in Israel. We have on Memorial Day. So I have always a dilemma which grave to go to.

Speaker 2:          03:17          The 16th of January, 2007 Israeli soldier shutting killed my sister there. She was 10 years old, front of Ferris called and I was 13. We were six kids in the house. After that way we can,

Speaker 4:          03:35          okay.

Speaker 5:          03:35          All of the people that I know have lost someone, um, to the warrant in some way. And I think like grief is such a universal emotion. Like I'm, I really, I want to hog it. I serve in the IDF. I still serve in the army reserves combat. I was very competent. The second Intifada, and I feel your grief and I, I understand it, but I have to say that I've, I never got an order to shoot someone. Uh, the origin was only to shoot if someone is a threat to your life or a third to someone else's lives.

Speaker 3:          04:12          I also served in the IDF and they really do just teach us to defend ourselves. If we're not defending ourselves and we do kill someone, we go to jail. That's not true. That's not true.

Speaker 2:          04:24          I can't tell you something. The soldier that killed my sister, he didn't spend one day in there. Neither did my father, both of them that murder him did not stay in one day in jail. I haven't we a Tuesdays pollution as possible. Okay. I think that Tinian they will not stop saying that. We we want, we want a country. So in the end, if we got to the point that we have our state and they have, they state so no problem.

Speaker 4:          05:04          Okay.

Speaker 3:          05:04          This is going to be better for us to live all of us together, which has no state like Palestinian, no state like Israeli only together and having fits together like there is no walls and there is no checkpoints which has happened right now

Speaker 2:          05:17          I'm with you. One state, Andrew, Israel's sovereignty and everyone's full equal citizen. Alrighty. Okay. But Andrew Israeli sovereignty because right now I [inaudible] he's got a problem. Why should it be on one? Why should one religion control? Why can't that region, it's a nationality. It's my nationality. So if Justinian the Palestinian, they control it. You can't live under it. No, because it's not going to because hey, it's not your land be, you mentioned your slip. You can tell me please. 100% that's then used to meant one question. Yes. These Ansari, you are a grand four grand grandfather. You know where he is. Yes. Winning is to give me how many, how many grades do you want me to call? Seven. Three, four, seven. Before I knew it. Yes. Seven before isn't hungry and hungry. Nine before he isn't Palestine. Don't tell me it's not more than that. I'm saying it's not your land. It's our land and will be

Speaker 1:          06:15          like, how do you determine this is our land and it's not their land based on what

Speaker 5:          06:22          history? International law. Interest. So Verdi. Yes. How about empathy? I have empathy. I'm just not willing to live to give up on my identity and what I believe is mine. I'm afraid of the other side.

Speaker 3:          06:42          When I say that I'm afraid. What I basically mean is I'm afraid of going into Gaza because I knew that if I will go into Gaza, I might get shot. Someone might kill me.

Speaker 1:          06:53          I think I hesitated a little bit. I don't think I'm afraid of the people on the other side. I think I'm afraid of the gap and sort of almost equally afraid of like, you know that side taking all of their responsibility for what is happening or this side taking all of the responsibility for what is happening, which is obviously not working

Speaker 3:          07:17          well that's fair enough. I don't believe that all Palestinians are terrorists cause that doesn't make sense. But I do believe that who is in charge, they are leading the Palestinians to, you know, hating us and in, in, in, in a way that, you know, eight is really unfair.

Speaker 2:          07:34          I'm against against what you saying they are lot days lab because Islam didn't, didn't say kill killing people or having your blood don't belong that

Speaker 3:          07:46          cool Muslims, the radical Muslim said come and do these things. What do you have to say? They're not part of us. We never accept them as Muslims because they're teaching hate. And in a way I accepted what you just said about there's a big problem with our government. They don't know how to talk to each other. And in my idea, I really think the people are the ones that I should be talking to each other.

Speaker 5:          08:06          I agree. And I have to say also don't think there's an issue with Muslims, but I disagree with you about the fact that it's about plans there. There's several peace talks. They were offered 97% of the land, 98 would have done it. They disagree.

Speaker 3:          08:19          After deciding with the land, they came and they built more settlements.

Speaker 5:          08:23          What's wrong? What's wrong with Jews living in Judea?

Speaker 3:          08:25          That's not the problem. The problem is, is that we actually talked about this land being for these people. And in the end when we see Israelis coming in and actually building houses that showing us we. Dot. You guys don't want peace.

Speaker 5:          08:37          I shrunk. I serve in the IDF. So first of all, I trust myself and my officers. I do think that a lot of the information I'm getting is not accurate, which is why I tried to it with different, uh, sources. And I also start to see it from, from people, what they, what they think would they feel

Speaker 4:          09:02          okay?

Speaker 3:          09:04          I don't trust everything. I see on the news, that's for sure. I do believe, again, there are two sides to every single story, but I do see things that are happening. For instance, you know, things like the rockets that are striking or the stabs that are happening, those things I do trust because I can see that they're happening and they're just unfair.

Speaker 1:          09:22          Like I see the, the narrative being written. I was like, I watch TV. I know how important and how powerful language is and how it can create um, reality and like I can, I can see it. I like this is really dangerous on both sides. It's really dangerous.

Speaker 3:          09:45          Overseas media that I see, they're always against Israel for things that are not necessarily our fault. I find it very funny because we look at it as in start saying that they're really with Israel, which is funny. I find it kind of funny, but no, I seriously do find the information that we're getting has more as an agenda to it from both sides. I don't believe in social media. Like from the Israeli side, I'm going to support Israel and the Palestinian side get a support. Palestinians. People are going to be very confused and I'm going to be very confused about the reality

Speaker 5:          10:18          smooth flavor date. The question was the sources. So it doesn't have to be just social media and I'm going to be poor. It's like this. Like I also trust the reports that the Israel's six to security forces, uh, publish,

Speaker 3:          10:29          but they are doing their ideas about the reality in the situation, but their ideas, how do they are a seed, his situation, it's not really what happened.

Speaker 5:          10:41          Political leaders on my side to many compromises

Speaker 4:          10:46          per piece.

Speaker 1:          10:54          If we continue to do what we did until now, it's going to continue as it was now. And I don't see it getting better. Our leaders should have our lives and and the best for us in their minds. And so it's not compromising like pieces never compromising

Speaker 2:          11:15          the Palestinian bulletin. They, the, they one a piece for they selves and for the people, but they have no power because the power, it's not in they hand. It's the end, the other side.

Speaker 4:          11:29          Okay.

Speaker 3:          11:31          I would like for us to compromise only if you will be able to compromise. It doesn't make sense that every time that we have a war, it's always started by your side. The other year, a day I just heard about, you know, over 1,800 acres of crops had been burned by, you know, Hamas who have been sending it over to Israel instead of, you know, all that money in order to ruin us. Why don't they spend it on taking care of uh, Palestine? I talk,

Speaker 2:          12:01          just wait just one second. You're talking about Hamas. You have talking about Gaza. It's so far from us. We don't know what's going over there. We don't know if you can ask me about the West Bank. I'm can, I'm going to ask. I'll answer. I think you as well,

Speaker 5:          12:16          but here's the way I see it. When you're talking about compromise, Hamas' Charter says murder. Did she? Wherever they are in the PA did. There's a golden bear and hold on, hold on, hold on. But the PA, the PA, let me finish it, but it's in the authority that are the moderates. They're saying it's a death sentence. If you sell your house, did you are there are racist people of Israel of course, are the racist people everywhere in the world. Yes. But we condemn people who are acting violently and the other side glorifies violence is justified.

Speaker 4:          12:51          Ooh, I don't know.

Speaker 3:          12:54          If you're going to attack Israel, then Israel is given to defend themselves and that means when it comes to certain things, maybe not you specifically, but again, to the radical Muslims, we have to, because if we don't, then there's not going to be a state of Israel anymore.

Speaker 5:          13:14          I don't think it's a matter of um, Israeli Arabs or Jewish. As Christians. Sometimes we laugh. You have to use violence. I hope it will be close to zero as possible, but if I see someone about to murder someone else, I think it's okay for me to use violence to stop that. I think violence is not allowed for a political goal. I think that's a bad place to use violence. I prefer talking and having a discourse.

Speaker 2:          13:36          Okay. I didn't grow up with a, with a lot of violence with zero violence, but what I went to say the same as you said, who comes to my house to broke the door to take my father. Of course I will live in school myself, so it's called a violence. But I want a difference for myself first.

Speaker 3:          13:56          Well, I am against violence 100% it's a freaking circle is going to keep on happening over and over again for me. If you're going to react for the violence with violence. So here we go. We're having like the same problems, the same generation who's a raise with hatred and violence and love blood, which is not accepted.

Speaker 5:          14:24          Is it important?

Speaker 3:          14:29          I think that Israel needs to be our homeland because if we won't have a homeland, no one else is going to accept us anywhere else. Especially because there's a lot of racism and antisemitism as well. So if we're not going to be here, where are we going to go?

Speaker 2:          14:46          Okay. For me as a Muslim, the Holy Land. It's why it's so, first of all, because I was born here, I have no place at another place.

Speaker 3:          14:57          Every single person around the word had the right to live in the plate that they were born. And that the right for Palestinians also for if we're going to talk about refugees also, they have the right to come back here, did their labs, did their homes and uh, have their places.

Speaker 1:          15:15          The fact that we came back to our homeland and that we do have a country in a government here for me, like it does feel like a miracle. But I also think that the fact that we do have the power now gives us more responsibility. Um, and that we can't just base it on the fact that it's our homeland and not hear other voices saying we feel the same about the same place. My place.

Speaker 2:          15:56          Okay

Speaker 5:          15:56          all the time requested me if he's more dialogue, more force, more. Um, conversation is more social media. I always ask myself, what is the best thing? I tend to believe that the best thing is um, human interaction.

Speaker 1:          16:09          A lot of times I take a step back from like the political, the political argument about the conflict and all of that just because I feel like I'm worthy and that I don't know enough.

Speaker 3:          16:22          So it my way, I've always known what I, what I am in this conflict. I always knew I wanted to fight for peace. That's all I knew. And that's all I will ever know. I never was in the idea of this conflict until my father passed away. And then I had to think for myself.

Speaker 2:          16:41          I always was asking my father why he was born and his answer not to kill, to live, to be in life. And when my sister, she got killed, I went back to him to tell him. He told me that he was born to live. No. Okay. But my sister, she was born to die. They are a Palestinian, they didn't kill 6 million Israelis. And the Israelis is 10 [inaudible] 6 million Palestinian. There is a Germanian embassy in Tel Aviv and there isn't a German Israelis empathy and Germania. So it's a big hole. It's always gives me a hug. When I'm looking at this and thinking a little bit about this,

Speaker 5:          17:33          I'm going to say I think it's, it's, it's nice slogans. They just, I don't think that's the case. Israel has a peace treaty with Egypt because Egypt was willing to have peace with Israel. Israel has a peace treaty with Jordan because the Jordanians were willing to have a pastry with, with Israel.

Speaker 2:          17:47          Altaf run one to one. It's, it's different

Speaker 5:          17:50          how the way you think and the green, which is exactly why I don't believe in a, in a peace between the two sides because in my understanding of reality, the whole concept of Palestinian nationality because you don't accept Palestinians except human beings. I'm saying that the whole concept of destination reality is one goal and that is the violation of Israel. Um, when Jordan took over Judea and Samaria, when Egypt took over the Gaza and no one asks for a post,

Speaker 3:          18:14          you were combining every one. You're combining everyone into one ideology, which is not right. Why? What do you mean? You're saying because they're saying that they're Palestinians. This is what they want,

Speaker 5:          18:24          which is not true. I, I take it back and governments the Palestinian Authority. Okay. I'm not saying I agree. It's, it's different. I, I'm, I want to say, okay. We'll just, I don't refer to the Arabs and Dan's scenarios. [inaudible] they're referred to in this scenario. If we were going to live long, long gauge or [inaudible] we gonna see, we're gonna see each other. We, we're going to, we're going to have it. You can have it. No, no. I'm talking about peace. We're going to have it.

Speaker 4:          18:57          Yeah. Share with everyone. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          19:33          Hello. Hey guys. I'm Johnny. I'm a dog. I think that there's on top of some passion fruit juice, which gives the kick.

Speaker 5:          19:58          So how was the experience? For me, it was perfect. It was good. It was a good meeting.

Speaker 3:          20:08          It was topsy turvy. It was upside down if the Kenyan, yeah, like I say that because like you don't know who's was in front of you and you don't know their ideas. Do your ideology, what they think about you. I think we did come to some sort of an agreement that we both do one piece,

Speaker 5:          20:31          security freedom and prosperity. You were talking about legal piece. I don't want a piece of paper and it says peace. I want to live in peace. I don't want a piece of paper says we have a peace treaty but we don't agree because I don't believe in a Palestinian state and you think

Speaker 3:          20:48          you should have like a two state solution so we don't agree and it's, so let's say we wanted a one state solution Israel with everyone equal I'm, I'm fine with it. Yeah, exactly. Well I learned from you that you have a lot of sympathy for ass side as well. Even though your, your sister passed away, which is terrible. She didn't pass away. She wasn't married. But I can see that you also have sympathy for the other side and you actually are trying to, you know, communicate with us even though you went through everything that you had to go through on your end. And I definitely learned that we can learn to love your site as well or I could learn till that bureau side as well. I think this is the main 0.4 hour maybe conflict that we did not hear from each other. So I think it's important to hear from each other, not just keep your thoughts and ideas inside your head and don't try to Aventis box, just tried to open it.

Speaker 1:          21:48          We want really similar things. Um, yeah. And it's sort of, you feel like you know, my friends from back. And so the realization that we do have the same sort of language, not, not in like the language that we speak, but in our body language and the things that interest us in the future that we hold for ourselves and for families. Like there are no sides. Like I can't draw a line and say, okay, I'm like

Speaker 6:          22:19          these people or with these people,
