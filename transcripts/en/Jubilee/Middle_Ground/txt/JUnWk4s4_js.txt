Speaker 1:          00:00          What are you putting in your body? Dead carcass pain, suffering. Can I have all of my vegans go into that pool of light and my non vegans are in that pool?

Speaker 2:          00:26          First statement, taste plays a big factor in my eating choices.

Speaker 3:          00:35          Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:37          Yeah, I mean that's a huge thing for me. I think it's one of my weaknesses is actually like butter, salt. It's one of my weaknesses.

Speaker 1:          00:44          I love food and I think my relationship with food actually deepened when I became Vegan. I don't think I appreciated it as much as I did before. I was Vegan. My name is Ari Davis and I have been vegetarian for 24 years and Vegan for 13 years.

Speaker 2:          01:02          I believe that humans are the top of the food chain.

Speaker 4:          01:12          It's a human at the same level of equivalence is like a fish. Right. This is probably a big reason why I'm not vegan anymore. Right? Is I didn't, I couldn't, I didn't see that. I had to see myself at our moral equivalent of a fish and it gets into moral questions like, you know, why should we have a pet that's a dog rather than eat the dog? And I think the most important question is why should I love my neighbor rather than eat my neighbor? My name's Steve Michelle [inaudible]. I was a Vegan for a year. I was a vegetarian for two years. I am a mediator now. I've been so for over five years,

Speaker 2:          01:48          like I don't even see like what is like a food chain, you know what I'm saying? That's just some construct some guy made and put a little diagram and put us the human beings in the top. So

Speaker 1:          01:56          I don't think it's a question of whether we're at the top. I think it's a question of what do you do with that? If you have a more conscious energy than an animal, what do you do with that power? Do you choose to take a life or do you choose to live in

Speaker 3:          02:11          love?

Speaker 2:          02:14          I put a lot of thought into my meals.

Speaker 2:          02:20          The way I support my body and my health is extremely important. I don't find that I can function at my best either. Healthy, productive, emotionally stable, intellectually capable unless I have a lot of proper nutrients in my diet. Six years ago I became Vegan because I got sick. I started to realize that my health is directly attached to what I ate. Since then, my friends and family have supported me to feeling better and I'm better than I was before I got sick. Uh, I don't really like cook or anything, so I don't really put too much thought into what I eat. I guess I live a fast paced kind of like I'm working late nights or I'm waking up early. Sometimes it's easier

Speaker 4:          03:00          to grab this quick process sandwich or I wish I planned my meals out more. I think I would be a lot. I would feel a lot better.

Speaker 2:          03:08          I think it's will be powerful no matter what you're eating, to put your intentions into whether it's prayer in vocation and it's just such great power in presence versus just like scarfing something down. But like can I just really be present with this meal, take my time and chew it slowly. So that's the first one that I resonate with and what I choose. I would kill an animal.

Speaker 3:          03:32          Okay.

Speaker 4:          03:33          I think there'd be tons of context where I'd kill an animal. Like if a, if a lion is going to go kill a baby, I'd probably kill an animal. I'd kill an animal to save a human life and I get the vegans probably wouldn't do that if I could do something to prevent killing them besides eating them. Like if I was protecting myself and we had to, we had it like a something that we could do to get that animal away. I would definitely try to not kill it. I mean, I feel like it comes down to you or the animal. You're killing the animal. I would, I would.

Speaker 2:          04:05          They're going to give up their life for the fish. Why is it always the case when talking about what I kill an animal like exactly what you were in a client's wandering around downtown La when I was in the hiking. There's, there's mountain lions are coming kit and kill people. You've known that, right? That's an orange county, but that's not, that's not in the jungle in Africa. Did you kill an animal? It's an orange county. Mountain lions have killed hikers. Kids. What'd you just let them know? We'll let the guest die. We're hiking in the mountains and there's a mountain lion. I have to be aware of the fact that I'm in mountain lion territory and be like, I'm okay with the risk because to be honest, I'm not hiking with a gun. I have no way to defend my friend. Yeah, you don't hike with Nike, Paul?

Speaker 2:          04:48          I've been, I don't call against a mountain lion. I don't think your wedding, I just, I just want to say like even if I did and even if my attempt were to be successful, I would feel awful. Having killed the mountain lion. What were your feelings or your just foundation then for your beliefs then? 100% or if human beings, animals. Yes, yes, sure. Would you kill another human being to save another human being? Yes. What makes one person more valid as a student to another? Is it your relationship to that person? It would, yeah. It would probably be so if for example, I raise an animal in the wild, it's like an animal I've built a relationship with and that animal now threatens the life of a human being, but I don't know, but I have no man. It's entire life. What makes killing that animal as just cause. Okay. As opposed to saving that life. I have a, I have a longer relationship with that animal. Why would I kill the animal before I'd save that person? Like it's about relationship. You killed him. A person over an animal because I believe human beings are animals. NASA humans at a different level, but maybe a bell. He fish at the same level as a person. Hey, we see it very different. I do.

Speaker 2:          05:55          It costs more than it should eat healthy.

Speaker 4:          06:08          It's more expensive to eat healthy. I don't think it's too expensive. Farmer's market is something that I'm trying to frequent more. Oh. But sometimes you know, you can go spend $20 here and definitely not get as much. Um, I definitely want to see that, you know, maybe that'll encourage people to eat a little healthier if you can go grab that fresh fruit, fresh veggies for five, 10 bucks, you know,

Speaker 2:          06:31          I think, uh, our culture as a society is just in grade towards like the fast food culture. It was just cheap and accessible. But now I think we have more of a established like medical basis on what's healthy and what's not healthy. And to get that content and to have it be tasty as well is, is expensive.

Speaker 1:          06:52          I'm running it. I have so much to say. It does not cost more money to be Vegan. That is a myth. It takes planning. Yes. The convenience is last. Can you grab a hamburger at Mcdonald's for sure for 99 cents, but k how much lentils can you buy? The issue is capitalism. Like that is what is keeping us where we are. It's not that humans are smarter and they're going to come up with this technology. The technology exists. It is there. We can feed so many people. It is capitalism and factory farming

Speaker 2:          07:24          and most of these companies that are selling us products that are like shitty food, they don't give a fuck about you at all period. Someone sitting on the island somewhere. Oh yeah, like just stacking bread and then Paul this fast foods, she eating really healthy food and they probably even real good.

Speaker 1:          07:39          Yeah, they're not eating any of that shit.

Speaker 4:          07:41          You go to certain neighborhoods, certain areas you don't see the same fast food. You don't see the same restaurant and it's all for a reason. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          07:48          no stability. I mean, yeah, that's a good point. It's like they don't have, why is there many health food stores in the hood? I come, I can't like get an option wise is liquor store anywhere and it's true. It's like you have to, when you break it down there's like malicious intent to d harmonize and like lower the vibration of certain people and certain areas and it's like that's a part of it too. It's like, what am I contributing to? Sure. I'll say this. You know, when I was 11 years old, my father passed away from his second heart attack. He was diabetic. He was pissing out of a two by watching him deteriorate my youngest years of my life for like years and years, just a tear rate, taking pharmaceutical drugs and just kind of basically dying slowly because of what he chose to eight to me, I'd rather spend an extra dollar. I need her again, nick or something. Helping now and live longer. Then try to cut corners when you know

Speaker 1:          08:35          in the end twice now instead of later. In the end, my mom was same thing. She died. She was eating buckets of ice cream when she passed away. She died at 49 years old. Wow.

Speaker 3:          08:49          Now choose no,

Speaker 4:          08:51          the more education now we can put out there. Just like stuff like is beautiful.

Speaker 2:          08:56          That's what I was most anxious about is learning more of what I'm trying to step into. I don't know if I'll ever give up chicken. I'm just going to be honest with you. I don't know. I want to eat a lot cleaner chicken. Do you guys have like cheat days ever?

Speaker 1:          09:09          Hell No. I am Vegan 100% at the front line. Ethical reasons, always, always, always. And that's why I don't think in 24 years I've ever fought back.

Speaker 2:          09:20          It was hard to try new things. Things I didn't like, found a tons of feed and food. I was like, Oh God, what the fuck are you people eat it. And then simultaneously realizing that there was options. You know, there's always choices and it's always choices you make. Like you said, you may never give up me um, fully, but it's like you're making a choice to or at least thinking for yourself and making a decision. Then like that's all you can ask people to do is think for themselves. Really appreciate each and every one of you all. Thank you. No problem.

Speaker 1:          09:49          Thank you. Thank you.

Speaker 2:          09:53          No, thank you for coming out. Nice to meet you ladies. What's up guys? I have a Mari and I am Jason. And am I a question for you? You have a question for me. What do you like about middle ground?

That's right. I love that. All right, well tell us in the comments below why you love middle ground and if you've been a label they want to take off and throw on the ground, tell us that as well.
