Speaker 1:          00:00          Those are things we don't want in the United States. And one other thing,

Speaker 2:          00:03          predatory behavior,

Speaker 1:          00:06          I got mad at me, but if I could say this, it's not baked into their religion.

Speaker 2:          00:21          Trump's support supporters. Can I have you over there? My immigrants? Can I have you in the other leg?

Speaker 3:          00:27          Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:33          Sometimes I feel anxious about how the other side views me.

Speaker 3:          00:39          Hmm.

Speaker 4:          00:46          Uh, so it's not necessarily about the idea of immigrants, but I'm Muslim and there can be a lot of directed aggression from Trump supporters that I think I felt and other people in my Muslim community have felt. And that's why I'm here sitting with you guys.

Speaker 5:          01:02          I own a clothing line, maggot [inaudible]. This is my clothing line. I'm a political strategist and a political activist. And when I leave my house, I am in fear for my life because every day I get death threats. So I think we both should be able to freely express ourselves. I love everybody. I'm here for everybody. I'll fight for your right, for freedom. But I expect for you to fight for mine too, because that's why we're in America.

Speaker 4:          01:28          My name is [inaudible]. So I absolutely love immigration, but I believe that we need to secure our border. And it's the same thing of I wouldn't just let anyone in my car or in my house, alright, disagree has come on in.

Speaker 2:          01:42          I used to get anxious about how I'm perceived, not just by some quote unquote other side, because my identity is very apparent in standing in my truth. I think it allows other folks to stand in there as and to invite people to also learn more about me rather than be worried about how I'm perceived.

Speaker 4:          02:01          I think my group gets represented unfairly in the media.

Speaker 3:          02:11          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          02:12          well I'm a Mexican and I hesitated because when Trump said the things about Mexicans been criminals and all that, I, I didn't took it personal because I'm not that. So I was like, that does not represent me. Like don't take things personally. So that's why I hesitated. But then I'm like, I am not only one Mexican individual was an immigrant. I'm part of all the immigrants no matter what country you're from. Or we can say the same thing for Trump supporters. Right? I mean, now we have to, maybe I wasn't called a racist, but you are called racist. Well, guess what? We're both Trump supporters. So now we have to band together.

Speaker 1:          02:47          Could I, could I ask both of you a question and I'd like it. An honest reaction to this in my mind is languaging. I'm a writer and I think if we made a distinction between jihadists and Muslims that would solve

Speaker 4:          03:00          a big problem that's possible. And I think a lot of that goes into really the realm of how much people really are interested and understanding that kind of diversification and uh, allowing the community that does no, that really, um, I don't know, take the lead and a initiative and show other people what that's about. I feel threatened by this presidency.

Speaker 3:          03:23          Oh, that's interesting.

Speaker 2:          03:27          When president Trump got elected as president, I was scared even though I had not a reason to because I'm legal here, power becomes scary in hands of a monster. Power becomes scary and hence of ignorance and I'm scared about my people. And not only, like I said, the Mexicans, all the good hardworking immigrants. Right. Yeah. I think, um, the election night was when I felt alarmed. I've been a community organizer and an activist for 15 years now, right? That night it felt like a slap in the face to all of the work that we have always tried to do in terms of humanizing ourselves.

Speaker 4:          04:09          My name is Kyla shot. I think we realize as immigrants how lucky we are to be here and that's why we want to create a society that's more welcoming for others to be here.

Speaker 5:          04:19          You said it was a slap in the face, and I take offense to that because you were saying you worked so hard and yet we worked so hard to, to elect a president of the United States that we think will enforce the laws, will enforce the United States constitution and it wasn't to be racist or it wasn't to boot you out of the country and it was to enforce the first amendment. It's actually to enforce your freedom of speech. I understand why you're scared that as a white Trump supporter, I am scared of this presidency because I have lost my freedom of speech. I have lost my freedom of religion. I have lost my freedom to wear this shirt in the public just because I have a different political view. Now. I'm the enemy in my own country.

Speaker 2:          05:11          I think that that's unfortunate about happened to you, but it's almost like you have some semblance of the reality that people of color live with for centuries here, but I've never seen that and I've never the first time you felt that. Right, right. But I, I'm just going to let you,

Speaker 5:          05:24          no, that my neighbors are are black. I have Muslim neighbors. I have, I have neighbors of all kinds. When we go to the grocery store and I'm Picking Out Yogurt, I'm picking out yogurt. It looks like someone just like you,

Speaker 2:          05:34          but it doesn't mean that you experienced the same thing as me, even though we eat the same yogurt, but nobody

Speaker 5:          05:39          in my county treats people like that. It's just not. Thank

Speaker 2:          05:43          you. Would be able to say that I lived in Orange County up until a few months ago. If I'm at a mall or if I'm even at the beach. Right. I get a lot of strange stares. I even feel like a lot of people after the election came up to me asking me about my positions, my religion, my identity. So what I'm trying to say is like I can actually relate to what you went through because that to be honest is a shred of similarity to what people of color have always came here

Speaker 6:          06:11          when we were born basically. Sure. I believe in immigration, but I am against illegal immigration.

Speaker 3:          06:22          Yeah.

Speaker 6:          06:24          My whole thing is a assimilation, right? So like making sure that the cultures match. If you know someone in the Middle East who's gay will be killed. Right. That's the thing. And it's horrible. If someone would, that culture is somehow makes it through vetting and comes here and then sees a gay couple, you know, kissing or whatever, they're going to freak out or they're going to react very differently in a way that, you know, we're trying to move past or we're not trying to be held back by. So I believe assimilation is probably one of the most important factors of why we need legal, not illegal, immigrations. Okay.

Speaker 1:          06:57          My thing is about money or an awful lot of people who came here legally don't want illegal people being able to come or get free college. It costs $118 billion in welfare benefits. That's a huge, why do I have to pay so that Walmart has cheap workers. My name's Ken Unger. I don't have anything against him. I crunch. It's a political problem. It's not an immigrant problem.

Speaker 4:          07:25          I was an illegal immigrant. I at one point in my life, I am not anymore. But ultimately we left the country of war, a country where extremism and terrorism was a reality. And this is something that was on a daily oppression towards women.

Speaker 5:          07:39          Um, and if we don't have legal immigration and we'll have that here, we want you to come and be safe. But don't you want that for everyone else? Does it matter where you're coming from? Okay.

Speaker 4:          07:52          I think it might be a misconstrued and, or a misconception to think that the illegal immigrants might bring up the crime rates. And when we're talking about, uh, what happens, uh, after immigrants or refugees or illegals and anything come into the state and how can we help them from here? I think that is the real essential question. We have a humanitarian duty to help one another out regardless of f where I've gotten a four, it's fairly, if we're American, we're all humans ultimately. Right?

Speaker 5:          08:19          So, fantastic. What about our backs? What about our children that are starving? What about our foster homes that are full? What about them? We're not helping them. Where we're taking in all these refugees. If we can't fix our citizens, how can we fix others? It's just kind of like, if I can't love myself, I can't love another person.

Speaker 6:          08:38          It should be easier to immigrate into America.

Speaker 3:          08:42          Hmm.

Speaker 6:          08:49          It should be easier. The wait time should be shorter. Right? But I believe that it's so lengthy. Not because the process is so extreme. I mean, personally I think it's so lengthy because it's mismanaged. I think that like the cookie jar, well that too, but I think it's just like there's a way in a process that should be put in place. So it's not 15 years, let's say that they fully cooperate. Right? Let's say they have everything. They have all their documents and they're ready. Yeah. I think it should be

Speaker 2:          09:17          be a lot shorter. You can make it less bureaucratic. Yeah, basically. Okay. I mean, I think I would agree with that. I just feel like when it comes to Trump, you support the individual, but then the bureaucracy, the administration, all of that is so painstaking, just so inefficient. And in all of this, it doesn't really compute for me.

Speaker 6:          09:38          I think I'm only been in there a year. Right? Yeah. And we have so many changes that we want to make. So let's talk about

Speaker 2:          09:44          well, of policy things. What about the Muslim man or the travel ban?

Speaker 6:          09:48          The travel ban to me was more of a, well, it was something that was correct, but it was enacted by Trump. Don't, don't get me wrong. I agree with the travel ban. Right. And I agree with refugees, but that's two separate things to me.

Speaker 2:          10:02          So what I'm trying to say is that none of these policies that are happening are not to do with one another. They're all intertwined. When we say we support the travel band, but we also support refugees, but we also want to like help them get back to the nations and we also want to do that. So we always want to, well, don't forget, we're funding the same bombs that are causing the Yemenis to have to be [inaudible].

Speaker 6:          10:23          I'm rob. There has to be a reason, right? So it's all connected. Right? So, so why are we bombing Yemen? Personally, I haven't looked into Yemen.

Speaker 2:          10:32          I guess I'm missing your point. Refugees. He support. Yes. Travel ban. Muslim ban. You support. It's not, it's not a Muslim. Yes, I support a travel ban so we can assess who's coming in. I just think it's important to contextualize like your thing. Nothing happens in a vacuum. Right. And I think that if we start to actually connect the dots like I'm encouraging us to do, then it'll become a lot more understandable. I mean, I don't believe in bombing anyone.

Speaker 1:          10:59          I would like to answer your question about why we're bombing Yemen. We're not bombing Yemen were bombing radical jihadists in Yemen who are killing people. That's why we're bombing parts of Yemen selectively to kill people who are doing terrible, terrible things. And there's a tremendous amount of rape happening in England taking these little girls, grooming them because they feel they have the right to do. We don't want that here. Those are things we don't want in the United States. And one of the things that's it,

Speaker 2:          11:30          predatory behavior,

Speaker 6:          11:32          excuse me, we don't want know if I could say this and you'll get mad at me, but if I could

Speaker 1:          11:37          say this, it's not baked into their religion. There are 109 passages in the Korean where people are told to kill infidels and and Christians and Jews. There's nothing like that in our Bible or the Bhagavad Gita or in anything Buddha taught or any other religion I'm aware of in the world until people renounce those values, right?

Speaker 6:          12:02          Then they scare me.

Speaker 2:          12:05          I don't think so. I haven't renounced any part of my religion in front of you, so I hope that you don't feel threatened by me, so I'm not sure what you mean by that and I won't renounce any part of Islam. The point that I'm trying to make is that you didn't really answer the question. No, he did. He said the reason why we're bombing on Yemen is to save the people. Cause I'm assuming that in Yemen and we've got some bad guy to keep out. People like that. Guys remember this, a video of a Trump and immigrants. We're mixing too much. The religion, the race, but you shouldn't question somebody's religion. I am very religious, very religious and I'm not putting anything about my religion in here. I'm here to talk about me as an immigrant. What you guys are here to talk about Donald Trump's like supporting him.

Speaker 2:          12:54          Sure. And yes, I've learned a lot. Like you guys are human too. You have values. You who would have thought, you know, that we would have found common ground and we wouldn't like hit each other right here. You know, because up there, the media with train you guys as bad or was this terrorist, whatever. Right. I think the media is portraying us all in a different light. Yeah. I think that we're portraying ourselves in a very different light too. I mean I feel very attacked just now for my religion when I did fix that. Talking about myself as an immigrant. Yes, that's what I'm saying. You kept talking about the travel ban is a Muslim ban that has to do with immigration. It's not a Muslim ban, but what I'm trying to just say is that no one should have to explain Muslim, Christian, Jewish, none of the above what they are too, but Muslims continuously have to defend not only their religion but their humanity.

Speaker 6:          13:46          What I love about this country is the diversity. I just, when I came here from Mexico, I just love how there was different religions, different callers, different people. Like it's amazing. It's, it's beautiful and I, I don't, I don't understand how empty I'm a human. You have to be to discriminate someone just because of their looks to assume it's these preprogram thoughts in our head from just media is what I believe. Just blowing things out of proportion. Just consistently, just outlook on minorities or the outlook on people in certain situations. It's just bad. Once you humanize someone, when you're having a conversation and I look past whatever these biases that people try to enact on me. Right? Or of that I see and I started looking at you as a person. I start listening to what you're saying. You really realize that it's not that different. I mean we're just, we have different situations, we have different information, but we're all trying to do the best that way

Speaker 2:          14:45          have. I think the real interesting aspect that I guess a lot of discrimination is really about is taking this idea of the

Speaker 4:          14:52          phenomenon where you can associate my case at least like Muslims, terrorists equal each other and take individuals and group them so easily with that sort of discrimination and I think that's something that we have to work towards in terms of separating ourselves from doing that. Thank you everybody. I appreciate you all.
