Speaker 1:          00:00          I went in there with just wanting a nose job and my lips done and he made me feel like my entire face was messed up. I left in tears because I felt I am so hideous.

Speaker 2:          00:55          have my natural beauty folks on the left and my cosmetic surgery group on the right.

Speaker 3:          01:04          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:10          the cosmetic surgery industry exploits people's insecurities.

Speaker 1:          01:22          I don't think the industry as a whole does it's money, right? So I think there are, there's the motivation behind women not feeling good about themselves. And I do think there are certain companies and individuals who would exploit that in order to make it more lucrative for them. It just makes sense. That's how businesses work. Some places where they tell you like bring out those insecurities because I want them to buy these products. You mean like in a training they tell you that. Right, and I'm not going to do that to someone is like, oh well you have this, this and this wrong. Maybe you want to fix it. I'm not going to do that to somebody and create an insecurity in them that maybe they knew they had and not playing on it or maybe they didn't know, but now they do. Definitely. I was only 18 when I called from my console. I said I would like to have a consult for a rhinoplasty and lip injections and he gave me the, I needed chicken plans. I needed to have my brow line shaved down because changing my nose would change the entire shape of my fees and I felt very much so like he just saw me as money.

Speaker 3:          02:32          Okay.

Speaker 4:          02:33          There's good doctors and bad doctors and in the end, the important thing to realize is that doctors are trying to do good for other people. There's exceptions, but it's a professional society where our goal is to help other people and you know, initially going in to the cosmetic world especially, um, it's a multibillion dollar industry and as a doctor you're always taught a couple of laurels from benevolence to do no harm.

Speaker 1:          03:00          Insecurity is inherent in all of us. Some of us have more, some of us have less, but it was already there and you know, does the cosmetic industry capitalize on our insecurities? Sure. I think that there is a piece of that, but as all industries that are just trying to market to the people that are going to utilize it, right. Product, I wish I could change something about my appearance.

Speaker 1:          03:27          Yeah. I feel like, um, just because I want to change something about myself doesn't necessarily mean that I don't accept myself. Those are the thoughts that prompt me to, to work on acceptance of myself. Something that I come across a lot in my practice is not so much that someone wants to change the way that they look, but they want to preserve it. There's a lot of issues, especially with women with the aging process. It's not so much that they want to be somebody else, so they want to look like somebody else, but they want to stay looking like them. I fully intend to do a facelift when the time is right and not because I want to look different, but because I want to continue to look as young as I feel. Yeah. I think for me, um, major decision for me to get cosmetic surgery was that I was in my early twenties and I had had a massive weight loss. I naturally lost the weight. Um, I lost 175 pounds and my skin looked like a nine year old. So for me, I consider it more like reconstructive and, um, kind of getting back to what I was supposed to be before I did some damage to myself.

Speaker 1:          04:46          For me. Um, I spent my entire childhood and into my early adult life wishing I looked different. I promised myself that I would never, ever tell myself I wish I had this. I wish I looked like this because I found that triggered, um, things for me that brought back places that I used to be with my eating disorder. I think that's great, and I hope you don't take offense to this, but you're gorgeous. And I feel like if I was okay, if I was naturally that, like beautiful, it wouldn't be that hard to like be like, oh my God, my face is gorgeous. You know, I'm going to accept myself. There are people who have facial deformities and embodied to, for me, it's like w kind of what I consider what I went through. It's a little harder. Yeah. Oh, definitely. Yes. Might have a pretty face, but I was always the largest of all of my friends, the largest of my family, five years of my life. I spent constantly, constantly waking up in the morning and picking apart every single part of my body. I can't continue this constant, terrible habit of bulemia or I'm going to die. Yeah. Okay, good. Just I was horribly believing for a year and a half, like it was awful. Yeah. So I got it. Yeah. Yeah. It's not easy.

Speaker 1:          06:02          Cosmetic surgery can empower you. I do wish that every woman could wake up and look in the mirror and be like, I am so beautiful just the way I am. But I also think that if you can do something to give yourself that feeling, then that's really great and that, that is a beautiful thing.

Speaker 4:          06:25          So one of the questions we actually asked on our questionnaires, what are your motivations for surgery? And someone who says, I can't get a boyfriend. You know, I'm getting bad grades because I have this particular look, they're a bad candidate for surgery. And you know, that's part of medical school training. That's part of becoming a surgeon is understanding what these triggers are. What are the signs that tell you as a surgeon, this is not going to be someone who's going to be happy afterwards,

Speaker 1:          06:47          whether or not you are inherently truly happy or not. I think that's hugely important. But what if you're a happy person but you hate your nose or would if you're a very happy person and you were born with a cleft palate and you want to be able to project your image to the world that's congruent with how you feel on the inside and maybe you're experiencing negativity because of the way you were born. Naturally

Speaker 4:          07:16          every day. I experience stories of empowerment with patients, but for me a particular one comes essentially from someone who was so

Speaker 3:          07:26          okay.

Speaker 4:          07:26          Unempowered by her experiences. This girl, uh, she was 23 at the time, um, was beat by her father when she was younger and sustained significant trauma to her nose and helping her and fixing her nose and the gratitude she showed and realizing that you didn't help her for that day. You didn't help her for that week. It's for the rest of her life. She, it, she can start moving on. And that empowerment is one of, is a perfect example of what cosmetic surgery. And that truly was that it was just a cosmetic surgery. It was not so she could breathe. It wasn't so she could move around better. It was to make her look a certain way so she doesn't have to remember that experience.

Speaker 1:          08:05          There's too much pressure on women to look a certain way.

Speaker 1:          08:14          We live in a instant life now with, you know we have dating apps or you can swipe hundreds of people a day and you know, you can go online and post a good selfie of yourself and get you know, hundreds of likes and you feel like there's so much pressure to look and be a certain way, like you can never fall. Kind of looked at the way that things have changed around pregnancy. A lot of women now want to go and have a baby with a beat face. Like everything's perfect. It's about the perfect picture. I have to have my makeup and my brows now. I understand some things. You just want to be perfect. I get it. I want to, I want to be able just embrace the moments with my child and not worry about all this makeup. I have one right now.

Speaker 1:          09:02          I think we've been kind of comparing, you know, say the 25 year old to the 25 year old, but then let's think about the women that are middle aged and are having to keep up with the younger girls, it to try and still feel attractive and relevant. And I do see that a lot, even with my clientele. I have women that are married to very wealthy men. Yeah. And that their greatest fear is that they will end up becoming the second wife because the new and improved wife is on her way in and she's on her way out. So this pressure to maintain youth and beauty and relevance is so huge for not really realizing that it's that men, there's a jerk and it's like, it's my, it's not the, it's not us. It's really the person that you're with. And so I think that always happened to keep up with the Joneses and always wanted to just like, I have to look this way because this person has to love me and if this person doesn't love me, I'm going to have to, I have to make myself be who he loves to take it to.

Speaker 1:          10:09          A lot of pressure.

Speaker 3:          10:11          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          10:12          I am beautiful.

Speaker 3:          10:18          Okay.

Speaker 1:          10:19          Okay. So I'm going to go first because I woke up this morning and I really loved myself with me having a bit of Lego. It took a long time. When I first was diagnosed at five, no one knew what it was. Everyone thought Michael Jackson made it up. It's a real thing. No one knew that it was real. So a lot of people's first time encountering would it actually look like in person was me. I took a long time for me to get to this point. So where I'm just like, oh, I love who I am. I'm super beautiful for things that I do. Not particularly how I look, how cute he is ever. You know, my browser. Nice. And you know, that's it. But I feel still beautiful for the way that I make other people feel and just hike how I love myself. One of the things that happened with me, um, gaining the weight really fast and then losing it really fast as I have a lot of stretch marks. I have a friend who's really into body positivity and um, she's a photographer and she took pictures of these ugly parts of me and she's just like, wow, that is so beautiful. And like I could see through her eyes, like I'm starting to see myself in that way. Even those things that will never get fixed, there is no way to fix them. There was no way to replace my skin with other skin. It's different, but it's beautiful.

Speaker 4:          11:36          There's one message that I wanted to get out to men today. A simple thing like someone telling you, you look beautiful without being creepy, of course. Um, but someone just telling you, you look beautiful. All of you guys look beautiful. That makes a big difference to everyone and tell people they're beautiful because men are beautiful too. Correct.
