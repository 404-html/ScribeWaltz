Speaker 1:          00:00          We actually aren't looking for a middle ground with capitalism. We're not looking for a lighter, gentler oppression, exploitation, racism. We are seeking revolution.

Speaker 2:          00:11          Yeah. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:32          My name is liberty. I'm studying psychology at Ucla. I'm 20 years old.

Speaker 3:          00:36          I'm Sean. I'm 24 years old and I'm in the Socialist Party.

Speaker 1:          00:41          My name's Mimi. Uh, 2016. I was the Socialist Party's presidential candidate. Uh, um, Shea and I'm with the Socialist Party and I'm 28. My name is Jack. I'm 19. I go to community college and name's Richard 19. I go to cal state long beach as a chemistry major with a music minor. Hey, get my socialists on the left and Mike Capitalists on the right.

Speaker 2:          01:10          Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:11          Humans are inherently selfish. Selfishness is sort of one word for it, but looking out for yourself, your own survival in your own gain. Um, and of course that includes the gain of those you love is one of the main motivators of people. A really good way that we could figure out human nature is by comparing it to animal nature and stuff like that. And you see, you know, animals doing whatever they can to survive. It's just culture that has changed us. But I believe at its core that yes, humans just like any other animal or I sell fish.

Speaker 2:          01:50          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:53          I work with children and my experience of working with people who haven't been a culture made it or have done in into this idea that they need to be selfish all the time are generally not every organism has to have a sense of like getting resources for itself and we're just survive. But that's a much different than being selfish I think.

Speaker 1:          02:13          I think even if you look at, if you spend any time in a social democracy, you know, let's say you go to Norway and you spend time there where the people see, um, the collective good, uh, as tied into their own personal wellbeing. You know, I think we have so many examples like that societies working collectively toward a greater good. The thing about the Nordic countries and my opinion is, well, since there's very, very ethnically homogenous, they all have very, very similar culture. It's not an accurate representation of what humans inherently are. Because I believe that culture can mask um, human nature. So you think that that diversity would work against working in harmony towards a collective good

Speaker 4:          03:00          in diversity? We have different ideas of what good is.

Speaker 3:          03:05          I think competition brings out the best in people, especially when you know we're competing for something like let's try to come create this compound that could help you know, the masses and some kind of health relation form. You have all these research labs trying to figure out what's the most efficient way to figure out this process. What's the most efficient way to do this? I think we need more of that sort of sense of competition, especially in the sciences and whatnot.

Speaker 4:          03:36          You know, we frequently hear about the evils of monopolies. It's because you know, with, when you control an entire market, why even bother being better, anything. You've got no competition, you've got nothing to strive for and and no one can choose anything else. I agree with you both on the examples that you gave, but the thing that I'm kind of struggling with, I mean if we're talking about efficiency, quality, then yeah, I think it brings out the best in people, but then again, it tends to bring about greed.

Speaker 2:          04:08          Okay.

Speaker 1:          04:08          Y'All do a such a great service. Uh, it's, it's a trip to me because as you're likely aware that there's this growing support for socialism and economic system that places people over profit that you're willing to continue to throw out the same talking points that have failed people so miserably. Uh, again, it's, it's a benefit to us and I guess we should say thank you.

Speaker 4:          04:33          Nice.

Speaker 3:          04:34          If you care about something, if you're passionate about something, you don't need the threat of someone doing it better than you to do the best that you can do. Ask any creative competition leads less to excellence and more towards doing whatever you can. Did edge past the other person.

Speaker 4:          04:51          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          04:51          Today everyone has the opportunity for success.

Speaker 2:          04:59          Yes.

Speaker 3:          05:01          All right. If we're talking about the United States and we're talking about financial success, then yes, I would believe so. If we're talking about the world, it doesn't necessarily have to mean financial wellbeing or like stability. I think that it really just means how you're happy and how you're okay with yourself and you know, you make a goal and you pursue your goal and if you fail or a t exactly what I was thinking. I find that there are so many resources out there that you can enact on. It's just, there's some people who just don't do anything about it.

Speaker 2:          05:32          Okay.

Speaker 1:          05:33          My first thought here with this collection is, you gotta be fucking kidding me. Uh, you know, um, so many people in this country who solely because they exist, they're under threat. Whether it's through, you know, the police, they're just trying to survive. So

Speaker 4:          05:50          everyone's very different. Again, everyone has different communities to what they can even consider a success in, in the u s though are a lot of opportunities for most people though. Of course, you can't say all and there are always those who are extremely unfortunate and GB helped.

Speaker 3:          06:07          I'm sure every one of us was sat in a restaurant before Starbucks. Those people who work their asses off any of these low income jobs are not easy and they work for pennies. If something goes wrong with their car, they're done. You know, if they have a health problem, they're done. You're, you're talking about financial success though. Success is extremely relative and can be defined in many different ways in a capitalist society that wasn't financial success, the most important thing. No, I, I've worked in the food industry for a number of years and I can not say that any one of my companions was ever happy to be doing. And if they're going to school on top of that, you know, so they're, they're working full time and on top of that they're going to school and their pants school, I would consider that successful. If you can go to school and you can maintain your GPA and you can also be working a part time job and somehow affording your school. Yeah, you're doing well in life, society should help the underprivileged.

Speaker 2:          07:13          Okay.

Speaker 4:          07:13          That sort of saying, give a man a fish, etc. Holds true. Um, and also who should do the helping and how is very important, not all acts of service are equally beneficial.

Speaker 3:          07:28          I would agree to that. I myself, you know, I'm sorry to use a personal anecdote, anecdotes here, but I've personally dealt with the fact that, oh, giving someone this much aid, they become, they become lazy. My father is an alcoholic, so we, since due to an injury in his leg, he gets SSI and what's in, what ends up happening is he receives enough SSI to the point where he's not, he's not motivated to do anything else beyond just going home drinking a beer or something like that. And I think, yes, people should help people, especially if they're under underprivileged or they need the resources to push them put to what end. That's, that's the fine line. But your personal anecdote only only covers the small demographic of the, of the alcoholic. Most of the people that, that, that uh, oh boy

Speaker 4:          08:20          you guys have brought up has been specifically about people who are particularly poor when most of the country is middle, lower middle class and up hats. Lots. Actually, that's not a fact that you would focus on this. And a con in a shitty one that gives more than half of its budget to the police in a country that just passed the military bill, a spending bill that's almost $1 trillion, that money goes to defense contractors. Government paying for things is not capitalism, but we're in a capitalist, uh, where the government pays huge amounts of money for the military. You're talking driver of those things. How about instead of spending the money on the military, how about putting those back into basic means? Healthcare, education, housing. I agree. The government taking our taxpayer dollars and funneling it into they're paying for things at the military explicitly says that they don't need, that's not capitalism is about prices and transparency and, and choices. When we got him and takes her money and buys it, they decided to blow some working. That is not, that might be what you call capitalism. But when I come here and say, well, I'm a capitalist, I'm not saying I'm in favor of that

Speaker 3:          09:36          profit. An ethics are opposing motives.

Speaker 1:          09:45          So I think at it's core to profit, uh, you have to exploit. Uh, and again there is nothing ethical about exploitation.

Speaker 3:          09:53          Yeah. I mean I can't think of, I, I'm really having trouble thinking of a situation where someone could profit off of something with that expectation being in the mix and I just, I, I'm running out of ideas. If you're running a business and you know, you're, you're the one up top, you would obviously walk away with more money if you pay your employees a little bit less.

Speaker 3:          10:17          I think that profit in ethics can be intertwined when seen with the corporate social responsibility module, when they treat their employees better, they give them more benefits. They raise their wages and in turn it motivates the workers to work harder. And treating your employees better than shit is not necessarily ethical like raising the quality. It does not mean that you've phrased it to a sufficient standard of, of treatment. Because if you're paying someone less than a living wage, that is unethical. All I'm saying is it is to some degree, more ethical and can be seen as more ethical to be beating competition by raising the wages of your employees and giving them better benefits.

Speaker 4:          11:04          I'll also, one must be paid slightly less than they are making in worth for a company for it to be worth it, to hire them at all.

Speaker 1:          11:15          If you can't pay your employee the minimum amount of money that they need in order to live a, you have no business being in business. Um, and I think also there's a tendency from the conservative side to skew away from sort of objective fact. I mentioned the MIT living wage calculator, right? Yes. That's a scientific model. Wow. That 29 25 so as a company, if you can't afford to pay your employees a living wage, that's just the minimum that they need in order to live. Right. Ah, get the fuck out of business. Why are we even talking to you when you have all the facts and we don't know anything? I don't know. Hardly worth my time. Well, we would,

Speaker 3:          11:54          sure it's hard to really lean towards one side or the other if everyone is just sort of stating all these coherent biases and not accepting any sort of thing from any other particular side, which is why I'm sort of just, I'm trying to understand your side and I'm trying to understand, grasp really my side of it. And again, going back to sort of that mutual understanding of what can we do next, that sort of mutual understanding needs to be there. If, if we're going to ever continue to see what's best for, for the US.

Speaker 1:          12:34          Well I think one reason why, you know, you often see like folks in the left and socialist communist, anarchist, sir, et Cetera, uh, they're so passionate and there is anger, you know, um, seeing the suffering and the oppression and the exploitation, the racism, et Cetera. You're sort of feel this urgency, you know, like we're constantly under sort of this self criticism and self reflection about like, well how do you package what can be complex ideas into ways that are very palatable. And I think every hour and I think like if there is a failure on the left, that would be one of them.

Speaker 3:          13:10          I wish that rather than having an agenda that we try to prove and we see ourselves as a winning by convincing the opponent, I wish that we could consider winning as finding the middle ground and finding where we're similar and finding the truth. I think if you're in the pursuit of truth, then you've won contrary to convincing other people that you're right. You know? Despite that we definitely disagree on pretty much everything. It's good to know. The real common ground here is where's is like millennials and Gen z and stuff. We're actually, we're actually like talking about this, like whether we were able to convince the other side of anything or not, at least we give a shit about it. You know? This is stuff that we needed to talk about this, this stuff that we need to be aware of, especially given our leaders. So.

Speaker 4:          13:57          All right guys. That's a wrap. Thank you. Really do. You're cool people.

Speaker 2:          14:07          Okay.
