Speaker 1:          00:00          The phrase all lives matter was derived from black lives matter to subvert black lives matter. And I won't come here and sit down and say that that's okay.

Speaker 2:          00:17          And I have, I law enforcement go to the left pool of life, had my black lives matter orders go to the right pool of light.

Speaker 3:          00:38          I regularly fear for my life.

Speaker 4:          00:42          Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:46          You know, I'm an army patrol officer, so I do. We were responsive burglar alarms though. If someone breaks into someone's house, have a gun, I would have to respond to that certain situation. So I do fear for my life in a way, I guess you can say I do something that I think every black man, every black person in this country, many people of color have been trained to do. And that's when the law enforcement officer gets behind me and I'm driving. I'm making sure I'm signaling, I'm checking my speed. I'm thinking of all the different legitimate ways that you could stop me. And in that moment I recognized and I realize that I'm not a scholar with a bachelor's in political science, a bachelor's in sociology, a master's in public policy. In that moment, I'm just another black man to that officer and that scares me.

Speaker 5:          01:36          I, I've maybe could have stepped forward. I feel scared for my life when I'm at work. Often when you get pulled over and all the thoughts and things that are going through your mind. Well, where when I pull a car over, I'm thinking about where I'm at on the highway, how I'm going to pull this vehicle over. Did I run the plate? Did it come back to that vehicle? Am I buckled in? Might not buckled in because most officers are shot and killed during traffic stops. And as I approached, I put my hand on that car to leave my hand print because if I'm shot and killed, that person is further incriminated by the evidence of my prints being on their car. But I don't feel afraid for my life as a citizen that at work I definitely do. And that's

Speaker 3:          02:13          the choice I made. I, I choose not to live in fear. Uh, if the question was do I feel less safe now than I did five years ago, I would say yes. And I think that that's because we have rampant social chaos that's expanding. And I think that that's playing a large role in a lot of the trends that we're seeing. What do you mean by social chaos? Um, out of wedlock birth rates, uh, statistically, you know, that sets a trial back five times more likely to be poor in nine times more likely to drop out of school and 20 times more likely to end up in prison. I mean, the cast that I'm seeing more recently is white men walking into schools with ar fifteens and slaughtering people. Yeah. And then w and then that is what you're seeing and what you're not seeing is the dozens of homicides that occur in Chicago on a daily basis. And that

Speaker 6:          03:00          speaks to, um, certainly a media that's desirous to push an agenda and a narrative that factual, he knows a bear out there is a massive disparity between black crime and white crime and large. And obviously that's going to lead to accelerated interactions with law enforcement. This specific, the criminalization of black people. When you have more police officers patrolling a concentrated area, then of course you have more stops. You have more, you know, situations where police officers say, oh, they didn't signal and then when I pulled them over I pulled all occupants out of the car. I searched the car, I found this gun allegedly buried somewhere and all of a sudden now you have a crime as a public defender. The the reputation is that you know, I'm going to lose most of my cases. I have one far more cases than I have lost. My name is Elissa Blair. I am African American. I'm also a criminal defense attorney. As a public defender, I've seen the mistreatment of my clients. I see the disproportionate incarceration of black and brown people and I see the excessive force used in arrests. Police should be given more resources. I think police should definitely be given more resources so that they have other options besides killing people. Officers should have the resources available to them to handle a situation without casualty on either side.

Speaker 5:          04:34          Yeah, I mean, as an officer I, I appreciate hearing that from a member of the public and from a public defender and can speak to it for myself and my department and what I've seen in other departments in the area and know that we need more resources and different types of training, communication techniques to deescalate situations and different types of least force option techniques. But as a small woman, I also want to be able to physically protect myself and it's, it's a hard balance.

Speaker 1:          05:09          The largest expense for almost every municipality and county is public safety. There's plenty of money, but we don't have is enough implicit bias training. The things that we carry about ourselves that define how we interpret who we're interacting with, our judgment. We don't have enough contextualizing of the communities that you're serving. Draw officers from the communities from which they serve. That way when they go back and they are policing their own community, that's deeper than just the race of the officer. So you think that black police officers need to be trained to be more sensitive to the black communities? That what you're saying? No, I think black officers that are policing black community should come from those communities. And I think a white officer who comes from that community might even be more effective than a black officer from somewhere else.

Speaker 6:          05:55          I agree. And I think, I think that this is a great point, which is that an officer, a white officer, a black officer, a female officer, a Hispanic officer, could be just as good as any other or better. And that's because there are things other than skin color. And I think that what's so concerning amount this dialogue is that it is pushing us further back into black communities, white communities. When really I thought that the goal of Martin Luther King, what does that we're going to be moving to a society where we were being judged by the content of our character. If we keep moving further into identifying based on our groups, I think that we're doing a disservice to his message, which I think was very powerful. And that United the country in many ways, but not at the time in Martin Luther King's time. White folks hated him. It causes me to Bristle. And and have an emotional reaction whenever somebody says, you know, black people are killing folks 50% and violent crimes and then says Martin Luther King United the country, Martin Luther King would be down for black lives matter

Speaker 5:          06:56          the next day. It is,

Speaker 6:          06:59          I believe that all lives matter. It's a little bit surprising below all of this stuff, below skin deeper than all of this, there is a intrinsic God given life that's put inside of all of us. I think that it's concerning that any movement would reject the fundamental premise of that while preaching for quality. Exactly. At that point, and you're really not in a quality movement if you're really only interested in speaking to your specific group.

Speaker 1:          07:34          I truly believe in, I agree with everything that you say. Everyone deserves life and I believe that, you know, life is a gift. Plain and simple, all life counts. It's all life matters. All life deserves a chance.

Speaker 4:          07:47          No.

Speaker 5:          07:49          Yeah. I think that especially in this platform but also in the world and the country that we live in today, stating that all lives mattered, takes away from the inequality that's happening in the world. Of course all lives matter. It negates the fact that something has to be addressed and if you don't address it and you don't recognize that there is a problem that has to be changed, then you never fucking change it. That's not our intention. Our intention was just to answer a simple question, but it's not. Not Everything is the same and not everything is the same.

Speaker 1:          08:24          You all lives matter. If you asked me if all lives have intrinsic value, if all lives are valuable, if all lives are worthy, I would have said hell yes it would have been the first one in my chair. All lives matter is a specific phrase similar to blue lives matter and anything else that mattered after black lives were exclaimed to have mattered to the track, to appropriate, to subvert the message in the framing and the narrative that's being brought to us by the black lives matter movement. So I don't think anybody here in this room thinks that any life is less worthy than another's. But the phrase all lives matter was derived from black lives matter to subvert black lives matter. And I won't come here and sit down and say that. That's okay.

Speaker 3:          09:09          I mean I feel like we're just kind of going into the weeds here. Question was in the black lives matter is a simple question. Do you believe that all lives matter? I don't think that that's an interesting phrase. A phrase. I think that you frequently, I think not really. I think that you can attach it right after. That's what I try and step back from, you know, whatever sort of identity, political stuff we have going on. And I try and deal with things head on based on reality. And when someone says to meet, do you think all lives matter? I answer unequivocably yes. Every time. The same way. If you asked me a black lives matter or female lives matter, I will answer the same way you do. Black lives matter. Yes they do. I had conflicting feelings about coming here today.

Speaker 4:          09:54          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          09:55          For me, I was conflicted because I, I don't feel like I should speak for black oppression, but as a white woman, um, I think that I can be a value to other white people who may not understand. I'm Sandra crews and well, I'm from the 60s and I went to jail a lot for fighting for women's rights and as a human being, I think it's important that I speak out and speak up for injustices.

Speaker 5:          10:24          I'm feeling conflicted now as someone who steps into the law enforcement side as if we are on opposite sides. Um, I am a law enforcement officer and a black lives matter supporter. I find myself searching for what to do and how to make a difference. And I've had moments of thinking about leaving the force. I finally had a realization that this gives me an opportunity to have a different angle as a white woman and also as a police officer to potentially make a difference even if it's just with changing myself.

Speaker 3:          11:03          I didn't hesitate. I've been a civilian my entire life and I consider it an honor to have an opportunity to provide voice for law enforcement. And the men and women that serve our communities. I think it's fundamentally important for society to respect law enforcement men and women that serve our communities with tremendous honor and distinction end up getting a bad rap. I think that that's very harmful.

Speaker 6:          11:26          I think that it is important. I think it's imperative to speak whenever you have an opportunity to, and I think that all of us in whatever movements were part of or whatever belief systems were part of should use our gifts.

Speaker 5:          11:44          You know deescalation training is sitting in a room like this with a PowerPoint and walking officers' through scenarios and nothing. Nothing in a scenario is ever going to be like the real world in defensive officer's like only those of us that walk in the shoes of having a badge and a gun and being in these high stress situations can really articulate what it's like to make these split second decisions with our training officers need to be in these types of discussions. Owning their shit and being like, I did this wrong and I have this prejudice and how can I sit with people who can teach me and change me?

Speaker 3:          12:21          This is what I think is sort of dangerous about a conversation like this. Is that really the only thing that I want law enforcement being trained on is the law. Okay. Um, this nebulous conversation about thinking about how I think about things and yeah,

Speaker 5:          12:35          some of us in law enforcement think of ourselves as social workers with a gun. And that's concerning because your, your job is to enforce the law as someone in the field who wants more deescalation training. It's not because I don't believe in a lot of the laws that I enforce and it is my job to enforce the law. I'm not allow warning officer, that's not what I signed up to do. But we are given the discretion to make choices. And that's why we need more training because we're human beings. Just in my perspective, and I appreciate your support of law enforcement and your perspective.

Speaker 3:          13:13          Yeah. And I and I appreciate your perspective as well as your, your real service that you've done so and I don't want it. We are disagreements. Certainly don't take away from my respect and admiration for your service.

Speaker 1:          13:23          Let's thank you for this. We all respect the service of everyone who works to the service of others. I don't think anybody in this room is against individual officers. The conversation is to take a step back and recognize that this institution is a relic of Anglo policing from European culture but also slave catching and deep rooted racism in American policy and we need to take that step back and re sent to this conversation on the fact that it's bigger than just an officer.

Speaker 5:          13:59          I think part of the problem is that we're still so segregated. Where do we go to have these conversations? Where do we go to learn from each other to break down the stereotypes? It's systemic and I'm so thrilled that there's a black lives matter movement. It's really exciting.

Speaker 7:          14:19          Guys. Thank you so much. I know this hasn't been an easy one, but I appreciate your time. Feel free to continue the discussion. If you'd like outside. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          14:32          It's a pleasure. I really appreciate you speaking your truth and in here and mine as well. I really appreciate all of you guys. Okay? Yeah.
