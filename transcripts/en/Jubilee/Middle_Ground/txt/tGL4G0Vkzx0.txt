Speaker 1:          00:00          I don't think that a lot of men realize how scary just they.

Speaker 2:          00:07          Oh,

Speaker 3:          00:21          hi. My name is [inaudible]. I'm from New Jersey originally and I'm a publicist here in way. Hi Guys. I'm Brett and I work in film.

Speaker 1:          00:30          I'm Gabby and I work in film as well. I act. Hi everyone. I'm Cory Aa. I'm from Los Angeles and I'm in advertising and recruiting. My name is far Huda. I'm born and raised in La and I'm a writer and a director. My name is Joe 25 years old and a marketing coordinator here in La. Yeah. Not to say that this is a sound factor that you know, there aren't exceptions, but I think, you know, men are there, they're built differently, there's those stronger. Um, usually I can say, yeah, physically is a one inherent difference.

Speaker 3:          01:17          Obviously it changes based on like their race and gender or like the like where they're from and stuff like that. But I think that women tend to sometimes be a lot more over emotional and where men tend to kind of respond a little bit more stoically and that might not be the most perfect way to say it, but I think of it.

Speaker 1:          01:38          Do you think that's unnatural way that we are, we're born to be or do you think that's how we're brought up?

Speaker 3:          01:45          I think it's a mixture of both. Lexis oil might just be how society has ingrained in them. They should react to certain things to men are supposed to be this like sometimes uncompromising, not unemotional person, whereas the women are supposed to be bullshit. Is that, I think that people sometimes like fall into those categories and even when they're not supposed to be. I feel like even as a man, like you know how I approach a problem is like, oh, how can I fix this thing? Whereas like a lot of my female friends are like, like, I don't need to fix it. I just need to listen to this person. And uh, and like for me, like that's just not my natural impulse. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:23          There's so many men who people will say, Oh yeah, men are always stronger. Always this, always that. Well tell that to a female, UFC fighters will kick their ass. You know what I'm saying? And there are also a lot of options, but there are a lot of people who will say, oh, women are always hyper emotional. And then to lead to a bleeding heart guy who is just like the biggest, most passionate person. I mean, so I just think generalization is always problematic. My husband is, he's one of those guys that cries in like every movie, you know, and like I love that. And I'm like, okay,

Speaker 1:          02:57          very assertive fiery person, which is like generally attributed to masculine and quality, which in itself is problematic that we think like strength is mass scale and problem solving is masculine. We're all capable and we're all also have our weaknesses.

Speaker 4:          03:34          Ooh, we gotta leave.

Speaker 1:          03:39          Definitely. I've experienced a lot of disadvantages. Um, it's been particularly in the workforce, in my position, I'm pretty high up. I kind of sit on the rights, you know, right hand of the president. But it's just kind of interesting how I'm always left with all these like administrative task, you know what I mean? And I'm like, well what about him and him and him and him and him. But it's just, I think it's natural for people to associate administrative work with a, you know, it's a feminine role. Same. Uh, I work at a hardware store and which is, I get looked over all the time cause I'm like, hi, how can I help you? And there go, I'm going to ask this guy like literally just, or not even talk to me. They'll just walk right past me and go ask a man to touch on more like disadvantages, like just having to think, I think to be more conscious of a lot of things like people say like walking to your car at night or going for a jog or just any, anything at night really.

Speaker 2:          04:32          In thinking about it, I was like, well what is the disadvantage of being a man? And I thought back to when I was six, seven, eight, and I was in the school yard and in the classroom and my friends started to police me because the girls weren't getting policed. From what I understand the way that the boys, because the boys were being told, don't be like a girl, don't cry, don't share your emotions, don't show your feelings. Because I wanted to fit in. I embodied those ideas

Speaker 5:          05:04          when I was considering this question, you know, do I have disadvantages based on my gender? Impulsive and just, no. Like as, as a white man who raised in, you know, middle class America, like right off the bat, you have so many, um, like lack of barriers I should say. You have, you have a lack of barriers for opportunity.

Speaker 1:          05:39          Well, I just would like to let everyone know that I do not open my own doors. Don't miss seriously though. So if I'm walking too, if I'm with a male, yeah, if I'm walking to the door, I won't touch the door. Um, however, if I do open a door, if I'm by myself, there's people behind me, I'm keeping it open. And whole family, females, males, no problem at all. But if I'm with a male I will not open the door. You just stand there. Yeah. Look real stupid too. Cause they usually stand there like as a joke and I'm like where does that expectation come from? Yeah. I'm sure it was just the way I was raised

Speaker 5:          06:18          for me as a guy. Like my instinct is like, you know how my dad taught me and my brother is just like, you know, treat women with the utmost respect and honor. I feel like chivalry is just something that I'm like this is absolutely something I want to step into and to continue and uphold. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          06:36          I think that's like a really beautiful way to put it. I also think it's not true. Like that's not born out of like serve because she's up here. It's because we don't, it's, it's the opposite of empowerment. The same reason why a guy doesn't think that you can, you know what? Screw that is is the same reason why they think they have to open the door or why it hurts. Why chivalry can hurt. Cause the, the idea that like we have to protect and we have to like do things for them, it translates I, it's equal to the idea that because they are unable to, generally speaking, I always feel pretty comfortable when I'm with the opposite gender. I am the youngest and I have three brothers and I have a lot of male figures in my life. So I think that that may influence my feelings on that.

Speaker 3:          07:45          I grew up in a family full of women. Literally mom had like three sisters, like all of them have pretty much girls until I was about 13 so 100% feel like I'm comfortable with women being around me. I'm a gay black man. So literally the community just for gay black people or just with gay people in general, you always have like your best girlfriend that's going to be there on your side regardless of whether you just met them or whether you've known them for 25 years.

Speaker 1:          08:12          I don't think that a lot of men realize how scary just they are. And how many men just hanging out, like feel like, oh, that girl could literally kill me. Like that's a true thing. Come from a family that's like has really strong female personalities. You don't doubt that anything that they can do because they went to dependence on the family. They were the ones that raise everybody. They were the strongest people in the family. So I don't, I don't know. I understand you're, yeah, I mean I, I in high school, like I was on the wrestling team, I was one of three girls on the all boy wrestling team and I was like, yeah, this is awesome. Like I'm one of the guys, this is cool. And you know, one of the guys like held a knife to my throat, like behind the bleachers at a game. And you know, you, you want to be able to trust and be like, okay, I don't know you, so I'm going to, you know, give me, give you my trust for a little bit. And then all of a sudden you're on top of me. When, when do I choose? And you're like, who do I choose? And so it's like I've never had that with a woman. So,

Speaker 1:          09:18          ah, I don't think I've always been comfortable and I am a very private person. Um, and so I'm very intentional about the relationships that I build and about the people who I am vulnerable.

Speaker 2:          09:35          I wasn't always comfortable sharing my emotions in check from childhood to, you know, my mid twenties or so. I think it was more of just like dislike. I mean bottle it up, I'll share with a few people, but it wasn't something I would share freely. And I think now where I'm at is I see true power and vulnerability absolutely share and not fear. Um, you know, judgment or shame.

Speaker 3:          10:00          I am strong and the way that I talk and just being strong, people are like, oh, you're angry. You're, you know, you're don't make sense. I'm like, no, I make a lot of sense right now. You know, you're awesome. Just the fact that I have an emotion makes me unreliable in some way. And people's eyes. Like, we can't have a woman running the country. What if she's on her period? We'll go to war. Well, I haven't seen it yet. I am only uncomfortable in how I am perceived because I do want to be perceived as a competent person and somebody who can be trusted. I have taught myself to become emotional, but from my family and from being a black person in America, I don't think that I am comfortable being emotional. I feel like it's like me losing control. It's me being vulnerable and I don't like being vulnerable to anybody unless I choose to.

Speaker 3:          10:55          And I think that bats, it's a sad thing because like I should be able to cry whenever I feel like it, but I don't. Or if I do cry, like I lost a family member last year and broke into tears and work. As soon as I realized that I was crying, I stopped and I said, I have to go home. I apologize. I'm leaving right now. And that's, that's just how I had the respond to it. And I don't think that's healthy, but it's something that I that with, that's just my personal experience when it comes to being a male, a black male in a marriage. Yeah. I'm thinking it kind of goes back to just women being the most approachable people that I can come to and talk about anything when it comes to me or just my experience is a little, like the things I've had to go through. There are a lot more understanding and I don't know, I just feel safe. My experience again with the opposite sex is it's

Speaker 1:          11:54          been pleasant. You know, my entire life I've always felt comfortable. I've always felt understood. I've always felt like I had, uh, uh, a voice, you know, even if it's not again, the voice in the conference room. Um, I always felt like I've always been respected. I think like as a general role, suave, like take looking at it that way. No men don't understand women and it's because we're looking at it as two different things. Like even the idea of being assertive comes off as being a bitch. Are you speaking from a personal place or societal place? Cause I feel like you're, you speak from a very like big place instead of, so it's all the same because the question was like, I not like society. Yeah. Do I feel understood by Matt? Yeah. No, because they don't view me as an equal in this space. Do you feel understood? Um, I feel understood equally by all parties, not, but, but you know, like, I sure,

Speaker 5:          13:06          you know, I believe that we're all, um, image bearers, you know, image bearers of God and like bet were equal. Then we're given these different roles to fulfill. And then when you see, uh, two people dancing and it's a beautiful Cory graft, equal dance, no one's out showing the other person. Um, but when it comes to like, relationships with men and women, like I feel like these different roles can be such a, a beautiful thing when done right, but can also be a disaster if one person is, you know, trying to outperform or other person is taking advantage or overstepping. Okay.

Speaker 1:          13:49          Like you said, there's such a beauty in differences and in masculinity and femininity and it's important to have both in yourself and you a picture. You guys

Speaker 4:          14:17          okay?
