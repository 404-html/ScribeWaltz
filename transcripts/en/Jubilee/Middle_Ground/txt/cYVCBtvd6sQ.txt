Speaker 1:          00:00          I wouldn't dare try. I don't even want the possibility of becoming addicted to something that is going to make me physical dependent upon it. My name is Kayla and I'm a recovery advocate.

Speaker 2:          00:24          Hi, my name is Chris and I'm a cannabis advocate. Hi, my name is Devin and a, I'm fascinated with mental health. My name is [inaudible], but the green goes JC and I am a pro. These things that are grow out of the ground and make us

Speaker 1:          00:40          shift perspective. My name is [inaudible]. Um, I am honestly middle ground.

Speaker 2:          00:47          My name is Kiki Dexter and I'm here pro marijuana

Speaker 1:          00:57          drugs.

Speaker 2:          01:02          So my sister went to rehab for a extensive drug's usage. It affected her life very heavily and was in rehab cost. My parents a lot of time, energy, money, and just emotional draining for the whole family.

Speaker 1:          01:17          My Dad is a very adamantly trying, recovering heroin addict. I think he froze, got addicted when he was like 2021 it was the influx of drugs into the cities in the 80s it still affects his life. I had a physical dependence on prescription anti anxiety medication, Klonopin specifically for like seven years. I went to treatment like three years ago. Um, and eventually found my way back. I would consider myself sober. I've been sober for like two and a half years.

Speaker 2:          01:51          Alcohol played a big role in my life. Marijuana played a big role in my life. I did notice, uh, going into my twenties that the pattern that I do have a propensity to want to get fucked up now. Like I don't smoke, I don't drink or at least that's my intention. But there comes a time when it's like, cool. I think I could go for a nice LSD trip. Woods, that'd be nice.

Speaker 1:          02:16          People often become emotionally dependent on recreational drugs. Yeah, I think they do. Um, for example, I had a great childhood, but I was sexually abused. Nobody knew what was going on. How do you, by the time I was 14, I was using whatever I could get my hands on to, to deal with the emotional turmoil that I was dealing with inside. And, um, when we're so young we have traumatic events or we have these situations and these circumstances that stick with us and we don't know how to process them. So we reach out to whatever's closest to is food addiction, drug addiction.

Speaker 2:          03:07          Um, I think it's, it's good to establish a distinction between recreational use and habitual use cause that's something I heard you guys talking about. And I don't feel that people really become emotionally dependent when they're recreationally using it. When they're habitually using it, when they're using it to solve problems, then it, it, it does become an issue because you're not dealing with balance at that point. I mean you're, you're tipping one way and the scale, you're clearly going to affect other areas and get sick.

Speaker 3:          03:34          Okay.

Speaker 1:          03:35          I believe drugs are safe, moderate

Speaker 3:          03:42          moderation. I don't know what I think actually I agree. I think so. What's up guys?

Speaker 4:          03:55          This was the hard one for me. I just had that hone in on that word moderation. Like if I'm smoking once or twice a week, that's fine. But if I'm smoking every day of my life, every second I get up and I can't function then of, you know, of course that's when there's a red line. I wouldn't say like using things like heroin or cocaine, like he's not a moderation. I think that's just harmful. But if we're talking about the subject of marijuana and that use, then yeah,

Speaker 3:          04:22          yeah.

Speaker 1:          04:22          Well, here's why I disagree. I think there are levels to this. I don't think all drugs are safe, even in moderation. Like you take a wrong Molly or whatever the Percocet pill is like, you know, like people have died from that and that was technically in moderation. One pill, one day, life gone. You know, like, same thing with heroin. Like that's something that could drastically change your life in a day.

Speaker 2:          04:48          The moderation part of it is tough because with pharmaceuticals mainly to me, you mix two those things, you're gone. And that's terrifying.

Speaker 1:          04:57          Yeah. And there are so many circumstances where it only takes one time to become physically dependent. Even in, in my case, um, I take prescription medication for sleeping. I hate that I'm on it and I hate that I have to use it to function. If you don't have to absolutely do it. Why do it?

Speaker 2:          05:16          So let me ask you this though. What's the distinction for you between that and like Iowasca Pod Dmt? Uh, the different, it's not necessary. I think there's a distinction that I I'm going to invite you to look at is like there is a difference between cocaine. Oh it was fine.

Speaker 1:          05:34          Hundred percent but what I'm saying is neither are necessary. My question to you is, are you saying to all the young people like you will not be able to open your mind fully unless you go and do this?

Speaker 2:          05:45          No. What I'm saying is that I hold everybody, hi. And I hold everybody with the ability to think for themselves, but also going out and having an intentional, purposeful, responsible encounter with mushrooms or LSD supported me in getting over my addiction to marijuana and alcohol.

Speaker 1:          06:04          But the point being is the safety issue and what you might have gone in that moment when you took the drawings and it opened her mind and you were able to realize a lot of stuff I think people should do on their own without them

Speaker 3:          06:18          drugs,

Speaker 1:          06:20          drugs, reduce people's potential.

Speaker 3:          06:32          Okay.

Speaker 1:          06:34          I think even with psychedelic drugs, you know, to the point earlier, even if they are opening your mind up, that's really not your potential, that's not your potential. Your potential is the organic potential and a lot of your organic self is wonderful and it is marvelous and if you take a little time to work and develop that muscle, like a talent, then you will be able to reach your fullest potential. When I got sober, I went back to school, which I never thought I would do. I work two jobs, they started a small business, like I think of all of the people who are usually hypersensitive and end up getting into drugs because I can't deal with our emotions and all those people could be potentially adding to society and they're not because they're in their own world.

Speaker 2:          07:20          So I, I really don't feel that they harm people's potential. I think that helped people gain their potential in a lot of different ways. And I mean with cannabis alone, I mean, we have an endocannabinoid system with our body. I mean, it's one of our main receptors. It within our brain that it's like a lock and key for cannabis. It's w are made at the same materials. Our brains synthesizes those materials within it. So I really do feel that our potential isn't high hindered by drugs. I mean, some, it totally, I can see some a hundred percent but overall natural ones, not at all. Some of the most powerful people in the world right now in silicon valley and creating some of the most powerful startups are all microdosing. Oh, totally. Two years ago I did, I had my first mushroom experience. So I went into the woods. I went in nature, I set the intention, I'm going to have this experience and I've never had before. It was a remarkable experience and I felt a deeper truth within my connection to the earth. Something I hadn't had in a long time. And it was kinda this reconnection with my spirituality.

Speaker 1:          08:21          I can relate to you because I also come from a very spiritual background. I think wherever that framework is for you, like if it's a drug, then that's for you. I think that's a dangerous path. I also think that for me, that that thing is God. You know, like me having faith in God and a relationship with God. That is, that is the opening to my spirituality. Like I don't need to take drugs to get there.

Speaker 2:          08:44          Have you done psychedelics? No. So it, it's, it's like someone that hasn't done, had sex talking about,

Speaker 1:          08:51          no, it's not, that's not what it's like at all. Like because how you, the thing is is I don't need to know. That's my point. My point is, my point is you don't need to know to have you do it. Do you have a relationship with Christ and you know, have you spoken in tongues? None of the meaning. That's a cross. That's not a relationship. They're very dope. Right. That is not a relationship. The two are very different. That's my point. So you don't have to ask me what I did not do. What I said was, and I'll repeat it, my experience and my relationship with Christ, for me, that supersedes my desire to even go into that path because I find myself very happy, very successful, buried. I'm thriving within my being and I don't need the stuff

Speaker 3:          09:31          to to,

Speaker 1:          09:33          there is a lot of false information about recreational drugs.

Speaker 3:          09:43          Sorry,

Speaker 4:          09:44          everyone agree? No one knows nothing. It's like based on the culture, the perception, and I'm strictly talking about marijuana, but you know, at one point in history it was also used for medicine. It was, it was used for religion. It was used for, you know, for hip was used for a variety of things like this. And there's people that don't know that it's a part of our history. So when I think about how ill informed people are, that's one of the main things. But the truth,

Speaker 1:          10:13          there's like, do I really want all of the information? I'll be honest. No I don't. I don't, I don't really need it. You don't. I agree with the statement. That's why I walked over because I will agree that like Vr, there's a lot that I don't know about recreational drugs. Um, and I think that there's a lot that most people don't know. Yeah. I mean I walked over for that same thing. I try and keep an open mind at all times and realize that a wise man knows that he knows nothing, especially with cannabis. And now I'm aware and have researched, you know, cannabis oils and taking CBD and myself on. I am interested in as someone who takes pharmaceutical medication as cannabis as an alternative, but my perspective and once again versus recreational versus I would consider that for me medical use,

Speaker 2:          10:56          um, there's a great deal of misinformation. I mean, just like the pharmaceutical, I mean we have all these things that are getting pumped into our homes all the time with all of these side effects and side effects and side effects. More than half the commercial is all side effects, but yet it's telling you it's okay to take that. It's cool to take that. Yeah, it can probably kill you, but it's okay to take that. But you can't take, yeah, take this one and take this one, but don't take this thing over here that can actually help you.

Speaker 4:          11:20          Exactly. I agree with that and I think that's because there are people that benefit from our equity, like us not being literal about the subject.

Speaker 1:          11:30          I have to realize like why, why we're here for this video is pushing information and for recreational drug purposes and like the misinformation. But I think that it takes a lot more education and usually a really bad circumstance for you to want to change around your life and be like, fuck, what am I doing? Like there has to be more than this, but most people never get uncomfortable enough to need to make that. And so I'm, I'm just not going to push it because I just think that it's going to end up way more negative unfortunately. Oh, hey guys, it's Kendra from jubilee media.
