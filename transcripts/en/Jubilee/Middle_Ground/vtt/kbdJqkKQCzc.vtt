1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.590
You my friend,
the first thing you said to me when I sat down was,
oh my God,

2
00:00:04.591 --> 00:00:06.840
you look like somebody I arrested before.
Dude,

3
00:00:06.841 --> 00:00:08.610
I've known you for like two minutes.
I don't even know your name

4
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:27.500
currently or previously have worked in law enforcement against that wall on that

5
00:00:27.501 --> 00:00:28.334
side.

6
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.730
I am nervous about what is going to happen today.

7
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:36.743
<v 1>Okay.</v>

8
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.690
<v 0>Uh,
apparently people are a lot braver than I am.
So,
you know,</v>

9
00:00:47.691 --> 00:00:50.300
are there a lot more comfortable with their stories?
So

10
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.360
I'm just more excited to be here and,
uh,
to share my stories,

11
00:00:59.361 --> 00:01:03.260
to hear everybody else's story for me more.
So it's,
uh,
you know,

12
00:01:03.261 --> 00:01:07.220
in our situations like you're kind of conditioned,
like,
you guys are the enemy,

13
00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.310
you know,
I don't know how you guys feel about us or,
you know,

14
00:01:10.311 --> 00:01:13.370
I've never had a deeper conversation with law enforcement.

15
00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.090
Probably from your point of view is,

16
00:01:15.091 --> 00:01:19.850
is that it doesn't always seem like the justice system is fair.
Uh,

17
00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.770
I think that what you find though,

18
00:01:21.771 --> 00:01:26.771
if it's a few truly love this job and this work that you strive to find that

19
00:01:28.721 --> 00:01:32.090
balance and fairness.
I,
I,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm,

20
00:01:32.091 --> 00:01:36.950
I'm puzzled by what he's saying because I've never heard anything like this

21
00:01:36.951 --> 00:01:40.070
before because I mean,
if it's true,
what you're saying then,

22
00:01:40.071 --> 00:01:42.680
how come police aren't policing police?

23
00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.830
Why are you standing idly by while your fellow officers are going around

24
00:01:47.871 --> 00:01:50.930
shooting and killing unarmed black people?
Why is that happening?

25
00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.000
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

26
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.833
<v 0>Aye.</v>

27
00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.520
I sold drugs.
That's why I did,
I sold a shit ton of drugs and,
um,

28
00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.090
I didn't have family.
I never had,
you know,
I mean,
I grew up in foster homes.

29
00:02:13.091 --> 00:02:15.310
I didn't have any type of family,

30
00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.940
but I fucking knew that when I went to prison,

31
00:02:18.941 --> 00:02:21.820
I knew I didn't want to come back to this shit.
You know what I'm saying?

32
00:02:21.821 --> 00:02:26.500
So while I was in prison,
I knew I needed to start there and build a foundation.

33
00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.110
I've been out of trouble since 1999,
you know,

34
00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.910
so I chose to Kevin my own crimes when I was younger.
I wanted it,

35
00:02:33.911 --> 00:02:38.410
the violence.
I could have easily chose to do something else,

36
00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.040
but I was always there when things were going to happen.

37
00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.340
I was talking about thinking about between my professional life or my personal

38
00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.970
life,
anything illegal man,
we're playing some nights.

39
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.440
I think that like,
you know,
it's,
it's one of those things where like you look at,

40
00:02:55.441 --> 00:03:00.010
for instance,
have I have I killed anybody have robbed anybody,

41
00:03:00.011 --> 00:03:04.720
have I like all these major felonies now I have,
I have,
I sped before.
Yeah,

42
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:05.613
absolutely.

43
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.720
You know what I hear is you're telling me there's levels of legality.

44
00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.300
I mean,
I used to be sort of on that end too.
Like I grew up,
well,

45
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.220
I went to private schools.
I mean,
I'm not somebody,
you know,

46
00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.810
like with stereotype as somebody who gone to prison,
you know,

47
00:03:22.811 --> 00:03:27.040
and then I've gone to prison and I just find out how fucked up the system is.

48
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.180
I mean,
what about the guy who goes out,
has dinner and has a drink,

49
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.410
ends up set spending seven or eight years in prison because somebody started a

50
00:03:35.411 --> 00:03:36.244
fight with them.

51
00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.930
But then I meet people in prison who've shot somebody in the back of the head

52
00:03:40.931 --> 00:03:45.010
execution style and only got 10 years for it,
you know?
Whereas for me,

53
00:03:45.011 --> 00:03:49.870
I spent 13 years in prison because somebody was hurting my family and I thought

54
00:03:49.871 --> 00:03:50.261
like,
okay,

55
00:03:50.261 --> 00:03:55.210
well we're going to go get our stuff back from this person and I get conspiracy

56
00:03:55.211 --> 00:03:58.240
to commit robbery,
conspiracy,
you know,
use a gun,

57
00:03:58.241 --> 00:04:01.960
which has added another 10 years and it's nothing ever happened.
You know,

58
00:04:01.961 --> 00:04:04.990
nobody got hurt and like maybe it's cultural,
maybe it's,
you know,

59
00:04:04.991 --> 00:04:09.370
I grew up where like you defend your family,
you know,
and yeah,

60
00:04:09.371 --> 00:04:11.910
like was it a bad,
a sec.
Sure.
Can I ask a question though?

61
00:04:11.911 --> 00:04:13.780
Like why your first thought wasn't like,

62
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.830
let me call the cops to help solve this issue because you know what?

63
00:04:17.831 --> 00:04:21.790
Like from my experience growing up,
cops don't help.
They just come by,

64
00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.090
show up and make a great show of doing their jobs and then leave.

65
00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:30.040
But I'm just saying there's no consistency in the system.
It makes no sense.

66
00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.430
It depends on which county you go to,
which judge you show up in front of.

67
00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.860
It's a political game.
It's,
that's not justice.

68
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:37.660
What would you consider justice to be?

69
00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.130
I mean I would like to see that there would be some consistency if I go to La

70
00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.060
county or San Diego or wherever,
that the same crimes would carry the same time.

71
00:04:46.061 --> 00:04:50.950
There would be some consideration for you know,
situation.
I don't think there is

72
00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:53.413
justice.

73
00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:01.550
The criminal justice system truly does help to protect societies.

74
00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.660
If we did not have it,
that there would be chaos.
Well,
um,

75
00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:07.710
it may not be perfect right now,

76
00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.580
but we need the justice system and we have to believe it

77
00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.670
for some reason.
It just seems to me that if you are from a low through a family,

78
00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.600
you're easy to get off the hook.
When I was fighting my case,

79
00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:27.020
I had a celly who was fighting the same crime that I committed for an attempted

80
00:05:27.031 --> 00:05:29.010
murder.
He had came back.

81
00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.830
I said that the judge gave him one year with two strikes.

82
00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.570
I don't know how that went about,

83
00:05:33.571 --> 00:05:38.010
but for me I ended up getting 10 years with one strike and his family was

84
00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:42.840
wealthy in that.
Did you have priors?
Did he have priors?
I,
I had no priors.

85
00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:46.530
I just didn't understand why.
Is it that,
you know,

86
00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.730
if your family has more money,
it's easier to get off the hook.

87
00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:55.320
A lot of times I saw that if you have a private attorney,

88
00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:56.640
high power attorney,

89
00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:01.880
I guess you have a better chance of getting off than having public defender.

90
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:06.650
That could be a little,
a little hole in the criminal justice system,

91
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:11.180
but that's how it is right now.
And then I don't know how to address that issue.

92
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:14.600
So I guess that's,
it shouldn't be a game.

93
00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.590
It shouldn't be a game with people's lives.
Like how,
how can I get this when?

94
00:06:18.591 --> 00:06:22.660
How can I negotiate a win with this person's life?
At the end of the day,
man,

95
00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:27.590
it's all about money and it's about numbers and there was no visit this,

96
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:31.330
there's no money in rehabilitation,
man.
There's money in recidivism.

97
00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:32.680
Tell some money,

98
00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:37.480
and I could give up my job today as a result of no other people going to jail,

99
00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.180
which means that they would actually stop committing crimes.

100
00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:41.450
I would do it in a heartbeat,

101
00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:46.610
but there's not too many people like you.
If we had a system,

102
00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:50.470
all them guys like you that awesome.
I think that that's again,

103
00:06:50.471 --> 00:06:54.120
see what you just said is that's the perception that you have is it though it's

104
00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:58.170
a reality for us,
for me,
when I was inside and the nonprofit that I work for,

105
00:06:58.171 --> 00:06:59.820
we had,
you know,

106
00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.050
the programs in there and this is a class that ar is going to help them,

107
00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:05.010
you know,

108
00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:09.060
actually do something with their lives every evening while the guys are going to

109
00:07:09.061 --> 00:07:09.661
class.

110
00:07:09.661 --> 00:07:13.830
Like they get harassed and then we come out of the class and all the cops are

111
00:07:13.831 --> 00:07:17.520
lined up and like get on the wall,
strip search,
tear up textbooks,

112
00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:20.730
tear up their personal property there,
their homework.
Like,
yeah,

113
00:07:20.731 --> 00:07:24.060
that's how the system is.
Like on the way out of prison,

114
00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:28.200
officers were telling me like,
I'll see you back on the next one.
You know,
like,

115
00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:29.430
that's fucking bullshit.

116
00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:35.353
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

117
00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:42.840
<v 0>Out of everybody in the circle.
Um,
that he was the first one to actually voice,</v>

118
00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:45.750
uh,
the fact that he made choices.

119
00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:50.900
It's in that moment that the claim dominion over themselves.

120
00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:52.530
So I appreciate that.

121
00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:53.883
<v 1>Thank you.</v>

122
00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:57.530
<v 0>I don't know how they feel about that.
Um,</v>

123
00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.940
I don't think any one of us right here sat here and say like,

124
00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:05.090
I didn't make my own choices.
I understand.
I made my own choice.

125
00:08:05.091 --> 00:08:08.700
I got myself my own time.
I think I get the sense that you can do to,

126
00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:09.740
without a doubt.

127
00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:14.740
I think the larger issue is that the system is broken and I,

128
00:08:15.021 --> 00:08:16.790
that's what I have a problem with.

129
00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:20.690
I don't have a problem with taking ownership of my actions.

130
00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:24.920
It's society not taking ownership of its own creation.

131
00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:26.770
You don't hear that he was the one,

132
00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:30.500
he was the only person that vocal in saying that.
I will ask you this.

133
00:08:30.501 --> 00:08:33.730
So then I'll challenge you.
Do you know who your representative is to?

134
00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:35.920
Have you ever contacted their office?
No.

135
00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:39.520
Have you ever contacted your Congress member?
No.
Then I suggest that you should.

136
00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:41.140
I mean,
and here's the thing,

137
00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:46.170
because you strike me as a very smart individual that has the ability to go in

138
00:08:47.271 --> 00:08:49.950
influence.
I agree with you as,

139
00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:54.670
I just think that you need to take a walk in our shoes.
You know,
like,

140
00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:59.640
and I don't mean any disrespect by this,
but you sound like an uh,

141
00:08:59.641 --> 00:09:03.100
law enforcement pamphlet.
You know,
like you sound like every perfect thing,

142
00:09:03.101 --> 00:09:04.290
but they want you to say,

143
00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:08.010
it's kind of like when you work in a company and the CEO says this is the
policy,

144
00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:10.080
but when you're on the ground level,

145
00:09:10.081 --> 00:09:13.350
you know that there are certain things that just doesn't work in reality.

146
00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:18.640
I think you have,
you know,
great views and I think you're,
if we had,
you know,
law,

147
00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:22.380
like just a team of law enforcement that is exactly like you to,
you know,

148
00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:25.710
I have the same view.
It's like it would be great,
you know?

149
00:09:25.711 --> 00:09:30.711
But I also think that there is reality when you come out of prison,

150
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:35.730
everything's just so stacked against you.
That's a commonality.
So like when a,

151
00:09:35.731 --> 00:09:37.710
for instance,
when I talk about coming out of the military,

152
00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:41.850
I had people that told me when and where to be,
all these rules and regulations.

153
00:09:41.851 --> 00:09:46.110
And when I got out,
you know,
there was nobody there.
Same thing happens in prison.

154
00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:49.590
You have to break out of the prison mind mentality.

155
00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:54.030
Here's the difference between the mill.
And I agree with you,

156
00:09:54.031 --> 00:09:55.170
there's a lot of similarities.

157
00:09:55.171 --> 00:09:58.170
There are a lot of commonalities with prison in the military.
However,

158
00:09:58.171 --> 00:09:59.370
when you're in the military,

159
00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:02.760
you're told you're the men of this country are the defenders of this country,

160
00:10:02.761 --> 00:10:05.940
your men,
then you'd go to prison.

161
00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:10.290
We were told that were pieces of shit.
We were told that we're animals,
you know?

162
00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:15.060
Um,
and when you've gone through a decade of that,
it,
it gets in your head,

163
00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:18.000
inside your mind.
It's like,
who am I like,

164
00:10:18.001 --> 00:10:19.950
who am I to think that I can do these things?

165
00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:24.140
It just turns you into nothing,
you know,
and,

166
00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:26.400
and makes you believe that you're nothing,
that she can't do it.

167
00:10:26.401 --> 00:10:30.900
And that's something that you can't put into,
you know,
LAPD policy,

168
00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:35.910
you know,
and that's what the justice system does to you.
Like it breaks you.

169
00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:40.230
But you know what?
I can tell you this,
me looking at you,

170
00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:43.890
I don't see any of the things that you,
that you talk about.

171
00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:47.970
I would hope for you and for actually all three of you that you know that you

172
00:10:47.971 --> 00:10:50.970
guys are able to,
to escape those,

173
00:10:50.971 --> 00:10:55.560
those boundaries that had been created.
Because guess what,
at the end of the day,

174
00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:58.320
like you have one life to live and it's going to be predicated upon the

175
00:10:58.321 --> 00:10:59.460
decisions that you make now.

176
00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:05.473
<v 1>Okay.</v>

177
00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:15.460
<v 0>I honestly believe that they have a structure in place that can help the people</v>

178
00:11:21.231 --> 00:11:25.940
who are running it are the ones that need adjusting.

179
00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:29.030
I think it needs a lot of work.

180
00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:34.090
I think the resources are put in to a lot of the wrong places and I'm not okay

181
00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:39.890
with saying,
well this is what we got,
so let's try to work with it.
Like,
no,

182
00:11:39.891 --> 00:11:43.390
I think that there should be moves to try to improve the system.

183
00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:47.570
Like I don't think we should ever be consent,
you know?
Um,
like I say,

184
00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:50.240
unfortunately when the budget crisis happens,

185
00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:55.240
training is the first one that goes out the,
I think they need more training.

186
00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:59.590
If they're training,
say of the one life,
I think it's the work thing.
Awesome.

187
00:11:59.591 --> 00:12:03.460
Think a communication to build a unity in the community.

188
00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:07.560
That way that it can be trusted with one another and be able to,

189
00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:12.670
to work with one another with all the challenges that's going on in this chaotic

190
00:12:12.671 --> 00:12:13.504
world.

191
00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:20.920
No,
no worries

192
00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:26.470
man.
Do you have any information on your nonprofit or actually,

193
00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:31.550
let me give you look at them.
Perfect.
Good luck.

194
00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:34.840
