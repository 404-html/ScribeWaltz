1
00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:01.183
Hmm.

2
00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:12.190
<v 2>I identify as a liberal because I was raised by a super strong feminist mother</v>

3
00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.640
and I believe in equal rights for all human beings.

4
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.420
I hate definition,
I'm a conservative because I voted for Donald Trump.

5
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.110
The liberal policies are more humanistic,

6
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.960
inclusive and less restrictive.

7
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.000
I believe that my conservative values align most with my morals.
Conservative.

8
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.913
<v 1>Gotcha.</v>

9
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:39.563
<v 2>Okay.</v>

10
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:42.733
<v 3>I am nervous.</v>

11
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.060
Think these topics are,

12
00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.030
I think they're really a sensitive to a lot of people and a lot of people feel

13
00:00:55.031 --> 00:00:58.810
very strongly and know a lot of feelings get hurt and you see that in society

14
00:00:58.811 --> 00:01:00.670
and stuff like that,
so that's fine.

15
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.240
<v 2>I'm going to risk because like yeah,</v>

16
00:01:03.241 --> 00:01:05.370
we were forming relationships with like talking,

17
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.930
getting to know each other outside.
Just like now,
is it all gonna Change?
Like

18
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:11.423
<v 3>let's hope not.</v>

19
00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.963
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

20
00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.880
<v 2>I personally think that it's,
you're in my pants,
your civic duty to vote.
Yup.</v>

21
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.710
And I don't see why you can complain if you didn't take the initiative to go out

22
00:01:32.711 --> 00:01:34.330
and let your voice be heard.
And that's what it is.

23
00:01:34.331 --> 00:01:37.270
That people should be going out and making their voices heard and that should be

24
00:01:37.271 --> 00:01:38.410
just general,

25
00:01:38.411 --> 00:01:42.670
like what we do because that's what we are supposed to do as opposed to,

26
00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.730
oh,
I somebody else will take care of it.
Oh,
it's not my problem all,
I don't know

27
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.033
<v 4>is it</v>

28
00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:57.150
<v 3>most of the people I know that didn't vote kind of non voted their conscience</v>

29
00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.210
and yet I think that everyone should still have a say in right to be

30
00:02:04.541 --> 00:02:08.290
participating in,
I wouldn't want to just silence somewhere

31
00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.300
<v 2>then they should be participating.
That's that.</v>

32
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.040
That's the issue is they aren't participants,

33
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.290
but they're not seeing any value in the local elections at all.
Yeah.

34
00:02:15.291 --> 00:02:19.710
There's a lot of things other than
your friends.
Do they go,
look,

35
00:02:19.711 --> 00:02:22.250
I saw no value in any local election at all.
Zero.

36
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.700
Nothing carry about any local action.

37
00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:29.710
Guys do realize a lot of the people being affected by Trump are people who can't

38
00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.130
even vote,
so they're complaining.
I'm like,
go ahead,
complain.

39
00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.690
You've been here since you were six,
five months old.

40
00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.410
You still can't vote or you ever to tell those people and they don't have it,

41
00:02:40.411 --> 00:02:43.510
right.
Yeah,
yeah.
No,
I think those people have a right to complain.
However,

42
00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.690
my beliefs and my thoughts are pointing towards people who are,

43
00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.390
have the ability to have all of the rights and the ability to register,

44
00:02:49.391 --> 00:02:53.630
to vote or to vote.
No.
Yes.
I agree with what you guys have.

45
00:02:53.631 --> 00:02:57.950
Your premise that if you can vote people who cannot vote,
they don't have that.

46
00:02:57.951 --> 00:02:59.890
Right.
That's true.
So that's why I disagree.

47
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.900
<v 3>Uh,
I'm not going to lie.
I didn't vote.</v>

48
00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.160
So all y'all in the comments,
you guys can put it in there now.
Uh Huh.

49
00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.970
I think Donald Trump is doing the best job and became,

50
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.843
<v 1>I think</v>

51
00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.510
<v 3>my personal favorite.
I'm not,</v>

52
00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.870
I don't agree with a lot of the ways he conducted himself in his presidential

53
00:03:32.871 --> 00:03:33.704
campaign,

54
00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.390
but I think if we look at him versus look at him from before he was elected

55
00:03:38.391 --> 00:03:41.490
president and he's a very,
very different person.
Um,

56
00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.120
we're not in world war three,
so

57
00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.560
we used to have the same freedoms.

58
00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:49.500
We can still talk about it and like it's still not liking.

59
00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.380
You can still all these things and I think that you could be doing the worst job

60
00:03:53.381 --> 00:03:55.460
in is doing right now.
It could be much worse.

61
00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:01.980
<v 2>I think he's doing the worst job.</v>

62
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.910
Like when did it be okay for him to be the least common denominator?

63
00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.890
When was it okay for our president?

64
00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.300
Are the leader of this country to be oh well he's was not as bad as he could.

65
00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.670
<v 3>Yeah.
Um,
I'll be honest,
I didn't vote for Donald Trump,</v>

66
00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:19.600
but on January 20th I said,
you know,

67
00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.790
I hope it does the best job just like an Obama did.
I said,

68
00:04:22.791 --> 00:04:23.940
I hope he does because that's,

69
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.740
I have to put my faith in the office of the president regardless of bright,

70
00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.830
bold it,
whoever that is,
they deserve my respect.

71
00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.830
<v 5>The only reason I voted for him or the primary reason was because Ben Carson</v>

72
00:04:32.831 --> 00:04:35.980
came out and supported him.
That's how a conservative would behave,

73
00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.450
is not going to be swearing.

74
00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.030
It's not going to go through a divorce and he's not going to be on the news

75
00:04:40.031 --> 00:04:44.530
saying stupid things that is more conservative person would look like to me

76
00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:49.760
<v 1>like that.
Yes.</v>

77
00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.420
<v 3>I think the people of the opposite party</v>

78
00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:57.120
do not know that.

79
00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.510
<v 5>I just think that people don't,</v>

80
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.560
you get different experiences so you're going to learn differently.

81
00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.380
You're going to see things through different,
through different lenses

82
00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.870
<v 2>and today feel like there's missed information on a lot of the conservative
side.</v>

83
00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:27.900
You guys have info wars,

84
00:05:27.901 --> 00:05:32.850
you guys have things that are blatantly saying sandy hook was fake,

85
00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.680
that the hurricanes are to populate.
Um,

86
00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.720
climate change like there that we have an agenda as in like there is another

87
00:05:42.061 --> 00:05:46.800
reason for us besides saving humanity to try and do something about what we're

88
00:05:46.801 --> 00:05:47.634
causing.

89
00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.810
<v 5>It just comes back to they don't,
what do you believe to be true and why?</v>

90
00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:52.820
I think sometimes,
um,

91
00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.420
when I've had interactions with people that disagree,

92
00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.150
there's so much emotion attached to it and it's hard.

93
00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:05.750
<v 3>Hey everyone,
I'm glad you don't think we're misinformed by appreciate.
Well,</v>

94
00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:08.020
I think if there's drinks,
so like I was listening in,
Jen,

95
00:06:08.021 --> 00:06:10.390
when you were talking about the kind of things that you feel like conservatives

96
00:06:10.391 --> 00:06:12.100
disagree upon her or think about,

97
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.280
I think you were discussing a radical sect of conservatism.

98
00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:19.390
What is promoted is not,
but that is not what most people are relating to.
If you,

99
00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:22.660
if you went out in the,
you're associating yourself with those values so you

100
00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:28.120
there you have the white supremacists were like,
we are a Christian.
You have the,

101
00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:33.010
unfortunately that's not what most people use.
The same thing with,

102
00:06:33.011 --> 00:06:34.600
I mean most of those people are great.

103
00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:38.290
My biggest problem right now is that each party is painted with one broad stroke

104
00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:41.800
of everybody falls under 10 things challenge.

105
00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:45.000
<v 5>At least the reason I didn't come in cause I don't think the other side is</v>

106
00:06:45.001 --> 00:06:49.890
missing,
but I think we're informed differently.
Exactly.
It's interesting.

107
00:06:49.891 --> 00:06:53.640
Social media allows you to interact with people.
They're very,
very different.

108
00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:55.080
You guys friend me on Facebook,

109
00:06:55.081 --> 00:06:57.750
you'll see I'm friends with more people that disagree with me than agree with
me.

110
00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:01.110
I don't care what you believe.
I'm really,
really,

111
00:07:01.111 --> 00:07:04.080
really interested in like eight wise,
like I believe this,

112
00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:07.560
well why I believe this?
Why,
why,
why,
why?
And,
and that's,

113
00:07:07.561 --> 00:07:10.860
that's something that only happens when you develop a friendship or a lot of

114
00:07:10.861 --> 00:07:11.694
interaction.

115
00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:13.623
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

116
00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:20.660
<v 3>To be in the mirror</v>

117
00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:32.470
and to think about that a little bit.
It's like,
you know,

118
00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:36.350
you might love your child but not be happy with how they're acting right now.

119
00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:42.160
And I see things that upset me and embarrass me about how we are and yet our

120
00:07:42.711 --> 00:07:44.120
possibilities,

121
00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:49.870
the way we respond to people all over the world are coming to our values.

122
00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:54.800
I'm still proud,
but not maybe as proud as I used to be.

123
00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:57.020
There's a lot of freedom in what you can say.

124
00:07:57.021 --> 00:07:59.480
And I think there's a lot of power in that because I know a lot of people in

125
00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:02.930
other countries,
um,
if they say anything about the government,

126
00:08:02.931 --> 00:08:06.450
like they'll disappear the next day.
And I get to,
um,

127
00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:08.840
not only voice my opinion,
but also live it,

128
00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:12.230
being able to do whatever you want to do,
make who you want out of yourself.

129
00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:17.520
That's really awesome.
I was surprise my son.

130
00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:25.603
<v 1>I thought the</v>

131
00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:30.510
<v 5>idea of how this was going to be,
that there would be more polar,
it rise.</v>

132
00:08:30.511 --> 00:08:33.220
The more agreement and I see it more centrist.

133
00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:36.190
<v 3>Most people do agree.
Why?</v>

134
00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:40.280
I don't think Trump borders represent all conservatives are all republicans.
No.

135
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:41.810
<v 5>Then there a big population though.</v>

136
00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:42.851
<v 3>I think tonight,</v>

137
00:08:42.851 --> 00:08:45.840
today I was pleasantly surprised everyone because I think that centrist

138
00:08:45.841 --> 00:08:47.350
Messenger may be that I agree with you,

139
00:08:47.351 --> 00:08:49.210
but I also hold my beliefs and I respect that.

140
00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.410
I think that's something that we need the,

141
00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:53.020
it should be happening more and more because I think there's so many

142
00:08:53.021 --> 00:08:55.290
conversations where I keep up with this crazy person talked to,

143
00:08:55.291 --> 00:08:56.124
they think there's no,

144
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:58.050
<v 2>it's we disagree,
but that's okay.</v>

145
00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:05.640
<v 3>I didn't expect to to be super argumentative where you know,</v>

146
00:09:05.641 --> 00:09:08.420
we have to be on civil about things because you know people,

147
00:09:08.421 --> 00:09:10.970
people are going to think differently and if you can think for yourself and

148
00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:12.780
think about the position you're in,

149
00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:15.660
it's very hard to argue with somebody and it's very,
very,
very,

150
00:09:15.661 --> 00:09:19.290
very hard to really dislike somebody just because they believe something else.

151
00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:22.460
<v 2>But I was happy to hear,
uh,
all of us,</v>

152
00:09:22.461 --> 00:09:26.720
it kind of be on the same level really as far as social issues.
Like,
I mean,

153
00:09:26.721 --> 00:09:28.670
as far as being people as opposed to like,

154
00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:32.390
this is my side and this is what I'm right.
You know,
and that's much better.

155
00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:35.550
I was pleasantly surprised.
It's okay,

156
00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:40.840
I'm going to Facebook or anything in it,
right.

157
00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:47.450
Because you see the name,
what's it go wrong?
