1
00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.810
What was once a race thing isn't a race thing anymore.

2
00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:08.020
It's a need for La to be more developed for everyone.

3
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:26.260
I'm Dominique.
I am 27 and I'm a realtor in La.
Uh,

4
00:00:26.261 --> 00:00:27.400
my name is Florida's.

5
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.570
I'm 20 years old and I am a student.

6
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.240
<v 2>I'm Rob,
I'm 27 and I'm a writer.</v>

7
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.610
<v 3>Uh,
my name is Terrance.</v>

8
00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.670
I'm 26 transplant and I work currently for security at Lex.

9
00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.890
<v 0>I'm Dominique,
right?
I'm 32 and uh,</v>

10
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:47.920
I don't know what my employees beside the sea,

11
00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.130
so I can't really tell you about that.

12
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.370
<v 1>Can I get my la logos on the left and my la traffic fines on the right</v>

13
00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.710
the first day?
Yeah.
People have the right to live.

14
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.470
Where are they choose

15
00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.790
<v 2>and like the purest,
most distilled form of that question.
Yeah,</v>

16
00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.830
I would definitely agree that if you are able to live somewhere in you,

17
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.110
you know,
are willing to live there and not just,
you know,

18
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.160
cause I think there's a difference between occupying

19
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.960
<v 3>okay.
And actually being a participant,
Katie,</v>

20
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.820
exactly what to contribute to really live there.
It's probably freedom of speech.

21
00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.010
You can say whatever you want,

22
00:01:36.011 --> 00:01:39.730
but there are negative connotations that could happen from you saying something

23
00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.320
just as if you move somewhere there could possibly be damaging effects even

24
00:01:44.321 --> 00:01:45.910
though you have no ill intent at all.

25
00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.640
Something could happen where you moved in here.

26
00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.550
All your homies and friends moves there and everyone's here now and then the

27
00:01:51.551 --> 00:01:53.860
people were there first.
Can't even go.

28
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.570
<v 0>I think what I perceived in that question was just like your absolute mobility</v>

29
00:02:00.151 --> 00:02:05.151
and moving like where ever you want without like the repercussions of like for

30
00:02:05.941 --> 00:02:10.590
say you're moving into this space that has a lot of history and your presence is

31
00:02:10.591 --> 00:02:11.990
like,
could peep,

32
00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.630
could I possibly oppressive to the preexisting communities?

33
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.400
<v 1>I enjoy returning to the place where I am.
Hello?</v>

34
00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.920
Okay.

35
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.220
<v 0>I wasn't sure because I still live in the place I grew up.
So</v>

36
00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.520
<v 2>my hometown is in Massachusetts,
which is very different from Los Angeles.</v>

37
00:02:34.521 --> 00:02:38.430
And he said,
I miss some of the seasonal things about it for sure.
Yeah.

38
00:02:38.431 --> 00:02:42.520
We don't have seasons here.
You never get,
um,

39
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.950
winters are falls like we do out there.
The town where I grew up,

40
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.010
my parents only live chose that place because the taxes were really high there,

41
00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.420
but it all went to like the good school systems.
When my sister and I left,

42
00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.060
they sold the house and I know it's hard for my sister

43
00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.090
<v 0>because we can't really go back home and that sense I'd say living in Echo Park</v>

44
00:03:08.171 --> 00:03:11.290
my whole life
while I'm living there,

45
00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:15.940
I see it changing right before my eyes.
And it's this like weird,

46
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.530
weird experience where you see the people you grew up with saying,
oh,

47
00:03:20.531 --> 00:03:22.600
I can't afford this rent,
I'm,

48
00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.050
I have to move over like 30 miles away.

49
00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.470
And I think that's one major thing that gentrification does and that's,

50
00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:37.110
it really makes people lose their sense of like belonging and community building

51
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.290
and top route people.
Yeah,

52
00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.570
<v 3>me being nomadic in nature.
I'm a military kid.</v>

53
00:03:47.571 --> 00:03:52.250
I've grown up in so many different places.
It's not where I grew up,

54
00:03:52.251 --> 00:03:53.600
it's who was there.

55
00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.020
Most of the family has moved and most of my friends have moved away from where I

56
00:03:57.021 --> 00:04:01.340
grew up in Michigan.
Also.
I kind of grew up in a very bad neighborhood.

57
00:04:01.341 --> 00:04:06.020
It wasn't the greatest.
The high school I you went to wasn't the greatest.
So,
um,

58
00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.720
it's hard when I go back there and then I'll see those things.

59
00:04:08.721 --> 00:04:10.760
I'm reminded of how I grew up.

60
00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.360
<v 0>I totally hear that.
And um,</v>

61
00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.990
being from central Pennsylvania and I never really feel,

62
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:20.350
felt like I belonged there from when I was very young.
You know,

63
00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.210
I feel like Pennsylvania made me,
but la really made me,
you know,

64
00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.590
like I'm from there,
but I feel like this is where I became who I am.

65
00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.710
<v 4>Things about the city that I love.</v>

66
00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.810
Like I would not want to die anywhere else,

67
00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:39.320
but there is so many things that have changed in the city.

68
00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.310
So just imagine being 30 and seeing people that you grew up with,

69
00:04:43.311 --> 00:04:47.840
not being able to afford a apartment on a street where the rent shouldn't be no

70
00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.400
more than $1,200.
I guess.

71
00:04:49.401 --> 00:04:54.320
I haven't been away for a long period of time to say I miss it just because I'm

72
00:04:54.321 --> 00:04:55.340
just in it.
Every since

73
00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:56.183
<v 1>go</v>

74
00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:03.520
<v 4>is more important than its economic status.</v>

75
00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.910
<v 0>I'm a rock.
What?
Yeah,
I think it is.
I'm journey.</v>

76
00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.740
<v 4>The Almighty dollar has a rice start history and we have to,</v>

77
00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.940
we have to preserve it.
Are we going to just repeat the same

78
00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.500
<v 0>exactly.
We learned from history.
Exactly.</v>

79
00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:27.510
So how are we going to move forward in a society if we don't recognize exactly.

80
00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.770
You know,
you see like a city like Detroit,
right,

81
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.500
where not his city has so much history,

82
00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:43.770
especially with the u s as economy took a city that was so bustling to somewhere

83
00:05:45.761 --> 00:05:49.360
where there are many parts of the cities that I hear like no man's land with,

84
00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:54.550
with reinvigoration I think also comes job opportunities.

85
00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.980
You know,

86
00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:59.750
it keeps the community that like up and moving and bustling.

87
00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:01.520
I you just have to find your space.

88
00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.170
<v 3>I grew up in Michigan,
it's like our family from Detroit.
Like that's real.</v>

89
00:06:04.171 --> 00:06:06.600
Like Motown is like my,
that's my rule.

90
00:06:06.601 --> 00:06:09.720
It's like they still have like museums there that are set up the Fox theater.

91
00:06:09.721 --> 00:06:12.260
Like I still remember going there as a kid.
Like it's,

92
00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.420
it's amazing like being there like in so crazy.
So how would you feel

93
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:16.430
<v 4>they tore it down though?</v>

94
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.340
<v 3>It'd be like someone taking a piece of my heart and just like put it on the</v>

95
00:06:19.341 --> 00:06:20.900
floor.
Like for real,

96
00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.730
<v 4>they're trying to tear down the current sale ma and make it to be like the</v>

97
00:06:24.731 --> 00:06:26.860
growth,
which I think is,

98
00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:30.280
you don't need another terrible idea just because of the people that aren't

99
00:06:30.281 --> 00:06:34.180
living in that,
that area.
They're not going to be able to afford it.

100
00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:37.560
<v 0>Luxury lofts cater to the preexisting community rights.</v>

101
00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:41.360
I have to say I have to disagree.
I actually work a lot in that area.

102
00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:46.390
So I work with people who flipped houses and I think it depends who's who in

103
00:06:46.671 --> 00:06:49.730
that area your speaking to.
Because you know,

104
00:06:49.731 --> 00:06:54.150
I meet a lot of the owners in that area and for them they're loving it.
Yeah.

105
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:58.970
Okay.
Ours
are not and you know,

106
00:06:58.971 --> 00:07:02.840
but also some renters because now it's becoming more walkable.

107
00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.780
What was once a racing isn't a race thing anymore.

108
00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:10.910
It's a need for La to be more developed for,
for everyone.

109
00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:14.590
<v 3>Everyone deserves a place to fall.</v>

110
00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:18.770
<v 1>Uh,
I get the pants.</v>

111
00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:25.350
<v 3>I don't think you need it deserve for sure.</v>

112
00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:29.700
Every child growing up to an adult to serves task,
something called home.

113
00:07:29.701 --> 00:07:31.380
But for me home is here.

114
00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:36.150
It's not like down the block on 31st it's just like where I'm at,
that's home.

115
00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:41.340
<v 0>Some people want to move around or don't mind it or if I actually take something</v>

116
00:07:42.101 --> 00:07:45.940
good from it,
but other people are very comfortable in where they are.

117
00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:49.010
<v 2>I think I can be a state of mind,
a state of being.</v>

118
00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:54.020
I think home absolutely has a feeling more than a location and I think it's

119
00:07:54.531 --> 00:07:59.531
something that evolves to a different stages of life as I have moved from one

120
00:07:59.601 --> 00:08:04.370
and then kind of found one again when I went to college and now I'm just sort of

121
00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:07.860
wondering like I'm realizing I have to build it.
You know?

122
00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:14.400
<v 0>I think that the word deserve is,
is,</v>

123
00:08:14.401 --> 00:08:16.520
is tough because you know,

124
00:08:16.521 --> 00:08:20.990
I think that people deserve what they create for themselves.

125
00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:24.530
There are some people who were just dealt a bad hand,
you know,
and,
and,
and that,

126
00:08:24.531 --> 00:08:29.090
that is not included in this.
If you're not putting in as much work as I am,

127
00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:31.310
why don't you deserve the same thing that I have?

128
00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:35.660
<v 4>Unfortunately a lot of people don't have the same knowledge are the same empathy</v>

129
00:08:35.661 --> 00:08:39.380
you might have.
So not saying it's your job or at your duty,

130
00:08:39.381 --> 00:08:42.590
but sometimes because that person may not have that knowledge,

131
00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:46.700
what you might tell them might be able to beat the spark to change their

132
00:08:46.701 --> 00:08:49.190
mentality so they can go out there and do what you should.

133
00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:52.790
Just what they deserve to have something where you feel like you don't have

134
00:08:52.791 --> 00:08:53.870
anything.
You know,

135
00:08:53.871 --> 00:08:56.330
most of the time you either are going to do something bad or you an archer.
So

136
00:08:56.780 --> 00:09:01.410
<v 0>see some people take that and they use that to become something even bigger and</v>

137
00:09:01.411 --> 00:09:02.790
better and that's,
you know what I mean?

138
00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:05.080
A lot of people don't know how to do that.
I mean,

139
00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:08.310
if someone's parent doesn't teach them those things,

140
00:09:08.311 --> 00:09:11.130
why is it then your responsibility to pick up for the parents?
Yes.

141
00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:12.810
This is more of a moral,
yeah.

142
00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:18.140
<v 3>Well here's my thing.
Like I feel like home looks so different to everybody,</v>

143
00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:22.640
right?
How does someone else having a home really affect mine at all?
Like,

144
00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:24.260
like I'm trying to think about like,

145
00:09:24.261 --> 00:09:26.600
people would just need the basic necessities.

146
00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:29.540
Like I'm not saying every person needs a four floor high rise.

147
00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:34.140
Like I think that it's possible that everyone has some sort of home

148
00:09:34.141 --> 00:09:36.020
instabilities,
some kind of starting point,

149
00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:38.390
and then everyone else can go up from there.

150
00:09:38.391 --> 00:09:42.170
I don't see why there should be an issue about someone's struggling just to live

151
00:09:42.171 --> 00:09:45.980
in their own place.
Like I don't,
I don't,
I'm not making that correlation.

152
00:09:45.981 --> 00:09:46.491
And I don't know,

153
00:09:46.491 --> 00:09:49.970
maybe that's just me and I might not be as diverse in economic and housing

154
00:09:49.971 --> 00:09:50.451
market as you,

155
00:09:50.451 --> 00:09:55.451
but I don't see why every single person should not be able to be inside

156
00:09:55.731 --> 00:09:56.564
somewhere.

157
00:09:56.910 --> 00:10:01.910
<v 4>I think we as a whole have gotten away from empathy and have latched on to</v>

158
00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:05.410
apathy cause it's easy to say,
well I did it so you can do it.

159
00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:05.891
<v 0>No,
but,</v>

160
00:10:05.891 --> 00:10:10.060
and I knew that people do have different situations and they come with different

161
00:10:10.061 --> 00:10:13.360
weights on their shoulders and whatnot.
But I also,

162
00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:17.650
I think that really the issue that everybody's kind of touching on is that

163
00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:19.780
everyone deserves education.

164
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Everyone deserves to know what they can do and how they can arm themselves to,

165
00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:31.060
to be able to,
you know,
be,
have a home and to create more.

166
00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:36.120
I think that it's important for people to take responsibility for the direction

167
00:10:36.611 --> 00:10:40.390
that their life takes.
You know,
once you decide to do that and it stops,

168
00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:45.220
it stops being about what's happening to you.
And instead what you're doing,

169
00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:48.700
you know,
she can change everything for you.

170
00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:54.020
<v 4>We have to be mindful that apathy is roaming the streets right now and it's</v>

171
00:10:54.901 --> 00:10:59.790
ready to kill everybody and we have to get it away from us and make sure that we

172
00:10:59.791 --> 00:11:02.760
put goodness and kindness in our heart and we're able to express that and give

173
00:11:02.761 --> 00:11:03.594
to others.

174
00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:04.813
<v 1>Yes.</v>

175
00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:23.110
