1
00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.420
I don't know like are you not jealous because I don't want to share my partner.

2
00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:14.883
<v 1>Hello</v>

3
00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.710
<v 2>and I have my polyamorous people on the left spotlight and my monogamous and</v>

4
00:00:21.711 --> 00:00:23.160
people on the right spot bite

5
00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.500
walk forward if you agree to stay there.

6
00:00:32.501 --> 00:00:36.950
If you disagree with humans are naturally polyamorous,

7
00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.170
<v 1>we would be the ones.</v>

8
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.330
<v 3>The way I think of myself as polyamorous is even more broad than sexuality.</v>

9
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.770
It's just simply like,
you know,

10
00:00:52.771 --> 00:00:57.771
I can see the beauty in and adore and love qualities of an infinite number of

11
00:00:58.081 --> 00:01:00.820
people.
If I just recognize myself in another person.

12
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.790
<v 0>Yeah,
we don't just love one kid.
We love multiple children.</v>

13
00:01:03.791 --> 00:01:06.790
We don't just love one friend maybe wanting this loved one job.

14
00:01:06.791 --> 00:01:09.190
We're in la how we probably have 12 jobs.
Most of the three of us here,

15
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.390
<v 4>people will have a guide in divorced and remarried and it's like,</v>

16
00:01:12.391 --> 00:01:15.700
oh I'm on my fourth marriage.
You know like how does that work out?

17
00:01:15.701 --> 00:01:18.770
Is like that's really starting to our business.

18
00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.380
That is Kinda like polyamory over time actually.
It's just a circle.

19
00:01:22.381 --> 00:01:26.220
Non Indian when you could've just been true to yourself and have those multiple

20
00:01:26.221 --> 00:01:29.790
relationships,
whether they had a piece of paper or not.

21
00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:35.643
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

22
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.810
<v 4>I understand that a lot of fair marriages fail,
but at the same time,</v>

23
00:01:39.811 --> 00:01:42.570
I feel like a lot of people don't put in the effort that they should.

24
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.960
If people are willing to try and do the best that they can,

25
00:01:45.961 --> 00:01:49.800
then try to be the best for this one person.
It can definitely work.

26
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.330
A lot of people in polyamory wan to use the divorce example as a reason for why

27
00:01:56.461 --> 00:02:00.120
they're polyamorous and they understand,
but at the same time it's,

28
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.220
you can't really know until you try it.

29
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.710
And a lot of people that are monogamous think that polyamory is just all sex.

30
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:08.700
<v 1>No,</v>

31
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.230
<v 0>I've been with the same guy for six years and I've never felt like I needed to</v>

32
00:02:13.231 --> 00:02:16.650
be with someone else and if I did,
I would have just left him.

33
00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.030
As bad as that sounds,

34
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.650
I just can't imagine like feeling equally for two people.

35
00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.670
He's going to have to be equal though.
It doesn't know you see you like,

36
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.820
I mean for lack of better words like rank your partners like wait,

37
00:02:29.821 --> 00:02:31.980
you have a primary partner in most,

38
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.350
even in polyamorous relationships I'm going to open relationship,

39
00:02:34.351 --> 00:02:37.950
not polyamorous,
which isn't about just sex but it isn't.

40
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.940
I do have a primary partner who I live with and who I spend time with you.

41
00:02:40.941 --> 00:02:42.300
I share bills with a nice share,

42
00:02:42.301 --> 00:02:46.110
a family with and then I have other partners maybe who I shared dinner and

43
00:02:46.111 --> 00:02:46.771
drinks were there.

44
00:02:46.771 --> 00:02:50.520
We have a similar career interest and someone will just love making out with,

45
00:02:50.521 --> 00:02:52.350
so I think that there are,
yes,

46
00:02:52.351 --> 00:02:55.470
there's compartmentalize ways and there are people who do have two equal

47
00:02:55.471 --> 00:02:58.680
partners.
I think that's probably the minority versus the majority.

48
00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.760
Just the monogamous relationships.

49
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.320
Nobody's married just the same as what you make it as the boundaries you make.

50
00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:09.130
It's your relationship.
It's not nobody else's relationship.

51
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.280
I got to high five you on that one.
The charge right there.

52
00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:14.263
<v 1>Okay.</v>

53
00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.170
<v 2>I am in love.</v>

54
00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.330
Why did you hesitate before coming?

55
00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.540
<v 3>Because I had to think about how I'm answering that question.</v>

56
00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:36.020
I was thinking about someone outside of myself and it occurred to me that I can

57
00:03:37.921 --> 00:03:40.680
answer this question in a different way and that's been a very big theme in my

58
00:03:40.681 --> 00:03:45.681
life the last few years coming out of a divorce and a monogamous marriage,

59
00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.860
20 years of monogamous relationships and um,

60
00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.420
and the theme of my life for myself right now is finding love with myself and

61
00:03:54.421 --> 00:03:55.860
being in love with myself.

62
00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.610
<v 4>I feel like throughout my relationships I have found a lot of love for myself.</v>

63
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:05.260
Like all of the girls that I had dated and my girlfriend now currently like have

64
00:04:05.261 --> 00:04:06.850
all taught me so many things.

65
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.370
I feel like that's one of the main things and the relationship,

66
00:04:09.371 --> 00:04:13.000
like you love someone so much and then you learn from them and they learn from

67
00:04:13.001 --> 00:04:16.120
you and you guys grow together and it's just like a beautiful thing.

68
00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.190
My name is Alek Tina,

69
00:04:18.191 --> 00:04:22.840
but I go by Alia and honestly as a person I don't think I would be able to give

70
00:04:22.841 --> 00:04:25.270
someone what they want and what they need in that relationship.

71
00:04:25.271 --> 00:04:26.800
If I had more than one partner.

72
00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.560
<v 2>I have been married for two years and um,</v>

73
00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.520
but I've been with my wife for over eight years and she was my only girlfriend.

74
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.640
So it's about as monogamous as against.
Yeah.

75
00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.520
But very much still in love.
Um,
yeah.
I love her more every day.

76
00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.700
<v 0>In a weird way.
My relationship,</v>

77
00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.020
it allowed me to love myself more when I was with someone who totally accepted

78
00:04:51.021 --> 00:04:54.230
all parts of me who was like,
be that it's a beautiful,
it's sexy.

79
00:04:54.231 --> 00:04:56.870
It allowed me to love myself more.
And that's,

80
00:04:56.871 --> 00:04:59.050
I think the beauty of open for me is it,

81
00:04:59.051 --> 00:05:02.600
it's complete acceptance for me and my decisions.
There is no,

82
00:05:02.601 --> 00:05:05.900
well you can't do this or well,
your urges are bad or this is bad about you.

83
00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.340
It's be who you want to be.
Let's talk about it.
Okay.

84
00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:11.650
<v 3>I actually read about,
uh,</v>

85
00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.380
polyamory like when I was in my early twenties I remember being mount like,

86
00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:18.350
this sounds so like it was read something about,
it was resonating with me.

87
00:05:18.351 --> 00:05:21.170
Like I just didn't realize it was that much of an option.

88
00:05:21.171 --> 00:05:24.230
I didn't see much of a model in society.
I thought,
well,
even if I want that,

89
00:05:24.231 --> 00:05:26.840
how would I find someone else who's into the same things I am?

90
00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.780
And in the last couple of years I've been really just saying like,

91
00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:32.450
I need to explore this.
And you define community.

92
00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:35.960
I'm not someone who says I don't believe in monogamy.
As a matter of fact,

93
00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:40.280
having a chance to really explore both sides has given me an understanding,

94
00:05:40.281 --> 00:05:45.120
appreciation for both.
And also understanding the limitations of both.

95
00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.170
<v 2>There is a good reason why most people are monogamous.</v>

96
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.670
<v 0>I don't know.
Like are you not jealous?</v>

97
00:06:01.671 --> 00:06:05.460
Because I feel like that's a main reason why I wouldn't be able to do that as,

98
00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:05.980
I don't know,

99
00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:08.940
<v 4>want to share my partner at all.
Yeah.
I don't share.</v>

100
00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.760
It's like I am with you and you're with me

101
00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:14.190
and you know,

102
00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:18.870
we're together and we're growing and the few don't want me anymore and you want

103
00:06:18.871 --> 00:06:22.950
to go explore.
Are there things?
Go and explore them,
but on your own,

104
00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:24.220
you know,

105
00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:27.310
<v 0>I think that's crazy.
Um,
just because in every other area in our life,</v>

106
00:06:27.311 --> 00:06:28.450
you have to control jealousy.

107
00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:31.830
Jealousy is not a attribute to be proud of to say I'm a jealous person.

108
00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.780
Like if you are at work,
you can't be a jealous person.

109
00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:38.710
Function well at the office you can't function well in your family or with your

110
00:06:38.711 --> 00:06:39.940
friends has a jealous person.

111
00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:42.130
And so why in this one area of your life do you say,

112
00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:45.130
this is where I get to be the person that I can't be anywhere else.

113
00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:48.430
The idea of jealousy of I'm afraid because I've put so much,

114
00:06:48.431 --> 00:06:50.560
it's kind of like the slot machine approach.
I've sat in this machine,

115
00:06:50.561 --> 00:06:53.710
I put in so many quarters I want to get,
reap the benefits,

116
00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:57.850
but if this is someone that you love,
does,
does that extend to that?
If he said,

117
00:06:57.851 --> 00:07:01.660
this is someone that I think might be a better fit,
if my husband said,

118
00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:05.710
I found a different person that I want to be with and she's fulfilling a need

119
00:07:05.711 --> 00:07:10.030
that you don't or can't,
then I'd be like,
okay,
go be happy with her.
Like,
yeah,

120
00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:13.480
it's not natural for me to be like,
okay,
let's the three of us work this out

121
00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:18.640
<v 2>and to me that jealousy is just rooted in the fact that you're completely</v>

122
00:07:18.981 --> 00:07:19.490
intimate,

123
00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:23.780
you've made a commitment to each other and this is the person that is basically

124
00:07:23.781 --> 00:07:24.740
like your second half.

125
00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:29.750
Having that jealousy for your significant other is beautiful and in a way

126
00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:35.390
<v 0>I think monogamy is a practical choice because it's safer sexually.</v>

127
00:07:35.581 --> 00:07:39.930
One,
two,
it's probably a lot simpler and it's,
it's prepackaged.

128
00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:44.010
I mean it's like here's a set of rules that has been created for you hundreds of

129
00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:47.010
years ago.
Here's what love looks like and if that feels comfortable for you,

130
00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:47.780
it's easy.

131
00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:51.960
<v 4>What?
Monogamy is an easy,
you know,
monogamy is hard.</v>

132
00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:56.880
Like being with someone and being with them for 10 15,
50 years is very hard.

133
00:07:56.881 --> 00:08:00.540
You have to find ways to love your partner for truly who they are,

134
00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:04.740
all the good and all the bad and you don't have someone else to turn to when you

135
00:08:04.741 --> 00:08:07.590
want something new.
You have to find that in your relationship.

136
00:08:07.591 --> 00:08:09.450
You have to find a way to spice things up.

137
00:08:09.451 --> 00:08:13.500
You have to find the way of making conversation where you know everything about

138
00:08:13.501 --> 00:08:14.080
each other.

139
00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:17.560
<v 2>Why don't we have one friend?
Why not just one friend?</v>

140
00:08:17.561 --> 00:08:19.480
Why do you need multiple friends at all?

141
00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:24.070
I mean most of us probably have 10 friends,
20 friends,
5,000 Facebook friends.

142
00:08:24.071 --> 00:08:25.860
Why?
Why not just have one Facebook friend?

143
00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:30.450
<v 4>Because you don't build such a strong connection with a friend.</v>

144
00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:33.660
You build a strong connection with a partner because the partner gets to know

145
00:08:33.661 --> 00:08:35.430
everything.
And every single thing will be,

146
00:08:35.431 --> 00:08:37.920
because there's different levels of friendship.

147
00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:40.500
But like when you're in a relationship with someone,

148
00:08:40.501 --> 00:08:43.590
you explore so many more things in so many different facets of your day.

149
00:08:43.591 --> 00:08:46.560
Because at some point you will move in together and you know,

150
00:08:46.561 --> 00:08:50.070
you'll see what everyone does like day to night and you'll get to know

151
00:08:50.071 --> 00:08:52.620
everything about them.
You don't really get that with one friend.

152
00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:56.010
<v 2>I do have like a best friend.
Yeah.
But the reason he's</v>

153
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:58.740
<v 3>my best friend is cause he's different than every other friend I have.</v>

154
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:01.950
And if I have something really,
really serious,
really,
really important,

155
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:04.760
I'm going to him first.
What,
you still have other friends?
Sure.
And I,

156
00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:06.360
and I equate that to uh,

157
00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:10.830
what she was saying earlier about having a primary partner.
For example,
you know,

158
00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:13.980
you could have a primary partner that you have intimacy that you live with,

159
00:09:13.981 --> 00:09:16.680
do you have sex with and you may have like,
let's,

160
00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:18.420
let's equate that to me with your best friend.

161
00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:21.660
And then there could be someone else that you hang out and you play baseball

162
00:09:21.661 --> 00:09:25.230
with,
you do other activities with,
you know,
and I could have another person,

163
00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:28.680
we make music together and we do things and yeah.
When did we have sex?

164
00:09:28.681 --> 00:09:31.500
Once in a while too.
It's interesting that,
you know,

165
00:09:31.501 --> 00:09:32.760
I think from the traditional model,

166
00:09:32.761 --> 00:09:36.570
the fact that I would have any physical connection with this other person is

167
00:09:36.571 --> 00:09:38.780
what distinguishes it as an issue.

168
00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:45.800
<v 5>If my partner wanted me to,
I would consider going to the other side.</v>

169
00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:48.980
<v 1>Oh hell yeah.</v>

170
00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:00.063
<v 3>Um,</v>

171
00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:05.310
I was monogamous for a lot of my life and that was for the reasons that were

172
00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:10.420
felt authentic to me at the time.
And I've been nonmonogamous for some time now,

173
00:10:10.421 --> 00:10:12.220
which has been authentic for me for this time.

174
00:10:12.221 --> 00:10:17.221
And I think that for me the important thing is always keeping an open mind and

175
00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:21.370
realizing that life is constantly evolving.

176
00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:24.800
<v 0>I think one of the things I disliked about monogamy or when I was in a</v>

177
00:10:24.801 --> 00:10:27.470
monogamous relationship is all of the you need to,

178
00:10:27.471 --> 00:10:31.320
or you should or that we have a prearranged agreement of what loving charter

179
00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:33.530
means.
And if you don't obey that it's over.

180
00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:36.650
And I wanted to give my partner a true open experience.

181
00:10:36.651 --> 00:10:39.110
And so if I'm going to say to you,
it can't be monogamous,

182
00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:42.140
well how is it really open?
Because there is a condition on there of like,

183
00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:44.030
well this is the only way this is going to work.

184
00:10:44.031 --> 00:10:47.390
So it's always open to me means open for discussion.

185
00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:58.770
<v 4>Can I jump in?
And what you said about like loving and you know,</v>

186
00:10:58.771 --> 00:10:59.880
fully accepting someone.

187
00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:04.260
I just know that I as a person wouldn't be able to be in the polyamorous

188
00:11:04.261 --> 00:11:09.120
relationship and keep myself happy.
So if my partner were to suggest,

189
00:11:09.121 --> 00:11:09.960
I would say,
you know,

190
00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:14.340
I don't think I'm capable of doing that and I would still love them.

191
00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:16.620
I would support them.
I would want to be friends with them.

192
00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:18.930
I would want them to be as happy as they can be,

193
00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:21.480
even if it doesn't involve me in their life.

194
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.810
<v 0>I think what the strength that non-monogamy has over monogamy is that we're</v>

195
00:11:25.811 --> 00:11:27.820
saying,
who are you?
Who am I?

196
00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:31.180
Let's figure out something that makes sense for us versus this is what I was

197
00:11:31.181 --> 00:11:34.750
told love is let's try and do that thing.
I don't feel like I live that way

198
00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:36.100
<v 4>because someone told me to.</v>

199
00:11:36.101 --> 00:11:40.270
I just don't have the want to add other people.

200
00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:44.000
<v 3>Well,
until you don't have that desire,
it's authentic to you.
Yeah,</v>

201
00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:49.140
and I think that so many people on this earth have the desire and they think

202
00:11:50.021 --> 00:11:51.340
they don't have the option.

203
00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:55.210
<v 0>My name is jasmine.
I actually married my very first boyfriend.</v>

204
00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:59.530
We just steal loped and we got married about two years ago and we've been

205
00:11:59.531 --> 00:12:00.730
together ever since.

206
00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:06.050
<v 2>A good sex life is necessary for a good relationship.</v>

207
00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:07.983
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

208
00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:23.490
<v 4>If sucks dies from the relationship and your love and lust for each other kind</v>

209
00:12:23.491 --> 00:12:25.020
of dies,
um,

210
00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:28.770
then you might be better off as friends and partners as friends.

211
00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:34.310
<v 0>Sex is so much more than just physical that it makes a big impact in how I feel</v>

212
00:12:35.451 --> 00:12:39.140
in my relationship.
If I don't have sex,
I'm going to feel like disconnected.

213
00:12:39.141 --> 00:12:42.720
Like there's something off in a relationship.
Ultimately.

214
00:12:42.721 --> 00:12:45.110
You mean I talk about sex,
we're living,
it's a big part of my life.

215
00:12:45.111 --> 00:12:47.960
It's a big part of my reset if I'm not have sex with you and do it myself.

216
00:12:47.961 --> 00:12:49.280
Like I really enjoy it.

217
00:12:49.281 --> 00:12:52.880
Orgasm has ridiculous amounts of health benefits and it just feels great.

218
00:12:52.881 --> 00:12:55.670
So I love the physicality of it.

219
00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:59.690
But I also think that every person should like really define what are the top

220
00:12:59.691 --> 00:13:03.020
five things you have to have in a relationship.
And for a lot of people,

221
00:13:03.021 --> 00:13:06.260
sex doesn't hit that top five.
And if it doesn't,
that's okay.

222
00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:09.470
You can still make a relationship work and that's sex being a priority.

223
00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:11.870
But if you're someone like myself,
you can't,

224
00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:13.820
<v 3>I'm in the same boat with you.</v>

225
00:13:13.821 --> 00:13:17.600
Like I've always been a very like sexually driven person.

226
00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:20.750
I'm an explorative person.
Um,
and,

227
00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:23.630
and all pretty much all the monogamous relationships I was in,

228
00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:26.750
I never found someone that,
let's say matched my kink.

229
00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:31.430
So having a partner that's like really on the same page with me as explorative

230
00:13:31.431 --> 00:13:36.431
and open as I am is really like fruity much at like the top one or two things

231
00:13:36.891 --> 00:13:38.840
that I would say in a relationship for me.

232
00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:44.720
<v 2>Sexist in everything in life,</v>

233
00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:45.903
<v 0>Huh?</v>

234
00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:50.080
<v 4>If the sexual tension is,
they're awesome.
But what happens after the section,</v>

235
00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:54.310
the sexual tensions is gone.
Like was that it was just sex,

236
00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:58.270
the sexual tension dies out.
It is kind of a can,

237
00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:01.540
but that's the whole point of like where people have to rekindle it and they

238
00:14:01.541 --> 00:14:06.520
have to try new things and they have to see what works to make the spark come up

239
00:14:06.521 --> 00:14:06.881
again.

240
00:14:06.881 --> 00:14:10.780
Because after he spent so much time with someone and you know them so well it

241
00:14:10.781 --> 00:14:11.471
can get lost.

242
00:14:11.471 --> 00:14:16.471
But it's a continuous effort of trying to make your sex life the best it can be.

243
00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:20.070
<v 3>Even in a non monogamous relationship,
you still have to do that.</v>

244
00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.400
Like I don't think it's healthy to like just go run out and look for things.

245
00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:27.240
Other things,
just because my primary relationship is like not working.

246
00:14:27.241 --> 00:14:30.720
Like it's still neat.
You know,
that that relationship still needs work.

247
00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:31.950
Every relationship needs work

248
00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:35.380
<v 2>well.
I think,
uh,
like sex is important.
I mean,</v>

249
00:14:35.381 --> 00:14:40.381
I can just think of all the things that sometimes like sex can just cure and

250
00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:44.610
relationship.
Um,
and I don't know what it's like to,
you know,

251
00:14:44.611 --> 00:14:47.530
have a terrible sex life.
So I guess take this with a grant.

252
00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:51.980
<v 0>But you know,
I don't think,
I think</v>

253
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:55.370
<v 2>about the amount of time you spend with your,
your partner,
right?</v>

254
00:14:55.520 --> 00:15:00.050
Compare that to the amount of time you have sex with them.
I think a lot,

255
00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:04.460
a lot more happens besides sex and a relationship is,

256
00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:07.730
I mean it's like how much fun you have.
Like the intimacy,

257
00:15:07.731 --> 00:15:10.460
you shared conversations,
everything.
Right.

258
00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:14.560
<v 3>You know,
making sex,
not just about sex,
it's about connecting to so someone,</v>

259
00:15:14.561 --> 00:15:16.420
right.
So I think it would feel like it's a space,

260
00:15:16.421 --> 00:15:21.421
it's a really amazing space to like to explore that connection in the closest

261
00:15:21.521 --> 00:15:23.020
physical way you possibly can.

262
00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:26.650
<v 4>I feel like if sex was your first like priority,</v>

263
00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:28.720
you wouldn't really be in relationships.

264
00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:32.980
You would be finding sexual partners that fit you,

265
00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:35.430
but you wouldn't really care about anything else.

266
00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:39.850
I feel like sex plays a big role,
but also we're,
you know,
we're puzzles,

267
00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:43.090
like we have so many pieces and we have so many needs and so many things that we

268
00:15:43.091 --> 00:15:46.960
want to fulfill,
but sex I think is pretty important for most people.

269
00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:51.830
<v 2>I've been attracted to other people while in a relationship.</v>

270
00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:52.713
<v 1>Shit.</v>

271
00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:05.330
<v 0>Oh,
well,
good for you.
Oh,
okay.</v>

272
00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:13.170
I feel like I found people pretty nothing to a point where I would even consider

273
00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:17.070
acting on it.
I don't think you can only be attracted to one person.

274
00:16:17.071 --> 00:16:18.780
I feel like that's really unrealistic.

275
00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:23.010
I think it's crazy thing to deny that because I mean I think of every species

276
00:16:23.011 --> 00:16:25.440
exist in says survival and procreation.

277
00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:29.520
So to think that you to shut off that entire part of yourself,
not you just,

278
00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:32.250
I think action is one thing because people have successfully done that.

279
00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:35.850
But in terms of feeling or seeing some muscles attractive,
that's crazy.

280
00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:40.800
Apparently there is one person that can say this conversation the question a

281
00:16:40.801 --> 00:16:43.670
different way.
I just,
I can't wrap my head around.

282
00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:46.680
<v 3>It's totally possible that we can all be wired a little bit differently.</v>

283
00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:50.860
Like we're all on a different point in the scale and I think our life experience

284
00:16:50.861 --> 00:16:54.280
also shapes us to a degree as to where on that scale we are.

285
00:16:58.810 --> 00:16:59.770
<v 0>Tell us,
tell us.</v>

286
00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:05.680
<v 2>No.
So I know I'm going to sound crazy and I know it's like,</v>

287
00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:10.740
it's something that I always have disagreements with with my friends and um,

288
00:17:11.350 --> 00:17:15.730
I think it is a little bit of what you said,
you know,
being wired differently.
Um,

289
00:17:15.850 --> 00:17:20.410
in the beginning when I first started dating my wife,
that was Giddy,
Giddy,

290
00:17:20.411 --> 00:17:20.991
like in,

291
00:17:20.991 --> 00:17:25.960
in love that like there was just this giant bubble around a relationship.
Uh,

292
00:17:25.961 --> 00:17:30.010
but then as we,
as we matured and our relationship,
we got married,
what,

293
00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:33.970
what I felt uncomfortable with is looking at other women.

294
00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:35.950
Like it actually made me feel uncomfortable.

295
00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:39.220
So the same way that I train myself to like,

296
00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:42.400
if you want to call it suppress or whatever,
uh,
other,

297
00:17:42.401 --> 00:17:45.790
other feelings and impulses I have,
I do the same here.

298
00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:49.170
So whenever I see a girl like,
yeah,

299
00:17:49.171 --> 00:17:52.620
I'm going to walk down the street and I'll turn my head or whatever and there'll

300
00:17:52.621 --> 00:17:56.280
be a girl wearing almost nothing or whatever.
My,

301
00:17:56.580 --> 00:18:01.520
what I've like built in is literally an instinct to just look away and not to

302
00:18:01.521 --> 00:18:03.270
think any further.
Uh,

303
00:18:03.271 --> 00:18:07.830
what I think what's weird to me is like the conversations I'll have with other

304
00:18:07.831 --> 00:18:11.370
people where they'll,
they'll look at,
um,
someone of the opposite sex,

305
00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:14.040
find them attractive and keep going.

306
00:18:14.041 --> 00:18:16.950
And like mentally they're having sex with like all these weird things.

307
00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:20.340
And that's like,
I'm really uncomfortable for me.

308
00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:21.900
<v 0>You're not saying like,
oh,</v>

309
00:18:21.901 --> 00:18:25.800
I was born only thinking this one person is attractive.
Right.

310
00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:28.710
You're saying you train yourself to be that way?
Pretty much.
Okay.

311
00:18:28.711 --> 00:18:29.840
That makes a lot more sense to me.

312
00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:30.793
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

313
00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:35.280
<v 2>I would feel incomplete without my partner</v>

314
00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:45.843
<v 1>really.</v>

315
00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:51.380
<v 0>Honestly,
if I ever never met my partner,
I wouldn't be that person.</v>

316
00:18:51.381 --> 00:18:54.980
I am today in the past year of dating my girlfriend,

317
00:18:55.010 --> 00:19:00.010
I have become so different and I've learned so many things and they have started

318
00:19:00.021 --> 00:19:03.950
taking care of myself so much more than that was a year before I met her and

319
00:19:03.951 --> 00:19:08.270
they feel like that has so much to do with her and how she helped me navigate

320
00:19:08.271 --> 00:19:09.020
this.

321
00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:14.020
I had a really unsafe home life and me and my husband got to know each other in

322
00:19:14.391 --> 00:19:18.950
the sixth grades were 12 I moved out when I was 18 me and him like we had

323
00:19:18.951 --> 00:19:21.290
nothing.
We somehow made her way over to La.

324
00:19:21.291 --> 00:19:24.500
Like I honestly don't think I'd be here.
Like if the wasn't for him.

325
00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:26.823
<v 1>Disagree,
not again.</v>

326
00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:32.400
<v 3>Oh Man.
I was married for some time.</v>

327
00:19:32.401 --> 00:19:34.200
So my whole journey,

328
00:19:34.201 --> 00:19:38.790
the last two and a half years has been to feel complete by myself.

329
00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:43.470
And um,
there are times like I really do desire partnership.

330
00:19:43.471 --> 00:19:45.630
I do desire a primary partnership,

331
00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:48.690
but I really think it's so important to,

332
00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:51.630
to be okay just being as I am.

333
00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:55.760
<v 0>When the words incomplete,
I'm like,
no,
I don't connect with that.
I connect with,</v>

334
00:19:55.761 --> 00:20:00.230
I'd feel sad and feel hurt.
Um,
I would feel disadvantaged maybe even,

335
00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:04.190
but I'm still going to be me and I totally understand that we're coming from

336
00:20:04.191 --> 00:20:06.770
different places and how we developed our relationship.

337
00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:11.930
My idea of a relationship is one plus one equals three one complete person plus

338
00:20:11.931 --> 00:20:15.380
one complete person equals a completely separate third is going to do this one

339
00:20:15.381 --> 00:20:18.500
but completely separate third relationship.

340
00:20:18.501 --> 00:20:21.020
And this would be incomplete if of course if we laughed,

341
00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:24.410
but the ones would still stand still and be strong.

342
00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:28.620

thank you so much.</v>
