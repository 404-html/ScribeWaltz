1
00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:01.650
Just flag a lot of people out here.

2
00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:06.300
Just get him degrees by luck or by cheating your way through if that was the

3
00:00:06.301 --> 00:00:08.250
case in college is so accessible.

4
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:11.520
I just feel like we'll have a lot of one of these.

5
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.133
<v 1>Okay.</v>

6
00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.850
<v 0>Come on.
College grads on that side.
And why dropouts on the other side?</v>

7
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.200
First statement,

8
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.880
I feared how I would be judged if I didn't go to college.

9
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.900
Just me and then that's cool.

10
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.900
It was the fear of me,
people with thought,
um,

11
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.240
as far as like my peers.

12
00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.840
But then when you start bringing your parents into it and it's like that's a

13
00:00:59.841 --> 00:01:03.960
greater fear.
It's like you live with your parents.
It's like,
you know,

14
00:01:03.961 --> 00:01:05.000
you want to make them proud.

15
00:01:05.001 --> 00:01:08.840
So I just fear this closure between me and my parents,
you know?

16
00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.460
Yeah I am Shawn Fitzpatrick.
I went to Columbia,

17
00:01:13.461 --> 00:01:17.210
Chicago for not even a semester and I was like,
no,
you know what,

18
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.210
let's go back to California and do music.

19
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.040
I went because they wanted me to go and then,
and then I said,

20
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.970
if you want me to make you proud,
uh,
let me do this.

21
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.930
Non Agree or it's come on in.

22
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.720
<v 2>I wasn't afraid that I would be judged if I didn't go to college,</v>

23
00:01:35.721 --> 00:01:38.180
but I also didn't question going to college.

24
00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.710
It was just kind of the next step and I didn't plan otherwise.

25
00:01:42.711 --> 00:01:46.490
So that's what that path of growth,
it seemed like it was the next step.
Yeah.

26
00:01:46.491 --> 00:01:48.720
And you're encouraged by your parents and

27
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.050
<v 0>they gave me that pathway of saying,
you know,</v>

28
00:01:51.051 --> 00:01:54.800
the only way you're going to succeed is through college.
But then as I got older,

29
00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.260
they gave me the idea,
well,
you can do whatever you want.

30
00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.470
If you find your path though,
you need to find your path.
But if you count,

31
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.390
you should go to college.
At the end of the day,

32
00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.200
I believe college should be free.

33
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:10.663
<v 1>I'm broke.</v>

34
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.790
<v 2>I had an instate,</v>

35
00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.260
like all of my tuition was paid for and I still have debt now I'm sitting on it

36
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.090
and I don't have a job.
Not like a real job.
I,
the dad definitely racks up.

37
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.080
It's ridiculous.

38
00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.761
<v 0>That's true.</v>

39
00:02:25.761 --> 00:02:28.880
But that that becomes an investment in the future at the end of the day.

40
00:02:28.881 --> 00:02:29.870
So you have to take that on

41
00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.220
<v 2>education.</v>

42
00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.020
But does your like was actually one degree or a higher paying job?

43
00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.780
Not In my experience it's necessary.

44
00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.740
I didn't even question going to college until after I had finished.
It was like,

45
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.430
what do I do now and why did I even go?
And you know,

46
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.110
<v 0>if everyone went to college it would become useless</v>

47
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.620
just for like a lot of people out here just get them degrees by luck or getting

48
00:03:07.661 --> 00:03:09.430
degrees by cheating your way through.

49
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.640
And if that was the case in college is so accessible,

50
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.670
I just feel like we'll have a lot of wannabes and that people were really

51
00:03:17.801 --> 00:03:19.010
passionate about,
you know,

52
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.290
what they want to do or dedicating sweat bones and tears into what they're
doing.

53
00:03:23.291 --> 00:03:25.330
So the world would,

54
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.620
I don't think we'll be a better place if everyone was just a degree.

55
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.690
Okay.
Converted at seems very my cause if,
yeah,

56
00:03:34.691 --> 00:03:38.500
I guess then you don't think of it in our college.
You're just doing it.

57
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.890
You just think about labor workers,
like people that just do manual labor.

58
00:03:41.891 --> 00:03:45.670
You don't need a degree to do some manual labor work.
So if you have everyone,

59
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.540
you know,
sticking their heads in a book,
we won't have stuff being built.

60
00:03:49.541 --> 00:03:53.170
Your House won't be billed yard,
your cars won't be fixed.
You're all changed.

61
00:03:53.171 --> 00:03:55.210
You know what I'm saying?
Like you have to realize that in life,

62
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.900
especially in the world,
it's a balance of,
yeah.
Fifth people,
like

63
00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:05.600
I come from a minority,
underrepresented,
uh,
disenfranchised.

64
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:09.830
And in my college experience,
I,
the higher I got,

65
00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.350
the less people that look like me that I saw.

66
00:04:12.351 --> 00:04:16.490
So the more people that look like me in college would make me so happy.

67
00:04:16.491 --> 00:04:17.570
That's what I'm saying.
So like,

68
00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.380
it's tremendous to see more people going to college,

69
00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.070
but you have to realize that this is,
if yes,

70
00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.720
what are people don't want to,

71
00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.140
<v 2>oh no,
no,
no.
But if more people did,</v>

72
00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:32.023
then it would be a good thing.

73
00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.860
<v 0>That's right.
I just think that college education,
if everyone had it,</v>

74
00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:38.000
I don't think it would make the degree itself useless.
Yeah,

75
00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:43.410
I think that's the one part.
Oh No,
I'm,
I think we were taking off a pedestal,

76
00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.180
not making it meaningless.

77
00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.470
<v 1>Okay.</v>

78
00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.180
<v 0>I know what I want to do with my life.</v>

79
00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:59.563
Yes.

80
00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.350
<v 3>Um,
I'm still figuring it out,
but I'm,
I'm,
I'm in it right now,
so I feel like,</v>

81
00:05:04.351 --> 00:05:04.831
I know,

82
00:05:04.831 --> 00:05:08.340
but there's so much more that's getting revealed as soon as I find out I'm,

83
00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.550
I'm currently getting a degree in psychotherapy,
however,

84
00:05:11.551 --> 00:05:14.310
I still need two or three more years to get all my hours.

85
00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:19.670
And so I'm debating whether or not even to get my license and just be on a woman

86
00:05:19.831 --> 00:05:22.260
empowerment coach.
And other than getting it done with Grad School,

87
00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.920
I can fully invested my,
all of myself into it.
So

88
00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.040
<v 0>yeah,
it took a minute.
I mean,
yeah,</v>

89
00:05:29.041 --> 00:05:34.041
it was not an easy journey and it was a lot of investing and finding out that I

90
00:05:34.861 --> 00:05:37.650
was investing in the wrong things.
So,
you know,

91
00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:40.130
<v 2>I like how you changed your mind.</v>

92
00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.680
<v 0>Bought a hot house like we,
I really don't know.</v>

93
00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:48.090
<v 2>Do I?
I want to say that I'm,
I don't feel lost.
Like,
I don't feel like,
oh,</v>

94
00:05:48.091 --> 00:05:50.230
I don't want to do,
I don't know what I want to do with my life.

95
00:05:50.231 --> 00:05:55.231
I'm actively pursuing a lot of goals right now and I don't anticipate like one

96
00:05:55.241 --> 00:05:57.730
goal last time.
You like time.
Exactly.
You Go,

97
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.070
<v 0>I know all the things that I want to do.</v>

98
00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:04.550
I'm just not sure which one is the like for you guys it's like this is it.

99
00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.370
For me.
I was like,
I'm,
I'm dibble and dabble in some different things.

100
00:06:07.371 --> 00:06:10.340
I'm just like,
anything could be the final goal.

101
00:06:10.341 --> 00:06:11.410
I just don't know which one it is.

102
00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:15.140
I want to perfect every craft that was going to school for architecture.

103
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:20.250
And I was,
uh,
three years in and then I got into acting and I both,

104
00:06:20.251 --> 00:06:24.290
the job when I realized,
I was like,
Whoa,
I really like doing this.

105
00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:28.530
So dropped out of school and I decided that I'd pursue acting instead.

106
00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:33.080
But that came later on after I did three years of college and I did four.

107
00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:37.270
I have three classes before I graduated.
I just like,

108
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:42.080
I decided to leave because I felt the time for me to pursue the things I wanted

109
00:06:42.081 --> 00:06:44.810
to do.
My life was now in college was holding me back from that.

110
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:46.620
<v 1>Okay.</v>

111
00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:48.930
<v 0>Education is the key to success.</v>

112
00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.450
So when I heard education,
um,
you know,

113
00:07:00.451 --> 00:07:03.340
I didn't necessarily associated with college.
Yeah.

114
00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:06.750
I just associated with gathering all the tools and the data and the knowledge

115
00:07:06.751 --> 00:07:11.270
and,
and then embodying that into whatever field you want to be successful.

116
00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:14.760
And the success too.
It doesn't just come with luck.
You know,
you have to,

117
00:07:14.761 --> 00:07:17.250
you have to work harder when you want to do.
And what success

118
00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:23.430
I took,
education has like a college degree.
When you presented that question,

119
00:07:23.431 --> 00:07:25.920
I thought that's why I didn't even walk up because,

120
00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:29.070
and we got to realize like we learn daily.

121
00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.830
Like every day we're learning something and it's so funny.

122
00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:34.320
There's no book in front of us to learn those things.
I will learn.

123
00:07:34.321 --> 00:07:38.610
It just so happened that we crossed the right person or someone related that

124
00:07:38.611 --> 00:07:41.400
information to us or you know,
just based off life experiences.

125
00:07:41.401 --> 00:07:44.700
So I don't think that you're going to be successful based on the fact that you

126
00:07:44.701 --> 00:07:49.701
went to school or you're know you're opening up a book or something daily.

127
00:07:49.771 --> 00:07:51.900
It's a learning experience.
Every time you wake up in the morning,

128
00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:54.180
you should be learning something new.
At the end of the day.

129
00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:57.300
That's how I feel about life.
So we're actually more so on the same page,

130
00:07:57.690 --> 00:07:58.470
different parts of it.

131
00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:03.470
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

132
00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:06.103
<v 0>that's a wrap guys.</v>
