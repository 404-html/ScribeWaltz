1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.240
Yeah,

2
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.240
I have an obsession basically with power and money is power and you don't have a

3
00:00:06.451 --> 00:00:09.360
platform without that and then it calls us when he wants to commit suicide.

4
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.230
<v 1>Now you're going to get worn out.
I'll tell you.
That's a dangerous sir.</v>

5
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.513
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

6
00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:29.583
<v 1>Okay.</v>

7
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.890
<v 2>The wall with the x one,
it can,</v>

8
00:00:37.891 --> 00:00:41.260
I have all of my high income folks and on the other side,

9
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.863
<v 1>yeah.</v>

10
00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.870
<v 2>I think the opposite side judges me to the side that I stand on it.</v>

11
00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:08.653
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

12
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.470
<v 3>there is.
There is judgment.</v>

13
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.130
Society seems to think that it's based on mental conditions,

14
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.200
alcohol abuse or drug abuse that we're in the streets where most of the times

15
00:01:24.201 --> 00:01:25.034
it's not.

16
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.030
<v 5>I do feel judged by the other side because I feel like most people have an</v>

17
00:01:31.131 --> 00:01:36.131
innate massive in or insecurity within themselves as they start as human beings.

18
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.970
So jealousy is a natural tendency mass majority of people have.

19
00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.770
Sure.
And that's the root of why they're not successful to begin with.

20
00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.640
I don't think jealousy is natural.

21
00:01:47.641 --> 00:01:51.470
All I think we were all born exactly the same and to say it's inherited I think

22
00:01:51.471 --> 00:01:56.030
is a bunch of bs.
It's all learned behavior and I'm telling you,

23
00:01:56.031 --> 00:01:59.300
if we took these people on that side and they were trained to have different

24
00:01:59.301 --> 00:02:01.430
beliefs and judgments,
they'd be a wealthy as hell.

25
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.320
Every human being incredible from the start.
That's a beautiful sight.

26
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.883
Disagrees.

27
00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:11.450
<v 4>I Dunno.</v>

28
00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.510
I guess I don't really spend that much time around people who are on the other

29
00:02:14.511 --> 00:02:18.050
side,
so I don't feel like I didn't know what they actually think about me.

30
00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.570
There's enough open minded people that do really well.

31
00:02:20.571 --> 00:02:23.750
There was very kind and so I don't feel like the other site judgment.
Yeah,

32
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.720
<v 2>I would spend a day on the other side.</v>

33
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.670
<v 0>I sort of started on the other aisle.
I grew up sort of low income neighborhoods,</v>

34
00:02:34.671 --> 00:02:35.540
broken homes,

35
00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.470
but for me that was something that kind of gave me that drive to want to achieve

36
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.400
and to me I would say that that's been something that's been very helpful to me.

37
00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.263
So yeah,

38
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.620
<v 4>I just like to see what it's like to be on the other side.
For once I would say,</v>

39
00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.110
yeah,
I would like to learn from them.

40
00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.780
I would help my mother,
but it depends on whether we're doing,

41
00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.700
if it's illegal or if it's something my conscience that will step back.

42
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:01.810
I don't know how they got their money.

43
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.070
<v 5>Yeah,
you don't.
Once you update and financial security,</v>

44
00:03:06.071 --> 00:03:08.350
whatever that means to you as individuals,

45
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.980
you realize it's all for nothing.

46
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.520
It says it in the Bible ever live.
I live in Hebrew.

47
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.830
It means it's all for nothing.

48
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.630
The reality of why we do all we do is because we're looking to feel fulfilled

49
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.280
and that's why I have no problem going back because fulfillment doesn't come

50
00:03:27.281 --> 00:03:28.114
from money.

51
00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.030
<v 4>I was scared to admit how much money I made.</v>

52
00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:37.783
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

53
00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.140
<v 4>A lot of times have you speak how much money you make.</v>

54
00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.090
That's a great way to get sued and let people know you have something to get it.

55
00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.800
So sometimes it's better off to not let people know what you got.

56
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.113
<v 1>Okay.</v>

57
00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.460
<v 4>I cut the realization that wait a minute,</v>

58
00:03:57.461 --> 00:03:59.800
I'm supposed to work so hard in life to get a job.
Two,

59
00:03:59.801 --> 00:04:02.380
married a woman who wouldn't marry me if I didn't have that job.

60
00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.970
So that's why I look at a lot of my pharmacist friends,
[inaudible] friends.

61
00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.090
Uh,
they boast this and that,
but I asked him a question,

62
00:04:10.091 --> 00:04:12.670
if you didn't have that money in that job,
would she still be with you?

63
00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.210
She wouldn't.
So,
so,
um,

64
00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.480
I'm never afraid to tell you what,
how much?
100%.
Yeah.

65
00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.820
If someone really loves you,
it was always enough.

66
00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:24.920
If someone doesn't know will never be enough.

67
00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.300
And so I'm not just tell people how much I make my whole life and that also weed

68
00:04:30.301 --> 00:04:31.730
out all the people I want.
No part of.

69
00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.910
Most of my friends were true friends are the best time we ever have or like

70
00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.670
simple conversation like this money is,

71
00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.840
<v 5>do you feel like money is power?
Yeah.
And I've seen it and what way</v>

72
00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.530
in the illegal ways
I've seen it too.

73
00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:54.570
It does,
it works.

74
00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.180
<v 0>It is manifested power.</v>

75
00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.110
Is there a higher power or is there a higher spiritual level?
Certainly,

76
00:05:02.111 --> 00:05:04.990
but in the level that we operate in,
um,
yeah,

77
00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:06.910
I mean if you want to get something done,

78
00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.810
you need some sort of financial backing.
You know,
generally speaking,

79
00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.730
<v 5>money is energy.
It's,
that's all it is,
right?</v>

80
00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.250
So on form it is power.

81
00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:20.450
It's power to be used in a good way about what the views and a bad way.

82
00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:24.950
Money will only amplify who you are as a person.
To a larger extent,

83
00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.140
you're a Douche bag.
You're going to be a big a douchebag.

84
00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:30.910
<v 0>You're a sweetheart of a person giving you again,</v>

85
00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.220
<v 5>become more of a giving human beings.
That's all that money is going to do.</v>

86
00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.320
<v 4>Might be a good idea to go talk to Gandhi.</v>

87
00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:39.750
<v 0>Yeah,
you want</v>

88
00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:40.980
<v 4>to talk to mother Theresa.</v>

89
00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.490
The thing about power is you speak something and it occurs.

90
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.220
Do you speak something and does it happen?

91
00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:49.680
And if you've gotten money or if you don't have money,

92
00:05:49.681 --> 00:05:51.300
it's basically the bottom line is this,

93
00:05:51.301 --> 00:05:55.320
what is my purpose in life and am I boom having it happen.

94
00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.250
All you gotta do is look at somebody's life,
can look at people's Auras.

95
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.800
All of us haven't certain worry.
It's real obvious.
Sure.

96
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.800
And you know whether you're making a difference in that you can't fool him.

97
00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.930
<v 0>I am satisfied with how much money I have right now.</v>

98
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.290
<v 5>Once you attain financial security.
And I said this earlier,</v>

99
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:19.580
it's just access for me.
I'm a 31.

100
00:06:19.581 --> 00:06:23.360
I probably mentioned financial security when I was like 2110 years ago.

101
00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.490
Self made no daddy,
no mommy,
nobody.

102
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:31.490
And I was very fortunate to recognize what success means.

103
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:36.440
That responsibility of success and also what I want out of life.

104
00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:38.990
Money doesn't motivate me anymore.

105
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:43.550
I didn't come here today to show off that I have money.

106
00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:49.240
I came here because hopefully I learned something that I didn't know yesterday

107
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:54.830
and that I also could hope maybe influence someone that didn't know something

108
00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:55.753
the same

109
00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:00.810
<v 4>being wealthy is having no once.
Yeah,</v>

110
00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:02.730
I think I've got just about everything I need.
I'm,

111
00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:05.390
I'm telling you to have a lot more.
Don't need it.

112
00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:09.670
<v 0>Well,
yeah,
for me it will never be enough.
Um,
you know,</v>

113
00:07:09.671 --> 00:07:14.671
I have an obsession basically with power and money is power and you don't have a

114
00:07:15.881 --> 00:07:18.970
platform without that.
So if you want to provide a positive message,

115
00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:21.180
you need that power.
And without money you can't.

116
00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:24.220
<v 5>But that's not going to solve you and Nate problem of wanting more.</v>

117
00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:27.760
<v 0>Now it's not.
And I,
and I accept it at the door and then it's like</v>

118
00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:29.710
<v 5>you can say it about drugs.</v>

119
00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:34.510
One of the line you can sit about woman that you want another girl you can say

120
00:07:34.511 --> 00:07:38.290
about anything that you have in a,
uh,
an obsession for abundance of,
right.

121
00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:42.490
You're right.
So that's the,
not the problem,
but that's the,

122
00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:45.370
the way the money borrowed is just the,

123
00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:49.570
<v 0>but that's okay.
I don't need,
I don't need to be okay.
I just need,</v>

124
00:07:49.571 --> 00:07:51.640
I need to be successful.
I need to make things happen.

125
00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:57.450
<v 5>Do that.
If you really feel that,
I'm not going to stop you obviously,
but I,</v>

126
00:07:57.451 --> 00:08:00.080
all I can tell you is my opinion,
and I can tell you this much,

127
00:08:00.081 --> 00:08:04.940
is that it will never be enough.
And the feeling you have will never go away.

128
00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:08.660
And anxiety,
we'll bring you in your life will never make you happy.

129
00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.880
<v 4>And then he calls us when he wants to commit suicide.</v>

130
00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:15.610
<v 0>That's six you're going to get,
you're going to get worn out.</v>

131
00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.030
I'll tell you that's a dangerous sir.

132
00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:21.130
But I do think though that people that get stuck in that totally over material

133
00:08:21.131 --> 00:08:24.970
perspective,
that there was something missing inside and you might not see it,

134
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.210
that there might be a very big elaborate show and shiny things and beautiful

135
00:08:28.211 --> 00:08:31.750
women.
But I think somebody that has immature behavior patterns like that,

136
00:08:31.751 --> 00:08:34.690
I think it speaks to,
you know,
and an inner vacancy

137
00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:37.630
<v 4>I would say.
Awesome.
Um,</v>

138
00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:41.090
I just feel like I haven't reached,
um,

139
00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:46.310
or I want to be,
uh,
financially happiness wise.

140
00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:50.300
I'm not sure what I want to do all the time and

141
00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:54.910
<v 5>no,
I was there.
I'm sure he was the,
anybody was there.
Yeah.</v>

142
00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:58.830
Well you don't know where you're going.
I understand why I'm at where I'm at,

143
00:08:58.831 --> 00:09:03.660
but I know he knows exactly what it is.
I know I'm sick,
I'm sick,

144
00:09:03.661 --> 00:09:07.260
I'm sick.
He's on a,
on a mishit.
It does a beautiful thick,

145
00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:11.880
that level of energy,
dedication,
focus.
Yeah.

146
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:16.230
That will attain mass loads of anything he puts his effort to.

147
00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:19.410
<v 4>I'm grateful where the</v>

148
00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:26.310
I am because every day I have been able to get up in the morning,
I'm alive.

149
00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:31.200
There's certain situations,
rapes,
shootings,

150
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:36.930
everything out there that you know has occurred to me,

151
00:09:36.931 --> 00:09:41.400
to other people and I'm blessed and I'm great to be alive because we don't know

152
00:09:41.401 --> 00:09:44.850
when our time is going to be up.
That's hundred percent true.

153
00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:49.830
Puts it in perspective right there.
I mean I think about where it came from,

154
00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:53.420
things I take for granted now that I'd never would have imagined that a younger

155
00:09:53.421 --> 00:09:56.300
age and but like you said,
the core blessing is to be alive.

156
00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:00.660
<v 5>A lot of people wake up with,
what am I going to eat?
Yeah,
what am I going to go?</v>

157
00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:04.500
What's this person going to try to do to me?
It's a fucked up,

158
00:10:04.501 --> 00:10:06.410
excuse my French instead of mine.

159
00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:10.410
So I'm extremely grateful that I'm on the giving side of things that I have the

160
00:10:10.411 --> 00:10:13.620
ability to share and not take necessarily.

161
00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:17.690
<v 4>I have true friends and that I live a very,
very simple life.</v>

162
00:10:17.691 --> 00:10:21.420
And anyone who goes to my life and wants to stay in my life are very simple and

163
00:10:21.421 --> 00:10:22.560
very loving at the same time.

164
00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:26.580
I have nothing really to complain about besides the fact that I want to do more.

165
00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:27.270
Um,

166
00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:31.740
but even that is like a blessing yourself cause I have the opportunity to try it

167
00:10:31.741 --> 00:10:32.640
and do those things

168
00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:34.780
<v 5>filling because of America.
But it's the best</v>

169
00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:38.501
<v 4>the end of your life.</v>

170
00:10:38.501 --> 00:10:41.370
Are you a much more loving personally at the beginning of your life or you've

171
00:10:41.371 --> 00:10:45.120
been at the end of this discussion?
I feel so.
I feel I've grown a lot and Laura,

172
00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:46.870
she kind a privilege speaking with everyone.

173
00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:50.620
We're here for the of the most important thing is love.

174
00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:53.680
How much do you love at the end of your life compare to the beginning of your

175
00:10:53.681 --> 00:10:57.950
life?
I think that's very true.
That's a,
that's the last question.

176
00:10:58.940 --> 00:10:59.840
