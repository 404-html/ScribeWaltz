1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.030
Your penis has not been socialized and it doesn't know how to add

2
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.730
<v 2>in the left hand light.
Can I have my sex workers,
my right hand light,</v>

3
00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:28.870
my religious leaders.

4
00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:33.663
<v 1>Okay.</v>

5
00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.700
<v 2>I will say a statement if it is true for you,
walk forward.</v>

6
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.570
If it's not true,
do not step forward.
Stay where you are.

7
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.500
Sex work can have positive effects.

8
00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.780
<v 0>Yeah.
Does sex work and have a positive effect?
Are you serious?
Like in a,</v>

9
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.680
in a society where we're not having conversations about sex,

10
00:00:57.681 --> 00:01:02.681
like of course people are leaning on someone that can guide them and like that

11
00:01:03.051 --> 00:01:06.620
means porn.
That means like that means sex workers.

12
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.400
So many customers come into the club and they're just like,

13
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.070
they just want to talk sometimes.
I remember that.
Yeah.

14
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.720
They want to talk about sex with someone and connect with someone and talk about

15
00:01:17.721 --> 00:01:19.070
their sex life being like,

16
00:01:19.071 --> 00:01:23.660
yeah and be like open about it and like explore maybe like the things that they

17
00:01:23.661 --> 00:01:26.120
can explore with someone else.

18
00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.210
A lot of people do look up to us and lean on us for assurance or some kind of

19
00:01:31.671 --> 00:01:34.760
something to hold on to because maybe they are that lonely in life that they

20
00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:36.680
don't have interactions with people.

21
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.370
I literally have a fan that emails me every single holiday and I was like,

22
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:40.851
oh my God,

23
00:01:40.851 --> 00:01:45.020
this guy is actually someone that's a little bit like emotionally or physically

24
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.620
underdeveloped.
That's amazing that sex work,

25
00:01:48.621 --> 00:01:52.430
my sex work gives him something to look forward to and that's what's sad is

26
00:01:52.431 --> 00:01:55.310
people don't think of people like that that are on the outskirts of society.

27
00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.430
They also love sex and they want that interaction as well.

28
00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.400
Even with like it within marriages like you need to learn different techniques.

29
00:02:01.401 --> 00:02:03.710
You need to learn like how to role play.
You need to like,

30
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.700
that's why marriages fail because you are not happy,

31
00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.550
you're not having sex.
Like sex is a great way to connect.

32
00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.353
<v 1>Okay.</v>

33
00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.660
<v 2>In my own personal experience with porn,
it just tweaks my chemistry man.</v>

34
00:02:18.661 --> 00:02:21.390
Like to where I'll be walking down the street and see someone and be like,

35
00:02:21.391 --> 00:02:22.830
why is that girl taking her shirt off?

36
00:02:22.831 --> 00:02:27.030
Like that's supposed to be what happens now?
Because I'm missing sex education.

37
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.100
Yeah.
Well I don't think so.

38
00:02:29.101 --> 00:02:34.101
For me it's that my mind gets used to a simplicity of it all.

39
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.840
And for me,
sex is available.
I'm married,

40
00:02:36.841 --> 00:02:39.550
I'm married to a great woman that's willing to,

41
00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.210
to party and so like it's not for heart and draw.

42
00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.780
Is she a party with them?
Um,

43
00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.380
and so,
so for me it's not how I got to figure out how to get this.
Like it's,

44
00:02:52.381 --> 00:02:56.500
it's there and that's the only place it's ever been for me.
Yeah.
I don't know.

45
00:02:56.501 --> 00:03:00.430
Maybe it's,
it's like I'm drinking is totally fine for some people,

46
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.280
not an alcoholic.
Maybe I'm the alcoholic with porn.
That just,

47
00:03:03.281 --> 00:03:07.780
it tweaks my mind in a negative way that it makes me go,
man.
I,

48
00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.100
I don't want to be thinking about these people I'm encountering like that.

49
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.750
I just want to be able to look at them as humans and instead of like thinking

50
00:03:16.751 --> 00:03:21.010
about people and how they couldn't provide for me.
So I feel,
I feel like

51
00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.700
<v 0>that the extreme frustration is the demonization of porn without actually</v>

52
00:03:25.701 --> 00:03:30.500
offering an actual alternative that kids or adults have of any kind can look

53
00:03:30.501 --> 00:03:32.660
towards first real sexual education.

54
00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.040
You can sit here and talk all kinds of massive outpouring and say that it's bad

55
00:03:37.041 --> 00:03:40.740
and it's damaging.
But what is actually,
um,
enriching?
There's nothing.

56
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.913
<v 1>Yes.</v>

57
00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.530
<v 2>Any sexual behavior is okay with consent.</v>

58
00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.193
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

59
00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.040
<v 2>And let's go ahead and like get out of the way.</v>

60
00:03:56.041 --> 00:03:57.910
Like we're not talking about children,

61
00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.840
I'm talking about people that can not have consent or animals because they

62
00:04:00.841 --> 00:04:01.800
cannot give consent.

63
00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.040
I have some people that want to do some of the nastiest freakiest things and I'm

64
00:04:05.041 --> 00:04:08.790
not into it.
But being a sex worker,
like I love being able to do that for them.

65
00:04:08.791 --> 00:04:09.201
You know,

66
00:04:09.201 --> 00:04:13.560
like I like to be put in those situations where I'm now like the one that might

67
00:04:13.561 --> 00:04:18.561
be uncomfortable and have to figure out why I'm feeling this way and how I can

68
00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.880
come out doing a good job.
I will say,
I'm interested to see you sitting up here.

69
00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.280
Why am I up here?
Why are you happy?

70
00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.860
I want to walk up because I've counseled couples that are like married for a

71
00:04:31.861 --> 00:04:36.390
long time and sex is a problem.
Like a huge problem.

72
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.920
I do this like inventory sheet,
like oral sex.
Yes,
yes.
No,
no.
And write in it.

73
00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.400
And whenever we would go to the,
but play like the guy is like,
no.

74
00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:49.410
Yeah,
I was like,
why?
Cause it's like I'm not,
you know,
whatever.
I'm just like,

75
00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:50.850
Nah.

76
00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.160
I mean guys can't even take their own partners sometimes just being like,

77
00:04:56.161 --> 00:05:00.360
I want us.
Yes.
Mess with your job.
Hello.
My standard of sex.

78
00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.260
Um,
I feel like I've surrendered to God,

79
00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.770
to my understanding of God and the Scriptures as best as I understand them.

80
00:05:07.771 --> 00:05:12.600
And so for me,
if there was consensual,
like you said,

81
00:05:12.601 --> 00:05:13.830
if there's 12 people,

82
00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.450
like that's not okay for the standard of life that I have.
Like I said,

83
00:05:18.451 --> 00:05:21.690
I'm going to live by this standard of holiness and righteousness.

84
00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.010
That's not a judgment on anyone else.
That's me saying that sex,

85
00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.090
even if it was consensual,

86
00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.970
I don't think it would be okay if somebody came to my church and said,
hey,

87
00:05:29.971 --> 00:05:34.230
we want to start swinging,
I would say that it's going to destroy marriages man.

88
00:05:34.231 --> 00:05:36.600
And that's it.
High ethic and my church,
no.

89
00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.970
<v 0>Do you have any Antione example of that?
Destroying marriages?
Yeah,</v>

90
00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:44.770
<v 2>I actually had isn't it counsel people through divorce from affairs?</v>

91
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.550
Is it because of their like religious shame like that they're holding on to

92
00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.190
maybe you'd have to ask them specifically.
I don't remember it being shamed,

93
00:05:53.191 --> 00:05:57.710
but um,
adultery,
adultery and affairs is lying.

94
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.910
That's not sad.
That's bad.
That's non-consenting.
That's cheating.
Yeah.

95
00:06:01.911 --> 00:06:05.660
Cause the other person that's being lied to is not consenting to the third party

96
00:06:05.661 --> 00:06:08.990
being a part of that relationship.
That's,
that's cool.

97
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.960
The standard that we,
that I come at it from.

98
00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.030
And you guys can say that you disagree with the standard,

99
00:06:14.031 --> 00:06:17.090
but when the standard is that I believe God says this,

100
00:06:17.091 --> 00:06:20.300
sex is for this couple,
this married couple,

101
00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:23.780
then when we step outside of that,
we can,
we can go,
well,
what about this?

102
00:06:23.781 --> 00:06:28.140
What about people that aren't married not deserve sex?
You know what?
No.

103
00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.810
According to the Bible,
it's a gift from God.
So now,
um,
that question,
but again,

104
00:06:32.811 --> 00:06:36.620
marriage and the Bible isn't quite literally white people are desperate to get

105
00:06:36.621 --> 00:06:40.760
married and rushing to marriages and getting to bad marriages because they feel

106
00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:44.510
that sex is only sanctified through marriage or whatever okayed and they are

107
00:06:44.511 --> 00:06:48.590
married to whoever and they have whatever kind of sex or they get cheated on.

108
00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:53.750
That's a really sad scenario.
Like I'm not for everybody,

109
00:06:53.751 --> 00:06:55.420
but certain people,
you know,

110
00:06:55.730 --> 00:07:00.730
my hopes is that we finally start living as a nation and don't put Christian

111
00:07:01.011 --> 00:07:05.990
values above human values.
Are we like honestly,
as a human,
as a society,

112
00:07:05.991 --> 00:07:09.110
not philosophically.
Like it doesn't have to be a new religion,

113
00:07:09.111 --> 00:07:14.111
but just philosophically shift our mentality forward from this old book.

114
00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:19.670
<v 3>There's a lot of assumptions happening right now.
Um,</v>

115
00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:24.730
I resonate so much with this idea of why are we going off of this book?

116
00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:28.100
Heck yeah,
I'm right there with you.
Sometimes I read stuff and I'm like,

117
00:07:28.101 --> 00:07:31.190
holy Moly,
I need to execute that passage.

118
00:07:31.191 --> 00:07:34.610
I need to understand what that means because if I'm going to teach on this,

119
00:07:34.611 --> 00:07:36.320
I better know what the heck I'm talking about.

120
00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.530
If they don't understand the culture at the time of the audience that was being

121
00:07:39.531 --> 00:07:40.850
spoken to her written too,

122
00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:45.110
then it can be taken out of context and so there's a lot of study that goes into

123
00:07:45.111 --> 00:07:46.010
it.
But with that,

124
00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:49.520
the statements that you're making just in the past couple of minutes or really

125
00:07:49.521 --> 00:07:54.200
blanket statements of let's just throw out this entire thing because it's

126
00:07:54.201 --> 00:07:58.310
devaluing my work or it's coming against and though I would agree,

127
00:07:58.311 --> 00:08:00.590
if you look at it at face value,
100%

128
00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:04.060
<v 2>romantic connections make sex better.</v>

129
00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:07.013
<v 1>Personally.</v>

130
00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:15.000
Some of the best sex I had is like,
I don't know who.

131
00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:17.983
<v 2>Okay.</v>

132
00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:20.740
<v 3>I'm so surprised by you too.</v>

133
00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:27.440
Romantic connection.
Make sex better.
Yeah.
That feels very

134
00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:32.340
<v 2>a universal.
Sure.
Yeah.
Absolutely.</v>

135
00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:37.140
I love having a discussion on sex about sex with people that maybe have had not

136
00:08:37.141 --> 00:08:37.321
even,

137
00:08:37.321 --> 00:08:42.270
maybe tons more sex than me cause I've only ever had sex with one person.

138
00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:47.130
Like that's it.
And we,
we've gotten like good at each other,

139
00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:51.140
but that's it.
Wesley,
hang in there bud.

140
00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:56.760
Hang in there man.
Damn.
What's being said right now,
mom?
I think it's beautiful.

141
00:08:56.761 --> 00:09:01.340
And so there has been in my marriage,
um,
transactional sex,

142
00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:05.120
just like,
hey man,
I,
I need to,
I need to have some love right now.

143
00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:06.440
And then there's been like,

144
00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:10.610
we go away for the weekend and there's notes and there's gifts and,

145
00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:15.020
and it's better in that context for me.
So I'm my wife's first,

146
00:09:15.021 --> 00:09:19.410
but I've had a lot of partners and I just,
I dunno,

147
00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:24.290
it just hasn't been a satisfying compared to having it in the context of my

148
00:09:24.291 --> 00:09:24.830
marriage.

149
00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:29.240
Sex is better because it's in the context of like this person that won't leave

150
00:09:29.241 --> 00:09:30.990
me I see is as loyal,

151
00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:35.010
she's committed and we get to do this thing called sex first thing that came to

152
00:09:35.011 --> 00:09:39.090
my mind and now it makes sense why you don't want to watch porn because you've

153
00:09:39.091 --> 00:09:40.770
only had sex with the one person.

154
00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:44.640
So like of course you don't want to watch it because the penis has a mind of its

155
00:09:44.641 --> 00:09:48.100
own.
I want no one word you.
You Watch for it and then you'd look at

156
00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:56.320
your penis has not been socialized like a dog or a child.

157
00:09:57.490 --> 00:10:00.720
I will say I dig it and it doesn't know how to handle that.

158
00:10:00.721 --> 00:10:05.721
You have done that because that is a whole nother level of commitment that I'm

159
00:10:06.811 --> 00:10:09.180
never willing to go down.
You know,

160
00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:13.800
I have had sex with partners where I've lake have literally looked into their

161
00:10:13.801 --> 00:10:17.850
eyes and have like felt like that,
that thing that is talked about,

162
00:10:17.851 --> 00:10:21.770
like that connection,
that bonding of like the souls.

163
00:10:21.771 --> 00:10:23.940
I have cried even while you know having sex.

164
00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:27.720
But to say that it has to be romantic for it to be better,

165
00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:29.460
I think is being overzealous.

166
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:33.780
I would prohibit my child from doing sex work.

167
00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:38.023
<v 1>Okay.</v>

168
00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:42.580
<v 3>As an adult child.
As an adult,
yes.
W W sorry,</v>

169
00:10:42.581 --> 00:10:44.190
can use another word besides prohibit.

170
00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:48.540
<v 2>I would not be okay with my child doing sex work.</v>

171
00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:49.443
<v 1>Okay.</v>

172
00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:51.763
<v 2>Oh God.</v>

173
00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:59.690
My mind was doing the same thing.
Yours was prohibit.
What?
Like,
what's that mean?

174
00:10:59.691 --> 00:11:04.010
Disowned nola wouldn't disown.
Not Love them.
Absolutely not.

175
00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:08.270
Um,
all I would do is just say it's,
it's not what I would want you to go.

176
00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:09.770
That's not what I would want you to do.

177
00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:15.190
It'd be hard for me because of my own view of sex as being a sacred thing and in

178
00:11:15.501 --> 00:11:19.010
my own personal world,
not wanting to be a show for others.

179
00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:23.230
<v 3>When two people have sex,
there's a soul tie that is created.
Our bodies are,</v>

180
00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:27.350
you know,
emotional,
spiritual,
physical and so is sex.
You know,
it's,
I,

181
00:11:27.351 --> 00:11:28.570
I give people this example.

182
00:11:28.571 --> 00:11:32.080
It's like if you take two pieces of wood and you glue them together and then you

183
00:11:32.081 --> 00:11:35.530
try to pull them apart,
will they come apart?
Yeah.
If you're strong enough,

184
00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:36.393
they'll come apart,

185
00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:39.990
but they're still going to be glue or pieces of wood on both sides.
And that's,

186
00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:43.210
that's what I would explain or kind of define as a soul tie.

187
00:11:43.211 --> 00:11:46.480
There's always a piece of that person with them and that is,
uh,

188
00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:50.830
that is outside of religion.
That is just a belief that I see in the,

189
00:11:50.831 --> 00:11:54.100
in humanity.
To me,

190
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.150
<v 0>my heart would be sad for my child.
Um,</v>

191
00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:00.320
<v 2>I would be burdened.
My heart would be burdened for them.</v>

192
00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:08.630
I think the reason why there is so much fear with someone going into the sex

193
00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:09.553
industry,

194
00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:14.600
are they going to get mixed in with the wrong crowd?
Is there going to be drugs?

195
00:12:14.601 --> 00:12:15.590
It's a lot of fear of base.

196
00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:18.800
And my parents told me all the time that I'm changing people's views in that

197
00:12:18.801 --> 00:12:23.801
small town in Texas because now they can see someone who does sex work and as a

198
00:12:24.201 --> 00:12:29.201
porn star and is a family man and this loving and spiritual and yeah,

199
00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:32.390
it makes sense to me why you wouldn't want that.

200
00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:35.690
And I would love some dental too because sex work is real work,
dammit.

201
00:12:35.691 --> 00:12:38.490
And I need to be compensated fairly.

202
00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.700
Do you think you want to go down on everybody?
Yeah,

203
00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:49.100
<v 0>that is a job that is a job.</v>

204
00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:53.270
So like obviously we come from a context where we were like,

205
00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:57.490
we think of like that dark like payments just speeding up like their hose and

206
00:12:57.491 --> 00:12:59.570
things like that.
Just the drugs.
The sex.
Right.

207
00:12:59.571 --> 00:13:01.580
Like to the best of your knowledge,

208
00:13:01.581 --> 00:13:04.820
like what percent of the sex industry is that?

209
00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:07.900
<v 2>I think we have to then ask the same question,</v>

210
00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:12.670
what percentage of your industry is not truly living their truth and their life

211
00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:15.640
and are they sleeping with women or boys?

212
00:13:15.641 --> 00:13:17.410
Let's take the Catholic Church for example.

213
00:13:17.411 --> 00:13:19.660
Like let's really have this conversation.
I mean,

214
00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:24.250
of course there's people that are bad in any,
in any industry,

215
00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:25.450
in any position.

216
00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:28.720
I wouldn't know that percentage because I don't associate with those kinds of

217
00:13:28.721 --> 00:13:32.710
people regardless of where I'm at it.
Even if I'm out at,
at a bar having drinks,

218
00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:36.240
I'm not over there doing Kiki Kiki and staying up all night,

219
00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:37.900
getting fucking doing,
you know,
math.

220
00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:41.470
Now there's some important stars that might be doing that,
but that's not for me.

221
00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:43.440
<v 1>Okay,</v>

222
00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:47.670
<v 0>I have a sexually satisfying life.</v>

223
00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:57.520
Am I having the best 100% sex that I want?
No,

224
00:13:57.521 --> 00:14:00.940
because threesomes aren't happening or gs aren't happening.
Um,

225
00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:04.330
me getting to hook up with the people that I'm fantasizing about at any given

226
00:14:04.331 --> 00:14:05.290
moment isn't happening.

227
00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:10.120
My ideal sex like is this all ends in an orgy.

228
00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:13.660
That's my ideal sex life.
Okay,
that's reality.

229
00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:16.900
So am I living my best a hundred percent sex life?
No,

230
00:14:16.901 --> 00:14:21.700
because I'm truly held back like 70% of the time and I only get to have as much

231
00:14:21.701 --> 00:14:23.260
as is consensual

232
00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:29.670
<v 2>porn has released me from a lot of my insecurities.
It has opened my eyes.</v>

233
00:14:29.671 --> 00:14:33.420
It is finally made a good looking white man marginalized to see a different

234
00:14:33.421 --> 00:14:36.750
point of view because I used to be terrified to speak up and to have a voice and

235
00:14:36.751 --> 00:14:41.751
to say what it is that I want or need and now I am equipped with knowing how to

236
00:14:42.241 --> 00:14:44.100
do it,
knowing how to approach it and

237
00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:49.210
<v 0>yeah,
my life is completely happy and I'm having a lot of sex sometimes.</v>

238
00:14:49.211 --> 00:14:52.250
Mostly with myself.
No,
just a little handy.

239
00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:56.780
<v 2>Handy.
I stepped forward because I feel like,</v>

240
00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:59.960
I mean my,
once again I got it just me and my wife,

241
00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:03.600
but she brings the heat and we have that.

242
00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:09.620
You were just like,
yeah,
I apologize for just like,
yeah,

243
00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:11.720
she is.
Why she's down and

244
00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:18.500
needed the down as a woman,
I can tell you this,

245
00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:22.640
I can tell you this because we're very modest people.
When she sees this,

246
00:15:22.641 --> 00:15:25.600
she'll be like,
there's half of her that will be like,
uh,

247
00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:28.770
and then there's another half.
She'll be like,
I do.

248
00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:31.780
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

249
00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:38.630
<v 2>I stepped over.
You miss it.
That was great.</v>

250
00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:55.080
<v 4>Hey guys,
