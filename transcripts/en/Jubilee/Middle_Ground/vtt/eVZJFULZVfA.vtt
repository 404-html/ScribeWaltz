1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.330
In an effort to not have challenging conversations in this day and age.

2
00:00:03.331 --> 00:00:05.670
It's like,
well you do,
you like whatever's best for you.

3
00:00:05.671 --> 00:00:08.640
But then what if best for you is actually harmful to yourself and or others?

4
00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:27.393
<v 2>Okay,</v>

5
00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.350
<v 3>mine
is a top priority in my life.</v>

6
00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.963
<v 2>You never know</v>

7
00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.410
<v 4>bad.
You feel until you start feeling better than you've ever felt in your life.</v>

8
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.440
And I've been on both ends of the spectrum and down.

9
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.880
It's very different to now being like really focused on the mind,

10
00:00:54.881 --> 00:00:59.881
body and soul and like really having all parts just as equal as the other.

11
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:01.001
<v 0>For me,</v>

12
00:01:01.001 --> 00:01:06.001
I am as cancer survivor and so my entire life now is about making sure that I

13
00:01:07.121 --> 00:01:09.520
have a life,
you know,
to continue.
So yeah,

14
00:01:09.521 --> 00:01:14.521
I was diagnosed with lymphedema at age three which affects the circulation for

15
00:01:14.951 --> 00:01:16.420
me through my legs and feet.

16
00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.430
So health for me has always been at the top of my mind because if I don't take

17
00:01:21.431 --> 00:01:25.690
care of my body,
like I could have an amputated foot or leg.

18
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.400
So it's nothing that I play around with

19
00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.850
<v 4>all of my family,
almost his suffer from diabetes,</v>

20
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.530
heart disease and stuff like that.

21
00:01:32.531 --> 00:01:35.710
So that's why I'm extra conscious about my health because I don't want to come

22
00:01:35.711 --> 00:01:36.850
down with any of those diseases.

23
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:39.773
<v 3>Ah,</v>

24
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.500
<v 4>I'm working out consistently since I was 19 years old.</v>

25
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.160
I used to work out two hours a day,
but then I realize it's way too long.

26
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.180
So now my workout session with weights are about 45 minutes and then the rest is

27
00:01:57.181 --> 00:02:00.480
stretching and cardio and I spent a lot of time stretching because it allows me

28
00:02:00.481 --> 00:02:03.390
to get in the zone,
kind of like a meditation of sorts.

29
00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:04.850
<v 0>It's all mental,</v>

30
00:02:04.851 --> 00:02:09.851
like I go to the gym or workout or do something kind for my body in forms of

31
00:02:09.861 --> 00:02:14.090
movement every day because it keeps me sane.
Like if I don't go there,

32
00:02:14.091 --> 00:02:17.840
then I feel like something's missing and I get a little bit depressed.

33
00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.590
<v 3>Okay.
Singing all by myself back there.</v>

34
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.930
I was going to the gym regularly every day for like six months and then my life

35
00:02:27.941 --> 00:02:31.820
shifted.
I lost my father.
Like lot of things happened in my life is that um,

36
00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.840
threw off my whole routine.
And so the point when,

37
00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.560
when I was going to the gym so regularly I felt like my brain felt happier.

38
00:02:38.561 --> 00:02:40.690
Like I've gotten that feeling back in other ways.

39
00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.990
I have no desire in me to change my body in any way.

40
00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:45.940
I like my buckets a little bit.
Right.
Okay.

41
00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.340
<v 4>Not at all.</v>

42
00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.590
<v 0>See this is where we're going to get because I will tell you not every big</v>

43
00:02:51.591 --> 00:02:52.460
person wants to be

44
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:53.423
<v 2>mom.</v>

45
00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:55.600
<v 3>I am conscious</v>

46
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.980
<v 0>my mom had any weight watchers in junior high.</v>

47
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.930
Like so my relationship with food and what I'm putting into my body has been

48
00:03:07.931 --> 00:03:11.080
like completely can we curse fucked up like since the very,

49
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.320
very big headaches of your sugar addiction since I was a kid.

50
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.710
And it's like the binge eating,
like it makes you feel like everything,

51
00:03:17.711 --> 00:03:21.280
I can't have this,
this is the enemy.
So when I see it and I can have it,

52
00:03:21.281 --> 00:03:23.090
I'm like oh I want to eat it all.
Okay.

53
00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.580
<v 3>Every day I wake up,
I have a green smoothie.</v>

54
00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.560
I'm always very conscious of like what I'm putting into,
which I think is,

55
00:03:28.561 --> 00:03:32.460
I'm just gonna say the controversial statement I think is something that people

56
00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:36.750
would never think is true based off the size of my body and there's so much

57
00:03:36.751 --> 00:03:38.710
studies that are coming out like in terms of like your microbiome,

58
00:03:38.711 --> 00:03:39.780
like the micro biome that you have.

59
00:03:39.781 --> 00:03:43.170
Like you can literally eat green smoothies and eat like everything you're

60
00:03:43.171 --> 00:03:46.550
supposed to be eating and not lose the weight because we have an imbalance in

61
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.750
your microbiome and like,
and then people who are thin,

62
00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.530
they just really thin but they eat McDonald's every day.
Yep.

63
00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.550
<v 4>They don't realize is how much they're clogging their arteries and they die of</v>

64
00:03:55.551 --> 00:03:58.060
heart attacks more than quote unquote big

65
00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.973
<v 2>people.</v>

66
00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.020
<v 3>I receive negative feedback.</v>

67
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:06.003
<v 2>There you go.</v>

68
00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.630
<v 0>I would have people,
like some family members be like,</v>

69
00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.610
oh you look a little heavier than you did last year.

70
00:04:13.611 --> 00:04:16.850
And then other family members that were a lot more direct like,
oh,

71
00:04:16.851 --> 00:04:19.130
when are you going to lose the weight?
And it's been like that.

72
00:04:19.131 --> 00:04:20.450
I would say my whole life.

73
00:04:20.451 --> 00:04:23.180
And then we got to a point where I was getting compared to my little sister

74
00:04:23.181 --> 00:04:26.180
who's like beautiful and thin and it's like,

75
00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.360
it is so hard not to compare yourself to other people.

76
00:04:29.361 --> 00:04:33.740
It is so hard to have a healthy relationship with food and with fitness and just

77
00:04:33.741 --> 00:04:34.940
with other people in.

78
00:04:34.941 --> 00:04:39.560
It became so difficult to break out of that and to really love who I am inside.

79
00:04:39.561 --> 00:04:39.770
Right?

80
00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.030
<v 3>My step mom would take,
like if I had a wrapper of chips,
like in my room,</v>

81
00:04:44.031 --> 00:04:47.510
like she would put it on top of like Mike,
my dresser and say like,

82
00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.420
I'm off the reason why you're fat,
it's this.
It was like,
it was all very light,

83
00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.750
but it was super crazy psychological because I was like,

84
00:04:53.751 --> 00:04:55.760
we've never even discussed this before.

85
00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:02.190
<v 4>I'm from Texas,
we all eat soul food,
so everybody's eating the same shit food.</v>

86
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.850
So my mom,
250 pounds,
my brother,
350 pounds,

87
00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.560
but I saw I was eating the exact same foods and I didn't even know until I got

88
00:05:10.561 --> 00:05:13.840
around Los Angeles health conscious people.
I'm like,
what?

89
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.490
What do you mean to tell me you don't have fricking Bacon cheeseburger every

90
00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:18.570
single day?
I didn't know.

91
00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:20.970
<v 3>So like when you got until they,
what triggered it in your head that said,</v>

92
00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.960
oh this to me is the right way for me to like I want it to be a model.

93
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.590
The idea that you wanted to become a model and the only idea of model to you

94
00:05:28.591 --> 00:05:31.510
mapping thin or fit or whatever.
That beat me

95
00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:36.650
<v 4>all I saw because it wasn't as popular like plus size wasn't popular back then</v>

96
00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:37.673
when I was 18 yes,

97
00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:40.840
<v 0>results definitely now,
but it's still,</v>

98
00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.610
it's still opened up way more than it was.

99
00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:47.470
The conversation I will say is much more broad now.

100
00:05:47.471 --> 00:05:51.760
I feel like we're able to talk about these things a lot easier now than we were

101
00:05:51.761 --> 00:05:52.594
before,

102
00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:57.630
but what the actual way that the industry treats plus size models is totally

103
00:05:59.181 --> 00:06:00.014
different.

104
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.633
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

105
00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.080
<v 3>As an excuse not to here.</v>

106
00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:09.003
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

107
00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:15.070
<v 0>This question makes me a very passionate,</v>

108
00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:19.170
this is really big for me because I've been like come for from other body

109
00:06:19.171 --> 00:06:20.470
positive influencers,

110
00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:25.560
but I feel like the messages other people put out are very dangerous to a young

111
00:06:26.201 --> 00:06:30.010
woman who thinks that it's okay.
I don't care what size you are,

112
00:06:30.011 --> 00:06:34.540
it's not okay to sit and eat cheeseburgers and ice cream all day like that has

113
00:06:34.541 --> 00:06:35.600
nothing to do with your size.
Yeah.

114
00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:38.860
I think there's a difference between acceptance and agreement.

115
00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:42.850
So like you can accept your body and be in disagreement with the health

116
00:06:42.851 --> 00:06:44.380
situation that you have.
Right.

117
00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:48.660
<v 3>We hear fit experts always saying be skinny,
lose weight.</v>

118
00:06:48.661 --> 00:06:52.040
That's the healthy way to do it.
Like so how can we have your body,
your families,

119
00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:55.120
we don't say be fat because it's better for your heart.
It's,

120
00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:58.320
it's better for your soul.
It's better for your to say even what you just said,

121
00:06:58.321 --> 00:07:02.610
like body acceptance versus body agreement.
Like to you.
You might see one of us

122
00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:04.840
<v 0>be like,
oh they love their except their bodies,</v>

123
00:07:04.841 --> 00:07:06.880
but I'm sure they don't agree with what it looks like.
I mean,

124
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:10.750
I wouldn't know unless I talked with someone,
but like,
like whatever the number,

125
00:07:10.751 --> 00:07:12.940
like whatever like is coming up in terms of like,
you know,

126
00:07:12.941 --> 00:07:15.010
when you go to the doctor like that the other day,

127
00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.250
<v 3>it's not even Steven better as fit people.</v>

128
00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:20.970
When you see a person who is overweight or fat or obese,
however you want,

129
00:07:20.971 --> 00:07:23.130
whatever term you wanna use,
what's the first thing happens in your head?

130
00:07:23.131 --> 00:07:24.030
Did you think?
Like,
oh,

131
00:07:24.031 --> 00:07:27.570
like it's great that they accept themselves but they could use to lose weight or

132
00:07:27.571 --> 00:07:28.680
what is your first thought?

133
00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:33.410
<v 4>First.
Dot.
No,
no one's like born that way.
So you,</v>

134
00:07:33.411 --> 00:07:35.870
you liked there's habits and things that you observed

135
00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:37.690
<v 3>but you actually can be born with that.</v>

136
00:07:37.691 --> 00:07:40.970
I like eat the exact same thing and it can be two different people.

137
00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:44.080
<v 4>How you're raised parenting and stuff like that.
Um,</v>

138
00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:45.660
I didn't really know what to expect today.

139
00:07:45.661 --> 00:07:49.140
I didn't know how the body positive individuals we're going to come across.

140
00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:51.510
I didn't know if they were for healthy lifestyle or not,

141
00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:54.870
but I think it's beautiful that you guys acknowledge how important it is to keep

142
00:07:54.871 --> 00:07:55.704
yourself healthy.

143
00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:02.390
<v 0>Do I feel like there are people in the body positive community that say,</v>

144
00:08:02.391 --> 00:08:06.680
well I'm just happy being fat and I'm just going to lay down and just do that?

145
00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:09.470
Yeah,
absolutely.
Absolutely.

146
00:08:09.471 --> 00:08:14.471
You Ha I fat pride Hashtag fat pride is like was something that was going on.

147
00:08:15.051 --> 00:08:17.500
It's like a while.
Yeah.
Big Buzzword.

148
00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:21.200
Everyone just throws out like you said something at some point that Bazi body

149
00:08:21.201 --> 00:08:23.570
positivity and like health and stuff is different.

150
00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:28.580
Like is that one everybody thinks the actual body positive community was created

151
00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:33.740
to give a platform to bodies that have been marginalized in our society.

152
00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:37.600
That's what it was actually created for big bodies,
disabilities,

153
00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:42.440
any Bonnie Raitt different races and I want to scream because I'm like,

154
00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:46.850
actually this is not meant for you.
This is meant for bodies who,

155
00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:48.410
who don't have a voice.

156
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:52.250
The fitness community is the reason why the buys are body positive.

157
00:08:52.251 --> 00:08:56.160
Community exists.
And I think that as a community it's important

158
00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:00.150
<v 3>for you guys to be a little bit more inclusive.
People come up to me,</v>

159
00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:06.630
it was really great talking to you guys or not.

160
00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:09.900
I think we really did find a middle ground.
Um,
but we did.

161
00:09:09.901 --> 00:09:13.200
I think we all realize it.
It's like not,
it's not,
this line isn't alive.

162
00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:15.340
Pride and ego out.
Let's Friggen,
no,

163
00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.560
I love how the actual line it was actually on this side.

164
00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:21.810
