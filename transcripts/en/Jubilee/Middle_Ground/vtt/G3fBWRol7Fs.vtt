1
00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:01.530
If we just take God out of it.

2
00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:06.930
Might there not be something you're scientific beliefs can't explain.

3
00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:23.293
<v 1>My name is Matt.</v>

4
00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.190
<v 2>I'm 41 years old.
I'm a pastor.
I'm Gil k,
uh,
40,</v>

5
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.320
40 years old.
I,
uh,
let minister but his church.
I'm Andrew.

6
00:00:33.321 --> 00:00:34.820
I'm 42 and I'm a chemist.

7
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.260
<v 3>Okay.</v>

8
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.290
<v 4>I'm Jess.
I'm 36 and I'm a volcanologist.</v>

9
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.670
<v 3>I'm dawn.
I'm 64.
I'm a paleontologist and geologist.</v>

10
00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.280
<v 0>I'm Amy.
I'm 53,
and I am a rabbi.</v>

11
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.580
<v 2>This is literally my greatest fear that I'd be all known in the circle.</v>

12
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.550
I believe that this world was created.
Uh,

13
00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.580
I've placed my faith in a god that is infinitely creative in what he's made.

14
00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.630
He then deserves my worship and my affection as the last night I was talking to

15
00:01:22.821 --> 00:01:26.660
my wife,
I was like,
what if there's a question that I'm the one,
she's like,

16
00:01:26.661 --> 00:01:28.730
just stay where you are.
I was like,
I don't know.

17
00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.210
<v 3>Big problem.
Is that mean to you?
Start talking with creator and I babble.</v>

18
00:01:32.211 --> 00:01:35.380
Creation is in most of my entire career as an evolutionary biologist and

19
00:01:35.381 --> 00:01:36.220
paleontologist,

20
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.050
it brings in a whole category of things that violate my rules as a scientist as

21
00:01:41.051 --> 00:01:44.320
well.
And when I stepped back from that,

22
00:01:44.321 --> 00:01:46.960
especially when I step back where I started as a religious person when I was

23
00:01:46.961 --> 00:01:50.920
younger,
I look at this and they say,
you know,
if anything,

24
00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.210
what we see now about the universe shows how poorly designed it is now sloppy it

25
00:01:55.211 --> 00:01:59.500
is and how painful it is and all these things which don't speak to a very

26
00:01:59.501 --> 00:02:02.320
benevolent creator because if anything it makes him look bad.

27
00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.870
<v 0>Um,
I don't believe in a supernatural God.
I'm a reconstructionist Jew.
For me,</v>

28
00:02:06.871 --> 00:02:11.871
I don't rely on a supernatural creator in order to remain astounded at the

29
00:02:13.711 --> 00:02:18.560
beauty of this world.
It's sloppy.
It's the world,
right?

30
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.850
It's the world.
We're sloppy,
the world of sloppy,

31
00:02:20.851 --> 00:02:24.340
but it's also incredibly magical and yeah,

32
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.150
and worthy of awe and um,

33
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.500
and respect and that it's here is amazing that we're here is amazing and I want

34
00:02:34.021 --> 00:02:36.750
to live in relationship to that amazement.

35
00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:41.163
<v 2>Okay.</v>

36
00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.450
<v 4>I never look to science to go like,
is murder right or wrong?</v>

37
00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.810
I look to science to say how many murders were committed last week?
You know,

38
00:02:55.811 --> 00:02:58.390
that,
that's what I want to know.
And then say,
is there a trend?

39
00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.050
What is the of these murders,
blah,
blah blah.
And then we use a,
you know,

40
00:03:02.051 --> 00:03:06.190
we use different tools,
I guess is the best way of putting it to,
um,

41
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.470
to assess whether or not we should be murdering people.

42
00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.390
<v 2>Where did,
where did those morals come from then?</v>

43
00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:12.950
<v 3>I think they're innate in humans.</v>

44
00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.900
All societies have had certain things that agree on him.
Carlos,

45
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.960
a religious background and so on.

46
00:03:17.961 --> 00:03:21.770
We don't require a deity or any kind of religion to give us those things and we

47
00:03:21.771 --> 00:03:24.470
come with them as part of our species.
And for me,

48
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.140
it's not so much a science can answer more questions,

49
00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.990
but science certainly can guide us in a lot of ways,

50
00:03:29.991 --> 00:03:33.560
especially when moral questions and conflict with reality is we've now learned.

51
00:03:33.561 --> 00:03:34.394
Yeah,

52
00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:35.543
<v 1>okay.</v>

53
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:36.713
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

54
00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:51.010
I've got serious gaps in my faith that require as supernatural answer.

55
00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.950
I mean,
I can't,
I can't understand.

56
00:03:54.951 --> 00:03:59.750
And fathom the complexities of the universe all on my own.
I'm a Christian.

57
00:03:59.751 --> 00:04:00.860
I had at a church service,

58
00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.660
someone had a hurt shoulder and they said my shoulder really hard,

59
00:04:03.661 --> 00:04:06.590
so you pray for my shoulder to get better.
I'm be honest with you,

60
00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:11.570
I have about 5% faith that that's going to work out,
but I pray for him.

61
00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.960
I put my hand on her shoulder and I said,
you know,

62
00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:18.440
I want this shoulder to get healed in Jesus name.
And I walked away thinking,

63
00:04:18.441 --> 00:04:22.250
oh no.
Another disappointing the person who didn't get healed today.
Well,

64
00:04:22.251 --> 00:04:24.770
the next morning that person called me and say,
you wouldn't believe it.

65
00:04:24.771 --> 00:04:29.520
My shoulder feels a 100% better.
I still don't have a good answer to that.
Um,

66
00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.620
but I just know every time I get an answer or an opportunity to extra my

67
00:04:33.621 --> 00:04:36.110
exercise,
my faith in a supernatural way,

68
00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:38.810
I want to take that opportunity because I just don't know what the answer might

69
00:04:38.811 --> 00:04:42.800
be.
It could be something terrific.
I totally agree with you.
I liked you.
It's,

70
00:04:42.801 --> 00:04:46.130
when you say 5% I pretty much feel the same way.
Yeah,

71
00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:47.840
I didn't buy hometown in Japan.

72
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.380
We have this kind of service to set up console the spirits in the lines.

73
00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.360
When we chant we're like out,
you know,
an hour or half an hour maybe.

74
00:04:56.361 --> 00:04:59.660
Then everybody feels like,
oh you feel so peaceful.

75
00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:05.000
But then I can't quite explain it like logically and that's,

76
00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.700
that's stuff that sits separately shin in that situation.

77
00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.770
<v 3>Science is all about understanding what we can understand and the science,</v>

78
00:05:14.771 --> 00:05:17.700
you're pretty much not allowed to even consider the supernatural because it's

79
00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.660
beyond testable hypotheses.

80
00:05:19.661 --> 00:05:23.800
It's beyond anything that you can evaluate in any what we might call an

81
00:05:23.801 --> 00:05:24.700
objective manner.

82
00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:29.050
We are comfortable with the idea that we do not know something and we say we did

83
00:05:29.051 --> 00:05:32.050
not know something and that was some day we may find the answer.
We may not.

84
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.870
<v 2>There's a lot out there that we can't explain.</v>

85
00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.260
It has absolutely nothing to do with my beliefs.
I was raised Catholic and um,

86
00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.570
I'm just as confused now as I was then about what's really going on.
You know,

87
00:05:43.571 --> 00:05:46.420
there,
there,
there is the small amount of stuff we can explain.

88
00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.630
I don't need to have a belief about it.
I don't even need to go beyond that.

89
00:05:49.631 --> 00:05:54.310
And just just to decide that it's magnificent and terrifying all at the same

90
00:05:54.311 --> 00:05:58.070
time and just kind of leave it at that.
So I think your answer to the question

91
00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.910
<v 0>would have been yes.</v>

92
00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:04.560
I mean cause I think you might agree that there's stuff that you can't even know

93
00:06:05.841 --> 00:06:07.640
to test yet.

94
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:11.480
So maybe there's something beyond scientific theory and proof that we don't even

95
00:06:11.481 --> 00:06:14.990
know yet.
And I'm not saying God,
I don't need,
just take God out of it.

96
00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:20.360
Might there not be something right.
Your scientific beliefs can't explain.

97
00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.200
<v 3>That's right.
Certainly.
But it also,
in my philosophy,</v>

98
00:06:23.201 --> 00:06:26.590
I don't see any point in putting any kind of supernatural label on it.
Right.

99
00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.820
As an explanation.
It's just not solving

100
00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:29.793
<v 2>problem.</v>

101
00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:34.733
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

102
00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:44.180
<v 2>Well I'm so glad you're with me cause I didn't want to be here all by myself.</v>

103
00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:51.130
I mean I just see purpose for our lives that extends beyond the here and now

104
00:06:52.371 --> 00:06:56.450
that there is an eternity that God wants to have with us.

105
00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:01.480
His love for us is so deep that it desires to have a continued relationship with

106
00:07:01.521 --> 00:07:05.000
us.
Uh,
as,
as,
as far as time goes on.

107
00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:06.870
<v 5>Because I live in Long Beach,</v>

108
00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:11.400
I go down to the beach and I see the waves in the ocean at,
at,
at the beach.

109
00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:16.800
They,
they come ashore and they leave.
We compare that to life.

110
00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:21.060
We take different shapes and different forums and the length of the way,

111
00:07:21.061 --> 00:07:22.230
we have no idea.

112
00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:26.520
You'll show up in different locations which are happening to control the idea

113
00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:29.700
that we just,
this moment trolleys shape that we have this,

114
00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:33.150
this life and trying to preserve it in how,

115
00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:37.950
and then we kind of missing the whole point that we are actually that greater

116
00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:38.793
ocean

117
00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:44.820
<v 0>in my limited capacity as a individual human,
like in this form and this shape.</v>

118
00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:49.890
I have no idea how can I possibly have any idea about what that being ocean is

119
00:07:49.891 --> 00:07:54.520
going to mean or B.
And so I know that,
uh,

120
00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:59.280
I will continue to be part of the universe,
but not as,
as me.

121
00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:01.020
Not as this.

122
00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.660
<v 3>I would agree with that.
I mean,</v>

123
00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:07.590
I see no evidence from anything that I can observe or anything that was debt

124
00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:12.130
goes on that is more than just wishful thinking that humans in some form are

125
00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:15.420
going to exist in some afterlife or they're recognizable and their identities

126
00:08:15.421 --> 00:08:16.254
carry on.

127
00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:19.290
<v 4>Um,
when I was a kid,
I asked my dad,
um,</v>

128
00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:24.260
if our pets would be waiting for us in heaven when we died.
And my dad said no,

129
00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:28.640
and I was shocked and I was like,
why would there not be pets in heaven?

130
00:08:28.641 --> 00:08:31.730
And my dad's like,
well,
there are animals.
And I'm like,
why not my animals?

131
00:08:31.731 --> 00:08:35.450
And he's like,
well,
they're just like a generic cat and a generic dog.
And I went,

132
00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:39.200
wait,
what?
And so at that point,
that's when I started to question like,

133
00:08:39.201 --> 00:08:43.580
wait a minute,
what happens next?
And,
uh,
and yeah,
I'm,
I'm kind of a,
you know,

134
00:08:43.581 --> 00:08:46.010
with a lot of you guys here and just saying that,
look,
you know,

135
00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:48.350
wouldn't it be great if we could go on and on and on?

136
00:08:48.351 --> 00:08:50.180
But I think because we don't see any evidence for it,

137
00:08:50.181 --> 00:08:53.650
I have to be in the camp of,
well,
we get this one shot.
Make the most of it.

138
00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:57.030
Do the best you can,
and then when it's done,
you know,
don't have any regrets,

139
00:08:57.031 --> 00:09:00.270
you know,
live with doing as much as you could.
That is good.

140
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:03.810
So that you will live on in the memories of those who stay behind.

141
00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.730
<v 2>Oh,
I'm so sorry.
Your Dad told you,
your dog's not going to heaven.</v>

142
00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:12.070
What a crushing thing.
Uh,
you know,
all good dogs go to heaven.

143
00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:16.840
It must be true.
I think he was trying to do like,
let me down gently,

144
00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:22.840
like some days I'm like totally zen.
I'm totally like solely,
they're like,

145
00:09:22.841 --> 00:09:25.900
it's okay.
It's all one and I will just not exist.

146
00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:29.470
I'm usually not as afraid of death as I am of dying.
Like I'm,

147
00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:34.060
I'm afraid of dying because I've seen some really bad dying.

148
00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:38.350
I'm very afraid of pain and of,
you know,
the process of dying.

149
00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:41.770
<v 5>All right.
I lost both my parents are from counselor,</v>

150
00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:46.060
so I witnessed the both process.
My mom died,
uh,

151
00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:50.860
over,
um,
30 years ago.
And,
uh,

152
00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:55.840
it was,
it was painful to witness that are my mom.

153
00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:59.710
My mom kind of was health deteriorate.
My Dad,
uh,

154
00:09:59.711 --> 00:10:04.430
went through the same process but then he was runs writing letters as,

155
00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:05.030
uh,

156
00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:09.700
just really coincides woods boorish teachings that I'm having a wonderful day.

157
00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:12.640
I'm really grateful for everybody who support us.

158
00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:17.650
We have a saying that every day is a,
as you say,
the greatest day.

159
00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:21.070
I can see that,
you know,
intellectually I can understand it intellectually,

160
00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:25.040
but I just wasn't sure if I could,
I could feel if I,

161
00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:29.080
I would be able to say something like that if I'm put in that situation.

162
00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:46.440
<v 2>Man,
I'm such a skeptic and that includes questioning my own,
my own beliefs.</v>

163
00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:49.680
Um,
especially if I form a hypothesis and I'm working on an experiment.

164
00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:53.580
I mean you always kind of wanted to go a certain way and you have to do your

165
00:10:53.581 --> 00:10:57.180
best to remove that,
that bias.
And then,
um,
some,

166
00:10:57.390 --> 00:11:00.360
a lot of times if you're in research just doesn't work.

167
00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:02.080
<v 4>One of the things I tell students,</v>

168
00:11:02.081 --> 00:11:05.890
cause I work with students a lot with my nonprofit organization and I tell them,

169
00:11:05.891 --> 00:11:06.101
you know,

170
00:11:06.101 --> 00:11:09.460
as they're journeying into becoming scientists and they come from all sorts of

171
00:11:09.461 --> 00:11:11.080
different backgrounds and I just say,
look,

172
00:11:11.081 --> 00:11:14.230
don't ever work with anyone who's afraid to admit that they don't know something

173
00:11:14.231 --> 00:11:17.020
or that they're wrong.
Like those are really important qualities,

174
00:11:17.021 --> 00:11:19.120
whether it's in science or any aspect of life.

175
00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:23.140
They'll the whole fun and being a scientist is trying to break things.
Uh,

176
00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:27.220
and I actually wanted to start a journal of scientific mistakes so that we could

177
00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:29.080
share with each other what went wrong.

178
00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:31.270
Because too often we only talk about the successes.

179
00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:35.500
And I think it's very valuable to also know what failure is and what it teaches

180
00:11:35.501 --> 00:11:36.334
us.

181
00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:39.260
<v 5>Cause there's such a healthy thing.
I always think it's a healthier thing.</v>

182
00:11:39.261 --> 00:11:42.740
So when I've already see younger monastics or priests,
like yeah,

183
00:11:42.741 --> 00:11:43.820
go ahead and question,

184
00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:47.960
question me or question which you do and then be okay.

185
00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:51.920
And you need to understand,
understand intellectually.

186
00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:55.450
But at the same,
I want you to understand their things.

187
00:11:55.451 --> 00:11:58.000
That's beyond this intellectual understanding.

188
00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:03.420
So that's an in Breen I'm recognizable part of understand that comes only

189
00:12:04.061 --> 00:12:04.990
through experience.

190
00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:14.860
<v 0>Really interesting.
Nice to meet you.
Good to meet you too.</v>

191
00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:19.400
