1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.440
The area that I grew up in.
Sometimes a gun is the only way to protect yourself.

2
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.320
Yeah,
anti gun.
You don't,
you don't want nobody to have guns.

3
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.300
But then that's going to put my family at dangerous.

4
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:17.830
<v 2>The pull to the left.</v>

5
00:00:17.831 --> 00:00:21.340
I'm going to have all my pro gun people go stand on the edge of that light and

6
00:00:21.341 --> 00:00:22.990
all my anti gun people on the other side.

7
00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:36.290
<v 0>First statement is I think my views on guns could change.</v>

8
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.300
<v 2>Oh,
I felt like anyone's views can change on things,</v>

9
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.230
so I'm kind of surprised that nobody felt like it could change at all.

10
00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.770
They don't think that I could change completely the other side,

11
00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.250
but I would definitely be open to like looking at it from a different

12
00:01:00.251 --> 00:01:01.084
perspective.

13
00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.630
<v 0>I think that my stance is very accommodating to both sides.</v>

14
00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.741
That said,

15
00:01:08.741 --> 00:01:12.340
I feel really solid about kind of the what I've learned and what I think is

16
00:01:12.341 --> 00:01:16.240
possible.
So I feel really solid about that.
Although I'm,
you know,

17
00:01:16.241 --> 00:01:19.150
open to accommodating for people's needs,
you know,

18
00:01:19.151 --> 00:01:22.150
people's wishes with their rights.
My name is Aaron Clayton.

19
00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.280
After the Orlando shooting,
I realized that my community was very much a target.

20
00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.260
I had to get involved to do something.

21
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.500
Sometimes I think people on the other side of the issue don't care about me or

22
00:01:36.171 --> 00:01:37.460
my loved ones lives.

23
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.700
<v 1>I got to go with that one.
Got to go with that one at the scene.</v>

24
00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:48.800
<v 0>Um,
I mean,</v>

25
00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.940
the area that I grew up in and why I come from a lot of,

26
00:01:52.941 --> 00:01:57.140
you may not be able to understand that sometimes a gun is the only way to

27
00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.490
protect yourself and we all believed there should be certain rules to,

28
00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.030
to getting them.
But on my side of the earth,
there is no gun laws.

29
00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.000
My Name is Sandy Hill.
Regardless of whatever you say,
there's always going to be,

30
00:02:10.001 --> 00:02:13.900
guns is always going to be violence in the world.
And I got family protect.

31
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.333
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

32
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.360
<v 2>I don't think y'all don't care about me or my family,
you know?</v>

33
00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.320
I think we all care about each other and each other's lives.
Others,
you know,

34
00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.213
loved ones

35
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.510
<v 0>I don't care about.
Yeah.
I'm trying to protect me in mind.
Yeah,
that's,</v>

36
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.280
that's my reason of saying that nobody else cares about it because I'm pretty

37
00:02:31.281 --> 00:02:35.270
sure y'all have the same insight.
Like you're anti gun,
you don't,

38
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.860
you don't want nobody to have guns.

39
00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:38.840
But then that's going to put my family at danger.

40
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.310
<v 2>I don't want,
that's not at all.</v>

41
00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.810
I think that that's is how I feel like the pro con people,

42
00:02:46.811 --> 00:02:47.660
a lot of times they're like,

43
00:02:47.661 --> 00:02:51.600
well it's never going to be solved like don and never going to end and like it

44
00:02:51.601 --> 00:02:53.720
won't and you're absolutely correct,

45
00:02:53.721 --> 00:02:56.820
but there's a bunch of ways to decrease it.

46
00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.190
<v 0>I've been in a situation in which my life</v>

47
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.060
<v 2>was in danger.</v>

48
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.080
I grew up in Saint Louis,
so we'd go downtown where is a huge amount of violence.

49
00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.070
We are home depot and this guy's starting to gather around my dad's truck and

50
00:03:17.071 --> 00:03:19.860
I'm in it alone.
I'm 14 years old and let it just,

51
00:03:19.861 --> 00:03:23.850
I had to pull my gun out while I'm shaking and Lou just set it on my lap and to

52
00:03:23.851 --> 00:03:28.200
show that it ended up potentially violent,
potentially robbery,
you know,

53
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.920
I don't think people automatically are born or like I'm pro guide.

54
00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.550
Like I think what you experienced in your life makes you that way.

55
00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.020
My name is Sarah.

56
00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.230
It wasn't until recently that my opinion changed on how I felt about guns and

57
00:03:42.361 --> 00:03:47.100
then I became program in order to protect me and my future family.

58
00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.080
I was never programmed before and then some guy broke into my place and rate me

59
00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.120
and I couldn't run away.

60
00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.840
I can do anything like literally had the lay there and take it,

61
00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:02.520
but I knew that if I had a gun at that point in time on my nightstand,

62
00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.710
I've would've defended myself.

63
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.720
I think America has a problem with mass shootings.

64
00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.730
I think we all should step forward for that one.
Cool.

65
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.360
It'd be ignorant to say it's not an issue.

66
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.980
Like I don't want anyone to die.
Like I don't want to see these school shootings.

67
00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.630
I don't want people to get hurt.
We're all for protecting ourselves.

68
00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.880
But I think like when guns are not in the right hands,

69
00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.350
then it becomes an issue.

70
00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.870
And I don't think any west support that at the end of the day.

71
00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.530
So you all for like stricter gun laws or no,

72
00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.800
I mean there's a point where it goes too far.

73
00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:48.570
I don't think I need to take a 5,000 question questionnaire for a psychological

74
00:04:48.571 --> 00:04:51.570
tests,
you know,
like isn't that worth it?

75
00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.470
And like I'm not saying that that's necessarily what we would definitely do or

76
00:04:55.471 --> 00:04:59.910
whatever,
but like a 5,000 questionnaire or like people's lives.

77
00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.200
But it sounds like,
wouldn't you rather,

78
00:05:01.201 --> 00:05:03.780
would you be willing to go through the same process to get an automobile

79
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.960
training,
licensing,
renewable licensing?
Yeah.
Yeah.

80
00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:13.500
But not a psychological test.
I think it doesn't have to be so extensive,

81
00:05:13.501 --> 00:05:14.340
which you're saying,

82
00:05:14.341 --> 00:05:19.341
but it's sad how someone can come into a gun show and have a lot of money,

83
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.070
buy whatever they want.
So a little,

84
00:05:23.071 --> 00:05:28.071
maybe a little card or something and get like maybe 20 guns and no one's asking

85
00:05:28.171 --> 00:05:29.610
you just because you have money.

86
00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:33.690
A simple back brown check can just do a lot for people.

87
00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.270
But I also think that a lot of people like because they don't want to have the

88
00:05:36.271 --> 00:05:39.570
conversation about gun violence and they switch over and say like,

89
00:05:39.571 --> 00:05:42.150
oh it's mental illness and like that needs to be talked about too.

90
00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.700
But gun violence is a separate issue that also like really needs to be talked

91
00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:48.480
about.
If my life was in danger,

92
00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:52.620
I would kill hell.
Yeah.
Can I walk fast?

93
00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.010
No,
I really don't think I would have like in,
I don't know

94
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:02.390
<v 0>if I would have nobody,
nobody has it in them until the moment comes.</v>

95
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.420
Like literally fear doesn't even become a thing anymore.

96
00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:08.940
Like it disappears and it's like fight or flight.
Yeah.

97
00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:13.890
Like in you either freeze and die or you make it.
Yeah.

98
00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:17.190
And after that end of the day,
I'm going to make it,
some people don't got it.

99
00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.760
Then you can always just,
you know,

100
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.590
shoot him in a place where they won't be able to move.

101
00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:24.530
That's what some people think of.
When I went to,
uh,

102
00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:26.270
I did my carrying conceal class,
they said,

103
00:06:26.271 --> 00:06:29.600
if you're trying to shoot him in the leg,
you have enough time to get away or,

104
00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:33.600
or to realize you're not in danger.
Your life is in danger,
you know?

105
00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:34.790
And so they said,
you know,

106
00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:36.530
if you're pulling a gun out and you're shooting somebody,

107
00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:39.830
you're shooting to kill.
I guess I just,
I don't understand.

108
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.240
I understand fighting for your life.
That's why I came to this,

109
00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:45.410
to the center for sure.

110
00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:49.100
But like all this talk about like how to protect ourselves,

111
00:06:49.101 --> 00:06:51.680
how to be in these situations,
blah,
blah,
blah.
It's like,
again,

112
00:06:51.681 --> 00:06:55.430
we're just increasing guns and I,
I keep just one,

113
00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:59.630
I want to bring us back to like,
how can we combat this from the other end?

114
00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:03.740
I don't want to carry guns.
I don't want to have guns in my club.
I don't want to,

115
00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:07.430
I want to be there to dance.
I don't want to have a firearm on my leg.

116
00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:11.880
And like he was trying to society.
So you rather just not have one.
I know,

117
00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:16.760
I don't think we can track from that.
Other countries have done that,

118
00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.440
but you're taking the right away.

119
00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:23.850
But if I can prove to you that there are ways to enact gun reform that will

120
00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:26.540
decrease the amount of guns out there,

121
00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:30.980
increase education and not hurt the ability of law abiding citizens to have

122
00:07:30.981 --> 00:07:35.750
access to firearms,
would you be willing to discuss ways to do that?
Yeah,
I'm all,

123
00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:38.960
like I said,
I'm all for education,
but I don't think like at the end of the day,

124
00:07:38.961 --> 00:07:41.750
like if someone's trying to kill me,
I'm going to kill them.

125
00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:46.970
But that is you're allowed to right now you're allowed to have that gun.

126
00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:51.290
And so we keep kind of saying what we're is already in place.

127
00:07:51.291 --> 00:07:54.110
This is already possible to have all of these guns.

128
00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:58.190
Like how can we start looking at this and you know,

129
00:07:58.191 --> 00:08:02.630
changing our minds and our Congress,
our government,
you know,

130
00:08:02.631 --> 00:08:05.240
leaders' minds,
you guys keep talking about education,

131
00:08:05.241 --> 00:08:10.241
but that is not a reality and that we're not allowed to instill reform.

132
00:08:10.791 --> 00:08:15.320
That gives us gun education.
So it's just like layman's ideas,

133
00:08:15.321 --> 00:08:18.350
batting around ideas on how to kill,
how to kill.

134
00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:24.200
I'm overall against violence at the end of the day.
Um,

135
00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:29.030
I wouldn't need or want to have a gun if there wasn't violence in the world,

136
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:33.920
but sometimes it's a right because it's a nest necessity sometimes.

137
00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:36.080
So how do we change,

138
00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:41.110
how do we do that where we start changing the conversation where people don't

139
00:08:42.021 --> 00:08:45.250
immediately relate pro gun to uh,

140
00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:48.900
or don't eat that program can equal pro gun reform.
Oh,

141
00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:51.380
I mean that's why we're all here.
That's why we're all here.

142
00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:56.190
We're all risking something by saying something.
I'll always taught that.
Don't

143
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:57.120
<v 2>ever,
um,</v>

144
00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:01.320
like state your opinion on hot topics because you're just asking for it at that

145
00:09:01.321 --> 00:09:02.154
point.

146
00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:07.260
But I feel like you have to speak up cause being silent as being just as guilty.

147
00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:13.430
I think the society needs to learn to speak like educated people need to sit

148
00:09:14.791 --> 00:09:16.890
down and come together and talk about things.

149
00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:21.900
You guys have something to say and we said it and we accept all of each other's

150
00:09:21.901 --> 00:09:24.450
views.
I told her,
we will not leave hating each other.

151
00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:27.440
Art or boy does it right.

152
00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:39.050
<v 0>I'm Taylor.
Nice to meet you.
Uh,</v>

153
00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:42.900
we disagree sometimes and it's okay because this is middle ground.

154
00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:43.890
This is a middle ground.

155
00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:47.880
We hope you guys liked it and we hope that we can continue to bridge people

156
00:09:47.881 --> 00:09:51.030
together through videos like this.

158

Yup.
