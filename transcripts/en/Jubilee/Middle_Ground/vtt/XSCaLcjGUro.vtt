00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.010
Look at a human being and say,

2
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.330
you deserve to be under one roof with the people that you love,

3
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.770
but does that give you a right to break into my house?
[inaudible] house?

4
00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:12.123
Yeah.

5
00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:17.103
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

6
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.630
<v 0>Hello,</v>

7
00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.630
I'm Adam [inaudible] and I am a proud undocumented storyteller and my name is

8
00:00:34.191 --> 00:00:38.100
Swan Camilo [inaudible] for the green goes C.

9
00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.840
I'm a singer,
an actor.
I'm done jelly.

10
00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.860
I'm a spoken word artist and a paralegal and I was undocumented for 12 years.

11
00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.730
Jonathan Miranda and I'm pro ball.
Hi,
I'm Julie.
I'm,

12
00:00:49.731 --> 00:00:53.490
I'm a Grad student and I'm also undocumented.
Jasmine,
Anna Saavedra.

13
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.030
I'm an immigrant.
I came to this country through the legal process.

14
00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.520
The first statement is I feel threatened by the other side.

15
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.100
<v 1>That's
course.</v>

16
00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:19.060
<v 0>The day after Trump's inauguration,
I phoned my mother,</v>

17
00:01:19.061 --> 00:01:24.061
Essex am trying to find out how much it would cost to ship our washing machine

18
00:01:25.571 --> 00:01:28.150
to the Dominican Republic.
She said,

19
00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.420
I just want you to be ready in case immigration comes.

20
00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.810
Ever since it has felt like my family and my community has been taking punches

21
00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.200
over and over and over again,

22
00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.470
trying to prove our humanity that we deserve.

23
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.060
Basic human rights.

24
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.380
I think it was never about a very specific country and a very specific legal

25
00:01:51.381 --> 00:01:54.950
status.
I think it was a fear of everyone who is different.

26
00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.480
He put forth the Muslim ban and through that process a lot of people lost their

27
00:01:59.481 --> 00:02:02.480
green card.
There's their permanent residence status too,

28
00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.850
and after that he came after birthright citizenship,

29
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.030
undocumented immigrants and I think Mexican undocumented immigrants in

30
00:02:08.031 --> 00:02:10.100
particular were the first to take the hit.

31
00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.670
But that category is going to continue to grow and it's going to consume a lot

32
00:02:13.671 --> 00:02:14.340
of us.

33
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.173
<v 2>Well,</v>

34
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:20.210
I feel that tag by the other side Jews because I love this country juice because

35
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.070
I respect the law here.

36
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.250
I feel attack where they cannot feel free to support my precedent because they

37
00:02:28.621 --> 00:02:33.621
profiled me as a bad person just because I want the best for the people in this

38
00:02:35.431 --> 00:02:39.060
country.
We said the t word

39
00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.490
as a Latino,
I'm already putting this box that I'm supposed to think this way.

40
00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.240
I'm supposed to act this way.
I'm supposed to just assumingly go with my group.

41
00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.800
Trump said very specific things and that gets twisted around and presented as

42
00:02:52.801 --> 00:02:55.980
like,
well,
he thinks all people,
all Mexicans are rapists.
I was like,

43
00:02:55.981 --> 00:02:58.560
that's not what he said.
The Muslim ban,
it wasn't a Muslim ban.

44
00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.650
They're banning specific countries that were already banned under Obama,

45
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.970
so to call it a Muslim ban is a very wide umbrella of association.

46
00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.910
<v 3>Eileen,
I feel threatened by his,
by media.</v>

47
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.900
It is by identity politics is that you were,
JC was saying like first off,

48
00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.910
I don't have a problem with the stories you guys have.

49
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.890
You come to America for betterment,

50
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.090
but sadly you're a minority of another minority of people that do come across

51
00:03:22.091 --> 00:03:25.060
the border for other not good intent purposes.

52
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.270
The reason why I talked mostly about Mexico is because it's right on our

53
00:03:28.271 --> 00:03:32.110
southern border is right there and our border is totally whack.
It's weak.

54
00:03:32.111 --> 00:03:32.890
It's nothing there.

55
00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.580
That's why I voted for Trump and a wall is because even though you didn't come

56
00:03:36.581 --> 00:03:38.860
through the legal process,
I still want you to be protected.

57
00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:40.550
<v 2>But also,
you know,</v>

58
00:03:40.551 --> 00:03:45.551
president Trump hubby saying that he wanted to help the good illegal people,

59
00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.660
the people who really love this country.
I mean because you need to Sec.
No,

60
00:03:50.661 --> 00:03:51.890
everyone is good.

61
00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:57.220
I mean you can be here illegally and be respectful to this country.

62
00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:58.550
I love this country.

63
00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.000
<v 0>I think there's a theme here,
this theme of Legality,</v>

64
00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:07.060
the way in which Trump supporters have used this idea of legality has been

65
00:04:07.221 --> 00:04:10.190
completely incorrect and dismissive of this country's history.

66
00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.600
If you were to use nothing argument 60 years ago when segregation was legal,

67
00:04:14.601 --> 00:04:15.201
you could have said,

68
00:04:15.201 --> 00:04:20.201
I don't want a black people and this and this restaurant because the law says

69
00:04:20.391 --> 00:04:22.970
that white people and black people shouldn't be in the same spot.

70
00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.980
I have the right to impose that law.
Last change laws can be unjust.

71
00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.340
I believe in America first.

72
00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:34.063
<v 1>Awesome.</v>

73
00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.130
<v 3>I actually believe in America first,</v>

74
00:04:41.131 --> 00:04:43.890
but I believe every country should have that.
Anything.
Oh,

75
00:04:43.891 --> 00:04:46.860
do you want America first?
Cause even though these people are not undocumented,

76
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.320
the moment I hope that they gain synergy yet,
but just hopes asap,

77
00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.740
then they come to a country that is prepared to give him opportunities in to go

78
00:04:52.741 --> 00:04:54.650
for the goals and dreams that they wished to aspire.

79
00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.580
<v 2>That's like America first.
It's like we start with the individual.</v>

80
00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.270
So is your life more important than my life and my world?

81
00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.440
My life is more important than your life and I do my best to take care of
myself.

82
00:05:07.441 --> 00:05:10.410
I fill my cup up so that I can fill up your cup.

83
00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:18.640
<v 0>That was first for me is community.
I don't stand behind any country.</v>

84
00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.750
I can't say that.
I think Dominican Republic comes first.
I don't.

85
00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:27.550
I think it's people come first.
America first is such a dangerous concept.

86
00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:28.570
I don't know if you realize,

87
00:05:28.571 --> 00:05:33.220
but that's the reason why we're called the world is constantly at war America

88
00:05:33.221 --> 00:05:34.900
first is about white Americans first.

89
00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.070
It's white America first versus the few people from all around different

90
00:05:39.071 --> 00:05:39.581
countries,

91
00:05:39.581 --> 00:05:43.480
different colors who are okay with white America first because they're going to

92
00:05:43.481 --> 00:05:44.260
get the seconds.

93
00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.830
And there's always the temptation for me to align myself in that place and say

94
00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.090
if I just keep my head down a little bit,
then I will be next in line to cause.

95
00:05:52.091 --> 00:05:52.541
Guess what?

96
00:05:52.541 --> 00:05:56.350
I am more privileged then undocumented immigrants who come from Latin America

97
00:05:56.351 --> 00:05:57.440
who have crossed the border.

98
00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.330
And that is shameful to me and I have to every day train myself to put that

99
00:06:02.331 --> 00:06:06.350
thought down because I want to align myself with people.
And I know you said,

100
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.200
how can I think about another family when my own family is hurting?

101
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.400
But why wasn't America thinking about that when it came into the Dominican

102
00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:18.400
Republic when it created an incredibly uneven trading deals with Mexico when it

103
00:06:18.411 --> 00:06:22.640
bombed the hell out of my country,
right.
It wasn't that for America first.

104
00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:23.780
Isn't that why I'm here?

105
00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.090
Illegal immigration hurts legal immigration.

106
00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:33.923
<v 1>Okay.</v>

107
00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:39.360
<v 3>It's like you're waiting in line to get into this,
this place and for you to,</v>

108
00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.680
you know,
go to the back of the line,

109
00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:45.010
stand in line and wait and to watch people cut in line in front of you.

110
00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.840
It's a big fuck you to my family.
It's a big fuck you to the whole system.

111
00:06:49.841 --> 00:06:53.050
It's a whole,
it's not a battle wall.
Fuck the wall.

112
00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.350
It's about principles that you said.
It's based on principles.
If we waited,

113
00:06:56.351 --> 00:06:58.030
there would be no need for a wall in general.

114
00:06:58.031 --> 00:07:00.850
When you come here illegally and you got cut off,

115
00:07:00.851 --> 00:07:03.090
now you're in a position of being like in the middle class or even in a

116
00:07:03.091 --> 00:07:08.091
worldclass where now you're paying more taxes for someone to not pay taxes and

117
00:07:08.291 --> 00:07:09.970
now you're paying for their education and they was good.

118
00:07:09.971 --> 00:07:10.810
That could go on for your children.

119
00:07:10.811 --> 00:07:13.690
That could have gone for American citizens and now we're giving it to them.

120
00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:21.320
<v 0>Cause we had a process for a green card in place and guess what?</v>

121
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:26.270
We waited those two years and what happened was we were denied because they said

122
00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:30.470
your parents aren't making enough money.
That happened two more times.

123
00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:33.980
Every time we were denied,
my parents decided to stay because our entire lives,

124
00:07:33.981 --> 00:07:37.010
we're here,
our entire community,
our church community,
our friends.

125
00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:42.110
When you say there is a right way to immigrate here and there is an illegal way

126
00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.840
and you use a big fat label on all of that,

127
00:07:44.841 --> 00:07:49.010
you're really obscuring all these diverse details about people's lives.

128
00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:50.241
<v 4>It's a,</v>

129
00:07:50.241 --> 00:07:55.241
it's a really dangerous rhetoric when you begin to put good versus bad legal

130
00:07:57.381 --> 00:08:01.940
versus illegal.
Listen,
I crossed into this country.

131
00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:05.960
I migrated,
I walked with my brothers and my mother.

132
00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.440
I was a poor kid who had no shoes.

133
00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:14.930
How could I know that there was a legal process and when I came into this

134
00:08:14.931 --> 00:08:19.931
country I absolutely found out what it was to be entering into that legal

135
00:08:20.031 --> 00:08:23.660
process.
I'm in that process,
not 11 years and counting.

136
00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:28.160
So what you're doing is instead of looking up to the systems that are putting

137
00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:30.140
all of this situations and to place,

138
00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:33.680
you are looking down to the people most downtrodden.

139
00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:35.990
We did nothing to deserve this.

140
00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:40.040
It is actually the systems that are at play that you have to look and reflect

141
00:08:40.041 --> 00:08:42.590
and say,
why is this happening to your family?

142
00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:47.690
Why is it that your people about why people those same five two there are

143
00:08:47.691 --> 00:08:48.524
government,

144
00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:53.530
why the one of fly and demand America and that is insulting why that is why you

145
00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:58.750
guys victimize yourself.
There is no victimization.
Mine,

146
00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:02.210
how dare you say that?

147
00:09:02.211 --> 00:09:07.211
There was a victimization between my mother making a very real strategic

148
00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:09.920
decision and logical to say,

149
00:09:09.921 --> 00:09:14.000
I am going to read your night and my kids together to live under one roof.

150
00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:18.530
<v 2>Everyone have their own story and I'm fine with this but now we're talking about</v>

151
00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:23.330
the thousand of people trying to jump our territory.

152
00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:27.880
Language is important.
Language is important.
How you discuss the people who are,

153
00:09:27.881 --> 00:09:30.800
I mean I'm too tired to feel like,

154
00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:33.540
oh I cannot say this because they're going to get offended.

155
00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:38.950
I'm offended because I'm an American because I'm following the law.

156
00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:43.460
I'm offended because I'm a Christian woman because I'm a woman.

157
00:09:43.461 --> 00:09:46.130
Would principle with model with fate.

158
00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:50.210
<v 0>Something that's very interesting to me is one religion comes into place,</v>

159
00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:53.960
right and we say,
I am an American,
I am a Christian.

160
00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:58.990
Yet you are unable to put aside the political and look at a human being and say

161
00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:07.090
you deserve to be under one roof with the people that you love regardless of

162
00:10:07.851 --> 00:10:10.070
what the government decides to call you.

163
00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:13.430
But does that give you right to break into my house?
Exactly.

164
00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:17.450
Just break into his house.
Yeah.

165
00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:21.020
Look whose house,
whose house.

166
00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:26.860
The next statement is becoming a legal citizen should be easier.

167
00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:36.180
<v 4>If you look at the way that the government issues visas,</v>

168
00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:41.370
it's an a completely political system.
Who gets it?
What time,
how many years?

169
00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:43.110
And so when you think about citizenship,

170
00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:47.150
it absolutely should be easier in the legal process,
but let's not lose sight.

171
00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:51.450
The citizenship also means the way that you move about in your values and say,

172
00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:55.680
I can be a citizen of this country because I am a human being

173
00:10:55.820 --> 00:11:00.260
<v 0>and I think we have to recognize that undocumented immigrants don't want to be</v>

174
00:11:00.261 --> 00:11:04.610
undocumented.
If we were up to undocumented immigrant,
they will go show up,

175
00:11:04.611 --> 00:11:07.670
apply for a green card and then apply for citizenship and that's it.

176
00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:12.590
The system is currently failing because we are not appointing people who are

177
00:11:12.591 --> 00:11:16.100
able to understand why people are coming,

178
00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:20.570
people who are able to connect with the different stories that people are

179
00:11:20.571 --> 00:11:24.500
bringing forth,
but the problem is we need all to agree,

180
00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:27.170
but Ebay legal or illegal

181
00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:32.290
<v 2>emigration me to be control because you can see what is happening here in</v>

182
00:11:32.871 --> 00:11:37.120
California we see our street looking like a third one.

183
00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:39.210
<v 0>W I w I would respect that.</v>

184
00:11:39.211 --> 00:11:44.211
I would respect that opinion if I didn't know that more people were leaving the

185
00:11:45.451 --> 00:11:50.100
u s then coming in that undocumented immigrants are not the one predominantly

186
00:11:50.101 --> 00:11:51.720
committing crimes in this country.

187
00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:57.050
You see that people are more likely to leave now then come in here.

188
00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:59.630
<v 2>Let me tell you this.
I'm sorry to disagree.</v>

189
00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:03.050
When people are complaining about gun,
they say,
oh,

190
00:12:03.051 --> 00:12:06.590
we need gun control because even one life matter,

191
00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:08.330
well the same thing.

192
00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:12.590
Even if they do commend people having committed a crime,

193
00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:15.710
even one life matters.
Let me tell you this.

194
00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:20.920
I have a sister who become a widow at the age of 34 with two little boy because

195
00:12:21.921 --> 00:12:26.710
her husband got killed for that illegal alien.
Um,

196
00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:29.330
my brother in law lives matter.

197
00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:36.970
The Wall for me is a message of low from our precedent to his people because he

198
00:12:39.531 --> 00:12:43.190
went to protect the people from this side of the wall.

199
00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:48.300
Even you guys,
you want to protect everyone from this day,

200
00:12:48.301 --> 00:12:52.010
so the wall,
but we need to understand Hamas first.

201
00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:57.100
How can I help someone far away if I know able to help the people who is close

202
00:12:59.691 --> 00:13:00.524
to me?

203
00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:05.720
<v 0>The reason why I am so against the wall,
number one,
economically very infeasible.</v>

204
00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:06.800
And number two,

205
00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:10.160
I don't see the wall as being a physical barrier between two countries.

206
00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:13.520
I see it as a very symbolic barrier between people.

207
00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:18.320
People who are running for their lives are still going to come cause trust me,

208
00:13:18.321 --> 00:13:23.321
your desire to live is going to help you find a way to get over some wall.

209
00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:27.590
You know,
that's,
that's not the problem.
Walls,
barricades,

210
00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:32.650
barriers are not the economic moral answer.

211
00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:38.750
<v 3>Everyone in this room can make America great by finding solutions rather than</v>

212
00:13:38.751 --> 00:13:41.120
finding problems.
That's a lot of people like to do.

213
00:13:41.121 --> 00:13:43.910
We'd like to point out what's wrong and not trying to figure out what we can do

214
00:13:43.911 --> 00:13:46.700
to make it better.
Or we all agree that the immigration system sucks.

215
00:13:46.701 --> 00:13:50.390
Like you do what again,
like you were into the field of,
I'm a Paralegal,

216
00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:53.950
but I've been in Libra representative.
Okay.
And so you know more about an idea,

217
00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:56.960
I don't know,
compared to you.
So I want to hear you more your perspective,

218
00:13:56.961 --> 00:14:00.110
and I'm open to that.
That's what American needs more of.
You have something,

219
00:14:00.111 --> 00:14:01.880
I don't,
your superior in that field.

220
00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:07.270
And if we look at intellect before skin tone or before politics,

221
00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:11.180
that would open up more doors to make America great or make America even better.

222
00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:13.560
It's people who are in this country who want to fight for the betterment of it

223
00:14:13.561 --> 00:14:17.510
is what's making this country great.
I'm kidding.

224
00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:23.340
<v 5>I appreciate it.
I have so many firsts that I really appreciate it.
Yeah.</v>

225
00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:37.570
Okay.
