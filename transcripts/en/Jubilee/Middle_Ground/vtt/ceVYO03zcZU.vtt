00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.530
There was a woman who said her husband on fire killed him for raping her seven

2
00:00:04.531 --> 00:00:06.390
year old daughter.
She found him murder at him

3
00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:07.760
<v 1>and yes,
he deserves death penalty.</v>

4
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.113
<v 2>Nope.</v>

5
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.970
<v 3>If you support the death penalty,
please take the lights at the left.</v>

6
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.630
If you do not support the death penalty,
take the light to the right.

7
00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:34.663
<v 2>Okay.</v>

8
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.520
<v 3>First statement,
step forward.
If you agree,
if you do not agree,</v>

9
00:00:46.521 --> 00:00:48.640
if it is not true for you,
stay exactly where you are.

10
00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.530
Having a death penalty deters people from committing crimes.

11
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.230
<v 0>I don't know that any regular human,</v>

12
00:01:13.231 --> 00:01:15.630
the average human,
which is who we're speaking about,

13
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.930
would risk their life when,

14
00:01:18.931 --> 00:01:22.830
when that survival instinct is so incredibly ingrained and so strong,

15
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.170
<v 1>that's the foundation of my entire argument.</v>

16
00:01:25.171 --> 00:01:27.660
The reason why I stay on the left hand side,

17
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.890
not because I feel that capital punishment should be Honda [inaudible] to

18
00:01:31.891 --> 00:01:36.300
everyone that commits a crime.
No,
I'm talking about the idea that I,
my opinion,

19
00:01:36.301 --> 00:01:40.110
capital punishment as a deterrent.
It influences the way people behave.

20
00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.640
Look at Michigan,
Michigan abolished capital punishment,
1858 exactly.

21
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.700
Look at the crime rate Msq Retina.
Ridiculous.

22
00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.610
<v 0>So let me ask you guys,
your child grabs a vase purposely.</v>

23
00:01:51.611 --> 00:01:53.980
You see them grab the vase,
smash it on the ground,
look,

24
00:01:53.981 --> 00:01:55.930
you dead in the eye or they just everything my punishment.

25
00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:01.050
<v 1>Yes,
of course.
If are they aware of their actions?
They're four years old.</v>

26
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.610
Exactly.
They looked you right.
Exactly.
So I know what they did.

27
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.110
They know what they're doing wrong.
They know what they're doing wrong.

28
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.420
It's like a challenge.
You know,

29
00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.190
they're going to continue to do the same thing over and over and they're going
to

30
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.620
<v 0>punishing that child.
You spoke to that child.</v>

31
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.810
People though might not have all the information in the way that a four year old

32
00:02:18.811 --> 00:02:19.980
doesn't have all the information

33
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.033
<v 2>disagree with.</v>

34
00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.870
<v 4>I really don't remember.
Anytime someone was like,
you know,</v>

35
00:02:29.871 --> 00:02:34.480
I'm really want to kill someone,
but that death penalty man,
oh no,

36
00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.920
it just doesn't make sense to me that that's an deterrent.
Um,
if anything,
uh,

37
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.390
a human connection to someone like to themselves or their family or someone they

38
00:02:41.391 --> 00:02:44.110
care about has been the biggest deterrent in my idea.
Of course

39
00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.640
<v 3>anyone can be rehabilitated back into society.</v>

40
00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.690
<v 4>Absolutely.
Absolutely.
Here's the thing.
Here's the thing.</v>

41
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.080
I think this is probably the most hippie part about my whole thinking is that

42
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.040
that unending optimism for people that I know better than to give up on someone.

43
00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:13.553
<v 2>Okay.</v>

44
00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.440
<v 0>I agreed with the first half of the sentence,
but not the second,</v>

45
00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:20.110
and then I think anybody can be rehabilitated.

46
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.420
That doesn't mean that they're going back into society.

47
00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.030
There are options for somebody to live a full,

48
00:03:25.031 --> 00:03:29.410
complete life and not be a danger to society.

49
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.200
<v 5>You also have to look at it with child molestation cases.
I mean,</v>

50
00:03:32.201 --> 00:03:35.470
how are you going to send someone that did the crime like that and so heinous

51
00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.830
and it's happened many times where they released his people constantly and

52
00:03:38.831 --> 00:03:39.670
they're still doing the same.

53
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.760
<v 6>No matter how much you try to rebill it,
rehabilitate someone,</v>

54
00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.110
they also have to want to be rehabilitated in order to,
in order for it.

55
00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.770
<v 4>That's the thing we're assuming people don't want to be rehabilitated.</v>

56
00:03:50.771 --> 00:03:54.010
That's my whole point is that if you can believe some people don't want to be

57
00:03:54.011 --> 00:03:55.000
rehabilitated though,

58
00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.340
then you'd have to also believe the possibility that they could redeem

59
00:03:57.341 --> 00:03:59.920
themselves and do something amazing after that rehabilitation happened.

60
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.360
<v 0>For those people that that are just like past rehabilitation or they are</v>

61
00:04:04.361 --> 00:04:06.550
deserving of death,
is that what we've come to?

62
00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.580
<v 6>It really,
it really depends on,
again,
circumstances,
the circumstances,</v>

63
00:04:11.581 --> 00:04:12.570
of course,
this crime,

64
00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.140
<v 4>that's where we're getting to like where are we to stay,
who's deserving or not.</v>

65
00:04:16.141 --> 00:04:19.110
We need to actually know their entire store and who they are as a person,

66
00:04:19.111 --> 00:04:22.170
their upbringing,
what got them into that situation,
their mental stability.

67
00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.180
All of those things can be taken more into consideration,

68
00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.620
<v 0>but that goes to say that once you read their book that you're going to be</v>

69
00:04:26.621 --> 00:04:28.420
empathetic and it's clear that they've taken

70
00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.860
<v 5>no,
when families have lost and kids do too</v>

71
00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:38.080
<v 4>tire most important time to have empathy.
Yes.</v>

72
00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.750
That's the whole point is when families have gone through that to understand

73
00:04:41.751 --> 00:04:44.410
what the family's going through on top of what the person went through it.

74
00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.470
<v 2>Okay.</v>

75
00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.630
<v 5>Everyone deserves a second chance.</v>

76
00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.830
Personally,
I,
you know,
I don't,
I don't think everybody deserves a second chance,

77
00:04:59.831 --> 00:05:03.130
but I do believe that there are people who do deserve it.
So it just depends.

78
00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:04.360
Again,
like I was mentioning earlier,

79
00:05:04.361 --> 00:05:07.930
it depends on what kind of crime the committee,
if it's,
if they killed somebody,

80
00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.180
I don't believe that they deserve a second chance.

81
00:05:10.181 --> 00:05:12.310
But if they is like a lesser crime,

82
00:05:12.311 --> 00:05:13.750
like they're stealing something from the store,

83
00:05:13.751 --> 00:05:17.350
like candy or something like that or,
or a TV or a bike,

84
00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.630
I do believe that they deserve a second chance.

85
00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:20.431
<v 4>Here's the thing for me,</v>

86
00:05:20.431 --> 00:05:24.540
this is why it gets hypocritical to me in this kind of discussion where we all

87
00:05:24.541 --> 00:05:27.480
think about the other person of the victim or something like that in terms of

88
00:05:27.481 --> 00:05:30.550
second chances.
But the whole biggest idea we,

89
00:05:30.551 --> 00:05:33.510
we really confront this idea is if it was us,

90
00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:37.770
where would I want a second chance?
If I knew I messed up on something,

91
00:05:37.771 --> 00:05:40.590
however heinous or big it was,
or however small it was,

92
00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:45.300
I want that second chance for me.
And if for at least my family and friends,

93
00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.270
that's the least I want.
So that's why I know it applies to everyone.

94
00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:50.490
<v 0>I think it depends on what the second chance is.</v>

95
00:05:50.491 --> 00:05:53.890
That doesn't mean that there is absolute reentry into society.

96
00:05:53.891 --> 00:05:57.060
And a second chance often means giving someone their life.

97
00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:01.430
Just say a horrendous crime there.
I had someone raped in burns the one alive.

98
00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.710
It's a horrendous crime to just let them out of society.

99
00:06:03.711 --> 00:06:05.640
That's too much of a second chance.
But from what?

100
00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:10.710
Within the confines of prison for such a heinous act that you do get a little

101
00:06:11.421 --> 00:06:12.254
bit more.

102
00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:16.930
<v 1>Only one.
Yeah.
Um,
just want to go back to statement.</v>

103
00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:19.870
Um,
people deserve chances.
Um,

104
00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.350
does every single person deserves a second chance?
In my opinion,
no.

105
00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:26.380
Because maybe what the crime that they committed then you're talking about.

106
00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:28.510
I would love to have the chance to have a second chance.

107
00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:32.080
There's a difference between I would love to have it and I deserve it.

108
00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:38.230
<v 0>I think I'm a little confused about where it is that this line is drawn because</v>

109
00:06:38.231 --> 00:06:41.740
that makes the difference between a second chance between life and death,

110
00:06:41.741 --> 00:06:44.080
between consideration and no consideration.
Yeah,

111
00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.980
<v 1>I think it,
I think it does start with Eh,</v>

112
00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:47.980
the obviously the crime that you commit.

113
00:06:47.981 --> 00:06:50.700
There's a difference between intentionally an annotation.

114
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:53.840
<v 0>Okay.
So if I put a pillow over a woman's face versus if I chuck her up,</v>

115
00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:55.493
<v 6>you're still</v>

116
00:06:58.440 --> 00:06:59.680
<v 0>life.
That is the height of</v>

117
00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.290
<v 1>premed.
If it was calculated,
I don't think you deserve a second chance.</v>

118
00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:06.310
And in my opinion for a crime like that.
No,
I don't care.
I'm newer Morris.

119
00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:07.880
I've no mercy for anyone he kills.
I know.

120
00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:10.710
<v 0>Okay.
There was,
um,
I spoke about this the other day.</v>

121
00:07:10.711 --> 00:07:15.210
There was a woman who said her husband on fire killed him for raping her seven

122
00:07:15.211 --> 00:07:18.810
year old daughter.
She found him murdered him.
That was not self defense.

123
00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:20.340
It was premeditated.

124
00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:24.970
<v 6>Yes.
And yes,
she deserves the and yesterday deserves death penalty.
It is.</v>

125
00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:28.900
She can listen.
She,
she can go through the legal pro.

126
00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:33.330
I don't care how much it hurts you.
I understand that.
I understand it.

127
00:07:33.331 --> 00:07:37.560
But you still need to go through the legal process like everybody else.

128
00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:41.000
You don't take it into your own hands to go and to go in.
Yeah.

129
00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:44.260
<v 0>I don't see like it's global justice,
like you're doing something for the world,</v>

130
00:07:44.261 --> 00:07:45.580
like you are moving a threat,

131
00:07:45.581 --> 00:07:48.940
but that woman was doing some global justice if I ever heard it.

132
00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:52.240
<v 6>That was not her right to do though.
It,
that's not how it works.</v>

133
00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:56.640
<v 0>A jury of your peers that we as citizens,
we as the constituency,</v>

134
00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:00.570
we have that right then what?
Because we have numbers because we have

135
00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:05.980
<v 6>penalty is a state a state sanctioned homicide.
It's still,</v>

136
00:08:05.981 --> 00:08:10.150
it still is a homicide,
but it is decided by multiple people at that point.

137
00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:13.930
<v 4>I think we need to go above the legal system in this dialogue because it was</v>

138
00:08:13.931 --> 00:08:14.764
legal to have.

139
00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:20.230
<v 6>Yeah,
exactly.
Right.
We have to go beyond this and that was awesome.</v>

140
00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:22.160
<v 1>Then what we're talking about.</v>

141
00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:26.570
If someone genuinely apologizes for a crime,

142
00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:28.940
their punishment should be reduced.

143
00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:38.023
<v 2>MMM.</v>

144
00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:45.780
<v 4>Um,
the thing is like,
of course,
it's the hardest part of this concept.</v>

145
00:08:45.781 --> 00:08:50.781
This idea is how do you judge someone's genuine authenticity and in their

146
00:08:50.791 --> 00:08:55.680
apologetic ness,
right?
I specifically remember a case,
uh,
Stanley Williams,

147
00:08:55.681 --> 00:09:00.570
this guy,
I'm really convinced me that he was apologetic for his crime.

148
00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:03.180
And the thing was he believed he didn't commit the crime.

149
00:09:03.181 --> 00:09:04.320
He was innocent of the crime,

150
00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:08.760
but he was still apologetic for his past crimes that he had done in his life and

151
00:09:08.761 --> 00:09:11.880
the things that he did get convicted for.
So,
um,

152
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:15.870
when I saw that he'd made a children's book about preventing other kids from

153
00:09:15.871 --> 00:09:20.100
actually ending up where he ended up as a gang member and leader of the crips,

154
00:09:20.101 --> 00:09:21.310
I believe,
um,

155
00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.420
that was enough for me where he's actually going out of his way to prevent

156
00:09:24.421 --> 00:09:26.610
future crime from happening for other people.
I'm like,
all right,

157
00:09:26.611 --> 00:09:29.250
I accept your apology,
man.
I,
except that big time,

158
00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:32.403
<v 2>man.</v>

159
00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:36.520
<v 5>There's no way of validating apology.
I mean like,</v>

160
00:09:36.521 --> 00:09:40.100
how do you know if they're apologizing?
They're lying.
You know,
that was a lot.

161
00:09:40.101 --> 00:09:43.370
I mean,
there are people who seem so genuine and Yup.
Behind,
you know,

162
00:09:43.371 --> 00:09:44.204
behind their eyes.
Yeah.

163
00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:48.540
<v 4>Are you doing not useful?
Let's just say a gang on gang violence.
Just a dad,</v>

164
00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:53.990
a gang member did a hit on a house of a leading gate opposing gang member in

165
00:09:54.881 --> 00:09:57.660
their family and kids just say,
well,
shooting,
he killed three people.

166
00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:01.440
Just say eventually he did apologize.
It doesn't matter.

167
00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:05.400
He's still killed someone and he should still serve a life sentence for that.

168
00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:09.450
What if this person did so much to redeem themselves or account for that and

169
00:10:09.451 --> 00:10:12.090
actually show their genuine apologetic that's behind it?

170
00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:16.070
I do not set the whole thing.
I don't care.
Is that debate?
They committed murder.

171
00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.620
They get,
they get like in prison,
no death penalty.

172
00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:21.870
They get white and so they became Mother Teresa after this.
Nope.
No,

173
00:10:21.871 --> 00:10:25.080
I've been president.
They get naked to see their life behind bars.

174
00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:27.600
<v 0>One thing it's important to consider the,</v>

175
00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:29.840
the dues stress that this gentleman is under.

176
00:10:29.841 --> 00:10:34.430
He's in a gang lifestyle and a gang environment where he's gonna get his ass

177
00:10:34.431 --> 00:10:38.920
beat if he does not go make this hit.
Even in military crimes.
Yup.

178
00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:42.170
Like in World War Two all of those people that followed orders,
yes,

179
00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.930
they were guilty of those crimes.
There are people who will post.

180
00:10:44.931 --> 00:10:48.350
There are people who try to,
within Hitler's own group,
tried to kill Hitler.

181
00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:51.740
You still at the individual chose to do an action.

182
00:10:51.741 --> 00:10:54.770
You can't count on somebody else to have courage and the capacity that you do.

183
00:10:54.771 --> 00:10:57.680
You can't count on somebody to be as intelligent or as brave as you are.

184
00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:00.300
<v 5>If we,
if we just allow someone just to skirt by like that,</v>

185
00:11:00.301 --> 00:11:03.030
we're giving a bad example to everybody else in society and they're going to

186
00:11:03.031 --> 00:11:05.220
think that they could just repeat the same thing and they're going to get over.

187
00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:06.073
<v 4>Wait,
what's that?</v>

188
00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:12.460
I believe that anyone can forgive anyone given enough time.

189
00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:21.820
I just want to sit on that side.
I can do that.
Yes.
So right here,

190
00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:26.520
this time,
I mean,

191
00:11:26.521 --> 00:11:30.630
once I wrote a story about a mother that forgave the killer of our child,

192
00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:35.340
I'm like,
okay,
okay.
I believe in it.
I believe anything is possible.
Now,

193
00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:39.240
uh,
imagine your mother for a second.
Right?

194
00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:40.790
<v 2>Okay.</v>

195
00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:45.350
<v 4>If someone were to kill your mother,
would you be able to forgive that person?</v>

196
00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:48.843
<v 2>No.</v>

197
00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:54.000
<v 4>Eventually.
Eventually it'd hard question was with</v>

198
00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:58.530
<v 1>time.
Anyone could.
I'm going to say,
I'm going to say yes with the shirt.</v>

199
00:11:58.540 --> 00:11:59.373
With time,

200
00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:02.190
<v 5>unless you've really experienced something like that,</v>

201
00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:05.520
you won't know yourself really.
You,
you only know what you feel right now.

202
00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:10.320
But unless you were in that motion where it did happen,
that,
that,
that mentality,

203
00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:13.670
<v 4>you don't,
you don't know where to traumatize people with that question.</v>

204
00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:18.340
<v 1>Oh,
hello.
First of all,
guys,
for asking a question about your mother.</v>

205
00:12:18.341 --> 00:12:23.020
I applaud you for even giving consideration to forgive that person and for

206
00:12:23.021 --> 00:12:26.170
myself personally.
Um,
if someone like that that happened,
my mom,

207
00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:30.760
I was fighting so hard for myself to forgive that person who committed that act,

208
00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:36.130
knowing that he has destroyed my life,
Alice's destroy our family's lives,

209
00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:38.520
<v 5>I think I would eventually forgive.</v>

210
00:12:38.521 --> 00:12:40.740
But I know there's people out there who would always hold a grudge.

211
00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:44.040
I think justify someone killing my mother.
I mean,
I can't,
I don't,

212
00:12:44.041 --> 00:12:45.840
I can't see myself forgiving someone like that

213
00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:47.210
<v 4>hurting.</v>

214
00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:51.030
Great concept about it immediately for giving someone and finding the reasons to

215
00:12:51.031 --> 00:12:52.610
forgive them later like that.

216
00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:56.460
That actually helped me find peace of mind knowing that that's the guaranteed

217
00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:58.620
like where I should end up anyway.
You know?

218
00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:03.290
<v 1>So back to this concept of our own mothers.</v>

219
00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:05.110
<v 2>Okay.</v>

220
00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:07.480
<v 1>If my mother were to commit murder,</v>

221
00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:10.030
I would vouch for her to receive capital punishment.

222
00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:14.733
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

223
00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.900
<v 5>I,
I,
I can't,
you know,
I can't sit here and be a hypocrite.
Oh.
And say,</v>

224
00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:29.670
and I'm for capital punishment,

225
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.990
if my own mother would to commit a crime is so heinous.
Yeah.

226
00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:34.560
I would before even for her,

227
00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:38.790
<v 1>the law,
the law,
the lies to everybody.
One,
even my own mother.
Yeah.</v>

228
00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:41.400
If law enforcement abides by how still by,

229
00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:44.640
by the laws of US citizens have to buy below.
Yeah.
Mom said too,

230
00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:53.900
<v 4>this is a very troubling thing for me that anybody walked up to these chairs</v>

231
00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:55.160
because one,

232
00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:59.510
it's something that I questioned morally and emotionally about our society that

233
00:13:59.511 --> 00:14:03.710
we're not already crying or feeling some kind of feeling about our own mother

234
00:14:03.711 --> 00:14:08.480
being on death row because now we can easily imagine if we take it one more step

235
00:14:08.481 --> 00:14:09.230
further,

236
00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:13.280
that every single person on death row is somebody's mother or father or sister

237
00:14:13.281 --> 00:14:14.114
or brother.

238
00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.120
<v 5>We we can't escape.
That will be sad,
but at the same time,</v>

239
00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:19.640
they committed a crime and they have to pay for it.

240
00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:24.300
That's it for the death penalty though.
Why it had to be the jet it,

241
00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:28.160
why would I be for the most to me in the first place on other crimes,

242
00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:29.151
sex offenders,

243
00:14:29.151 --> 00:14:32.180
what would it be for and what if there were a sex offender themselves that

244
00:14:32.181 --> 00:14:33.950
doesn't exclude them or my parents?
Yeah.

245
00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:39.890
<v 1>I am afraid that there are innocent people on death row.</v>

246
00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:50.920
I think we can all agree.
Yup.
Yeah.

247
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:56.120
<v 4>There's no denying that fuck is in the current could be more to or to be more</v>

248
00:14:56.121 --> 00:14:57.200
people.
The current count,

249
00:14:57.201 --> 00:15:01.940
I believe ever since up President Carter is a hundred people have been found not

250
00:15:01.941 --> 00:15:06.470
guilty due to basically witnesses lying DNA and are such things.

251
00:15:06.471 --> 00:15:10.610
So a hundred people is not a small amount.

252
00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:14.540
If one person is innocent,
that's enough for me to not trust the legal system.
Um,

253
00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:17.030
and on top of that,
in terms of corruption,
racism,

254
00:15:17.031 --> 00:15:19.550
all these kinds of things that affect our whole legal system,

255
00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:21.590
I don't know why it's taboo to say that like,
yeah,

256
00:15:21.591 --> 00:15:23.540
we need to admit that more and it's going to be okay.

257
00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:26.440
Like let's admit it and move forward.
Can I get hugs?

258
00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:32.510
She's good.
She's good.
How's your mom doing?

259
00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:38.190
Okay,
good job guys.
