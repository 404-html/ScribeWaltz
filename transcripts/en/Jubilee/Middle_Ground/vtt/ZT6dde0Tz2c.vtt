1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.300
Kids
killing kids.

2
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.330
It's not fun and so desensitizes what we have to do because that is hard

3
00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:09.790
<v 1>job.
It's a job.</v>

4
00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:22.413
<v 2>Okay,</v>

5
00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:33.030
excellent.
The other wall this size,

6
00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.190
<v 0>the notes here,
brainwashing was it sold?</v>

7
00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:00.063
<v 2>Oh Wow.</v>

8
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.760
<v 3>Um,</v>

9
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.760
I don't think the natural inclination for a human being is to want to kill

10
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.150
another human being.

11
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.710
There is a necessary requirement in the military to get you to perform a certain

12
00:01:12.711 --> 00:01:15.110
action and in order for that action to occur,

13
00:01:15.111 --> 00:01:20.111
it is my theory that there is a part of changing the way that you think in order

14
00:01:21.001 --> 00:01:24.620
to take somebody from a human being and make it a target so that you can achieve

15
00:01:24.621 --> 00:01:25.454
a goal.

16
00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.883
<v 2>Everybody else,
come on.</v>

17
00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.610
<v 0>Faye had asked our,
our,
the military,
um,</v>

18
00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.250
desensitizing soldiers,

19
00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.810
are they manipulating them mentally?

20
00:01:40.811 --> 00:01:44.780
And I would have walked over here.
I would have walked over here to brainwashing.

21
00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:45.750
Has It?

22
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.220
<v 3>Well,
I dunno man.
It's just like,</v>

23
00:01:47.221 --> 00:01:51.390
I even watch like the advertisements for the military and it just seems to me

24
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.140
<v 0>the one thing you brought up was,
was killing.
Um,
it's,
no,</v>

25
00:01:56.141 --> 00:01:57.900
no one wants to do it.
I know.
I don't want to do it.

26
00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:02.210
I know I didn't want to flip too.
If you have used the words desensitize,

27
00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.710
we're desensitizing yourself because we have to.
We have to move on.

28
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.840
And just think that,
that's kind of my point though,

29
00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.980
in order to get from that spot where you don't want to kill another human being

30
00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.750
to where you look at it as,
this is just my job,
but it's a choice.

31
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.900
It's not brainwashed and really just comes down to it.

32
00:02:18.901 --> 00:02:21.710
And that guy at the end of your muscle or you.
Right.

33
00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.170
And I want to come back home to my family

34
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.130
<v 2>war is a necessary,
are you?</v>

35
00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.000
<v 1>Ah,
okay.
This is a tough one.</v>

36
00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.010
I think that there's a point between a just war and an unjust war.

37
00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.460
There are certain wars that um,
you know,

38
00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.580
maybe we should have gone into like maybe we shouldn't have gone an entire rack.

39
00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.170
Right,
right.
And then there are certain wars were world war two,

40
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.010
you know,
where Hitler was advancing to Poland.

41
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.560
I think that's definitely a just war to get into.

42
00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.140
<v 3>And then he was trying to kill Jewish people.
Yeah.
And then that case,</v>

43
00:03:09.141 --> 00:03:13.400
you could call it a necessary evil or is it a time that that necessary evil has

44
00:03:13.401 --> 00:03:16.850
to happen?
And in that you don't even maybe call it a necessary evil,

45
00:03:16.851 --> 00:03:20.420
it's just a necessity.
The action itself has to take place.

46
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.003
<v 2>Hmm.</v>

47
00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.010
<v 1>As long as we leave this on the table at war's a necessary evil,</v>

48
00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.570
it really just excuses.
Almost all,
uh,
you know,
all wars.
Because if it's six,

49
00:03:32.571 --> 00:03:35.540
the what's excusable,
right.
When does it become necessary?

50
00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.850
If you really want to see what a peaceful world,

51
00:03:37.851 --> 00:03:41.270
you have to just get rid of that cause they'll keyword there's is a necessary

52
00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:42.740
necessary,
but I don't believe that.

53
00:03:42.741 --> 00:03:47.600
I'm believe it's necessary that it's the only way for you to obtain your

54
00:03:47.601 --> 00:03:52.250
objective is war.
That's the reason why I thought you were disagreeing with evil.

55
00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:57.200
No,
no,
no,
no.
I mean,
well,
yeah,
war is not evil.
I mean,
uh,

56
00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.640
yeah,
it's,
it's not.
Um,
have you ever had an argument,

57
00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.560
but you had good intentions course,
right?
So to speak on the word evil.

58
00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.190
I don't really agree that war equals evil as well.

59
00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.410
<v 3>World peace is possible.</v>

60
00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:15.263
<v 2>Oh,
sure.</v>

61
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:22.620
<v 3>Probable.
Maybe not possible.
Yes.
Yeah.</v>

62
00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.420
When you get humans together and find a way to find common ground to find the

63
00:04:27.421 --> 00:04:29.790
similarities rather than the differences,

64
00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.570
that's when you have a possibility at peace.

65
00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.800
Now I believe that it is something that is possible on a grand scale.

66
00:04:37.801 --> 00:04:41.430
Is it easy?
Maybe not,
but it is possible

67
00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.730
<v 4>world peace.
I want that to happen of course,</v>

68
00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:52.430
but it's so much easier said than done I think because just the way that we were

69
00:04:52.431 --> 00:04:55.870
taught,
you know we all want world peace,
but let's say

70
00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.210
<v 1>where in Africa thinks that genital mutilation is perfectly fine?</v>

71
00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.160
Are we going to be perfectly fine with that?

72
00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:03.780
Are we going to be able to talk them out of it?

73
00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.900
I don't really think we are because they have their own customs,

74
00:05:06.901 --> 00:05:07.621
their own culture.

75
00:05:07.621 --> 00:05:12.210
So the only way we can kind of get them to accept our culture is through some

76
00:05:12.211 --> 00:05:16.440
sort of violence that's dangerous.
Yeah.
I do believe the,

77
00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.500
the quantum of people that would prefer piece to conflict is,

78
00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.500
is growing.
And that's what gives me hope.

79
00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:29.493
<v 2>Yeah,
of course.</v>

80
00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.180
<v 4>So if it meant if I die,
the world will be at peace.
Well,
yeah,</v>

81
00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:39.560
look,

82
00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.100
<v 3>I've,
I've had some amazing adventures on planet earth.</v>

83
00:05:43.101 --> 00:05:44.600
I've had the greatest of friends,

84
00:05:44.601 --> 00:05:48.440
the greatest of families seem the best concerts.
Uh,
seen some beautiful places.

85
00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:53.600
If it meant that that happened for this place to be a okay,
groovy.

86
00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:57.830
Do it right now.
I had a good run.
I got 35 years.
That's than a lot.

87
00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.820
<v 1>Uh,
I've got more than twice.
Yeah.
Those years.</v>

88
00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:07.130
But more importantly,
I have two grandchildren and a third one on the way.

89
00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.710
Yeah.
And really I had to think about it,

90
00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.770
but if I could do that and bring them world peace,

91
00:06:12.771 --> 00:06:17.760
let alone all the Lexi's and Charlie's around the world,
that's it.

92
00:06:17.761 --> 00:06:20.150
Easy.
And like life is so beautiful.
But for me,

93
00:06:20.151 --> 00:06:24.650
I believe there is a life after my life and there are many lifetimes.
Yeah.

94
00:06:24.651 --> 00:06:26.180
If I had to die for world peace,

95
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:32.380
me versus 7 billion human beings,
like it's not even a question.

96
00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:37.350
I initially,
when I heard the question,
I thought,
man,
what a dumb question.

97
00:06:37.351 --> 00:06:40.380
And then Steve,
your answer actually really made me think like,
Oh wow,

98
00:06:40.381 --> 00:06:42.870
actually elicited like a really beautiful response or you're talking about your

99
00:06:42.871 --> 00:06:45.770
grandchildren,
you know,
and then I heard something that I am like,
I'll,

100
00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.940
I'll think a little bit more about this question.
And I realized,

101
00:06:47.941 --> 00:06:51.900
you know what if I say I'm willing to die for a piece?
Oh Gosh,

102
00:06:51.901 --> 00:06:54.810
once the last time we did anything to actually promote peace,
so I'd be like,
wow,

103
00:06:54.811 --> 00:06:58.380
I'd be really full of shit if I said that I would be willing to die repeat
piece.

104
00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:02.430
I wouldn't be able to even take the most basic steps towards actually

105
00:07:02.431 --> 00:07:04.110
contributing something basic.

106
00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:06.540
<v 5>Those basic steps totally matter.
Um,</v>

107
00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:10.980
but also living a life of purpose is a life that's lived a moment to moment to

108
00:07:10.981 --> 00:07:15.660
moment.
So simply you,
by being you,
you affect people.
Like I,
I,

109
00:07:15.661 --> 00:07:18.870
you see my around,
I only met you for what,
half an hour,
45 minutes.

110
00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:22.170
You've got a good head on your shoulders and wherever you go,

111
00:07:22.171 --> 00:07:24.820
you leave an imprint.
And that's true for all of us.
Yeah.

112
00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:29.360
<v 1>I mean,
don't get me wrong,
I don't want to die.
And I'd rather do those things.</v>

113
00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:31.260
I,
I'm in a,

114
00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:36.370
I'm in a peace group that has met every Friday morning since nine 1116 years for

115
00:07:38.631 --> 00:07:42.830
two hours every Friday to work on these issues.

116
00:07:42.831 --> 00:07:45.290
So I think really if we,
oh,

117
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:48.980
I sometimes say a dollar a day and an hour a day,

118
00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:52.380
I know someone who has died.

119
00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:01.713
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

120
00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:07.920
<v 1>yeah,
I know a lot of,
I mean,
not like tons of people,
but as you know,</v>

121
00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:12.360
dozen or so people we've had dug,
my closest friend who kill a was killed was a,

122
00:08:12.361 --> 00:08:15.600
his name is Chris Domain and he had a wife and kids.
So it was a,

123
00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:17.340
it's a pretty sad,

124
00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:21.800
<v 0>I've deployed seven times now and I'm scheduled to go back out in March.
Oh,</v>

125
00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:23.750
for my eighth back to Afghanistan.
But,
uh,

126
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:28.070
I think there was probably one or two deployments where we didn't lose someone.

127
00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:30.590
Oh yeah.
I don't know if it's appropriate.

128
00:08:30.591 --> 00:08:35.591
What taps into your courage to keep going back and the face of losing these

129
00:08:36.651 --> 00:08:41.090
guys?
Yeah,
it's uh,
for me it's not only just a job.
When I say job,

130
00:08:41.091 --> 00:08:43.670
I think of family.
I think I'm putting food on the table,

131
00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:45.080
roof over the head of my family.

132
00:08:45.081 --> 00:08:49.040
And then second to that are pretty much tied for first is the guys next to you.

133
00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:49.341
You know,

134
00:08:49.341 --> 00:08:52.670
I went to high school out here in La and really didn't have a future in college

135
00:08:52.671 --> 00:08:55.890
or anything and just,
we grew up poor and homeless at some points,

136
00:08:55.891 --> 00:08:59.020
but I joined the military,
wanted to serve my country and really just,
uh,

137
00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:02.520
have some stable.
And as it evolved,
it was now it was like this big family,

138
00:09:02.521 --> 00:09:05.860
you're part of,
you're part of something that's bigger.
And I don't mind,
uh,

139
00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:07.740
deploying because I know I'm with family.

140
00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:14.020
<v 4>I think I'm blessed that I don't know anybody who's died in combat.
So I mean,</v>

141
00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:17.980
yeah,
I don't understand what you guys have been through,

142
00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:22.270
but I applaud you,
all of you guys for,
like you said,
putting food on the table.

143
00:09:22.271 --> 00:09:25.600
Because in my head I was like,
there's so many jobs up there.
Why this one?

144
00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:29.860
<v 1>When you're,
when you're a soldier,
you're,
you're making a sacrifice.</v>

145
00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:32.930
So thank you by the way.
You're welcome.

146
00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:36.070
<v 2>Yeah.
You know,
I mean,
I think</v>

147
00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:40.220
<v 1>as Americans,
we appreciate anybody who makes us significant sacrifice.</v>

148
00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:42.630
That was kind of the ultimate sacrifice.
Yeah,

149
00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:47.870
<v 2>yeah.
No kidding.
So this,
this,</v>

150
00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:53.650
this exceeded my expectations.
I appreciate it.

151
00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:59.730
That's pretty sure.
Yeah.
Okay.

152
00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:03.110

Much appreciation.
