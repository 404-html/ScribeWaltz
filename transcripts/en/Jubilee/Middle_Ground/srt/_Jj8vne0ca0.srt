1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,570
Because a, it's not your land
be, you mentioned Europe.

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:06,330
Well you can tell me that.
Please don't say that.

3
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:14,660
When it comes to the Israeli
Palestinian conflict,

4
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:17,630
I think I'm mostly emotionally sad.

5
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:26,450
I think it's not fair that you
know a country that is peaceful.

6
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:29,910
Being in a situation where
we have to be threatened.

7
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:35,130
Being an Arab girl,
living inside of the Israeli state,

8
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:40,050
it's pretty hard for me
to find exactly who I am.

9
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:45,370
What of the Palestinians who still live
under occupation. So we have no power.

10
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,260
I believe that every person,
Jew, Christian, Muslim,

11
00:00:50,261 --> 00:00:52,690
should be full equal citizens
under Israeli software.

12
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:58,280
We need just to end this
conflict between us.

13
00:00:58,281 --> 00:01:01,970
It's because we don't need the other
generations to live the life that we live

14
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:02,813
in.

15
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:10,420
Continue to do what we did until now.

16
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:14,620
It's probably going to stay and
we need to do something else.

17
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:32,770
My name's Hannah, Ziad. I'm 24 years
old and I'm an area being utuber.

18
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:34,620
My name is [inaudible].

19
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:38,350
I'm 25 years old and I'm
a Jewish Israeli Zionist.

20
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:42,400
My name is [inaudible].
I'm from netlists 25 years old.

21
00:01:42,401 --> 00:01:44,620
Studied public relations
and communications.

22
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:46,300
My name is [inaudible].

23
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:51,700
I'm from a small town called [inaudible]
right outside of Jerusalem and I'm 24

24
00:01:52,521 --> 00:01:53,354
years old.

25
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:57,520
My name is Arab domain, how many? 24
years old. And I'm from Jerusalem.

26
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,720
My name is Ron [inaudible].

27
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:04,130
I'm 34 years old and I work as a deputy
director of a think tank that deals with

28
00:02:04,131 --> 00:02:05,300
law and economics.

29
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:20,563
Firstly

30
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:25,623
because of this.

31
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:29,643
Okay.

32
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:35,760
Okay. My father was murdered
by two IDF soldiers.

33
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:39,600
Um, it hit us hard,
especially for my family.

34
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,720
We're only girls and and inside of
the Arabic nation that's really hard.

35
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,330
My friend when I was 10
years old is we get a sniper,

36
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,480
a should it her, uh, in her head.

37
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,570
So that was really hard for us.

38
00:02:55,450 --> 00:03:00,100
No, I grew up during the second
intifada, the carry a list with

39
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:00,933
me of

40
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:05,380
all my friends who were
murdered in terror attacks.

41
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:09,730
So I have a list of 27 people.

42
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:13,120
They were actually very close to me
in Israel. We have on Memorial Day.

43
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:16,870
So I have always a dilemma
which grave to go to.

44
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:18,750
The 16th of January,

45
00:03:18,751 --> 00:03:22,800
2007 Israeli soldier shutting
killed my sister there.

46
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:26,670
She was 10 years old,
front of Ferris called and I was 13.

47
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:30,820
We were six kids in the house.
After that way we can,

48
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:35,590
okay.

49
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:39,800
All of the people that I
know have lost someone, um,

50
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,280
to the warrant in some way.

51
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:48,060
And I think like grief is
such a universal emotion.

52
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,840
Like I'm, I really, I want to hog it.

53
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,350
I serve in the IDF.
I still serve in the army reserves combat.

54
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:02,980
I was very competent. The second
Intifada, and I feel your grief and I,

55
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,550
I understand it,
but I have to say that I've,

56
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,130
I never got an order to shoot someone.
Uh,

57
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:11,560
the origin was only to shoot if someone
is a threat to your life or a third to

58
00:04:11,561 --> 00:04:12,610
someone else's lives.

59
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:17,820
I also served in the IDF and they really
do just teach us to defend ourselves.

60
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:22,090
If we're not defending ourselves and
we do kill someone, we go to jail.

61
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,400
That's not true.
That's not true.

62
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:28,540
I can't tell you something.
The soldier that killed my sister,

63
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:31,390
he didn't spend one day in there.
Neither did my father,

64
00:04:31,391 --> 00:04:34,030
both of them that murder him
did not stay in one day in jail.

65
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,070
I haven't we a Tuesdays
pollution as possible.

66
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,770
Okay. I think that Tinian they will
not stop saying that. We we want,

67
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,590
we want a country.
So in the end,

68
00:04:55,591 --> 00:04:59,790
if we got to the point that we
have our state and they have,

69
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:01,920
they state so no problem.

70
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:04,650
Okay.

71
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:07,100
This is going to be better for
us to live all of us together,

72
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:09,110
which has no state like Palestinian,

73
00:05:09,111 --> 00:05:13,130
no state like Israeli only together and
having fits together like there is no

74
00:05:13,131 --> 00:05:17,060
walls and there is no checkpoints
which has happened right now

75
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:19,010
I'm with you. One state, Andrew,

76
00:05:19,011 --> 00:05:23,130
Israel's sovereignty and everyone's
full equal citizen. Alrighty. Okay.

77
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:27,070
But Andrew Israeli sovereignty because
right now I [inaudible] he's got a

78
00:05:27,071 --> 00:05:29,920
problem. Why should it be on one?
Why should one religion control?

79
00:05:29,921 --> 00:05:33,920
Why can't that region, it's a
nationality. It's my nationality. So if

80
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:40,090
Justinian the Palestinian, they control
it. You can't live under it. No,

81
00:05:40,091 --> 00:05:43,300
because it's not going to because hey,
it's not your land be,

82
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:46,960
you mentioned your slip.
You can tell me please.

83
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:52,270
100% that's then used to
meant one question. Yes.

84
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:57,220
These Ansari, you are a grand four
grand grandfather. You know where he is.

85
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:01,310
Yes. Winning is to give me how many, how
many grades do you want me to call? Seven.

86
00:06:01,311 --> 00:06:06,020
Three, four, seven. Before I knew it.
Yes. Seven before isn't hungry and hungry.

87
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,410
Nine before he isn't Palestine.
Don't tell me it's not more than that.

88
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:11,990
I'm saying it's not your land.

89
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:15,490
It's our land and will be

90
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:16,001
like,

91
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:21,001
how do you determine this is our land
and it's not their land based on what

92
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:26,970
history? International law.
Interest. So Verdi. Yes.

93
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,940
How about empathy?
I have empathy.

94
00:06:29,941 --> 00:06:33,270
I'm just not willing to live to give
up on my identity and what I believe is

95
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,830
mine.
I'm afraid of the other side.

96
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,760
When I say that I'm afraid.

97
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,890
What I basically mean is I'm afraid of
going into Gaza because I knew that if I

98
00:06:49,891 --> 00:06:53,280
will go into Gaza, I might get
shot. Someone might kill me.

99
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,850
I think I hesitated a little bit.

100
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:00,020
I don't think I'm afraid of
the people on the other side.

101
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:05,260
I think I'm afraid of the gap and
sort of almost equally afraid of like,

102
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:12,010
you know that side taking all of their
responsibility for what is happening or

103
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:15,350
this side taking all of the
responsibility for what is happening,

104
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:17,240
which is obviously not working

105
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,470
well that's fair enough.

106
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:22,250
I don't believe that all Palestinians
are terrorists cause that doesn't make

107
00:07:22,251 --> 00:07:25,130
sense.
But I do believe that who is in charge,

108
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:29,990
they are leading the Palestinians to,
you know, hating us and in, in, in,

109
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:32,600
in a way that, you know,
eight is really unfair.

110
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:39,920
I'm against against what you saying they
are lot days lab because Islam didn't,

111
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:45,020
didn't say kill killing people or
having your blood don't belong that

112
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:50,110
cool Muslims, the radical Muslim
said come and do these things.

113
00:07:50,111 --> 00:07:52,570
What do you have to say?
They're not part of us.

114
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,510
We never accept them as Muslims
because they're teaching hate.

115
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,320
And in a way I accepted what you just
said about there's a big problem with our

116
00:07:59,321 --> 00:08:02,980
government. They don't know how to
talk to each other. And in my idea,

117
00:08:02,981 --> 00:08:06,010
I really think the people are the ones
that I should be talking to each other.

118
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:09,390
I agree. And I have to say also don't
think there's an issue with Muslims,

119
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:11,680
but I disagree with you about the
fact that it's about plans there.

120
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:15,750
There's several peace talks.
They were offered 97% of the land,

121
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:18,770
98 would have done it.
They disagree.

122
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:23,320
After deciding with the land,
they came and they built more settlements.

123
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,610
What's wrong?
What's wrong with Jews living in Judea?

124
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,630
That's not the problem.
The problem is,

125
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:30,870
is that we actually talked about
this land being for these people.

126
00:08:30,871 --> 00:08:34,080
And in the end when we see Israelis coming
in and actually building houses that

127
00:08:34,081 --> 00:08:36,000
showing us we. Dot. You
guys don't want peace.

128
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,713
I shrunk.

129
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:51,270
I serve in the IDF. So first of
all, I trust myself and my officers.

130
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,210
I do think that a lot of the
information I'm getting is not accurate,

131
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,970
which is why I tried to it
with different, uh, sources.

132
00:08:56,971 --> 00:08:59,640
And I also start to see it
from, from people, what they,

133
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,410
what they think would they feel

134
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,393
okay?

135
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:08,770
I don't trust everything. I
see on the news, that's for
sure. I do believe, again,

136
00:09:08,771 --> 00:09:11,170
there are two sides to every single story,

137
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:14,380
but I do see things that are
happening. For instance, you know,

138
00:09:14,381 --> 00:09:18,310
things like the rockets that are
striking or the stabs that are happening,

139
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:21,790
those things I do trust because I can
see that they're happening and they're

140
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:22,660
just unfair.

141
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,680
Like I see the,
the narrative being written.

142
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:30,470
I was like,
I watch TV.

143
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:35,500
I know how important and how powerful
language is and how it can create um,

144
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:39,650
reality and like I can,
I can see it.

145
00:09:39,651 --> 00:09:44,270
I like this is really
dangerous on both sides.

146
00:09:44,271 --> 00:09:45,500
It's really dangerous.

147
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:47,160
Overseas media that I see,

148
00:09:47,161 --> 00:09:50,730
they're always against Israel for things
that are not necessarily our fault.

149
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:55,010
I find it very funny because we look
at it as in start saying that they're

150
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:59,480
really with Israel, which is
funny. I find it kind of funny,

151
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,261
but no,

152
00:10:00,261 --> 00:10:04,940
I seriously do find the information that
we're getting has more as an agenda to

153
00:10:04,941 --> 00:10:08,240
it from both sides.
I don't believe in social media.

154
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,070
Like from the Israeli side,

155
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,760
I'm going to support Israel
and the Palestinian side
get a support. Palestinians.

156
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,990
People are going to be very confused and
I'm going to be very confused about the

157
00:10:17,991 --> 00:10:18,780
reality

158
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,670
smooth flavor date.
The question was the sources.

159
00:10:20,671 --> 00:10:24,470
So it doesn't have to be just social
media and I'm going to be poor.

160
00:10:24,471 --> 00:10:25,051
It's like this.

161
00:10:25,051 --> 00:10:28,530
Like I also trust the reports that the
Israel's six to security forces, uh,

162
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,320
publish,

163
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:34,320
but they are doing their ideas
about the reality in the situation,

164
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,270
but their ideas, how do they
are a seed, his situation,

165
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,040
it's not really what happened.

166
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:45,960
Political leaders on my
side to many compromises

167
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,220
per piece.

168
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:56,940
If we continue to do
what we did until now,

169
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,850
it's going to continue as it was now.

170
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,940
And I don't see it getting better.

171
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Our leaders should have our lives and
and the best for us in their minds.

172
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:14,930
And so it's not compromising
like pieces never compromising

173
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:18,170
the Palestinian bulletin. They, the,

174
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:22,440
they one a piece for they
selves and for the people,

175
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:27,380
but they have no power because the power,
it's not in they hand. It's the end,

176
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,500
the other side.

177
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:30,503
Okay.

178
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:36,250
I would like for us to compromise only
if you will be able to compromise.

179
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,220
It doesn't make sense that
every time that we have a war,

180
00:11:39,221 --> 00:11:43,540
it's always started by your side. The
other year, a day I just heard about,

181
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:48,070
you know, over 1,800 acres
of crops had been burned by,

182
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:52,990
you know, Hamas who have been sending
it over to Israel instead of, you know,

183
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:56,410
all that money in order to ruin us.

184
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:00,540
Why don't they spend it on taking
care of uh, Palestine? I talk,

185
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:03,650
just wait just one second.
You're talking about Hamas.

186
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:06,920
You have talking about Gaza.
It's so far from us.

187
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:08,660
We don't know what's going over there.

188
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:13,970
We don't know if you can ask me about
the West Bank. I'm can, I'm going to ask.

189
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:16,280
I'll answer.
I think you as well,

190
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,970
but here's the way I see it.
When you're talking about compromise,

191
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:22,930
Hamas' Charter says murder. Did she?
Wherever they are in the PA did.

192
00:12:22,931 --> 00:12:26,830
There's a golden bear and hold on,
hold on, hold on. But the PA, the PA,

193
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,660
let me finish it, but it's in the
authority that are the moderates.

194
00:12:31,661 --> 00:12:33,640
They're saying it's a death sentence.
If you sell your house,

195
00:12:33,641 --> 00:12:36,280
did you are there are racist
people of Israel of course,

196
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:38,230
are the racist people
everywhere in the world. Yes.

197
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:42,610
But we condemn people who are acting
violently and the other side glorifies

198
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:47,560
violence is justified.

199
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,560
Ooh,
I don't know.

200
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:57,990
If you're going to attack Israel,

201
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:03,020
then Israel is given to defend themselves
and that means when it comes to

202
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,690
certain things, maybe not
you specifically, but again,

203
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:10,620
to the radical Muslims, we
have to, because if we don't,

204
00:13:10,621 --> 00:13:13,260
then there's not going to be
a state of Israel anymore.

205
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:18,540
I don't think it's a matter of um,
Israeli Arabs or Jewish. As Christians.

206
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:20,250
Sometimes we laugh.
You have to use violence.

207
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,920
I hope it will be close
to zero as possible,

208
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:25,700
but if I see someone about
to murder someone else,

209
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:28,290
I think it's okay for me to
use violence to stop that.

210
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:31,740
I think violence is not
allowed for a political goal.

211
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,660
I think that's a bad
place to use violence.

212
00:13:33,661 --> 00:13:35,850
I prefer talking and having a discourse.

213
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:40,780
Okay. I didn't grow up with a, with
a lot of violence with zero violence,

214
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:45,190
but what I went to say
the same as you said,

215
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:49,060
who comes to my house to broke
the door to take my father.

216
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:52,300
Of course I will live in school myself,
so it's called a violence.

217
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:55,910
But I want a difference for myself first.

218
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:56,620
Well,

219
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:01,620
I am against violence 100% it's a freaking
circle is going to keep on happening

220
00:14:02,891 --> 00:14:04,600
over and over again for me.

221
00:14:04,601 --> 00:14:08,020
If you're going to react for
the violence with violence.

222
00:14:08,021 --> 00:14:12,370
So here we go.
We're having like the same problems,

223
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:17,670
the same generation who's a raise with
hatred and violence and love blood,

224
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:20,920
which is not accepted.

225
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:26,270
Is it important?

226
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:34,920
I think that Israel needs to be our
homeland because if we won't have a

227
00:14:34,921 --> 00:14:38,190
homeland, no one else is going
to accept us anywhere else.

228
00:14:38,191 --> 00:14:42,780
Especially because there's a lot
of racism and antisemitism as well.

229
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,300
So if we're not going to be here,
where are we going to go?

230
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:50,680
Okay. For me as a Muslim, the
Holy Land. It's why it's so,

231
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:56,420
first of all, because I was born here,
I have no place at another place.

232
00:14:57,150 --> 00:15:00,720
Every single person around the word had
the right to live in the plate that they

233
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:01,620
were born.

234
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:06,930
And that the right for Palestinians
also for if we're going to talk about

235
00:15:06,931 --> 00:15:11,310
refugees also, they have the right
to come back here, did their labs,

236
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:14,760
did their homes and uh,
have their places.

237
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:20,450
The fact that we came back to our homeland
and that we do have a country in a

238
00:15:23,071 --> 00:15:26,970
government here for me,
like it does feel like a miracle.

239
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,040
But I also think that the fact that
we do have the power now gives us more

240
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:34,010
responsibility.
Um,

241
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:39,110
and that we can't just base it on the
fact that it's our homeland and not hear

242
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:46,680
other voices saying we feel
the same about the same place.

243
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,640
My place.

244
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:56,980
Okay

245
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:01,120
all the time requested me if he's
more dialogue, more force, more. Um,

246
00:16:01,121 --> 00:16:05,320
conversation is more social media. I
always ask myself, what is the best thing?

247
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,010
I tend to believe that the best
thing is um, human interaction.

248
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:12,850
A lot of times I take a step
back from like the political,

249
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:17,890
the political argument about the conflict
and all of that just because I feel

250
00:16:17,891 --> 00:16:20,410
like I'm worthy and that
I don't know enough.

251
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,640
So it my way, I've always known
what I, what I am in this conflict.

252
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:30,960
I always knew I wanted to fight for peace.
That's all I knew.

253
00:16:30,961 --> 00:16:32,430
And that's all I will ever know.

254
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:37,410
I never was in the idea of this
conflict until my father passed away.

255
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:40,290
And then I had to think for myself.

256
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:45,300
I always was asking my
father why he was born

257
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,310
and his answer not to kill,
to live,

258
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:56,100
to be in life. And when
my sister, she got killed,

259
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:01,560
I went back to him to tell him.
He told me that he was born to live.

260
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:06,210
No. Okay. But my sister,
she was born to die.

261
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:10,960
They are a Palestinian,
they didn't kill 6 million Israelis.

262
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:15,300
And the Israelis is 10
[inaudible] 6 million Palestinian.

263
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:21,090
There is a Germanian embassy in Tel
Aviv and there isn't a German Israelis

264
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:26,680
empathy and Germania.
So

265
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:30,640
it's a big hole.
It's always gives me a hug.

266
00:17:30,641 --> 00:17:33,310
When I'm looking at this and
thinking a little bit about this,

267
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:36,480
I'm going to say I think it's,
it's, it's nice slogans. They just,

268
00:17:36,481 --> 00:17:37,650
I don't think that's the case.

269
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:42,360
Israel has a peace treaty with Egypt
because Egypt was willing to have peace

270
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:42,811
with Israel.

271
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:45,900
Israel has a peace treaty with Jordan
because the Jordanians were willing to

272
00:17:45,901 --> 00:17:47,370
have a pastry with,
with Israel.

273
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,680
Altaf run one to one. It's, it's different

274
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:53,820
how the way you think and the green,
which is exactly why I don't believe in a,

275
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,780
in a peace between the two sides
because in my understanding of reality,

276
00:17:57,781 --> 00:18:01,170
the whole concept of Palestinian
nationality because you don't accept

277
00:18:01,171 --> 00:18:03,210
Palestinians except human beings.

278
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:07,440
I'm saying that the whole
concept of destination reality
is one goal and that is

279
00:18:07,441 --> 00:18:11,910
the violation of Israel. Um, when
Jordan took over Judea and Samaria,

280
00:18:11,911 --> 00:18:14,410
when Egypt took over the Gaza
and no one asks for a post,

281
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:18,310
you were combining every one. You're
combining everyone into one ideology,

282
00:18:18,311 --> 00:18:20,140
which is not right. Why? What do you mean?

283
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:22,450
You're saying because they're
saying that they're Palestinians.

284
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,360
This is what they want,

285
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:28,540
which is not true. I, I take it back and
governments the Palestinian Authority.

286
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:34,000
Okay. I'm not saying I agree. It's, it's
different. I, I'm, I want to say, okay.

287
00:18:34,001 --> 00:18:36,160
We'll just, I don't refer to
the Arabs and Dan's scenarios.

288
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:40,930
[inaudible] they're referred to in this
scenario. If we were going to live long,

289
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:47,140
long gauge or [inaudible] we gonna see,
we're gonna see each other.

290
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:52,900
We, we're going to,
we're going to have it.

291
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:57,520
You can have it. No, no. I'm talking
about peace. We're going to have it.

292
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:58,483
Yeah.

293
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:04,550
Share with everyone.

294
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:14,763
Yeah.

295
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,300
Hello.
Hey guys.

296
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:42,640
I'm Johnny. I'm a dog. I think that

297
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,790
there's on top of some
passion fruit juice,

298
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,270
which gives the kick.

299
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:02,910
So how was the experience?
For me, it was perfect.

300
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:07,520
It was good.
It was a good meeting.

301
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,790
It was topsy turvy. It was
upside down if the Kenyan, yeah,

302
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:19,190
like I say that because like you don't
know who's was in front of you and you

303
00:20:19,191 --> 00:20:22,490
don't know their ideas. Do your
ideology, what they think about you.

304
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:26,740
I think we did come to some sort of an
agreement that we both do one piece,

305
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,100
security freedom and prosperity.
You were talking about legal piece.

306
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:38,040
I don't want a piece of paper and it
says peace. I want to live in peace.

307
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:40,140
I don't want a piece of paper
says we have a peace treaty

308
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:47,980
but we don't agree because I don't believe
in a Palestinian state and you think

309
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,850
you should have like a two state
solution so we don't agree and it's,

310
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:55,230
so let's say we wanted a one state
solution Israel with everyone equal I'm,

311
00:20:55,231 --> 00:20:56,610
I'm fine with it. Yeah, exactly.

312
00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:02,610
Well I learned from you that you have
a lot of sympathy for ass side as well.

313
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:07,900
Even though your, your sister passed away,
which is terrible. She didn't pass away.

314
00:21:07,901 --> 00:21:08,734
She wasn't married.

315
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:12,250
But I can see that you also have sympathy
for the other side and you actually

316
00:21:12,251 --> 00:21:14,050
are trying to,
you know,

317
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:18,100
communicate with us even though you went
through everything that you had to go

318
00:21:18,101 --> 00:21:19,510
through on your end.

319
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:25,590
And I definitely learned that we can
learn to love your site as well or I could

320
00:21:26,471 --> 00:21:27,940
learn till that bureau side as well.

321
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:34,630
I think this is the main 0.4 hour maybe
conflict that we did not hear from each

322
00:21:35,631 --> 00:21:39,560
other. So I think it's important
to hear from each other,

323
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:45,100
not just keep your thoughts and ideas
inside your head and don't try to Aventis

324
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:47,840
box,
just tried to open it.

325
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:52,860
We want really similar things. Um, yeah.

326
00:21:52,861 --> 00:21:56,880
And it's sort of, you feel like
you know, my friends from back.

327
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:03,260
And so the realization that we do
have the same sort of language,

328
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:07,140
not,
not in like the language that we speak,

329
00:22:07,141 --> 00:22:12,141
but in our body language and the things
that interest us in the future that we

330
00:22:12,811 --> 00:22:17,190
hold for ourselves and for families.
Like there are no sides.

331
00:22:17,191 --> 00:22:19,590
Like I can't draw a line
and say, okay, I'm like

332
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,460
these people or with these people,

333
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,400
hey guys,
this is Jason and this is John.

334
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:31,620
And just want to say thank
you so much for watching.

335
00:22:31,621 --> 00:22:33,720
I really special episode of Middle Ground.
Uh,

336
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:38,130
we love this series because it's an
opportunity now more than ever to create

337
00:22:38,131 --> 00:22:40,530
great dialogue and create radical.
Yes.

338
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,180
Bothy uh,
this was a challenge,

339
00:22:43,181 --> 00:22:47,590
but also a privilege to get to go to
Jerusalem to film this dialogue around a

340
00:22:47,591 --> 00:22:50,980
subject that is very
tricky and very difficult,

341
00:22:50,981 --> 00:22:53,800
but we loved having the challenge.
Totally.

342
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,750
You want to say a huge shout out
to youtube and created for change,

343
00:22:56,751 --> 00:22:59,420

and the support to do this.

344
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,190
