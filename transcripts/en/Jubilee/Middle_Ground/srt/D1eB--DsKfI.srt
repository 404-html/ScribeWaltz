1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,720
We built a society where we're told to
go to college, find someone we love,

2
00:00:03,721 --> 00:00:06,300
work a job for 50 years and we're
going to live happily ever after.

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:07,650
But it doesn't happen,

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,850
but we don't necessarily feel it that
you guys actually set us up for success.

5
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,830
Can I have my millennials stand in the
right ball of light and my baby boomers

6
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,240
on the left tool at light

7
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:37,480
when it comes to jobs,
you should do what you want.

8
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:38,363
Love.

9
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:49,730
I'm going to say, hell yes. Do what
you love because if you don't love it,

10
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:53,240
you want to do a good job, then get quit
and bring a company down, et Cetera,

11
00:00:53,241 --> 00:00:55,260
et cetera. I agree. I mean,

12
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:00,560
I tried to put myself in a position to
stay away from things that I don't like.

13
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,310
I hated to go into school,

14
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:07,470
so I left and I cannot tell
you how powerful that was.

15
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:13,110
I'm the CEO and founder of tens of tea.
I went to Ucla, hated going to school,

16
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,410
so I dropped out after three
years and became an entrepreneur.

17
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,010
It just occurred to me though.

18
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:22,480
I wonder if maybe we're all fortunate
enough that we can because not everybody

19
00:01:22,481 --> 00:01:23,910
gets to just do what they love.

20
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,920
Maybe circumstances don't allow
that depending on, you know,

21
00:01:26,921 --> 00:01:30,940
I'm just fortunate I was brought up
in a family that allowed me to explore

22
00:01:30,941 --> 00:01:34,600
options and paid for me to go to college
and even though we all agree that you

23
00:01:34,601 --> 00:01:36,340
should do what you love,

24
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,610
I agree with you completely
and it went through my mind,

25
00:01:39,611 --> 00:01:42,430
but I think that it's important,
at least for me to say,

26
00:01:42,431 --> 00:01:46,150
everyone should be able to do what they
love and to have that be an expectation

27
00:01:46,151 --> 00:01:49,300
for everyone and not have it be an
expectation. Okay, well you know,

28
00:01:49,301 --> 00:01:51,280
if you have challenges in your life,

29
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:53,020
then you'll never be
able to do what you love.

30
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,930
We had a Japanese restaurant
growing up and I cooked tempera,

31
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:01,241
you know,

32
00:02:01,241 --> 00:02:05,860
did my homework and took naps on the
stocks of bags of rice that we had in the

33
00:02:05,861 --> 00:02:10,000
back. Did I love it? No, but we did
it because it was part of survival.

34
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:15,480
I did computer science and I was a program
or for 10 years before I decided to

35
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:20,270
pursue what I really love,
which was music. So Dede,

36
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,090
I don't agree with that statement.

37
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:26,080
Do you love all the jobs and I'm
sure your goal to do what you love,

38
00:02:26,081 --> 00:02:29,350
don't you think like whatever. It might
have to take steps to get to that,

39
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:32,440
but that's what I worry about if
we're going to talk about generational

40
00:02:32,441 --> 00:02:33,370
differences.

41
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:36,970
I own a couple of businesses in Missouri
and I think sometimes the younger

42
00:02:36,971 --> 00:02:40,360
generation doesn't get that part,
that just be to do what you love.

43
00:02:40,361 --> 00:02:42,000
Sometimes you have to do
some things you hate to get

44
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,533
fair.

45
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:47,070
Millennials don't work as
hard as previous generations.

46
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,143
Yes,

47
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:59,260
I live in southern Missouri and I
own a couple of businesses there.

48
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:03,490
So I do think when I'm in La
I notice a big difference.

49
00:03:03,491 --> 00:03:06,280
So I think part of it is a
geographic thing. You know,

50
00:03:06,281 --> 00:03:09,970
I live in a small town in the
middle of nowhere where you know,

51
00:03:09,971 --> 00:03:13,000
people don't have role models necessarily
that or to look up to that are,

52
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,650
are as motivated. And it's also really
easy to get free stuff. You know,

53
00:03:17,651 --> 00:03:22,540
low income housing, food stamps and
disability. Or they'll come to me and say,

54
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:25,390
well, I can only work 25 hours a week
because if I work more than that,

55
00:03:25,391 --> 00:03:28,420
I'm going to lose my low income housing.
Like I said,

56
00:03:28,421 --> 00:03:32,680
I think that's partly the society where
I live makes it too easy not to work.

57
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:37,880
I think a baby boomer is somebody who
was taught to work hard and that if you

58
00:03:37,881 --> 00:03:40,430
want something, you have to figure
out how to go out and get it.

59
00:03:40,431 --> 00:03:44,600
And don't wait for somebody to hand it
to you. If you try hard enough, you can.

60
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,130
You can get about anything you want.

61
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:48,183
Oh,

62
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,630
I wasn't talking about you guys.

63
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:56,690
So it all depends on who you know
and who you run into around me.

64
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,870
There's sure a lot of millennials
that are working hard.

65
00:03:59,871 --> 00:04:02,300
I know I hear stories
about others who are lazy,

66
00:04:02,301 --> 00:04:06,220
but isn't that the truth
in any generation? Yes.

67
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:10,120
I work with a younger generation
all the time. And so I,

68
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:13,910
I mean they come in 24 seven you know,
they're working very,

69
00:04:13,911 --> 00:04:17,120
very hard and I couldn't work
without the younger generation.

70
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:19,520
I wouldn't want to work that.
The younger generation,

71
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:25,240
I think millennials work harder than
previous generations for less safety net

72
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,600
and less structural stability.

73
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:32,630
And I think you see people who maybe
they're not trying to go to work as hard

74
00:04:33,511 --> 00:04:37,740
because they know that if they try and
they lose whatever assistance they have

75
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:40,290
or if they tried to go to school and
they get in debt and they can ever pay it

76
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:43,920
out or know that they can never live
in a place other than that low income

77
00:04:43,921 --> 00:04:44,760
housing unit,

78
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,120
then there's like a lack of agency
maybe to try but also so many forces.

79
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:50,971
And then you know,

80
00:04:50,971 --> 00:04:54,120
you have all these companies that are
trying to get leaner and deliver on short

81
00:04:54,121 --> 00:04:56,640
term profits.
So they hire people as contractors.

82
00:04:56,641 --> 00:04:59,310
Like all my friends are contractors
and they don't have health insurance,

83
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:00,900
they don't have any of these other things.

84
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:03,000
And then so like they've
got to work harder.

85
00:05:03,001 --> 00:05:04,950
So I guess when I hear
that about millennials,

86
00:05:04,951 --> 00:05:09,000
it makes me upset just because I
know how hard my friends are working.

87
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:14,620
I think the word millennial is often
use to portray a small slice of

88
00:05:14,661 --> 00:05:17,270
millennials. I don't quite
fit some of those stereotypes,

89
00:05:17,271 --> 00:05:19,280
but I don't think there's
a single stereotype either

90
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,770
young people today face harder
challenges than any previous generation.

91
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:26,843
Oh yeah.

92
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:32,570
I'm actually gonna to disagree.
Okay.

93
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:35,790
Oh cool.
Can't wait to get that.

94
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,630
I think the biggest challenge
facing young people days,

95
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:44,631
the environment and that we're growing
up in a world that is not being taken

96
00:05:45,301 --> 00:05:50,250
care of and what that means for, you know,
me and my children, if I have children,

97
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:52,230
what type of world they're
going to be living in.

98
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:55,590
And I just think it's not
something we're addressing at all.

99
00:05:55,830 --> 00:06:00,080
I think the social media, it, like
I said, it can be a great tool,

100
00:06:00,081 --> 00:06:03,850
but I also think it can make life
more difficult for people. Um,

101
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,510
because you can get offended or
bullied or relationships can be totally

102
00:06:08,511 --> 00:06:10,160
different now because of,
you know,

103
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:12,470
people break up with you
over a text or whatever.

104
00:06:12,471 --> 00:06:16,790
And I think that's adds benefits,
challenges to that we didn't have

105
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,590
as an adult.
Um,

106
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:23,050
I find it hard to compare it to my mother
and her generation when it comes to

107
00:06:23,051 --> 00:06:26,470
meet you and to buy a house. So when
it comes to me trying to save money,

108
00:06:26,471 --> 00:06:30,250
because I am one of those contract
workers and I do want a family and so is,

109
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,800
do I continue doing what I love?
I do.

110
00:06:32,801 --> 00:06:37,801
I did go back into the though rat race
and try to get ahead and try to do Xyz.

111
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:41,680
That's the pressure that I
face on a day to day. Right.

112
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:48,810
Companies that hired you for life and
you have tension, you had good to let,

113
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,300
you know, that's all
gone. All gone understand.

114
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:55,950
The cost of living is so high. Or if
you live in a place where it's not high,

115
00:06:55,951 --> 00:06:59,400
then there were no jobs. You know,
I think it's harder for you guys.

116
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,013
Okay.

117
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,280
It's good to hear all your points.
Um,

118
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:09,960
I still think that we
actually have it a lot easier.

119
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,610
Um, and I think the problem is
that we expect too much. Um,

120
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:18,120
I don't think that we should deserve
to assume that we're going to get to

121
00:07:18,121 --> 00:07:20,310
immediately be able to afford a house.

122
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:23,070
And I think that we have a
lot of things going for us.

123
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:27,180
And I learned a lot of really
valuable skills completely for free.

124
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,480
You can join Facebook groups
and meet other entrepreneurs.

125
00:07:30,481 --> 00:07:31,710
It doesn't cost any money.

126
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:37,040
You can literally take classes at MIT
and Harvard for free classes online

127
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,780
and you guys didn't have that
access to information was in there.

128
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:46,530
I totally get the financial
and environmental challenges.

129
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,980
So I think that we have the
resources to kind of solve them.

130
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:52,670
It's important to, you know, want to be a,

131
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:56,050
have leave each generation
better than we found it. Um,

132
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,990
because if we lose sight of that, then
you know, what are we working for?

133
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:04,590
My children will grow up in
a better world than I did

134
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:06,830
shit. Yeah, absolutely.

135
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:13,821
Absolutely.

136
00:08:13,821 --> 00:08:18,630
Because I'll make sure that
I think absolutely. Yeah,

137
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:19,543
absolutely.

138
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:21,920
For me.
I am determined when I do start,

139
00:08:21,921 --> 00:08:25,580
my family did that they will have
a better life than what I've had.

140
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,740
I'm going to make sure as a father,

141
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:31,700
as a provider did that pastor
happened period point blank.

142
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:36,530
I don't have children but I'm speaking
for children in general is even though I

143
00:08:36,531 --> 00:08:39,230
first said life is harder
for a younger generation,

144
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:42,650
I think you're right and you know
healthcare is getting so much better,

145
00:08:42,651 --> 00:08:47,030
so much faster and then the Internet has
made so many more things possible that

146
00:08:47,031 --> 00:08:51,860
I do think that young people will grow up
in an easier world overall then we did.

147
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:55,800
I definitely agree with the personal
sentiment that we all share, but I do,

148
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,710
I do like think that one of the things
we didn't really have to talk about was

149
00:08:58,711 --> 00:09:00,540
that like we don't
necessarily feel that the,

150
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:03,690
you guys actually set us up for success.

151
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:08,390
Like essentially we built a society
where we're told to go to college,

152
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:12,720
find someone we love and go buy a house
and work a job for 50 years and we're

153
00:09:12,721 --> 00:09:15,480
going to live happily ever after.
But it doesn't happen.

154
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:19,890
I just don't get like how do you guys
assumed that we were going to be able to

155
00:09:19,891 --> 00:09:21,120
do that exact same thing?

156
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:24,350
No, no. We'll all I know
I don't assume that,

157
00:09:24,351 --> 00:09:29,150
but what I do is that I put the work
in so when you put the work in and, and

158
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,560
maybe not you per se,

159
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:36,290
but the larger mindset of the
boomers is necessarily, you know,

160
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:39,290
you guys are working like I did
and you guys be okay. Like, Nah.

161
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:42,780
I think the expectations are changing.
Like I,

162
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:45,220
everything you said about the
house in the marriage, you know,

163
00:09:45,221 --> 00:09:48,520
I mean in my generation and that
was my job as a female wisdom.

164
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:49,660
Catch your husband.

165
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:53,170
That's right. That's why we went to
college. That's why women went to cut.

166
00:09:53,171 --> 00:09:54,880
That's when my Mrs Degree College,

167
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:59,930
your generation has so many more
opportunities in a wider vision of what

168
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:03,440
happiness can look like and that it
doesn't necessarily mean you're going to

169
00:10:03,441 --> 00:10:07,160
live in a house with a picket fence and
you're going to have 2.2 kids and you're

170
00:10:07,161 --> 00:10:08,960
going to stay in the same job forever.
I mean,

171
00:10:08,961 --> 00:10:12,470
I think you have so many more
options available to you.

172
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:16,100
Some of that has shifted for you.
So I hope at least it has.

173
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,820
I think that's what I love about the
younger generation now is that they're

174
00:10:19,821 --> 00:10:23,920
working on themselves first as opposed
to falling in love and you know,

175
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:24,430
getting it right.

176
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:26,930
That's going to be all well and good.

177
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,240
But I think what we're saying is we've
been sewed up a creek without a paddle.

178
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:34,990
Okay,

179
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:39,990
well I'm a mom so I'm looking at
the future and I feel for you guys,

180
00:10:40,091 --> 00:10:42,880
you know who you're working hard,
which is great,

181
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:46,330
but everything is getting more
expensive on the environment. Yes,

182
00:10:46,331 --> 00:10:47,230
that is a concern.

183
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:52,530
But one of the things that really
concerns me is a national debt and we're

184
00:10:52,691 --> 00:10:56,920
borrowing and borrowing from the future
or kicking the can down the road,

185
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:02,020
letting you guys and your kids and your
grandkids take care of it. So I, you know,

186
00:11:02,021 --> 00:11:06,520
I, on behalf of our generation,
at least on that aspect of life,

187
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:08,890
we're really sorry we're,
we are,

188
00:11:08,891 --> 00:11:13,030
we're leaving a big mess for you guys
and I just pray for you guys pretty far.

189
00:11:13,031 --> 00:11:16,390
Children, I am hopeful to.
I'm optimistic for our kids,

190
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:21,060
but I'm also well aware of some troubles
that we're leaving our next generation.

191
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:25,040
Yeah, but I will tell you this, you
will survive. I don't want to survive.

192
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:30,070
You will
survive you all three of it.

193
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:35,320
You can't be entitled to anything.
I'm entitled.

194
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:40,510
We want what we want. The what
was, what did the new deal.

195
00:11:40,511 --> 00:11:43,510
There wasn't a cell for. We want
that too. That's all we're saying.

196
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,860
We want the basics of the American
dream period. There you go.

197
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:49,130
All right.
That's all the time.

198
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,270
Hey guys,
