1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:05,090
I don't think that a lot of men
realize how scary just they.

2
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:07,933
Oh,

3
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:22,990
hi.
My name is [inaudible].

4
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:27,110
I'm from New Jersey originally and
I'm a publicist here in way. Hi Guys.

5
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,390
I'm Brett and I work in film.

6
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:34,730
I'm Gabby and I work in film
as well. I act. Hi everyone.

7
00:00:34,731 --> 00:00:39,230
I'm Cory Aa. I'm from Los Angeles and
I'm in advertising and recruiting.

8
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:43,460
My name is far Huda. I'm born and raised
in La and I'm a writer and a director.

9
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:48,320
My name is Joe 25 years old and a
marketing coordinator here in La.

10
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,093
Yeah.

11
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:07,730
Not to say that this is a sound factor
that you know, there aren't exceptions,

12
00:01:07,731 --> 00:01:11,210
but I think, you know, men are
there, they're built differently,

13
00:01:11,211 --> 00:01:14,870
there's those stronger. Um,
usually I can say, yeah,

14
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,540
physically is a one inherent difference.

15
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:22,050
Obviously it changes based on like their
race and gender or like the like where

16
00:01:22,051 --> 00:01:22,950
they're from and stuff like that.

17
00:01:22,951 --> 00:01:27,951
But I think that women tend to sometimes
be a lot more over emotional and where

18
00:01:29,101 --> 00:01:34,101
men tend to kind of respond a little
bit more stoically and that might not be

19
00:01:35,491 --> 00:01:37,980
the most perfect way to say it,
but I think of it.

20
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:42,130
Do you think that's
unnatural way that we are,

21
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,980
we're born to be or do you think
that's how we're brought up?

22
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:46,530
I think it's a mixture of both.

23
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:49,350
Lexis oil might just be how
society has ingrained in them.

24
00:01:49,351 --> 00:01:53,160
They should react to certain things
to men are supposed to be this like

25
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,150
sometimes uncompromising,
not unemotional person,

26
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,980
whereas the women are supposed
to be bullshit. Is that,

27
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:01,740
I think that people sometimes like fall
into those categories and even when

28
00:02:01,741 --> 00:02:04,290
they're not supposed to be.
I feel like even as a man,

29
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:08,160
like you know how I approach
a problem is like, oh,

30
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:09,480
how can I fix this thing?

31
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:14,130
Whereas like a lot of my
female friends are like, like,

32
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:18,920
I don't need to fix it. I just need
to listen to this person. And uh,

33
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:22,400
and like for me, like that's just
not my natural impulse. Yeah.

34
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,930
There's so many men who people will say,
Oh yeah,

35
00:02:26,931 --> 00:02:31,280
men are always stronger. Always this,
always that. Well tell that to a female,

36
00:02:31,281 --> 00:02:34,010
UFC fighters will kick their ass.
You know what I'm saying?

37
00:02:34,011 --> 00:02:36,090
And there are also a lot of options,

38
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:42,110
but there are a lot of people who will
say, oh, women are always hyper emotional.

39
00:02:42,111 --> 00:02:45,470
And then to lead to a bleeding heart
guy who is just like the biggest,

40
00:02:45,471 --> 00:02:47,300
most passionate person.
I mean,

41
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:51,680
so I just think generalization is
always problematic. My husband is,

42
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:55,800
he's one of those guys that cries
in like every movie, you know,

43
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:57,770
and like I love that. And I'm like, okay,

44
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:00,850
very assertive fiery person,

45
00:03:00,851 --> 00:03:04,630
which is like generally attributed
to masculine and quality,

46
00:03:04,631 --> 00:03:09,631
which in itself is problematic that we
think like strength is mass scale and

47
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,050
problem solving is masculine.

48
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:17,650
We're all capable and we're
all also have our weaknesses.

49
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,150
Ooh,
we gotta leave.

50
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,420
Definitely. I've experienced
a lot of disadvantages. Um,

51
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:46,150
it's been particularly in the workforce,
in my position, I'm pretty high up.

52
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:49,600
I kind of sit on the rights, you
know, right hand of the president.

53
00:03:49,601 --> 00:03:53,630
But it's just kind of interesting how
I'm always left with all these like

54
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:57,220
administrative task, you know
what I mean? And I'm like,

55
00:03:57,221 --> 00:04:01,720
well what about him and him and
him and him and him. But it's just,

56
00:04:01,721 --> 00:04:05,110
I think it's natural for people to
associate administrative work with a,

57
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:09,660
you know, it's a feminine role. Same. Uh,
I work at a hardware store and which is,

58
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:13,940
I get looked over all the time cause
I'm like, hi, how can I help you?

59
00:04:13,941 --> 00:04:17,360
And there go, I'm going to ask
this guy like literally just,

60
00:04:17,361 --> 00:04:18,470
or not even talk to me.

61
00:04:18,471 --> 00:04:21,920
They'll just walk right past me and
go ask a man to touch on more like

62
00:04:21,921 --> 00:04:24,290
disadvantages,
like just having to think,

63
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:28,610
I think to be more conscious of a lot of
things like people say like walking to

64
00:04:28,611 --> 00:04:32,360
your car at night or going for a jog
or just any, anything at night really.

65
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:36,890
In thinking about it, I was like, well
what is the disadvantage of being a man?

66
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,580
And I thought back to when
I was six, seven, eight,

67
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:46,040
and I was in the school yard and in
the classroom and my friends started to

68
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:49,280
police me because the girls
weren't getting policed.

69
00:04:49,281 --> 00:04:52,850
From what I understand the way that the
boys, because the boys were being told,

70
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:58,310
don't be like a girl, don't
cry, don't share your emotions,

71
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,670
don't show your feelings.
Because I wanted to fit in.

72
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,890
I embodied those ideas

73
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,580
when I was considering this question,
you know,

74
00:05:06,581 --> 00:05:10,990
do I have disadvantages based on
my gender? Impulsive and just, no.

75
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:15,200
Like as, as a white man
who raised in, you know,

76
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,140
middle class America, like right
off the bat, you have so many, um,

77
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:23,290
like lack of barriers I should say.
You have,

78
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,820
you have a lack of
barriers for opportunity.

79
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:42,380
Well, I just would like to let everyone
know that I do not open my own doors.

80
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:51,670
Don't miss seriously though. So if I'm
walking too, if I'm with a male, yeah,

81
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,890
if I'm walking to the door, I
won't touch the door. Um, however,

82
00:05:54,891 --> 00:05:57,920
if I do open a door, if I'm by
myself, there's people behind me,

83
00:05:57,921 --> 00:06:01,370
I'm keeping it open. And whole family,
females, males, no problem at all.

84
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:06,470
But if I'm with a male I will not open
the door. You just stand there. Yeah.

85
00:06:06,471 --> 00:06:09,650
Look real stupid too. Cause they usually
stand there like as a joke and I'm like

86
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:14,720
where does that expectation come from?
Yeah.

87
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,380
I'm sure it was just the way I was raised

88
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,930
for me as a guy.
Like my instinct is like,

89
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:25,310
you know how my dad taught me and
my brother is just like, you know,

90
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:28,460
treat women with the
utmost respect and honor.

91
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:32,450
I feel like chivalry is just something
that I'm like this is absolutely

92
00:06:32,451 --> 00:06:35,880
something I want to step into
and to continue and uphold. Yeah.

93
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:41,150
I think that's like a really beautiful
way to put it. I also think it's not true.

94
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:45,410
Like that's not born out of like
serve because she's up here.

95
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:50,630
It's because we don't, it's,
it's the opposite of empowerment.

96
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,720
The same reason why a guy
doesn't think that you can,

97
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,050
you know what?

98
00:06:57,051 --> 00:07:02,051
Screw that is is the same reason why
they think they have to open the door or

99
00:07:03,111 --> 00:07:06,530
why it hurts. Why chivalry
can hurt. Cause the,

100
00:07:06,531 --> 00:07:11,531
the idea that like we have to protect
and we have to like do things for them,

101
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,640
it translates I,

102
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:18,670
it's equal to the idea that
because they are unable to,

103
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:32,281
generally speaking,

104
00:07:32,281 --> 00:07:35,490
I always feel pretty comfortable
when I'm with the opposite gender.

105
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:40,140
I am the youngest and I have
three brothers and I have
a lot of male figures in

106
00:07:40,141 --> 00:07:44,400
my life. So I think that that may
influence my feelings on that.

107
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:50,350
I grew up in a family full of women.
Literally mom had like three sisters,

108
00:07:50,351 --> 00:07:55,351
like all of them have pretty much girls
until I was about 13 so 100% feel like

109
00:07:55,421 --> 00:07:58,630
I'm comfortable with women being
around me. I'm a gay black man.

110
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:02,380
So literally the community just for gay
black people or just with gay people in

111
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:03,214
general,

112
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,860
you always have like your best girlfriend
that's going to be there on your side

113
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:09,520
regardless of whether you just met them
or whether you've known them for 25

114
00:08:09,521 --> 00:08:10,354
years.

115
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:17,110
I don't think that a lot of men
realize how scary just they are.

116
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:23,090
And how many men just hanging
out, like feel like, oh,

117
00:08:23,091 --> 00:08:26,540
that girl could literally kill me.
Like that's a true thing.

118
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:30,290
Come from a family that's like has
really strong female personalities.

119
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:33,690
You don't doubt that anything that they
can do because they went to dependence

120
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,830
on the family.
They were the ones that raise everybody.

121
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:39,560
They were the strongest people in
the family. So I don't, I don't know.

122
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,520
I understand you're, yeah,
I mean I, I in high school,

123
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:43,540
like I was on the wrestling team,

124
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:47,080
I was one of three girls on the all boy
wrestling team and I was like, yeah,

125
00:08:47,081 --> 00:08:50,860
this is awesome. Like I'm one of the
guys, this is cool. And you know,

126
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:54,490
one of the guys like held
a knife to my throat,

127
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:58,480
like behind the bleachers at
a game. And you know, you,

128
00:08:58,481 --> 00:09:03,370
you want to be able to trust and be like,
okay, I don't know you, so I'm going to,

129
00:09:03,371 --> 00:09:05,580
you know, give me, give you
my trust for a little bit.

130
00:09:05,581 --> 00:09:10,400
And then all of a sudden
you're on top of me. When,

131
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,200
when do I choose? And you're
like, who do I choose?

132
00:09:13,201 --> 00:09:16,200
And so it's like I've never
had that with a woman. So,

133
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:19,423
ah,

134
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:28,820
I don't think I've always been comfortable
and I am a very private person. Um,

135
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:33,370
and so I'm very intentional about the
relationships that I build and about the

136
00:09:33,371 --> 00:09:34,570
people who I am vulnerable.

137
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:39,120
I wasn't always comfortable sharing my
emotions in check from childhood to,

138
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:43,440
you know, my mid twenties or so. I
think it was more of just like dislike.

139
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:45,780
I mean bottle it up,
I'll share with a few people,

140
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,910
but it wasn't something
I would share freely.

141
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:52,940
And I think now where I'm at is I see
true power and vulnerability absolutely

142
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:57,450
share and not fear. Um, you
know, judgment or shame.

143
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:05,810
I am strong and the way that
I talk and just being strong,

144
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,430
people are like, oh, you're angry.
You're, you know, you're don't make sense.

145
00:10:10,431 --> 00:10:12,500
I'm like, no, I make a
lot of sense right now.

146
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:16,580
You know,
you're awesome.

147
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:21,700
Just the fact that I have an emotion
makes me unreliable in some way.

148
00:10:21,771 --> 00:10:26,300
And people's eyes. Like, we can't
have a woman running the country.

149
00:10:26,301 --> 00:10:30,500
What if she's on her period? We'll go
to war. Well, I haven't seen it yet.

150
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:35,680
I am only uncomfortable in
how I am perceived because
I do want to be perceived

151
00:10:35,961 --> 00:10:39,380
as a competent person and
somebody who can be trusted.

152
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,720
I have taught myself to become emotional,

153
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:45,680
but from my family and from
being a black person in America,

154
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,010
I don't think that I am
comfortable being emotional.

155
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,770
I feel like it's like me losing control.

156
00:10:50,771 --> 00:10:54,800
It's me being vulnerable and I don't
like being vulnerable to anybody unless I

157
00:10:54,801 --> 00:10:56,780
choose to.
And I think that bats,

158
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:00,740
it's a sad thing because like I should
be able to cry whenever I feel like it,

159
00:11:00,741 --> 00:11:03,140
but I don't.
Or if I do cry,

160
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:07,280
like I lost a family member last
year and broke into tears and work.

161
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:11,300
As soon as I realized that I was crying,
I stopped and I said, I have to go home.

162
00:11:11,301 --> 00:11:14,060
I apologize. I'm leaving
right now. And that's,

163
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:17,180
that's just how I had the respond to it.
And I don't think that's healthy,

164
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,580
but it's something that I that with,

165
00:11:19,581 --> 00:11:22,790
that's just my personal experience
when it comes to being a male,

166
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:23,690
a black male in a marriage.

167
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,450
Yeah. I'm thinking it kind of goes back
to just women being the most approachable

168
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:44,760
people that I can come to and talk about
anything when it comes to me or just my

169
00:11:44,761 --> 00:11:46,950
experience is a little,
like the things I've had to go through.

170
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:50,550
There are a lot more understanding
and I don't know, I just feel safe.

171
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,200
My experience again with
the opposite sex is it's

172
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:57,400
been pleasant. You know, my entire
life I've always felt comfortable.

173
00:11:57,401 --> 00:12:01,870
I've always felt understood.
I've always felt like I had,
uh, uh, a voice, you know,

174
00:12:01,871 --> 00:12:04,260
even if it's not again, the
voice in the conference room. Um,

175
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:06,460
I always felt like I've
always been respected.

176
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:12,190
I think like as a general role,
suave,

177
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,100
like take looking at it that way.

178
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:20,130
No men don't understand women and it's
because we're looking at it as two

179
00:12:23,921 --> 00:12:24,940
different things.

180
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:30,240
Like even the idea of being
assertive comes off as being a bitch.

181
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:33,430
Are you speaking from a personal
place or societal place?

182
00:12:33,431 --> 00:12:34,450
Cause I feel like you're,

183
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:39,460
you speak from a very
like big place instead of,

184
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,250
so it's all the same because
the question was like,

185
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:46,090
I not like society.
Yeah.

186
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,190
Do I feel understood by Matt? Yeah. No,

187
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,520
because they don't view me as an equal

188
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:56,650
in this space. Do you feel understood? Um,

189
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:01,500
I feel understood equally by all parties,

190
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:06,020
not, but, but you know, like, I sure,

191
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:11,240
you know, I believe that we're
all, um, image bearers, you know,

192
00:13:11,241 --> 00:13:13,880
image bearers of God
and like bet were equal.

193
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:19,010
Then we're given these different roles
to fulfill. And then when you see, uh,

194
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:23,180
two people dancing and it's
a beautiful Cory graft,

195
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:26,970
equal dance, no one's out
showing the other person. Um,

196
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:30,950
but when it comes to like,
relationships with men and women,

197
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:34,970
like I feel like these
different roles can be such a,

198
00:13:34,971 --> 00:13:36,620
a beautiful thing when done right,

199
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:41,650
but can also be a
disaster if one person is,

200
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:42,411
you know,

201
00:13:42,411 --> 00:13:47,411
trying to outperform or other person
is taking advantage or overstepping.

202
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,070
Okay.

203
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:49,641
Like you said,

204
00:13:49,641 --> 00:13:54,641
there's such a beauty in differences and
in masculinity and femininity and it's

205
00:13:55,851 --> 00:13:58,550
important to have both in yourself

206
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:04,080
and you a picture.

207
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:07,883
You guys

208
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:17,370
okay?
