1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,210
I wouldn't dare try.

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:06,350
I don't even want the possibility of
becoming addicted to something that is

3
00:00:06,511 --> 00:00:08,760
going to make me physical
dependent upon it.

4
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:24,650
My name is Kayla and
I'm a recovery advocate.

5
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,810
Hi, my name is Chris and I'm a cannabis
advocate. Hi, my name is Devin and a,

6
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,370
I'm fascinated with mental health.
My name is [inaudible],

7
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,670
but the green goes JC and I am a pro.

8
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:40,400
These things that are grow
out of the ground and make us

9
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,620
shift perspective. My
name is [inaudible]. Um,

10
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,040
I am honestly middle ground.

11
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,230
My name is Kiki Dexter
and I'm here pro marijuana

12
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:58,503
drugs.

13
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:07,420
So my sister went to rehab
for a extensive drug's usage.

14
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:12,020
It affected her life very
heavily and was in rehab cost.

15
00:01:12,021 --> 00:01:14,060
My parents a lot of time, energy, money,

16
00:01:14,061 --> 00:01:17,000
and just emotional draining
for the whole family.

17
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,200
My Dad is a very adamantly trying,

18
00:01:20,201 --> 00:01:23,710
recovering heroin addict.
I think he froze,

19
00:01:23,711 --> 00:01:28,711
got addicted when he was like 2021 it was
the influx of drugs into the cities in

20
00:01:29,921 --> 00:01:32,860
the 80s it still affects his life.

21
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:38,100
I had a physical dependence on
prescription anti anxiety medication,

22
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:43,360
Klonopin specifically
for like seven years.

23
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:47,290
I went to treatment like three years ago.
Um, and eventually found my way back.

24
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:51,370
I would consider myself sober. I've been
sober for like two and a half years.

25
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:54,890
Alcohol played a big role in my life.
Marijuana played a big role in my life.

26
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,280
I did notice,
uh,

27
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:01,250
going into my twenties that the pattern
that I do have a propensity to want to

28
00:02:01,251 --> 00:02:04,700
get fucked up now.
Like I don't smoke,

29
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:07,430
I don't drink or at least
that's my intention.

30
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:09,980
But there comes a time when it's like,
cool.

31
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:14,240
I think I could go for a nice
LSD trip. Woods, that'd be nice.

32
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,970
People often become emotionally
dependent on recreational drugs.

33
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:33,050
Yeah, I think they do. Um, for
example, I had a great childhood,

34
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,490
but I was sexually abused.
Nobody knew what was going on.

35
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,250
How do you,
by the time I was 14,

36
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:44,150
I was using whatever I
could get my hands on to,

37
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:48,860
to deal with the emotional turmoil
that I was dealing with inside. And,

38
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:53,480
um, when we're so young we have traumatic
events or we have these situations and

39
00:02:53,481 --> 00:02:58,481
these circumstances that stick with us
and we don't know how to process them.

40
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:03,190
So we reach out to whatever's
closest to is food addiction,

41
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,330
drug addiction.

42
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,470
Um,
I think it's,

43
00:03:08,471 --> 00:03:13,120
it's good to establish a distinction
between recreational use and habitual use

44
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,730
cause that's something I
heard you guys talking about.

45
00:03:15,731 --> 00:03:19,690
And I don't feel that people really
become emotionally dependent when they're

46
00:03:19,691 --> 00:03:22,720
recreationally using it.
When they're habitually using it,

47
00:03:22,721 --> 00:03:26,090
when they're using it to
solve problems, then it, it,

48
00:03:26,091 --> 00:03:29,350
it does become an issue because you're
not dealing with balance at that point.

49
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,420
I mean you're,
you're tipping one way and the scale,

50
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:34,060
you're clearly going to affect
other areas and get sick.

51
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,273
Okay.

52
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,360
I believe drugs are safe,
moderate

53
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:43,103
moderation.

54
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,970
I don't know what I think

55
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:55,380
actually I agree. I
think so. What's up guys?

56
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:59,850
This was the hard one for me. I just had
that hone in on that word moderation.

57
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:02,460
Like if I'm smoking once or twice a week,
that's fine.

58
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:04,680
But if I'm smoking every day of my life,

59
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:07,860
every second I get up and I
can't function then of, you know,

60
00:04:07,861 --> 00:04:09,960
of course that's when there's a red line.

61
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:13,570
I wouldn't say like using
things like heroin or cocaine,

62
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,900
like he's not a moderation.
I think that's just harmful.

63
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:20,490
But if we're talking about the subject
of marijuana and that use, then yeah,

64
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:22,890
yeah.

65
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:26,790
Well, here's why I disagree. I
think there are levels to this.

66
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:31,290
I don't think all drugs are safe,
even in moderation.

67
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:35,940
Like you take a wrong Molly or whatever
the Percocet pill is like, you know,

68
00:04:35,941 --> 00:04:40,440
like people have died from that and that
was technically in moderation. One pill,

69
00:04:40,441 --> 00:04:44,310
one day, life gone. You know,
like, same thing with heroin.

70
00:04:44,311 --> 00:04:48,090
Like that's something that could
drastically change your life in a day.

71
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:53,130
The moderation part of it is tough
because with pharmaceuticals mainly to me,

72
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:56,950
you mix two those things, you're
gone. And that's terrifying.

73
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,173
Yeah.

74
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:02,740
And there are so many circumstances
where it only takes one time to become

75
00:05:02,741 --> 00:05:05,710
physically dependent.
Even in, in my case, um,

76
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:08,890
I take prescription
medication for sleeping.

77
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:12,940
I hate that I'm on it and I hate
that I have to use it to function.

78
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:16,450
If you don't have to absolutely do it.
Why do it?

79
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:17,570
So let me ask you this though.

80
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:22,580
What's the distinction for you
between that and like Iowasca Pod Dmt?

81
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:26,060
Uh, the different, it's not necessary.

82
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:29,980
I think there's a distinction that I I'm
going to invite you to look at is like

83
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:33,980
there is a difference between cocaine.
Oh it was fine.

84
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,020
Hundred percent but what I'm
saying is neither are necessary.

85
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,070
My question to you is,

86
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,630
are you saying to all the young people
like you will not be able to open your

87
00:05:42,631 --> 00:05:45,270
mind fully unless you go and do this?

88
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:48,430
No. What I'm saying is
that I hold everybody, hi.

89
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,770
And I hold everybody with the
ability to think for themselves,

90
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:55,030
but also going out and having
an intentional, purposeful,

91
00:05:55,031 --> 00:06:00,031
responsible encounter with mushrooms
or LSD supported me in getting over my

92
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,880
addiction to marijuana and alcohol.

93
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:09,980
But the point being is the safety issue
and what you might have gone in that

94
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:14,220
moment when you took the drawings and
it opened her mind and you were able to

95
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,760
realize a lot of stuff I think people
should do on their own without them

96
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:19,653
drugs,

97
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:23,500
drugs,
reduce people's potential.

98
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,143
Okay.

99
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,770
I think even with psychedelic drugs,
you know, to the point earlier,

100
00:06:37,771 --> 00:06:42,330
even if they are opening your mind up,
that's really not your potential,

101
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:43,260
that's not your potential.

102
00:06:43,261 --> 00:06:47,340
Your potential is the organic potential
and a lot of your organic self is

103
00:06:47,341 --> 00:06:51,270
wonderful and it is marvelous and if you
take a little time to work and develop

104
00:06:51,271 --> 00:06:53,310
that muscle,
like a talent,

105
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:58,320
then you will be able to reach your
fullest potential. When I got sober,

106
00:06:58,321 --> 00:07:02,040
I went back to school, which I never
thought I would do. I work two jobs,

107
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:03,270
they started a small business,

108
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:07,080
like I think of all of the people who
are usually hypersensitive and end up

109
00:07:07,081 --> 00:07:11,550
getting into drugs because I can't deal
with our emotions and all those people

110
00:07:11,551 --> 00:07:16,110
could be potentially adding to society
and they're not because they're in their

111
00:07:16,111 --> 00:07:17,040
own world.

112
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,510
So I, I really don't feel that
they harm people's potential.

113
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:27,300
I think that helped people gain their
potential in a lot of different ways.

114
00:07:27,301 --> 00:07:28,770
And I mean with cannabis alone,
I mean,

115
00:07:28,771 --> 00:07:31,590
we have an endocannabinoid
system with our body. I mean,

116
00:07:31,591 --> 00:07:33,090
it's one of our main receptors.

117
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:36,300
It within our brain that it's
like a lock and key for cannabis.

118
00:07:36,301 --> 00:07:38,610
It's w are made at the same materials.

119
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:41,250
Our brains synthesizes
those materials within it.

120
00:07:41,251 --> 00:07:46,200
So I really do feel that our potential
isn't high hindered by drugs. I mean,

121
00:07:46,201 --> 00:07:50,910
some, it totally, I can see some a
hundred percent but overall natural ones,

122
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:51,780
not at all.

123
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:55,290
Some of the most powerful people in the
world right now in silicon valley and

124
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:58,440
creating some of the most powerful
startups are all microdosing. Oh, totally.

125
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:03,330
Two years ago I did, I had
my first mushroom experience.
So I went into the woods.

126
00:08:03,331 --> 00:08:05,640
I went in nature,
I set the intention,

127
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,640
I'm going to have this experience
and I've never had before.

128
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:13,850
It was a remarkable experience and I felt
a deeper truth within my connection to

129
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,490
the earth.
Something I hadn't had in a long time.

130
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:20,670
And it was kinda this
reconnection with my spirituality.

131
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:25,330
I can relate to you because I also
come from a very spiritual background.

132
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:28,780
I think wherever that framework
is for you, like if it's a drug,

133
00:08:28,781 --> 00:08:33,280
then that's for you. I think that's a
dangerous path. I also think that for me,

134
00:08:33,281 --> 00:08:36,040
that that thing is God.
You know,

135
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:40,270
like me having faith in God and
a relationship with God. That is,

136
00:08:40,271 --> 00:08:42,130
that is the opening to my spirituality.

137
00:08:42,131 --> 00:08:44,740
Like I don't need to
take drugs to get there.

138
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,240
Have you done psychedelics? No. So it,
it's, it's like someone that hasn't done,

139
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,620
had sex talking about,

140
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,790
no, it's not, that's not what it's
like at all. Like because how you,

141
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,380
the thing is is I don't need to
know. That's my point. My point is,

142
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:00,590
my point is you don't need
to know to have you do it.

143
00:09:00,591 --> 00:09:03,390
Do you have a relationship with Christ
and you know, have you spoken in tongues?

144
00:09:03,391 --> 00:09:06,250
None of the meaning. That's
a cross. That's not a
relationship. They're very dope.

145
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:10,920
Right. That is not a relationship.
The two are very different.

146
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:15,270
That's my point. So you don't have to ask
me what I did not do. What I said was,

147
00:09:15,271 --> 00:09:19,740
and I'll repeat it, my experience and
my relationship with Christ, for me,

148
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,920
that supersedes my desire to even go
into that path because I find myself very

149
00:09:25,111 --> 00:09:27,570
happy, very successful, buried.

150
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,450
I'm thriving within my being
and I don't need the stuff

151
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:32,343
to to,

152
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,360
there is a lot of false information
about recreational drugs.

153
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,353
Sorry,

154
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,200
everyone agree?
No one knows nothing.

155
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,760
It's like based on the culture,
the perception,

156
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:56,950
and I'm strictly talking about marijuana,
but you know,

157
00:09:56,951 --> 00:09:59,650
at one point in history it was
also used for medicine. It was,

158
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,410
it was used for religion.
It was used for, you know,

159
00:10:02,411 --> 00:10:05,400
for hip was used for a
variety of things like this.

160
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:08,230
And there's people that don't know
that it's a part of our history.

161
00:10:08,231 --> 00:10:13,060
So when I think about how ill informed
people are, that's one of the main things.

162
00:10:13,061 --> 00:10:13,510
But the truth,

163
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:16,960
there's like, do I really want all of the
information? I'll be honest. No I don't.

164
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,300
I don't, I don't really need it. You
don't. I agree with the statement.

165
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:22,050
That's why I walked over because
I will agree that like Vr,

166
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:25,800
there's a lot that I don't know
about recreational drugs. Um,

167
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:29,170
and I think that there's a lot
that most people don't know. Yeah.

168
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:31,540
I mean I walked over for that same thing.

169
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:36,220
I try and keep an open mind at all times
and realize that a wise man knows that

170
00:10:36,221 --> 00:10:39,550
he knows nothing,
especially with cannabis.

171
00:10:39,551 --> 00:10:42,340
And now I'm aware and have researched,
you know,

172
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:44,770
cannabis oils and taking
CBD and myself on.

173
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,150
I am interested in as someone who takes
pharmaceutical medication as cannabis as

174
00:10:49,151 --> 00:10:49,990
an alternative,

175
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:54,460
but my perspective and once again versus
recreational versus I would consider

176
00:10:54,461 --> 00:10:56,160
that for me medical use,

177
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:59,980
um, there's a great deal of
misinformation. I mean, just
like the pharmaceutical,

178
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:04,000
I mean we have all these things that are
getting pumped into our homes all the

179
00:11:04,001 --> 00:11:07,720
time with all of these side effects
and side effects and side effects.

180
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:10,150
More than half the commercial
is all side effects,

181
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,940
but yet it's telling you it's okay to
take that. It's cool to take that. Yeah,

182
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:16,850
it can probably kill you, but it's okay
to take that. But you can't take, yeah,

183
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,640
take this one and take this one,

184
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,860
but don't take this thing over
here that can actually help you.

185
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:21,803
Exactly.

186
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:26,640
I agree with that and I think that's
because there are people that benefit from

187
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:30,000
our equity, like us not being
literal about the subject.

188
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:32,030
I have to realize like why,

189
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:36,290
why we're here for this video is pushing
information and for recreational drug

190
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:38,330
purposes and like the misinformation.

191
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:42,590
But I think that it takes a lot more
education and usually a really bad

192
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,250
circumstance for you to want to change
around your life and be like, fuck,

193
00:11:46,251 --> 00:11:49,250
what am I doing?
Like there has to be more than this,

194
00:11:49,251 --> 00:11:52,880
but most people never get uncomfortable
enough to need to make that.

195
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:55,270
And so I'm,

196
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:59,410
I'm just not going to push it because I
just think that it's going to end up way

197
00:11:59,411 --> 00:12:01,120
more negative unfortunately.

198
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:08,330
Oh,

199
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:16,260
