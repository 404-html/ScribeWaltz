1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,170
I was in an abusive marriage and my father
yelled at me that I was going to hell

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,490
when I walked out. I'm sorry. I don't
believe in a god that would believe that.

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:09,353
Yeah.

4
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,590
Can I have all of my name?
Yes.

5
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,380
Hi.
One Pizza.

6
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:44,453
Okay.

7
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,290
You gotta be kidding.

8
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:53,490
My wife will not have a pizza
unless there's pineapple on it.

9
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,570
You can try anything on paper.
Yeah, why not? I'm going to,

10
00:00:57,571 --> 00:01:01,920
we're going to disagreers
Pete's pizza.

11
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,620
I like you tasted the cheese, the sauce
and the bread. That's it. It's like,

12
00:01:07,621 --> 00:01:08,251
it's like candy.

13
00:01:08,251 --> 00:01:13,251
That's like having candy on a
pizza is that it's like them.

14
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:25,120
I'm nervous about what's
going to happen today.

15
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:33,230
I mean I'm,
I'm,

16
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:37,200
I'm nervous because this is a normal
topic that people can usually talk about,

17
00:01:37,201 --> 00:01:42,201
but in this climate is very
touching me to even say I believe.

18
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:45,330
I don't believe, you know, it's funny.

19
00:01:45,331 --> 00:01:50,331
I would think that you would feel safer
in the belief category then I feel in

20
00:01:50,941 --> 00:01:55,500
the non belief category, I was raised
in a house very culturally Jewish.

21
00:01:55,501 --> 00:02:00,390
We talked a lot about God and religion
and many different religions of the

22
00:02:00,391 --> 00:02:01,920
world, but, um,

23
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:06,950
I wasn't raised with any faith with any
religious faith in the house just two

24
00:02:07,771 --> 00:02:11,130
years ago. I hated Christians.
I think I was an atheist,

25
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:16,190
but I voiced all my doubts and skepticisms
and they gave me their perspective on

26
00:02:16,411 --> 00:02:19,770
it. That kind of opened me up. And
that's why I'm a man of faith today.

27
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,680
I believe.

28
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:37,390
If I think, if I just choose to believe
that everyone is surely bad or evil,

29
00:02:37,391 --> 00:02:39,030
then that's going to be pretty.

30
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:42,670
And then you have to decide what
the definition of good it is.

31
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:46,120
According to Christianity, there
is no one good. No, not one.

32
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,820
But I don't necessarily
believe that if no one's good,

33
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:51,820
I don't want one with a sin
nature. Yeah. So that's hard.

34
00:02:51,821 --> 00:02:55,000
It's like my definition of good,
it made not align with scripture.

35
00:02:55,001 --> 00:02:58,240
So it's hard because that's why I
hesitated like I want to leave everybody's

36
00:02:58,241 --> 00:03:02,950
good. If antithetical to the
Christian belief is that you're born,

37
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:04,540
um,
it's sinful.

38
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:09,780
It's interesting that the three of
you came who are believers in that.

39
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,150
I'm not saying people are innately good.

40
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:18,440
I'm saying I just learned this other
question as all people are capable of.

41
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:23,330
Yeah,
no.

42
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,610
Start with Hitler and go from
there are people, you know,

43
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:30,670
are some people born good and turn bad?
Well,

44
00:03:30,671 --> 00:03:32,760
I think that's what the
definition of good is subjective,

45
00:03:32,761 --> 00:03:35,490
so that's why it's like the each to
each his own for definition and you just

46
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:35,931
kind of hard.

47
00:03:35,931 --> 00:03:39,570
I don't know what is right or wrong
without the Bible because it's gone,

48
00:03:39,571 --> 00:03:43,900
but it makes the rules really about God.
You have no rules.

49
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,980
You don't. You can't make a decision
on your own whether it's good or bad.

50
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,140
What about handler?
He made the decision.

51
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:53,380
I thought it was good and he was wrong.

52
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,470
You don't need the Bible to
tell you that. Well, you,

53
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,540
you're born with that God.

54
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:02,920
Put that in you as
conscious as you believed.

55
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,630
That's not a belief.
It's a fact.

56
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:11,580
I'm an author of two books where I give
the whole history of the earth from

57
00:04:11,581 --> 00:04:13,860
paleontology, geology, archaeology,

58
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:18,510
published about four articles on
numerous subjects, including politics,

59
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:21,900
science meaning Enix dinosaurs

60
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:33,230
to
my mother.

61
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,970
Yes, I would want people to think
that they have worth and value,

62
00:04:39,971 --> 00:04:44,500
but I mean we are all ants on a big boat.
We are all very important.

63
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:48,970
The design and those things.
If a man were to design it,

64
00:04:48,971 --> 00:04:52,960
it would cost several million dollars
to make a human if that were possible,

65
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:56,620
and yet he's,
God has created billions of us.

66
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:02,090
I believe in people.
I believe we make our own choices.

67
00:05:02,091 --> 00:05:07,091
I don't believe that there is a overriding
being controlling those choices are

68
00:05:08,001 --> 00:05:10,460
controlling our situation.
You are,

69
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:13,790
and I'm so,

70
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:18,260
I do not think that inherently just
existing gives you worth and value.

71
00:05:18,261 --> 00:05:19,820
I think that you make choices,

72
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:25,180
personal choices every single day on
how you live your life and how you treat

73
00:05:25,341 --> 00:05:30,341
people and how you exist
in the world and those,

74
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:34,140
well, hold on. You just made a
definition about what value is,

75
00:05:34,141 --> 00:05:37,260
but you still don't believe
you're valuable based on
your explanation. I said,

76
00:05:37,261 --> 00:05:39,960
I'm not inherently valuable to my being.

77
00:05:39,961 --> 00:05:44,580
Born does not just based
on your contribution to the
world determines your value.

78
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,400
Don't know.
Please don't.

79
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:54,890
There are many people who just exist
because of instinct or because do their

80
00:05:55,171 --> 00:05:59,330
lives have value. I don't know if
find value in it. Sure. If they don't,

81
00:05:59,331 --> 00:06:03,770
maybe not who, who am I to judge whether
somebody is life is inherently valuable

82
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,940
on the existence of a higher,
Huh?

83
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:18,470
I am a woman of faith and belief.

84
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:23,330
I believe in the supernatural and
higher power and a being that there's no

85
00:06:23,331 --> 00:06:25,310
accident and the way we were created.

86
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:28,930
Yeah. I think anytime I
have gone through hardship,

87
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:33,340
I've questioned not just what I believe.
I questioned my life.

88
00:06:33,341 --> 00:06:36,640
I questioned my profession, I
questioned my relationships. So yeah,

89
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:40,480
and I, I think you know, if you
believe whether it's Islam, Hindu,

90
00:06:40,481 --> 00:06:44,650
I think you have to die. You can't just
jump in there and be like, sign me up.

91
00:06:44,651 --> 00:06:46,000
I agree with everything.
Let's do it.

92
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:46,901
That would be for you.

93
00:06:46,901 --> 00:06:50,560
But nothing up for everybody that is
a believer of any particular religion.

94
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,480
People don't question anything.

95
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,110
But in your view by standing and saying,
you know,

96
00:06:55,111 --> 00:06:57,360
I don't think there's
any high power you do.

97
00:06:57,361 --> 00:07:00,270
Do you ever face any doubt of thinking?
Maybe there is.

98
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,500
Well, the definition of an atheist
is someone who does not believe.

99
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,770
It's not a declaration per
say that there is no god.

100
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:10,460
I am an atheist activist.

101
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:14,210
I'm on the board of atheists United
here in Los Angeles and on the steering

102
00:07:14,211 --> 00:07:17,540
committee for Americans United for
separation of church and state.

103
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:29,220
No, I've never had a doubt because
I can see design everywhere.

104
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:34,620
And you are not an atheist. You're an
agnostic. Nope. It's an agnostic. Now,

105
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,310
Leo told me what I am. I am an atheist.
An atheist doesn't. I am an atheist.

106
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,820
Atheist doesn't believe in
the supernatural period.

107
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,900
The atheist and agnostic. No. No. Does
believe the supernatural that does not.

108
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:50,640
He just doesn't believe in God.
I'm telling you what an atheist is.

109
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:55,470
No image,
healthiest supernatural.

110
00:07:55,471 --> 00:07:59,640
Do not tell me you don't need
to make anybody right or wrong.

111
00:07:59,641 --> 00:08:03,210
It's just answer the question. Give her
space to talk. Give her space to talk.

112
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:08,270
Do you believe that this line of
interrogation questioning furthers your,

113
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:11,550
no,
I'm just giving facts

114
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:15,160
saved by the bell.

115
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:19,260
I am feeling frustrated right now.

116
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:25,680
Yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm,

117
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:29,160
I'm feeling frustrated because it's
even amidst the fellow believers,

118
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:32,140
like the things he says, I'm
just like, Yo, I don't even know.

119
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:37,360
I don't want what he says to reflect what
my faith is to, you know what I mean?

120
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,730
I think it's sad

121
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:45,230
that people are so determined to make
other people wrong and I grew up in a

122
00:08:46,711 --> 00:08:47,610
household with it,

123
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:52,020
conservative Jewish mother and a born
again Christian father and I was in an

124
00:08:52,021 --> 00:08:56,520
abusive marriage and my father yelled at
me that I was to help when I walked out.

125
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:57,953
I'm sorry.

126
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:02,190
I don't believe in a God that would
believe that it's not and that is

127
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,840
objectively,
I don't care.

128
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:05,143
That's crazy.

129
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:13,720
Exactly. Kind of shuts down conversation.
Exactly what you believe in.

130
00:09:13,721 --> 00:09:14,980
Why White Dome?

131
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,160
Again, we have the power to
choose our response to things,

132
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:27,460
so I choose not to feel hurt.
I choose not to be misunderstood.

133
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:32,800
I think there's safety in being heard
and understood. You feel as if the,

134
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:36,270
whatever it is that you want
to be understood about matters.

135
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,160
I'm getting married in the next
two months that I'm learning

136
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:48,340
energy and effort to understand someone
who's different. I think, you know,

137
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,870
I think we're kind of as a society
and becoming lazy, so we're like, oh,

138
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,590
you're different. I don't
want to understand. I mean,

139
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:55,690
people who are just always been that,

140
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:08,000
oh look,
we all agree.

141
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,110
We all have room for it.

142
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:16,940
My aspiration on a daily basis
is to be a better person.

143
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:21,320
We're always learning. I used to
think at some point I would like Oh,

144
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:23,920
actual allies into, oh, I've made it,

145
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,380
made it into maturity and wisdom.
You know,

146
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:33,080
when I'm in college, I'll have it
figured out. When I get married,

147
00:10:33,081 --> 00:10:34,970
I'll have it figured out when I have kids.
I have it figured out,

148
00:10:34,971 --> 00:10:36,440
but we're always,

149
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:40,880
we won't reach perfection until
we get to heaven down here.

150
00:10:40,881 --> 00:10:44,200
As an imperfect world, we can,
our knowledge is imperfect.

151
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:48,980
Our bodies are in perfect. Our
world is perfect. I mean, I'm,

152
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,830
I'm agreeing with you,
but it's the delivery of it,

153
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:56,360
right? Let's stay up.
What was the question?

154
00:10:56,361 --> 00:10:59,510
We all believe that we have
room for improve, certainly.

155
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:09,290
All right. Alyssa, I acknowledge
you for keeping very,

156
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:14,291
very focused and not getting
ever heated but staying focused.

157
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:20,480
I appreciate your honesty and the way
you stand up for what you believe.

158
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:24,170
Nancy,
you have a presence of self.

159
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:28,210
You have a very still very centered
quality to you that is, um,

160
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,830
very admirable.
Christine,

161
00:11:30,831 --> 00:11:35,831
I acknowledge you for not running
out of the room when you were in a

162
00:11:36,471 --> 00:11:38,650
controversial conversation.
Um,

163
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:41,810
I acknowledge you for standing your
ground for believing what you believe and

164
00:11:41,811 --> 00:11:44,780
you've got a lot of
fight in you. Uh, Jeremy,

165
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:49,810
I acknowledge you for being unwaveringly
from and what you believe and not

166
00:11:51,681 --> 00:11:55,840
caring, whether it's controversial
or difficult to say what you believe.

167
00:11:56,230 --> 00:12:00,850
Um,
that is a sign of passion growing up.

168
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:05,150
I think you're a wonderful guy and your
marriage is going to make it grow even

169
00:12:05,151 --> 00:12:05,984
more.

170
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:12,780
You just seem like a very comfortable
guy who's willing to learn and grow and

171
00:12:13,631 --> 00:12:17,380
that's a lovely,
lovely quality and something Rissa.

172
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:22,740
You have this ability to take stock
of yourself and make decisions.

173
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,760
Like when you said, I choose not to be
heard and so I'm not hurt. It's just,

174
00:12:27,761 --> 00:12:29,880
it's an amazing quality in some,
thank you.

175
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:35,690
Nice to meet you. How are
we invited to the wedding?
