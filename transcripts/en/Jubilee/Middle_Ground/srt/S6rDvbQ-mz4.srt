1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,110
The phrase all lives matter was derived
from black lives matter to subvert black

2
00:00:04,111 --> 00:00:07,500
lives matter. And I won't come here
and sit down and say that that's okay.

3
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,440
And I have, I law enforcement
go to the left pool of life,

4
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:30,490
had my black lives matter orders
go to the right pool of light.

5
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,580
I regularly fear for my life.

6
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:42,963
Hmm.

7
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,930
You know, I'm an army
patrol officer, so I do.

8
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:52,050
We were responsive burglar alarms though.
If someone breaks into someone's house,

9
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:54,230
have a gun, I would have to
respond to that certain situation.

10
00:00:54,231 --> 00:00:55,680
So I do fear for my life in a way,

11
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,950
I guess you can say I do something
that I think every black man,

12
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:04,350
every black person in this country, many
people of color have been trained to do.

13
00:01:04,351 --> 00:01:08,430
And that's when the law enforcement
officer gets behind me and I'm driving.

14
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,670
I'm making sure I'm signaling,
I'm checking my speed.

15
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,540
I'm thinking of all the different
legitimate ways that you could stop me.

16
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:20,700
And in that moment I recognized and I
realize that I'm not a scholar with a

17
00:01:20,701 --> 00:01:23,310
bachelor's in political science,
a bachelor's in sociology,

18
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:25,890
a master's in public policy.
In that moment,

19
00:01:25,891 --> 00:01:30,891
I'm just another black man to
that officer and that scares me.

20
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:38,270
I,
I've maybe could have stepped forward.

21
00:01:38,271 --> 00:01:40,940
I feel scared for my
life when I'm at work.

22
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:43,820
Often when you get pulled over and all
the thoughts and things that are going

23
00:01:43,821 --> 00:01:46,160
through your mind. Well,
where when I pull a car over,

24
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,410
I'm thinking about where
I'm at on the highway,

25
00:01:48,411 --> 00:01:50,510
how I'm going to pull this vehicle over.
Did I run the plate?

26
00:01:50,511 --> 00:01:52,620
Did it come back to that vehicle?
Am I buckled in?

27
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,330
Might not buckled in because most officers
are shot and killed during traffic

28
00:01:56,331 --> 00:01:57,470
stops.
And as I approached,

29
00:01:57,471 --> 00:02:02,210
I put my hand on that car to leave my
hand print because if I'm shot and killed,

30
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:06,710
that person is further incriminated by
the evidence of my prints being on their

31
00:02:06,711 --> 00:02:07,220
car.

32
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:12,220
But I don't feel afraid for my life as
a citizen that at work I definitely do.

33
00:02:12,501 --> 00:02:13,334
And that's

34
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,300
the choice I made. I, I choose
not to live in fear. Uh,

35
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:21,030
if the question was do I feel less
safe now than I did five years ago,

36
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:21,960
I would say yes.

37
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:25,740
And I think that that's because we have
rampant social chaos that's expanding.

38
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,920
And I think that that's playing a large
role in a lot of the trends that we're

39
00:02:28,921 --> 00:02:33,780
seeing. What do you mean by social
chaos? Um, out of wedlock birth rates,

40
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:35,400
uh, statistically, you know,

41
00:02:35,401 --> 00:02:39,240
that sets a trial back five times more
likely to be poor in nine times more

42
00:02:39,241 --> 00:02:43,110
likely to drop out of school and 20
times more likely to end up in prison.

43
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:43,501
I mean,

44
00:02:43,501 --> 00:02:48,501
the cast that I'm seeing more recently
is white men walking into schools with ar

45
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,020
fifteens and slaughtering people.
Yeah.

46
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:55,770
And then w and then that is what you're
seeing and what you're not seeing is the

47
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,190
dozens of homicides that occur in
Chicago on a daily basis. And that

48
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,050
speaks to,
um,

49
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,680
certainly a media that's desirous to push
an agenda and a narrative that factual,

50
00:03:06,681 --> 00:03:10,990
he knows a bear out there is a massive
disparity between black crime and white

51
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:12,040
crime and large.

52
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,060
And obviously that's going to lead
to accelerated interactions with law

53
00:03:16,061 --> 00:03:19,990
enforcement. This specific, the
criminalization of black people.

54
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:23,860
When you have more police officers
patrolling a concentrated area,

55
00:03:23,861 --> 00:03:27,640
then of course you have more
stops. You have more, you know,

56
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:29,770
situations where police officers say,
oh,

57
00:03:29,771 --> 00:03:34,420
they didn't signal and then when I pulled
them over I pulled all occupants out

58
00:03:34,421 --> 00:03:36,190
of the car.
I searched the car,

59
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:40,570
I found this gun allegedly
buried somewhere and all
of a sudden now you have a

60
00:03:40,571 --> 00:03:44,500
crime as a public defender.
The the reputation is that you know,

61
00:03:44,501 --> 00:03:46,240
I'm going to lose most of my cases.

62
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:49,840
I have one far more
cases than I have lost.

63
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,240
My name is Elissa Blair.
I am African American.

64
00:03:54,241 --> 00:03:57,720
I'm also a criminal defense attorney.
As a public defender,

65
00:03:57,721 --> 00:04:00,690
I've seen the mistreatment of my clients.

66
00:04:00,691 --> 00:04:05,691
I see the disproportionate incarceration
of black and brown people and I see the

67
00:04:06,481 --> 00:04:08,130
excessive force used in arrests.

68
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,170
Police should be given more resources.

69
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:23,760
I think police should definitely be given
more resources so that they have other

70
00:04:23,761 --> 00:04:26,160
options besides killing people.

71
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:31,340
Officers should have the resources
available to them to handle a situation

72
00:04:32,131 --> 00:04:34,500
without casualty on either side.

73
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,330
Yeah, I mean, as an officer I,

74
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,890
I appreciate hearing that from a member
of the public and from a public defender

75
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:46,600
and can speak to it for myself and my
department and what I've seen in other

76
00:04:46,601 --> 00:04:50,590
departments in the area and know that we
need more resources and different types

77
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:51,340
of training,

78
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:56,230
communication techniques to deescalate
situations and different types of least

79
00:04:56,231 --> 00:05:00,760
force option techniques.
But as a small woman,

80
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,870
I also want to be able to
physically protect myself and it's,

81
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,210
it's a hard balance.

82
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:14,120
The largest expense for almost every
municipality and county is public safety.

83
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:18,230
There's plenty of money, but we don't
have is enough implicit bias training.

84
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:23,060
The things that we carry about ourselves
that define how we interpret who we're

85
00:05:23,061 --> 00:05:24,440
interacting with,
our judgment.

86
00:05:24,441 --> 00:05:29,210
We don't have enough contextualizing
of the communities that you're serving.

87
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:32,480
Draw officers from the
communities from which they serve.

88
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:36,620
That way when they go back and they
are policing their own community,

89
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:39,300
that's deeper than just
the race of the officer.

90
00:05:39,301 --> 00:05:43,400
So you think that black police officers
need to be trained to be more sensitive

91
00:05:43,401 --> 00:05:45,140
to the black communities?
That what you're saying? No,

92
00:05:45,141 --> 00:05:48,440
I think black officers that are policing
black community should come from those

93
00:05:48,441 --> 00:05:49,274
communities.

94
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:52,670
And I think a white officer who comes
from that community might even be more

95
00:05:52,671 --> 00:05:55,010
effective than a black
officer from somewhere else.

96
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:58,610
I agree. And I think, I think that this is
a great point, which is that an officer,

97
00:05:58,611 --> 00:06:02,450
a white officer, a black officer, a
female officer, a Hispanic officer,

98
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,940
could be just as good
as any other or better.

99
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:08,090
And that's because there are
things other than skin color.

100
00:06:08,091 --> 00:06:12,950
And I think that what's so concerning
amount this dialogue is that it is pushing

101
00:06:12,951 --> 00:06:16,970
us further back into black communities,
white communities.

102
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,760
When really I thought that the
goal of Martin Luther King,

103
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:23,630
what does that we're going to be moving
to a society where we were being judged

104
00:06:23,631 --> 00:06:24,950
by the content of our character.

105
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:28,820
If we keep moving further into
identifying based on our groups,

106
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:31,280
I think that we're doing a
disservice to his message,

107
00:06:31,281 --> 00:06:34,970
which I think was very powerful.
And that United the country in many ways,

108
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:39,920
but not at the time in Martin Luther
King's time. White folks hated him.

109
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,810
It causes me to Bristle.

110
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,580
And and have an emotional reaction
whenever somebody says, you know,

111
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:51,230
black people are killing folks 50% and
violent crimes and then says Martin

112
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:52,063
Luther King United the country,

113
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:55,250
Martin Luther King would be
down for black lives matter

114
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,230
the next day.
It is,

115
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:01,690
I believe that all lives matter.

116
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:14,670
It's a little bit surprising
below all of this stuff,

117
00:07:14,671 --> 00:07:16,620
below skin deeper than all of this,

118
00:07:16,621 --> 00:07:20,370
there is a intrinsic God given life
that's put inside of all of us.

119
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,300
I think that it's concerning that any
movement would reject the fundamental

120
00:07:24,301 --> 00:07:28,850
premise of that while preaching for
quality. Exactly. At that point,

121
00:07:28,851 --> 00:07:31,920
and you're really not in a
quality movement if you're
really only interested in

122
00:07:31,921 --> 00:07:33,570
speaking to your specific group.

123
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,950
I truly believe in,
I agree with everything that you say.

124
00:07:36,951 --> 00:07:40,460
Everyone deserves life and I believe
that, you know, life is a gift.

125
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,210
Plain and simple, all life
counts. It's all life matters.

126
00:07:44,211 --> 00:07:45,320
All life deserves a chance.

127
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,233
No.

128
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:49,911
Yeah.

129
00:07:49,911 --> 00:07:54,410
I think that especially in this platform
but also in the world and the country

130
00:07:54,411 --> 00:07:57,740
that we live in today,
stating that all lives mattered,

131
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:01,940
takes away from the inequality
that's happening in the world.

132
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,830
Of course all lives matter.

133
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:09,040
It negates the fact that something has
to be addressed and if you don't address

134
00:08:09,411 --> 00:08:14,360
it and you don't recognize that there
is a problem that has to be changed,

135
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:18,410
then you never fucking change it.
That's not our intention.

136
00:08:18,411 --> 00:08:20,920
Our intention was just to answer
a simple question, but it's not.

137
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:23,990
Not Everything is the same and
not everything is the same.

138
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:28,830
You all lives matter. If you asked
me if all lives have intrinsic value,

139
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:32,400
if all lives are valuable,
if all lives are worthy,

140
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:35,970
I would have said hell yes it would
have been the first one in my chair.

141
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:41,180
All lives matter is a specific phrase
similar to blue lives matter and anything

142
00:08:42,571 --> 00:08:46,510
else that mattered after black lives
were exclaimed to have mattered to the

143
00:08:46,511 --> 00:08:49,260
track,
to appropriate,

144
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:53,520
to subvert the message in the framing
and the narrative that's being brought to

145
00:08:53,521 --> 00:08:55,560
us by the black lives matter movement.

146
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:59,730
So I don't think anybody here in this
room thinks that any life is less worthy

147
00:08:59,731 --> 00:09:00,330
than another's.

148
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:04,580
But the phrase all lives matter was
derived from black lives matter to subvert

149
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:08,130
black lives matter. And I won't come here
and sit down and say that. That's okay.

150
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:11,500
I mean I feel like we're just
kind of going into the weeds here.

151
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:13,510
Question was in the black lives
matter is a simple question.

152
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:14,890
Do you believe that all lives matter?

153
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:17,940
I don't think that that's an
interesting phrase. A phrase.

154
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:21,190
I think that you frequently,
I think not really.

155
00:09:21,191 --> 00:09:25,990
I think that you can attach
it right after. That's what
I try and step back from,

156
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:29,620
you know, whatever sort of identity,
political stuff we have going on.

157
00:09:29,621 --> 00:09:31,940
And I try and deal with things
head on based on reality.

158
00:09:31,941 --> 00:09:34,480
And when someone says to meet,
do you think all lives matter?

159
00:09:34,481 --> 00:09:38,170
I answer unequivocably yes.
Every time. The same way.

160
00:09:38,171 --> 00:09:41,110
If you asked me a black lives
matter or female lives matter,

161
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:44,710
I will answer the same way you do.
Black lives matter. Yes they do.

162
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:50,190
I had conflicting feelings
about coming here today.

163
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,223
Yeah.

164
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,360
For me,
I was conflicted because I,

165
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,200
I don't feel like I should
speak for black oppression,

166
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:05,950
but as a white woman,
um,

167
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:11,370
I think that I can be a value to other
white people who may not understand.

168
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,850
I'm Sandra crews and well,

169
00:10:13,851 --> 00:10:18,320
I'm from the 60s and I went to jail a lot
for fighting for women's rights and as

170
00:10:18,321 --> 00:10:19,250
a human being,

171
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:23,270
I think it's important that I speak
out and speak up for injustices.

172
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:29,270
I'm feeling conflicted now as someone who
steps into the law enforcement side as

173
00:10:30,781 --> 00:10:33,660
if we are on opposite sides.
Um,

174
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:37,440
I am a law enforcement officer and
a black lives matter supporter.

175
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:42,860
I find myself searching for what
to do and how to make a difference.

176
00:10:43,381 --> 00:10:46,380
And I've had moments of thinking
about leaving the force.

177
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:50,790
I finally had a realization that this
gives me an opportunity to have a

178
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:55,791
different angle as a white woman and
also as a police officer to potentially

179
00:10:57,181 --> 00:10:59,970
make a difference even if it's
just with changing myself.

180
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,100
I didn't hesitate.

181
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:08,790
I've been a civilian my entire life
and I consider it an honor to have an

182
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:11,700
opportunity to provide
voice for law enforcement.

183
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,800
And the men and women that
serve our communities.

184
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:18,470
I think it's fundamentally important for
society to respect law enforcement men

185
00:11:18,471 --> 00:11:23,030
and women that serve our communities
with tremendous honor and distinction end

186
00:11:23,031 --> 00:11:26,090
up getting a bad rap.
I think that that's very harmful.

187
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,060
I think that it is important.

188
00:11:29,061 --> 00:11:34,061
I think it's imperative to speak
whenever you have an opportunity to,

189
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:39,380
and I think that all of us in whatever
movements were part of or whatever belief

190
00:11:39,381 --> 00:11:42,440
systems were part of should use our gifts.

191
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:48,050
You know deescalation training is sitting
in a room like this with a PowerPoint

192
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:51,710
and walking officers' through
scenarios and nothing.

193
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:56,600
Nothing in a scenario is ever going
to be like the real world in defensive

194
00:11:56,630 --> 00:12:01,540
officer's like only those of us that
walk in the shoes of having a badge and a

195
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:05,470
gun and being in these high stress
situations can really articulate what it's

196
00:12:05,471 --> 00:12:09,970
like to make these split second decisions
with our training officers need to be

197
00:12:09,971 --> 00:12:13,300
in these types of discussions.
Owning their shit and being like,

198
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,280
I did this wrong and I have this prejudice
and how can I sit with people who can

199
00:12:18,281 --> 00:12:21,310
teach me and change me?

200
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:24,800
This is what I think is sort of
dangerous about a conversation like this.

201
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:28,100
Is that really the only thing that I
want law enforcement being trained on is

202
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:30,230
the law. Okay. Um,

203
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,030
this nebulous conversation about thinking
about how I think about things and

204
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:35,200
yeah,

205
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,650
some of us in law enforcement think of
ourselves as social workers with a gun.

206
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,420
And that's concerning because your,

207
00:12:40,421 --> 00:12:45,370
your job is to enforce the law as
someone in the field who wants more

208
00:12:45,371 --> 00:12:46,750
deescalation training.

209
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:51,940
It's not because I don't believe in a
lot of the laws that I enforce and it is

210
00:12:51,941 --> 00:12:55,510
my job to enforce the law.
I'm not allow warning officer,

211
00:12:55,511 --> 00:12:57,250
that's not what I signed up to do.

212
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:01,870
But we are given the
discretion to make choices.

213
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:07,030
And that's why we need more
training because we're human beings.

214
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:08,530
Just in my perspective,

215
00:13:08,531 --> 00:13:12,910
and I appreciate your support of law
enforcement and your perspective.

216
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:15,530
Yeah. And I and I appreciate
your perspective as well as your,

217
00:13:15,531 --> 00:13:19,370
your real service that you've done so and
I don't want it. We are disagreements.

218
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:23,300
Certainly don't take away from my
respect and admiration for your service.

219
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:24,010
Let's thank you for this.

220
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:29,010
We all respect the service of everyone
who works to the service of others.

221
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:35,150
I don't think anybody in this room
is against individual officers.

222
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:40,240
The conversation is to take a step back
and recognize that this institution is a

223
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:46,541
relic of Anglo policing from European
culture but also slave catching and deep

224
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:53,861
rooted racism in American policy and we
need to take that step back and re sent

225
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,880
to this conversation on the fact that
it's bigger than just an officer.

226
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:03,180
I think part of the problem is
that we're still so segregated.

227
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:06,150
Where do we go to have
these conversations?

228
00:14:06,151 --> 00:14:10,140
Where do we go to learn from each
other to break down the stereotypes?

229
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:15,320
It's systemic and I'm so thrilled that
there's a black lives matter movement.

230
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:18,300
It's really exciting.

231
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,910
Guys. Thank you so much. I know
this hasn't been an easy one,

232
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:26,310
but I appreciate your time.
Feel free to continue the discussion.

233
00:14:26,311 --> 00:14:27,980
If you'd like outside.
Yeah.

234
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,010
It's a pleasure.

235
00:14:33,011 --> 00:14:36,040
I really appreciate you speaking your
truth and in here and mine as well.

236
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:40,150
I really appreciate all of you
guys. Okay? Yeah. Hey guys,
