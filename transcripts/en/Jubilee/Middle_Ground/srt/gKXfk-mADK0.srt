1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,080
I've heard people say, well,
we only had anal sex. So

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:04,143
delivery time,

3
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:19,510
I'm done.

4
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:24,020
Kat Graham and I am a sexual and
spiritual activists and author,

5
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:28,640
a sex and intimacy guide for couples and
individuals and a meditation teacher.

6
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:30,200
Uh,
I'm Lance,

7
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,130
I'm a bartender by night and I work
in the entertainment industry by day.

8
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,630
I'm Katie.

9
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:40,910
I worked in TV and film
up until two years ago.

10
00:00:40,911 --> 00:00:44,510
I've been living there mom
and married life. I'm grace.

11
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:48,860
I'm 25 years old and I'm a nanny and
the day and then a bartender at night.

12
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,060
I'm Christina,

13
00:00:50,061 --> 00:00:54,860
I'm 34 and I'm an actor and
also a youth leader in ministry.

14
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:59,690
I'm Brandon. I am 23 years old. I work
in social media. So like in marketing

15
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:07,930
I have not had
outside nightmare.

16
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,300
Um, that is a true statement. Yes.

17
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,580
And I did clarify like I
have not had sex in general,

18
00:01:22,581 --> 00:01:26,900
so I feel like that went with the prompt.
Cool. Just making sure. Um, you know,

19
00:01:26,901 --> 00:01:30,710
I grew up in the church and so I was
a typical like not going to have sex,

20
00:01:30,711 --> 00:01:33,350
not going to do a B through z.
Um,

21
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:36,920
I just got out of a two and a half
year relationship coming out of it.

22
00:01:36,921 --> 00:01:41,420
I'm so much more empathetic to how
absolutely tough it is on a day to day.

23
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,350
Yeah.
I,

24
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:47,350
I did not have sex prior to getting
married almost three years ago.

25
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:50,150
It made me test.

26
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,300
If this wasn't a serious
relationship going somewhere,

27
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:56,180
then I could just focus on
kind of my other things.

28
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:58,893
Okay.

29
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:01,320
Brandon, I'm curious, um,

30
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,940
the way in which you engaged with your
sexuality and your two and a half year

31
00:02:04,941 --> 00:02:07,010
relationship,
were there things that you could do?

32
00:02:07,011 --> 00:02:11,570
Were there certain things you couldn't
do and is having an orgasm with somebody

33
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,150
considered not being abstinent?

34
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:18,650
Um, first of all, to act like we didn't
do anything. I'd be lying to you.

35
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,720
I was like,
I'm just purified angel.

36
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:25,980
Like that there's a white sheet is just
a lie and that's just being up front is

37
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,000
I want to preface with,
is that okay?

38
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:31,760
I never want to minimize
sin and how I view that.

39
00:02:31,761 --> 00:02:33,110
I never want to run away from that.

40
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:37,400
Sin is a very heavy thing
and unfortunately for a lot
of things we'd be fighting

41
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:39,410
and maybe like getting,
doing physical things,

42
00:02:39,411 --> 00:02:43,940
it was easier to either numb
that or to make that fight. Ed,

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,360
you know like I'm so mad at you right
now, I don't want to be mad. Boom,

44
00:02:47,361 --> 00:02:49,400
something happens physically.
Right. And then we're like,

45
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:52,850
I guess we're calling out the
whole orgasms sex thing. Right?

46
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,760
Like that's a thing I still wrestle with.
I don't know.

47
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,320
I don't have a blanket
wide answer for you.

48
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,910
I still danced in the gray area there,

49
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:03,310
but I know that in my relationship it
was used sometimes it's a beautiful thing

50
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:06,310
where like it was a natural thing of
love and passion and just being attracted

51
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:08,340
to each other. But then there
was also times where it wasn't

52
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:11,560
a lot of things. We can say sex
is like, I've heard people say,

53
00:03:11,561 --> 00:03:16,300
well we only had anal sex so I'm still
a virgin. And to me that's like Whoa,

54
00:03:16,301 --> 00:03:20,380
like regular, like just
regular intercourse, you know,

55
00:03:20,381 --> 00:03:25,210
before I did that. So, but that's me.
Like you're more not a virgin than me.

56
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:32,830
Yes, I have had sex outside of
marriage in a committed relationship.

57
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:38,080
Did I want to wait? Absolutely.
The love is a powerful thing.

58
00:03:38,081 --> 00:03:43,081
And when love comes in it
blind a lot and wanted to say,

59
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:47,980
hey, let's just take this
time and if we're going to
get married, let's just wait.

60
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:50,230
And we weren't on the same
page when it came to that.

61
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:52,360
So when that relationship ended,

62
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:57,070
I made a vow to God and myself to wait.

63
00:03:57,071 --> 00:04:02,071
So I do consider myself a born again
virgin and I'll enjoy sex in marriage like

64
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:07,780
10 times more than I did outside of it. I
have heard, you know, my whole life, oh,

65
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:10,270
sex before marriage is a sin.
But then you know,

66
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,070
murdering someone is always a sin.
Right.

67
00:04:12,071 --> 00:04:16,120
But why is sex before marriage after
marriage? It's not a Senate anymore. Yeah,

68
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:19,850
it's just because you have a piece of
paper saying, Oh, we're married, you know,

69
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,130
now we can have sex.
So I kind of,

70
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:26,070
I agree with you. We make a big deal
about it being between God and the,

71
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,190
that's the whole reason that
you're abstaining. So why,

72
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:31,610
why does this,

73
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:36,020
people are like some kind
of consensus being involved,

74
00:04:36,021 --> 00:04:40,850
like make it valid now they don't bring
validity like it still is between you

75
00:04:40,851 --> 00:04:41,950
and another person in God.

76
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:47,130
My first time was a positive experience.

77
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,200
My first time was with my
first serious girlfriend, uh,

78
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,180
towards the end of high school.

79
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:07,990
Disorganized and messy and
um, silly at times. Uh,

80
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,770
but I look back on it really fondly and
we were losing our virginity is together,

81
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:15,770
which I think was a really
nice thing to share.

82
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:20,920
I lost my virginity and like one of
my first longterm relationships also,

83
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,880
we were both virgins,

84
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:26,900
which is good cause like neither of
us know what we were really doing. Um,

85
00:05:26,901 --> 00:05:29,630
so that was, it was awkward,
but it was, it was positive.

86
00:05:29,631 --> 00:05:31,640
I mean I always went into it thinking,
oh,

87
00:05:31,641 --> 00:05:34,940
the first time I have sex it's going
to hurt. It's going to be so bad.

88
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:39,050
My Heart's going to feel so sad that
I'm, you know, I'm not married and stuff,

89
00:05:39,051 --> 00:05:42,370
but I felt none of that.
I was like, this is great.

90
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,020
Yeah.
My first time was hilarious.

91
00:05:45,021 --> 00:05:50,021
I was almost 28 years old and have
still a virgin on our wedding night.

92
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:53,600
So the honeymoon it got a lot better.

93
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:54,980
You know,

94
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:59,980
argument used so much against abstinence
and celibacy is that how do you know

95
00:06:00,501 --> 00:06:03,770
what you're doing? How do you like,
you're not going to be trained.

96
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,350
I think there's a cool part of learning
that process with each other and

97
00:06:06,351 --> 00:06:10,610
learning that with one person and I think
that's just something that helps you

98
00:06:10,611 --> 00:06:12,200
appreciate it.
Love that person more.

99
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:17,300
And my first time having sex
was not a negative experience.

100
00:06:17,301 --> 00:06:19,130
It just wasn't necessarily
a positive experience.

101
00:06:19,131 --> 00:06:23,330
I was 14 and I just
decided I had to do it.

102
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:27,650
I had sex in the back of a hot
rod car with a guy who was,

103
00:06:27,651 --> 00:06:30,350
I think about 18 the way
in which it was positive.

104
00:06:30,351 --> 00:06:35,351
Now when I look back on it is that I
started young and I had a lot of colorful

105
00:06:35,961 --> 00:06:38,540
experiences. Some of them
positive, some of them negative,

106
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:43,520
but now I'm able to take
all of that experience and
use it to help other people.

107
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:45,830
Sex,

108
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:48,370
it can be just physical.

109
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:56,620
Great.

110
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:00,030
Okay. Um, I do think it
can just be physical.

111
00:07:00,031 --> 00:07:04,110
I've had sex with people that I've,
I mean,

112
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,580
they were cool,

113
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:09,450
but like I wasn't interested in
anything else other than sex.

114
00:07:09,451 --> 00:07:12,710
And then that was it. And you know,
they go on and I go on and it was fine.

115
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:17,230
It's definitely for me personally been
something that has been just physical at

116
00:07:17,231 --> 00:07:21,700
times, um, both in and out
of committed relationships.

117
00:07:21,701 --> 00:07:23,530
I think that's a really
important point to make that,

118
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:28,510
that sometimes it can
be used as a tool or a,

119
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,850
you know, or as just a, a way to,

120
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:34,990
to blow off steam after a hard day or
something that just doesn't require a

121
00:07:34,991 --> 00:07:38,290
deeper connection every time.
Um,

122
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:44,310
reiterate by almost always prefer it
when there is a deeper connection.

123
00:07:44,321 --> 00:07:46,120
It definitely enhances the experience.

124
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:47,693
Yeah.

125
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:51,783
Uh,
happen.

126
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:56,950
So I think that sex can be physical
from someone's own thought process,

127
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:04,460
but I think you still do, you know,
that there's an emotional side to it.

128
00:08:04,461 --> 00:08:08,180
And so even sometimes I just have friends
that I know, I know that have said,

129
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:12,170
yeah, this is just sex for me too, you
know? But that's not truly how they feel.

130
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:16,460
A lot of the time it does mean something
more or they are hoping that it turns

131
00:08:16,461 --> 00:08:17,570
into something more

132
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:21,430
with that. But I would also say
there's the polyamory community.

133
00:08:21,431 --> 00:08:24,160
There's the swinger community,
there's the kink community,

134
00:08:24,161 --> 00:08:26,320
there's the just sex positive community.

135
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:30,010
There's people who go to sex parties
every weekend and just have fun with each

136
00:08:30,011 --> 00:08:30,400
other.

137
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,550
I think there are a lot of communities
that you just might not be a part of

138
00:08:33,551 --> 00:08:38,551
where sex just for sacs is actually a
very normal accepted and positive thing,

139
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,590
then that's fine and well.

140
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:45,550
But I do believe that when two people
are connected in an intimate way,

141
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:49,450
a soul tie is connected.
And when you are about to enter,

142
00:08:49,451 --> 00:08:54,160
it says another relationship or enter
into something new you're carrying someone

143
00:08:54,161 --> 00:08:58,860
else with. It's like a, it's like a web
that's being weaved into someone else.

144
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:02,010
It's an emotional attachment.
Um, but to some people,

145
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,520
I do think that they can,
it can just be,

146
00:09:05,521 --> 00:09:08,490
I guess a one and done thank you next,
whatever.

147
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:12,420
But I do believe that you're carrying
a soul tie when you're physically and

148
00:09:12,421 --> 00:09:15,240
sexually. Um, connect.

149
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:20,360
I've been shamed for my sexual choices.

150
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,713
Okay.

151
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,890
Yeah, I've been shamed on both sides
cause I grew up in the church too.

152
00:09:31,891 --> 00:09:36,300
And when I was not having sex,
I was shamed by my friends that were,

153
00:09:36,301 --> 00:09:38,100
and then once I started having sex,

154
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:42,480
I was shamed by people who were in the
church who weren't having sex. Yeah. Yeah.

155
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:45,830
It's crazy on either side. I think
you're just going to get shamed, uh,

156
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,380
depending on the kind of people and the
communities that are in your life at

157
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:50,040
that point in time.

158
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:54,090
There is that aspect of
it, of being shamed for not
doing it right. And you know,

159
00:09:54,091 --> 00:09:57,760
I work at a place where I am one of very
few believers in my company and people

160
00:09:57,761 --> 00:10:01,020
would be like, you don't sleep with
your girl. Come on Bro. You know?

161
00:10:01,021 --> 00:10:04,020
And I've had that in that feeling
of like that pressure of like,

162
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:06,750
am I supposed to be like,
would that make it easier?

163
00:10:06,751 --> 00:10:09,420
Would my relationship be better?
And like, and you started going to,

164
00:10:09,421 --> 00:10:13,180
is it worth the shame from the church?
Is that worth it? Like, and you know,

165
00:10:13,181 --> 00:10:14,630
and that's,
and that's a constant battle.

166
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:19,700
I always loved sex and I had a lot of sex
when I was a teenager and I definitely

167
00:10:19,701 --> 00:10:22,550
had comments like, Oh,
Jessica have sex with anyone.

168
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:24,680
And that wasn't really the case.
Um,

169
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:27,710
but I definitely got comments like that
and it never really bothered me. I would,

170
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,640
I was always just like, oh, well,
screw you. You know, we're not going,

171
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:34,850
not going to have sex with you. Now
that you said that. Now in my life,

172
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,600
I get a lot of different attitudes just
based on the way I put myself out there.

173
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:43,430
But I do treat it as activism because
I think that by speaking out and being

174
00:10:43,431 --> 00:10:47,270
willing to deal with the shame as well
as all the Dick pics and propositions,

175
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:51,440
I constantly get online. I mean, as part
of the, I think of it as part of the job,

176
00:10:51,441 --> 00:10:53,270
you know,
but it's really important.

177
00:10:53,271 --> 00:10:57,320
And so I'm willing to have
people project their own shame.

178
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:01,530
Uh,

179
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:02,400
just real quick,

180
00:11:02,401 --> 00:11:06,690
I want to say a one thing I noticed right
off the bat being the only one on the

181
00:11:06,691 --> 00:11:11,691
outside is that I'm certain
that it ties into my privilege.

182
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:15,330
I think in my experience,
in terms of my parents and things,

183
00:11:15,331 --> 00:11:18,570
it's been more cautionary
and certainly from a caring,

184
00:11:18,571 --> 00:11:20,850
loving place and I haven't felt any shame.

185
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,020
Yeah.

186
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:25,560
Sex Ed should encourage safe sex

187
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,650
over abstinence.

188
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,353
I want to run.

189
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:36,883
Yeah,

190
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:43,140
yeah.
Over abstinence.

191
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:46,180
Ah, yeah. I'm just going
to go sit down. Welcome.

192
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:52,220
The reason why I chose to sit is because
although I'm pro abstinence and I'm

193
00:11:54,431 --> 00:11:58,660
salvage, uh, education is education.
Kids are going to make their own choices.

194
00:11:58,661 --> 00:12:01,870
There's free will. They're going to act
on impulse, they're going to act on love,

195
00:12:01,871 --> 00:12:05,050
they're going to act on
whatever's present to them,

196
00:12:05,051 --> 00:12:08,350
and if you don't educate them on
the safest way to go about that,

197
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:12,670
how are they going to learn? I don't
believe it should be over apps, Vince,

198
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:17,700
but I do agree that it's a big
part of education for sure.

199
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:19,091
Having choice.

200
00:12:19,091 --> 00:12:23,620
I think actually in some ways works for
the abstinence folks because it's like

201
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,560
if you don't, if it's this bad
thing that you shouldn't do,

202
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:28,450
then of course kids are
going to want to do it.

203
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:32,800
And so I think like by just giving all
the information and offering choices,

204
00:12:32,801 --> 00:12:35,110
then you know,
people can make a choice.

205
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:36,961
Yeah.

206
00:12:36,961 --> 00:12:40,050
So I think you guys addressed a lot and
I think when it comes to the education,

207
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:43,770
because knowledge is power,
we have to teach kids why it is not,

208
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,040
don't do this or God hates you.
It's not that it should be,

209
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:49,020
we love God.

210
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:53,490
God sent his son who gave us the ultimate
sacrifice and so we are sacrificing a

211
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:56,070
physical thing that we
are naturally drawn to.

212
00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:01,730
I disagreed because I think
it your painting just a one
side of something that's

213
00:13:04,111 --> 00:13:07,620
really important, you know, and it's the
safety side, but there should also be,

214
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,300
if you feel like it's meaningful to you,

215
00:13:09,301 --> 00:13:14,301
you should definitely wait until you're
excited about doing this and here's the

216
00:13:14,311 --> 00:13:15,270
safe way to do it.

217
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:20,330
I still see an imbalance where now it's
becoming taboo to talk about the option

218
00:13:22,381 --> 00:13:23,214
of purity.

219
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:28,250
My desire is that we don't allow them
the next generation to think that sex is

220
00:13:28,591 --> 00:13:33,230
completely meaningless and
has no emotion or feeling or,

221
00:13:33,231 --> 00:13:36,480
or reason. You know, I think
everyone has their own journey.

222
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,010
Uh, waiting is not mine, but you know,
it could, it's yours and that's awesome.

223
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:45,120
So, um, yeah, just being
accepting of everyone's sexuality,

224
00:13:45,121 --> 00:13:48,150
whether it be super high
or nonexistent at all. Um,

225
00:13:48,151 --> 00:13:52,170
and just being open to listening to
other people's opinions. All right.

226
00:13:52,171 --> 00:13:53,220
That's a wrap.

227
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,990
Oh
my God.

228
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:02,780
I'm so glad I pursued in everything here.
