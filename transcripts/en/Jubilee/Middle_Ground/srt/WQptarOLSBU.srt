1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,610
I wish there was just more compassion.
No,

2
00:00:02,611 --> 00:00:05,670
we don't want to make something difficult.
We just want to be acknowledged.

3
00:00:05,671 --> 00:00:08,820
My daughter was a victim
and she's being punished.

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:10,953
Okay.

5
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:22,990
Hi,

6
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:26,380
my name is Marissa gold. I am
a parent. I have two girls,

7
00:00:26,381 --> 00:00:31,150
10 and 13 and I'm also a parenting
expert with my own parenting company,

8
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:32,410
intuit parenting.

9
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:36,340
My Name is David Epstein and I'm a
pediatric intensive care physician.

10
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,370
I'm Gary Schlepper.
I'm an internal medicine physician.

11
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,040
I'm Bob Sears.
I'm a pediatrician.

12
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,850
I guess my greatest passion is
just to help encourage a full,

13
00:00:45,851 --> 00:00:48,700
complete informed
consent for vaccinations.

14
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:52,640
Awesome. Marissa? By
trade, I'm a designer.

15
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:56,420
I am also an activist and a mother.

16
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,600
I'm Melissa Floyd and I would consider
myself an informed consent advocate.

17
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:05,390
I just want to make sure this conversation
can be open for people and continue

18
00:01:05,391 --> 00:01:09,520
to inform people and to listen to everyone
to understand why we each come to our

19
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:10,373
opinion on this.

20
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:16,880
First statement is I am vaccinated,

21
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,600
so I actually wasn't fully vaccinated.
Interestingly,

22
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:29,780
I grew up with two parents that
were into alternative medicine,

23
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:34,700
so I was not vaccinated as a child,
but as I got older I vaccinated myself.

24
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:37,430
Well,
I was vaccinated as a child,

25
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:42,450
but in my last vaccine was about 15 years
ago when I returned to college and I

26
00:01:43,851 --> 00:01:48,710
had a severe reaction in that
I became arthritic in my hands.

27
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:49,461
Went to many,

28
00:01:49,461 --> 00:01:52,660
many doctors that nobody knew what was
going on and why it was happening and

29
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:56,180
just shrugged like it doesn't make sense.
You're too young to have arthritis.

30
00:01:56,210 --> 00:02:01,040
And it wasn't until having kids and
sort of digging into my own research for

31
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:04,610
them that a lot of
answers started coming up.

32
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,400
And I think it's unfortunate
that a lot of it is overlooked

33
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:12,540
for me, it, I'll continue
to get vaccinated. We know
regardless of of the risks,

34
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:15,120
because I've seen too many
things on the other side.

35
00:02:15,121 --> 00:02:19,290
I've seen kids come into the ICU and
die from being on getting the flu.

36
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,890
I've always felt like though,

37
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:25,410
the risks are far outweighed by
the benefits of, of getting the

38
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:26,323
protection,

39
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,720
not getting vaccinated and
dangerous other people.

40
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:37,483
Okay.

41
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,350
I will acknowledge of course as a
pediatrician, I know vaccines work.

42
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:46,120
I know they give you protection and they
vary greatly in what that protection is.

43
00:02:46,121 --> 00:02:49,750
It's not like a hundred percent
magical shield over you completely,

44
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:53,650
but I do acknowledge there are some
vaccines like the measles vaccine and the

45
00:02:53,651 --> 00:02:57,670
chicken pox vaccine, but honestly if
you don't get those vaccines, yeah,

46
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:01,030
you do risk the disease
and passing it to others.

47
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,980
It's such a complicated topic.

48
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:06,930
Vaccines and you're starting to get micro
with each individual vaccine and that

49
00:03:06,931 --> 00:03:10,660
definitely the question was talking
about the big picture and I think yeah,

50
00:03:10,661 --> 00:03:13,420
if you get micro,
probably some of these vaccines.

51
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:16,780
I think when you're giving kids
medication you have to get micro about it.

52
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,840
I don't think it's doing your kids any
service to just say vaccines are all made

53
00:03:22,361 --> 00:03:26,290
the same and they're all safe and
healthy and good for you that everybody's

54
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:28,660
benefiting from it because that's false.

55
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,210
We studied them before we
released them to the public.

56
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:35,610
We study them so we do know they're safe.
That's the thing is we know ish.

57
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:36,920
What else?
He say,

58
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,530
being an intensivist,
I see the worst of the worst,

59
00:03:40,531 --> 00:03:44,520
and so seeing the other side of
kids who don't get vaccinated,

60
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:49,170
I saw a kid walking with meningococcemia,
which I haven't seen in decades.

61
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,090
He had all four limbs cut off.

62
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,970
They had to be amputated
because it was all dead tissue.

63
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:57,570
You forget how bad things
were before we had vaccines.

64
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:05,670
I didn't step forward for that because
I don't like the assumption that if a

65
00:04:05,671 --> 00:04:07,050
child is unvaccinated,

66
00:04:07,051 --> 00:04:12,051
somehow they are of risk to everyone
and also knowing that vaccinated

67
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:14,820
individuals can also be
carrying and spreading diseases.

68
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:17,910
I think it's very polarizing to separate
the two as if if you're vaccinated,

69
00:04:17,911 --> 00:04:19,890
you're totally fine.
You're not risking anybody anything.

70
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:23,460
Unvaccinated children don't just have
diseases and hanging out in their bodies

71
00:04:23,461 --> 00:04:28,050
waiting to unload at any moment.
Anybody could be spreading diseases,

72
00:04:28,051 --> 00:04:32,400
especially things like polio and pertussis
that are not completely covered by

73
00:04:32,401 --> 00:04:33,234
the vaccine.

74
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:34,600
Okay.

75
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,420
I do anything to keep my child safe.

76
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:47,210
I agree. I don't have kids, but
when I think about it, you know,

77
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,310
the idea was vaccines is
you're protecting all of us.

78
00:04:50,311 --> 00:04:51,650
You're protecting the group.
Okay.

79
00:04:51,651 --> 00:04:55,740
Now there's this idea of herd immunity
and so I think that's why it's really

80
00:04:55,741 --> 00:05:00,090
important to talk about because this is
an issue that doesn't just affect you.

81
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:03,360
It affects everyone around you because
there's people that aren't vaccinated

82
00:05:03,361 --> 00:05:08,361
that are sick or have immune issues or
they're too young to get a vaccine and

83
00:05:08,461 --> 00:05:10,190
they count on her to immunity.
I think

84
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:11,091
most people too,

85
00:05:11,091 --> 00:05:13,970
like I started out vaccinating my
daughter because I believed all the same

86
00:05:13,971 --> 00:05:14,804
things that you said.

87
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:19,010
It wasn't until she had a reaction and
several reactions that I actually had to

88
00:05:19,011 --> 00:05:20,270
look at it differently where I,

89
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:23,510
I realized that by continuing
vaccinating for her,

90
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:27,470
that actually would hurt her and yet
everyone wants me to do it for the

91
00:05:27,471 --> 00:05:31,070
population as if I'm supposed to continue
to sacrifice my child for everyone

92
00:05:31,071 --> 00:05:31,460
else.

93
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:34,760
Well, I mean there, there are
medical exemptions for vaccines.

94
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,540
If your child has a reaction and
then there's, there's concern,

95
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,320
I think that's valid,
but I think a,

96
00:05:40,321 --> 00:05:45,321
a larger population is using other
justifications to not get the vaccine.

97
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:48,660
You know, a number of families
who look into vaccines,

98
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,720
they will decide to opt out of vaccines
because they feel they are just not

99
00:05:53,941 --> 00:05:57,980
willing to risk the side effects.
But side effects or the

100
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,100
side effects are like one in a million,
one in 2 million.

101
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,230
Whereas the side effects
from the diseases,

102
00:06:03,231 --> 00:06:05,540
when I see all these outbreaks
and things like that,

103
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:06,880
I'm going to choose vaccines everyday.

104
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:07,631
And that's,

105
00:06:07,631 --> 00:06:11,440
I think right there is the disservice to
this conversation because it is a risk

106
00:06:11,441 --> 00:06:15,760
benefit analysis. And what's unfortunate
is how downplay those risks are.

107
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:19,520
I only started investigating vaccines
because I ended up with a kid with an auto

108
00:06:19,521 --> 00:06:23,410
immune disorder. So what does that
mean? And instead of finding answers,

109
00:06:23,411 --> 00:06:27,240
I have more questions. The
one in a million is not a
real number. It's really not.

110
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:32,160
And so the more that that is put out
and so people think that no, it's not.

111
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:34,210
Not when you're talking about
the different kinds of reactions,

112
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:39,130
well I think the number you're referring
to is Anna Filactic shock that Anna

113
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:41,170
Filactic shock is of course,
extremely rare.

114
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:45,930
Whereas when you look at seizures from
the MMR vaccine in our one in 3000 right.

115
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,900
But again is creating fear,

116
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,700
worry that you get the those on
your side kind of down play those.

117
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,280
So my daughter has seizures,

118
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,940
seizures for most people are considered
kind of a big deal. You know,

119
00:06:57,941 --> 00:07:01,480
when it happens to you that
that downplayed element of,

120
00:07:01,481 --> 00:07:05,290
while that's not Anna Filactic shock,
it's just a seizure. It is just a seizure.

121
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:06,990
But seizures can be dangerous.

122
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,550
I don't think it's an idea of downplay.

123
00:07:08,551 --> 00:07:11,820
I think it comes back to what we were
saying with the risk benefit analysis.

124
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:16,910
And I think the data's very clear that
the benefits of giving vaccines by far

125
00:07:17,401 --> 00:07:21,210
outweigh the risks. So I don't think
it's a question of downplaying the risks.

126
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,080
They're there,

127
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:27,480
but we also know that children were
dying and now they're not. And yes,

128
00:07:27,481 --> 00:07:28,680
there's side effects,

129
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:32,980
but they're not as bad as
what we had before. Vaccines,

130
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:38,130
I don't always trust my doctor's opinion.

131
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:49,940
Anytime anyone, whether it's a teacher, a
friend, something I read online, my mom,

132
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:53,690
you know, my, the doctor, anytime
anyone tells me, oh you should do this.

133
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:57,730
Especially if it has to do
with their health, I'm going
to do research. And it's,

134
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:02,360
I would be careful about saying it's that
I don't trust my doctor, but that has,

135
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:04,490
that trust has been developed over time.

136
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:07,490
And so I would say in the early years
when my children were very young,

137
00:08:07,491 --> 00:08:10,580
when they would say, this
is what we recommend, yes,

138
00:08:10,581 --> 00:08:14,090
of course there were times where I got
a second opinion or did the research on

139
00:08:14,091 --> 00:08:18,440
my own and ask the questions. And I
think that as parents we have to do that.

140
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:23,060
Well, it's hard to trust someone who sees
your child for 10 minutes, twice a year.

141
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:26,360
Uh, in the end, parents
know their children best.

142
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,290
And that little office visit where
your pediatrician looks at your child,

143
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:33,050
he does not know your child
the way you know your child.

144
00:08:33,051 --> 00:08:36,230
So it's really hard for
whatever recommendation he's
making to be really based

145
00:08:36,231 --> 00:08:38,060
in India,
individualized for your kid.

146
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:41,180
So if you were to come to
your doctor and say, Hey,

147
00:08:41,181 --> 00:08:44,480
my child is acting differently after this,
this well visit appointment,

148
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,470
something's wrong.

149
00:08:45,471 --> 00:08:49,370
You want them to trust that you have an
established relationship and listened to

150
00:08:49,371 --> 00:08:53,270
you and hear you and understand that as
a mother just because you don't have the

151
00:08:53,271 --> 00:08:57,630
Dr in front of your name, it doesn't
your opinion somehow less valuable.

152
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,880
Yeah,
I mean I think like anyone,

153
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,900
doctors are fallible and they don't
know everything and I think it's very

154
00:09:03,901 --> 00:09:04,261
important,

155
00:09:04,261 --> 00:09:09,030
like you were mentioning to have a really
strong doctor patient relationship.

156
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:13,230
I think that's really hard. And today's
10 minute appointment age, you know,

157
00:09:13,231 --> 00:09:15,600
it makes it really difficult.
But like as a young doctor,

158
00:09:15,601 --> 00:09:19,650
I think there's a lot of distrust when
it comes to physician recommendations.

159
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,920
It sucks because you know,

160
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:26,950
you spend decades training and learning
and your heart is in this place where

161
00:09:27,061 --> 00:09:31,890
you want to like be of service to
people and then you're not trusted.

162
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,080
But you know,
to answer the question,

163
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,960
you shouldn't just blindly trust
anyone's opinion, your doctor or anyone.

164
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,920
Ironically, the doctors
are the ones that, well,

165
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,180
I trust my physicians.
Um,

166
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:50,400
my daughter has epilepsy and in March
she was also diagnosed with juvenile

167
00:09:53,561 --> 00:09:54,850
idiopathic arthritis.

168
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,180
I went to the rheumatologist and the
rheumatologist is that we're going to put

169
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:01,540
her on methotrexate. And I looked
at her, I'm like, methotrexate,

170
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:06,100
that's a chemotherapy
chemotherapeutic agent that,
you know, kids with cancer get.

171
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,480
And she's like,
yes,

172
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:11,380
but we use it in a low dose and it
doesn't cause harmful side effects.

173
00:10:11,381 --> 00:10:14,140
You have to trust me. I said, okay.

174
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,900
And I trusted her and I
am so glad that I did.

175
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:21,040
Before all this happened,

176
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:24,910
she was a competitive gymnast and she
used to walk up and down the stairs.

177
00:10:24,911 --> 00:10:27,550
Like she was 90 years old.
She couldn't hold a pencil in her hand.

178
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:32,860
Now she's back on the bars back on the,
on the beam doing things,

179
00:10:32,861 --> 00:10:37,390
which my wife and I
never thought that she would do again.

180
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:43,000
So yes. Do I trust my physicians? Yes.
Do I question them? Yes. I will say,

181
00:10:43,001 --> 00:10:47,370
look, can we do this for her? Can we
do this instead? And yes. You know, I,

182
00:10:47,371 --> 00:10:52,120
I can appreciate what you guys have
said as far as people hearing you.

183
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:56,650
And I think that's the biggest problem
in medicine is that time is short.

184
00:10:56,710 --> 00:11:01,540
Clinicians aren't listening. And I think
that as, as a pediatrician, you know,

185
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:05,380
one of the most important jobs that
we have is to listen to parents.

186
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,870
And I think that if any
pediatrician isn't doing that,

187
00:11:07,871 --> 00:11:08,950
they're not doing their job.

188
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:14,620
There is too much hostility
between the two sides.

189
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,620
I don't like it. I don't, I
want us to be able to talk.

190
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:28,030
I want us to be able to have
relevant and educated conversations.

191
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:33,690
And I think at the core of
this conversation is what
is at the core of humanity

192
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:35,680
and being a parent,

193
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:39,520
which is that we all want to do right by
our children and we want to lead happy,

194
00:11:39,521 --> 00:11:41,670
healthy and productive lives.
Yeah.

195
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:46,770
I have no doubts in my mind of how
I've come to my decision making on the

196
00:11:48,431 --> 00:11:52,540
subject, which has been tedious
and thorough to say the least.

197
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:55,210
I did not to go down this path in my life,

198
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:57,970
but I have people who
won't be friends with me,

199
00:11:57,971 --> 00:12:00,730
who I've had death
threats on social media.

200
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:04,630
I might not even be able to send my kids
to school depending on how legislation

201
00:12:04,631 --> 00:12:08,080
changes because of the
way I think it just,

202
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:12,370
it's insane to me how hostile this has
become and it's not doing a service to

203
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:16,480
research and science move forward and
just the overall dialogues we have in our

204
00:12:16,481 --> 00:12:18,160
culture,
whatever the subject,

205
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:23,460
what I think is lacking in this debate
or conversation is really compassion from

206
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,430
the provax side or pro mandate side.

207
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:32,110
I'll say the people who refuse to
acknowledge the vaccine reactions are

208
00:12:32,111 --> 00:12:34,120
happening or that the things
that happened to my daughter,

209
00:12:34,121 --> 00:12:37,150
we're connected because maybe it was
just a coincidence and I just needed

210
00:12:37,151 --> 00:12:39,790
something to pin it on.
You are socially isolated.

211
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:43,540
You can be isolated by your family,
isolated by the medical community,

212
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:46,570
community isolated by society as
a whole because they assume you're

213
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,960
unintelligent, uneducated, any rational.

214
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,380
I wish there was just
more compassion that, no,

215
00:12:53,381 --> 00:12:56,710
we don't want to make something difficult.
We just want to be acknowledged.

216
00:12:56,711 --> 00:13:00,160
My daughter was a victim
and she's being punished.

217
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,430
When I signed up for this,

218
00:13:01,431 --> 00:13:06,320
it was a little bit of trepidation coming
into this because you do hear things

219
00:13:06,321 --> 00:13:07,100
in the media.

220
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:11,240
You know about the people who are anti
vaccine and the way they respond to

221
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:15,800
physicians and an end. It is a little
bit scary. You know, as as physicians,

222
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:19,760
we care about people.
There's compassion on,

223
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:24,020
on the medical community side. We
wouldn't do this if we, if we didn't care.

224
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,100
But again,
you know,

225
00:13:25,101 --> 00:13:28,910
I do have compassion for the families
that have gone through issues with,

226
00:13:28,911 --> 00:13:30,800
you know,
with vaccines and I've,

227
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:34,730
I have great deal of compassion for
the families that had children die from

228
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,430
preventable diseases.
There shouldn't be any hostility.

229
00:13:37,431 --> 00:13:40,380
There should be discussion. I mean,
we can always question things that,

230
00:13:40,381 --> 00:13:44,360
that's how we evolve. That's how we get
better. If we didn't question anything,

231
00:13:44,361 --> 00:13:45,830
we'd be still in the dark.
Yeah.

232
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:47,763
Thank you

233
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:56,160
for sharing your story, doctor. It
was a pleasure. It's a pleasure. Dot.

234
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:57,840
You've got to kind of say around,
yeah.

235
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:01,790
Hey guys. I'm Kendra. I'm Aaron
