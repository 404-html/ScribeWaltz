1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,010
Depression's up.
Anxiety's up.

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:06,230
We didn't know that comes from
a lack of innocence right now.

3
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:21,430
Hi, I'm a tail. I am 16
and I build a robots.

4
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,230
I'm Taylor,

5
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:27,400
I'm 18 and I'm really passionate
about singing in about music.

6
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:32,440
Hi, I'm Isabella. I'm
16 and I fly a plane,

7
00:00:32,441 --> 00:00:34,900
which is a Cessna one seven two hi,

8
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:38,590
I'm fanny and I not going to see my age

9
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:42,520
and I'm a filmmaker.
I'm an Islam.

10
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:46,960
I'm 39 plus one and I am a film director.

11
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:51,970
I'm Jeremiah. I'm 41 I'm a regional
sales manager for a telecomm company.

12
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,600
Oh,
Laurie?

13
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,333
Yeah.

14
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:02,263
Okay.

15
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:07,410
Okay. Well I'll start. So
right now I'm learning every,

16
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:11,230
I like a new thing every day,
but like if I had a lot more years,

17
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,870
then by the time I'm like
90 I'll know everything.

18
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:15,630
Yeah, that great. Yeah,

19
00:01:15,631 --> 00:01:19,580
just simple things like with learning how
people around you act that you learned

20
00:01:19,581 --> 00:01:23,220
so much that you're, you're not
going to learn as a 10 year old.

21
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,100
I think it's Paris. I'd like to
say I feel I know nothing. I mean,

22
00:01:29,101 --> 00:01:33,750
literally every day I say to you, I'm
just guessing. And the older I've got,

23
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:37,080
the more I've realized that everybody
else around me is winging it and they

24
00:01:37,081 --> 00:01:40,110
don't know everything either.
And we're all just trying our best.

25
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:43,570
Like when you're young,
you're like, I know everything
about everything. You know,

26
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:46,510
from what I know to what, I
don't know. That's, you know,

27
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:50,220
those two things are just completely on
opposite ends of the spectrum. Right.

28
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:53,990
For me,
jeans today,

29
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:59,590
Lisa,

30
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:05,790
Teens Rock, but uh, you know,

31
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:10,270
it's forced on you and a lot
earlier age online for teen boys.

32
00:02:10,271 --> 00:02:13,080
I mean they can find
horrible images everywhere.

33
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:16,030
Um, I definitely do agree that
there's a lot more exposure.

34
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:19,720
It's not like an intentional thing.
I don't think kids are just like worse.

35
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:23,230
It's just easier to get
caught up in bad situations.

36
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:27,750
Okay. Well, I personally think that
we're more innocent now because parents,

37
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,850
you guys could get away with
a lot more back in the day.

38
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:33,230
Yeah, it was, we were
naughty. We would do,

39
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:37,940
we did a lot of things my parents never
knew. But now I can, I can, you know,

40
00:02:37,941 --> 00:02:40,090
check on his phone where he's at and,

41
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:43,070
but sometimes you go down
the rabbit hole where you,

42
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,850
do you think your kids are super
innocent and then you realize,

43
00:02:45,851 --> 00:02:49,810
oh they have to snap. What's
this other snack? What's,
what's this other Instagram?

44
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:53,990
Oh I have a day when you don't know
about everybody has, you know, they,

45
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,660
I think you have to be more devious.

46
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:59,710
Well I mean this one time that you got
Instagram and all friends out of me,

47
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:00,040
they added

48
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,590
me to the first Instagram account
though chief parents don't see.

49
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,830
And that was slightly
disappointed in them as people,

50
00:03:05,831 --> 00:03:10,730
but I didn't know you had Instagram.
See I got rid of it now.

51
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:13,810
But I think you have to give
credit to some of the kids. I do.

52
00:03:13,811 --> 00:03:17,110
I think that there are some kids
who haven't got two Instagrams.

53
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:20,920
And actually trust is the biggest
element for me as a parent. I trust her.

54
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,100
Yeah. I mean if the question was
do you think your teen is innocent?

55
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:25,400
But when I say it,

56
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:29,640
teens, but I still think it's
50 50 you're saying your friends

57
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:33,650
suicide rates are up,
depression's up. Anxiety's up.

58
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:39,340
We didn't know that. Just from a lack of
innocence. Right. I think they were the,

59
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:42,100
I know three or four people in
my class that had those problems,

60
00:03:42,101 --> 00:03:46,290
but they weren't spoken of.
I definitely agree that it's more I do

61
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:51,820
there,
no

62
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,500
you can't.

63
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,990
I think for me it's,

64
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:05,770
I don't know if you know how much,

65
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:11,280
I almost judge myself by seeing
all the people on social media.

66
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:15,690
Yeah, I do. Because that'd be
telling you I worry every day.

67
00:04:15,691 --> 00:04:19,140
You don't know this when I'm on your
social media looking at all these other

68
00:04:19,141 --> 00:04:20,340
things that people would be doing,

69
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:23,760
just hoping you haven't seen it
or that you're not affected by it.

70
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,160
So I worry about that all the time.

71
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:31,490
But I don't say anything about it because
this probably won't be surprised cause

72
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:35,700
he saw my grades from that year.
But in the off more year,

73
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:40,620
I skipped math class like all the
time. It was awful. So yeah. Does that,

74
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:42,380
you know,

75
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,910
one of the things that I don't think you
know about me is like I feel like I'm

76
00:04:44,911 --> 00:04:48,690
always holding my breath. Do you know
I'm a lot softer person. I'm, you know,

77
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,420
when I get bored on my work conference
call, they tell you I doodle.

78
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,970
But I actually,
I write poetry and in a lot,

79
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,120
but I don't exactly like to talk
about it or put it out there.

80
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:02,570
I wish I knew more.
How was your day? Good.

81
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:06,770
Please tell me what's going on please.
I just want to know,

82
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:10,610
like I could tell you a lot more about
what I do, but it's pretty boring.

83
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,100
I like today on the way here,

84
00:05:13,101 --> 00:05:17,450
you told me you're working
on a documentary when you
know I'm a documentarian,

85
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:21,170
like shouldn't I know these things like
this way I do for a living, you know,

86
00:05:21,171 --> 00:05:24,200
I only have a couple of years
left before you go to college.

87
00:05:24,201 --> 00:05:26,860
I really want to be a part of it.

88
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,533
Cool.

89
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:45,360
Yeah, I mean I made the decision to have
kids and I gave up that control of what

90
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:49,980
really for me, what I had to raise a
family and, and it's like my own fault,

91
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,780
but I got kids out of it. That's great.
I'll take the win on that. But you know,

92
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:57,500
I want more control in terms of what I
want to do and that's gonna make happy

93
00:05:57,501 --> 00:05:58,550
and more fulfilled.

94
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:02,160
Why I feel like I Walmart control,
it's not, I wouldn't even,

95
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:06,170
I wouldn't say it's your
mom, it's, I just would like,

96
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:08,940
like to be doing more things by now.

97
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,120
There's so many things that I wish I
knew like for music and like making an

98
00:06:14,311 --> 00:06:16,080
actual song and things like that.

99
00:06:16,081 --> 00:06:20,430
So I feel like it's more of
that environmental holding
me back then like home

100
00:06:20,431 --> 00:06:24,540
life
for me,

101
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:27,480
I really didn't feel like I
was a good trauma own life.

102
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:32,630
Now that I'm 40 I feel like I'm finally
grown into who I am truly as an adult

103
00:06:35,071 --> 00:06:38,640
and owning it. I'm in charge of
my own life. It's nobody else.

104
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:42,690
I'm personally good with the amount of
controller have though I would like it if

105
00:06:42,691 --> 00:06:44,400
you can show me how to control it myself.

106
00:06:44,401 --> 00:06:49,050
So when I finally got to college and I'm
an ink pen and I can actually have to

107
00:06:49,051 --> 00:06:50,140
do these things.
Yeah,

108
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:55,060
I think I'm currently very happy
where I am with what I control cause I

109
00:06:55,061 --> 00:06:58,210
understand that there are some things
that I don't have control over.

110
00:06:58,211 --> 00:07:00,550
And I think when the divorce happened,

111
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
having your parents break up as to
to see something as big as that,

112
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,260
that is something I have no control over,

113
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:16,450
but I knew that I could control how my
room looked, what I ate, what I wore.

114
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:20,680
I kind of embraced and took hold off
because I knew that that sort of,

115
00:07:20,681 --> 00:07:21,580
I had control over.

116
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:26,610
I wish in my relationship
with the other side.

117
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:36,600
I don't know about this.
I think I'll go,

118
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:40,970
why are you shaking your head?

119
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,680
I think there's always
room for improvement.

120
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,200
Even if you're at like the best seats,

121
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:48,950
you always want to get a better
relationship with your parents. Got It.

122
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:51,760
I just,
I feel like it.

123
00:07:51,761 --> 00:07:55,940
So I had kids when I was 20 by the time
I was 22 I had both my kids because I

124
00:07:55,941 --> 00:07:58,880
was a young parent. I look at my
kids and I go, oh that really,

125
00:07:58,881 --> 00:08:02,900
that mess that messed him up. Dang it.
They're going to remember that one.

126
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:07,580
You know, I just, it's like, it's hard
because I know I haven't been, you know,

127
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:11,000
completely perfect one. I wish I could
have a bunch of reduced but I can't.

128
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:15,860
So moving forward I want
to try to continue to work
on and get closer for sure.

129
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:21,540
Like at this point what like both like
me and you are looking for is just how

130
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:22,374
to,

131
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:27,410
how to have like the father daughter
connection still after high school I and I

132
00:08:28,051 --> 00:08:30,470
think we both feel that
really hard right now. Yeah.

133
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:34,170
I also had them young and you know,
I'm divorced,

134
00:08:34,171 --> 00:08:39,171
so single mom with two kids and says
pursuing the career while dating and I was

135
00:08:42,811 --> 00:08:46,380
feel like, oh my gosh, I
did the whole thing wrong

136
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:53,540
because there I am going to Bates and I
do feel like it had an impact in them.

137
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,560
Especially my dad was my youngest.
Okay.

138
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:59,700
You were a lot like
you're always gone a lot,

139
00:08:59,701 --> 00:09:02,250
but that didn't really change
the relationship that much.

140
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:07,700
I don't think you having today was a bad
thing or having me to really even know

141
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:12,450
you probably could have waited a little
bit more and there's, for example,

142
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:14,160
there's always still room for improvement.

143
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:25,770
It's not me saying that I wished the
relationship would stay where it was good.

144
00:09:25,771 --> 00:09:26,900
I think we're in a good place.

145
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:30,620
I just don't feel right now that
it needs to be better. Well in the,

146
00:09:30,621 --> 00:09:34,670
I don't think it's definitely not perfect,
but we're learning at the same time.

147
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:39,980
Improve it constantly. Yeah, constantly
checking in every day with each other.

148
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:44,420
We're always changing and I think
you have to s to work with that.

00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:45,813
Yeah.
