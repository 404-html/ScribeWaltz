1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,070
This is a physical manifestation of love.

2
00:00:02,071 --> 00:00:07,020
This is glorious and beautiful and any
God, which denies me for this going out,

3
00:00:07,021 --> 00:00:07,854
but part of it,

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:09,583
okay,

5
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:17,610
on the left hand side,

6
00:00:17,611 --> 00:00:21,690
can I have my LGBT folks on the right
hand side and I have my concerns.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,350
There are times when I feel uncomfortable
expressing my views around sexuality.

8
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:39,953
Yeah.

9
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:44,580
I am uncomfortable primarily
because the bromance of like,

10
00:00:44,581 --> 00:00:49,581
well there's two girls who's the boy and
then it really just breaks the ice as

11
00:00:49,641 --> 00:00:53,790
it's like there isn't supposed to
be a boy. That's why we're there.

12
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:58,050
I do my best to break the ice with the
comedic deflection, which I've learned is,

13
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,110
is a self defense mechanism.
Right.

14
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,430
So I come from a very

15
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,010
serving of community and so, you
know, it just wasn't talked about.

16
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,280
The people I've had the most conversation
with about actually my family,

17
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,490
which is really weird cause I came out
to my parents because my dad was going to

18
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:17,910
be leading the protests at
the pride festival that my
boyfriend want me to go to.

19
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,300
So I'm a, I'm a pastor as well. Um,

20
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,820
I'm also a community leader and Boyle
heights and in that community there is a

21
00:01:26,821 --> 00:01:29,220
large, um, LGBTQ presence.

22
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:34,170
So there's that fear of really coming
out and say what I believe because I do

23
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:38,880
love everybody and I don't want to be
pushed to the side just because I have a

24
00:01:38,881 --> 00:01:42,690
certain feeling about any topic really.

25
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:49,030
I just wanted to say too,
and you know,

26
00:01:49,031 --> 00:01:52,720
it's not the beliefs that sometimes
I have a problem with her.

27
00:01:52,721 --> 00:01:56,170
I think people have a problem with in
China it's just like the actions from the

28
00:01:56,171 --> 00:01:58,510
belief,
so like it's okay to have beliefs,

29
00:01:58,511 --> 00:02:03,160
but if we like can be loving and our
beliefs and you know how our actions come

30
00:02:03,161 --> 00:02:06,820
from those beliefs and like I love that
we're having this conversation, you know,

31
00:02:06,821 --> 00:02:09,400
like trying to breach those,
like build a bridge.

32
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:14,000
Some sins are worse than others.

33
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,093
Okay.

34
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:23,800
In the eyes of, you know,
of the God I worship,

35
00:02:23,801 --> 00:02:28,801
I believe that any sin separates us
from him because he's holy and pure.

36
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:33,730
But at the same time I think there are
certain sins that will have greater

37
00:02:33,731 --> 00:02:37,810
consequences. I resonate with that.
For me, it would be, you know,

38
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:40,990
killing another human is the worst.
That's it.

39
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:44,800
Also it Venn diagrams into abortion.

40
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:49,180
Taking the life of another is huge,
is huge.

41
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:54,040
Can I ask you to this, uh, do you
all see homosexuality as a sin?

42
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:59,420
Yes. And if so, where on that
scale, I don't think I'm, uh,

43
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,440
homosexual tendency or an attraction to
somebody of the same gender is a sin.

44
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:10,000
Um, I think that's a natural feeling.
I think when you start engaging, um,

45
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:15,350
in a lifestyle and you act upon that
tendency then because it goes against what

46
00:03:16,691 --> 00:03:20,020
I believe God designed, then I,
I think that's clearly a sin.

47
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:26,840
I just don't believe in sin because I
feel that sometimes being punitive about

48
00:03:26,841 --> 00:03:31,841
things can like make you repress things
and like instinctually I was like,

49
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:37,820
but not acting on them would be a thin,
like that's how it feels for me.

50
00:03:37,821 --> 00:03:41,000
Like being dishonest to
myself at that feels wrong.

51
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:47,210
At some point in my life I
was taught that sex is wrong.

52
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,130
Okay.

53
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:54,500
I guess like within the
context, uh, you know,

54
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:57,660
sex is bad outside the
context of marriage. Um,

55
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:00,950
and so I guess that's how
identified with the question.

56
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:01,900
Oh,

57
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:06,900
I had a very strong religious upbringing
and I ended up doing a lot of self harm

58
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:12,510
and I ended up doing a lot of things just
to try and cope with these urges that

59
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:16,540
when I finally gave
into them, oh, this is,

60
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:19,000
this is a physical manifestation of love.

61
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:23,050
This is glorious and
beautiful and any God,

62
00:04:23,051 --> 00:04:24,670
which denies me for this I
don't want have a part of,

63
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:30,810
because whatever this is is I know for
a fact to be a truth because it is the

64
00:04:31,331 --> 00:04:32,164
nature of love.

65
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:36,200
Yeah. I'm just responding
to your story. Uh,

66
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:41,510
it makes me sad to hear that, um,
that you decided to hurt yourself.

67
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,800
Um,
yeah,

68
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:50,510
I still hold on to what
I believe are my beliefs,

69
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,250
but at the same time,

70
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:57,520
I wish there was a better way for you
to talk to someone and to process and to

71
00:04:58,491 --> 00:05:02,180
think through, um, reconciling
how you feel with like,

72
00:05:02,181 --> 00:05:05,360
what you may have been taught
or have read through scripture.

73
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:08,330
Yeah, I mean, and that's the
thing is I think there's a lot of,

74
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:13,160
there's a lot of cultural baggage I
think around Christianity that isn't

75
00:05:13,161 --> 00:05:17,690
necessarily inherently part
of any biblical Christianity.

76
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:23,060
Even though I grew up in
a Christian family, I was,

77
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:27,500
I don't recall ever being told that
sex was wrong or it was a bad thing.

78
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:32,360
Um, I think I, I grew up
with the understanding that
sex is a beautiful thing.

79
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:36,800
It was given to us as a gift to enjoy.
There's a place where it's,

80
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,850
it's been designed for a place where we
can enjoy it and there's a place where

81
00:05:40,851 --> 00:05:44,570
it's, it's the testable in
the side of the creator,

82
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,230
the one who gave it to us.
I just don't like the idea.

83
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:51,270
Yeah. That anything's really
detestable, you know what I mean? So I,

84
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:55,260
I just don't like it. You see that even
in sex for you within certain context is,

85
00:05:55,261 --> 00:05:57,190
is testable.
Like,

86
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:02,060
like if it's nonconsensual like that's
pretty detestable. Yeah, I agree.

87
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,770
Even in that,
the things that I can

88
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,750
send to are,
I think,

89
00:06:05,751 --> 00:06:10,270
not that like at that I have sometimes no
control over it. If it's not consented,

90
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:16,320
people should honor the pronouns
others wish to be called.

91
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:17,740
Oh,

92
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,450
hesitations enough.

93
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:27,900
I'm all for this. Like I identify
as gay people don't consider it.

94
00:06:27,901 --> 00:06:31,920
And I think that like having these
conversations about how people want to

95
00:06:31,921 --> 00:06:36,090
identify is like really important in a
way that we can move things forward and

96
00:06:36,091 --> 00:06:36,924
stuff.

97
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,310
Yeah. I forgot to like, hey, if
you don't use right, whatever,

98
00:06:39,311 --> 00:06:41,910
you're gonna get fined or
whatever. Like that's, I, I'm,

99
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:46,450
I'm not a big fan of that or
conversations between us, but yeah.

100
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,500
But otherwise it's just being
respectful. Oh, the Pronoun Police.

101
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,220
So for me,
um,

102
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:57,490
I never correct people because many
times people do confuse me as sir.

103
00:06:57,491 --> 00:07:02,470
I don't know. It doesn't faze me. However,
I'm born in a female body. I'm a sheet.

104
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,500
There are times where my
girlfriends, oh, my boyfriend,

105
00:07:05,501 --> 00:07:07,750
isn't that just because
of their comfort zone.

106
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,380
They don't want to have to deal
with the whole like social stigma.

107
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:14,920
So you're comfortable with them
presenting you as a, as a male.

108
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:16,180
It doesn't faze me.

109
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:20,410
It doesn't phase me at all because my
identity and my expressions are masculine.

110
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,530
And I've come to the terms
in the realization that I
don't need to chop up my

111
00:07:23,531 --> 00:07:27,040
body and the different pieces to fit
in a social little box. That is, man,

112
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:31,930
if you want to address me you can address
me as he or she or them are girl Becky

113
00:07:31,931 --> 00:07:36,880
with the good hair. It doesn't as
long as the term is respectful.

114
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,930
Yeah, I will take it. Uh,

115
00:07:38,931 --> 00:07:42,870
I'm an ice tea bag just because it's a
complicated topic because with language,

116
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:43,950
language is powerful.

117
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:48,720
And so when somebody who I would consider
a female wants to be called a a male,

118
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:53,460
I would want to probably respect that.
But um, I still firmly believe that,

119
00:07:53,461 --> 00:07:57,000
you know, they're like God created
there to be men and a woman and um,

120
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:01,800
I would like to sit down and talk to that
person in depth before leaning one way

121
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:03,890
or the other.
Yeah.

122
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:07,350
And I think like focusing more on like
building a relationship instead of just

123
00:08:07,351 --> 00:08:10,970
like grilling some, why do you feel,
you know what I mean? Like just try it.

124
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,720
What's wrong with you? Like, why

125
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:24,810
America is heading in the right
direction when it comes to inclusion and

126
00:08:24,811 --> 00:08:25,644
diversity.

127
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:30,843
Okay.

128
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:34,360
Uh,

129
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:39,360
for me it's more like the youth are
headed in like inclusion and diversity.

130
00:08:40,651 --> 00:08:45,090
And I wouldn't necessarily say
it's the institutions of power.

131
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,900
I think the youth are really moving
our culture forward and like it's

132
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:49,950
encouraging to see,

133
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:58,790
I can't imagine what it's like to not be
able to be who I am and having to hide.

134
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:03,170
So I think it's good in that sense
that people finally are living in a,

135
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:07,470
in a world where I can be who I am and
I don't have to be ostracized and I can

136
00:09:07,471 --> 00:09:11,700
be included. And the reason why I
didn't step in is because, um, you know,

137
00:09:11,701 --> 00:09:15,930
I have certain values of
that I think are from God.

138
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:20,820
And so that's why I hesitated a little
bit on do I come forward or not? But,

139
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,330
well I have a question cause I,
you know,

140
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:27,200
I'm curious where the sanctity
of your marriage comes in.

141
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:31,610
Like if you can only get married to wound
because you and God and. Dot. Woman,

142
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:36,260
how about relationship that is perfect
for you. I'm curious how that affects,

143
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:38,450
uh,
who we can marry.

144
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:43,250
Yeah.
I don't think the job of a Christian,

145
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,690
for example,
um,

146
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,720
is to get people to behave in a certain
moral way that's in line with what the

147
00:09:50,601 --> 00:09:54,800
Bible says. I wouldn't be
wanting to say you can't marry,

148
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:58,760
you can't marry another guy or you
can't marry another girl. I would say,

149
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:03,750
first of all, God loves you. You
know, God loves you. Yeah. So, uh,

150
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:07,460
specifically talking about like
propping, um, when properly came out,

151
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,560
I was completely against it.

152
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:14,590
I thought it was foolish and ignorant
and in by many churches supporting prop

153
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,180
eight,
we basically tell you,

154
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:20,480
told the gay community that
we don't care about you.

155
00:10:20,481 --> 00:10:24,440
We don't care about how you feel,
what you think love is.

156
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:28,220
We're just going to mandate that you
can't marry who you say you want to marry.

157
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:31,250
We're adversaries. Yeah.
We became adversaries.

158
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:36,460
And the church I think lost a great
position and saying and coming to people

159
00:10:36,741 --> 00:10:38,030
saying like,
we love you.

160
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:44,090
People should have the right to
have sex with anyone. They want

161
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:50,470
anyone. Okay. Yeah. Alright.

162
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:55,010
Consensually right. Alright.
Essentially with anyone. I,

163
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:59,870
okay. Yes. In the term
anyone except children.

164
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,970
Yeah. As humans, we and his
creatures of a divine spirit,

165
00:11:04,971 --> 00:11:09,971
we have the right to follow our instincts
and our sexual urges without punishing

166
00:11:10,161 --> 00:11:15,090
ourselves for, you know,
wanting a woman. You're wanting
a man and so, yeah. And you,

167
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:19,160
anyone has the right to
consensual love making.

168
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,833
Yeah.

169
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:26,230
So, um, the, the reason
why I stepped back and,

170
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,450
and you guys would agree with me, but, um,

171
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:33,940
when I was nine years old, I was
touched by a family member. Bye.

172
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:38,933
Okay.

173
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,750
And so, you know, if that's,
I can't set forward when,

174
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,690
when that question is asked and,

175
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,100
and I know you guys want to
agree with that and that's you,

176
00:11:47,101 --> 00:11:49,680
you preference of the very beginning that,
you know,

177
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:54,250
if as long as it's consensual and, and
not kids, but that was my experience

178
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,083
and

179
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,620
yeah,
really sorry about that.

180
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,770
No, I, I resonate with it as well.
I mean, I was as well, you know,

181
00:12:03,771 --> 00:12:05,850
and there wasn't a family member than God.
However,

182
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:10,851
it's still a enough of a tumultuous
problem that even when I came out as a

183
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:12,831
lesbian,

184
00:12:12,831 --> 00:12:17,720
I wondered if it had to do with that
incident and definitely brought up and

185
00:12:17,721 --> 00:12:19,520
that's why it was the first thing I said,
you know,

186
00:12:19,521 --> 00:12:23,900
cause you no one is
innocent and doesn't know.

187
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:27,220
Yeah,
absolutely.

188
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,650
I believe in a higher power.

189
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:40,460
I'd love to hear it from your
perspective. Oh, why you,

190
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:45,000
why you believe in a higher power?
I mean the household I was raised in,

191
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:47,580
why not, uh, the analogy
of like you can't,

192
00:12:47,581 --> 00:12:51,450
one cannot see level one cannot see
air and it's still there and you know,

193
00:12:51,451 --> 00:12:56,130
started going to more clergyman
and wanting to understand.

194
00:12:56,131 --> 00:13:00,330
Exactly. You know, my ways of being
in the image of a greater creator,

195
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:03,370
understanding I wasn't a mistake.
You know,

196
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,650
cause you know there is a higher source.

197
00:13:04,651 --> 00:13:07,980
There is definitely something that
has given me these blessings that have

198
00:13:07,981 --> 00:13:11,790
nothing to do with me. It has everything
to do with the bigger picture of things.

199
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,650
I think for me, you know, I,

200
00:13:13,651 --> 00:13:18,060
I was also raised in a very strong
religious background and just as I can not

201
00:13:18,061 --> 00:13:22,080
deny this part of me that
was the way I express love.

202
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:26,880
I'd be dishonest if I said that when I
sat down and I prayed and I listened,

203
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,253
I didn't hear,

204
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:30,630
oh no,
it's time for the heathen.

205
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,140
You weren't no mistake.

206
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,630
I resonate with some of
the things you said too.

207
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,580
Like I do believe in a higher power.

208
00:13:39,581 --> 00:13:42,310
I just don't believe in
like a typical higher power.

209
00:13:42,311 --> 00:13:45,640
And I also like highly believe in science.
So I'm like,

210
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:49,660
I believe in gravity as a higher power.
I believe in like entropy is a, you know,

211
00:13:49,661 --> 00:13:50,530
like things that we,

212
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:54,580
that are out of our control and stuff
and I want to always keep searching and

213
00:13:54,581 --> 00:13:59,581
always cute questioning and like always
trying to find like as much love as

214
00:13:59,861 --> 00:14:02,670
possible I guess. And I believe
in other people's gods too. Yeah.

215
00:14:02,671 --> 00:14:04,810
Like I believe in that for y'all.
You know what I mean?

216
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:09,580
Like if that's what makes you a better
person and makes you feel more yourself

217
00:14:09,581 --> 00:14:12,280
and feel more love like I believe in that,
you know,

218
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:16,900
but I can't say that I believe
it for myself cause I, I dunno,

219
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:19,160
I don't want to cast my all my Eczema.

220
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:23,100
Yeah guys, thank you friends. Thank you.

221
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:26,523

222
