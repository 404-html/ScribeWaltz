1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,680
I went in there with just wanting a
nose job and my lips done and he made me

2
00:00:03,681 --> 00:00:05,390
feel like my entire face was messed up.

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:09,110
I left in tears because
I felt I am so hideous.

4
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,660
My name is Shana.
I do anti aging research and consulting.

5
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,050
My Name Is Tanisha Aka the Lego Queen.
Um,

6
00:00:31,051 --> 00:00:35,730
I do a lot of advocacy for
vitiligo awareness. Hi, I'm
Rena and I'm an actress.

7
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,250
My name is Carly.
I'm a healthy lifestyle coach.

8
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,700
My name is Sagar Patel and I'm a facial
plastic surgeon in Beverly hills.

9
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,320
My name is Nicola Lowery.

10
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,950
I am a physician assistant
practicing aesthetic medicine.

11
00:00:46,951 --> 00:00:51,680
I've been practicing for 14 years and
I'm a national trainer for Allergan.

12
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:54,870
The makers of Botox and
fillers and I please

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
have my natural beauty folks on the left
and my cosmetic surgery group on the

14
00:01:00,261 --> 00:01:01,094
right.

15
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:05,443
Yeah,

16
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:15,670
the cosmetic surgery industry
exploits people's insecurities.

17
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:25,260
I don't think the industry as
a whole does it's money, right?

18
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:26,490
So I think there are,

19
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,420
there's the motivation behind women
not feeling good about themselves.

20
00:01:30,421 --> 00:01:34,800
And I do think there are certain companies
and individuals who would exploit

21
00:01:34,801 --> 00:01:38,940
that in order to make it more lucrative
for them. It just makes sense.

22
00:01:38,941 --> 00:01:40,170
That's how businesses work.

23
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,560
Some places where they tell you like bring
out those insecurities because I want

24
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:50,250
them to buy these products. You mean like
in a training they tell you that. Right,

25
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:53,370
and I'm not going to do that to
someone is like, oh well you have this,

26
00:01:53,371 --> 00:01:56,640
this and this wrong.
Maybe you want to fix it.

27
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:01,470
I'm not going to do that to somebody and
create an insecurity in them that maybe

28
00:02:01,471 --> 00:02:04,350
they knew they had and not playing
on it or maybe they didn't know,

29
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,940
but now they do. Definitely. I was
only 18 when I called from my console.

30
00:02:08,941 --> 00:02:13,941
I said I would like to have a consult
for a rhinoplasty and lip injections and

31
00:02:14,581 --> 00:02:18,420
he gave me the,
I needed chicken plans.

32
00:02:18,421 --> 00:02:23,421
I needed to have my brow line shaved down
because changing my nose would change

33
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:28,791
the entire shape of my fees and I felt
very much so like he just saw me as

34
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,553
money.

35
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,633
Okay.

36
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:36,920
There's good doctors and
bad doctors and in the end,

37
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:41,950
the important thing to realize is that
doctors are trying to do good for other

38
00:02:42,711 --> 00:02:44,120
people.
There's exceptions,

39
00:02:44,121 --> 00:02:49,121
but it's a professional society where
our goal is to help other people and you

40
00:02:49,311 --> 00:02:53,620
know, initially going in to the
cosmetic world especially, um,

41
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:56,900
it's a multibillion dollar industry
and as a doctor you're always taught a

42
00:02:56,901 --> 00:02:59,860
couple of laurels from
benevolence to do no harm.

43
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:04,990
Insecurity is inherent in all of us. Some
of us have more, some of us have less,

44
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,360
but it was already there and you know,

45
00:03:07,361 --> 00:03:10,900
does the cosmetic industry
capitalize on our insecurities? Sure.

46
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,430
I think that there is a piece of that,

47
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,530
but as all industries that are just
trying to market to the people that are

48
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,230
going to utilize it, right. Product,

49
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:23,550
I wish I could change
something about my appearance.

50
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,150
Yeah. I feel like, um,

51
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:33,800
just because I want to change something
about myself doesn't necessarily mean

52
00:03:33,801 --> 00:03:38,300
that I don't accept myself.
Those are the thoughts that prompt me to,

53
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:41,540
to work on acceptance of myself.

54
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:46,880
Something that I come across a lot in
my practice is not so much that someone

55
00:03:48,411 --> 00:03:51,290
wants to change the way that they look,
but they want to preserve it.

56
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,500
There's a lot of issues,

57
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,410
especially with women
with the aging process.

58
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,630
It's not so much that they
want to be somebody else,

59
00:03:59,631 --> 00:04:02,810
so they want to look like somebody else,
but they want to stay looking like them.

60
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:07,930
I fully intend to do a facelift when the
time is right and not because I want to

61
00:04:08,241 --> 00:04:09,050
look different,

62
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:13,970
but because I want to continue
to look as young as I feel. Yeah.

63
00:04:13,971 --> 00:04:15,490
I think for me,
um,

64
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:20,560
major decision for me to get cosmetic
surgery was that I was in my early

65
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:26,810
twenties and I had had a massive weight
loss. I naturally lost the weight.

66
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:27,800
Um,

67
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:32,540
I lost 175 pounds and my skin
looked like a nine year old.

68
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:37,470
So for me, I consider it more
like reconstructive and, um,

69
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:42,530
kind of getting back to what I was
supposed to be before I did some damage to

70
00:04:42,531 --> 00:04:47,390
myself. For me. Um,

71
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:52,550
I spent my entire childhood and into
my early adult life wishing I looked

72
00:04:53,161 --> 00:04:55,830
different.
I promised myself that I would never,

73
00:04:55,831 --> 00:04:58,050
ever tell myself I wish I had this.

74
00:04:58,051 --> 00:05:01,480
I wish I looked like this because
I found that triggered, um,

75
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:05,970
things for me that brought back places
that I used to be with my eating disorder.

76
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,340
I think that's great,
and I hope you don't take offense to this,

77
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:12,500
but you're gorgeous.
And I feel like if I was okay,

78
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:16,920
if I was naturally that, like beautiful,
it wouldn't be that hard to like be like,

79
00:05:16,921 --> 00:05:20,070
oh my God, my face is gorgeous. You
know, I'm going to accept myself.

80
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:25,350
There are people who have facial
deformities and embodied to, for me,

81
00:05:25,351 --> 00:05:29,430
it's like w kind of what I consider what
I went through. It's a little harder.

82
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:32,910
Yeah. Oh, definitely. Yes.
Might have a pretty face,

83
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:37,710
but I was always the largest of all of
my friends, the largest of my family,

84
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,860
five years of my life.
I spent constantly,

85
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:44,760
constantly waking up in the morning and
picking apart every single part of my

86
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:48,720
body.
I can't continue this constant,

87
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:53,410
terrible habit of bulemia or I'm
going to die. Yeah. Okay, good.

88
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,150
Just I was horribly believing for a year
and a half, like it was awful. Yeah.

89
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,700
So I got it. Yeah. Yeah. It's not easy.

90
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:05,970
Cosmetic surgery can empower you.

91
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:14,370
I do wish that every woman could wake
up and look in the mirror and be like,

92
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,650
I am so beautiful just the way I am.

93
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:21,680
But I also think that if you can do
something to give yourself that feeling,

94
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:25,820
then that's really great and that,
that is a beautiful thing.

95
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:28,150
So one of the questions we actually
asked on our questionnaires,

96
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,500
what are your motivations for surgery?
And someone who says,

97
00:06:30,501 --> 00:06:31,910
I can't get a boyfriend.
You know,

98
00:06:31,911 --> 00:06:34,870
I'm getting bad grades because
I have this particular look,

99
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,130
they're a bad candidate for surgery.
And you know,

100
00:06:37,131 --> 00:06:38,990
that's part of medical school training.

101
00:06:38,991 --> 00:06:42,680
That's part of becoming a surgeon is
understanding what these triggers are.

102
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:45,140
What are the signs that
tell you as a surgeon,

103
00:06:45,141 --> 00:06:47,480
this is not going to be someone
who's going to be happy afterwards,

104
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,440
whether or not you are
inherently truly happy or not.

105
00:06:50,441 --> 00:06:52,480
I think that's hugely important.

106
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,500
But what if you're a happy person but
you hate your nose or would if you're a

107
00:06:56,501 --> 00:07:01,501
very happy person and you were born with
a cleft palate and you want to be able

108
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:07,291
to project your image to the world
that's congruent with how you feel on the

109
00:07:07,571 --> 00:07:12,571
inside and maybe you're experiencing
negativity because of the way you were

110
00:07:14,891 --> 00:07:16,000
born.
Naturally

111
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:19,480
every day. I experience stories
of empowerment with patients,

112
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:24,481
but for me a particular one comes
essentially from someone who was so

113
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:26,500
okay.

114
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:30,680
Unempowered by her
experiences. This girl, uh,

115
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,120
she was 23 at the time,
um,

116
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:37,240
was beat by her father when
she was younger and sustained
significant trauma to

117
00:07:37,241 --> 00:07:41,260
her nose and helping her and fixing her
nose and the gratitude she showed and

118
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:43,060
realizing that you didn't
help her for that day.

119
00:07:43,061 --> 00:07:46,190
You didn't help her for that week.
It's for the rest of her life. She, it,

120
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:50,130
she can start moving on.
And that empowerment is one of,

121
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:53,170
is a perfect example of
what cosmetic surgery.

122
00:07:53,171 --> 00:07:55,150
And that truly was that it
was just a cosmetic surgery.

123
00:07:55,151 --> 00:07:58,870
It was not so she could breathe.
It wasn't so she could move around better.

124
00:07:58,871 --> 00:08:03,340
It was to make her look a certain way
so she doesn't have to remember that

125
00:08:03,341 --> 00:08:04,174
experience.

126
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:09,870
There's too much pressure on
women to look a certain way.

127
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,290
We live in a instant life now with,

128
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:22,320
you know we have dating apps or you can
swipe hundreds of people a day and you

129
00:08:22,511 --> 00:08:22,721
know,

130
00:08:22,721 --> 00:08:27,721
you can go online and post a good
selfie of yourself and get you know,

131
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:33,730
hundreds of likes and you feel like
there's so much pressure to look and be a

132
00:08:34,451 --> 00:08:36,220
certain way,
like you can never fall.

133
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,760
Kind of looked at the way that
things have changed around pregnancy.

134
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,540
A lot of women now want to go
and have a baby with a beat face.

135
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,540
Like everything's perfect.
It's about the perfect picture.

136
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:51,160
I have to have my makeup and my brows now.
I understand some things.

137
00:08:51,161 --> 00:08:54,370
You just want to be perfect.
I get it. I want to,

138
00:08:54,371 --> 00:08:59,371
I want to be able just embrace the moments
with my child and not worry about all

139
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:04,240
this makeup. I have one right now. I think
we've been kind of comparing, you know,

140
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:07,240
say the 25 year old to the 25 year old,

141
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:12,270
but then let's think about the women that
are middle aged and are having to keep

142
00:09:13,091 --> 00:09:16,450
up with the younger girls,

143
00:09:16,451 --> 00:09:20,740
it to try and still feel attractive
and relevant. And I do see that a lot,

144
00:09:20,741 --> 00:09:25,350
even with my clientele. I have women that
are married to very wealthy men. Yeah.

145
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:30,490
And that their greatest fear is that
they will end up becoming the second wife

146
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:34,750
because the new and improved wife is
on her way in and she's on her way out.

147
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:40,080
So this pressure to maintain youth and
beauty and relevance is so huge for not

148
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:45,170
really realizing that it's that men,
there's a jerk

149
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:50,240
and it's like, it's my,
it's not the, it's not us.

150
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:52,160
It's really the person that you're with.

151
00:09:52,161 --> 00:09:57,161
And so I think that always happened
to keep up with the Joneses and always

152
00:09:57,411 --> 00:09:58,160
wanted to just like,

153
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,180
I have to look this way because this
person has to love me and if this person

154
00:10:02,181 --> 00:10:04,880
doesn't love me,
I'm going to have to,

155
00:10:04,881 --> 00:10:09,410
I have to make myself be
who he loves to take it to.

156
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:10,243
A lot of pressure.

157
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,020
Yeah,

158
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,760
I am beautiful.

159
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:19,173
Okay.

160
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,620
Okay. So I'm going to go first because I
woke up this morning and I really loved

161
00:10:22,621 --> 00:10:26,490
myself with me having a bit of Lego.
It took a long time.

162
00:10:26,491 --> 00:10:29,550
When I first was diagnosed at five,
no one knew what it was.

163
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,000
Everyone thought Michael Jackson
made it up. It's a real thing.

164
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,320
No one knew that it was real.

165
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:37,800
So a lot of people's first
time encountering would
it actually look like in

166
00:10:37,801 --> 00:10:41,680
person was me. I took a long
time for me to get to this point.

167
00:10:41,681 --> 00:10:45,570
So where I'm just like,
oh, I love who I am.

168
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:49,080
I'm super beautiful for things that I do.

169
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:53,920
Not particularly how I look,
how cute he is ever. You know,

170
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,430
my browser. Nice. And you know, that's it.

171
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,440
But I feel still beautiful for the way
that I make other people feel and just

172
00:11:02,521 --> 00:11:07,520
hike how I love myself. One of the
things that happened with me, um,

173
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,650
gaining the weight really fast and then
losing it really fast as I have a lot of

174
00:11:10,651 --> 00:11:15,090
stretch marks. I have a friend who's
really into body positivity and um,

175
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,320
she's a photographer and she took pictures
of these ugly parts of me and she's

176
00:11:19,321 --> 00:11:22,380
just like, wow, that is so beautiful.

177
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,330
And like I could see through her eyes,

178
00:11:24,331 --> 00:11:26,970
like I'm starting to
see myself in that way.

179
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:30,600
Even those things that will never get
fixed, there is no way to fix them.

180
00:11:30,601 --> 00:11:35,100
There was no way to replace my skin
with other skin. It's different,

181
00:11:35,101 --> 00:11:36,090
but it's beautiful.

182
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:39,940
There's one message that I
wanted to get out to men today.

183
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:43,120
A simple thing like someone telling you,
you look beautiful without being creepy,

184
00:11:43,121 --> 00:11:46,120
of course. Um, but someone just
telling you, you look beautiful.

185
00:11:46,121 --> 00:11:47,320
All of you guys look beautiful.

186
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:50,350
That makes a big difference to everyone
and tell people they're beautiful

187
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,380
because men are beautiful too.
Correct.

188
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,250
Thank you guys for this experience.
You guys are amazing.

189
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:03,003
Thank you guys.

190
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:14,620
Hi Guys. My name is Aaron
and I'm from jubilee media.

191
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:19,120
I really hope you enjoyed this video
and took something away from both sides.

192
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:23,380
We really try to encourage people to
listen to others because we believe that's

193
00:12:23,381 --> 00:12:26,830
the first step to change.
And so check out our other work.

194
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:31,330
Tell us what you think below and we
hope you will watch another video of our

195
00:12:31,331 --> 00:12:31,730
soon.
