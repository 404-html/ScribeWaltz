1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,010
What are you putting in your body?
Dead carcass pain, suffering.

2
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:19,630
Can I have all of my vegans go into that
pool of light and my non vegans are in

3
00:00:19,631 --> 00:00:20,464
that pool?

4
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,640
First statement,

5
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:31,630
taste plays a big factor
in my eating choices.

6
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,513
Okay.

7
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,010
Yeah,
I mean that's a huge thing for me.

8
00:00:39,011 --> 00:00:42,760
I think it's one of my weaknesses
is actually like butter, salt.

9
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:43,870
It's one of my weaknesses.

10
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:49,120
I love food and I think my relationship
with food actually deepened when I

11
00:00:49,461 --> 00:00:53,750
became Vegan. I don't think I
appreciated it as much as I did before.

12
00:00:53,751 --> 00:00:54,680
I was Vegan.

13
00:00:55,240 --> 00:01:00,240
My name is Ari Davis and I have been
vegetarian for 24 years and Vegan for 13

14
00:01:01,001 --> 00:01:01,834
years.

15
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:06,710
I believe that humans are
the top of the food chain.

16
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:17,290
It's a human at the same level of
equivalence is like a fish. Right.

17
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,760
This is probably a big reason why I'm
not vegan anymore. Right? Is I didn't,

18
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,870
I couldn't,
I didn't see that.

19
00:01:21,871 --> 00:01:26,730
I had to see myself at our
moral equivalent of a fish
and it gets into moral

20
00:01:26,731 --> 00:01:27,830
questions like,
you know,

21
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,710
why should we have a pet that's
a dog rather than eat the dog?

22
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:36,540
And I think the most important question
is why should I love my neighbor rather

23
00:01:36,541 --> 00:01:39,390
than eat my neighbor?
My name's Steve Michelle [inaudible].

24
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:44,430
I was a Vegan for a year.
I was a vegetarian for two years.

25
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,160
I am a mediator now.
I've been so for over five years,

26
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:51,310
like I don't even see like what is like
a food chain, you know what I'm saying?

27
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:54,570
That's just some construct some guy made
and put a little diagram and put us the

28
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:55,810
human beings in the top.
So

29
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,240
I don't think it's a question
of whether we're at the top.

30
00:01:58,241 --> 00:02:01,360
I think it's a question of
what do you do with that?

31
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:05,710
If you have a more conscious
energy than an animal,

32
00:02:05,711 --> 00:02:06,940
what do you do with that power?

33
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:10,900
Do you choose to take a life
or do you choose to live in

34
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:12,643
love?

35
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:16,670
I put a lot of thought into my meals.

36
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,630
The way I support my body and my
health is extremely important.

37
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:29,610
I don't find that I can function at
my best either. Healthy, productive,

38
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:30,810
emotionally stable,

39
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:35,370
intellectually capable unless I have
a lot of proper nutrients in my diet.

40
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:38,490
Six years ago I became
Vegan because I got sick.

41
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:42,910
I started to realize that my health
is directly attached to what I ate.

42
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:43,841
Since then,

43
00:02:43,841 --> 00:02:47,200
my friends and family have supported me
to feeling better and I'm better than I

44
00:02:47,201 --> 00:02:51,010
was before I got sick. Uh, I don't
really like cook or anything,

45
00:02:51,011 --> 00:02:54,130
so I don't really put too
much thought into what I eat.

46
00:02:54,131 --> 00:02:58,420
I guess I live a fast paced kind of like
I'm working late nights or I'm waking

47
00:02:58,421 --> 00:03:00,040
up early.
Sometimes it's easier

48
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:05,040
to grab this quick process sandwich
or I wish I planned my meals out more.

49
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,260
I think I would be a lot.
I would feel a lot better.

50
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,960
I think it's will be powerful
no matter what you're eating,

51
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,320
to put your intentions into whether it's
prayer in vocation and it's just such

52
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:17,890
great power in presence versus
just like scarfing something down.

53
00:03:17,891 --> 00:03:19,630
But like can I just really
be present with this meal,

54
00:03:19,631 --> 00:03:21,070
take my time and chew it slowly.

55
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:24,910
So that's the first one that I
resonate with and what I choose.

56
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,850
I would kill an animal.

57
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:33,230
Okay.

58
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:36,380
I think there'd be tons of context
where I'd kill an animal. Like if a,

59
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,800
if a lion is going to go kill a baby,
I'd probably kill an animal.

60
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:42,980
I'd kill an animal to save a human life
and I get the vegans probably wouldn't

61
00:03:42,981 --> 00:03:47,981
do that if I could do something to
prevent killing them besides eating them.

62
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,570
Like if I was protecting
myself and we had to,

63
00:03:50,571 --> 00:03:55,550
we had it like a something that we
could do to get that animal away.

64
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:59,060
I would definitely try to not kill it.
I mean,

65
00:03:59,061 --> 00:04:01,670
I feel like it comes down to you or
the animal. You're killing the animal.

66
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,290
I would,
I would.

67
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,870
They're going to give up
their life for the fish.

68
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:12,040
Why is it always the case when talking
about what I kill an animal like exactly

69
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:16,570
what you were in a client's wandering
around downtown La when I was in the

70
00:04:16,571 --> 00:04:19,600
hiking. There's, there's mountain
lions are coming kit and kill people.

71
00:04:19,601 --> 00:04:21,770
You've known that, right? That's
an orange county, but that's not,

72
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,680
that's not in the jungle in Africa.

73
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:30,250
Did you kill an animal? It's an orange
county. Mountain lions have killed hikers.

74
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:33,850
Kids. What'd you just let them
know? We'll let the guest die.

75
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,680
We're hiking in the mountains
and there's a mountain lion.

76
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,790
I have to be aware of the fact that I'm
in mountain lion territory and be like,

77
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,840
I'm okay with the risk because to be
honest, I'm not hiking with a gun.

78
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:48,700
I have no way to defend my friend. Yeah,
you don't hike with Nike, Paul? I've been,

79
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:52,060
I don't call against a mountain lion.
I don't think your wedding, I just,

80
00:04:52,061 --> 00:04:56,440
I just want to say like even if I
did and even if my attempt were to be

81
00:04:56,441 --> 00:05:01,150
successful, I would feel awful.
Having killed the mountain lion.

82
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:04,580
What were your feelings or your just
foundation then for your beliefs then?

83
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:08,680
100% or if human beings,
animals. Yes, yes, sure.

84
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,650
Would you kill another human being
to save another human being? Yes.

85
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:14,350
What makes one person more
valid as a student to another?

86
00:05:14,351 --> 00:05:17,140
Is it your relationship to
that person? It would, yeah.

87
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,540
It would probably be so if for example,

88
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:22,720
I raise an animal in the wild,

89
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:27,100
it's like an animal I've
built a relationship with
and that animal now threatens

90
00:05:27,101 --> 00:05:30,640
the life of a human being, but I don't
know, but I have no man. It's entire life.

91
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:34,390
What makes killing that
animal as just cause. Okay.

92
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,810
As opposed to saving that life.
I have a,

93
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,380
I have a longer relationship
with that animal.

94
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,810
Why would I kill the animal
before I'd save that person?

95
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,600
Like it's about relationship.
You killed him.

96
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:47,020
A person over an animal because I
believe human beings are animals.

97
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,770
NASA humans at a different level,
but maybe a bell.

98
00:05:49,771 --> 00:05:53,230
He fish at the same level as a person.
Hey, we see it very different. I do.

99
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:58,070
It costs more than it should eat healthy.

100
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:11,030
It's more expensive to eat healthy.
I don't think it's too expensive.

101
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:14,450
Farmer's market is something that
I'm trying to frequent more. Oh.

102
00:06:14,451 --> 00:06:15,440
But sometimes you know,

103
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:20,470
you can go spend $20 here and
definitely not get as much.

104
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,420
Um, I definitely want
to see that, you know,

105
00:06:23,421 --> 00:06:27,140
maybe that'll encourage people to eat a
little healthier if you can go grab that

106
00:06:27,141 --> 00:06:31,670
fresh fruit, fresh veggies
for five, 10 bucks, you know,

107
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,210
I think,
uh,

108
00:06:33,211 --> 00:06:37,910
our culture as a society is just in
grade towards like the fast food culture.

109
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,750
It was just cheap and accessible.

110
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:44,780
But now I think we have more of a
established like medical basis on what's

111
00:06:44,911 --> 00:06:46,230
healthy and what's not healthy.

112
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:50,930
And to get that content and to
have it be tasty as well is,

113
00:06:50,931 --> 00:06:51,870
is expensive.

114
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,080
I'm running it. I have so much to say.
It does not cost more money to be Vegan.

115
00:06:57,081 --> 00:07:02,030
That is a myth. It takes planning.
Yes. The convenience is last.

116
00:07:02,031 --> 00:07:06,050
Can you grab a hamburger at
Mcdonald's for sure for 99 cents,

117
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,190
but k how much lentils can you buy?
The issue is capitalism.

118
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,620
Like that is what is
keeping us where we are.

119
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:15,380
It's not that humans are smarter and
they're going to come up with this

120
00:07:15,381 --> 00:07:18,980
technology. The technology
exists. It is there.

121
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,530
We can feed so many people.

122
00:07:21,531 --> 00:07:24,590
It is capitalism and factory farming

123
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:28,270
and most of these companies that are
selling us products that are like shitty

124
00:07:28,271 --> 00:07:31,360
food, they don't give a fuck
about you at all period.

125
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,280
Someone sitting on the island somewhere.
Oh yeah,

126
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:35,700
like just stacking bread and
then Paul this fast foods,

127
00:07:35,701 --> 00:07:38,440
she eating really healthy food
and they probably even real good.

128
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,420
Yeah,
they're not eating any of that shit.

129
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,000
You go to certain neighborhoods, certain
areas you don't see the same fast food.

130
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:48,080
You don't see the same restaurant
and it's all for a reason. Yeah,

131
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:51,510
no stability. I mean, yeah, that's a
good point. It's like they don't have,

132
00:07:51,511 --> 00:07:54,030
why is there many health food
stores in the hood? I come,

133
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:57,540
I can't like get an option wise is
liquor store anywhere and it's true.

134
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:58,081
It's like you have to,

135
00:07:58,081 --> 00:08:02,220
when you break it down there's like
malicious intent to d harmonize and like

136
00:08:02,221 --> 00:08:06,120
lower the vibration of certain people
and certain areas and it's like that's a

137
00:08:06,121 --> 00:08:09,810
part of it too. It's like,
what am I contributing to?
Sure. I'll say this. You know,

138
00:08:09,811 --> 00:08:13,980
when I was 11 years old, my father
passed away from his second heart attack.

139
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,420
He was diabetic.

140
00:08:15,421 --> 00:08:18,300
He was pissing out of a two by watching
him deteriorate my youngest years of my

141
00:08:18,301 --> 00:08:20,700
life for like years and years,
just a tear rate,

142
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:24,810
taking pharmaceutical drugs and just
kind of basically dying slowly because of

143
00:08:24,811 --> 00:08:28,980
what he chose to eight to me, I'd rather
spend an extra dollar. I need her again,

144
00:08:28,981 --> 00:08:31,860
nick or something.
Helping now and live longer.

145
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:35,130
Then try to cut corners when you know

146
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:40,470
in the end twice now instead of later. In
the end, my mom was same thing. She died.

147
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,990
She was eating buckets of ice
cream when she passed away.

148
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,480
She died at 49 years old.
Wow.

149
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:50,190
Now choose no,

150
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:56,160
the more education now we can put out
there. Just like stuff like is beautiful.

151
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,490
That's what I was most anxious about is
learning more of what I'm trying to step

152
00:08:59,491 --> 00:09:02,370
into.
I don't know if I'll ever give up chicken.

153
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,560
I'm just going to be honest with you.
I don't know.

154
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,600
I want to eat a lot cleaner chicken.
Do you guys have like cheat days ever?

155
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,950
Hell No.

156
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:15,630
I am Vegan 100% at the front line.

157
00:09:15,631 --> 00:09:17,610
Ethical reasons, always, always, always.

158
00:09:17,611 --> 00:09:20,400
And that's why I don't think in
24 years I've ever fought back.

159
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:23,940
It was hard to try new things.
Things I didn't like,

160
00:09:23,941 --> 00:09:26,100
found a tons of feed and
food. I was like, Oh God,

161
00:09:26,101 --> 00:09:27,300
what the fuck are you people eat it.

162
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:31,290
And then simultaneously realizing
that there was options. You know,

163
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:33,870
there's always choices and it's always
choices you make. Like you said,

164
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,630
you may never give up me um,
fully,

165
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:40,230
but it's like you're making a choice to
or at least thinking for yourself and

166
00:09:40,231 --> 00:09:40,991
making a decision.

167
00:09:40,991 --> 00:09:44,310
Then like that's all you can ask
people to do is think for themselves.

168
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,510
Really appreciate each and every one
of you all. Thank you. No problem.

169
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,460
Thank you.
Thank you.

170
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:57,340
No, thank you for coming
out. Nice to meet you ladies.

171
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:02,290
What's up guys? I have a Mari and I
am Jason. And am I a question for you?

172
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,880
You have a question for me.
What do you like about middle ground?

173
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:11,170
What I like about middle ground is seeing
people come together and like realize

174
00:10:11,171 --> 00:10:14,800
that their labels are not the whole,
some of their very experienced,

175
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:16,350
like take it off,
take it off the labels,

176
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:19,330
realizing there's so much more than
their labels. That's right. I love that.

177
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:19,780
All right,

178
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:24,160
well tell us in the comments below why
you love middle ground and if you've been

179
00:10:24,161 --> 00:10:28,180
a label they want to take off and throw
on the ground, tell us that as well. Uh,

180
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:30,610
