1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,150
We actually aren't looking for
a middle ground with capitalism.

2
00:00:03,151 --> 00:00:07,500
We're not looking for a lighter,
gentler oppression, exploitation,

3
00:00:07,501 --> 00:00:09,960
racism.
We are seeking revolution.

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,083
Yeah.

5
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,273
Okay.

6
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:36,500
My name is liberty. I'm studying
psychology at Ucla. I'm 20 years old.

7
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:41,200
I'm Sean. I'm 24 years old and
I'm in the Socialist Party.

8
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:46,040
My name's Mimi. Uh, 2016. I was the
Socialist Party's presidential candidate.

9
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:50,540
Uh, um, Shea and I'm with the
Socialist Party and I'm 28.

10
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:52,880
My name is Jack.
I'm 19.

11
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:57,740
I go to community college
and name's Richard 19.

12
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,250
I go to cal state long beach as a
chemistry major with a music minor. Hey,

13
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:06,380
get my socialists on the left and
Mike Capitalists on the right.

14
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:10,893
Okay.

15
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,570
Humans are inherently selfish.

16
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:23,980
Selfishness is sort of one word for it,
but looking out for yourself,

17
00:01:23,981 --> 00:01:26,180
your own survival in your own gain.
Um,

18
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:30,190
and of course that includes the gain
of those you love is one of the main

19
00:01:30,191 --> 00:01:33,010
motivators of people.

20
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,400
A really good way that we could figure
out human nature is by comparing it to

21
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,570
animal nature and stuff like
that. And you see, you know,

22
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:41,320
animals doing whatever
they can to survive.

23
00:01:41,321 --> 00:01:46,060
It's just culture that has changed us.
But I believe at its core that yes,

24
00:01:46,061 --> 00:01:49,150
humans just like any other
animal or I sell fish.

25
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,053
Yeah.

26
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,120
I work with children and my experience
of working with people who haven't been a

27
00:01:58,121 --> 00:02:03,121
culture made it or have done in into this
idea that they need to be selfish all

28
00:02:03,351 --> 00:02:07,850
the time are generally not every organism
has to have a sense of like getting

29
00:02:07,851 --> 00:02:09,740
resources for itself
and we're just survive.

30
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:13,160
But that's a much different
than being selfish I think.

31
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,970
I think even if you look at, if you
spend any time in a social democracy,

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,361
you know,

33
00:02:17,361 --> 00:02:21,950
let's say you go to Norway and you spend
time there where the people see, um,

34
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:27,490
the collective good, uh, as tied into
their own personal wellbeing. You know,

35
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:32,580
I think we have so many examples like
that societies working collectively toward

36
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:34,040
a greater good.

37
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:38,810
The thing about the Nordic
countries and my opinion is, well,

38
00:02:38,811 --> 00:02:43,370
since there's very, very ethnically
homogenous, they all have very,

39
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:44,870
very similar culture.

40
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:49,280
It's not an accurate representation
of what humans inherently are.

41
00:02:49,281 --> 00:02:53,720
Because I believe that culture
can mask um, human nature.

42
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,840
So you think that that diversity would
work against working in harmony towards a

43
00:02:59,261 --> 00:03:00,094
collective good

44
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,940
in diversity?
We have different ideas of what good is.

45
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,290
I think competition brings
out the best in people,

46
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:20,750
especially when you know we're competing
for something like let's try to come

47
00:03:20,751 --> 00:03:22,880
create this compound
that could help you know,

48
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,070
the masses and some kind
of health relation form.

49
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:28,430
You have all these research labs trying
to figure out what's the most efficient

50
00:03:28,431 --> 00:03:31,430
way to figure out this process.
What's the most efficient way to do this?

51
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:34,940
I think we need more of that
sort of sense of competition,

52
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:36,610
especially in the sciences and whatnot.

53
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:41,570
You know, we frequently hear
about the evils of monopolies.
It's because you know,

54
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:46,580
with, when you control an entire
market, why even bother being better,

55
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,770
anything.
You've got no competition,

56
00:03:48,771 --> 00:03:52,280
you've got nothing to strive for and
and no one can choose anything else.

57
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,710
I agree with you both on
the examples that you gave,

58
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:57,440
but the thing that I'm
kind of struggling with,

59
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:01,580
I mean if we're talking about
efficiency, quality, then yeah,

60
00:04:01,581 --> 00:04:03,560
I think it brings out the best in people,
but then again,

61
00:04:03,561 --> 00:04:04,670
it tends to bring about greed.

62
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:08,470
Okay.

63
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:11,430
Y'All do a such a great service. Uh, it's,

64
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:16,210
it's a trip to me because as you're
likely aware that there's this growing

65
00:04:16,211 --> 00:04:20,980
support for socialism and economic system
that places people over profit that

66
00:04:20,981 --> 00:04:24,790
you're willing to continue to throw out
the same talking points that have failed

67
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:28,430
people so miserably. Uh, again, it's,

68
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:31,510
it's a benefit to us and I
guess we should say thank you.

69
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,133
Nice.

70
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:36,960
If you care about something,
if you're passionate about something,

71
00:04:36,961 --> 00:04:41,010
you don't need the threat of someone
doing it better than you to do the best

72
00:04:41,011 --> 00:04:41,401
that you can do.

73
00:04:41,401 --> 00:04:46,401
Ask any creative competition leads less
to excellence and more towards doing

74
00:04:48,001 --> 00:04:50,340
whatever you can.
Did edge past the other person.

75
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:51,250
Yeah.

76
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:55,690
Today everyone has the
opportunity for success.

77
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:00,563
Yes.

78
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:01,941
All right.

79
00:05:01,941 --> 00:05:05,030
If we're talking about the United
States and we're talking about financial

80
00:05:05,031 --> 00:05:08,960
success, then yes, I would believe
so. If we're talking about the world,

81
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:13,010
it doesn't necessarily have to mean
financial wellbeing or like stability.

82
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:16,640
I think that it really just means how
you're happy and how you're okay with

83
00:05:16,641 --> 00:05:17,660
yourself and you know,

84
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,950
you make a goal and you pursue your goal
and if you fail or a t exactly what I

85
00:05:21,951 --> 00:05:22,580
was thinking.

86
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:26,690
I find that there are so many resources
out there that you can enact on.

87
00:05:26,691 --> 00:05:30,200
It's just, there's some people who
just don't do anything about it.

88
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,030
Okay.

89
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:36,900
My first thought here with this collection
is, you gotta be fucking kidding me.

90
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:39,240
Uh, you know, um,

91
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,800
so many people in this country
who solely because they exist,

92
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,730
they're under threat. Whether it's
through, you know, the police,

93
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:49,950
they're just trying to survive.
So

94
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,410
everyone's very different.
Again,

95
00:05:51,411 --> 00:05:55,950
everyone has different communities to
what they can even consider a success in,

96
00:05:55,951 --> 00:06:00,951
in the u s though are a lot of
opportunities for most people though.

97
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:02,180
Of course,

98
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:06,320
you can't say all and there are always
those who are extremely unfortunate and

99
00:06:06,321 --> 00:06:07,190
GB helped.

100
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,380
I'm sure every one of us was sat
in a restaurant before Starbucks.

101
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:16,620
Those people who work their asses off
any of these low income jobs are not easy

102
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:22,360
and they work for pennies. If something
goes wrong with their car, they're done.

103
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:25,830
You know, if they have a health
problem, they're done. You're,

104
00:06:25,831 --> 00:06:27,730
you're talking about
financial success though.

105
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,810
Success is extremely relative and can
be defined in many different ways in a

106
00:06:31,811 --> 00:06:36,010
capitalist society that wasn't financial
success, the most important thing. No, I,

107
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:39,730
I've worked in the food industry for a
number of years and I can not say that

108
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:44,790
any one of my companions
was ever happy to be doing.

109
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:49,300
And if they're going to school on
top of that, you know, so they're,

110
00:06:49,301 --> 00:06:52,630
they're working full time and on top of
that they're going to school and their

111
00:06:52,631 --> 00:06:54,790
pants school,
I would consider that successful.

112
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:57,550
If you can go to school and you can
maintain your GPA and you can also be

113
00:06:57,551 --> 00:07:00,460
working a part time job and somehow
affording your school. Yeah,

114
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:01,960
you're doing well in life,

115
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:06,990
society should help the underprivileged.

116
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:13,893
Okay.

117
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:18,750
That sort of saying, give a
man a fish, etc. Holds true.

118
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:19,740
Um,

119
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:24,120
and also who should do the
helping and how is very important,

120
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:27,720
not all acts of service
are equally beneficial.

121
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,720
I would agree to that. I myself, you know,
I'm sorry to use a personal anecdote,

122
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:36,860
anecdotes here, but I've personally
dealt with the fact that, oh,

123
00:07:36,861 --> 00:07:40,820
giving someone this much aid,
they become, they become lazy.

124
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:45,230
My father is an alcoholic,
so we,

125
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:49,480
since due to an injury in his leg,
he gets SSI and what's in,

126
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,520
what ends up happening is he receives
enough SSI to the point where he's not,

127
00:07:55,580 --> 00:08:00,320
he's not motivated to do anything else
beyond just going home drinking a beer or

128
00:08:00,321 --> 00:08:04,520
something like that. And I think,
yes, people should help people,

129
00:08:04,521 --> 00:08:08,300
especially if they're under
underprivileged or they
need the resources to push

130
00:08:08,301 --> 00:08:12,080
them put to what end.
That's, that's the fine line.

131
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:16,850
But your personal anecdote only only
covers the small demographic of the,

132
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:20,830
of the alcoholic. Most of the
people that, that, that uh, oh boy

133
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:25,150
you guys have brought up
has been specifically about
people who are particularly

134
00:08:25,151 --> 00:08:28,900
poor when most of the country is middle,

135
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,600
lower middle class and
up hats. Lots. Actually,

136
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:34,690
that's not a fact that
you would focus on this.

137
00:08:34,691 --> 00:08:39,691
And a con in a shitty one that gives more
than half of its budget to the police

138
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:44,200
in a country that just
passed the military bill,

139
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,550
a spending bill that's almost $1 trillion,

140
00:08:48,551 --> 00:08:51,370
that money goes to defense contractors.

141
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:56,450
Government paying for things is not
capitalism, but we're in a capitalist, uh,

142
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,520
where the government pays huge
amounts of money for the military.

143
00:08:59,521 --> 00:09:01,530
You're talking driver of those things.

144
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:04,320
How about instead of spending
the money on the military,

145
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:09,120
how about putting those back into basic
means? Healthcare, education, housing.

146
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,020
I agree.

147
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:14,700
The government taking our taxpayer dollars
and funneling it into they're paying

148
00:09:14,701 --> 00:09:17,550
for things at the military
explicitly says that they don't need,

149
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:21,720
that's not capitalism is about
prices and transparency and,

150
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,640
and choices. When we got him
and takes her money and buys it,

151
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,680
they decided to blow some working.
That is not,

152
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,090
that might be what you call capitalism.
But when I come here and say, well,

153
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,770
I'm a capitalist,
I'm not saying I'm in favor of that

154
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:41,020
profit.
An ethics are opposing motives.

155
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:49,560
So I think at it's core to profit,
uh, you have to exploit. Uh,

156
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:53,210
and again there is nothing
ethical about exploitation.

157
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:54,510
Yeah. I mean I can't think of, I,

158
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:59,511
I'm really having trouble thinking of a
situation where someone could profit off

159
00:09:59,591 --> 00:10:01,780
of something with that expectation
being in the mix and I just, I,

160
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:06,410
I'm running out of ideas. If you're
running a business and you know, you're,

161
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,730
you're the one up top,

162
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:12,790
you would obviously walk away with more
money if you pay your employees a little

163
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:13,874
bit less.

164
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:22,290
I think that profit in ethics can be
intertwined when seen with the corporate

165
00:10:23,771 --> 00:10:27,820
social responsibility module,
when they treat their employees better,

166
00:10:27,821 --> 00:10:29,320
they give them more benefits.

167
00:10:29,321 --> 00:10:34,321
They raise their wages and in turn it
motivates the workers to work harder.

168
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:40,770
And treating your employees better than
shit is not necessarily ethical like

169
00:10:44,051 --> 00:10:45,160
raising the quality.

170
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,950
It does not mean that you've phrased
it to a sufficient standard of,

171
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:50,530
of treatment. Because if you're paying
someone less than a living wage,

172
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,160
that is unethical.
All I'm saying is it is to some degree,

173
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:59,170
more ethical and can be seen as more
ethical to be beating competition by

174
00:11:00,611 --> 00:11:04,660
raising the wages of your employees
and giving them better benefits.

175
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:05,683
I'll also,

176
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:10,750
one must be paid slightly less than they
are making in worth for a company for

177
00:11:12,591 --> 00:11:14,510
it to be worth it,
to hire them at all.

178
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:20,420
If you can't pay your employee the
minimum amount of money that they need in

179
00:11:20,421 --> 00:11:24,520
order to live a, you have no
business being in business. Um,

180
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:29,620
and I think also there's a tendency from
the conservative side to skew away from

181
00:11:30,051 --> 00:11:34,730
sort of objective fact. I mentioned
the MIT living wage calculator, right?

182
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:39,440
Yes. That's a scientific model.
Wow. That 29 25 so as a company,

183
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,470
if you can't afford to pay
your employees a living wage,

184
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:46,470
that's just the minimum that they
need in order to live. Right. Ah,

185
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:47,990
get the fuck out of business.

186
00:11:47,991 --> 00:11:50,420
Why are we even talking to you when you
have all the facts and we don't know

187
00:11:50,421 --> 00:11:53,860
anything? I don't know. Hardly
worth my time. Well, we would,

188
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:59,120
sure it's hard to really lean towards
one side or the other if everyone is just

189
00:12:01,101 --> 00:12:06,101
sort of stating all these coherent biases
and not accepting any sort of thing

190
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:11,720
from any other particular side,
which is why I'm sort of just,

191
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:15,650
I'm trying to understand your
side and I'm trying to understand,

192
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:18,800
grasp really my side of it.
And again,

193
00:12:18,801 --> 00:12:23,120
going back to sort of that mutual
understanding of what can we do next,

194
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:26,340
that sort of mutual understanding
needs to be there. If,

195
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:31,280
if we're going to ever continue
to see what's best for,

196
00:12:31,281 --> 00:12:33,200
for the US.

197
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,620
Well I think one reason why,
you know,

198
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:39,170
you often see like folks in the left
and socialist communist, anarchist, sir,

199
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:43,960
et Cetera, uh, they're so passionate
and there is anger, you know, um,

200
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:48,580
seeing the suffering and the oppression
and the exploitation, the racism,

201
00:12:48,581 --> 00:12:51,910
et Cetera. You're sort of
feel this urgency, you know,

202
00:12:51,911 --> 00:12:56,911
like we're constantly under sort of
this self criticism and self reflection

203
00:12:57,671 --> 00:12:58,504
about like,

204
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:02,950
well how do you package what can be
complex ideas into ways that are very

205
00:13:02,951 --> 00:13:03,581
palatable.

206
00:13:03,581 --> 00:13:08,200
And I think every hour and I think
like if there is a failure on the left,

207
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:09,790
that would be one of them.

208
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:15,090
I wish that rather than having an
agenda that we try to prove and we see

209
00:13:15,341 --> 00:13:18,070
ourselves as a winning by
convincing the opponent,

210
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:23,520
I wish that we could consider winning
as finding the middle ground and finding

211
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:25,960
where we're similar and finding the truth.

212
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:27,730
I think if you're in the pursuit of truth,

213
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:32,170
then you've won contrary to convincing
other people that you're right. You know?

214
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:36,880
Despite that we definitely disagree on
pretty much everything. It's good to know.

215
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:41,860
The real common ground here is where's
is like millennials and Gen z and stuff.

216
00:13:41,861 --> 00:13:44,620
We're actually,
we're actually like talking about this,

217
00:13:44,621 --> 00:13:47,590
like whether we were able to convince
the other side of anything or not,

218
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,280
at least we give a shit about it.
You know?

219
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,870
This is stuff that we
needed to talk about this,

220
00:13:52,871 --> 00:13:55,990
this stuff that we need to be aware
of, especially given our leaders. So.

221
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:01,240
All right guys. That's a wrap. Thank you.

222
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,110
Really do.
You're cool people.

223
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,183
Okay.

224
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,700
Hey guys, thanks for watching the episode.
The middle ground here at jubilee,

225
00:14:11,701 --> 00:14:13,770
we believe in this idea
of radical empathy,

226
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:15,480
and that is what middle
ground is all about.

227
00:14:15,481 --> 00:14:18,660
So we want to hear your thoughts
on this topic and this discussion.
