1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,510
You are, you're painting a fantasy.
You see it as a fantasy. I mean,

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:06,480
I think the fantasy is using the system
to think that it's going to bend to our

3
00:00:06,481 --> 00:00:07,314
will.

4
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:21,463
Okay.

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,960
Uh, my name is Derek Bros. I'm
33 I'm from Houston, Texas.

6
00:00:25,961 --> 00:00:28,950
I'm a journalist and an activist.
My name is Kaitlin.

7
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,730
I'm originally from the bay area,
but I just,

8
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,170
we were down and I am 21 years old.

9
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:38,540
I'm Andrew. I am 27 years old. I'm from
Scandia, Minnesota and I'm a documentary

10
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:39,443
filmmaker.

11
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:44,790
I am Telisa Ray on 42 and I'm
a senior analyst for a utility.

12
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:48,190
My name is [inaudible].

13
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:52,960
I'm 21 and I am a student.

14
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:54,440
My name is Renada.

15
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:58,580
I'm 24 I'm from Pennsylvania and
I worked for a software company.

16
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:02,970
Can I give my folders on the left side?

17
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,660
And mine is on the right side.

18
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,043
Bye.

19
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:20,540
Okay.

20
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:20,810
Well,

21
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:25,810
I believe my vote matters because I'm a
woman and first it was denied for us and

22
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,950
now I have the opportunity to
use my voice. But in addition,

23
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:35,450
I'm able to use my voice as a black woman.
Excuse me.

24
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:37,160
I get a little emotional about that.

25
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:41,330
Considering though we were citizens
black people long time ago,

26
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:46,390
we weren't given really the right or we
were denied x accessibility to go to the

27
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:52,541
voting polls until I feel like it is
my opportunity to go ahead and speak.

28
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,630
I have the ability to vote,

29
00:01:55,660 --> 00:02:00,250
I have the privilege of civil so
I will do so and like growing up,

30
00:02:00,251 --> 00:02:00,890
like my,

31
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:04,810
my oldest sister wasn't able to vote
until like a couple of years ago because

32
00:02:04,811 --> 00:02:09,790
he's autistic and since it's the whole
guardianship thing and it was actually

33
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:14,170
until a couple of years ago that people
under guardianship were able to vote.

34
00:02:14,171 --> 00:02:18,310
And also because of the undocumented
people that are around me and my family,

35
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:21,760
all the formerly incarcerated people
that are disproportionately affecting,

36
00:02:21,761 --> 00:02:24,460
you know, black people. I think
it's always important to vote,

37
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:25,750
not for myself but for them.

38
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:29,630
I come from Minnesota and I think
it's a very civically involved state.

39
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:32,670
I always saw it,
everybody you kind of voted.

40
00:02:32,671 --> 00:02:35,430
And when I was going into college,

41
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,980
I was a part of this campaign
called the vote no campaign,

42
00:02:37,981 --> 00:02:40,800
which was to turn down a
constitutional amendment,

43
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:45,180
which would have made it illegal for
gay people to get married and I am gay.

44
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:49,830
And so I got involved in that campaign
too to try to prevent it from happening.

45
00:02:49,831 --> 00:02:54,000
And we went from a very low approval rate,
um,

46
00:02:54,001 --> 00:02:58,210
same sex marriage in Minnesota too,
in just less than a year, um, uh,

47
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,340
very large approval rate.

48
00:03:00,341 --> 00:03:04,210
And we ended up to feeding
that constitutional amendment
and eventually became

49
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,750
one of the states that
legalized same sex marriage.

50
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,840
I'm part seminars as well.
And our ancestry is same thing,

51
00:03:13,841 --> 00:03:15,240
had been denied different.
Uh,

52
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,970
I hesitate to call them rights because
I don't think things that the government

53
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:22,630
gives you our rights. I'm like
privileges, you know? So I,

54
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,550
I don't really know if
I would call it that,

55
00:03:24,551 --> 00:03:27,520
but I definitely understand them denying
a certain privileges in the past and

56
00:03:27,521 --> 00:03:32,230
how now that we have those privileges,
sometimes we feel inclined to like, well,

57
00:03:32,231 --> 00:03:34,720
my ancestors didn't get to do this,
so I need to do this,

58
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:39,970
but I still hesitate to say that my vote
matters. Now there are some instances,

59
00:03:39,971 --> 00:03:40,571
like for example,

60
00:03:40,571 --> 00:03:43,870
you were talking about gay marriage and
I think maybe on a local level we could

61
00:03:43,871 --> 00:03:45,430
see the impact of our actions.

62
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:48,280
I think it's become increasingly clear
that whether you're talking about the

63
00:03:48,281 --> 00:03:51,940
electoral college or voting
machines being hacked or you know,

64
00:03:51,941 --> 00:03:53,980
we're not even getting into
philosophical side of things,

65
00:03:53,981 --> 00:03:57,400
that your vote really doesn't matter
that the end of the day there's a small

66
00:03:57,401 --> 00:03:59,110
group of people who decide what goes,
yeah,

67
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:03,760
I can understand your point, especially
with the history part. However,

68
00:04:03,761 --> 00:04:07,450
I also feel though that it's an informed
decision that I'm making and of course

69
00:04:07,451 --> 00:04:10,210
it's more impactful locally.
And because of that,

70
00:04:10,211 --> 00:04:13,810
because of my community and where I
live and all the changes that occur,

71
00:04:13,811 --> 00:04:15,550
it's important for me to,

72
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,760
to have that voice even if there's an
off chance that it may not really be

73
00:04:21,071 --> 00:04:25,210
effective. It's my right to use that voice
and I'm sure you can understand that.

74
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:30,240
I think my vote does matter to an extent
where it shows that I agree what's

75
00:04:30,821 --> 00:04:35,020
happening politically and since I do
disagree with what's going on politically

76
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:39,400
and I don't believe that this country has
a true democracy. That's where I think,

77
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:43,810
um, my vote doesn't matter
at that point. For me,

78
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:46,810
I'm more of a moderate,
but I do lean a little bit conservative.

79
00:04:46,811 --> 00:04:49,240
But as Finn from being in California,

80
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:52,990
you know the votes are going to be
towards more democratic votes. Personally,

81
00:04:52,991 --> 00:04:56,560
I don't think my vote wouldn't matter.
You know, when I'm voting for the primary,

82
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:00,520
the way I see it is that I vote every
single day. I vote with my actions.

83
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,010
I'm very involved in my community.
Well it drives me crazy.

84
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,920
I guess it's just that every two to four
years people all of a sudden pop up and

85
00:05:05,921 --> 00:05:09,130
act like they know what's going on around
the country just because the TV or the

86
00:05:09,131 --> 00:05:11,500
Internet is telling them, oh, it's
that time to pay attention again.

87
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,300
And so they get ready to,
you know,

88
00:05:13,301 --> 00:05:16,270
and then you get to the point where some
people are shaming those who choose not

89
00:05:16,271 --> 00:05:19,270
to participate, you know? So, uh, you
know, I just, I guess just for me,

90
00:05:19,271 --> 00:05:23,260
I want to encourage more people to vote
with their very being, not just like,

91
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:26,530
right on that list of a paper or press
that button and like, okay, that's it.

92
00:05:26,531 --> 00:05:28,510
I'll worry about it again in
two years, four years, whatever.

93
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:30,373
Okay.

94
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:32,523
Okay.

95
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,513
Yeah.

96
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:40,470
I mean, I'm proud to be
American. I really am.

97
00:05:40,471 --> 00:05:44,330
There's a lot of opportunities
that this country has given me. Um,

98
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,860
I don't necessarily agree what's
happening in the government.

99
00:05:46,861 --> 00:05:50,910
I don't necessarily agree
with the way of life here,

100
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:54,600
but I'm happy to be from here
and I'll always be proud of.

101
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,100
I had moved to Brazil to finish my
degree and when I was living there,

102
00:05:58,101 --> 00:06:01,310
I kind of had to make the decision whether
I wanted to move back to the United

103
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:01,940
States are not.

104
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:05,690
The reason why I was thinking about
staying in Brazil was why I wasn't happy

105
00:06:05,691 --> 00:06:08,900
with some of the things going on
in the United States, the politics,

106
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:10,220
the healthcare system,

107
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:13,190
all of these things were just
stacking up and I was thinking, God,

108
00:06:13,191 --> 00:06:15,740
that country is going to
shit. But I realized, well,

109
00:06:15,741 --> 00:06:19,250
I can either be a part of the solution
and making it better or I can just give

110
00:06:19,251 --> 00:06:20,084
up and run away.

111
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:23,300
But I chose to come back here and I've
been living here for five years now

112
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:29,440
though I am glad to be here in America.

113
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:31,960
When I think of patriotic,
I think of,

114
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,440
I believe in everything
that the country stands for.

115
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,200
You know how we operate and I'm just
going to be honest with you. I don't, um,

116
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,120
it's too many injustices
in today's society.

117
00:06:43,121 --> 00:06:46,120
I'm a bit embarrassed
to say I'm an American.

118
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,750
The whole lesser of two evils.

119
00:07:01,751 --> 00:07:05,980
That's exactly why does it have to be
to me both. Yeah, exactly. Why not?

120
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:10,510
Why can't evil. Yeah. Or why not
look to other parties, party systems.

121
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,450
I don't fall under any of that under my,
my religion,

122
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:18,810
not one politician has ever understood
what it's like to be a Muslim.

123
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:23,590
Nothing is being, nothing's being
pushed on my agenda and it won't be.

124
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:28,930
It will not be. Um, and I think the
whole system, the way it's set up,

125
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:29,861
it's just,

126
00:07:29,861 --> 00:07:34,720
it's always has an agenda first certain
type of people and it's always going to

127
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:39,070
be for that certain type of people.
It's a propaganda to get people,

128
00:07:39,071 --> 00:07:42,910
the masses of people to believe that we
have a voice and to believe that we have

129
00:07:42,911 --> 00:07:44,490
democracy when we really do.
Do you not,

130
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:49,040
I don't want to agree with the voice
part, but everything else. But you didn't,

131
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,280
you don't agree that they were the
right candidates? I don't know.

132
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:53,950
I don't have a voice side
where this country's going.

133
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:59,070
The way I understand it works though is
they got there somehow they got there

134
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,390
through, so we're kind of out. But they
did. They cheated their way there. I mean,

135
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:05,820
even when somebody like Bernie
Sanders tried to say, hey,

136
00:08:05,821 --> 00:08:08,100
we're gonna use all our grass roots
delegates and we're gonna challenge this

137
00:08:08,101 --> 00:08:10,650
system using their own rules
and they just change the rules.

138
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:12,810
I guess that's why I feel
like we should vote though.

139
00:08:12,811 --> 00:08:14,970
Especially right now for the primaries,
it's like,

140
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:17,570
I don't think we should give up.
It sounds like you guys,

141
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,700
no, not at all. Not at all. Not Giving up.

142
00:08:19,701 --> 00:08:24,580
It's just approaching it in a different
way to me. I was going to say though,

143
00:08:24,581 --> 00:08:25,720
as an activist,

144
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:29,830
aren't you trying to promote change
through your actions but through people's

145
00:08:29,831 --> 00:08:32,020
minds? Not to the political
system? Well, for me,

146
00:08:32,021 --> 00:08:35,620
I didn't vote for either two candidates.
I wanted one Jen,

147
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:39,510
John Casick to when the Republican
Party, but he didn't. Um,

148
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:42,190
and then also Gary Johnson
as an independent, uh,

149
00:08:42,191 --> 00:08:45,460
personally I didn't want
to vote independent because
just my community members

150
00:08:45,461 --> 00:08:49,210
seeing on social media don't
vote independent or are you
going to lead Trump win?

151
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:53,740
I can't please both sides cause it's so
far left or far right. And I'm just like,

152
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:55,770
what do I do? You know? And, um,

153
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,680
I think I got to the point where I
got frustrated where it's just like,

154
00:08:58,681 --> 00:09:00,040
you know what?
I'm just not going to vote.

155
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,980
I just feel that our current system is
not inclusive of everyone's thoughts and

156
00:09:14,981 --> 00:09:15,814
ideas.

157
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:19,520
Yeah. Like when we create a binary, um,

158
00:09:19,521 --> 00:09:21,620
we've forced people to choose
one thing or the other.

159
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:24,840
And that exists like in all
aspects of, um, you know,

160
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:27,770
being a person and participating
and you know, politics,

161
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,840
like there's so many
different types of people.

162
00:09:29,841 --> 00:09:32,540
There's so many like different types of,
you know,

163
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:35,150
thoughts that they have
that could be beneficial.

164
00:09:35,151 --> 00:09:37,640
And I think we should probably
start existing outside of that.

165
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:42,023
Shane.

166
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:52,580
Yeah. I think it's the bottom is us as
individual since a, we're considered,

167
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:57,110
you know, the bottom, the last resort
that, that voice that's, you know,

168
00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:00,980
small. I think that we're the bottom
and so we start with the change.

169
00:10:00,981 --> 00:10:04,340
Change starts with us when we look in
the mirror and how we see ourselves and

170
00:10:04,341 --> 00:10:07,130
how we see other people.
I believe that's where it starts.

171
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,040
Absolutely. You know, I
think that really the,

172
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,620
the smallest minority we talked
about a lot is from minorities,

173
00:10:11,621 --> 00:10:14,800
but the smallest minority that is
always under threat is the individual.

174
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,480
You know, those individuals can be
gay, can be black, if you're white,

175
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:17,921
can be Muslim,

176
00:10:17,921 --> 00:10:21,010
but it's the individual individual rights
pertaining to a number of different

177
00:10:21,011 --> 00:10:23,400
issues. At the end of the
day. I think that, you know,

178
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:27,610
Minnesota would got a lot sooner to gay
marriage and approval of that if the

179
00:10:27,611 --> 00:10:29,980
government just got the heck out of the
way and let free people do whatever they

180
00:10:29,981 --> 00:10:32,440
want and get married as
they please and you know,

181
00:10:32,441 --> 00:10:34,040
vote when they please and you know,

182
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,420
come just get the heck out of the way
and all sorts of arenas and let people

183
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:41,290
organize their affairs. You know, men,
women, whatever color, whatever religion.

184
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:44,310
I get that, but that's not an
option. I think like you're, you,

185
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,440
you're painting a fantasy on,
you see it as a fantasy. I mean,

186
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:50,410
I think the fantasy is using the system
to think that it's going to bend to our

187
00:10:50,411 --> 00:10:53,290
will. I mean that that wasn't
an option. That's not a choice.

188
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:56,140
It's like you could say the
same thing about women's rights,

189
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,340
African American rights
and I believe in it,

190
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:02,440
but people worked together to change that.
And that's what I'm saying.

191
00:11:02,441 --> 00:11:03,870
I think that's where the divide is,

192
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:08,140
is like right now I'm saying we should
work together to have a positive impact

193
00:11:08,141 --> 00:11:11,060
on the future. I'm with you. I just
won't follow you into the ballot.

194
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:12,410
Okay.

195
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:17,410
Consider the system that we are in today
and how you can make the change today.

196
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:22,640
Whether you feel that it is not impactful,

197
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:26,870
your vote for me matters.
Your vote locally matters.

198
00:11:26,871 --> 00:11:31,460
It'll change something in someone's
community. Um, so consider for me,

199
00:11:31,461 --> 00:11:35,060
I want you to consider the thought that
someone else somewhere else does not

200
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:40,061
have the same opportunity to go in and
be heard in the way that they choose.

201
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:41,590
Let me,

202
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:44,820
I'm always going to have a lot of
respect for people who decide not to vote

203
00:11:44,821 --> 00:11:47,190
because they don't
believe this system works.

204
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,380
I agree to that to a certain extent.

205
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,260
But I believe that local wording
is always the most important thing.

206
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:54,040
And like voting in community has always

207
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,410
been a part of forming that community.

208
00:11:57,150 --> 00:12:02,150
I think for now on it's just more like I
hope that there are people who won't be

209
00:12:02,941 --> 00:12:07,530
too far right to far left and that we
could all just kind of like chill out and

210
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:10,490
that I could like, you
know, just vote because it,

211
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:15,560
it's my opinion and my ideas and that I
hope that no one belittles me for that

212
00:12:15,721 --> 00:12:16,920
opinion that I might have.

213
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:21,000
It might not be popular or it might not
be trending on social media but that it

214
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:23,630
will be just accepted and
that I don't need it to sweat.

215
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:25,320
Like take one side or the other side.

216
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:26,421
At the end of the day.

217
00:12:26,421 --> 00:12:29,450
People can do whatever they want and
they can keep it private to themselves as

218
00:12:29,451 --> 00:12:33,260
well. And if you continue doing
the same things that you're doing,

219
00:12:33,261 --> 00:12:34,280
nothing's going to change.

220
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,023
All right.

221
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,390
I'm so sorry.

222
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:54,290
