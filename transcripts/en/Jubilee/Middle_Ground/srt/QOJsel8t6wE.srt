1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,460
You can say whatever.
Yeah.

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:04,130
Why am I nervous? I don't
know. I'm nervous right out.

3
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:06,183
Ooh,

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,510
my name is patty and I am pro life.

5
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:17,460
I had two abortions.

6
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:22,410
I know what happens to the emotional
and psychological part of women.

7
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:27,680
My name is John and I'm pro choice or the
six years of the planned parenthood of

8
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:28,520
golden gate.

9
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:33,050
My name is Marie and I am pro life and
I help him in reverse their abortion and

10
00:00:33,051 --> 00:00:35,300
once they've started them
if they would like to do so.

11
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:36,880
All right.

12
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,880
All [inaudible].

13
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:50,160
Hi Sports is the question.
Do you do this thing?

14
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:52,720
Is it tight?

15
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:59,760
No,
don't do it.

16
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,730
Well I'm the only one.
Oh well sandwiches.

17
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:08,000
Just something between two pieces
of bread and that's what hot dog is.

18
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:12,350
I disagree

19
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:18,560
and sandwiches, two
pieces of bread. Right.

20
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:23,570
But a hot dog bun isn't two pieces
of bread does its own thing.

21
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:27,140
And just the way it's Eaton was if
you had a hot dog bun and you put um,

22
00:01:27,141 --> 00:01:30,800
like Deli meats in there, would that
be still up? Would it be a sandwich?

23
00:01:30,801 --> 00:01:34,240
That would still be a hot dog though
still, right? I mean, it's like, oh, okay,

24
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,333
are we going to solve

25
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:45,670
next?
Sometimes I have a question around frozen.

26
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,043
Oh,
right.

27
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,180
Yeah. Because the other person's
perspective and you're like, okay,

28
00:01:56,181 --> 00:01:59,120
that makes sense. Yeah. No,

29
00:01:59,121 --> 00:02:04,121
I think I questioned mine often because
I could imagine that if I wasn't living

30
00:02:05,241 --> 00:02:07,930
my life based on my Christianity,
um,

31
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:10,760
I would want women to
have that choice as well.

32
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:22,580
I used to be a pro life feminist really,

33
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,380
until I had an abortion.

34
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:28,550
Actually I had two and after
I realized what I had done,

35
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,690
I knew I had made the biggest mistake
in my life. I realized that it was,

36
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,580
it wasn't my,

37
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:39,620
I shouldn't be taking the life of a child.

38
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,620
So after that,

39
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:46,160
I struggled with it for 35
years with my abortions.

40
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:49,370
And so I have no doubts.

41
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:52,330
I am all the way pro pro life.

42
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,550
But I believe fundamentally that the
woman should have that right to make the

43
00:02:56,551 --> 00:03:00,310
decision. And if I've never been
anybody, anybody's pro abortion,

44
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:05,140
and oftentimes they don't have good
choices and they're picking the lesser of

45
00:03:05,141 --> 00:03:06,730
the bad choices.

46
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:12,270
Yeah. I just feel like, uh, my, I'm
very certain of my views because,

47
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:17,550
uh, I want to respect that
everyone has that option. Um,

48
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,590
and I think that if you take that away,

49
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:24,180
you in danger children more than if
you allow them to make that choice for

50
00:03:24,181 --> 00:03:27,810
themselves. So, but she, uh,
we'll make and choose for herself,

51
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,840
but she doesn't have the right to choose
for someone else because if a child is

52
00:03:33,331 --> 00:03:37,200
inconvenient as a toddler, are you
going to kill that child as a toddler?

53
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,770
And then they were talking about a
completely different thing knowing that

54
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:40,351
science,

55
00:03:40,351 --> 00:03:43,440
we're talking science and I'm saying
like a lot of times women have to have

56
00:03:43,441 --> 00:03:48,190
abortions because of medical reasons.
That's like a lot of time time.

57
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:53,520
Oh,
you got us right in the thick of it.

58
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:56,803
Next,

59
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,310
I know of the,

60
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,750
my sister had an abortion.

61
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:11,090
Um,

62
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:14,720
almost two years ago I found out I was
pregnant and had an abortion forced on me

63
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:17,660
by a man twice my age
who made a ton of money.

64
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:21,740
And I felt like I had no other
choice if I wasn't a Christian.

65
00:04:21,741 --> 00:04:23,960
And if I didn't believe
the things that I believed,

66
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:28,970
I would be pro choice like
100% but at the end of the day,

67
00:04:28,971 --> 00:04:30,620
like to my core,

68
00:04:30,621 --> 00:04:35,621
I believe that all human life is
so sacred and it's not our choice.

69
00:04:36,711 --> 00:04:37,820
It's never been our choice.

70
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:43,170
I realize that I shouldn't have had that
choice because I was choosing life and

71
00:04:43,721 --> 00:04:48,040
death over another human being.
It's taking alive.

72
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,720
But I do understand, definitely
understand where you guys came from.

73
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,080
The only difference we have is when
the fetus becomes a human life.

74
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:02,500
If that's an and B, then my
tonsils in the movies, I think

75
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,180
it's a scary gray area. And in
the Bible you did say, you know,

76
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:08,730
I don't know what part of Christianity,
but Jesus says,

77
00:05:08,731 --> 00:05:10,380
before I formed you in your mother's womb,

78
00:05:10,381 --> 00:05:13,110
I knew you and not a sparrow falls
from the sky without my knowing.

79
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,980
I feel like I really respect
you and your faith. I respect,

80
00:05:16,981 --> 00:05:19,740
respect that that's your feeling
and that you all feel that way.

81
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:24,090
But I also feel like, um, one can
feel that way regardless of the Bible,

82
00:05:24,091 --> 00:05:27,450
regardless of Christianity. You
know, it's one of those things that

83
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:28,830
okay

84
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:32,340
happens and has happened
actually for decades, you know,

85
00:05:32,341 --> 00:05:37,341
for a while and people make that
decision and it is their decision.

86
00:05:38,461 --> 00:05:42,510
They make that decision for whatever
reasons. You know, I mean again, you,

87
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:45,780
you help people who have taken a pill
first then change their mind and I think

88
00:05:45,781 --> 00:05:49,920
that's great, but if you have one and
you feel regretful, then deal with it.

89
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:53,370
If you have, when you don't really feel
regretful or you feel like it really,

90
00:05:53,371 --> 00:05:55,530
truly was the best decision for you,
then that's what happens.

91
00:05:55,531 --> 00:05:58,520
And I just think we all know people that,
or I don't,

92
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:02,630
I just don't feel like we have any
right to, to force a particular way.

93
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:07,580
And you know, I think it's great to,
to try to just be open, you know?

94
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:09,323
Okay.

95
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,330
Pretty judge,
I believe.

96
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,220
Hey guys,
it's been a long time.

97
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:32,550
I think we all feel that way because,
because

98
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:37,170
it's an emotional,
a very emotional topic.

99
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:42,060
I've actually been verbally attacked
by a lot of the pro choice people.

100
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,730
You know about what I went
through with the regret,

101
00:06:44,731 --> 00:06:48,270
the alcoholism and all of that
stuff that tied into the abortion

102
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,021
for me.

103
00:06:49,021 --> 00:06:53,820
It's something that Maria said a little
bit while ago about her Christian faith

104
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:56,910
and implicit in that, is it someone
whose approach choices and Christian,

105
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:00,840
I was raised a Roman Catholic.
I consider myself a Christian.

106
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:05,630
I don't believe that there's anything
in Christianity as I understand it,

107
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:09,390
that requires me to believe
that abortion is murder.

108
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:13,010
I grew up in a Christian home.
My mom's a pastor,

109
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:18,040
but they also respect that they know
that it's my ultimate decision and they

110
00:07:18,321 --> 00:07:21,890
know that what it is I'm going to do well,
I'm going to choose for my life.

111
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:26,690
They don't have control over and that
I am an adult sometimes in the argument

112
00:07:26,691 --> 00:07:31,010
between the two sides. There's a lack
of respect for the fact that like,

113
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,810
I don't have to agree with you.

114
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,410
You live your life the way that you want
to and I'll leave it the way I want you

115
00:07:36,411 --> 00:07:40,400
as long as you're not stopping.
Sorry you guys.

116
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:54,280
I have two kids. One a son who's 30. Uh,

117
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:56,120
and then a daughter who is 28.

118
00:07:56,730 --> 00:08:00,420
I have one son who is 36.
He's adopted.

119
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,030
I couldn't have children biologically.

120
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:06,900
I convinced the doctor to give me a
Tubal ligation because I didn't feel I

121
00:08:06,901 --> 00:08:08,910
punished myself for having the abortions.

122
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:10,880
Okay.

123
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,790
I have a daughter,
she's a year old and she's in heaven.

124
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,810
To me, it, my experience at planned
parenthood was everybody got to kids.

125
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:28,450
And the, the slogan, if you will,

126
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:32,970
of planned parenthood was no
child, unwanted child, not pad.

127
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,460
We wanted our children and
that's why we chose to have them.

128
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,720
What about all the people that would
gladly take care of that child that cannot

129
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,510
have a pregnancy to save their life?

130
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:44,020
Well, because the woman
has to, it has to go

131
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:47,000
nine months for a whole life
that a child could have.

132
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:56,400
Um, I think one of the things that
I immediately reacted is that,

133
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:01,710
okay, nine months, whatever.
But there are so many children,

134
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:06,740
not just in America but the world over
that don't have loving parents that are

135
00:09:06,901 --> 00:09:10,650
not in a loving situation, that
are not cared for, fed, clothed,

136
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:12,990
loved.
And I,

137
00:09:12,991 --> 00:09:16,740
and I think that is the most important
thing to care about our children because

138
00:09:16,741 --> 00:09:20,700
they are our future. So the child in
the womb has no value whatsoever. No,

139
00:09:20,701 --> 00:09:23,780
I don't think so at all. I'm not saying
that I never said, I'm just asking,

140
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,790
just saying that to me that's
unclear whether it's you know,

141
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,410
this or that or this or that.

142
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:32,670
And despite the fact that you say there
are people out there that want to adopt

143
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:34,560
this child or want to
take care of this child,

144
00:09:34,561 --> 00:09:38,400
there are still so many that are not.
And that's, I don't think that wrong.

145
00:09:38,401 --> 00:09:41,580
Makes this right though.
I understand that. I'm not
saying that I'm only, I'm only,

146
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,420
I'm only responding to your comments
about my, my view is I don't,

147
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,550
I don't personally want to have kids.

148
00:09:47,551 --> 00:09:50,460
I want to adopt all my children
because of that reason.

149
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:55,520
And because I live with a family that
took me in when my family didn't want me.

150
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:59,420
And so I understand that one,

151
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:02,400
the foster system and
adoption is not that easy.

152
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:06,210
And if we're making it about taking
care of the child, yeah, let's do that.

153
00:10:06,211 --> 00:10:07,260
Let's take care of the children.

154
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:10,170
But we need to make sure that there
are opportunities in place for all the

155
00:10:10,171 --> 00:10:13,680
children to be successful so that that
child has a world that co to come into

156
00:10:13,681 --> 00:10:13,890
you.

157
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:16,830
It's actually going to be good to it
because we don't live in that world right

158
00:10:16,831 --> 00:10:19,170
now. We don't offer those
things to our children.

159
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,930
We should talk a lot of the people
that came from a ton of adversity,

160
00:10:21,931 --> 00:10:24,960
you've now made it in this world
who live talking about that.

161
00:10:24,961 --> 00:10:28,040
We're not talking about the success
cannot be about people that I am a kid,

162
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:32,460
so to day they do not. And they're
worth that worth, in my opinion,

163
00:10:32,461 --> 00:10:37,170
is exactly equal to a 20 week baby and
totally understand and I respect that.

164
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:41,550
I'm only saying, my only comment was
I feel like it's unfair to be like,

165
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,740
well, blah, blah blah in nine months.

166
00:10:43,741 --> 00:10:47,690
Why can't you just have a kid for nine
months? And they give it up. Oh, cool.

167
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:54,380
It is getting cooler in here though,
isn't it?

168
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:00,390
Yeah.

169
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,133
Um,

170
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:23,260
I wasn't expecting to hear some of the
stories about people's lives and their

171
00:11:23,261 --> 00:11:26,800
experiences, um, who've had abortions.

172
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,260
And like I can only,

173
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:34,290
I can only imagine the pain that is
associated to making that decision.

174
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,580
And I have a lot of compassion and
sympathy for people who go through that.

175
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:43,090
Um,
I wasn't expecting,

176
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:48,000
I wasn't expecting it to
be as calm as it was. Um,

177
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,360
I think that there were moments,

178
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:54,220
but I think for the most part we
were respectful each other. And,

179
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,640
um, I still think that you
guys are awesome people.

180
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,770
I the outside of this situation,

181
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:07,300
okay.

182
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:12,160
I wasn't surprised at how this has
gone because when we were all talking

183
00:12:12,161 --> 00:12:12,994
outside,

184
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:17,170
it didn't make any difference who's
side was on whose side and we,

185
00:12:17,171 --> 00:12:19,420
and we all bonded right away.
You know,

186
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:22,210
sometime you are levels got a
little bit raised, but you know,

187
00:12:22,211 --> 00:12:23,830
why were we all respect each other?

188
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:26,600
No matter what you do, you've,
you've heard all the arguments.

189
00:12:26,601 --> 00:12:30,050
There's not going to be one argument
where you're like, oh my gosh,

190
00:12:30,051 --> 00:12:32,750
I just changed my mind. No,
it's never going to, you know,

191
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:37,190
people are who they are and it usually
takes a certain situation happening,

192
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:40,670
but I think it's healthy to
have the dialogue. I think
it doesn't happen enough.

193
00:12:40,671 --> 00:12:42,380
It happens too much behind our computers.

194
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,490
Oh, okay. Cool.

195
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:48,300
Sorry,
dogs.

196
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:56,300
It was great to me.

197
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:02,360
Yeah.
