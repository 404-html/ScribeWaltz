1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,130
Men are making choices for us,
women about birth control,

2
00:00:05,131 --> 00:00:08,100
abortion, healthcare, everything. And we,

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,670
we can't even have a say
on it cause he won't even,

4
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:25,950
I have my non feminists in the left
spotlights that my feminist in the right

5
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,593
spotlight,

6
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:38,280
the feminist movement has changed
from its original definition.

7
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,113
Yeah.

8
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:49,993
Okay.

9
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:57,560
The reason why I hesitated is because
I started to think about who is most

10
00:00:57,561 --> 00:00:59,660
served by mainstream feminism.

11
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,490
I don't personally think that that
has changed. I think that white,

12
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,200
heterosexual,

13
00:01:06,201 --> 00:01:10,430
cisgendered women are most
served by mainstream feminism.

14
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:13,490
When I heard the definition of feminist
rate, I was like, yeah, I'm a feminist.

15
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,610
Like yeah, you know, I believe in
equality of the sexes. Of course they do.

16
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:21,020
But it changed.
The more that I researched the movement,

17
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,470
the more that I saw how
mainstream media portrayed it.

18
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:28,280
And to me it's like there's a lot
of issues with that happen to men in

19
00:01:28,281 --> 00:01:31,870
disproportionate amounts that are
always overlooked that you know,

20
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,920
no one talks about the suicide rate.

21
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:37,490
No one talks about the
homelessness rate for men.

22
00:01:37,491 --> 00:01:40,550
And it sucks because if you're whole
movement is based around equality of the

23
00:01:40,551 --> 00:01:44,900
sexes, right. And to make sure both sexes
are equal, then that covers the whole,

24
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:49,790
the whole spectrum, right? It's
not just one sex, it's equality.

25
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:54,950
The title of feminist
inherently excludes men.

26
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:58,170
Interesting.
But the definition doesn't it?

27
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,660
Male privilege is real.

28
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,720
It's not lost on me.

29
00:02:15,721 --> 00:02:20,721
How many more men are in academia and
in higher education are women are called

30
00:02:21,931 --> 00:02:24,840
more often to put their careers on hold,
um,

31
00:02:24,841 --> 00:02:27,960
in order to have children or
for whatever other reasons.

32
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:32,310
That's just kind of the way I see it
manifesting most in my life is just seeing

33
00:02:32,311 --> 00:02:36,000
how hard it is to be an intellectual
woman. Um, and academia.

34
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,210
My name is faith and I am not a feminist.

35
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:42,390
I am a strong woman and I
was raised by strong women,

36
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,720
but I cannot get behind a few of the core
ideals of what it often means to be a

37
00:02:48,061 --> 00:02:50,670
feminist.
So I do not identify as one.

38
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:53,660
My mother is a teacher.
She has her master's.

39
00:02:53,661 --> 00:02:58,661
She's as years and years of experience
and yet her place within the school,

40
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,840
her place within,
um,

41
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:06,340
as far as like authority over
students is not the same as a man.

42
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,580
And I think that's an inequality that,
um,

43
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,760
I've just been shown from my
mother who comes home and says,

44
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:15,011
you know,

45
00:03:15,011 --> 00:03:17,440
I just had the worst day of work because
I was uncomfortable the entire time.

46
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:23,010
Or I had a strange experience with a male
student who just like would not listen

47
00:03:23,741 --> 00:03:26,220
to a word I said.
It wasn't connecting.

48
00:03:26,221 --> 00:03:30,010
And it wasn't until I brought in the
vice principal who was male or another

49
00:03:30,011 --> 00:03:33,490
teacher who was mental. That things
can be kind of squashed and covered.

50
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:39,653
Yeah.

51
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:41,531
Just growing up,

52
00:03:41,531 --> 00:03:45,070
I would say that overall or our school
systems are more geared towards women.

53
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:48,840
There's more female teachers, and that's
how our children aren't raised. You know,

54
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:50,470
the,
the thing is that you were alluding to,

55
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,280
your mom has to deal with
those difficulties that a
man would not have to deal

56
00:03:54,281 --> 00:03:54,920
with.

57
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:58,150
Men have to deal with a
lot of difficulties that
most women wouldn't have to

58
00:03:58,151 --> 00:04:01,420
deal with and we do benefit from
certain privileges. But so to women,

59
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:04,510
I think you considered it
a privilege that women,

60
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,280
there are more women in
the teaching profession,

61
00:04:06,281 --> 00:04:10,540
but you should also consider that
other options weren't necessarily or

62
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:14,950
historically available to women
because they were considered to be more

63
00:04:14,951 --> 00:04:18,130
nurturing. A lot of women
were pushed into that field.

64
00:04:18,131 --> 00:04:22,180
Still women are choosing these majors
and choosing their region of study,

65
00:04:22,181 --> 00:04:25,270
whereas men are tending to
choose higher paying majors.

66
00:04:25,271 --> 00:04:30,271
They're choosing more to go into stem
fields and such like that and reaping the

67
00:04:31,091 --> 00:04:35,500
financial benefits while women are also
reaping their own happiness benefits of

68
00:04:35,501 --> 00:04:37,120
going into a field that they enjoy.

69
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:42,150
If I were born the opposite sex,
my life would be easier.

70
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:57,820
I started to walk over just thinking
inherently the privileges that men in the

71
00:04:59,221 --> 00:05:03,320
society have and how they're
able to navigate far easier and,

72
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,640
and all of that stuff.

73
00:05:04,641 --> 00:05:09,320
And then I thought what it would be
like to be a black man in this society.

74
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,820
And, um, I don't know that
it would be any easier.

75
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,680
I am first generation Mexican American.
I have cheap Mexican parents.

76
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,360
Um,
if I were to be born a male Mexican,

77
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:26,750
it'd be so much easier
for just that group.

78
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,470
I tried to break off from
those stereotypes of Melanie,

79
00:05:30,471 --> 00:05:32,600
get the table ready for
dinner. Uh, excuse me.

80
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:35,780
I have two brothers that can do
the exact same thing. You know,

81
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:37,580
why can't they do it?
Why do I have to do it?

82
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:41,630
My name is Melanie Valdez and
I am on the feminist side.

83
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:46,730
I had an incident where I was sexually
assaulted and that changed my whole

84
00:05:46,731 --> 00:05:47,564
perspective.

85
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,010
If I was born,
any other thing than I

86
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:58,730
am,

87
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:02,510
I would have to struggle differently than
I have already struggled and you know,

88
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:05,240
compare it to some people and you know,

89
00:06:05,241 --> 00:06:08,210
minorities or some people that are white,

90
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,980
some people that are white
of struggle more than me.

91
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,620
There's always a positive and a
negative that you're born with.

92
00:06:12,621 --> 00:06:16,070
And it's how you utilize
that and get over it.

93
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:21,130
That I think is important rather than
focusing on if I was born this or if I was

94
00:06:21,711 --> 00:06:22,544
born.
That

95
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:26,470
I think it is kind of what we make of
it and I'd almost say that to to want to

96
00:06:26,471 --> 00:06:30,790
be anything different than what we are
is possibly even defeating the purpose of

97
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:32,050
the feminist movement.

98
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:37,500
A big part of feminism is telling
women that they're worth it already.

99
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:42,850
That there are already enough.
I have a little sister,

100
00:06:42,851 --> 00:06:46,300
I have friends who were told by their,
by their father,

101
00:06:46,301 --> 00:06:50,170
by their older brother that you are
enough and other don't whenever they want

102
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,720
because they were told they could.

103
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:56,080
They weren't given the opportunity from
the beginning and they weren't told,

104
00:06:56,081 --> 00:06:57,610
well if you are a man you
could no, no, no, no, no.

105
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:01,210
They were told you are a woman and
you can because of who you are.

106
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:07,090
Not sure that having a community
that affirms who you are is enough.

107
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:12,600
If the society and the structure and the
laws and the policies that govern tell

108
00:07:13,871 --> 00:07:17,710
you otherwise. My parents told me
I could do whatever I want to do.

109
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:21,100
And so I went to law school and
I'm an attorney and I write,

110
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,950
but I don't make as much as my,

111
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:27,760
my coworker who does the exact same thing
and who I'm probably a more qualified

112
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:28,240
then

113
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,070
from the statistics that I read, there was
no wage gap. Those in earnings. Yes. Yes.

114
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:36,610
Generally it's your understanding that
there is no wage gap between men and

115
00:07:36,611 --> 00:07:37,860
women. Yes. There's that. Yeah.

116
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:43,020
Different positions, uh, different, uh,
different schooling can also be a factor.

117
00:07:43,021 --> 00:07:45,270
You can have the same degree but from
two different schools and they'll pay

118
00:07:45,271 --> 00:07:48,690
someone from the better school.
Different, uh, how the interviews go.

119
00:07:48,691 --> 00:07:51,600
Even negotiable, you know, entry salaries.

120
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:56,800
Why then are women choosing
jobs that pay less a culture?

121
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:04,890
Men and women need to work
together to create equality.

122
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:23,120
I think one of the reasons that I can
take issue with certain types of feminism

123
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:26,750
is it does come across as anti man.

124
00:08:26,751 --> 00:08:29,990
Sometimes it comes across as
it's your fault. You know,

125
00:08:29,991 --> 00:08:33,710
if I go to the women's March and I see
signs that say smash the Patriarchy and

126
00:08:33,711 --> 00:08:36,920
like our p word bites
back and stuff like that,

127
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:42,400
that's as much as that speaking against
an oppressive top culture that's

128
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:46,070
speaking to all men.
And I don't see that as helpful.

129
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:50,790
Well, I think all men benefit
from patriarchy. I mean,

130
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:53,100
you need to acknowledge
your privilege first.

131
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:56,190
If people could hear that about themselves

132
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,620
and not be defensive,

133
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:03,480
I think that we could probably push
the needle forward a lot faster.

134
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:04,230
Um,

135
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:08,940
something that plagues the feminist
movement is that there's this idea that in

136
00:09:08,941 --> 00:09:11,610
order to, um, gain equal footing,

137
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:16,480
the other side has to be
emasculated or has to be, um,

138
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:19,770
dropped down and it's not, this
is empire. You know what I mean?

139
00:09:19,771 --> 00:09:23,930
Just cause I get a slice doesn't mean
you get, you get, you get less, right.

140
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,320
Yeah.

141
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:30,150
Advocating for women's rights doesn't
infringe upon men's rights. Right.

142
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,000
You know,

143
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
first and second wave feminism were very
clear in the very particular thing is

144
00:09:36,071 --> 00:09:38,320
that they were trying to accomplish.
You had first wave feminism,

145
00:09:38,321 --> 00:09:41,470
which was very clearly, you're
trying to get the right to vote. Um,

146
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:44,620
second wave feminism right after,
like World War II and such,

147
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:47,710
helping women progressing
in the workplace and such.

148
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:52,740
And now I see third wave feminism and it
is a broken apart can be lost movement

149
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:58,150
that goes in so many directions, has so
many extra qualifiers. And I think about,

150
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:58,630
um,

151
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:02,590
I was talking to one of my friends who
went to the women's march with a pro life

152
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:05,290
feminist group and she
said on multiple accounts,

153
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:09,160
they were asked to leave because that's
not why the women's march was happening

154
00:10:09,161 --> 00:10:10,840
and did they were,
they were against the movement.

155
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,900
And so you have all these
different types of, of feminism.

156
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:16,690
There doesn't seem to be a
clear center and a clear desire.

157
00:10:16,691 --> 00:10:20,140
And I hear people call themselves
feminists for all different reasons.

158
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:23,680
And with some of them I would agree and
I would call myself a feminist for those

159
00:10:23,681 --> 00:10:26,140
reasons.
But because it's so all over the place,

160
00:10:26,141 --> 00:10:28,000
I just can't call myself a feminist.

161
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,980
If feminists can make a concise,
uh,

162
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:34,470
push towards one issue together,

163
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:39,500
what I would I be willing to join if I
agreed with the point? Yes. Okay. If I,

164
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:43,320
if I agreed with what the
movement was going for, yes, yes.

165
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:48,490
If it's just not sure that I'm concerned
whether or not you want to join as it

166
00:10:48,741 --> 00:10:53,540
would end, it was about not part of the
issue, but that's segregating Jen. That's,

167
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,840
that's segregating genders.

168
00:10:54,841 --> 00:10:57,930
If you're saying that you don't care about
my opinion as a man that goes against

169
00:10:57,931 --> 00:10:58,381
everything.

170
00:10:58,381 --> 00:11:03,381
The photos here reshaping and forming
my feminism in a way that is digestible

171
00:11:06,571 --> 00:11:10,410
for you as a man.
So what's the current one message?

172
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:13,680
The definition of feminism
across the board is the social,

173
00:11:13,681 --> 00:11:16,650
political and economic
equality of the sexes. Yes.

174
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:19,350
Why are we only talking about
the female inequalities?

175
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:21,050
Why aren't we talking about the mail?
And you call,

176
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,790
you do not have the same experience.
We do not.

177
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,850
You are not oppressed in
the same ways that I am. No.

178
00:11:26,851 --> 00:11:28,920
And I'm sure you're not oppressed
in the same ways that I am.

179
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,990
More of our world leaders should be women.

180
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:49,020
Let's talk about um, for
like this like abortion. Um,

181
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:53,830
those who signed the bill in the room
with Trump, they were all white men.

182
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:58,240
I did not see a single woman.

183
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:01,810
Does it matter if it's a white woman?
I did not take a single woman in there.

184
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:04,060
So those

185
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:10,660
men are making choices for us.
Women about birth control,

186
00:12:10,661 --> 00:12:13,480
abortion, healthcare, everything. And we,

187
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,880
we can't even have a say on it
cause they won't even hear us.

188
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:21,100
I don't view it as we should
have more women in office.

189
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:25,090
I view it as we should have the
most qualified people in office.

190
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:29,500
If you have an issue with, you know,
the bill being signed by white men,

191
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,150
I believe that voting for Congress,
people that are women or you know,

192
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:37,330
whoever you review and believe
are the most qualified,

193
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:41,860
we'll put those people in power.
If we are talking about the last election,

194
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:46,270
I believe that the most
qualified candidate did not win.

195
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:51,160
People need to really consider
what role gender played in that.

196
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:55,130
Just logically the people that they're
representing are both men and women.

197
00:12:55,131 --> 00:12:57,830
So the people representing
us should be men and women.

198
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:02,900
And we'd be really hard for me to ever
understand why people wouldn't think that

199
00:13:02,901 --> 00:13:06,980
there should be more women in leadership.
I love women.

200
00:13:06,981 --> 00:13:11,030
I love being a woman. I love strong
women. I was raised by strong women.

201
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:15,880
I don't agree with all of the
things that are traditionally, um,

202
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,080
included in feminist beliefs.

203
00:13:18,081 --> 00:13:22,130
Like I have a different view
on abortion then you guys.

204
00:13:22,131 --> 00:13:26,610
So that's a big deal for me. That's one
of the most important things to me. Um,

205
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:31,340
I'm a Christian and that's just one of
my beliefs. So that's kind of for me,

206
00:13:31,341 --> 00:13:34,580
that's one of the driving forces.
Why I don't identify as a feminist

207
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:38,590
to divided into two teams gender wise is,
is not spartan.

208
00:13:38,591 --> 00:13:40,840
It's not often what we do,
but it is sometimes.

209
00:13:40,841 --> 00:13:43,600
And how do we avoid that and
how do we avoid that separation?

210
00:13:43,601 --> 00:13:45,820
How do we make it a collective effort?

211
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:49,030
Even though I'm a conservative
white man and you know,

212
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:53,380
there are different views than me and I
don't want to force you to agree with me.

213
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:56,020
Um, I don't want to change
your mind in that way,

214
00:13:56,021 --> 00:14:00,730
but I want to see how I can still work
with you fully and be on your team and

215
00:14:00,731 --> 00:14:04,240
you can be on mine as we disagree.
Agreeably

216
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:11,950
thank you everyone for probably the
most respectful middle ground I've ever
