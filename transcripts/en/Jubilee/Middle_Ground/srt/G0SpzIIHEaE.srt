1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,240
Those are things we don't want in the
United States. And one other thing,

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:05,270
predatory behavior,

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:11,070
I got mad at me, but if I could say
this, it's not baked into their religion.

4
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:24,620
Trump's support supporters. Can I
have you over there? My immigrants?

5
00:00:24,621 --> 00:00:25,760
Can I have you in the other leg?

6
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:28,503
Yeah.

7
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,330
Sometimes I feel anxious about
how the other side views me.

8
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:40,023
Hmm.

9
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:49,400
Uh, so it's not necessarily
about the idea of immigrants,

10
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:54,490
but I'm Muslim and there can be a
lot of directed aggression from Trump

11
00:00:54,561 --> 00:00:58,790
supporters that I think I felt and other
people in my Muslim community have felt.

12
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,000
And that's why I'm here
sitting with you guys.

13
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:05,190
I own a clothing line, maggot
[inaudible]. This is my clothing line.

14
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:10,230
I'm a political strategist and a political
activist. And when I leave my house,

15
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,330
I am in fear for my life because
every day I get death threats.

16
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:19,620
So I think we both should be
able to freely express ourselves.

17
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:24,270
I love everybody. I'm here for everybody.
I'll fight for your right, for freedom.

18
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,900
But I expect for you to fight for mine
too, because that's why we're in America.

19
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:32,180
My name is [inaudible].
So I absolutely love immigration,

20
00:01:32,181 --> 00:01:34,550
but I believe that we
need to secure our border.

21
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,450
And it's the same thing of I wouldn't
just let anyone in my car or in my house,

22
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,450
alright,
disagree has come on in.

23
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,880
I used to get anxious
about how I'm perceived,

24
00:01:45,881 --> 00:01:48,100
not just by some quote unquote other side,

25
00:01:48,101 --> 00:01:51,610
because my identity is very
apparent in standing in my truth.

26
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:56,500
I think it allows other folks to stand
in there as and to invite people to also

27
00:01:56,501 --> 00:02:00,700
learn more about me rather than be
worried about how I'm perceived.

28
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:05,300
I think my group gets represented
unfairly in the media.

29
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,533
Yeah,

30
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:17,060
well I'm a Mexican and I hesitated
because when Trump said the things about

31
00:02:17,061 --> 00:02:20,360
Mexicans been criminals and all that,
I,

32
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:24,470
I didn't took it personal because
I'm not that. So I was like,

33
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,770
that does not represent me.
Like don't take things personally.

34
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,760
So that's why I hesitated.
But then I'm like,

35
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:33,080
I am not only one Mexican
individual was an immigrant.

36
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,410
I'm part of all the immigrants no
matter what country you're from.

37
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:40,130
Or we can say the same thing for Trump
supporters. Right? I mean, now we have to,

38
00:02:40,131 --> 00:02:43,460
maybe I wasn't called a racist, but you
are called racist. Well, guess what?

39
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:47,150
We're both Trump supporters.
So now we have to band together.

40
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:50,820
Could I, could I ask both of
you a question and I'd like it.

41
00:02:50,821 --> 00:02:53,840
An honest reaction to this
in my mind is languaging.

42
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:58,770
I'm a writer and I think if we made a
distinction between jihadists and Muslims

43
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,130
that would solve

44
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:02,380
a big problem that's possible.

45
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:06,100
And I think a lot of that goes into
really the realm of how much people really

46
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:10,560
are interested and understanding
that kind of diversification and uh,

47
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,380
allowing the community that does
no, that really, um, I don't know,

48
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:17,950
take the lead and a initiative and
show other people what that's about.

49
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:20,680
I feel threatened by this presidency.

50
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:23,900
Oh,
that's interesting.

51
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:31,620
When president Trump got
elected as president,

52
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:36,980
I was scared even though I had not
a reason to because I'm legal here,

53
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:40,110
power becomes scary in hands of a monster.

54
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:45,590
Power becomes scary and hence of
ignorance and I'm scared about my people.

55
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,430
And not only, like I said,
the Mexicans, all the good
hardworking immigrants. Right.

56
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,230
Yeah. I think, um,

57
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:57,160
the election night was
when I felt alarmed.

58
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:01,810
I've been a community organizer and
an activist for 15 years now, right?

59
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,580
That night it felt like a slap in the
face to all of the work that we have

60
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:09,160
always tried to do in terms
of humanizing ourselves.

61
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,770
My name is Kyla shot.

62
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:14,970
I think we realize as immigrants how
lucky we are to be here and that's why we

63
00:04:14,971 --> 00:04:18,420
want to create a society that's more
welcoming for others to be here.

64
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,390
You said it was a slap in the face,

65
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:26,810
and I take offense to that because you
were saying you worked so hard and yet we

66
00:04:28,591 --> 00:04:29,520
worked so hard to,

67
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:35,030
to elect a president of the United States
that we think will enforce the laws,

68
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:40,760
will enforce the United
States constitution and it
wasn't to be racist or it

69
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:46,041
wasn't to boot you out of the country and
it was to enforce the first amendment.

70
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,530
It's actually to enforce
your freedom of speech.

71
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:54,330
I understand why you're scared
that as a white Trump supporter,

72
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,070
I am scared of this presidency because
I have lost my freedom of speech.

73
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,470
I have lost my freedom of religion.

74
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:05,880
I have lost my freedom to wear this
shirt in the public just because I have a

75
00:05:05,881 --> 00:05:08,910
different political view.
Now.

76
00:05:08,911 --> 00:05:11,280
I'm the enemy in my own country.

77
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:13,580
I think that that's unfortunate
about happened to you,

78
00:05:13,581 --> 00:05:17,390
but it's almost like you
have some semblance of the
reality that people of color

79
00:05:17,391 --> 00:05:19,160
live with for centuries here,

80
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:22,850
but I've never seen that and I've never
the first time you felt that. Right,

81
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:24,470
right. But I, I'm just going to let you,

82
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,710
no, that my neighbors are are black.
I have Muslim neighbors. I have,

83
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,440
I have neighbors of all kinds.

84
00:05:29,441 --> 00:05:31,540
When we go to the grocery store
and I'm Picking Out Yogurt,

85
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,260
I'm picking out yogurt.
It looks like someone just like you,

86
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:36,980
but it doesn't mean that you
experienced the same thing as me,

87
00:05:36,981 --> 00:05:39,440
even though we eat the same yogurt,
but nobody

88
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:43,090
in my county treats people
like that. It's just not. Thank

89
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:43,250
you.

90
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:46,970
Would be able to say that I lived in
Orange County up until a few months ago.

91
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:50,150
If I'm at a mall or if I'm
even at the beach. Right.

92
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,370
I get a lot of strange stares.

93
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:57,430
I even feel like a lot of people after
the election came up to me asking me

94
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:01,190
about my positions, my
religion, my identity.

95
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:05,030
So what I'm trying to say is like I can
actually relate to what you went through

96
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:10,031
because that to be honest is a shred of
similarity to what people of color have

97
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,330
always came here

98
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:16,320
when we were born basically.
Sure. I believe in immigration,

99
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,550
but I am against illegal immigration.

100
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,453
Yeah.

101
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,800
My whole thing is a assimilation,
right?

102
00:06:26,801 --> 00:06:29,350
So like making sure
that the cultures match.

103
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:33,640
If you know someone in the Middle
East who's gay will be killed. Right.

104
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,490
That's the thing. And it's
horrible. If someone would,

105
00:06:36,491 --> 00:06:41,200
that culture is somehow makes it through
vetting and comes here and then sees a

106
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:43,690
gay couple, you know, kissing or whatever,

107
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,570
they're going to freak out or they're
going to react very differently in a way

108
00:06:46,571 --> 00:06:50,050
that, you know, we're trying to move past
or we're not trying to be held back by.

109
00:06:50,051 --> 00:06:55,051
So I believe assimilation is probably
one of the most important factors of why

110
00:06:55,271 --> 00:06:57,790
we need legal, not illegal,
immigrations. Okay.

111
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:02,210
My thing is about money or an awful lot
of people who came here legally don't

112
00:07:02,211 --> 00:07:06,470
want illegal people being able
to come or get free college.

113
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:11,690
It costs $118 billion in welfare benefits.
That's a huge,

114
00:07:11,691 --> 00:07:16,490
why do I have to pay so that
Walmart has cheap workers.

115
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:20,210
My name's Ken Unger. I don't have
anything against him. I crunch.

116
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,330
It's a political problem.
It's not an immigrant problem.

117
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:29,200
I was an illegal immigrant. I at one
point in my life, I am not anymore.

118
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,810
But ultimately we left the country of war,

119
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,560
a country where extremism
and terrorism was a reality.

120
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:39,400
And this is something that was on
a daily oppression towards women.

121
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:40,130
Um,

122
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:45,050
and if we don't have legal
immigration and we'll have that here,

123
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:49,880
we want you to come and be safe.
But don't you want that for everyone else?

124
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:52,140
Does it matter where you're coming from?
Okay.

125
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,940
I think it might be a misconstrued and,

126
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:59,050
or a misconception to think
that the illegal immigrants
might bring up the crime

127
00:08:00,471 --> 00:08:03,130
rates. And when we're talking
about, uh, what happens, uh,

128
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:07,730
after immigrants or refugees or illegals
and anything come into the state and

129
00:08:07,731 --> 00:08:10,940
how can we help them from here? I think
that is the real essential question.

130
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,700
We have a humanitarian duty to help one
another out regardless of f where I've

131
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:19,660
gotten a four, it's fairly,
if we're American, we're all
humans ultimately. Right?

132
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:23,410
So, fantastic. What about our backs? What
about our children that are starving?

133
00:08:23,411 --> 00:08:27,190
What about our foster homes that are full?
What about them?

134
00:08:27,191 --> 00:08:29,830
We're not helping them.
Where we're taking in all these refugees.

135
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:34,330
If we can't fix our citizens,
how can we fix others?

136
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,540
It's just kind of like, if I can't love
myself, I can't love another person.

137
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:41,670
It should be easier to
immigrate into America.

138
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:43,203
Hmm.

139
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,550
It should be easier. The wait
time should be shorter. Right?

140
00:08:52,551 --> 00:08:55,470
But I believe that it's so lengthy.

141
00:08:55,471 --> 00:08:59,220
Not because the process is so extreme.
I mean,

142
00:08:59,221 --> 00:09:02,130
personally I think it's so
lengthy because it's mismanaged.

143
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:05,280
I think that like the cookie jar,
well that too,

144
00:09:05,281 --> 00:09:09,090
but I think it's just like there's a
way in a process that should be put in

145
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:13,410
place. So it's not 15 years, let's
say that they fully cooperate. Right?

146
00:09:13,411 --> 00:09:16,560
Let's say they have everything. They have
all their documents and they're ready.

147
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:17,680
Yeah.
I think it should be

148
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:22,260
be a lot shorter. You can make it less
bureaucratic. Yeah, basically. Okay.

149
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:24,880
I mean,
I think I would agree with that.

150
00:09:24,881 --> 00:09:29,440
I just feel like when it comes to Trump,
you support the individual,

151
00:09:29,441 --> 00:09:33,870
but then the bureaucracy,
the administration, all
of that is so painstaking,

152
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:38,480
just so inefficient. And in all of
this, it doesn't really compute for me.

153
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:41,510
I think I'm only been in
there a year. Right? Yeah.

154
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:44,740
And we have so many changes that we
want to make. So let's talk about

155
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:48,020
well, of policy things. What about
the Muslim man or the travel ban?

156
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:51,550
The travel ban to me was more of a,
well, it was something that was correct,

157
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:55,220
but it was enacted by Trump.
Don't, don't get me wrong.

158
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:59,060
I agree with the travel ban.
Right. And I agree with refugees,

159
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,360
but that's two separate things to me.

160
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:06,620
So what I'm trying to say is that none
of these policies that are happening are

161
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:10,790
not to do with one another.
They're all intertwined.

162
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:13,910
When we say we support the travel band,
but we also support refugees,

163
00:10:13,911 --> 00:10:17,120
but we also want to like help them get
back to the nations and we also want to

164
00:10:17,121 --> 00:10:18,950
do that. So we always want
to, well, don't forget,

165
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:23,420
we're funding the same bombs that
are causing the Yemenis to have to be

166
00:10:23,421 --> 00:10:23,530
[inaudible].

167
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:28,360
I'm rob. There has to be a reason,
right? So it's all connected. Right?

168
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:31,900
So, so why are we bombing Yemen?
Personally, I haven't looked into Yemen.

169
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:36,940
I guess I'm missing your point.
Refugees. He support. Yes.

170
00:10:36,941 --> 00:10:40,510
Travel ban. Muslim ban. You support.
It's not, it's not a Muslim. Yes,

171
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,720
I support a travel ban so we
can assess who's coming in.

172
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,330
I just think it's important to
contextualize like your thing.

173
00:10:46,331 --> 00:10:48,340
Nothing happens in a vacuum.
Right.

174
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,340
And I think that if we start to actually
connect the dots like I'm encouraging

175
00:10:51,341 --> 00:10:55,240
us to do, then it'll become a
lot more understandable. I mean,

176
00:10:55,241 --> 00:10:56,500
I don't believe in bombing anyone.

177
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:03,220
I would like to answer your question
about why we're bombing Yemen.

178
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:08,470
We're not bombing Yemen were bombing
radical jihadists in Yemen who are killing

179
00:11:08,471 --> 00:11:09,280
people.

180
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:14,280
That's why we're bombing parts of Yemen
selectively to kill people who are doing

181
00:11:14,441 --> 00:11:15,850
terrible,
terrible things.

182
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:21,090
And there's a tremendous amount of rape
happening in England taking these little

183
00:11:21,341 --> 00:11:24,770
girls, grooming them because they
feel they have the right to do.

184
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:28,930
We don't want that here. Those are things
we don't want in the United States.

185
00:11:28,931 --> 00:11:30,150
And one of the things that's it,

186
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,920
predatory behavior,

187
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:37,140
excuse me, we don't want know if I
could say this and you'll get mad at me,

188
00:11:37,141 --> 00:11:37,880
but if I could

189
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,270
say this,
it's not baked into their religion.

190
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:45,450
There are 109 passages in the Korean
where people are told to kill infidels and

191
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,200
and Christians and Jews.

192
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:55,230
There's nothing like that in our Bible
or the Bhagavad Gita or in anything

193
00:11:55,631 --> 00:12:00,190
Buddha taught or any other religion
I'm aware of in the world until people

194
00:12:00,191 --> 00:12:02,630
renounce those values,
right?

195
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,750
Then they scare me.

196
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:09,530
I don't think so. I haven't renounced
any part of my religion in front of you,

197
00:12:09,531 --> 00:12:13,070
so I hope that you don't
feel threatened by me,

198
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,990
so I'm not sure what you mean by that
and I won't renounce any part of Islam.

199
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:20,620
The point that I'm trying to make is that
you didn't really answer the question.

200
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:24,810
No, he did. He said the reason why we're
bombing on Yemen is to save the people.

201
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:29,340
Cause I'm assuming that in Yemen and
we've got some bad guy to keep out.

202
00:12:29,341 --> 00:12:33,270
People like that. Guys remember this,
a video of a Trump and immigrants.

203
00:12:33,271 --> 00:12:36,940
We're mixing too much.
The religion, the race,

204
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:42,210
but you shouldn't question somebody's
religion. I am very religious,

205
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:47,270
very religious and I'm not putting
anything about my religion in here.

206
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,850
I'm here to talk about me as an immigrant.

207
00:12:50,851 --> 00:12:54,450
What you guys are here to talk about
Donald Trump's like supporting him. Sure.

208
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:58,140
And yes, I've learned a lot. Like you
guys are human too. You have values.

209
00:12:58,141 --> 00:13:00,300
You who would have thought,
you know,

210
00:13:00,301 --> 00:13:05,301
that we would have found common ground
and we wouldn't like hit each other right

211
00:13:05,371 --> 00:13:06,630
here. You know, because up there,

212
00:13:06,631 --> 00:13:11,460
the media with train you guys as
bad or was this terrorist, whatever.

213
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:15,150
Right. I think the media is portraying
us all in a different light. Yeah.

214
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:17,850
I think that we're portraying ourselves
in a very different light too.

215
00:13:17,851 --> 00:13:21,810
I mean I feel very attacked just now
for my religion when I did fix that.

216
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:24,240
Talking about myself as an immigrant.
Yes, that's what I'm saying.

217
00:13:24,241 --> 00:13:27,870
You kept talking about the travel ban
is a Muslim ban that has to do with

218
00:13:27,871 --> 00:13:29,580
immigration.
It's not a Muslim ban,

219
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:34,640
but what I'm trying to just say is that
no one should have to explain Muslim,

220
00:13:35,101 --> 00:13:39,480
Christian, Jewish, none of
the above what they are too,

221
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,340
but Muslims continuously have to defend
not only their religion but their

222
00:13:44,341 --> 00:13:45,174
humanity.

223
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:50,600
What I love about this country
is the diversity. I just,

224
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:54,640
when I came here from Mexico, I just
love how there was different religions,

225
00:13:54,641 --> 00:13:59,520
different callers, different people. Like
it's amazing. It's, it's beautiful and I,

226
00:13:59,521 --> 00:14:03,610
I don't,
I don't understand how empty I'm a human.

227
00:14:03,611 --> 00:14:08,410
You have to be to discriminate someone
just because of their looks to assume

228
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:13,090
it's these preprogram thoughts in our
head from just media is what I believe.

229
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:17,050
Just blowing things out of proportion.
Just consistently,

230
00:14:17,051 --> 00:14:22,051
just outlook on minorities or the
outlook on people in certain situations.

231
00:14:22,991 --> 00:14:25,090
It's just bad.
Once you humanize someone,

232
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:30,010
when you're having a conversation and
I look past whatever these biases that

233
00:14:30,011 --> 00:14:32,320
people try to enact on me.
Right?

234
00:14:32,321 --> 00:14:35,410
Or of that I see and I started
looking at you as a person.

235
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,030
I start listening to what you're saying.

236
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:40,900
You really realize that it's not
that different. I mean we're just,

237
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:43,240
we have different situations,
we have different information,

238
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,300
but we're all trying
to do the best that way

239
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:49,760
have. I think the real interesting aspect
that I guess a lot of discrimination is

240
00:14:49,761 --> 00:14:52,010
really about is taking this idea of the

241
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:56,300
phenomenon where you can associate
my case at least like Muslims,

242
00:14:56,390 --> 00:15:01,390
terrorists equal each other and take
individuals and group them so easily with

243
00:15:01,491 --> 00:15:04,670
that sort of discrimination and I think
that's something that we have to work

244
00:15:04,671 --> 00:15:08,960
towards in terms of separating ourselves
from doing that. Thank you everybody.

245
00:15:08,961 --> 00:15:09,794
I appreciate you all.

246
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,750
I was a great discussion.

247
