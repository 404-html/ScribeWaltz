Speaker 1:          00:00          I am transgender and like that's just like something about me I felt like I'm proud of and it's like that's not the first thing I say to someone. But like, yeah, like, hi, my name is Tyler and track

Speaker 2:          00:13          a viral New York Times article featured 36 questions that could supposedly make any two people fall in love. We wanted to see what would happen if we ask these questions to two complete strangers on a blind date.

Speaker 1:          00:26          So my name is Skylar. I don't think I can even remember the last time I've been in a relationship. A little more nervous now that I'm sitting down, I realize I've never been on a blind date. I guess I'm just here to find a boyfriend. That's the short answer here. Hey, any, you know Skype twinsie twins on the Louie. I am open minded. Awkward, nervous for good. What kind of tea do you lie? I don't really like tea. I only drink tea and I'm like, and like, like really bad. So I'm like, it's he snob so I won't, maybe I can learn something by myself. No tickets alone.

Speaker 3:          01:16          Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:21          It's a hit. It's a hit s guy. You didn't fuck up too bad. Or like if a crystal ball could tell you the truth about yourself, the future or anything else? Well, would you want to know if I knew something significant? Well, anything really. I feel like battle, like shape the way that I'm kinda like doing this awkward like thing. I don't think I would want to know. What about you? I guess what I would want to know is like whether I'm going to find true happiness in life. One day one of the crystal ball says no. Like, are you going gonna just going to be like, well, I'm not going to be happy. So I'm out of. So I don't know. I guess I would rather know than just keep living for nothing. Right. Or is that like a very like, I mean for me, I didn't look up for me, I don't know.

Speaker 1:          02:06          Maybe that's a little personal because like as a kid, like I was so was so depressed, so depressed and I got to the point where I honestly felt like life wasn't worth living. And, um, and now I'm like happy with who I am and what my life has to offer. Even light on the roller coaster up and downs of it. No, I can relate to the, I feel like, I'm not going to say who it is, but there was someone in my life, I would always just come home like shout at my mom and I am just like, I felt like trapped almost and I couldn't get out of the situation the second I laughed. That's like when my happiness like chewy started hopping. So your own crystal ball, my own story.

Speaker 1:          02:51          Is there something that you dreamed of doing for a long time and why haven't you done it? I think traveling the world is somebody I wanted to that I haven't had the opportunity til I travel as much as I want to. I just wish that there weren't so many boundaries to that. Like almost like if money and like other things weren't in bed said like if we were all just like cave men and we were just like all walking across the land is doing it, the whole thing. Oh. So we can all just travel across the world. I want to try it well too. I actually haven't been outside of the U S and in point, um, what I dreamed to do, but I haven't done yet. It's just like really goal like 1000000000% with like my art and just like put it out there and just be really unapologetic and like super confident and all of that.

Speaker 1:          03:43          I think what's, what's stopping me is my confidence honestly. Like it's like a, it's like a journey. Like I remember, um, being like a super like non-competing guy. I wouldn't share any of my like passions or talents or anything with anyone. And now I'm like at this place where I'm like working on things and putting things out there. Just exposing bits and pieces of stuff myself so I can kind of make it happen. Yeah. So it's going to happen, but like right now I'm like in transit, I'm in transit. It hasn't happened yet, but once my confidence is on point that I think it'll, it'll be there. If you were going to become close friends with your partner, please share. What would be important for him or her to know? Dang, how would I explain this? Like at the end of the day, the most important relationship that they have is the one they have with themselves.

Speaker 1:          04:37          And I'm here to supplement that. Especially in our generation. Like everything is so instant. Everything is so, um, expectation loaded. Like you'd do something and you're like, expect something kind of fun. Like I would really, really want them to know that I'm like, not that, that's awesome. How about Chou? I think what I would want my partner to know and like what my, all my friends know about me is that like I'm transgender and like, that's just like something about me that like I'm proud of. Obviously I would tell my partner that as like my, all my friends know, obviously it's like a part of who I am. Like that's not the first thing I say to someone. Right. But like, yeah, like, hi, my name's Tyler and track. Um, but like I've been on such a journey to get to where I am in terms of my mentality and my mental state, like who I am. It's an important cause. The shapes like all of your experience, the wall that ones say all of you experienced with him in a lot of different ways. Other eyes? Three or four minutes. I want to take some way.

Speaker 3:          05:52          Okay, we're ready. Oh

Speaker 1:          06:05          I wouldn't describe Schuyler as I would say silly. She's a little shy and nervous but very authentic. He's like pure at heart. He really does want the best for people. I can tell she was like garden and she like kind of like let me in a little bit which was just enough seeing like how that Kinda took her to a different place to me to a different place and it was like a roller coaster.

Speaker 3:          06:43          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          06:46          Like when you're like trying not to laugh in class cause your friend's last name like you said.

Speaker 3:          06:51          Would you be interested in such a date?
