Speaker 1:          00:00          So those would be sharp minutes.

Speaker 2:          00:21          So where are we going to do, we're going to pair you with an artist, artists that you've never met and never seen him before, but in artists that typically people wouldn't associated with your freedom and y'all are going to make something together.

Speaker 3:          00:32          How are you feeling right now on your emotional climate for it?

Speaker 4:          00:35          Anxious. Excited. Oh Man. Where are you to do something really cool?

Speaker 1:          00:46          Great.

Speaker 3:          00:54          Hello? Hello. How's it going? Sorry, I'm Jessica. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Okay. Oh, is it a violin? I was completely surprised when d sharp walks in. I definitely automatically assumed that it was going to be me with a dancer.

Speaker 4:          01:17          Yeah. And I do a lot of like electronic music. Yeah. It's just like pop in things that you wouldn't normally expect to see with a classical instrument. Okay, cool. I actually had no idea. I kind of had a feeling that it wasn't going to be a musician, but a pleasant surprise. Okay. So all right. Well

Speaker 1:          01:36          yeah, no. So

Speaker 3:          01:48          we need to make something.

Speaker 4:          01:53          What made you like one of the, what's it like kind of one of those things?

Speaker 3:          01:58          No, it's like I say, well studied dance in a college setting and I was like, I want to do something like really like Raunchy and out of the box and like I don't want anyone to know about it. And then I went to class and my teacher, she was like doing all this beautiful stuff in the air and I was like, she looks like a ballerina. As soon as my first day was over I was like, why is, why are no dancers doing pole? Because it's looked down upon as like a sexual erotic. I mean that's why I took class. I was the appeal for me. Then when I showed up and saw how beautiful it was, I was like, this is exactly what I do is just, yeah,

Speaker 4:          02:30          different form. So interesting because I feel like I kind of had a similar path like, because you know, starting with classical music, I was going to always at rebel kids who like I wasn't wanting to learn like the songs off the radio.

Speaker 3:          02:43          Yeah. We're the Weirdos, pretty much doing stuff. We're like, why can't you do this? Right. If I think like laying down and playing would be cool. Like, and then like maybe if you're walking through, um,

Speaker 1:          02:56          okay,

Speaker 4:          02:57          this is hard move if towards the beginning

Speaker 1:          03:00          of his life, even a struggle between maybe it doesn't really work out really beautifully at first. Yeah. And then we kind of have, we both have a similar, we'll go down with similar message photo. Okay.

Speaker 5:          03:59          So this is just what it sounds like

Speaker 3:          04:08          great. Today. Like getting to play with d sharp is like I love classical elements and the way he brings it into a more modern feel. This is like my jam. Like I love hearing those ideas taken into like this new way.

Speaker 1:          04:31          Okay.

Speaker 3:          04:33          Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Okay.

Speaker 1:          04:36          I think it's really fascinating how we have so much in common, but even though we come from completely different worlds, our battle has still been somewhat similar. Like getting to where we are today.

Speaker 3:          04:48          I have not met anybody that's so like me and so different than me at the same time. So I feel like we get along perfectly because we're very strong and what we liked, but we also are very open to each other's ideas. So it was cool to collaborate. Overall, I think it's going to be good, but I don't know. We'll see. I'm definitely nervous, but, um, I'm excited and I'm happy for this opportunity, so I'm excited to do it. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          05:28          Rolling. Oh,
