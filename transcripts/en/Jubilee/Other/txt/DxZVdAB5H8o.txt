Speaker 1:          00:00          Julian, right? Julian? Julian. Yes. You got it. Yes. You're you. You're the one that loves to sing. So big question. What is your ideal first date? We, I don't think I'm the one that actually he likes the same but that's okay. Oh Gosh. Oh, so sorry.

Speaker 2:          00:27          How do you think you get to know someone without actually seeing them in person? If it's through a conversation over a phone, then you get to know them. That's why I really love telemarketers when they give me a call because then we can jive and have a great conversation from there. But two, when it comes to photos, you just swipe to see who you think is the most attractive. And I don't think that's necessarily the best way to get to know someone. But

Speaker 3:          00:54          yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:12          Hello, how are you? I'm good. How are you? Life is a beautiful, what's your name? And uh, do you have any siblings? Hey, yeah, my name is Liz and I actually have three younger siblings. Nice. Yes. Hi, I'm Victoria. I have two younger siblings that are eight and 10 years apart from me. And I liked to play tennis. I'm Sabrina, but people call me Sabz but with like a Z. Oh yeah. But you know different. I want to be different. Most of my days I do jumping jacks sort of how you, hi, my name is Diana and I love food. And what do you mean by you do jumping jacks favor on this week? This week in and out? I don't know the secret menu protein. Burger. Lettuce. Yeah. Hello. My name is Jonathan and I love singing in the shower. Are you a shower person? I am a shy person.

Speaker 1:          02:04          Are you morning or night? Quick morning shower. Yeah. I'm a morning shower person too. And then my name is [inaudible]. By the way, being Hispanic, I'm Hispanic. There's a lot of me. It's hard to be vegetarian in both of our cultures. I'm Kiana like, well all my friends call me key. So I like that. Yeah, I remember like key to your heart. That's like basically how you're gonna remember me above. Oh, I love how you said that. Kiana. I love food. I've told her brothers who they like individuals that are men that walk into the place where they want to ask you out on a date. I mean, they don't get involved in my business. We're really distant. Are you close with their siblings?

Speaker 2:          02:39          Super close. That's why I'm kind of like a child, but also mature at the same time, but mostly a child.

Speaker 1:          02:54          Oh Gosh. I feel really bad. Um, I'm going to do, uh, Courtney. I was

Speaker 2:          03:00          unable to really get to know her right away. And then Coco, you know, I've dated people before that had rough siblings and that usually didn't turn out right. So, uh, those are the two reasons why,

Speaker 1:          03:22          um, ideal first date. Um, I like things really super chill. So going to a coffee shop, going on a hike and I love hiking. That's, that's exactly what I love too. Yeah. Well my favorite is we start off with something small. Like a hike. Yes. And then if it's cooler than that, then it's like, oh, do you want to do an activity like rock climbing? Wait, I climbed till God, you were joking. I really like the beach. I love the water so, and I haven't been in awhile, so I think that would be really cool. I think the best part of the day is just to talk. So I really liked seeing places. I like walking around somewhere. So I do love art museums. Do you like single dates or let's say there's like a group setting of the day. Ooh, I've never done like a group day.

Speaker 1:          04:03          I've never done a double date. So that could be something fun to experience. Okay. Alright, Julian, right? Julian? Julian? Yeah. You got it. Yes. You're you. You're the one that loves to sing. So big question. What is your ideal first date? Yeah. I don't think I'm the one that actually likes the same, but that's okay. Oh Gosh. Oh, so sorry. Okay. My I do first day. I would love to do something where we can talk, but also where we're doing something kind of active like mini golfing or bullying, I think anything food related I love like anything like Greek or anything. Did you know you live longer if you eat Mediterranean food? So they say, we really, sorry, I didn't. So you're going to be able to like live all very long life. Anything outdoorsy is pretty much really like my ideal date. Sounds like a lot of fun to do. That sounds fun. Um,

Speaker 2:          04:55          that's cool.

Speaker 1:          04:58          Wait, you're a vocal director. Do you have law students as well? Yeah. So you're a teacher teaching. Okay. All right. Bye.

Speaker 3:          05:09          Okay.

Speaker 2:          05:10          Oh, they're, they're all really great. I am. Okay. So the first one, yeah, kick me out and I apologize again. Is Brianna the energy? I guess it's just different. That's it. We're just two different energies. I like Mclean. I like, uh, like chill.

Speaker 3:          05:29          Yana

Speaker 1:          05:32          I hope I, I hope I have picked the right one. I, oh gosh.

Speaker 3:          05:37          Okay.

Speaker 1:          05:37          Liz, what is your deal breaker when it comes to dating? I think it's about extending generosity to other people and giving them an open and safe space and someone doesn't provide that then that's a pretty big deal breaker for me. I want the person that I'm going to be in a relationship or whatever, um, to be able to give me the independence. It would someone who had like low emotional intelligence. If it was someone who that was way too dependent on me and the relationship so we can not complete one another, but we can come together and build each other up. I think a big deal breaker for me as someone who isn't honest, if you're not Vegan, I don't want to date you. I'm joking. I'm joking. I'm Vegan, but that's not a deal breaker, right? You're like, okay, God, why did you say that? But I love how you placed. That's what's so special about you is that you love to play it back about you. Yes. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          06:30          Sorry, I'm going to hear it. Three. Okay. This is sound big, but Kiani and the reason why is because we're here to like have a relationship, but I would love to be her friend. I think she would be so dope as a friend. Probably Jill as well.

Speaker 3:          06:53          Uh,

Speaker 2:          06:55          Victoria out. Oh God. Maybe I do like Victoria. This,

Speaker 1:          07:03          this is, you're pressuring me. I mean, I'd love to keep traveling. I love traveling overseas. Um, but I also would like really love to have a family someday. So I guess those are two. What do you mean by some day? Uh, like have a family someday. Like, well, how many years out do you think? I'm probably in the next five, whatever I'm doing, I want to be helping people and I know that when I'm helping people, I'm proud of myself. Oh my gosh. I just made my heart. Oh really? Yeah. I'm currently a student. I'm a third year Undergrad, so, um, right now I'm studying education, so my goal is to become a teacher one day.

Speaker 2:          07:49          It's, Oh gosh, uh, I think I'm going to, hopefully I'm right with my notes. I feel, I apologize, but I'm going to go with, with Liz.

Speaker 1:          08:01          God,

Speaker 2:          08:04          Hey.

Speaker 1:          08:06          I mean I've never been on a blind date, like literally or Nice, you know, so I'm a little, am I a little, I mean a lot nervous. I'm also really excited.

Speaker 2:          08:18          Would you like to see each other? Do you want to see each other or do you want to see each other later?

Speaker 1:          08:26          Like right now, right now. Hi Can we do, we did that hog in the hug was, I was like, oh my gosh. It's a little awkward at first because it's like so much at one moment. Ah, this is exciting. This is moving away now. And then I'm moving back of your socks by the way. Thanks. And so I took a step back to hopefully give her that space. You could also show me the moves that you have when it comes to, uh, when it comes to a climbing, climbing. Yes. Hopefully after this weekend,

Speaker 2:          08:56          exchange contact information, if she's down, of course, it's all about if she's willing, because I would love to, to figure out if there is chemistry, you know, based on just conversing. So, yeah.
