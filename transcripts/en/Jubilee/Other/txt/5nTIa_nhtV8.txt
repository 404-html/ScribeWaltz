Speaker 1:          00:01          Oh my God. Oh Wow, whoa.

Speaker 2:          00:12          So we were very nervous, but at the same time we were excited to come out of her comfort zone and just something different than what we were shooting with. I Dunno, I think I'm going to be a painter. Other musicians, maybe dancers. Oh yeah. Maybe it could be anything.

Speaker 3:          00:38          Youtube,

Speaker 2:          00:39          we come in and we usually have music in front of us. I really had no idea anything can be thrown at us. What if it's like a disco band? I'd love that. So we are all members of counties, quartet string quartet based in La, and we donate a portion of all our proceeds to charitable organizations dedicated to animal. Hello, my name is Maddie Martinez. [inaudible] Maria cheese style. My Dad, she's killed [inaudible] to edition and it's very special to us.

Speaker 1:          01:21          Ah,

Speaker 2:          01:22          I'm ready.

Speaker 1:          01:34          Oh my God.

Speaker 2:          01:40          Other musicians. That's great.

Speaker 4:          01:42          Well we could hear it walking in. I was pretty psyched because I like Mariachi music lights so joyous and you can't help but feel happy. And so you're a Mariachi band. Yes, we, what's the name of your group

Speaker 2:          01:52          that's Mariachi mean does make it kind of, any other nation thinks that will make it go. They think of all edge. It's an a good patient of musicians. I play specific instruments that are made only for the sound of the Mariachi for someone who was trained class play to try to play other genres of music has been great in that regard. To explore other donors and play like desperate cdot. It's actually pretty fun. And besides that we like to empower women through our music and power people. Do you know to keep going to keep pushing to keep learning?

Speaker 4:          02:27          Vicki maybe we could take like a classical tune. Maybe we can add something with this. I don't know. I have a canon in d or something. You can, okay. We can take a piece that we know it's a popular class when music piece, but I'm thinking like we start with something and I mean like really passionate and serious. And then after like one or two phrases, we'd kind of like more fit and can second really fun thing. When you play with a small group of people, four people, three people, you're all communicating, you're all listening to each other. There's still the basics of rhythm and the chord structure is all there.

Speaker 2:          02:56          It's kind of scary at the same time because you don't know what kind of musical level they are.

Speaker 4:          03:02          I was curious, could this fit themselves into this piece without having music in front of them and they could immediately just learn the chords and then they make it sound like a completely new version of it

Speaker 3:          03:12          guy's gonna come like jump in and try it. Yeah. Hours to it first. What can you tone it is indeed.

Speaker 5:          03:27          So he started playing nicer feeling thought, you know, the male would be okay.

Speaker 3:          03:41          Okay. So yeah. What do you guys got? What do we got left Wednesday? Wednesday is a fountain.

Speaker 5:          03:55          classically trained musicians tend to stick to the notes. Mariachi players are amazing. We did a lot of times it could just learn it by here because debt, the switch you can drop of a dime. So block expressing her feelings and release their emotions through music.

Speaker 2:          04:13          Oh, okay.

Speaker 3:          04:15          I love that song. The guy, what's the shallow? Reminds me of Madison. Very goofy, very upbeat. Very funny.

Speaker 2:          04:38          I made up the lyrics and it was facey cause they're like one minute and make, make up the lyrics. I think they come at good. I lost you and I thought I was not going to find youth today. I found you all my love. I very antsy to love you.

Speaker 3:          04:58          I believe that you are from Mars. So it's kind of like, whoa. Then I, I lost you and then I found you and then, well yes you want to, you don't want it. They're just
