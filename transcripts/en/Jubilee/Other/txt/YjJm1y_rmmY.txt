Speaker 1:          00:00          Um, three, you look great. A viral New York Times article featured 36 questions that could supposedly make any two people fall in love. We wanted to see what would happen if we ask these questions to two complete strangers on a blind date. My name is Michael Joe. Just turned 25, um, two weeks ago. Pretty good. I'm feeling that kind of existential dread, um, quarter life crisis. I'm kind of ready for something new. Something less brief. Hello. Hi. Hi Michael. It's such a dramatic entrance. My name is Andrew Morrison. I have my own film production company. I work with clients in the travel industry. Thank you. I just came from work. This isn't like your everyday wear. This is pretty much like what I wear to work. So really a good fit. Good. Taylor. Thank you. Thank you. Like I'm not as, I wish I were. Yeah, let's pour this

Speaker 2:          01:21          and

Speaker 1:          01:23          I don't think it's ready, but I'm thirsty. The little chairs, I guess you don't do that with tape, but I like your style.

Speaker 2:          01:34          Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:37          What do you do? Um, you want to know that first? It's really random. I buy rocks. Things like kitchens, like countertops or like hamburger. Yeah, sure. Kind of like that. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:52          Take four minutes and tell your partner your life story in as much detail as possible.

Speaker 1:          01:57          You don't want to go first. You go put the pressure on me. I want to get to know you. Okay. Kirpan Seritos most of my family lived in La. I worked in fashion for a bit about four years and it was on the manufacturing side. I came to really resent it. Really? Yeah. Because every negative image about like the fashion industry is pretty true. You know, that's how I found myself buying rocks, I guess. Who Am about you?

Speaker 3:          02:25          Okay. Um, I am from a town called Scandia in Minnesota. I grew up on a farm there. I wanted to leave a lot earlier. I had been traveling the world a lot with my father. I would say what really kind of marked and impacted my youth was I lost my aunt and my father to cancer when I was kind of ending high school and my grandmother had a stroke. All that kind of just made me look at life differently. I stopped looking at life as about just saving up for retirement and four one ks and Roth Iras and structure and I was like, I'm going to hustle the seeds of all that. We're um, that I was an entrepreneur and an artist or like living there.

Speaker 4:          03:09          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          03:12          If a crystal ball could tell you the truth about yourself, your life, the future or anything else, what would you want

Speaker 1:          03:20          to know? Something I've been thinking about a lot recently, especially with that friendship question is like what is the family that I'm going to end up with? Not too long ago, my grandpa passed away. The one thing that I remember one of my family members saying was, um, he was really lucky to have his entire family in the area to be with him as he passed. And that just got me thinking, who are the family members that are going to be with me at the end of my life? Um, who are the friends I consider my friends family as well. So

Speaker 3:          03:56          what you said about your Grandpa, I mean that's, that's 100% true. When my dad was sick and my sisters and I took care of him and you know, that was something that every day it was like, it was almost like a song he would sing. He was just so grateful that we were all there and we were like, well, of course. Once you've seen that, once you've experienced it in some, to some degree, you realize how important that is.

Speaker 1:          04:21          Alternate sharing something you consider a positive characteristic of your partner. Share a total of five items. Oh, let's do it. I want to go first.

Speaker 3:          04:32          Yeah, I sense this sort of um, compassion that you have really seems like you care and that makes me trust you even though I've just met you two, I think. I think you are brave for making a lot of these choices you have in your life to follow the career paths that, that you want. You're making these choices and you're following your heart and it seems like you have the willpower and the drive to succeed. Three, you look great for. I really just admire that you are from this place. You have that sort of glow and positive energy that's represents Los Angeles and California. Hello, our sweat

Speaker 4:          05:18          glow. And um,

Speaker 3:          05:22          not many people relax me, but you've very relaxing, very calming. You have this groundedness to you that I just desire but we'll never ever be. So I think that's such a gift.

Speaker 1:          05:36          I felt the same way about you honestly. I'm not just like turning it around. Like when you first walked out, I was like, this guy seems so chill.

Speaker 3:          05:44          I'm gonna have to ensure that all of my Walkin's or that

Speaker 4:          05:46          long one mile space though. No. Yeah, it was, oh,

Speaker 1:          05:53          I find you extremely warm, which I think is not common, especially now hearing your story, you definitely seem extremely driven and I think that's awesome. You don't just think of your goals here and like, okay, I'm going to start a business so I'm going to do it. And you started a production company and kind of to tie in with, uh, the first point that I made it seem very familiar. Mm. I find it fairly easy to open up to you and you're very open, which is, which is great. Yeah. Not going to lie coming into this. Um, I was pretty nervous. Yeah. You have helped me realize. I'm glad you're here. That's really cool. The final task is without speaking, stare into each other's eyes for four minutes, for four minutes. So, um, let's do it. Okay. Hmm. Michael is a very grounded, empathetic, and compassionate person. He's a total feeler. Looking at him, I would've said he's fucking cool and dress well. I want to get to know him so much more. She's for sure kind of different from a lot of the people I've met here in la. Maybe I've grown accustomed to community here and that's just kind of what I expect everyone to be like.

Speaker 1:          07:48          He was just very different, which I really liked.

Speaker 2:          07:55          Ooh,

Speaker 1:          08:02          I was so bizarre. Yeah. Really? Why? Oh my God, I can feel the jet lag. No. Oh No. For like a brief minute, like everything got really blurry except for your face. I was just looking at a Monica for now dean here and I'm glad you did this and this inspired me to just have more meaningful discussions with people that I meet anywhere. It was nice to kind of just open up to

Speaker 5:          08:31          someone you knew nothing about.

Speaker 1:          08:36          I would, I would definitely be interested in a second thing, Michael. I think he's gonna do great things in life. Yeah, for sure.

Speaker 5:          08:46          MMM.

Speaker 1:          08:48          Whether it's as friends

Speaker 5:          08:52          explore something further.

Speaker 1:          08:57          This is actually kind of an amazing experience to be flying in and meeting you right away. You're being like kind of welcome. It's cool. Michael, welcome.
