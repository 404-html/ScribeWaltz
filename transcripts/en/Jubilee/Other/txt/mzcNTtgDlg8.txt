Speaker 1:          00:00          I'd seen all these negative things saying, Oh, if you're a Trump supporter, you're a Nazi, you're this, you're that. And I'm not those things. I love my country. I love my president.

Speaker 2:          00:13          Okay. Probably three, two, one.

Speaker 1:          00:40          I disagree because I have literally gotten death threats for expressing my public opinion on politics, on supported the president. I mean, I'm not going to stop expressing my opinion, but I still disagree that I feel safe doing so. I think most Americans don't at this time.

Speaker 3:          00:56          I do not believe that suppressing my opinions from people does anything good for the, for the betterment of society, but it's part member of the LGBT community. It's pretty hard to hold those views. Um, and I just purposefully make a decision that I'm going to be responsible for my own safety and um, I don't let anybody intimidate me that way.

Speaker 4:          01:18          Me, I'm a skateboarder and an industry that is pretty much dominantly liberal where the graphics are of Trump shaking hands with the KKK. I've been spit on before. I've been cursed at. I've had my board tried to be broken from skateboarders even though I don't feel safe at wearing it publicly, I will continue to do so because I will not have my voice silence

Speaker 2:          01:37          issues about three two. Why

Speaker 5:          01:52          I somewhat agree that they're not important. Let me tell you, let me explain why. Because the same issues of the black community affect all communities and if we are Americans, if we truly consider ourselves Americans, my issues are no different from his issued or hurry shoes or her issues or her issues or his issues, whether you're white or black or brown or green.

Speaker 1:          02:13          I'm going to say I strongly disagree and all due respect. I disagree because there are different issues in the black community then are in other communities. There's higher crime rates, there's higher abortion rates, there's crime and violence within this community. There's a lot of hatred within my community being black against police officers and those are specific to the black community.

Speaker 5:          02:36          That is a very good point, but we as Americans, whether you're black, brown or white, you have a certain obligation to the civil society. So I have the obligation to stop when the police officer says stop. So I'm giving that as an example, which is happened in many cases where abuse has followed because the black runs and he fights back.

Speaker 1:          02:58          I agree with that, but

Speaker 2:          03:00          what you just said, you took 20 seconds to explain a black issue, so he, it is a problem, but of course everyone is responsible for that problem, but this community is hurting and they're just as American as everybody else. Oh, ball three two. What

Speaker 4:          03:26          I strongly agree that we need the wall. It's not a matter of racial issues, but national security, let me say that first. First off, every one out of every three illegals comes with a federal crime, whether it's murder or rape or even drug cartel. Also, we talked about black issues. What about the illegal immigrants that come that are dreamers, but what about the American black dream or his dream is to be a lawyer. His dream to go to college and his dreams to become something and get out the hood. The Sally, we allow these illegals to one pass. Those who are waiting for a long time to illegally come to the country because there is a difference and it's almost a slap in the face.

Speaker 1:          03:58          I do know at my school, it's a public university. They give out free college to undocumented students. Yet here I am. I come from a middle class family, but I don't get any scholarships like I get very little. I can barely afford college at these people who aren't even US citizens. They get all these benefits that I myself as an American citizen can't get. Yeah,

Speaker 6:          04:18          I somewhat agree to this. I think the wall is, is useful and essential, but the real issue is what can we do to make our country have a much easier system to, for people to come in in a legal fashion. It's the procedure that is too difficult, too long, too cumbersome. We'd love to have him come in. They benefit us, they help us to grow. They provide new ideas, but let's be rational about this and to keep it equal with the citizens of this country who are already here.

Speaker 1:          04:52          Aye.

Speaker 2:          04:56          Three. Two. Why?

Speaker 4:          05:05          I guess the reason I somewhat agree, it depends what you mean by a support. If anyone Derris to mess with her, I'm gonna kick their ass. So like she's got my support 100% but if you're asking me as a Christian, I'm going to loves him and matter what they are. We're all, like I said, it's an American issue and we're all supposed to give this together.

Speaker 5:          05:22          If it's contrary to natural law, which it is in my view, then I don't agree with it. However, I can, like you as a person with the LGBT community that is in a pretty much has morphed into a gay rights organization. So they fight for rights that are outside of the natural rights of the declaration of independence, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness within the boundaries of natural law. So that's why I don't support the LGBT community in bear activism, but I do support them as human beings with the same rights as I have no extra rights, no extra right to marry. Same Sex, but the same, right as I have

Speaker 3:          06:07          put your, put your right, say you can marry whoever you want. Oh, very good. Okay. Good point. There are a lot of features in the LGBT community. There are a little bit hard to deal with. I don't identify with a lot of those people identify as a transgender person, not necessarily as a gay or lesbian person. My wife on the other hand, all of a sudden found herself in a same sex marriage. Uh, it was not something that you signed up for. Same sex marriage is a different thing, but who cares who you love? I'm very active in the Republican Party and I'm trying to make a big inroads with the religious freedom and the super conservative religious people because they need to learn to deal with me because I'm going, I'm not going anywhere. You know, you live your life, you doesn't agree with my life. I shouldn't feel compelled to affect your life because I don't agree with it.

Speaker 2:          07:01          Is it good role model or are three, two, one

Speaker 1:          07:09          hell yeah. Probably gonna get a lot of flack for this. I strongly agree. He's strong and he is fighting for Americans. He listens to what we want and yeah, he doesn't always tweet the best stuff, but I mean everybody's done that. But the fact of the matter is that he has principles and now he's standing for what he believes in and he's taking us to the future. A safer, better, stronger America for all of us.

Speaker 4:          07:32          A reason why someone agrees because I don't think any president should be a role model for children. I think there should be a role model for American, like American men and grown adults. So I don't think Trump should be a role model for children because if so he had to be PC all the damn time, which does nothing but heard Americans. He's the old school. Tell you straight up, see your face. The doctor that tells you the truth, he tells you you got to lose a hundred pounds and stop smoking and you'll die. You get mad, you might get assaulted, but you find out he's only one telling you the truth.

Speaker 6:          07:58          I somewhat agree as well because I think that he's a good role model because he sets out what he's going to do and then he goes and does it and he's also a good role model because of some of the things he says, which is not acceptable and that is what real life is about. It's not that somebody is perfect and never make some mistake. People make mistakes. They repent from their mistakes and they go out and do something positive.

Speaker 2:          08:31          Three, two, one. Ah, that's such a hard one.

Speaker 1:          08:39          I did lose a couple of friends. I went to school with a Trump shirt on and I brought a Trump flag and waved it around. I had a couple teachers get really mad at me and that may have affected my grade at the end of the year, even though I lost some relationships. I've built really good friends and I just really get along with who think similar to me or accept what I think. They don't have to agree with me. But if you're in a community where people can accept you for who you are, those are the true people you need to surround yourself in. I mean, I lost friends, family members, supporters, business associates. When I came out for Donald Trump in 2017 February at the grammys, I wore dresses. I said make America great again. So I knew I would, you know, create a stir but hitting number one on iTunes, Amazon billboard, my album rose to number one because of Trump supporters. So I've lost things. What I've also maintained this new community based on who I truly am,

Speaker 5:          09:35          know any relationship that you lose as a result of supporting Trump has no real relationship anyway because he's only there temporarily. I mean, this is what everybody keeps forgetting. I mean, this guy is only going to be here for what, another four or five years. And so I want to remind everybody of that. You know, it's not the end of the world. Not yet. It's getting there, but not yet.

Speaker 1:          09:59          Great again. Alright, three, two, one.

Speaker 2:          10:06          I mean it's Kinda easy.

Speaker 1:          10:10          Oh, come on. You can get over here.

Speaker 3:          10:12          I strongly agree. Um, there's some issues. The man has got some idiosyncrasies to drive us all a little bit nuts, but overall, I mean, he's a businessman. He knows how to make business happen.

Speaker 1:          10:22          I mean, we're, we're talking the fact that we're even talking Sherpa. Some people are grumpy and don't like what he tweets, but you're having conversations about it. He's waking up. So he is making America great again, is making America, dare I say it woke again.

Speaker 5:          10:35          Trump is making America great again, but the people around him are trying to undermine him. And even in his own party, he can only do so much. He's not a dictator. And this is where we have to remember that.

Speaker 2:          10:53          Okay. That's right.
