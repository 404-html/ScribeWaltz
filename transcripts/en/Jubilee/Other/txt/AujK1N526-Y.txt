Speaker 1:          00:02          People see the end result, which is a shiny red airplane. And they go, well that's nice. You know, like that's, that's cool. But like, it's more to me than that's the reflection. Everything I had to do to turn that growing up for me was like, I did have energy, but I don't have anywhere to put it. He Sky Surfing, we love you so much. And he teaches us cleaning. So like at school, um, I was put in special Ed. They didn't like, I just felt like nobody, nobody believed like I was capable of anything. It was just like being in timeout. I would just sit there and,

Speaker 2:          01:18          okay.

Speaker 1:          01:18          Not really do a lot. When you become like unconfident, you don't know how to, how to recover from that.

Speaker 2:          01:28          Oh,

Speaker 1:          01:31          I don't have a really good way of being like other people.

Speaker 2:          01:35          Oh,

Speaker 1:          01:39          I was just bullied enough for teas to where I thought I am weird. I was really restless and at this school, like the institution just does, it wasn't speaking to me at all. I really needed to find something that I was passionate about. Oh, you found it right at the right time.

Speaker 2:          01:59          Oh,

Speaker 1:          02:00          dad left in order the office and picking you up. Don't take the bus. And he picked me up from school that day and there was a leak in the hangar and we had to fix some sheet rock. Even from the day my dad gave me that note in school like that was the beginning of the chain that changes your life and you never know what it is until you look back. First Time I came to the airport and saw the airplane, I saw something I wanted to be involved in for the rest of my life and at that point I was like, whatever it takes. I met Matt Gugan, probably the most influential personality and Matt showed me help with things that he was working on it and I was actually getting really interested in. I was like, oh, this is how it works like this and this is how this works. I was placing, the blocks are so long and now coming out to this airport, I felt like I was out of that box. Mac put me on these floats that need to be told apart. So there was like a couple thousand rivets and I just started drilling on one.

Speaker 3:          03:02          I think having somebody believe in me sparked the EXEC. We were working on airplanes now you know I'm 14,

Speaker 1:          03:08          we're working on airplanes and he is expecting me to do at your job. He knows not going to be perfect at the time, but I kept trying really hard and you recognize that I started using my special ed hours reading like ground school budget, everything I didn't learn in Algebra. Ended up learning in metal shop. Now they have the contrast like school doesn't care. And then Mac and the people in the airport like caring, like they believe in me and I was kind of addicted to it. I just kept coming here and eventually they start paying me. I knew as a freshman I was at least going to be a pilot as it have an airplane. I didn't know exactly I was going to do it. Um, but this was a star improve. People say like if you want something, you have to want it more than you want to breathe. Wanting that airplane, there was no option to quit on it because I was identifying with that when I was in a hunt for the Cessna one 70 Mack had already said, you should get a project. My Dad called and said that his boss knew where one was and Max is all you just, you got to buy that one max, like Spitz's ice tea and it's dripping out of his like white beard. I said, Okay Dad, you know, I guess, I guess we're buying it.

Speaker 1:          04:28          When we found the plane, it was green and white, somebody, he'd carve their name into it. So it was this old banged up fuselage without any wings on or anything and it was, it was a wreck, but like it had the potential. Yeah, it was excited. I mean I was only 15 and I know, and an airplane. Yeah, sure it can fly, but it didn't matter. It still still upset. I owned an airplane and the registry, so I own one. When I was younger I was definitely more impatient and wanting to get things, wanting to do like the action and get like get in it and get things done and kicking.

Speaker 4:          05:18          People thought like, Oh, we bought an airplane. He'll get bored of it eventually. I couldn't imagine not finishing it. I would work like 10 hours a day and I started building this plant up and things were, things were looking pretty good, but nothing ever really goes according to plan. A lot of help today going on, Sam, I just wish she knew what I even did. Earn a hundred bucks so that goodbye screws. I did some construction jobs. I dug ditches. I worked at a refinery to pay for the rent on the hanger. I even spent months up in Alaska fishing for salmon and fish like years just to earn as much as I could.

Speaker 2:          06:06          Okay.

Speaker 4:          06:07          I was out in these storms that are telling them to 12 foot waves, 30 knot winds. I officially am til 11:00 AM and then again from 3:00 PM to 11:00 PM and you learn how to like sleep outside, like lean against the war. I'm exhausted. Sleep outside, put on, try to like channel that warm air coming out of the manifold that like getting hypoxia or anything fishing taught me a lot no matter what. When it's time to fish, I have a question. You don't quit

Speaker 1:          06:48          building the plane itself wasn't the hard part of it.

Speaker 2:          06:51          Okay.

Speaker 1:          06:52          The hardest thing has been, you know, keeping motivated through the entire process and like absolutely not taking no for an answer and doing whatever it takes to really get that done.

Speaker 2:          07:07          Uh,

Speaker 1:          07:12          I couldn't imagine not finishing it. I could probably go over every part and just tell you like the experiences building, just that or what happened to get that part. I was laying with a learning disability, but by 21 I became a certified mechanic. If finish college 708 quarters early, I'm private pilot and I built my own airplane. I didn't let what anybody else thought of me dictate what I do doubt myself. And it's not uncommon for me to doubt myself, but then I see how far the planes coming and how much progress had maintenance, and there's no way I can go back on that. If you want something bad enough, we truly want something bad enough, then you have to make the sacrifices. I could buy steak, but I by airplane parts instead. This is just the beginning of this. What's next for me is to have the experience of flying a serp plan every state, and that's really important to me because I know that there's a lot more than just country to see, and the plane is the perfect way you do that.
