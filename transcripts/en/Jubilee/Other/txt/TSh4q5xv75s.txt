Speaker 1:          00:00          Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yo, Yo, what's good? Yo brief.

Speaker 2:          00:13          Hey, hey

Speaker 3:          00:18          dancing or Brandon like popular songs. This are fun. And I was like, hey. And actually it looks good and it looks Kinda cool. So I just kept doing that and then it started blowing up and I just went with it. It's like, why not? Like if you're 1415 and you're just starting to get a lot of followers on Instagram as not something you just said.

Speaker 2:          00:37          No worries.

Speaker 3:          00:45          My name is Russell, but people know me as backpack kid. I'm 16 years old and I am a content creator.

Speaker 1:          01:01          So I'm from Atlanta, Georgia and I'm really just a normal teenage kid and I just started doing videos on the Internet and these blew up. You ain't on the list. Got To do better. What did they think? They thought I was just doing me having fun. So they just went along with it. They let me travel with a manager. Not a lot of parents would do that.

Speaker 2:          01:33          Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:36          How many? I would say maybe two. Almost three. So a lot has happened in the past two to three years. Do you invent? Yes. Most celebrities that you can think of have probably done the dance before

Speaker 2:          01:58          and then I went on

Speaker 1:          01:59          SNL with Katy Perry and that's when it really, really, really popped off. Wait, you said what? I can do that now before noon on a Monday. Okay. Okay. Okay, and what are you about to post a me philosophy with bronze burner. Yeah. I'll tell you why. Heavyweight champion. Yeah. Nice. All right. Yes. Cool. And then also a part right here and then like a design on this side.

Speaker 1:          02:56          It's fun traveling and meeting New People. I like attention. Yeah, I get it. I get a lot of that now. Bella Bella backpack kit. Here you are. No one's going on. Yeah, the people around me have definitely changed. They all want to be my friend now or is that weird? It's not my problem. It's their problem, not mine. There's still a lot of hair on my forehead. He was really good. This one, it was really good. Can we take the Chili off regularly? I'll take a root beer float. You feel like you've changed through this process? Not really. I still act the same way. How, how I usually like act before all this happened,

Speaker 3:          03:52          we're all star just posted me teaching Deontay wilder how to floss. Like if the backpack gets fell off at the most liked comment right now. Coordination skills, not on point. Same Old, same old check my story. Oh my God, it's insane. Hey people that just try to advertise themselves on my page overall. Yes, I do think social media is a good thing because it's a way for people to keep social. Oh yeah, there's definitely cyber bullying. So I read my comments all the time and really a main one. No care. I run it back one more time. We have the same to drip on boat coming soon. Yes. I'm dropping a project this year. You African, uh, hopefully pop off my music career. I tried to have my own style. Like you don't want to anybody else's rob flow like any old school rappers. Um, like I know of Tupac and Biggie. I don't really listen to them though, but I do respect that. Like they are legends. We are off to Steve. I label to see what's up with a single that we're trying to drive with them.

Speaker 1:          05:22          So I remember in these meetings like when we talked about the kid stuff that we talked about like four or how about you do? I'm a talker and I'm the face of the operation. Hello. Nice to meet you too. In my opinion is not really anything hard about it. I guess just like hard work and a few days of little sleep, but that's just like work. You work a lot though. Yeah, for a 16 year old, but it's fun work. Do you ever feel tired? Feeling tired is boring?

Speaker 3:          06:12          I can just imagine doing a new segment right here. Hey guys, my name is bag pack kit and welcome to backpack kid news and weather and today's recent stories, backpack is dropped. Paid any fee this year.

Speaker 1:          06:30          Amazing backdrop.

Speaker 2:          06:35          This is a nice view.

Speaker 3:          06:38          If you think of backpack kid, you think of a guy who created a floss and does silly dances on his Instagram. But I'm trying to get credibility as a rapper because being a rapper it looks like a lot of fun and I want to use that opportunity to do good in the world.

Speaker 2:          06:56          Right. There's a huge truck coming your way.

Speaker 3:          07:00          It's definitely a good experience for a 16 year old then. Not a lot of them experienced. Like I know that most teenagers don't go through the life that I go through, but I feel like that this life that I live is normal. So normal. It's not normal. No, I wouldn't say it's normal. It's normal to me. Yeah. But it's not normal to everybody else. I'm in 11th grade, so I have this year to finish and the next year and then I'm done with high school and then I have my whole life ahead of me to do whatever I need to do actually. And my friends might go to college, so I don't know what I'm going to do about that. So it's pretty unlikely at this at this moment, because I already have a career. I just gotta stay poppy to not need to college. If I do need colleagues, that means that like I've completely fallen off and I'm not making any more money, I would have died.

Speaker 1:          08:14          Right. Okay. Yeah, that was Frederick and Jayden and Jordan. My friends and family, they're definitely important for keeping me sane through this whole process. They just treated me the same way. They said nothing in particular. I liked that though.

Speaker 3:          08:44          I like attention. I was always the class clown and the good ole elementary, middle school days. Love being loud and making a scene.

Speaker 2:          08:54          Yes.

Speaker 3:          08:56          Look both ways.

Speaker 2:          08:58          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          09:05          For the rest of the tonight I'm going to see the premiere or wreck it. Ralph breaks the Internet in the background. Yeah. I'm trying to get into fanny packs.

Speaker 2:          09:18          So these are all the people that have broken the Internet.

Speaker 3:          09:24          I've seen his name's Skye. Me or I saw the video with, um, what's the name again? Jantek. Okay, so the video would Deontay wilder, 97 k views and then stories, 16 k views, 11 k views, 10 k you think eight views and yeah, that's it.

Speaker 1:          09:48          Where do you get your sense of competence? Um,

Speaker 2:          09:56          okay.

Speaker 1:          09:57          I guess this, this is how I am, like my persona is myself, so I got to do with the myself. Don't pay attention when everybody thinks of you and just do you.

Speaker 2:          10:11          That's the best way to do it.

Speaker 3:          10:19          No problem.

Speaker 2:          10:20          Oh,

Speaker 1:          10:22          do you feel like you've achieved your dream? And I have my whole life ahead of me to achieve even Lord.

Speaker 2:          10:30          Okay.

Speaker 3:          10:31          Hey, I was good backpack. Katie here. Big things that you believe Ravena a in the life of a backpack kid, but I got to catch his movie premiere. Bye.
