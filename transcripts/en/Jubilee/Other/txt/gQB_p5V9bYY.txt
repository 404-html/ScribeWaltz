Speaker 1:          00:00          Hey guys, what's up? My name is Peter Sudara, so my name is Yoshi, Sodexo, and today we're going to be playing some candid confession.

Speaker 1:          00:15          Yoshi. Hi. Peter's miss. Meet you. Meet you face like, oh, is this not the dating one dose and stuff like that? Man, we already had going on. What is your relationship to each other? We're brothers. Yes, and I'm a better one. The better one. I've known him all his life. He hasn't known me all my life though. I've known him all my life, so technically you haven't known me all your life. Oh, me and Yoshi are pretty open book. We know each other very well or so. We think we're still, we think so. I'm kind of scared saying that we're going to go. Never have I ever hit on one of your female friends?

Speaker 2:          01:03          Three, two, one? Nope. Nope. Oh yeah. Well I,

Speaker 1:          01:08          I know you have. Every time I tell him, I was like, hey, I liked this girl. Wait, no, you know that's true. That's true. Your first girlfriend, who wasn't going that I told him that he thought she was cute. I didn't know you were going for her work. You? I don't know. I don't know. Thanks. You never have I ever blamed something I did on you. Ready? Three, two, one. We do this all the time. I feel like our dynamic and brothers is almost as twins. Like you do something bad, you blame it on me. I do something bad. I blame it on you. And then eventually we realize we should just keep it to ourselves because I know another one of us gets in trouble. You know it. I made us a lot closer as friends. It's not like that's happened in the recent years, not as TMI love you like, okay. As a child, as a child, like maybe like three or four. I remember peeing on the floor on accident, like I couldn't hold it and I was so scared of getting in trouble and I blame that on your sheet because obviously as a child you don't think about that stuff. You're just like, oh my pants are wet. But he's right there. So that could be him like you don't know.

Speaker 1:          02:32          I know. Oh my God, we were such dumb kids who saying we, hold on, I didn't do that. I can't actually remember what I've done. Use a big brain farts on me. Oh yeah, totally. Yeah. That's like, I guess kids are easy. Never have I ever cried in front of you.

Speaker 2:          02:53          Oh, three, two, one all the time. We're emotional crybaby.

Speaker 1:          03:00          Both of us tears everywhere. I mean, watching movies, watching movies up. You weren't like in all the floor. Very sensitive dudes like we have. We talk about our feelings a lot. So a lot of times we'll argue and get to a point of even tears. Tears. Yeah. They were arguing and yeah. Never have I ever been jealous because of a girl you've been with.

Speaker 2:          03:25          All right. Three, two, one. No, no.

Speaker 1:          03:30          Yeah. Somebody, it's like off, off limits. I can't even look at that person. It's weird. Like even that's also why I went like the girls in the friends thing. I mean, obviously it didn't matter to you. So, uh, and just kidding. You know, I, you know, I actually had no idea. Right. I don't realize it until I was older and I was like, Hey, I was just totally harmonious that you guys would have been so bad again. Oh my gosh, yes. Holy Crap. Thank you for saving me from that. Yes or no. Sometimes I question, I dunno. Sometimes I question if what I'm doing has any meaning or value.

Speaker 2:          04:07          Okay. Uh, yeah, three, two, one definitely.

Speaker 1:          04:13          Can I do that because partially, no. Absolutely. So that's a, that's a yes. Okay. Then I'll just take your head like, okay. Even if you thought about it a little bit, but if you don't question it, then how do you know if all you're doing is the right thing? Right. I agree. I think if you're, if you're questioning it and you're still doing it, that's why it went nowhere. The rest, but the same time. Because at first I was like, yes. Sometimes I think about that, but then I always come to the conclusion of like, of course, yeah, there's, there's meaningful it. That's why I do it because at the end of the day you got to realize that like what you're doing can make a difference. And as long as it makes a difference in one person's life, dude. Yeah. Done. And if you're not looking at it in that way, why are you doing it? Fame. Money. You're right. I guess never have I ever felt jealous of your accomplishments.

Speaker 2:          04:57          All right. Okay. Three, two, one.

Speaker 1:          05:01          I mean, let's be honest, it's like when you first got power rangers and I auditioned hard for it. Like with Donald Trump, jr knew how hard I was working for that. So I told you that though. That's, I think that's the main thing with us. Like both of us have spoken to each other. Like if I'm feeling jealous about it, I'll let you know. You've known when I've been jealous of stuff to like social media, social media. Yeah. Yours was definitely way more at the top. At the beginning I was very like, dude, I am nothing right now. I'm a nobody. I was so used to it buddy growing up. Oh you're Yoshi is a little brother. And then it became, I'm Peter's brother and I was like, what is going on? And I was like, I can't, I can't ask him for help because I want to just do my own social media.

Speaker 1:          05:39          But then when I was like, you know, I was like, I'm just going to ask. I'm like, hey man, like what do I do with this whole thing? And you were like, here, put this, try this on with this. And I'm like, oh yeah, that's cool. I would never think to put those two things together. And now my social media is good and it's because of me asking for your help. Before I was like, no, he's not going to help me. He's, he wants this for him. I put it in my head that he wants to be the guy who's like, oh, oh, you're, you're Peter's brother. I put that on him. I do. We never want to call him Peter's brother. Just kidding. Go happens again, please let me know. Absolutely. That's what we do now. You know? Oh man, you mean versus the world, right. It's ups and down. Of course it is. I shut up. Never have I ever told you why I love you.

Speaker 3:          06:29          Okay.

Speaker 1:          06:34          Three, two, one. I don't really have, I think maybe if anything it's, it would be more red for me. I don't know. I don't know. I don't think we have ever really talked about that. We just kind of like new cause I mean it's all this stuff that we talk about, all of this, you know, we're always supporting each other. We're trying to pull each other even when it gets down bad. Yeah. It's like you're mad at me because you love me and can see me do better. You're an amazing big brother. I know. Yeah. No, you really are. You really are you? I, I can't, I am so blessed. It sounds like the most basic compliment. I can't sit in there the way you're one of the most genuine dudes I've ever met. I am not that good of a dude to you. I feel like I screwed up with you a lot and yet you still look up to me and that's a big reason why I love you.

Speaker 1:          07:29          You have been the one that pushed me to become the way that I am. It's funny. I mean, I got that from you. I think you did. I didn't do that. And you say all this stuff about me and my action, whatever, but me getting Cota, was you seeing something in that character that I could do? And also yourself. Sure. You just put an image in my head and that was it. It wasn't like it will be a director and that's what I believe you can. And, and, and I'm ready to be by your side when that happens. Thanks for being good friend and brother. Ah, I got you. No, I don't want to do this again. No. Oh, hi jubilee fam. I'm Ian. I'm Taylor. Thanks so much for watching guys.
