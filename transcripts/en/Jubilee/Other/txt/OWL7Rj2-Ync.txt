Speaker 1:          00:56          Yes, I work out of here a lot. The great company. They're like a culture hub. I usually, my mind is, my forte of course is the studio. Where are we going to be there? So no life though. So many events here. This is the studio,

Speaker 3:          01:10          so,

Speaker 1:          01:16          so I don't know anything about this set up. What would be the first thing that you do with it? This is like off the top of my head, I will more so as like if there's a certain song that touches you that you would be able to sing and then we can like record it. And then I can just drop it in or should it be something original? What do you think that should be? Our starting point, Austin is to get comfortable. Okay. Knock that out and van from there know.

Speaker 4:          01:49          Ooh. Okay. No. Oh, oh, oh

Speaker 5:          02:14          okay.

Speaker 4:          02:16          Hello.

Speaker 6:          02:24          Cool. What?

Speaker 1:          02:37          Thank you. That was incredible. So now that we got that right, what I did was take your vocals, chopped it up. I got it in here, right?

Speaker 6:          02:53          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:54          I can also down pitch it. Ooh,

Speaker 2:          02:59          that's really cool.

Speaker 1:          03:01          So now,

Speaker 3:          03:11          okay,

Speaker 2:          03:11          ah, ah, try when have the regular but regular.

Speaker 1:          03:39          Hey man, listen to pro gets a cold pro coproduction oh is that, is that how people get it? One suggestion in the middle of doing it. If you're like, Yo, when we just do this and maybe flip it like this. You know what I'm saying? Cause I'm in a certain zone. But you probably here because you're on outside looking in. Okay. So you know

Speaker 1:          04:02          for me there's so much about the person that has to be, I guess no, you know, or discovered to even be able to create something. Yeah. It's crazy cause I'm like one of my brothers just recently passed this past October, so I'm going to stay like you do. I deal with him all the way, but at the same time I know for sure Halan want me to sit here and soak all freaking day. I think I've cried out as much as I can cry. So now it's more so like just utilizing his energy to just kind of push forward and become who I need to be in his life. My hat is off to you though because that's not, that's not easy cause I mean my dad passed away and I was 22 I mean I stopped singing for about, I mean not very long but probably for about a good six to seven months and I couldn't do anything. So I mean if you can, yeah, I mean it's hard. Don't get me wrong. Do you want to, you want us to like a song that we're doing today? Do you want something to be about him? We can. I should. I don't know. I didn't have any prerequisites of what is going on. I'm just like, whatever vibes happen, it happened. Like

Speaker 3:          05:32          no pain.

Speaker 7:          05:35          I hear you.

Speaker 8:          05:39          Eh?

Speaker 1:          05:43          Okay.

Speaker 7:          05:43          Deep with him still.

Speaker 8:          05:47          Hey,

Speaker 2:          05:54          what did I say?

Speaker 7:          06:13          Okay.

Speaker 1:          06:16          We're all talking about experiences that we've had in our lives. Sky recently lost his brother. I've lost my dad. I am a musician because of my dad. Maybe that's why I sing so much. Maybe that's why I'm so invested. Just a being able to, to share how we deal with those losses, that comradery Barton advise to when we got to create it. Just kind of it. It clicked. I mean, sure. You want to hear? Yes, right. Let's do this. Ready?

Speaker 7:          07:00          Hi. I need you close to. Oh, hope. Oh.
