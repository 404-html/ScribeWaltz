Speaker 1:          00:23          Other people are like, oh, he's like fine, if you don't show symptoms and no one will know if you don't want to talk about it, no one will know and it'll be hidden. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:59          The good days. Other days for like I'm able to wake up, I like a reasonable time and like after waking up, like actually get out of bed and stay out of bed and like go for a run and do the things that a normal human being like can do.

Speaker 1:          01:20          Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:21          Bad days are when I get up late and I say okay I need to get out of the bed. And then they don't for like an hour and then they get out of bed and then I get back in bed cause I just like feel like I can't do anything. Today is August 7th so it is, we are coming up on so nine months. Yeah. So, oh yeah. Nine months. It has been nine months. Like I told mom and dad that my life was falling apart when he was little. He met, he was a pretty happy child.

Speaker 1:          02:28          MMM.

Speaker 2:          02:29          As a parent, I wanted to build a cocoon. I want to protect my child from all the bad things in the world. There's only so many things you can control. Um, so the whole process of letting go,

Speaker 1:          02:48          that's hard.

Speaker 2:          02:52          I think after being so quiet, I can elementary school and a lot of high school, I felt like I had something to prove and they always want us to prove my worth like through school.

Speaker 1:          03:06          Okay.

Speaker 2:          03:09          What happened was I was like kind of on the cusp of like a depressive episode in near the beginning of my fall semester, stop going to classes, start sleeping in too late, causing like a three month on depressive episode.

Speaker 3:          03:27          I remember Matthew Calling said, I'm sorry I didn't tell you this sooner and I'm having real problems with anxiety and depression. And I remember wanting to just somehow reach out to my him a hug.

Speaker 1:          03:58          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          03:58          you're worthless. How could you hurt this person? How could you let yourself get in this place, Mike? The answer is constantly just like, I don't know. I don't know either. No, no, no. I get it must be because I'm an awful person. He didn't tell me about um, yeah, hurting himself

Speaker 4:          04:22          directly. Um, and that's, I think that's the scariest part. Matthew's depression that I am actually a free to know all the details.

Speaker 1:          04:37          Oh,

Speaker 4:          04:42          I had such intense feelings of frustration and confusion and fear and anger and then you get to vent them somewhere and I invented them at myself.

Speaker 2:          04:56          I didn't withdraw from classes until the day before finals started, which was the last day you could withdraw from class.

Speaker 1:          05:04          MMM.

Speaker 2:          05:07          There was, there was so much pride involved with going to rice and um, being a stray procedures university and like being premed, they're graduating in four years and I had to like give all of them up for the sake of my studio for my health.

Speaker 3:          05:41          Depression is an illness hidden from view and silent in so many ways. People don't want to talk about it, but it's significant part of our population that you can treat and deal with. It's not the yes. Yes. If you will ask me like what didn't you like? What did you do when you took time off from like I found out how to be a normal human being. Again, I forgot how to take care of myself because I didn't care about myself but definitely something I can say is I was able to call and called refocus my life. My morning routine. There is so much triumph like I know I'm just like brushing my teeth is like very mundane but like on the inside I'm just like fucking, yeah, I rest my team. Being able to just like do all of these things and like know that I'm, I'm ready also to tackle whatever else comes down already. Like kids. It's so encouraging. I'm really proud of how we deal with the hard time set shorter characters. He's gone through some hard times.

Speaker 3:          07:40          You will still have days where like nothing will change. You'll have days where you only thing regress and feel worse by, despite that, I understand that that doesn't define me and it doesn't define what they can and can't do. And just focusing, just, just focusing on that next step is how before it, regardless of your religious beliefs, your, your, your personal ideologies, love yourself. So in terms of like where I am and my road to recovery, like I'm still, I'm still just getting up. I'm still just like sagging to walk, but like, I'm still walking.
