Speaker 1:          00:00          Never have I ever checked you out

Speaker 2:          00:03          while you were changing. You checked me out though, did it?

Speaker 1:          00:19          I haven't seen you in ages. Oh No. It's just been like 10 minutes. My name is Jonathan. I am 25 my name is Maddie. I'm 28 seven. I what? That was all hard. I've actually known him before he was born, but we didn't really hang out up until like he moved in. I think so. Yeah. You go first here. Let's do it. It never have I ever made you clean up my mess.

Speaker 2:          00:52          Three, two, one.

Speaker 1:          00:57          That time when I got really sick. Oh, I never seen come from anyone lives. It was like you were like, you were being exercise. It was just like how like, like you are this really gross, but I really appreciate it. You guys for that though. I love you man. So I do the same. I think for me, uh, it's definitely the dishes, dude. I do my dishes all the time, but sometimes you get lazy.

Speaker 2:          01:26          Yeah, yeah, for sure.

Speaker 1:          01:30          Never have I ever hit on your friends, Yo, man, you bring the girls all the time. When we're supposed to do I just want to sit there and be quiet now. I wouldn't be able to. Oh, I haven't. Mainly because I haven't really met a lot of like you don't bring friends that are on the light. Right. Cause I figured you guys would hit on him. So honestly I'm not surprised though. Like I give it to me, give it to me. Never have I ever pretended not to be home. So you wouldn't talk to me.

Speaker 2:          02:09          Wait, really? I mean like

Speaker 1:          02:15          you guys are family to me. You know I was, I grew up an only child. So being able to have a roommate or a group of roommates that are like that are like family to me. Like that's dope. God, thanks for making me feel like now I don't go to like extremes in pretending like I don't go into the closet and close off the lines of hope. Like, oh I hope they don't notice I don't do that. But now there's times when you know, you just want to be just like, man, I feel like I'd be not a good person to talk to you right now. So I stay away no matter what. Like if you guys wanted to talk to me, even if it feels like it, should they? Yeah. I mean I feel the same. I'm still all ears.

Speaker 2:          02:52          Yeah. Damn

Speaker 1:          02:55          bond they're not is man. Let's do it. We're going deep now. Never have I ever checked you out while you were changing. You checked me out though. Did like we're an apartment of guys like, yeah. How thins check your arms and your hands. Want to see it. Some progress, the gym and all that steak objectively, I feel we're all good looking people in the apartment, so like you're trying to see if another bonding moment. It's a bonding moment and then let's just say we know each other too well.

Speaker 2:          03:38          Okay.

Speaker 1:          03:38          Never have I ever lied to you.

Speaker 1:          03:49          I was like, boy, you got to lie right here, Huh? Yes. Yes. Someone's, you've lied to everyone at some point in life like you're talking about like white lies. Yeah, exactly. Okay. Okay. Then let me ask you, what's the biggest lie you've ever told me then

Speaker 2:          04:08          I was okay.

Speaker 1:          04:10          Oh, you asked me about my mental health. Gotcha. Yeah. Cause I guess at the point I was just trying to be like I was, I just wanted to get through stuff on my own aggression. That's understood. I didn't want it to, I didn't want to trouble you guys, which I guess is stupid in mice. Right. Cause I don't have real trouble when you're even when you knew.

Speaker 2:          04:29          Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1:          04:33          I definitely lied to you for sure. Yeah. You know, white lies and all that stuff. And the same thing when you guys asked me how I'm doing whatever. Sometimes I lie because I don't want to get into it or whatever. Um, I mean for you, I'm glad that we were able to like eventually like I was able to eventually get past that and able to, I guess truly open up. Yeah. Never have I ever been jealous of you. Three, two, one. All right. [inaudible] all these chips that jut Pam module. Okay. Why are you jealous of that? Because you want to go right? I'll go next time. We're going next time. All right. I'm just like, I'm sure we're eventually going to put you in a suitcase. You don't have enough money. I guess it's my turn. Huh? What are you doing? Why the fuck are you so good looking dude, I'm sorry. I'm not doing, I think you're, you're a smart guy and a all that stuff. So when you do work on like, you know, you probably do this stuff. I was like, man, I admire then, but yeah. Cool. I'll take you on next week. Let's do it. Let's do it. Let's see what's happening. Never have I ever been ashamed to tell you something.

Speaker 1:          06:09          Three, two, one. You remember that time when I had broken up with my ex? Yeah. Yeah Dude. I was definitely a shame to tell you guys that I was still hanging out with her. Um, and it was like selective, you know, it was like I would only come to you because um, those are things I could tell you. Yeah. I mean I get, that's why like I was always there for you whenever you wanted to talk. You were, yeah. I'm glad that you feel comfortable coming to me, us, that stuff kind of is my team. It is your turn. Trying to drag it out. Shaved things I've been ashamed of. I guess it would be like when I had that in my shame to tell us that no one's ever really proud of when they're not in a good mental spot. Right. I knew I could come to you guys and with that kind of stuff, but it's still, it's still something you're kind of ashamed of.

Speaker 1:          07:18          Nah, man, you shouldn't feel ashamed, man. That's what we're here for. Yeah. Like I said, yeah. Like I, like I said to Peter, man, it's what would I do without you exactly what I mean. And, and I hope you can say the same thing to you know, is now, it really is like you brought up on a really great point where it's just like all those times where, where would I be if you were gone and stuff like that. Or if any of my roommates, yeah. Dude, I tell you like we're pretty lucky in that sense. All right. To have such a big support group. Yeah, yeah, no, definitely. Yeah. That's alright. That's alright dude. Never have I ever cried at the house. Three, two, one. We've all cried from joy from a lot of laughing. A lot of, Oh, a lot of laughing. A lot of emotions. That too loud, heavy emotions, man. We're emotional people. Yeah. I feel like this like period of my life has really changed who I am as a person. This is a very pivotal moment is to 10.
