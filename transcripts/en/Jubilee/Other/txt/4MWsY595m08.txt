Speaker 1:          00:02          First violent to me if I was interested for me. And so when we have in stealing, killing cops, everything, drugs taken jubilee project to the next level for the stores, we still believe that doing good is contagious. It's still hard.

Speaker 2:          00:38          So have the portable son has always been, I grew up listening to the story at church, but it never really hit me until I started making this film.

Speaker 3:          00:50          How do the sun is such a profound story? Something that I could really relate with is probably one of the most intimate passages of scripture in all the Bible. And what you have is a son who is pretty arrogant and he says, give me my inheritance or giving me what I, what I deserve. And so when he said that in a minute needed Mideastern culture, he was basically saying, I wish you were dead. So just give me the money problem, challenge Shane and his father around and trying to make his own way to still know his dad's money. And what's crazy is the father gave him be heretics. Knowing Kali, that the sandwich squander all the Laos and in the Senate of course goes off and there's this crazy life, this takes waste. All the money just really lives in the world and ends up finding that it's a pretty cool place.

Speaker 4:          01:51          The turning point in the film is when the sun reaches this utter sense of hopelessness when he's got nothing left, spent all the money and there's nothing in this world that satisfies and it's when he's in this deep sense of pain that he starts to let go of this need for what the world tells him to have. And so this is then part where he knows that he has to make a change for the better or a better life, a different life, and leave the one that he's been doing. Huh?

Speaker 3:          02:27          And he said it'd be better if he goes back home and he goes back home broken. So you see him totally open and obedient to his father. But what was cool was this, the father saw his son from a fire and I love the picture of this like Mid Eastern Asian type of dad running towards the Sun. And then it says he embraces him and he kisses him. And this is the most powerful verse to me. Like we're kissing is used over and over again, or it's in the iterative sense. So it's like he kissed him over and over and over and over. It's showing this blessing, this grace

Speaker 4:          03:05          3.1.

Speaker 3:          03:07          This is one where I really was able to connect to the character after the part of the son's story is like, you know, one of the most popular stories, average. A lot of people can relate to it and we've all been there. I've been in the sun and the farm, I can relate to the room and just having neck stage of rebellion and he's not like realizing how much their parents love them and always wanting something else. And then finding out that that somebody else is not good, not good. Anyways,

Speaker 5:          03:38          my parents divorced when I was a teenager, when I was about 15 and it was a result and under fair my dad had. And I hate it. My Dad, in fact, I didn't want to talk to him and I didn't for a long time. And, uh, so I, I kind of spiraled out of control where I just partied and I did my own thing. So, you know, fast forward some, I still had problems with my dad. You know, I'd give my life to God. It's supposed to be like this now Christian Guy that really loves God. But I had this like hatred from my father. I couldn't, I this judgement against him even though myself, I'd done crazy stupid thing. I couldn't see that. I just saw his sin. And so that dominated me until one night I was walking across the campus as a college student and I thought, I heard a voice saying, you need to love your father. And I said, uh, I don't think I can because I have no feelings for him. And I felt God say, you think my son's felt like going to the cross. Then I got it. I said, love is not about a feeling. Love is about commitment. It's not about me liking a person necessarily. It's about me committing myself to one.

Speaker 4:          05:08          It took me about a year and a half to make this film and I kind of wrote it, um, when I was a very different person than I am today. I think the main difference between then and now was that I started to understand what it means to receive grace. Throughout my whole life, I've always, I've always lived on there, this belief that the harder I worked and why I'm able to achieve, and then the more happy I'm able to become. And so I worked hard. I went to great college at Harvard University. I achieved my American dream of working at the White House. I was living a very comfortable life and yet there was still something empty about this whole thing. No matter how hard I tried to put up this front, to put up this image that everything was all that together. Deep down inside I realized I still felt like life was still very meanings to me.

Speaker 4:          06:00          And no matter how much harder I work, the harder I tried. There was still this very strong void in my life. I felt so depressed. I felt so exhausted and I hit the rock bottom of my life and there was one night where I just felt completely all the simpler where I thought about taking my own life. During that season of depression, I was diagnosed with a disease called hepatitis B, and when I first found out about it, um, I was in utter shock. I felt so paralyzed by this point, with this understanding that this realization that the greats Eddie lead, the great person that I thought I was wasn't really as great as I really was. And it was in that moment of revelation that I started to see that my life was only so temporary. I am weak then I am broken. I am full of sin. That there was nothing in me that inherently maybe deserves and slot. Wait, you gave it to me anyways. It was only in this moment of weakness did I start to finally understand what the power of the father's love really means to us. It's the most powerful expression of love that you can ever experience and action you. Dave,

Speaker 3:          07:29          I really believe that this story, look 15 isn't really adopt the sun. It's really all about the fog. It's about how loving and gracious he was to this rebellious time.

Speaker 6:          07:41          Interesting thing about the story is that, you know, we focus on son's journey. Let me see his suffering. You see the fact that she becomes homeless and this is office money. But what we don't is that this father is also suffering. That's from,

Speaker 7:          07:55          of course, he's a loving father and it tears him up inside just watching his son destroy himself.

Speaker 6:          08:02          The reason why the father's paying assault salt pork sun only realizes the father's love, the father's name, what a father can give for his son in order to teach him the life lesson. We don't realize it until later on, but you know, the whole life journey is to, to find ourselves through our hardships. I made a lot of mistakes in life and uh, it's good to know that no matter, no matter how many mistakes you made, there's always somebody who willing to still accept you. Forgive him. I'm lucky enough to happen. Given the second chance to know what makes a story so powerful is the reality that at the end of the day, the sun never really did spot, but the father chose to die for his son because his love for him was really unconditional. It's the expression of love. It's an expression of selflessness or selfless, seemingly foolish, so many truly radical, truly life changing. And what we hope that people will take away from this film is this idea that that love is still today and that will be able to experience that love even just cuts a piece of that love. Your lights will be so much.

Speaker 1:          09:37          Yeah, I know how to take care of babies. No, we'd have to make a cameo in there. We do videos. You've got to look at the prodigal to bleed project.
