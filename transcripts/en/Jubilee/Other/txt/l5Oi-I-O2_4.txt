Speaker 2:          00:07          yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:11          a viral New York Times article featured 36 questions that could supposedly make any two people fall in love. We want it to see what would happen if we ask these questions to two complete strangers on a blind date.

Speaker 1:          00:23          My name is Victoria. I'm from Pennsylvania and I'm very single. My last relationship was like three years ago. I've been single for a long time. My name is Claudio Peroni Jr. I'm from Glendale, California, and I am shingle. The worst end to this would probably be her coming in and quickly leaving.

Speaker 2:          00:50          Yes. No, maybe during, probably during.

Speaker 1:          01:00          Hello? Welcome to my den Victoria. Claudio, I say, Oh yes. Nice to meet you. [inaudible] t four two. I'm really nervous. Yeah. Yeah. I never had a blind date before. It's true. This is the first time. Yeah, we're done. Good. What'd you like to open? Yeah, I'll read the first question. Okay. What is a physical attribute you secretly or not so secretly like the most about yourself? It's your hair, isn't it? No, I think my eyes, what color is it? Can Be Gray right now. The term grades sometimes. Is it like a mood ring? Yes. There's different shades of gray. I think you're kind of like a Blueish blueish right now. Yeah. Was Great. You're in love. Is that what it means? Um, for me, I like my tattoos, but is that, does that count? Yeah. They're not like it's on you. If it's part of the now.

Speaker 1:          01:53          Yeah. I tattooed this one myself. Hand shut them. No, I did me really hard. No, I liked this one a lot because it's pretty recent. What does that exists? Which means Jesus Christ, son of God, Savior. Okay. That's probably, I guess one of my most meaningful ones. Yeah, that would've been a really, but I can see that you're like shy about it. I know people, people are kind of judge you sometimes about that. Oh yeah. But I think the fact he put it on your body, it's like it's in the right in the middle, right? Don't read Greek. Yeah. What'd you like to be famous and in what way? Yes. In what way? For my personality. Your personality and also for rap. Awesome. You think about that? Don't be shy about that. I'm not shy about it. Okay, good. She has like, some people are like, no, I'm a musician as well. So do I play guitar on the songs to sing? Got some stuff on Spotify. Oh yeah. Yeah. I don't even have my own music downloaded is open. I'm going to close my eyes because I don't want to see reaction.

Speaker 2:          03:09          Boy,

Speaker 1:          03:14          that's awesome. You are really good boys. Thank you. So you can sing. Thank you. Yeah, you should be recognized for that. Take one minute and tell your partner your life story in as much detail as possible. Do we have like a timeline but stuff like watches. So tell me when the clock starts. Okay. Uh, my father is Italian immigrant. Uh, I played baseball my entire life till I was like 16, 17 years old. Then I discovered that I had a love for theater, so I chose to do theater instead. I went to college for theater, left college, worked a bunch of bullshit jobs, rediscovered my love for music, started the music more seriously, and now I'm here. I guess it's not as hard as it sounds. Okay. Yeah. It's really hard for me because like I have a bad memory. So I was raised on a farm, uh, like Ron, a lot Amish people, and I was really bad at school, so I went through a bunch of different school systems, but in the end I was like cyber schooled.

Speaker 1:          04:06          I moved out as 18 and I was a nanny for like three weeks and I got fired and then I moved to Indiana and started a band. We toured around the whole country for a few years that like broke up and then he went to Ireland. Then I moved to here and then I did youtube and now doing youtube as my career. Wow. That's awesome. Yeah. What kind of stuff was there, Ben? What's not? Talk about that. I'm going to look them up. Okay. Well, I'm not going to tell it to you. If you knew that in one year you would die suddenly. Jesus Christ. This is very dark. Would you change anything about the way you are living? Right. That's, it's so like you don't know until you're there until you get, if I knew for certain I was going to die in a year, I'll get a bunch of credit cards and I would just like, I just do like everything fun.

Speaker 1:          04:54          I feel like I'd like sell everything, take my dog and like live in a mountain. They just live in a mountain. You're living in a mountain by yourself. Yeah, with my dog. You just like be alone for an entire year. Yeah, and the die will you spend a year getting close to people. Then you die and then new people. Then all of a sudden you die and they're like, oh, that guy was cool and then they wrote songs and memories of you and stuff like that. Yeah. I would imagine as long as they can write about how their friend got lost in the mountains and they never saw him again. I think it'd be cooler if they need better. I've got you can, you can have that answer. No, you're fine. That's the wrong answer.

Speaker 1:          05:30          What is true love? What is true love? I know what it is. We know what it is cause I just think that it's accepting someone no matter what you choose to love them. That's like the choice. It's a choice that you've made. So this is something I struggle with because I had to deal with people we're talking about like soul mates. I saw thing. I get, that's beautiful. All right, that's, that's beautiful. That idea is beautiful, right? Like you stumble across someone who the universe decided you have to be with. Why isn't it more beautiful? No, it's for shoes. His shoes and like who you spend your life with. So like that's like the beauty in it. It's like the work. The ground. Yeah. Do you have a secret hunch about how you will die? I don't want to die. Like I almost slipped in the bathtub and dying. It's not cold like the lane I choke on something. Right?

Speaker 1:          06:18          Not to go to, but for a while I thought it was gonna be suicide. Why? Why did I think it should be suicide? Yeah. Just deeply depressed for a very long time. How did you, like, how do you, how do you do with that? I don't like medication, meaning like when I can't create, like when I'm not able to do things it gets really bad. So I was auditioning and stuff after I left college and then it wasn't really getting anything. So I just felt like scum, like I walked away, I had a full ride and I walked away from that to like go do it. And then I wasn't doing it just felt like shit I have to work out everyday because I get like anxiety. Yup. Like I have to work out. That's what's helped me the most too. Yeah. Share personal problem.

Speaker 1:          07:06          Ask Your partners advice on how he or she might handle it. I already know by problem that cause I don't know what the fuck to say. Ask me what's bothering you? What's the problem? Well, I like, I've kind of talked about it in passing here, but I'm really bad with um, relationships and I think I go for the wrong people. Like I haven't had a relationship for like a while, like know like three years and I've only had one. I don't know if it's a Los Angeles thing, but no one really wants to be in a relationship with me. Why do you think that is? Isn't this it's personal? Well, first you have to know that that's not a new thing. I don't know. It's not. It never is. That's what they all say yet. What is the expectation in anything bringing life, it will lead to disappointment at some point or another.

Speaker 1:          07:48          So if you just go into things with an open mind going, I don't know what the fuck's going to happen, but either way I'll make it work and be fine. When you think about it, it kind of bugs you a little bit. I don't think it like consciously like, no, it's kind of just like a little game that I can't figure out how to play. Right. That's the classic line written lovers. Again, we're like dating's a game. Loves, loves the choice. They circled back and all of this full circle. This is the last one to read together.

Speaker 1:          08:16          We're both going to have to answer it. That's both were at the same time. I know what it's going to say. The risk of being wrong. What'd you go on a second date with? It was getting worse. Case scenario thing. Yeah. Oh, what was your worst case scenario that you enter and then quickly, oh, that wouldn't have happened. Well, no, I know that I would say, yeah, I want to hear more. I want to like talk more about that. We should work out, go to Glendale or I'll go to downtown or on my phone that you made me play music off of skipping. Hey
