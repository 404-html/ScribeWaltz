Speaker 1:          00:00          Hey guys, let's meet Jason here with the Jubilee Project. Hope you guys are all doing well. This is not the video actually for the five K as we haven't run it yet. We're going to be running on Saturday, which is luck. Uh, but the reason for this video is actually to put a date on your calendar. And that day is April 8th, 2010 April 8th is a day without shoes sponsored by toms shoes. And the idea is that they want to get people around the world to spend a day without shoes. Like this can be your entire day, this can be a portion of your day, um, whatever. But the reason is to grow awareness for the millions of children throughout developing countries who grow up without shoes. And apparently this causes a lot of serious problems for them growing up. So I thought that I would be participating. I would love for you to join me and the millions or I'm not sure at the thousands of people around the world who are participating as well.

Speaker 1:          00:53          Uh, there's more information at this link at this video, but please, please, please, uh, send me a comment. Send me a message if you'd like to participate, and we'll make a nice little video as well. And we'll post it up for the jubilee project. But think about it. The Thursday, April 8th, I'm going to be spending my day without shoes at New York. Uh, I'm not sure if I can do that yet in the office, but I'm gonna figure that out. But the rest of the day, if not, at least in the office, will be spent without shoes and a, if you do it too, maybe you can make a nice little compilation video, but please let me know if you're interested. It should be a great time. Take care guys.
