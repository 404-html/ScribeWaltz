Speaker 1:          00:00          Never have I ever thought about having kids with you. All of this is where we're going. Um, Gosh. I wish we had time.

Speaker 2:          00:18          Wayne living and Amber Dylan. And how long have you been together? A year and a half. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:28          Breath.

Speaker 3:          00:31          Can I go first? No, I never have. I ever pretended I was sleeping so you wouldn't bother me.

Speaker 1:          00:40          Wait, how many times? I've tried to think three. Ooh, you've ever done that before? One? Of course. You really surprised about that. Come on. Hey, I'm tired. One for an hour, I'm going to sleep. Oh Wow. You're surprised about that. I never knew that

Speaker 3:          01:04          I here. Thank you. Thank you. Wait. Okay. Ready? Never have I ever wished that I had been raised

Speaker 1:          01:13          differently. Three, two, one. Yeah, of course.

Speaker 3:          01:20          Yeah, always. But then, and then had we, we wouldn't be here right now. Not Right. But it definitely makes me think as a child and looking back on your past and have those moments, like what if, what if, and I think most of us do, right? Yeah. What if I had two parents? What if my dad hadn't died? And what if my mom hadn't been cold and hard and unhappy? What is my thought? I had my father in my life. What if my mother was in my life and my grandparents didn't raise me? What if I didn't choose this path? And I chose that. We were just talking to my brother about that today. So I'm happy for how your lifeline so that we can be together.

Speaker 1:          02:02          Hmm.

Speaker 3:          02:04          Never have I ever done something to fit in? Three, two, one. Ah, we're not coming. Not Right. Not Lately, but for a long time. Yeah. No. Well, listen, if I cared,

Speaker 1:          02:18          how about what other people thought I was doing, I wouldn't have gotten out of my 35 year marriage.

Speaker 3:          02:25          Yeah. Just becoming more of an individual, loving myself more, allowed me to not want to fit into a role or fit into this confines that society puts us in. I mean, even just shaving my hair and saying, screw you. Beauty concepts. You know, like,

Speaker 1:          02:40          yeah, when I got all day, I got rid of my braids. I was free. Yeah. It's too, uh, never have I ever wanted to live in another country. Three to one. Uh, that's right. That's our movement of Bali

Speaker 3:          03:00          in a month. We're bouncing to Bali. Yeah, of course. It's time to get out of here and all over the world could get two hour massages with a good tip for $14 and so ready. Let's go. No,

Speaker 1:          03:17          never. Have I ever lied to. You knew this was going to be question intentionally. Is that like what it means or just push the button and then we'll find out. You have, I mean, we have, okay. What I was thinking of just in terms of, you know, what's going on? Nothing.

Speaker 3:          03:43          Uh, yeah.

Speaker 1:          03:45          And then not telling you something.

Speaker 3:          03:49          I mean, I'm just thinking about, you know, lying, cheating, stealing, all the things that I've done in my life and like how toxic it was and negative and now it's just so clear and not like that. I don't know. I can say anything to you and do you hear me? And you support me in it, but I guess, yeah, fight for each other. That's the answer. It's great. Never have I ever said I love you to someone without meaning it.

Speaker 1:          04:17          Three, two, one. Oh No. Like nothing I've ever done it. I don't think I, yeah, me either. Like being in situations where it's expected or you received it. It's like a, I don't return that stuff unless I feel it. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          04:35          You're like, I love everyone, so it's fine. It's not real. Like, of course, I won't even tell you I love you when you're not in the mood when I don't feel it. But you always love me. I always loved it, but I'm not always feeling like I know. Right. I always live. I'm like Whitney Houston over here. Just be patient. Oh yeah. Well,

Speaker 1:          05:00          okay. You ever have I ever wondered how I would die? Three two, one, two fad

Speaker 3:          05:13          on one on one after one on one time. Okay. Yeah, of course. How are you today? They've

Speaker 1:          05:19          hopefully in your arms.

Speaker 3:          05:21          Oh, I don't know what some sad or give me like just past together and it's a beautiful way.

Speaker 1:          05:29          You got other why? Because you got a lot more years after me. I am a kid. Yeah. We can't do that.

Speaker 3:          05:36          Um, I definitely would love for it to be peaceful and surrounded by my friends and family and like have a party. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          05:45          Never have I ever been disappointed in you.

Speaker 4:          05:56          Mm.

Speaker 1:          05:59          Oh, I can't be disappointed. I know. Yeah. I mean I get frustrated and irritated and annoyed and angry and intolerant and upset with you, but never disappointed.

Speaker 3:          06:17          Never have I ever felt unlovable.

Speaker 2:          06:19          Hello.

Speaker 3:          06:23          Oh, I did it again. Okay. Three, two. Okay. Um, yeah, there is the half of my life I felt unlovable and then I started to love myself.

Speaker 2:          06:37          No rarely these days because you've showered me with so much love and helped me to love myself. You really have, I mean, you've transformed me year and a half unrecognizable. My life is unrecognizable.

Speaker 1:          06:56          Never have I ever correct. Never have I ever thought about having kids with you.

Speaker 3:          07:05          Oh, this is where we're going.

Speaker 1:          07:09          Gosh, I wish we had time, but maybe next week. Thanks for coming. Thanks for playing.

Speaker 3:          07:19          Yeah. I, but not because necessarily I want to birth a child in this world right now because we could totally birth and awesome being, but I don't feel like the call for, I think we're birthing projects then I feel good about it also. We really just can't do that. Oh you mean,

Speaker 1:          07:41          well I have had a couple of kids. Um, have I thought about having kids with you? Yeah, of course it happened. [inaudible] there's so much time we don't have to figure that out and there are lots of children who, so many children to be adopted. Sorry if it came to that. I mean, you know, I love baby. I ain't need no other babies and puppies. Let's just adopt a lot of puppies in Bali. Evolving weird barking crazy dog and balding. Yeah.

Yeah. That's cause you're a professional. Thank you. Like this. These, these are sensitive questions and like it just shows us, shows me at least how much work we're doing and how vulnerable and open and honest we are. And so that just feels really good. The work works. It works if you work it right,
