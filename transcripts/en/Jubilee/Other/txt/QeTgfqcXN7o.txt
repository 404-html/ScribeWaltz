Speaker 1:          00:01          I've always wanted to drive across the country. I just never thought I quit my job to do it.

Speaker 1:          00:17          Let me back up as long as I can remember, I wanted to make films, tell stories, but having traditional parents that wasn't safe for them. You know the meme that goes, Hey dad, I want to be an actor, and he says, son, it's pronounced doctor. That was my life. So I took the traditional route and studied computer science on the side. I made films, tried to make a difference, but ultimately I took the job that every parent can brag about at dinner parties coming out of college, I took a job thinking I would change the world, help. I thought I was the change at the beginning. I made the most of every day and it was novel and exciting. I was working with interesting people and I made it my mission to learn something new. Every day I had a spark, learn, innovate, fail, repeat, creepy. But over time things started to change. The novelty was gone and my life became routine. I drank the same coffee, made the same calls, took the same route to work each day was a copy of itself. One day while I was working, I came across this design website and had a list of rules, life rules. I started reading them.

Speaker 1:          02:13          Rule number two 33 never fucking so well. Number one 68 make a fucking difference.

Speaker 2:          02:25          Ooh,

Speaker 1:          02:29          we're on number two oh five get in over your fucking head. Rule number 58 is your fucking hang out.

Speaker 2:          02:51          Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:53          Those rules that could back to me every day since I read them my whole life, I tried to live by those rules. I had broken every fucking one. When I first started working, I thought it was going to make a difference.

Speaker 2:          03:18          Okay?

Speaker 1:          03:18          And now I realized I was just another employee,

Speaker 2:          03:23          nothing number.

Speaker 1:          03:29          I didn't want to wake up at the end of my career realizing that all they did was survive. Just another drop in the bucket who went along to pay off his mortgage is student debt. So I finally did it. I pack my stuff, closed out my projects and gave my notice.

Speaker 2:          03:55          I quit.

Speaker 1:          04:05          Trust me. It's much easier said than done.

Speaker 2:          04:08          Okay?

Speaker 1:          04:13          Honestly, I'm not looking to be happy. Some days I'm miserable in aching. I'm interested in, and that's where the living room,

Speaker 2:          04:25          right

Speaker 1:          04:34          as I drive across the country, I'm going to places far outside my comfort zone. Places I've never heard of. Small towns, people, they're countless stories, landscapes I never knew existed. Sunrises and sunsets. I sleep in the car on the road in $20 motels. Breathing air is so fresh. It makes my heart race at times. It's grueling and I love every moment of it. I've always wanted to tell stories about real people that changed lives, and I'm going to do just that. My name is Tamra Chavon and I'm out to tell the stories of those who are finding their own way. The ones who, who've swam upstream for what they believe in, the ones who left the life of safety for something greater. The ones who were cast aside only to make their own path, the innovators, the trendsetters, some might call them the crazy.
