Speaker 1:          00:04          I live in La. Three people in your friends wound up here and I always visit and then I would drive through the Hollywood hills and see these homes and I was thinking, I need to do this. You know, I need to be here.

Speaker 2:          00:21          For some people they prefer to sit behind a desk from eight to five. I fall asleep. It's all about energy.

Speaker 3:          00:36          I drive a lot, man. Um, you guys sat in from like Pasadena or way to thousand oaks to Hollywood, Beverly Hills and you got good reviews. It good polls, but you see why they pay the price. I'm from the island of Guam smile in 26 miles long. All my siblings are back home. Just me out here.

Speaker 2:          01:03          I tell my clients that I'm 25 but I am early twenties. The good thing is, is the clients that I work with are all very young people. Like they're all kind of doing the same thing as me because I utilize social media. The people that I connect with on, there are younger people who are, you know, you tubers or music artists or music producers. Every client, you know, they want a house in a different area. So I'm all over the place. You know, I'm running from Venice, Santa Monica all the way, you know, it's even silver lake,

Speaker 3:          01:38          12 pills a day. It'd be, takes you half an hour to clean the pool. It's definitely 20 bucks. You can say it's about managing time because if you stay out of your morning for 12 hours a day, you're pretty much making less than minimum wage. I think the hours that I put in for both jobs, the most 16 the minimum 12 hours, I say like, Dude. Yeah, and that's just to survive in California, you know,

Speaker 2:          02:06          most of the deals I do are like 5 million and under mostly because a lot of my clients are younger. Do you see the big purchases that are like 20 million plus? Those ones are usually older people, you know, it just makes sense. You've been on the planet longer, you've made more money, you can afford it. I mean my office, we have the $188 million listing up in Bel Air. They were really trying to get Jay Z and Beyonce to buy the home. They thought it was perfect for them. They have been trying to connect with every single billionaire in the world. That's quite a risk you're taking kneepads cause as the day goes by when you keep kneeling down on your knees about padding, it tends to hurt.

Speaker 4:          02:53          Hey, how's it going dude?

Speaker 3:          03:02          So this is the asset tag. This is the chlorine tank. You mix chlorine and acid together. You can chemically make mustard gas. I once mix Corrine and acid in the wrong tank on accident and you can endure like burn marks. But inside your system from the smoke itself, you learn your lessons after each things happen.

Speaker 2:          03:25          Properties when they're forced sale and you get commissioned and it's, if you're representing the buyer, the standard is typically 2.5% of the purchase price. Honestly. How much do you think this house is? It's like a town house or is it Venice? One and a half, 3.3

Speaker 3:          03:45          wipe provides it for me, gives me everything that I needed to try to keep me safe out here. Her name is April. I worked at the UFC gym in 2015 for her at the gym was like a getaway for her to go relax. Why people do that, you know, man, I I if I didn't meet her, I'll probably say I used to sleep in the back of the gym, the UFC gym. Like hadn't, you know, I'll wake up, train, train people, um, teaching class and that's it. You know, that's like a bachelors, a lifestyle. Like now as I try to help her pursue her career first and also like try to secure financial for her and my, my two cats, you know, like, um, it makes me happy.

Speaker 2:          04:29          Are you going to, that's the goal, you know, and you don't even have to live in it and you can make money from it. I had a client who I, I showed him a, a house in studio city, the La Galaxy soccer team did a photo shoot at the house for one night and then paid them $30,000. It's right now we're going to see Catherine and she's leasing this home, um, for about $14,000 a month in commission, somewhere around 7,000. You know Elise still you make a whole lot less than a sale but so one time, 7,000, right, exactly. And then, and then in this case scenario, you know, I found her this lease and now this lease is turned, has turned into a sale. You know, cause I'm going to be finding her property to buy now. Hey you I know.

Speaker 5:          05:31          Try trying to like three or four. That's how much after,

Speaker 2:          05:36          I mean I was thinking like the foothills stadio, Cindy Sherman oaks. So you're on the backside of the hill. That's fine. It's way cheaper and that's fine. You can drive down to Ventura or he can drive Laurel Canyon. It's La. I have to drive through this all the time. Yeah, we all do. So used to it by now and get them, make sure you have a place for all those cars. We want to be to at least park two to three cars in a garage and um, at least be able to put maybe like four cars outside, which is why it's important to like this one right here. Oh, that looks nice. Not have a pool. It does. And picky, but I'm not, I know what I like the dream client. Well that's good. I'm glad I'm the tree

Speaker 1:          06:19          Kia can to complain. They'll watch you. They'll look out the window, had a lady, she pretty much watch you and to make sure you do everything that's on that checklist. How did that go when gray, you know, it makes my job so much easier when my clients are actually my friends and she said she'll spend up to 4 million. What is 2.5% of 4 million? I love tender Greens. It's so good. And it's not even expensive.

Speaker 2:          07:06          I don't watch very many interviewers, but I'd definitely uh, I've always watched Danny. It's videos. We're going to go meet up with him and this house has a nightclub in it. So it could be interesting.

Speaker 3:          07:18          Life out here is different now. Like you go to island slow, everyone's chilling here. Everyone's moving my salary back there, it was like, what? 15,000 a year

Speaker 2:          07:29          on a bad email. One of my deals just close. So that was coke get some coffee. So this was actually like small, you know, 2.5% of it. It's like roughly around $10,000. It's definitely not bad for not even stepping foot on this property. Are you doing man? Yeah. One more. And one more

Speaker 3:          07:53          coworker she's checking. You know that usually maybe like eight how many more poles you got man, this conversation, you know, cause like it's not a lonely job, but it's just like either listening to music or you talked to your other coworkers. He know it's just a dream job. But I like to work in animation, but I don't know how to draw, so I'm not really going to try to pursue that. You know, you're like in your mind you can configure it. It's down to the very last screw or very less sketch when when you actually take paper to pencil, it doesn't come out man.

Speaker 2:          08:29          No, you guys are excited about this. The good thing is it's only $23, but I don't know how I got, I got a parking ticket. Do you literally look at the sign and it says turn wheels to curb? I did not know. That was even a thing. Dude in my hometown to Michaela, my dad sells yachts and he's built and design boats because whole life, um, which is how I kind of first got into that and then I was like, man, this is pretty boring. Did you start out working for your dad's company? Yeah, I started, I started working under him, like following them around and learning, you know, and then I just didn't feel right. You know,

Speaker 3:          09:17          my family back home, you know, they're simple people. I have two sisters and one brother. The two old days, they're not as vicious as a t young is. We all have our, our reasons, what we do and why we do. And one of the reason why I moved out here is because I wanted a better life.

Speaker 1:          09:42          How much is this for sale? Three. Three now. Yeah. I'm just looking at this house right now. 3 million up in the hills.

Speaker 5:          09:57          I want a little flavor, you know, besides just plain wires does a bad day. You're looking at approximately throat and rotate your shoulder phone, phone. Oh yeah, they got the movie theater and here to here. You got some full on bar. I don't even drink. What Papa of move in. Move Out to jab, cross, move in and move out.

Speaker 1:          10:32          Do you want to go home and get it like a foot massage man, after your own day? Like this

Speaker 2:          10:36          smile be even more busy. It's all about energy. Male, like having good energy in a class. Pushing people, keep them going. And it's fun.

Speaker 1:          10:50          It's crazy to think where am I going to be in five, 10 years?

Speaker 6:          10:55          Ooh.

Speaker 1:          10:57          And it's just the most wild thought to me cause I don't know. No one yet from Guam has ever fought in for a belt. My goal is to just make it onto one of the fighting organization doing glory. Man, I'd love to stand and bang all around it. It was just a great day, just grinding away, 15 hour shift today, you know? But it was overall good. Any job is great, but like are you going to wake up someone next you that loves you for who you are? It's not about being happy in the end, man. Where's it at you? Hey, where's the remote? Put It on some jubilee.
