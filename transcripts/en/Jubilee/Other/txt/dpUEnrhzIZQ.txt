Speaker 1:          00:00          Just one wild day. Ooh Bro. Cause you hit me with your car and I didn't even want I hit this man with my car. I'm sorry. Pause everything. What's up y'all okay? You always interrupted. Yeah, I'm as a writer. This is John and we've been a place in candy confession. Oh yes. It's about to get real. You're a little bit too close to my crotch.

Speaker 1:          00:26          Oh, hey bro. Hey Dude. I feel like I'm in time out right now. Isn't minutes I looked right. How do you get to know each other? We came out the same womb. That was a lie. That's a lie. We came out, I came up the womb of the sister-in-law of his mother were cousins. Yeah, that was a very complicated uh, yes or no. Pineapple is good on pizza. I promise you if you kill you dog by now, I don't understand why you have trust issues like that. You probably eat kit kats like without breaking them apart. First of all, I don't eat cake cats. I got Kevin, he son Miss me with that Nigga. He just had a rice crispy at Starbucks on the right side of my mouth. But look, this is what I'm trying to say. Hmm. Pineapples is a fruit. You Eat Cherries on your pizza?

Speaker 1:          01:22          No. Apple. Nah. Huh? How about water Malone? If pizza sauce had all of those, I would try it. It's like a fruit pizza, right? Oh, let me change your color for you. You're doing the wrong thing. Oh Bro. That's some pretty color though. When you just like time, you feel me? Like pineapple on my pizza, but I don't want him to not be my friend no more. So let me hit the, never have I ever Friday while laugh, Bro. Hey, what was in it right now? You're just like, cause I like, oh hey. She says something. Oh Man. I was like, hey. She was like, Hey. And I was like, oh my God. You laugh louder, right? Yeah. It was like, oh wait. Yes, Bro. Oh Man, man, that was, I just feel like farts has god gifts God's gift saying like, Hey, it's okay. I'm funny and power.

Speaker 1:          02:36          Never have I ever questioned if I'll ever make it. Dude, I was walking across the street this morning. I was like, I don't know if I got what it takes. So yes, if I've questioned it, no, I have not questioned it. I'm going make it. Wait, I'm lying. You know what I'm saying? I have, I've questioned it, but cause it's hard, bro. It's a lot of talented people in the world. A lot of funny people. A lot of cute. Yeah. People. I'm not even the most talented and I'm pretty ugly. But the thing is, I think that like, I think for the most part I got nothing. I just really think I really, honestly, you shouldn't beat yourself up about that, bro, about being ugly or being knocked down and you, because you're both, no, I am. I'm take courage. You pick up yes or no.

Speaker 1:          03:35          I could beat you in a street fight. Come on, Bro. You don't want this dude would win every fight we have. I would win every fight. That's not true. Look, it's about the heart. You know what I'm saying? Now somebody's saying no, it's about the fight, right? Yeah, but it's not, I got hard you remembering that dumb and dumber where he just reached in and took homeboys heart. Oh, oh, ever seeing King Kong? Nah. Yes, of course. I started getting it bro. You remember the part where my gene had the dinosaur's mouth and he made his mouth go like that. That's not what I would do to you know, but I thought I'd bring that up cause I really liked that movie scene. However it was for you would lose that hands facing site. We will let me catch you in the streets. Just come in dressed superman dude and I'm God God, forgive me for that one. Never have I ever divide my parents.

Speaker 1:          04:33          I think maybe both of us kind of like deciding to follow our actual purpose and not listen to our parents and everybody else that was speaking logically to us. Like to wake up and say for him to be like, Yo, I want to be a rapper. I wanted to pursue music full time. Or for me to just wake up and be like, oh, I want to be a youtuber full time. I want to have businesses and I want to be like an actor. I want to be famous one day parents don't see that and that doesn't make, that doesn't make sense cause then it's just like, it's not their fault, it's just that they were born in a different time. I think a lot of parents don't realize that we're born in a totally different generation and all this stuff is possible through like social media and stuff like that.

Speaker 1:          05:07          You know, I woke up yesterday and found my face on the front of Apple Music, one of the genres. I was like, Oh snap, my face is right there. You know what I'm saying? And it brings you back to this. It's like, oh, we can either aid the logical go to school just like everybody else because apparently it's like one in a million people that makes this, you know what I'm saying? That is able to do this. But that's only half true. If you put 100% in and you have people that support you and let's be honest, if you're, you're good at it, you're talented at what you're doing, then there's no reason for you to not succeed unless you just do something stupid. Yes sir. No, I'm done in freestyle rap for you right now. Don't ever let go even mean beat. All right, let's get table.

Speaker 1:          06:00          Yeah, it was, yeah. Yeah. Okay. Josh, he did. As a writer sitting at the table, we're only talking about the stories and you know, it ain't no fables then his freestyle, they just Duke and you know, I can't remember at the time I get on this, you know, I'll be delighted to rec pool, but I've got that green going to get what you don't think. Glean. I don't drink no name. What's your, no, I'm leaving and you know, funny and I've got the money, but I don't get fine. Red Light, green light and try to get them me. But if I hit this Nigga yet, it's going to be cleaned by, not a fair fight, but I'm going to do it right. Yeah. He said he gone take me like King Kong but that ain't buys. Huh? Okay. Oh my bad. You want it to keep in mind that I thought I had more cause that was low key whack to me and I wasn't pleased with that.

Never have I ever there, have I ever imagined beating up a complete stranger? I had a beat up a complete stranger. No, I'm just kidding. I got beat up by a complete stranger. It's definitely cause I wasn't there. That ain't that literally actually the real reason bro. Come on. I got you bro. Also, you would lose that fight that we Nah. Ah, okay. Well let me, the one thing that would just make you say, that's enough. We got to throw hands. Ooh. Honestly we throw hands on. Yeah, but like real, real life. Just like, look man, I'm like Loki Authority type of stuff. Oh Bro. Okay. First of all, I mean by you looking I'm door, let's get that out. But that's crazy.

Speaker 1:          07:57          But um, okay. Um, let me see. I feel like I'm a very level headed person. Very whatever you do would have to be repeated multiple times or like talk to be wild.
