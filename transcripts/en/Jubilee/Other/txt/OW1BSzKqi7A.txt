Speaker 1:          00:00          I started using cocaine and Lsd when I was 12 years old. I stopped taking LSD when I jumped out of a window and fractured two of my ribs. However, I still use drugs due to my depression and because they helped me forget everything. 12 years old. That's young.

Speaker 2:          00:38          My Dad has been a heavy alcoholic all my life now he's suffering from liver and kidney failure because he won't stop ounce speak to him anymore and ignore his calls. I had a relative in my life who also had a drinking problem. There are a lot of feelings that come with it and there's a lot of rage that comes with it. I don't blame you for not wanting to talk to him, but try if he can find it in yourself. I'm not saying forgive. I think that may help them a lot too because it's an addiction as a disease.

Speaker 3:          01:21          I stole money from my boss to support my gambling addiction. He ended accuser accusing. My mom was stealing it.

Speaker 4:          01:29          The reason I'm

Speaker 3:          01:32          this really like this was me to the t,

Speaker 4:          01:36          but

Speaker 3:          01:38          I have a lot of people around me that a don't allow me to do this and if I do do it, they're there for me. If you want the help, it's there.

Speaker 1:          01:51          At the age of 11, I sought a comfort of pornography due to feeling that my parents saw me as inadequate. Every moment I was anxious that my secret would be exposed and that my perceived reality would become real. That nobody could love me. I've felt for a long time that nobody could love me and I thought that my parents didn't think that I was adequate either. And reaching for other things to fill that hole is really common. Yeah. And I can empathize with that.

Speaker 5:          02:28          I'm only 16. I've been valley addiction with prescription pain medication that I received for an injury three years ago. Oh, we read that one.

Speaker 4:          02:47          Okay.

Speaker 5:          02:50          I'm only 16 and barely addiction. It's prescription pain medication that I received for an injury three years ago. I don't want to die this young, but I'm too afraid.

Speaker 4:          03:00          Totally parents.

Speaker 5:          03:06          Um, I know it's like to be I did to the drug is 16 since I been getting high as this house. 14 surely 16 million got so much. Hope so much live for it and I probably hear that a lot. And you don't believe it. I had no, I didn't. It's hard to have that secret. I get it. But um, if you keep holding that pain in, it's going to kill you.

Speaker 1:          03:29          My best friend is addicted to taking drugs to help her cope with her depression. And one of the few people who know it feels like I'm carrying something heavy around with me. I feel like you should try to talk to her and help her get some help before it gets too late because I had to deal with that. I had to watch my own boyfriend passed away because I'm, I couldn't really help him. Hmm.

Speaker 4:          04:15          Okay.

Speaker 1:          04:16          I am diagnosed with severe depression and I'm addicted to cutting myself. I've only told one person about this and I know deep down they're disappointed in me. I wish someone could support me without judgment.

Speaker 4:          04:31          Okay.

Speaker 1:          04:32          I've done a lot of things to cope with my depression. It's been almost a year since the night, and I never ever thought it was possible to go that long without it ever. If you don't believe in yourself and no one's there to tell you that they believe in you, then I do. And so many other people do

Speaker 4:          04:57          never talked about that before. You know, when we go to support groups or meetings or whatever it is, you put our problems out there because unfortunately there's other people that have had this happen to them. You know, we are not alone. You know, there's always somebody, no matter what it is.
