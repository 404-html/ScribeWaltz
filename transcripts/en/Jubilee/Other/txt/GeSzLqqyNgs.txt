Maybe about a few months after we ended up moving and that was the start of moving all the time. I went to Buffalo State College in my last year. I was like, you know what, I've outgrown this place. I don't feel like it's given me anything. Um, I was actually like depressed that just wasn't happy. And then I decided to move to California and I moved here by myself with very little money. But I have a lot of faith and I believe that if you really want something it's because you're supposed to have it. So I just, we just did it and now I'm here.
