Speaker 1:          00:05          I think my boyfriend's cheating on me with my godsister.

Speaker 1:          00:19          I had just transferred to a new high school. It was scary and know anybody there. I thought that was going to be my only problem in high school. For the first time in my life, I started to experience a release of your issues with my health. I had all of these scars and open wounds on my back that I could never reach. So here I was in this new high school, live an immune system that was just kind of falling apart on itself. But there was one person there who looked at me and said, hey, you are really amazing. He would make me feel like there was nothing wrong with me. He would be with me when I was sick. You would put lotion on my scars. First three months of our relationship I was really, really happy. But after three months he started to get possessive.

Speaker 1:          01:16          Everyone I was talking to made him uncomfortable. It kept cutting off. People thinking one day I'll make the right group of friends and he'll be okay and then it started getting worse. It didn't matter if it was my shoulder or my arm or my hands or my thighs. He had had to be touching me and I kept making all these excuses as to why it was okay. So I kept going on like that. After about a year and a half to two years, um, my family decided they wanted to send me to the Philippines and my grandparents were over there and they want me to stay with them. And when I finally told him, he started crying, got really, really upset and he said, you're going to be gone for a month. Why do you have to go now? Why do you, why do you need to be going to the Philippines for a month?

Speaker 1:          02:15          I'll be here when you come back, but please just come back right away. And I felt guilty because I was actually really glad that I didn't have phone service for a lot of it because I had an excuse. I was like, I don't, I can't contact you because I'm with my family. I could just explore and be free with my family. We had taken these really cute pictures in the Philippines. My profile picture for the last year and a half of our relationship was a photo of the two of us and I thought, you know what? I think you'd like this one. And I have, it's been a year since I've changed it, but then my godsister 30 commenting on it, she thought it was really cute. And then my boyfriend started commenting to, this is the first time my boyfriend has ever gone in along with a friend of mine. This is the friend I needed to have in my life so that my relationship can be okay. The next day. He told me that the two of them had stayed up until 7:00 AM webcamming with each other and just talking. And I thought it was a little strange, but it was kind of cute. And then a couple of days later he told me, I think we need to wait until you come home if we're going to talk.

Speaker 1:          03:41          I kept asking him, what's going on? What happened? Are you okay? And he said, no, something's going on. And it's not a good time to talk to you. I was so upset. Like, why would you just cut me out? Like personally, I don't understand why you're doing this to me. It hit me that something was going on between the two of them. So I got angry and I messaged him and I told him, what are you doing? What's going on between you two? Cause I don't understand and why can you talk to her? But you can't talk to me. My grandparents, I think my boyfriend's cheating on me with my godsister, the same boy that had been to their 50th anniversary just a couple months ago. The Guy, I told them I thought I was gonna marry and I came home, he met me at my house and um, I had a box ready with all of his things. He was smiling the whole time. He told me, you know, I love you

Speaker 2:          04:54          and

Speaker 1:          04:56          my life will never be the same because of you. That even at school my ex would still comment on all the things about our relationship that didn't work. He specifically told me if there's one thing I don't miss about our relationship. I was taking care of you when you were sick. My health, it's all time low. Well, it's like my body knew that he wasn't there to take care of me anymore. My hair started coming out.

Speaker 1:          05:33          I didn't have any energy to get up out of my bed. Everything about me was breaking and everyone could see it. I felt so bad because I knew it was killing my parents, but they were all I had. I woke up 3:00 AM one night and I was trying to get to the bathroom because my skin was stinking. I heard my mom to my dad, she was so upset. She's like, this is getting so expensive. We can't afford, zoo is forever. My Dad was comforting her and telling her, you know, we'll find a way to pay for things and we'll be okay. And it didn't even sound like he was convinced. And I realized if there is nobody on this earth that I am doing any good for anymore and if the two people I love most, I am hurting. I don't want to be here anymore. Like I had had suicidal thoughts before, but this time I was sure it went to the bathroom. I took the rest of my steroids. I snuck downstairs and there was about a quarter bottle of vodka and a fridge that none of us had touched, so I drank that with all of my pills

Speaker 1:          06:59          that went back upstairs to my bed and I went to sleep. I didn't want them to think it was their fault when and if I died the next morning I woke up,

Speaker 1:          07:12          I felt nothing and have a stomach ache. I didn't have to go to the bathroom. It was like I had never taken the pills at all. That was the worst feeling in the world. After about a year, I started getting better. My skin started to heal up and I wasn't perfect. I went to this one acupuncturist who said it was because of my emotional state that my body wasn't able to produce the healthy bacteria. It needed to make everything better. Now it's five or six years later, it's still hear his voice in the back of my head. I wish I could forget, but I'm here.

Speaker 2:          07:58          Yeah.
