Speaker 1:          00:00          He is a famous dance move.

Speaker 2:          00:02          Please come on. I know if the world's ready for that.

Speaker 1:          00:06          Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:06          It's just real small movements in the knees. Handed the head.

Speaker 3:          00:12          Go Darling.

Speaker 2:          00:24          I am Jake Scott. I am 27 years old and I am a musician

Speaker 1:          00:30          and I'm Rachel Scott. I am 30 years old and I am an actress and a writer. Friends for five years, dating four years, married two years, two and a half.

Speaker 3:          00:45          Can you hear me? I can read your lips.

Speaker 2:          00:50          I had just moved to la like five days before and I got invited to go play ultimate Frisbee. I was totally going there thinking I'm not going to meet a girl. I just moved to this new city like I have no plans for meeting girls. And then I met Rachel and I was like, oh crap, this girl is something else. It was made known to me by all of her friends like, hey, she's totally still into her ex boyfriend, so just don't get your heartbroken. And I was like, yeah, cool. Thanks for the advice, but I'm gonna I'm going to proceed forward here because if I didn't try, I knew that I would never forgive myself for that.

Speaker 1:          01:27          It must have been a Saturday because we were playing ultimate frisbee. I had gone through a breakup in January. We met in July. He stood out to me, but I was like, I was not on the market, so I was just like, oh, this is a nice guy. We started hanging out a lot. I was like, I know who I'm marrying. It's this other guy over here and also I can't stop hanging out with Jake and all my friends are like, okay, we get it. You can stop telling us you don't like Jake. Why do you keep bringing up Jake? And I was like, yeah, I don't like Jake. Okay. I don't like Jake. But he was unlike anyone I had met and our connection was unlike anything I had met. But that was confusing at first for me.

Speaker 3:          02:03          I said, we met at Frisbee. Me Too.

Speaker 2:          02:06          I said there was a lingering ex boyfriend who is still occupying her affection at the time.

Speaker 1:          02:11          Same. I mean how can we forget that this was a drama for so long story short, I finally am done with ex boyfriend. Tell him and then about a month later I see Jake. It was like a curtain had been pulled back so he picks me up. We go to Joan's on third,

Speaker 2:          02:30          we went to Joan's on third in studio city cause we both love that place. It's like our favorite

Speaker 1:          02:35          and I know that sounds crazy but I remember sitting there thinking if I don't marry this guy, I just really felt at peace with him in that moment. And then we wanted to hike. We were there for a long time just talking. I guess after that we would, back to his apartment, we got Thai food.

Speaker 2:          02:50          I had bought this like behemoth bottle of cheap red wine. I was like trying to be smooth and coolest stuff like that. Then the bag just rips out from the bottom of the bottle smashes. He cleans

Speaker 1:          03:00          it up, he gets us another bottle of wine and I was, I mean it was just like really showed his heart the way he handled that very small moment. We went on a walk and we ended up with this like hill where we overlooked la.

Speaker 2:          03:16          Okay, you're talking about Narnia. Yeah. You did forgot about Narnia. Oh, this is the best part of the date. I actually couldn't hear anything. It was in my hands doing this. You did this and I was like, oh my gosh. Narnia. No, her name is where I knew I loved Rachel will. You knew before I knew that, but that was like confirmation to me cause it was like this is the most perfect moment of my life.

Speaker 2:          03:40          I said at first I had made this weird, silly commitment to myself that I was only going to say I love you to a person. When I knew I could follow up on it, I want to mean it when I say it and I want to only say it to one person. Hopefully we went on a trip with my family to Paris. It was the last night at the trip, I had written Rachel this really long letter. And um, I told her that I loved her for the first time and I actually proposed at the end of the letter. So I said, I love you for the first time when I proposed

Speaker 1:          04:16          no, I think I might cry. Um, so he said, I love you first and the reason it's making me cries because I just had such a history of like throwing my heart around. And I had said, I love you a million times. And so to think that this whole time there was some guy holding out to only say it to one person and that I'm that one person that's really,

Speaker 2:          04:40          um, amazing. I want it to mean it. And I wanted to know that I could say that and know that I had waited to say that to one person than I knew I could be. You would be the only person I never say it to. And you are the only person I've ever said it to. No, I'm crying. I always want to come across as perfect. And so ultimately what that means is sometimes I would hide things from her and I wouldn't be honest, I'd lie like making decisions on how to manage money and there were times when I would make some mistakes over here, but then I would just be like, oh, I'm going to take care of this. I don't need to share this because I'll take care of it, I'll handle it, I'll handle it. And I would hide things from her until ultimately I couldn't hide him anymore. Seeing Rachel's face when she found out that I was lying to her about anything, it's just like the most heartbreaking thing I've had to go through. Hell man.

Speaker 1:          05:48          Being in a relationship where I'm truly vulnerable for the first time, I think with that comes out the best and the worst of you. And when I'm sad or feel I cover it with anger, I can get so mad and then I'll be mad at him and I'll be aware of like, oh, this is whatever I'm angry at isn't really his fault. But it's hard to let go of anger in those moments because what I'll do is I'll go out in the world and give my best to everyone else and then come home and be exhausted and if something's gone wrong in my day, I'll take it out on him. If that happens enough, you know, it's affects him and so it really makes you start dealing with your stuff that you've kind of put away in corners and not dealt with or made excuses for.

Speaker 2:          06:29          The consequences of my actions now don't just affect me. They affect you too. And it's made me grow up in a lot of ways. Yeah. If you would look on paper at the things that we've gone through, like we haven't had like any traumatic event happened to us, but like being so connected, like your souls are connected, you don't just wake up knowing how to do that the right way. You know,

Speaker 1:          06:51          Andy, you come into marriage typically thinking you're doing well and then it exposes all these things in the relationship. And so I think to have a healthy relationship you have to be healthy individuals through getting healthy on our own. The marriage and turn becomes healthier.

Speaker 3:          07:08          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          07:12          I love how Rachel feels so passionately about everything. She sees the beauty in humanity and in the world and it is such a joy to have her in my life because it makes me see the beauty and everything like in just little things that I would just walk past and never think about. Like she just, she feels, it's so deeply, she's like the color and my world. Like you are so much better than I could've ever dreamed and you honestly make me such a better man.

Speaker 3:          07:49          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          07:49          I am super up and down. I feel a lot and he is so steady and he's also really taught me about vulnerability and intimacy because again, I had so many past relationships where I was never truly intimate or truly vulnerable is just given me a safe place to be myself and to actually be intimate and vulnerable with someone.

Speaker 2:          08:14          You really are everything to me. So I was going to say, you are my world and I'm truly would be in shambles without you. I have no idea. I'd probably be dead in a ditch somewhere.

Speaker 1:          08:25          Farmer in Ohio, Ohio is great, but you know, it's hard for me to talk about the way I feel, but I really do love you and you are truly the only person for me, like really? If you left or died, I would just be happily single because you are the only person I want to be with. I really am so thankful for you. Let me do

Speaker 3:          08:55          it's breakfast

Speaker 4:          08:57          together while she's sleeping in your high school sweater. Never seen anything better. It's the season three. You watch evening or your best friend. Oh, it's snow.
