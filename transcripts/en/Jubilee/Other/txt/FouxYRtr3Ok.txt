Speaker 3:          00:24          a string of first dates and by dates I mean like grab a beer and then you kind of talk a little bit, start to ghost each other and then he's like the first one to watch me on Instagram and that's it. And then you never talk again. It's weird going from a life of dating apps to it being in person. So I'm a little nervous but like excited, nervous.

I'm still trying to look for a church right now since I'm like, you're chopping fine drones is what I'm doing. Race drones from freestyle. Then, um, yesterday I was just had to race in the competition for it. I have a son who's 18 months. I mean I kinda got catfished ones, but like by a completely different person or they just didn't look the same. She just nothing like her, like her pictures.

Speaker 3:          04:47          Don't think so. Is that bad? No. Um, I think I had really enjoyed them all as people and I, I picked them all because I do find some part of them attractive, but I just didn't feel like that all around connection that I was hoping for. I think I need to put myself out there more. I think I'm more of the person that's like, I'm too busy. Let's wait till it happens. So maybe that's something I need to do. It'll just be less of a priority using apps and more of like inner actions with people. So I'm just going to lay off the apps for a little bit because even in person that was hard, like that was rough.

Speaker 2:          05:26          Thank you. Oh Man.

Speaker 1:          05:32          Okay.
