Speaker 1:          00:16          I love my husband. I love him even though he's snoring. Wakes me up every morning. It's my daily bench food network says you should only get one item in your eggs, but Louis likes everything in them cause it's how his mom made them. He calls it eggs with everything I call it grows, but that's how he loves them. Especially when the boys and I do all the laundry because my mom told me that a man with dirty clothes as a man that's not loved by his wife. Yeah, I know it's old fashioned now is whites are always white and all his coworkers will know he's loved. He always promises to do it next time, but I'll never let him.

Speaker 2:          01:39          Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:40          I know he loves me because every time I hit off to work I feel him watching me leave sl

Speaker 2:          01:52          uniform.

Speaker 1:          02:07          One of my favorite things is my commute to work. It's my time to myself and it lets me clear my head before the stress of the day.

Speaker 2:          02:40          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          03:05          It looks like you have c d or Fukes. Coronial endothelial dystrophy

Speaker 1:          03:17          I can barely pronounce is taking away my vision and I will probably lose my whole career over it. I won't be able to scare the we anymore. What am I supposed to tell him?

Speaker 2:          04:11          Okay.

Speaker 1:          04:13          I can't make it silly. Anx with everything.

Speaker 2:          04:17          Have a bad dream or did you all right? Sorry.

Speaker 1:          04:32          The people he works with are going to think I stopped caring about him.

Speaker 3:          04:48          Just talk to me. Right,

Speaker 1:          04:53          so thing is going on. Something is wrong. You're not talking to me. Please tell me what's going on. Now when all I want to do is breathe and walk to work alone, I can't because they won't let me. How do you tell the person you love that you're going blind?

Speaker 3:          05:30          I can't help but think that I'm becoming is patient, not his partner.

Speaker 1:          05:41          Maybe he'd be happy with someone else. Someone who won't be a burden.

Speaker 4:          06:04          My wife is going blind you. She doesn't want my help.

Speaker 3:          06:15          I want to wake up every morning and tell her that I love her. That's all going to be okay of. I wish I could do all the cooking, but she says, don't do it. She's even figured out the laundry. Start going to work. Taking the bus alone stops every time to think about it. Crossing streets of downtown, even though she doesn't know every day, because that's what you're love is right. This is more than just a feeling. It's an action Sicilian. We'll never know which I do for him. That's how I still love her.
