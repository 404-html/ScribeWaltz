Speaker 1:          00:00          What do you think overall was the hardest part?

Speaker 2:          00:06          The divorce. It was the hardest, you know, time of my life at least. Um, it was just as there's a dark, dark time.

Speaker 1:          00:24          So first off, can you just say your name and Jimmy Chai? 40 years old.

Speaker 2:          00:33          Taletha Chai, 41, don't believe him. Uh, we were in college working for the, uh, the college newspaper and he came running in and he had long hair at the time. It looked like an Asian Jesus. I don't know. There was just something about him that I liked and I hadn't even really heard him talk much. Just something about his presence. I like thought up something to ask him and we just started talking from there.

Speaker 3:          01:11          Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:12          Uh, she borrowed money from me. There was a time when I'm at night where we were just bored and just laying out the paper. And so there was a, a calendar of quotes on the date of the table and if you want to say like these inspirational things. And so I would tell her, hey, as a joke, anytime someone walks to the door, I'm just going to sneak in a quote to the person and just see if they catch it and she would die laughing. Do you know any way? Lessen the jokes. I think I just want a little bit. So that's when I knew so many, uh, so many what you could actually, I don't know if she wants me to tell her this story, but I'm going to say it anyway. Can you hear me? No. One time she, um, she, she was driving home and she had to go to the bathroom to go pee. And so instead of pulling over because she was rushing home and I don't remember why she was rushing home, but she had a coffee cup in her thing. And so she peed in a coffee cup. She's gonna hate me for this, by the way. I know she didn't hit me, but it's okay.

Speaker 2:          02:28          We just, without saying anything, know what the other person, where they're going to go and what they're going to say are almost like finishing each other's sentences or something. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:40          She's a very, like probably the most pure hearted person I know. Like we have two beautiful daughters right now and I wouldn't want anybody else to be the mother of my children. Looking back, it's like you forget the little moments, you know? Like I was telling him the story about how we used to have the calendar, remember never enough to close when people walk in and you'd be dying that,

Speaker 2:          03:01          yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Things that other people would think would just be so wrong with us as we're like, no, that's that to be happening.

Speaker 1:          03:15          I knew I wanted to give me the mother of my children because of who you are. Like I knew you'd be an amazing mother. It was just like a heads down delete. Just going to be an amazing mom. And I wanted this woman to be the mother of my children

Speaker 2:          03:29          early. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          03:34          It wasn't what I would call a typical dating courtship where it leads up to a proposal. It was very up and down. It was an emotional rollercoaster.

Speaker 2:          03:49          Well, we were still just so disconnected at the time and so our communication really wasn't there. Like, I don't know, we just sort of let it pass by that couple unit. Um, just seems like 200 people, right?

Speaker 1:          04:07          Yeah. I got to see the one thing that we found common ground and always was Seinfeld when Seinfeld was huge and the one thing that would always bring us back together dating us, it's like Seinfeld, okay, we're finding those flashlights all is good with the world.

Speaker 2:          04:23          I was on the living room floor and I was playing with our two children. It was just like late at night. And I remember realizing all of a sudden that I was very lonely and that um, I felt like a single mom

Speaker 1:          04:40          and how

Speaker 2:          04:44          they were three and five, they wouldn't remember a whole lot. I just knew that the healthier route would be to do this now and we weren't where people that would not want to live our life like that. It was a lot of this is how you're supposed to be. Like, why won't you be like this?

Speaker 1:          05:11          No, to be honest with you, looking back, it was just more of a frustration from my side and I blamed her for a lot of stuff. So I played a lot of victim and I felt very stifled and looking back it was more me than it was her. I knew we shouldn't have been married to begin with, so it wasn't like a, I knew the marriage was over, like we fought on our wedding day the whole time. It was crazy. We were so attached to the way it looked like and on top of that I had pressure from my family. It wasn't fair to her and like she had no shot to be honest with you, with me now looking back, oh my gosh, I self sabotage the whole way

Speaker 2:          05:51          most of my life. It was just easier to just keep everything inside, deal with it myself and just react to things. And so I regret not telling you in a, in a really productive way what I needed most, which was what a partnership to walk next to each other.

Speaker 2:          06:17          It was just awkward bill for a very long time. Eventually just the friendship started to come back. We, we've, we talk about the same things. We find the same things interesting. Um, he is one of the longest relationships that I've had in my life besides that we'd had in our lives besides our parents and our siblings. We just want to be the best people we could possibly be. Our marriage was filled with just holding our faults to each other and you know, holding, holding what was right or wrong about each other against each other. And now we're really obsessed with that. There is no right and there is no wrong and we're really obsessed with, I'm not giving up. We're really obsessed with that. This is a process.

Speaker 3:          07:06          I mean,

Speaker 1:          07:08          to be honest with you, if you look at our relationship now, people would think we're married because we get along so well and I don't know too many couples that get along like us. Whether you're married or not married. It's difficult for my relationships that I have now with girlfriends because they don't understand this. I can't. And so that's why I don't have, that's why I'm single.

Speaker 3:          07:31          Okay.

Speaker 2:          07:31          That I value this relationship that has been such a big part of who I am because we have children. I know that we're going to have a relationship for a really long time. And I guess just sometimes I imagine the end of my life being able to look at you and without saying a word no, that we shared a pretty amazing journey.

Speaker 1:          08:09          I, I wish I was kinder to you. I wish I was more understanding. I wish was more authentic and wish I was there more.

Speaker 3:          08:23          She had no idea

Speaker 2:          08:26          what I regretted the most, was not being open enough and are really telling you what was on my mind.

Speaker 1:          08:36          For me it was I wish over kinder to you.

Speaker 2:          08:43          Okay.

Speaker 1:          08:44          Honest, authentic, loving and, and another thing that I didn't say was like committed. I was one foot in one foot out a lot of ways. What was it fair to you?

Speaker 2:          08:57          Yeah, we see the world the same way. We just don't live in the world the same way

Speaker 1:          09:03          we've been talked about us as a unit in a very long time. It's always about the kids. So it's pretty interesting.

Speaker 2:          09:11          Yeah. To us. This is really the only unit that we know. I talked a little bit about just how friendship was always just an underlying thing. Yeah. So

Speaker 1:          09:22          yeah, we were always really good friends to each other.

Speaker 2:          09:25          Okay. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          09:36          Okay.
