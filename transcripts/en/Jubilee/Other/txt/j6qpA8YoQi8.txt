Speaker 1:          00:00          Hey does this, Stephanie Vandenberg does this. Ana, we're going to play a game and candid can fashion. Um, uh, no, I am from Panama and I moved to the lake,

Speaker 2:          00:20          become a special effects makeup artists who have me, I'm Stephanie. Been Berg. I am a fashion designer and I'm a mother. I heard you guys met in a peculiar way. Can you tell me the story of how you met?

Speaker 1:          00:31          Oh, well we were in Panama and I was walking down the street and I saw her and I was like, I really want to do her makeup as a makeup artist. I saw her and to me she was like the perfect model. I went straight to her and I was like, Ken, either your makeup and let's like do a photo shoot or something please. We basically set up a team and we made an amazing photo shoot. Yeah, that was amazing. So who starts for anyone?

Speaker 2:          00:59          I go, okay, perfect. Never have I ever guns Kimmy. Dot. Dye Pink dipping. I don't know. What does that mean? I'm sorry.

Speaker 1:          01:10          When you go swimming completely naked.

Speaker 2:          01:13          Oh my God. Oh my God. It was like when on vacation with friends. Oh, I don't remember. So many times

Speaker 1:          01:23          maybe if I lay my own pool, maybe I would do it. But like anywhere else I'm like, no. Uh, never have I ever farted. Well, laughing

Speaker 2:          01:36          one, two, three,

Speaker 1:          01:40          I, I don't remember. Like I know like if I would have done it, I would've never forgotten because I would have paid as myself so much. So since I don't have any memories of that, I'd probably not.

Speaker 2:          01:50          That's the kind of things that happens, like not a one time thing, you know, it happens. So never have I ever wanted to be famous.

Speaker 1:          02:07          So I want to create like really good work and I want to be like the best I possibly can in my profession. But I'm scared of people getting too involved with me. Like I still want to be able to go and flip flops to the supermarket and no one caring about that. So,

Speaker 2:          02:23          and know me, it's like years ago in like, I'm working as a model and I wanted to get to get famous more. Cause I think I said to I and then of course you know by the understanding and with the years, you know you're not like searching for this kind of things no more, but when you are very young he won this kind of things.

Speaker 1:          02:41          Yes sir. No people have the wrong idea about modeling and makeup.

Speaker 2:          02:47          Ooh

Speaker 1:          02:49          Yes. Oh yes. Oh you want to go first. Sometimes people think that makeup is something that's superficial that has to with vanity and it's not true. For example, in my case, makeup artistry is like painting, drawing, sculpting, et cetera. But instead of having a blank canvas, your canvas is a human being. So you are creating a living and a moving work of art and that takes a lot of time and that takes a lot of effort. But makeup can also transform a person's life. One time I had a client and either, no, like she had, she had cancer. When I finished doing her makeup, she look in the mirror and she said, today I don't feel sick. That's powerful. It can change the way a person sees themselves. That's why I believe that sometimes people have a wrong idea of makeup.

Speaker 2:          03:46          I think, you know, like four models mainly. We are also humans. You know what I mean? Oh, well we are human beings. And for me starting modeling was a way to escape. Uh, also my family. We are humans, you know? Okay. So never have I ever been jealous. A few. Um,

Speaker 3:          04:15          oh,

Speaker 1:          04:16          oh you, you want to, you want to know why it's not now, but when I met you, so this is like a very dark topic. When I met you, uh, I used to suffer from, from like self image issues and eating disorders and I saw you and I was like, I wish I were a skinny as her. And that's what I was, the only thing I wanted back then I only wanted to be skinny and I lost a lot of weight, a lot of weight. There came a point where I basically, I was eating too little, I was eating too little and I thought that was okay. And I was like sic row and it was the skinniest person in the world and I was so happy. And then I got sick. I felt so bad because I was like, I thought this was going to make me happy and I thought that this was like the ideal. Then my body is rejecting this weight, my buddy is rejecting this lifestyle and this behavior and I analyze like my priority should be my health no matter what and I'm healthy now. And I'm like, Oh my God, you look so pretty. You look so full of life. And I'm like still trying to accept it. You know? It's not easy, but at least, at least now I'm like, this is the right thing. This is the right thing. So yeah, that's basically what happened. And I'm so glad that I finally could grow out of that.

Speaker 2:          05:44          Yeah, I'm glad. Yeah, because you're shining, you don't need to to be less. You'd be just to be you and a half has no price. You know what I mean? Yeah. I had exactly the same one. I was very young, I was 15 and I was, I was probably a seeking for attention or I don't know what I was exactly seeking for. I had troubles with my mom and I try with my father and my stepmother was extremely controlling, manipulative and all that. I was terrible. I think what we all want all to be so skinny and blah blah. But I think we are trying to to, I don't know, there's a name motional problem. There isn't a problem inside of us, you know, and I'm, I'm happy that you accept yourself the way you are. I had to accept myself and when I accepted I, everything was okay.

Speaker 1:          06:34          The next one, yes or no, I mess up a lot.

Speaker 3:          06:41          Okay. Yes,

Speaker 2:          06:44          of course. Yes. And we learn about an hour messing up basically from all what we are doing. Yes. And we learn, we learn willow.

Speaker 1:          06:54          I feel that I take a lot of risks in my life. Like I do a lot of things that are very risky and it's not always going to end up how you want it to and it's not always going to end up well.

Speaker 2:          07:06          Yeah, I miss a ball. So because I put myself in in really dangerous situations, you know, like I went to Panama like this, you know, I know that I invest a lot also in people. I get emotionally invested a lot. I get heartbroken, but you know what I lived with, I had to leave and live it to the fullest. I live at 100% so yes, I miss a lot, but it's, my life is like really full and I really love. Exactly. You know what I mean? Exactly. Oh my God. Yay for them. That is so yes or know your partner knows how truly amazing they are. Yes or no. That's

Speaker 3:          07:48          Si.

Speaker 1:          07:53          Yeah. I think, you know, I feel that you know how amazing you are because you've been through so much. It doesn't matter how hard it is, you always choose you. So you always see, know how amazing you are and how much you were worth. And I really admire and respect that of you because like in my case, it took me forever to really choose me,

Speaker 2:          08:14          but for me too, it takes me forever. You know, it's not a mall little by little, but um, yeah, I know that you, you know, so, oh, how amazing you are. You're very positive. It's hard to find positive people. Trust me.

Speaker 1:          08:30          No, and it was hard for me to be like five years ago. People wouldn't say that of me. Like I used to be really, really depressed and really anxious. Yeah. And I, it makes me really happy that a person that, that found me like later in the future would see me this way because it means that I truly have changed and that's everything that I ever worked for. I'm glad I met you.

Speaker 4:          08:57          Yeah, me too.
