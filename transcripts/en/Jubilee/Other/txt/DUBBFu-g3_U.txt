Speaker 2:          00:01          My name is Donovan McNabb. Since 2001 the Donovan McNabb foundation has continued to spread the awareness of diabetes. Diabetes is something that's continued to drastically terror the lives of some of our individuals. The high percentage of of individuals are passing away from their families and their loved ones. We need to go out and find the cure for this particular disease. Obesity is something that obviously adds into a diabetes. Being overweight, putting the wrong foods until your system. I think we can eliminate that. Diabetes is continued to grow over the years with all of us come together. We can continue to make a change. Let's work together to end child obesity. Let's invest in our nation's youth.
