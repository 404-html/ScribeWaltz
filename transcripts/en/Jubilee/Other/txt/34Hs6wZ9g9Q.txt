Speaker 1:          00:01          Hey,

Speaker 2:          00:06          so this was the big issue that Julie probably has ever had. We had about 40 crew members over 80 cast members. Um, and it was just absolutely insane. I was insanely fun for all of the sand. It was just such a humbling experience to be able to work with such talented, um, and amazing people. Um, honestly, this film could not have been possible without my amazing team. This is a very deeply personal story for me. Um, and it's something that I care so much about and I am so humbled and appreciative of everyone who were able to come together or we just feel really fortunate because jubilee project came to, I get the opportunity to have the stories Alzheimer's disease told through their wonderful work. So our hope is that it'll continue to raise awareness and raise involvement, hit more people drawn to our services and more people supporting the word.

Speaker 3:          01:07          Uh, my name's Jason Today. I am the one eight D, which means I'm the main person on set and screams at everyone as how's or one that they're late and behind schedule. This is my angry face when we're behind on time. Hi, I'm Rachel. I am the, it's been a good student so far. Everybody has been super on top of things and really, really well behaved, very talented. So it has been a very easy process to work with everybody. You have a great, fantastic, great crew, great parents, um, people really willing to open up locations for us. And there's a good time,

Speaker 2:          01:51          Rachel, first time producing a film, but I had a great director to work easy. Come on please. They cast and crew there is, she got so many compliments about how organized this production was and like people who've been on sets for really, really long time. Like Joe Joe said that this is really organized of all the films I've worked on, this was the most organized. Wow.

Speaker 3:          02:20          I am Robert. I am the gaffer. I am doing pretty much all of the lighting, setting up all the lighting here. And uh, it's a smaller crew. So you said there's no grip. So, uh, some kind of doing the grip department and the electric department with Marshall DP, obviously they are just evil. No slave labor work 50 hours a day, um, as as well possible because you can see by this kids they were all wiped out. A very big thank you to yes style.com for sponsoring. Um, all this amazing clothing. Um, you guys really came through. I had so much fun going through your site and you're picking out some awesome pieces for our after Joe. We really wanted him to look refined, dapper and have a little bit of personality in this club performance has been unreal. Um, both, uh, Joe and today I had just really comes in body.

Speaker 3:          03:48          Their character. They're no longer actors. They are Arthur and the melody. So this is pretty much my first acting sharp. How do you like it? I love it. Do you like the character melody? Yes. What do you like about her? She seems very nice and she cares a lot for grandpa and I also always like, like characters dance. I started dancing like training when I was seven years old, but my mom put me in classes since I was three. Makes me feel good, especially better. Amber. Maybe I had a bad day. Sometimes I just, I think everybody should dance because it makes everybody feel better. And it's a way to express your emotions through movement and exercise.

Speaker 3:          04:53          What was it like working with surveyor? We hit it off. We had a good time. How many she was trying to braid my hair today. You saw, why did it make me look like a Unicorn? But no, she's great. She's a great little actress and a great person. She really is. And I think it's important to show how a child react in it showed her in a very positive light helping your grandfather and it showed a love between two generations, did it pretty far apart. It can really work if you love each other. Oh sweet. The worst part is when you feel like you did it right and it says miss also, uh, go back to go box right now, the crew and cast that we worked with those your first phone. Thank you. You were so good and you're awesome fun and really grateful for being a part of it. So this story is inspired by my grandfather. My grandfather raised me when I was

Speaker 2:          08:55          just the baby because my parents were, um, out of the country working. And so I grew really close with them, but he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's, uh, several years ago and he got to a point where he no longer even recognize me anymore. Um, and so I didn't really know how to respond. I essentially just kind of ran away from him, even stopped caring for him until one day. Um, we're just sitting in the same room and I hear him mumbling and I lean in closer. And what I heard was this absolutely amazing story that he was trying to tell me about the time that he was fighting this war and in 1940 [inaudible] and using, being pushed down into the south end to these caves and had nowhere else to turn. And I was amazed. I was stunned. I was like, wow, this is my grandfather who, you know, can't even remember what he had for dinner the night before, but being able to share this really rich and personal history that he had many decades ago.

Speaker 2:          09:53          And that was really the turning point in which I saw him as a different person as my grandfather again. And that taught me a lot about him, um, about someone with Alzheimer's, even though they lost their memories, they still have capacity to feel love and their emotions outlast their memories. Ultimately, the main takeaway for this film is to live what you love. For every one of us, um, we have that passion. We have that drive that really makes us come alive. And so that's why I believe that ultimately this is a story about love. Um, and it's important to live what you love, um, because that's what at the end of the day truly helps us come alive. And that's what melody and Arthur to do for each other. What happens is

Speaker 4:          10:44          this, this dance scene is the last scene of a film in which the granddaughter, her name is melody, is on the stage and she's dancing in the talent show, but she ends up messing up and she falls in the grounds. And what happens is the Grandpa to show her his support stands up in the audience and search the stance. And, and slowly one by one different groups of people will start joining him as this, as a sign of solidarity
