Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:05          in 1997 a psychologists conducted an experiment that could lead any two people to fall in love using just 36 questions. We took those 36 questions and ask them to three complete strangers

Speaker 1:          00:20          just to see what happens. Tell refreshing. All right. When did you last sing to yourself? I sing all the time, so I see you too. My girlfriend,

Speaker 2:          01:02          my homie in Georgia, the first school hang man, she just go nuts. Romantic. I wish I had that talent. The thing to my girlfriend, she called me on the phone. They love it. Whatever you do, they love it. That's great.

Speaker 1:          01:21          All right.

Speaker 2:          01:28          What is the greatest accomplishment of your life?

Speaker 2:          01:32          I would say the greatest accomplishment of my life is being able to reach my dream of being a pro wrestler around eight years old. Um, you know, I discovered professional wrestling and I was glued to the television. Um, my father was abusive, you know, I didn't have a father figure, so the people that I watched on TV were like my heroes and right then I knew that one day I wanted to be a professional wrestler. That was my dream. I developed a fan base of a lot of children that don't have like a father figure. Being able to do that for kids. Um, it's really important to me.

Speaker 1:          02:07          Okay. Two doors and we see it without them. There would be no change in me. I was just wild and crazy when I was young. Um, and so I was a bad kid, honestly afraid of nothing. Talk to security. I'm like eight, nine, just like what is wrong with you? And so that's a lack of love. And so not having a father and a mom to really love you. But yeah, just my daughters, when they came to soften me, I was combing their hair and picking out clothes, wearing dresses and for them to make them smile. And that was the greatest accomplishment of all the things that I've done. I respect you for that man. Yes, I would say for myself is the greatest accomplishment. It would definitely be as a trainer,

Speaker 3:          03:00          like being with actually change someone's life in a positive way. Growing up I was like very skinny kid and um, I was bullied a lot. And so I was pretty, I was an angry person and so I just started training my room and it became something that I realized was much more positive than breaking things. It's amazing, man. Thank you. That's amazing.

Speaker 2:          03:23          You guys are very genuine. I'm really, I really do it

Speaker 3:          03:26          Myra you for that. Thank you very much. You're welcome. Thank you. What is your most terrible memory?

Speaker 1:          03:37          Oh,

Speaker 3:          03:39          I can go first. I was playing tennis. I hit a ball and it hit on the bullies. Um, I remember him jumping behind me and strangling me. There were people around me and, uh, instead of like standing out for me, everyone was just laughing, uh, ridiculing me while it was like being strangled and choked on the ground. It was just a time where I really was just going through a lot of mental battles. That was the time where I would contemplate oftentimes like suicidal thoughts at times. And so I would say that is like probably one of the more terrible memories from alive. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          04:21          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          04:22          Um, one of my most terrible memories is when I was 16, I was shoplifting because all the kids at school are wearing like all the fancy clothes, like Nautica and Tommy Hilfiger. And I wanted to be cool, but we didn't have money so I would steal clothes and I got caught. I was only 16 years old. I didn't know what to expect and I was like crying and everything. The security guard called my grandparents and they were really disappointed in me. And then they put me in juvenile hall for a month. That was the scariest experience of my life. I realized that I need to change my life. So I stopped stealing, never stole again. So I think we have our terrible memories for a reason to teach us and it allows us to grow stronger. They're just hurdles that we have to jump over.

Speaker 1:          05:04          Mine is been sick for like 12 years and I was just depressed seeing everyone smile and happy. And here I am taking four or five naps a day trying to survive, losing jobs. And, uh, you never say, why do you need, and you'd say, why do you need what you're actually saying? Why not her or him give that to her? And that's not fair. So why not you? What roles do love and affection, play? Love. That word could change someone's life. I just learned to say I love you. And that was recently I told my nephew that I love and he cried because his father, they did some studies who they spoke to, snow floods and one that is current stack the snowflake. It's just terrible looking and wanted. They spoke love to. It's just so beautiful and it never changed. So that's what happens when you speak life into people and will you help them raise your vibrations in your energy? I love that sense.

Speaker 2:          06:15          Totally agree with that. Life is all about love. It's okay for a man to have affection and show affection. It doesn't make him weak at all. It's not unmanly for Amanda cry. I've always been an emotional person. So like if a wrestler has to retire or someone that I really looked up to watching the TV, watching them make their speech, I've shed tears, you know, to that like, so things like that, you know, we were given those tiers for a reason. How do you feel about it,

Speaker 1:          06:43          your relationship with your mother? Obviously like I said, I didn't have one, but people say I talk like her. Um, she was a humanitarian basis. She spoke wise and she was involved with the community. That's all she cared about. So I just try to harm her.

Speaker 2:          07:03          My story with my mother is very touching. It's sad. Um, I'm proud of her in some ways, but I'm also disappointed in other ways. You know, she was a single mom and she was using drugs as we were growing up. She wasn't there very much, but I know she loved us, but it just, she had outside influences from the men that she was bringing in. We were evicted out of our house when I was 19 years old. Um, I ended up taking care of my 12 year old brother and then my mom ended up homeless. My mom was homeless for 10 years and unfortunately it's hard to help people that really don't want the help. You know, she went to a Rehab facility and she got off drugs for a little bit, but then she relapsed and got back along and it was very, very frustrating and there was a period of time we're writing communicate with her and right now she's trying to get her life back in order. I love my mom. I'm just praying and I'm hoping that she can stay clean and I just wanted to know that I do love her

Speaker 3:          08:05          just because our F my own family dynamic is something I, I don't generally share with the public. I know she loves me and you know, we love, I love her too, but it's very challenging to communicate. And um, and that is what I will say for that complete this sentence. I wish I had someone with whom I could share life. I would say I'm single right now. So this is something that, um, I don't know if I'm like really searching for it right now yet. Uh, but I think definitely in the future or would like to be able to share life with someone. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          08:48          you'll get it. I believe that sometimes it comes to you when you least expect it. And that's what I learned. The universe handled that

Speaker 1:          08:57          like with mine came last year. It wasn't exciting nervous, it's just she just came along. She was really, she was so, yeah, you can't look forward. It's kind of the universe will do the work. It's like a mailman when you put a letter in the mailbox, right. You don't go keep, you don't go to that mailbox everyday or to the and say, hey, did you met with my letter off? It's the PostNet his job now. So do it and leave it alone if it's four years going to happen. And that's how relationships are too. Hmm. Yeah. So, well, I would say someone who I can grow with substantially in many aspects of life.

Speaker 2:          09:48          I think the perfect woman that most people would agree with would be someone that's supportive, is motivating you can grow with and that you can learn from someone with a great personality and a determination and a drive and a woman that is also independent as well and that will support you and what you want to do and that will always listen to you and that somebody that you can confide in. Yeah, I believe that would make up a perfect woman.

Speaker 1:          10:14          Okay. There is no terrific women, no man, whatever comes to you and it agrees with chest spirit. Yes. Your twin flame, that's perfect because everybody's not going to understand you. You guys can be the panda helmets when you're riding motorcycles. That's perfection. There's personally cause you guys invited. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          10:38          Man, that's a great thing about you as you can really put things into perspective. Definitely. Thank you. Tell the other two what you like about them. Be Very honest this time saying things that you might not say to someone you've just met. What I admire about you is how honest you are. Um, you offer amazing perspective on everything. Um, you seem very spiritual and comfortable with who you are as a person and who have you grown into. And then for you, your life story is amazing. What you've been through and how you overcame the bullying and everything. Um, I really admire that about you. Thank you very much. You're welcome.

Speaker 1:          11:20          Yeah, I will say that about you too. Cause hurt people usually hurt people and we didn't take that route. So that's commendable. Your whole aura five is peaceful. You can't keep a piece without chaos. All of the chaos in your life has given you peace. That's beautiful man. I would say one thing I really admired about you right now, you're very insightful. Like what you said earlier about why me. Right? And that was kind of like, wow. Yeah, I mean, yeah, I really admire your vulnerability. You being able to share those challenging circumstances in life and it's an honor to be here, both of you, both of you guys at kings, you know, for lunch he'd been through and like I said, you can lead a war. You can lead an army. Maybe you don't think so. The, all the things that you been prepared for your whole life prepared you for. You can't become a shot in master unless you go through the training. I think they spiked it actually. Oh, did they? That's it.
