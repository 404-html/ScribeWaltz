Speaker 1:          00:00          Every day, youtube receives over 2 billion views. Imagine if just 1% of those views inspired people to do good. Now imagine if one penny was donated for each of those fuse. Enter the jubilee project. For every video we make, we recruit sponsors to donate a penny for each view the video receives. So by simply watching the video, you're not only learning about the issue, but also helping to raise money for a cause. But we can't stop there. Our vision is to create an online hub for nonprofit organizations to raise funds, spread awareness, and share best practices through their own inspiring videos. Verizon's $5,000 grants. We'll make the realization of our vision possible and through their wireless technology people around the world, we'll be able to stream these videos, raise money for nonprofit organizations, and make a lasting impact around the world. After all, did you believe project beliefs that doing good is contagious?
