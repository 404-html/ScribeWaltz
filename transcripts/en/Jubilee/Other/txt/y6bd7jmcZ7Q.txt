Yeah. I want to like almost pee my pants when I think people from laughter. Yeah. Not from incontinence. Um, okay. What do you values? Um, just someone who's

Speaker 3:          03:00          chill with being themselves with you. It's so nice.

Speaker 1:          03:03          Honesty and giggles. Yeah. Yeah. Those two ingredients, that's all you need. How do you feel about your relationship with your mother? I love her. Yeah. Good. She is awesome. She's so kind and I wish you lived closer. Yeah, I know that feeling. Okay. I have two moms. My older, my mom be, she is the kind of person that everybody loves. We automatically, she's like gregarious and like bright. And then my mom and my younger one is my birth mom. And what is her name? If she's, she's just mom. There's mom and mom. Mom. Yeah. She is like a genius. He's really good at fixing things herself and she's the kind of person who makes a lot of sacrifices for other people, like, you know, how did they meet with them on a blind date? Incredible.

Speaker 3:          04:03          Name three things you and your partner appear to have in common.

Speaker 1:          04:09          Okay. Let's talk about, look at the striped shirt. Black Pants. So Alvin is checked off. We are in arts in true, we both would love to relax with coffee and that's a great one. That's like a very solid, yeah, yeah, yeah. All right, next one then. Oh Lord, what is true love. Okay. Okay.

Speaker 3:          04:45          My current understanding of what true love might be, it's just finding someone you can be your full self with all the goods and the bads.

Speaker 1:          04:55          I totally agree. It's like having an extension of yourself. You have to live with all of the good and bads in you. Right. And when you can like fully accept that in somebody else and like be supported by them and support them through anything, that's true. Laughs. All right. Share a personal problem and ask your partners advice on how she might handle it. Okay. Ah, okay.

Speaker 3:          05:22          No problem. And I've got a few. Gosh, my biggest issue right now, it's sort of funding the balance between working a super demanding job. Also finding time to simultaneously pursue my own creative projects. So hard. Finding that balance is my problem right now.

Speaker 1:          05:48          That's a very hard one. Yeah. And I'm supposed to give you advice. Right? I guess, I don't know. I think you're doing a very normal struggle, struggling like that. It's only going to make you stronger. Um, okay. Your personal style problem you took mine, you can have the same problem and I can relate the same information. I feel like it's in the exact same vein. Okay. But my personal problem is that I'm worried that I don't have quite enough direction in what I'm doing and I'm worried that I'm floundering. Sometimes it like crosses my mind that like maybe I'm not working toward any goal right now.

Speaker 3:          06:34          That's so common for people pursuing creative paths in any short. But in terms of not having enough direction, I'm sure that you do, but I think just like finding the thing that you want to say to the world that only you could say and sharing that through your work.

Speaker 1:          06:54          Oh, how do you do? I'm working on it myself, but

Speaker 3:          07:01          you of course have things that are important to you and sort of putting those out proudly and whatever artistic shape that takes and standing by it. And I know you can do that. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          07:14          Oh, thanks. It's all about I want to see your work and your performances. Yes, we will. We can make this continue. All right. This might be the final question. Done. Oh, what'd you go on a second date with your partner? Yes. Yeah. Sounds good. Already reached this conclusion. We'll make this other thing. I want to high five you again, but it's like we can do it. Let's do it. Okay. To good high fives today. Were you looking at elbow? I was looking for that. Good day. That's a wrap, folks. We did it.
