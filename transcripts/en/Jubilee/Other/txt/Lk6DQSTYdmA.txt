Speaker 1:          00:00          Never have I ever kissed a girl it I wanted to know

Speaker 2:          00:13          up

Speaker 3:          00:14          [inaudible]. I'm Corey brothers or [inaudible]. My name's Rj. You've been rather it's for 18 right? 18 years. Now that I think about it, we don't talk as much, but like we get each other. All right. Never have I ever made you clean up my mess.

Speaker 1:          00:33          Hey, yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:39          Remember when your friend brought home like a BB gun and we're not allowed. We weren't allowed to shoot at the time. As I told Mom, knowing that she directly anger towards you because she was like, oh, you're the older brothers Lee out to like be a role model and stuff. Have you felt guilty about that? I think I should have got you in trouble, but I don't know. Time heals all wounds, dude. I said yes because I thought you meant like a literal messy room in some ways. I don't want you to take care of my mess if I can't be a good role model to you.

Speaker 2:          01:11          Then like

Speaker 3:          01:13          what's the point of me being your older brother? Biologically, I'm your older brother, but I want to be an older brother. You know,

Speaker 2:          01:19          okay.

Speaker 1:          01:21          Never have I ever, never have I ever done something to fit in very to what, what did you do to fit in?

Speaker 3:          01:29          So my friend was like, oh do you don't have in this kickback am I my house and stuff. Right. I didn't know what a kickback was. Right. So I want anyways. And I kinda like found out while I was there. I don't think of myself as wanting to succumb to like peer pressure. But I did that one time and it was, it was really stupid because like those aren't even like my actual friends, you know? It was just like a bunch of people I met that night. I know you're the older brother, but I'm still an older brother to like our sisters. I don't want to like be open with it. Right. All right. I didn't want to like tell you one of the family cause I know like stuff travels. Yes.

Speaker 1:          01:58          They understand that. Like it was something that you didn't want to do then. Yeah. But they don't have to know that. I don't think I've had something like yours. I think it was just back in middle school with my tight pants. Oh yeah. Uh, never. Have I ever lied to you? They a law. No surprise as I feel like I've lied to you and you knew it and then you lied to me. I knew it. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:20          I would always like come up with some like bullshit excuse that. Oh my, like rising turnout or something. So I need you try me when I actually just like totally forgot to ask you. Uh, uh, let's see. What have I lied to? I Dunno. I just feel like I just try and make myself sound better than I usually do.

Speaker 1:          02:44          Never have I ever been afraid of the future? Three to one. Pretty sure everyone our age is freaking out.

Speaker 3:          02:54          Going in a film, it's like, I don't really know what to do. I know a lot of people freelance. I was with my friend and he told me that the best way to get through, just to follow the rules, you have to be a doctor, engineer or business major. Right. Those are like social standards for kids like us. And when he told like said that to me, I was like super paranoid

Speaker 1:          03:13          when I got into USC is like sweet. I know the direction that I'm going in but I still have no idea like what I'm supposed to do. It's scary cause like mom and dad are investing in us so much like everyone that I've talked to, like it's the same thing like no one has it figured out.

Speaker 2:          03:28          Cool, cool, cool.

Speaker 1:          03:34          Never have I ever wanted to tell you something but didn't to spare your feelings? No. Countdown God. Well now okay. My bad feels quite awkward. I can't think of any. I mean it's all the same thing. I know you can do better, you know that kind of thing. Like there are things I wanted to tell you but like I knew you already felt it

Speaker 3:          03:57          up until now. For the longest time I thought you had everything like sorted out. Growing up with you, you are so optimistic about everything and there was never a time where I felt like I had to tell you something. A lot of the things I tell you anyways. It's just like it turns into like this like joke are. We just like laugh it off and it's like cool.

Speaker 1:          04:16          I'm like a role model to, you know, I look up with Jaylen, never have I ever felt like I disappointed you in three, two, one

Speaker 3:          04:33          wait, I still into your process. I need you. You took your first. It's like the same thing I've been saying like whenever mom yells at me or whenever I feel like I messed up, that's when I feel like I've disappointed you and Jaylen and Kina like I just wanted to be this big blanket for you guys to like be safe and I think when you left for college you left some like pretty big shoes to fill. You know what I mean? And it didn't feel as like super gradual. It just felt like all these responsibilities were dumped on me and it was like that expectation to be you like literally. Yeah and body, like your personality and mannerisms. Like, I don't want you to like come back and find out like her family's like super screwed up and stuff. You know what I mean? Yeah. Cause like you guys in shambles right now? No, I'm just kidding. We're great.

Speaker 1:          05:17          Is that a lie? Are you guys okay? Yeah, we're fine. Are you okay? Are you okay? I'm killing it here too. Yeah, I'm lit dude. We were just talking about you. Okay. The more you ask him, no more. I'm concerned like, I don't think I've talked to you as much. I just want to make sure that you're okay. Keep your top like here all the time. Okay. Okay. You guys okay? We're great. How do you feel?

Speaker 2:          05:43          Okay.

Speaker 3:          05:43          I feel like we've both felt this way. We just never like talked about it. It's like understandable. Like I don't expect them to talk to me about these kinds of things. We've known each other for 18 years now, so I can like understand you without having to like ask you or,

Speaker 1:          05:58          yeah. Talk about it. Hey, do you want him to play one more question? Okay. Never have I ever kissed the girl. I wanted to. No surprise. There were times when like I thought [inaudible]. He's like the ladies, man. I don't know how he gets all these girls. He's like the silent mysterious guy. I'm like, man, for the longest time I've always wanted to kiss, kiss the girl, Dude, you are incredible. Look at us coming together and watching the videos together. Such a family, right? Yeah.
