Speaker 1:          00:00          I love you because of your money. Yeah. $43. Can we go first? Yeah. Okay. So does that mean I think you fix her hair?

Speaker 2:          00:24          Uh, I think well first thing that comes to mind is just best friends. Exactly. Even though it's like the cheesiest thing in the world. Um, well I didn't think it was a real thing until we did it because we were actually best friends before, before we did it. Yeah. So it was just this weird like seamless transition thing. But um, I dunno. Weird. We're very weird. Yes. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:49          Can you hear me? I Hate Chicago. Okay. Yeah, no. See my very, very first impression of her, I thought she was really cute and she was super fun. But then my next impression of her was a few months later when I moved in with her best friend and that's when I like really got to know her. I don't like your haircut.

Speaker 2:          01:16          Sorry. You're saying something Sassy right now. So actually I hate telling us because it sounds so like gross and millennial, but the first time I ever saw him was on my snapchat story. It wasn't until like six months later maybe that he randomly moved in with my best friend. We just started hanging out as friends and became really, really good friends and it was just this super platonic thing. Um, well I told them when I first saw you, and it was on my friend's snapchat story, such a millennial news.

Speaker 1:          02:00          It was August 8th, 2016. Um, and we went to Sushi stop afterwards we walked to Gelson's and bought Oreos and then came back to my apartment and watched stranger things. I think our first date was a at Sushi stop. August 8th, uh, 20. What's this year? [inaudible] 16, I think. Yeah. And then we stopped into the grocery store right across the street, got a pack of Oreos and then went back to his place and watch stranger things. What'd you say? Oh, I said our first date was August 8th, 2016. Nice, Nice. Let's see if she stopped. Yeah. Did you tell him about the Oreos?

Speaker 2:          02:48          Okay, I'm glad I got the show right. Wow.

Speaker 1:          02:52          Oh Man. I guess the first thing, she's so funny. Then she'll like, she'll be honest with you. She'll give you great advice and she'll

Speaker 3:          03:01          give you like advice to, to better you as a person.

Speaker 2:          03:05          Ah, I don't know. He is the nicest guy in the world. Um, he's really, uh, has no shame in just a way that's like, he is super, completely himself all the time, which is unreal and cool and I love that about him. And um, he makes me laugh. He's really funny, but I'm not going to tell him myself that because then he'll get cocky. So I said, you had no shame like in just being yourself wherever, whenever, which I think is cool.

Speaker 3:          03:44          Cool. I said you were super funny. Wow. First thing I said, I mean, so I said you were funny. Really don't just calm down. She has like seven Billy and red notifications on her phone and it didn't dry. Like I, if I have like one unread email I have to like get rid of it and she has like 6.5 million emails and like 48 notifications from some random APP. She now two ways. Um, but that's not, I mean, I dunno. It's like, you know, is anything, it is kind of funny. Um, but she's also a really great front seat driver and she gets a little nervous when I get close to cars and stuff like that.

Speaker 2:          04:33          He, this is just going to reflect poorly on me, but he just touches me way too much. But like his love language is physical touch and mine's do I get really hot really easily. So sometimes I'll just be sitting there like in my own sadness and hot, just this awful thing and, and he'll like come up and like try to like, you know, touch me or something like that and I'm like, you gotta stop it. You can't do that. This is another thing that's like a good thing. But he never gets angry. Just let it out sometimes. You know? Uh, we were on the way here and I was telling him like, who will sit in a lane of traffic that is not moving while the lane next to him is just zooming by because he's just like content with wherever he's at, which is great.

Speaker 3:          05:23          I, there was one part where I knew what you were saying. I'm hot touch you all the time. I knew it was my science. I said he touches me too much. I would just say, yeah. Uh, I said that you have like 60 billion unread notifications on your phone. It's true. God. And that doesn't mean that you're a fantastic front seat driver.

Speaker 2:          05:49          I told him you're not aggressive enough like rep rose. All right. I probably look bad because my thing was I was just complaining about things that are like good qualities to have

Speaker 1:          05:59          as a human being, you know? Oh, he's two functioning. He doesn't get angry, you know, like don't do it. But yeah,

Speaker 3:          06:11          wait a beat. Great. Stop.

Speaker 3:          06:17          Um, no, we, I mean we honestly really haven't had like a big fight or something like crazy, like scary thing or whatever in a previous relationship. Um, but I had been, someone had been disloyal to me to say politely and so I had like not, it wasn't, I wouldn't say trust issues, but I was like pretty insecure about and just other guys in general. And I would just, it was like in my head that something bad would happen if like she got too close to another guy or something like that. I think it was kind of a good thing that we like had these, you know, sometimes arguments or fights or whatever about like this insecurity that I had to get over. And you know, she was actually really great with it.

Speaker 2:          07:01          He had some trust issues at the beginning of the relationship. He didn't even, he was like, I don't want to be that guy. I don't, I don't, you know, I want you to hang out with your friends. I don't even care. But for some reason like it's bothering me and I can't, you know. And so that was just something we had to work through a little bit because I don't think I gave him enough grace in the beginning of that. Um, because I had a really hard time understanding why it was happening. I said when I was like annoying and

Speaker 1:          07:32          I said the same thing but not in those words. Nice. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          07:39          It's really truly almost hard to explain like everyone, like has this like ideal person and like, it's like a sheet of like kind of things you think you want in a person, um, or you think you need an a person. And then once you meet like the one that just exceeds all of those expectations and like every way possible. I just, I wake up every day, like truly want just wanting to be hers or be with her, hang out with her, spend time with her or you know, do something for her. I love who she makes me and I love who she is and, and how she makes me a better person. And just,

Speaker 1:          08:27          uh, it yourself, um,

Speaker 3:          08:35          who have like, no, he's gonna make it worse. Uh, yeah, this start to finish. She's like as perfect as you could get for me. And that includes all of her, her flaws and her accepting single one of my flaws and me for everything that I am, I can never find someone like her. I don't think there's anyone better out there for me.

Speaker 2:          09:05          So I never have to be afraid of introducing them to someone because I know that they're going to like him because everyone does. Gosh, he's just so sweet and caring and loving, like just so loving, you know, so much so that I get annoyed by it sometimes, but he really wants me to love myself, really shows me how I now believe I deserve to be loved. I don't know. I just, I'm so bad though.

Speaker 4:          09:48          Uh, but you know, he, he's so good. Okay. I'm done now. I can't, I can't do this anymore. It freaks you out. Okay. You're done now.

Speaker 1:          10:02          So what'd you say? I said that I love you because of your money. Yeah. $43. Nice honey. I said, I said, I, uh, I love you because you're, um, I love it

Speaker 2:          10:22          cause you're such a good person and I never have to worry about introducing you to people because everybody loves you

Speaker 1:          10:28          and just

Speaker 2:          10:31          how well you love me and how well you show me

Speaker 1:          10:36          how to love myself. And um, I don't know. You're just God's gift to the world. I guess

Speaker 3:          10:47          everyone has this like sheet of like boxes that kind of you think need to be checked in, like someone that, whether it's like a type or like physically or emotionally or mentally or whatever personality wise, and just like meeting you was like exceeding all those expectations and you almost like don't know what to do with it. Bottom line. I'm great. Yes, exactly.

Speaker 1:          11:08          Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, yeah. You're a funny guy. Thanks brother. All right. Sorry, I'm the battle. Ooh, sick.
