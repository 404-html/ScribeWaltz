Speaker 1:          00:00          The only thing I ever really wanted in my life was to be a mother. That's the one thing I didn't get to them.

Speaker 1:          00:16          It was 24. I woke up one morning and my bed was completely soaked and I thought I'd peed the bed. I was four and a half months pregnant, but when I called the doctor, he had me come in and my amniotic sac and broken, I didn't know what to do. I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep and I couldn't stop crying because nobody tells you when you're young. There's a 20% chance that you could have a miscarriage. My marriage didn't work out. A lot had to do with how hard it is for a marriage to lose a child. So that was my first miscarriage and I moved to Mexico and I got married again. I got pregnant again and I knew enough to double check because I'd had a miscarriage. So I went in and they told me that, um, I had what's called an incompetent cervix and that just means that your cervix doesn't stay shut.

Speaker 1:          01:17          That was pregnant for five months. The doctor said to me as I was miscarrying, have you had an abortion? Pretty much insinuating that maybe it was my fault that I was having these problems. That was 1995 and in 1996 I got pregnant again with my daughter, feral, feral. Alma means wild soul, and I was pregnant five and a half months. Every time it got to be a little bit more. So the next time when I went in and I knew I was going to lose Pharrell, I refused to let the baby out until they promised to let me see her. I moved again and I was living in the Caribbean and in 1998 I got pregnant with Aiden and somehow I knew it was a boy from the beginning, so I had already named Aiden means fiery one, and my husband had already left. By the time I found out it was pregnant, he'd already decided he wasn't going to stay, even though I'd already had three miscarriages and I knew that being pregnant was a risk for me and both physically and emotionally I couldn't. I couldn't not try. When you're pregnant you can't help but hope, hope you imagine what your child will do and the things that they'll have. B and I didn't tell anyone I was pregnant because I thought for sure that I wouldn't be able to keep the baby when the doctor told me that I should not work and I refused and I thought that if I didn't give everything of myself up and I kept working, that if it didn't work out

Speaker 1:          03:33          might not hurt so much and I was six months pregnant and I was getting my regular checkups. I was excited and the doctor let me know that something was wrong with Aiden. My son had a rare genetic disorder. They'd caused his kidney's not the function properly. It was going to toxify my system and there was a high risk that I would die. I needed to terminate the pregnancy because the baby was going to suffocate in utero and I was dead. I went to see a specialist that I had seen before and they told me the same thing. He wouldn't be able to survive and they just didn't even want me to leave. They wanted me to just take care of it right there and I refused. I didn't care. I wanted so bad that there was something that they could do to save my son and I was willing to die for that, but I couldn't, that wasn't going to fix the problem.

Speaker 2:          04:48          Okay.

Speaker 1:          04:48          It didn't matter what I was willing to give up. My Mother didn't know what to do. She was a nurse and she still didn't know what to say. So I left him, take my stitches out and they induced labor.

Speaker 1:          05:06          When I made the decision that I would let the doctors do what they wanted, I felt so guilty. I felt like I was giving up my child. I don't really can't think of anything worse to do. I remember thinking that I wish that my labor more, I just wanted to feel something because I felt so numb and Aiden was born and they had forgotten to tell me that he would be alive. He was considered a live birth, so they had to wait and you know, do all the things you do to a new baby and then they wrapped him up. When they placed Aiden on my chest, he was struggling and I heard his prayer. It felt like funder to me. It was definitely wanted him to open his eyes so bad. I want it to be able to look in her eyes. No, but he was loved. I need for life for about an hour and 40 minutes. He took his last breath.

Speaker 1:          06:41          I felt like my heart stopped and I had him cremated and I feel back to the Caribbean and I sat in the closet in my room and cry. There was nothing to do to come from me. It's one of those things I'm like, but there's nothing to be sad. There's nothing that's going to make it better for so many years afterwards I would go to visualizations or meditations or anything to try to be a better person. A lot of times they'll tell you to visualize your, you know, your pelvic bowl, your girdle as like this golden orb of light. And for many, many years what I imagined it was bio waste and something gone rotten. I guess that's how I thought of my womb. I think maybe the truth is I have never fully grieved hidden.

Speaker 1:          07:48          Maybe that's why I'm here today. Almost 20 years later, I've been very lucky. I have a lot of nieces and nephews and I run a nonprofit that provides arts education to children, and I get to use all my skills and something I'm really passionate about. So I came today to celebrate my four children and honor them, and maybe the owner, the 10 years of my life I spent invested in that. Most people in my life don't even know that I've been pregnant four times, but every once in awhile I get a mother's Day card. Someone who knows me and loves me, and it's beautiful and painful at the same time.
