Speaker 1:          00:00          Asian stereotypes and jokes are so played out. It's the same shit that we've heard for the last 50 years. Like miss me with that. It's so boring. It, yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:08          This point,

Speaker 1:          00:28          is it better than mirror

Speaker 3:          00:31          three two no.

Speaker 1:          00:42          Wait, describe American food though. I just, I just thought of hamburgers and like a loaf and meatloaf and mashed potatoes and stuff. So I'm like, of course Asian foods better than that. I was just denied Asian food for a long time. My mom wanted to be Caucasian. She wanted me to grow up as a white person and I think I was maybe 10 or 11 when I truly like experienced Korean cuisine. Oh my God, this is amazing.

Speaker 4:          01:10          What's she saying? I find a really common cause when I grew up, you know, I, my parents were boat people from Vietnam. Like they wanted us to assimilate as much as possible and not be made fun of. So I love Asian food too. I am, but I'm from Texas, so I grew up in like chicken fried steak and biscuits and all kinds of stuff. So I fucking love marriage.

Speaker 1:          01:32          Wow.

Speaker 3:          01:34          Three, two. Wow.

Speaker 1:          01:44          My Dad doesn't care. He's happy no matter if I'm happy. My mom never specifically said it, but it was almost like if I don't bring home a Korean or a Caucasian, which is her preference, like I don't know if she's going to disown me. I don't know what will she kind of push away a little bit from me and I don't want that. My parents, at one point in time, we're very happy like you need to marry like a Vietnamese person, but as I got older, I understood why for them, because it's more about we just wanna be able to relate to the person that you're actually with so we can talk to them too. For me, it's really interesting because I'm actually married to a black woman. I'm Chinese Malaysian, but I grew up with a white father, like white people were definitely always an option, but then you know other groups of people, it's like, well, we're not really sure that they're like that. Great. That often seems to be the case. It's like you can date white or Asian and and everyone else off the table for some reason.

Speaker 2:          02:43          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:43          Asian stereotypes are three. Two wow

Speaker 1:          02:55          are funny. I like, oh wait, somewhat disagree. We're not judging you. Making in your head during my head is

Speaker 5:          03:07          like stereotypes are a reflection of perceived behavior and also I write comedy and so I'm constantly thinking of ways to maybe subvert a stereotype to get a laugh. I feel like it's always dangerous though because you never know if the joke is going to be perceived as like, oh they're making fun of the stereotype or the reinforcing the stereo

Speaker 1:          03:33          tight, but even then you're saying like the stereotype itself is not funny, but you're some version of it is okay, so maybe I'll move down. See I think I'm just like tired of like Asian stereotypes and jokes are so played out. It's the same shit that we've heard for the last 50 years and like American culture than like miss me with that. It's so boring at this point. I don't find it funny. Well, I totally understand from another point of view how that's absolutely inappropriate for from a personal level. I'm not offended, I'm not hurt. Some of them are like, yeah, that's kind of true. What's an example? I guess? Yeah, actually I might move again.

Speaker 5:          04:17          You don't like for instance me as a Korean, like if I were to say something about like how I feel like a lot of Koreans behave like Koreans love uh, k pop like boy bands. It could be funny and it's not necessarily an offensive stereo

Speaker 1:          04:33          but the growing up with like Asian men have small penises and they'll all sorts of other emasculating kind of stereotypes. Those kinds of stereotypes play into like why can't I be the love interest because I have a small penis but I don't actually know that. And why does it matter? Well you're talking about is like a stereotype. It's been put upon Asians by non Asians. If we agents want to talk about like subcultures and Asia and like make fun of shit totally down. Might find it funny to see how the joke is totally. I guess like when you say when, when the statement is Asian stereotypes are funny. I'm often thinking western stereotypes about Asians. I'm like no, it's not funny. Okay. Asian people easier.

Speaker 3:          05:16          Three. Two.

Speaker 1:          05:18          Why?

Speaker 1:          05:25          When did you say it has an easier, I think at discounts in the amount of work that's gone into building, building those communities. Are People working up towards, you know, becoming professionals or white collar professionals? Like I don't think they have Asians have it easier. I think many Asians have just fought harder. I don't, I'm not saying the other communities don't. I just think that I think they have earned it. I think that part of like how white supremacy works to kind of like cover up is they say like, well if this one group of minorities is doing well then there can't be racism in this country. We as Asian Americans have to understand that we are props for white supremacy. When we buy into the idea that all of this stuff that we've gotten is purely through our hardware. I do think Asians who have an easier, just because we're not portrayed so negatively. Yeah, we don't have as many like overtly negative stereotypes that are like thrown at us. You know?

Speaker 5:          06:22          I mean like you look at immigration and like nobody's freaking out about Asians coming into the country, which I feel like it's just been interesting to me to see you, especially also like Asian Americans that are okay with it because it's not them right now. And that sense I'm like, oh, we must have it easier because we're not concerned about what's happening to other people.

Speaker 3:          06:50          Three, two, one

Speaker 5:          06:59          super conflicted on this one.

Speaker 6:          07:04          I went to the motherland, um, maybe like five years ago and I thought that it was just going to be like so much fun and they were going to like be accepting and for the most part they are. But when I went there I realized like I'm not from here. Like it was really pretty obvious.

Speaker 1:          07:21          I mean I definitely want to connect to the culture that I was born into, but also a huge part of my identity is my queerness. And in Malaysia, Lgbtq people definitely don't have the same legal protections if they have any protections at all. And so that is painful to know that if I went back I wouldn't be accepted. It's a funny thing that happens when I go back to China. Just like the feeling that I never get here, which is like when you walk onto a public street you feel like you're not identified by what you look like, which is amazing. But that being said, like I feel culturally I'm American, I love being here and I think that being like an individual with freedom is like part of who I am in the sense that I wouldn't necessarily fit in in China. And I feel like so much of the time we're like asked to be like, well, are you Asian? Are you American? It's like, no, like I'm Asian American. I don't think we have to be that for this. Is it

Speaker 3:          08:19          three, two, one?

Speaker 5:          08:29          Yeah, it's important to me.

Speaker 1:          08:33          No, it's okay. We just want to know what you think. Yeah,

Speaker 5:          08:38          I mean like I think I think about this a lot is like sometimes I get thin, I'm Asian and then like it's kind of jarring to being reminded than I am. And so like

Speaker 6:          08:53          were you raised like with strong cultural

Speaker 5:          08:56          values and stuff? I was raised, I'm a military brat and so even though I grew up in Korea, it was on the military base and so it was like an American, a high school in like a small American city in the middle looks song. Me and my brother were usually the only Asian kids. So I remember kind of like do I want to stand out as like the only Asian kid or do I just want to be another one of the kids?

Speaker 4:          09:18          I think there can be balanced in that and that was the biggest problem I had growing up is that I didn't know I wanted to be American so bad. I just, I thought I had to choose a side and then eventually I was like, look, both are part of going him. But what his

Speaker 5:          09:31          further this

Speaker 4:          09:32          strongly agree part is I have a three year old child is half Chinese, half Vietnamese and I don't want him to live with the confusion that I grew up with.

Speaker 1:          09:41          For me like it actually, I feel a lot of pain still and a lot of grief because when we moved to the u s and you know this was like in a time still where you need to speak to your kids in English, they have to just know English and anything else will confuse them. So my mom stopped speaking to me and Haka and I forgot that language and we also didn't really celebrate any cultural traditions, you know, Chinese or Malaysian or Chinese Malaysian. I have no idea what that really is. And so, um, my culture is important to me, but I'm still like trying to find my way back to it. Like do you grow up? You're like socialized to fit in, right. And often means casting aside like the culture that you grew up in check, we're all experienced it to some degree of like, hey, should I like look into like where I came from more? It's a great thing if you can be proud of where you came from. I'm glad that we're connecting to that. That was so fun. That was interesting. Very, very, can I be friends with all of the ones?
