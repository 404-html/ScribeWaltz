A viral New York Times article featured 36 questions that could supposedly make any two people fall in love. We wanted to see what would happen if we ask these questions to two complete strangers on a blind date. I'm Danny. I am single. I've never really been in a relationship, but um, what I'm looking for an in person. I Dunno, just fun at this moment. I'm really scared actually, but like, excited, nervous. Hopefully my hands don't sweat or something.

Speaker 1:          00:46          Hi, I'm Danny. Andrew, nice to meet you too. I'm Andrew. I'm right now I'm just trying to meet people and you know, have a general idea of what type of person that would like to meet but not trying to put on any blinders and what can I TV like, um, peppermint. Peppermint is fun. Are you excited? I'm excited and nervous. Yeah, me too. Would you like to be famous and in what way? No, no. Never really. No, I don't think so. I feel like that would be like so much pressure to have to like be something for everyone. I think you'd have to be something for everyone when she, no, not really. I mean, I wouldn't, I wouldn't feel like obligated to be famous for, I don't know. Um, I guess be famous for myself or be famous for something I'm done. I brought value like a famous singer.

Speaker 1:          01:42          I mean, it'd be cool to be talented like that. Right. But um, no, I wouldn't want to change for people. I feel like obligated it be who they wanted me to be. If they like you, they like you. If they don't, they don't. Yeah, I get that it got some tea. Yeah, that'd be great. It's that Steve Know. I don't know if it is, does it taste pepper many at all? Is it just straight water? It's just nice warm water. You want to pour it back in or is that weird? Is that, I don't think so. It's going to go to all over or are you totally nervous too? Oh yeah. On like dying. Right. It's okay. If a crystal ball could tell you the truth about yourself, your life, the future, or anything else, what would you want to know? Hold on. I want to know.

Speaker 1:          02:28          I would want to know who and when I get married. Really? Yeah. You would want to know that. Yeah. That's cool. What about you? What would you want to know? I don't know that I'd want to know anything really. Yeah, like just being surprised by life and I wouldn't want to know when I was going to die. No, I get it. Like some people can sometimes, like if you know you're going to die, like you can really truly live because you know you've got like limited time, but I'm not sure I would choose that. Yeah. I think it would change too much how I would live. Like it wouldn't, you wouldn't really live. You would be so focused on like getting things done before. Yeah. Yeah. I'll let you ask that. My five. All right. I'm going to find a good one. Hence it doing this again. I'll see. Oh, there we go. There we go. Crashed it. I like your little sayings. Crushed it sick. It's really cool. It's very San Diego.

Speaker 1:          03:18          What roles do love and affection play in your life? Oh Gosh. Yeah. I think I get a lot of love and affection from like my family and my close friends. So I don't know. That's like a weird to ask. Like what roles did they play? Like a big one I guess for me cause I like right now I'm so new to La. Like I don't have anybody here yet. I know I will. But like what would be fun? I don't open up easy. No. It's hard for me to get team. Like it's not hard for me to get to know people. Like I get to know people really well and quickly, but it's hard for me to really get to know people. Like it takes a while. Exactly. Yeah, I get that. And I work all the time. So right now I'm a personal trainer. I work in Beverly Hills as a personal trainer. It's fun giving people to the point of where like they fall in love with themselves. That's better than they need us job. That's awesome. That's really cool. I like you're finding fulfillment in that too. Yeah. Cause like not a lot of people get to do that, you know, find fulfillment in their jobs and I'm young enough to where I can figure it out. Yeah, totally. What was the question? I don't remember

Speaker 2:          04:21          complete this sentence.

Speaker 1:          04:23          I wish I had someone with whom I can share like I want to just my life with. It's like somebody that is always there for you and you can like come home if you ever had a bad day at work and be like, this thing happened and they just kind of are there for you. The good and the bad thing. Like, yeah. What about you? Why cooking? Rarely. Oh my God. You Cook. I'm a huge cook. I cook all the time. What's your favorite food and chicken popper? Gosh, I saw Hungarian dish. I guess my dad's family was. Yeah, but it's like a chicken and like a pep Rica grabby or love pepper gun. It's so good. Yeah. I'm gonna have to figure it out. I can make it for you sometime. I'll be down. Let's do it. So cook off the we shut. That'd be fun.

Speaker 2:          05:13          Tell your partner something you like about them already?

Speaker 1:          05:16          Um, I feel like you have a very like, calming presence and I really enjoy that where it's like I'm not as stressed. That's good. Yeah. I'm super nervous so it doesn't really come off. I feel like. Yeah. I feel like my face is like seizing up because I'm so nervous. No, you seem very like chill and like that. Yeah. I was gonna say like you seem very like relaxed and easy going, which is not something I've run into in La at all. Really. Like after the first couple of weeks I was like not going give me them to be here. Like it's just gonna be hard. Yeah, you're very genuine. That's what it is. Okay. It's genuine. It was nice. Really. I don't know. Real, which is so hard because I feel like la is a city that worships everything and how I use nothing. Yeah. Gosh. Final task without speaking. Stare into each other's eyes for four minutes. Four minutes. That's a long time. Oh my gosh. Okay. We'll you for four minutes pretty easily. We can't talk while you're looking at each other for four minutes. It's a challenge. I'm always down for a child. Oh my God. I don't think anybody's ever looked at numbers. 40 minutes.

Speaker 3:          06:46          Yeah. Okay.

Speaker 1:          06:55          I was definitely really, really, really, really, really, really nervous and I got a lot less nervous and it was very different than I expected. She was really cool. She's like super pretty. I feel like a lot of it was, I was like, wow, this guy's really attractive. Sweet, down to Earth, just generally nice person. Then I was thinking, wow, nobody's ever looked at me this long or like this ever I think. And it felt really nice. I felt like everything she was was like real. Hmm. I like that.

Speaker 1:          07:55          That was a lot easier. It went so good. She's like, beautiful. So there's that and he's so nice. So I was like, really? That was really fun. They're probably gonna ask us like, what'd you go out again? But yeah. Should we run it for him? And I kind of expected it to be like, you guys want to go on a second date? Sure. Yeah, let's do it. And then like follow me on Instagram. Cool. Here's my handle. And then like never talk again like our pictures occasionally, but like I don't get a feeling like that is what's going to happen. So we'll see. I might be totally wrong. I've totally misread this, but we'll see. Do you want to go out again again? I would love to. Yeah. Um, I have a day off Saturday. I have Saturday off. You want to do something? Yeah, we say, okay, we should do the hike to the Hollywood sign. Oh yeah. I'm sorry. I feel like that's like a very like, hey, welcome to la thing. Rolling. Okay.
