Speaker 1:          00:00          How wasn't staring at you. I see where I was looking at you making sure it wasn't a dream. I was like, okay, I'm Keyona Morrison. I am 33 years old and I'm a marketing manager. My name is Cameron Morrison. I'm 33 years old and I'm a building engineer. Were married for five years. We have one and one on the way. I'm nine months now, so I should be having this baby any day.

Speaker 2:          00:42          Wow.

Speaker 1:          00:44          So I had just moved to La. I had a friend in town who was an aspiring actress. She invited me to one of her plays and we met there. He kept asking me questions and looking at me from across the room and I'm like, Weirdo. She'll probably tell you that I'll staring at her. But you know, I was uh, actually trying to assure that there was a connection. I thought there, there might've been a connection to a, one of the conversations she was, she was pretty personable, easy going, I saw you get up after party. Right. And he kept staring at me. I wasn't staring at you. I see where, all right. So one of the first day I was wanting to show around La really, uh, we went to Venice beach, we had to kind of navigate around the crowd and I was really impressed how well she walked with me. And I think that's one of the things that, that, that told me I needed to look for a second date. He probably didn't tell you this part, but when he first picked me up from my apartment, I told him the wrong address so that he wouldn't know where I lived. I know that he took me to Venice beach. I just remember him like putting his arm around me and us walking through the crowd and I just felt comfortable. So we went to Venice beach after I picked her up down the street.

Speaker 1:          02:02          Murphy, I remember that we were walking together like we knew each other. We were comfortable.

Speaker 1:          02:11          I think I came home from work one day, you know, I'm just in the routine. Come up the stairs, drop my stuff off at the door. She was up, had the lights on and uh, no, she wants to pray with me. So we bought our heads and at the end of the prayer she asked God to just prepare us, prepare our steps, prepare me to be the father that she was now pregnant with. It was crazy. I found out I was on a business trip, so I had to hold it. I think I was gone for three days. And you know, I tell my mom, my sister on the phone and then when I got home, I had the pregnancy test. I recorded him and his reaction, I think I just gave it to him. He was shocked and he just kept saying, wow, wow, you came home, came up the stairs and I think I just gave you the, we pray, we prayed. And then at the end of the prayer you ask God to, uh, oh my gosh. Apparently I forget that prepared me to be the father, you know, hey, you're like, wait a second.

Speaker 1:          03:15          It was pretty much everything I thought he would be because I knew those qualities existed in him. He's caring. So with Nala, it's just on another level. He loves the hell out of that girl. And, and she loves him too. She's strong mother. I don't know how she already knows what to do, but it seems like she's been doing this for a while. Yeah. That's impressive. I don't have doubts or reservations about the next one coming in the world. You're just a good dad. Like she's got you wrapped around her finger, like she's going to be the spoiled little girl because of you. That's all right. I'm really just coming to terms with the party being over and really mentoring. Um, a lot of time shooting myself in the foot with my drinking. One time I came home and you know, she, uh, she said something that really triggered me

Speaker 2:          04:17          and

Speaker 1:          04:20          you know, I know I yelled at her. I don't know exactly what I say it, but I know I was yelling at the top of my lungs. She was fearful. She was scared and uh, wasn't pretty definitely dealing with Cameron's sobriety. He's one way when he's sober and then when he drinks, he's a completely different person. He wasn't abusive at all or anything, but it's just he changed. They are things that are forgiven, but they can't really be forgotten without the alcohol, without the distractions. He's everything. I like, I know what his intentions are and they would never to hurt me on purpose. So,

Speaker 2:          05:18          okay.

Speaker 1:          05:19          Dealing with, you know, my drinking, dealing with my smoking. Yeah. It just really making some, some difficult changes with my life. I forgave you, but it's, there are triggers that come up for me and so it brings it all up again. I'm way better at pushing them out. I'm glad that, you know, I have here forgiveness, you know, I struggle with forgiving myself. You know, I'm the one that hurts you the worst. I know who you are outside of that guy who over drink. Well we've all done that and I feel like since I did it in college and I've grown up, like why can't you do the same thing? But it just took you a little longer to realize, oh absolutely. I see is getting old and retiring or some kind of farm somewhere somewhere on the country.

Speaker 1:          06:20          I look at old couples and I think of us like I think that Cameron and I are going to be one of those cute old couples that are still enjoying life together. I'm excited to see him evolve as a father as well. I mean, I don't know how he can get any better, but I just, I'm excited to see it as we raise our kids. I mentioned us on out of on a farm somewhere, you know, I guess. Yeah, but you know, honestly wherever we are, it doesn't matter as long as we were together. Yeah, we're still walking together. Yeah. Father God, we thank you for bringing us to this day. We thank you for opening kiln and I up to I see ourselves and to see the path that you've brought us down so far. All the obstacles and hurdles that you've gotten us over. Thank you for the health of our children. We thank you for this pregnancy and pray for the health of the child that's on its way and we ask that you just continue to be present, get to continue to lead our way. Amen.

Speaker 2:          07:33          Okay.

Speaker 3:          07:34          I say it's the moist were back within a new, uh, Morrison this design. Scott Nolan Moon. Ooh, science here.

Speaker 2:          07:47          Huh?
