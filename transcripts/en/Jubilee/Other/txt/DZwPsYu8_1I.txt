Speaker 1:          00:12          I think the idea of like what money means to me, it has changed. I passed that milestone. I like becoming a military late 2007

Speaker 2:          00:21          Tim. I think money doesn't mean too much to me. I don't think we need as much of it as we think we do. People do find it hard to talk about money because it's so private. It's like talking about underwear.

Speaker 3:          00:41          Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:42          What is going on everyone? It's Turkey with a lot of planning profit. Ah, yesterday covered profits at 63 31 today.

I own a series of real estate properties and I run a series of online businesses. Do you roughly know how much weight you make annually? Yeah. So I've put this year with a different, probably Chris that we have going on. I can probably bring in lights six to 7 million.

Speaker 1:          01:49          And how much do you see you make? Like on average

Speaker 2:          01:53          I can make like easily like a hundred and

Like it's not much, it's just because I'm right now invested with about $30,000 boom, boom, boom. What's going on guys? I made a mistake and I covered profits yesterday on you yas and luck. What I missed out on. We have these here at the Ra there. I have my other GGR over there. I own that house to my favorite part of the day is working with my private group and seen the excitement that they give back is probably one of the most rewarding things. My goal is to create a series of applications that are worth hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars. Right. I think if I had

Speaker 2:          02:54          $10 billion in my pocket right now, I think I would still be the same person. I have a stronger relationship with my faith. Matthew six and 21 says, wherever your treasure is, the desires of your heart,

Speaker 1:          03:06          we'll be also what is going on everyone. I'm going to be packaging some orders for tech with apparel. She's just saying your parents to Europe. Yeah, so they went for I think a total of like 24 days. Did you buy your trance? A water thing and you tell me that they like ass or needs something. Like I'll be like paying my little sister's tuition for our university and then anytime that they like running low or something, then I can assess. But

Speaker 2:          03:34          what's up Instagram? You'll look. It's a good day. We got, we got John here. He's following me around all day pretending that my life is interesting. It might be dirty

Speaker 4:          03:46          and I'm not willing to say so much beside them is that they should pay me break. Let's make perfect. I'm pregnant. This baby it Brett does make perfect. I'll bring, this is baby that I miss daisy.

Speaker 1:          04:44          Reiki. Where are you at with your trading today? Do you know? I'm down. Oh my God. I actually more than I thought $902 you sweat that at all or no, because like I've been down like $2,000 and I recovers and I make like $3,000 on it. So,

Speaker 2:          05:15          so right now as you can see, we don't have any delivery, so we're waiting, playing the waiting game. It's Kinda, it's, it's like when you text your crush and then you're waiting for her to text you back. But she never does.

Speaker 3:          05:29          Honestly, I think I messed up in this position.

Speaker 1:          05:35          I'm someone that like I, I value the dollar so much. Like you saw me go to chipolte that and I won't get a drink. I just became very food or from a very early age and very aware of how to try to pick money and the stress that it brings on and seeing how it acted as a negative catalyst for my parents' relationship. We went to Mcdonald's and I overheard that by parents weren't doing as well financially. And my cousin was like, oh, I want a big Mac and I want large fries. I like looked at him and I was like, no, don't get that. Like, you know, just because of the extra cost. That's when I really started to, you don't try to buy it and sell like snicker bars or power rates just to pay for myself. So my parents didn't have to pay me.

Speaker 3:          06:19          Okay.

Speaker 2:          06:21          That one's going to pay like nine bucks at Asia walk less go. Yeah, yeah, yeah. To dagger February Seafood Delight. How's that grows and a egg flour soup.

Speaker 3:          06:30          Yeah. Awesome.

Speaker 2:          06:35          The order is Hella big. Waiting round two when I was growing up we were, we are good financially up until my age, like seven I guess I would say that was when my mom was like a single mom to me and my two sisters. We didn't know we were poor or like broke or anything because my mom did such a good job of hiding it and just like grinding and hustling. But then like growing up I kind of did understand like our financial hardships, look how much we got paid for that 35 bucks. Cause that's like with the fat tip and whatnot. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          07:26          It's exciting. So what happened? Um,

Speaker 2:          07:30          she says she's missing an item.

Speaker 5:          07:32          Yes. I'm so sorry. Yes. It's another part of your order. We have it back here.

Speaker 3:          07:36          There's three salads. Right. Okay. Thank you.

Speaker 6:          07:42          How many of you guys wants to turn your passion for cars and to profit? We are reopening the 30 day mentorship challenge we sold out last time in three days. All you have to do now is swipe up to learn more.

Speaker 2:          07:52          Uh, I got terrible news. They don't have the tomato and Mozzarella Panini, but

Speaker 3:          07:58          do you have, so I think if this building right here

Speaker 2:          08:04          is 20 to 30 yeah, no problem. Yeah, it's been super slow for like an hour. Um, probably won't get any more orders just because we're downtown and everybody's probably like on their way home already right now. Yeah, we'll just call it a day.

Speaker 3:          08:34          Cool.

Speaker 2:          08:39          Okay.

Speaker 1:          08:46          Do you think the money defines people to you? I think, I think in today's world, um, money definitely does have a, a huge form of credibility.

Speaker 7:          09:02          I believe money can define you if you let it. I don't believe it defines me personally at all. I've had like 27 cents in my bank account and also have had like $3,000 in my checking account. It was just like ready to ball out, you know? And I was the same exact person.

Speaker 1:          09:22          Does money buy happiness? No actual names or when someone who does not buy happiness, I try this quick one. Are you happy? I'd say I know definitely. I'm very happy with, there's no reason not to be happy, right. With where it is that I am. Um, but there's definitely moments that feels like kind of, I kind of know, just like empty.

Speaker 7:          09:53          I think money can't buy happiness, but it can only buy either temporary happiness or things that make you happy. I am. I'm very happy. It's, it's weird. I'm like smiling, answering that and like, I like struggle with depression and stuff, so it's weird, but it's like, like I'm very freaking happen. All right.

Speaker 3:          10:20          You always come through with, what's your name again?

Speaker 7:          10:35          Can you trace any of your income from today?

Speaker 1:          10:39          Yeah, with everything. Um, I'd say probably around about 11,000. 11,000. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          10:48          So what is it that you like to say?

Speaker 1:          10:51          Oh um, you know, continue working hard, continue to fall into James, like your passion, be what your abs and your success. Um, and like always, let's make sure that when the year on every note to go

Speaker 7:          11:03          has Orion. Hey, make some noise for me if he broke all right, y'all didn't hesitate it. You're all getting robbed by the end of this. Yeah. Today the day we made six while we were out in like almost five hours, which is like 12 bucks an hour. I think minimum wage is like 1150. I would like to be making more money and I'm trying to figure out ways to do that. People have lately been telling me. I'm funny. I found that out recently. Um, so that's part of the reason I started doing standup comedy. I can definitely make people laugh. We've got the light hits you. I know, right? He may have a, but write the check, right? The chick, all my friends that graduated high school just graduated college and I'm like, Dang, they broke. They like 120,000 in debt. I'm just like 2000 and debt, you feel me? So we didn't, we can all read books you don't need like.
