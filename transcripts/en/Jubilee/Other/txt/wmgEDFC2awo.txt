Speaker 1:          00:00          Can you sing something for us in touch on that is that is the scariest thing. That's only sing for me on my birthday. Your birthday. Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to

Speaker 2:          00:20          right.

Speaker 3:          00:30          Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:33          We met at a photo shoot where I had to get covered and pepto Bismol it would end up looking like I was wearing a suit of pink paint, but paint is toxic, so we use pepto Bismol instead. So what

Speaker 3:          00:49          we met at a photo shoot, I was in a suit with a gun and then she was covered in Pepto Bismol. I was trying to be a gentleman and just like, you know, keep my eyes up here and not make her feel uncomfortable for the photo shoot and stuff like that. So I was just trying to, to pick her brains and ask her what she was into and Futurama Star Trek. And then she had the doctor who, and I was like, oh man. Okay. She has a nerd. All right, we'll get along.

Speaker 2:          01:16          MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:18          I have a tendency to be too nice and get walked over. And he made sure that I, that that doesn't happen and that I stand up for myself. And he's also just always himself and never feels the need to be anybody else.

Speaker 3:          01:34          I love you because you're one of the sweetest, nicest people I've ever met in my life. I mean, you're nice to people I don't think deserve to be nice to, you know, to, um, when I'm emotional and thrown a fit or just being over the top about something, you're always there to the center mean you're just, you're that little piece of me that I didn't realize I needed until I met you.

Speaker 2:          01:59          Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:59          I don't know if that's everything I was supposed to say or not. It's a lot easier when she's not listening. Who said I love you first

Speaker 1:          02:08          she did by accident. Um, but I was leaving for work. He was, walked me to the door and was saying by why left for work and then he asked for when I was like, okay, well I love you, bye. And then close the door. And we both realized like I was on one side of the door and he was on the other and we both realize that it's the first time you said it. And I was like, what if he didn't mean to say that I don't want to embarrass him. So I like started walking to my car and I'm like, but if he did realize it now I feel so weird is I'm going to run back up. So I ran back up to my apartment all the way up the stairs and then ran up and I was like, did you just say I love you? And he's like, yes, I did by accident. I was like, well I love you too. And then it all worked out.

Speaker 3:          02:46          She was on her way to work and I stay in at her place just kind of like accidentally. I was like, all right, I love you, bye. And then she left and then like as soon as she shut the door, I remember being like, oh Geez, why don't I do that? That was going to be weird. But then yeah, just like a movie, she came running right back in and just kiss me real passionately and Israel sweet and made me feel better about everything.

Speaker 4:          03:10          So

Speaker 3:          03:12          putting on her seatbelt, I uh, I think she gets caught up in her own head though. I think that's her biggest struggle is just, you know, wanting to make sure everybody's happy around her and that everybody is treated fairly. So she gets kind of in her head too much and then I have to let her know that she's doing okay.

Speaker 1:          03:35          Did you talk about my theme? So off.

Speaker 4:          03:42          Okay.

Speaker 1:          03:43          Um, hey bitch. Maddix sometimes he just agrees with me even though he has no idea what we're saying.

Speaker 3:          03:53          I kept trying to make plans and nothing was ever going to seem good enough and I was just going to keep postponing it until something was perfect. So I finally, me being the jerk I am and having a really bad sense of humor, I thought April fools would be the best day to do it. So I was like, you know what? This has to happen. This is a beautiful day for it. If we posted it online, which we didn't. So anyways, we go up to this place called [inaudible]. I had previously gotten our dog Ava, a little dog tag that just said, do you want to watch cartoons with me? You know, cause that's one of our big things is we watch cartoons and we're big geeks and we get to mountain now and I tell her to take a look at the new dog tag. So you're saying, do you want to watch cartoons with me? And I go, well yeah know I'm bent over on one. He was like, yeah, for forever with me. And you know, she said yes. And it was, it was pretty amazing.

Speaker 1:          04:43          He picked me up. He had just gotten like a nicer button down that I didn't recognize. He's like, Oh yeah, just bought this today. I was like, Oh nice. We go home. And he's like, well I kinda had a plan for us today. I hope that's okay. And I was like, okay. He said we were going hiking, but he was wearing his nicer new button down. I was like, are you sure you want to wear that? Hiking, and he's like, oh, it'll be fine. I was like, something's strange. And then it goes to hug me in his heart beating super fast. And I was like, I think he's going to propose today. He asked me to look at our dog's collar and I immediately knew. I'm like, that's a very reared request. I think something very specific is about to happen. He put a a a dog tag on our, our dog's collar, uh, that said one to watch cartoons with me. And so I look at him and I'm like, wait, what? And then he's like, I'm sorry. I wanted something specific that I can say, do you want to watch cartoons with me forever? And then got down on one knee and proposed with his grandmother's ring. And it was very cute.

Speaker 1:          05:44          He is my support in every single way. And uh, he makes me happy. He makes me laugh. He makes me take life a little less seriously. So I think without, I would just be lost completely for the short version and devastated. No, what I would do without you, man. I'm trying not to use bad words, but man, it'd be scary not to have you that wild to think about. I don't like thinking about it.

Speaker 2:          06:22          Okay,

Speaker 1:          06:23          man, you're making me sound like the Ice Queen, but I love you very much.

Speaker 2:          06:28          Okay.
