Speaker 1:          00:00          Did you say that I sniff out loud?

Speaker 2:          00:03          No, but that's a good one.

Speaker 3:          00:11          Sorry.

Speaker 1:          00:18          Really like Quirky, unique, fun and communicative

Speaker 2:          00:23          with a lot of love with a lot of love. I'm going to play Africa by toto. Oh God, I can't hear anything. So this, let's do that. And He'd hate to hear you say right now. I'm tired of listening to Africa by toto. By the very first time I saw a j a I thought he was really nice. He looked friendly. So that's why we went and just chatted.

Speaker 1:          00:57          I didn't make the bed this morning. Huh? Uh, well I met her at an audition. She recognized me and she's like, are you a j Rafael? Um, I used to listen to you in middle school. She said, I was really hoping that she would like tweet about me so I could find her. Sounds kind of creepy.

Speaker 2:          01:17          Um, I said that he was, he looked very friendly and I don't actually, I don't think I said approachable, but I meant to say look, friendly and approachable is so that's why we ended up chatting in the corner of that audition at Disneyland.

Speaker 1:          01:32          Yes. What did she say? Ah, well, I said I was really hoping that you would tweet about me.

Speaker 2:          01:40          Oh my God. Our first date was when we went to see Jo Koy at the Improv show.

Speaker 1:          01:53          I was reading your lips. She literally said this, our first date was that a Jo Koy concert. I think that's when I first made it clear that like, let's make this a date. I said, Joe Quigg concert. Did you read that?

Speaker 2:          02:06          My, yeah, I said that. I said, Jo Koy. He forgets a lot of his own schedule. Like I try to plan things, but then we forget that he has like a shoot or something like that. So it's kind of just comes down to like him being a little bit disorganized, but that would be just one thing that bugs me a little bit.

Speaker 1:          02:29          Sometimes I have to be like to clean. It's like I liked it. Just throw my shoes at the door or not make the bed. She kind of nags at me a little bit for that, but it's fine is not even a big thing really. It doesn't really buy. Okay. The other day bothered me. Did you say that I s I sniff out loud?

Speaker 2:          02:52          No, but that's a good one. Um, I said that you were a bit disorganized. Okay. Yeah, I know. It's just, I'm just so shocked.

Speaker 1:          03:07          I said one thing that bothers me is that you don't let me be dislike.

Speaker 2:          03:15          I would just miss his presence. I love when and where does hanging out. We don't even have to be doing anything. We could be working on two separate things at the same time or just sitting at home watching TV. A lot of the little things in his little, the little quirks and the little weird things we do together.

Speaker 1:          03:33          A lot of like small things like, like we make up a lot of songs like every day. If she was gone right now I would miss her voice a lot because she already doesn't sing that much when she should.

Speaker 2:          03:47          Wait was the question if you went away forever or like a week because I think I answered it as if it was like as if you left for like a couple of days. It was like, I love things that he does a little things

Speaker 1:          03:59          also in the context where I thought you were dead.

Speaker 2:          04:02          Oh, I didn't answer it like that. Oh, I'm gone a lot. So like yeah, you can handle a couple of days. Yeah. That's why. That's why it was no big deal. That's why I was like, I mean, I wouldn't mrs like being there, I think our biggest fight has been about something in his past that I have had issues or I struggled to let go of. It was a big fight that happened a while ago, but it still comes up here and there.

Speaker 1:          04:41          A recent big one kind of stemmed from, uh, my ex girlfriend. Um, yeah, I don't, I don't know how much detail to go into, but it just, you know, like the, my past relationships or dislike a part of me growing to be this man that I am for her now. I think it's hard to explain that perspective sometimes. Like she cuts off for acts as completely and doesn't talk to them. A lot of people like hate the people that they bid with. And it's, it's hard to say that because I don't hate them. I just wish she understood how much I love her and how much I see her as the main person in my life, you know? And I think she's seen a lot of that. Whoever was like a main person in my life and she is trying to fill their shoes, but like, they're, you know, they're part of my past and she is like, she's my present and my future.

Speaker 2:          05:53          I said our biggest fight has been about a face in your path, but I saw it. I couldn't read your lips. He said ex girlfriends. So there it is. Yeah. I mean, that's just the way you are with everything. No, you're not a person to cut people off and you continue to like maintain your relationships at the end of the day. Uh, I love you. I'm sorry if it's a big thing. I Dunno.

Speaker 2:          06:21          I'm going to cry. Well, I, I mean, I just, I know I love you. Like, I know it's not like, uh, it's not something that I'm going to just let define our relationship and define why. Like we would end our relationship because it's so like what we have is way more than that. And even though we have like bumps in the road, I still love you and I'm always going to live you. So yeah, sorry, I'm crying. But yeah, we struggle a lot. We do. Um, but we work on it and we get through every five or every struggle and I know we get stronger from it.

Speaker 1:          07:05          Um, I think maybe you don't hear it enough for me, but like they see a future with us.

Speaker 4:          07:10          I know

Speaker 2:          07:14          patience and learning that were very different in the way we think. Obviously you can't just have one way of thinking. You have to put yourself in the other person's shoes. Balance. I think the importance of quality time, not just with us, but like quality time with myself too, and to be a little more organized. We're not always going to agree on things, but knowing that there's an end goal and that we're still learning how to be adaptable to one another at the end of the day, I think we both see a future with a family and being married and all the cool stuff that comes with being together. Yeah, it feels like our relationship is kind of like an adventure. Like I never really know what the next step is where I've always been the person to always want to know what the next step is. But with him it's been different.

Speaker 1:          08:14          A lot of my friends and people, I haven't talked to her a lot of time, they see that I've like posted about my girlfriend a lot and some they're like, well, I've never seen you post this much about your girlfriend and things like that. I think people see like how much love I have for her and I think it's because she's made me want to like be loud and proud about who I am with her and and who we are together.

Speaker 2:          08:35          I don't know. I love how it feels so natural with you, and I've never had a relationship where it felt this natural before and it happened when we didn't even expect it.

Speaker 1:          08:46          Even through all the ups and downs and stuff, we still, we still love each other through it. You're worth every single thing they go through.

Speaker 5:          08:59          We,

Speaker 4:          09:08          oh shoot.
