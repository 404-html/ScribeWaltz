I have a home, a job. My dream is to be alive. Breathe, survive. You're treated with disrespect when a person 90% of the time. It's given me a lot of information and a lot of things for when this ends because I think differently than I did before about being African American, living in the United States of America. I do not believe in the system. It's not built for me to have esteem about myself and everything that's already set up in place is already built in Meijer for you. The hate crimes throw the lack of proper education, the lack of preparedness based on what this country is supposed to provide in this land of opportunity. I don't see too much opportunity here in skid row.

Speaker 2:          02:23          Skid row is a place where you come. A lot of times when you launch or your dreams, you come here because all the resources are supposedly here so you could get your life back together. But then they are the negative elements here on skid row that can pull you back into that old life. So it's hard for you to dream.

Speaker 4:          03:27          I just overdosed last year. I was in a coma for two weeks. I got out. It took me five months to learn how to walk again. And I've been trying to learn how to walk, but I again, I can't really do it that well.

Speaker 2:          03:37          It's hard. She naps all kinds of substances at a control. A lot of people here aren't in this situation. They want to be here.

Speaker 3:          03:53          Nine g CMIT Oh, few people about the situation down here. My dream is to become a pastor because I feel like God has called me to that. And to actually reach out to people that have gone through what I've gone through right now. My dream is to help others know that not go through the same trials and tribulations. I just want to make our life so that he can grow up. We live in our own house, own yard on that. We're not all beggars down and we're not all people that, that asking for a handout. We're asking for help and assistance with what we want to do. We want to do it for ourselves, but we can't do it without help. People minimize

Speaker 3:          04:50          throughout this whole 50 black community, what I see is homelessness. Why even seen hopelessness? But one thing that is present in every, each and every one of us is dreams and there's a whole lot of dreams here in skid row. It's important to dream dreams because that's what wakes you up in the morning. That's what gets you out of bed. That's what makes you walk. But one thing. Find the other end, aspire to get anywhere. Um, faith. Hope. That's the only thing that keeps me going. Sometimes that's, that's my fuel. And the only thing I'm running on half the time.

Speaker 2:          05:26          And that's why the dreams and the people here, so what people can do

Speaker 3:          05:35          is listen to our voice is two sides to every story. Just hear both sides from being your here we have fantastic.
