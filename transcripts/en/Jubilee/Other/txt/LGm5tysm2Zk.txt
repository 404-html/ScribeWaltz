Speaker 1:          00:00          You have a beautiful smile. Thank you. I have, when you smile, I think it's really authentic.

Speaker 2:          00:04          Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:10          A viral New York Times article featured 36 questions that could supposedly make any two people falling in love. We wanted to see what would happen if we asked these questions to two complete strangers on a blind date.

Speaker 1:          00:22          My name is Charisse Gibbons and I'm currently single. What do you look for? Somebody who's a good listener, someone who's really kind. I also look for someone who I think can have deep conversations and can take things seriously but also can have fun. No, that's kind of opposite, but I liked that in someone. My name is Paula Chung and I'm single, very single. I feel kind of nervous, kind of anxious, kind of excited and I dunno, uh, I don't know what to expect, who do meet, but I think it's going to be a good time to just get to know a new person.

Speaker 1:          01:05          Have you ever been at a place? I've never been on a blind date before. It's my first time. You like most nervous about? Maybe the awkwardness that there'll be in the beginning, but I feel like once we get talking then I think that'll go away. Oh, hi. Nice to meet you. I see you, Paulo and Charisse. Hi Karen. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. How are you from La area originally? I'm from Brazil. Oh, browsing LADOT but as a little boy to the bank. How do you know Portuguese? I let every two months. Really? Yeah, but that's pretty much the extent of what I know. Okay. What about you? Are you from la? I'm from Orange County. All right. Um, moved from the east coast with my family when I was really young. So it's pretty much the majority of what I know. Right.

Speaker 1:          01:57          All right. Do you want some more tea before we begin? I would love some. All right, cool. Yes, please. All right. All right. Do you want to go first? Okay. So do you have a secret hunch about how you will die? I know how I want to die, like in a way where people feel like that was pretty legendary. Know that that's a way to go. I don't know. I don't know. Like saving someone's life really dramatic. Yeah. Korean dramas. Yes. That's such a good answer. How about you? I'm afraid to say it because I don't want to curse myself. You know what I mean? No, don't worry. I've always been afraid that I would die from some sort of disease or really bad car accident. Yeah. Okay. Hopefully it will be quick. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was like, oh shoot, I'm really gonna die in a car accident and then, and then that's it. No time to freak out. Yeah. You can't even freak out. It's so quick. Let's just leave that to God. Can I see more to please? Yes. Stressed.

Speaker 1:          03:00          When did you last sing to yourself or to someone else? Like 15 minutes ago in the car. The car? Yeah. I was listening to some Whitney Houston. What about you? Last time I sang to myself, maybe in the shower sometimes will, I'll be driving and my sister's next to me and then when I started seeing, she's like, can you stop? You're embarrassing me. Oh, does that mean that you can show me a little dance bay right now? I think would just be like a sh a shoulder, you know, like just like a little shimmy. Yeah. Just shoot me. Right? Yeah. You'll be like right next to another car. I'll be like, hey look, I think that will be enough. For what in your life do you feel most grateful? I think most grateful for my family. Very grateful for my parents, my siblings too. I think as a whole week, kind of like compliment each other and complete each other. How many siblings do you have? I'm the oldest. Oh. And then I have a brother, a sister, and then the little brother, three boys and one girl. She suffers a little bit, but that's crazy. Minus three girls and one boy.

Speaker 1:          04:11          Weird who set up this blind date. Pretty good casting in this blind date every year for the past three years, me and my siblings, I've been doing a new year's video. Um, just for fun. That's awesome. And then we post it on Instagram. I see this. Oh my goodness, you guys do this every year. We started like three years ago. Now it's starting to become sort of like a tradition, but yeah, that's, that's my, that's me and my siblings. Yeah. You so much for showing me that name. Three things. You and your partner appeared to having common.

Speaker 1:          04:55          Can do this one together. Korean. I'm half Korean. Um, we've both been to Brazil. You mentioned your dad's a pastor. Okay. My Dad's a pastor to stop it. Oh my. A. Okay. You know Richard, cheers. Cheers. Cheers to the PKS pks out there. Next question. We're good on this. If you can wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability, what would it be? Do you have one? Fearlessness will just so I can see, see how much of it holds them back. Maybe not much. Well, but that'd be interesting. Can I have to rethink mine? Maybe mom was too superficial. It's like, whoa. You're listening to though. Um, I wish I could fly. Shoo the feeling of being able to fly. We'll be awesome. Is there something that you've dreamed of doing for a long time? Why haven't you done it? I think I haven't do I dream about it?

Speaker 1:          05:59          I guess it's a desire. Um, I've wanted to somehow be in the movie. Even if I die on that scene or I just come out, I'm like, hey, and it gets shot. Maybe that's like a small dream, but yeah, it's, it's something that like, oh, I think it would be interesting. You know, similar to yours. I think mine was doing something in film or TV. I've always been afraid to do it because it felt very vulnerable. Yeah. We have like one life. Yeah, that much time. Exactly. It's got to take the chances and do it.

Speaker 1:          06:34          What is your most terrible memory? I got arrested at a checkpoint. I was 19. I remember sitting in handcuffs on the curb, like tearing up and just thinking, how am I going to tell my parents what's going to happen next? Big Life lesson for me. Yeah. And that PK, PK. Okay. I know you all right. I'm terrible memory. The one I can think of right now. I was on set and I was kind of like learning everything I did, like they didn't work out. So like, Hey, can you shoot this? Then I would accidentally step on something. Something will fall. Oh, so like, oh my goodness, like who brought this guy's like, I almost teared up. I was like, oh my goodness, this is so hard. But then it turned into something really positive later because I was like, wow. But I'm so thankful. Despite being super hard, um, I have this opportunity.

Speaker 1:          07:30          Alternate sharing something you consider a positive characteristic of your partner. I'll start. I really like your energy and openness. I think that's a great characteristic to have. Just someone who's a good conversationalist and easy to talk to. I love the fact that you talked about like, I want to be fearless, but I feel like you already are. Like you do a lot of things. You don't want to regret it and you just do it. You're a family guy, you really care about your family and it's very evident that you guys are close. I don't know how many times I talk to people who are at least openly grateful for their parents and for their siblings. So that's cool. You have a beautiful smile. Thank you. When you smile, I think it's really authentic.

Speaker 1:          08:21          What do you go on a second date with your partner? Do we time this the answer or, okay, go first. I'll go first. I would. There's seems to be other factors involved in, in dating. Do you want to get to know someone? Yeah. Do you want to hear more about their story in a safe setting and yeah, I would totally do that. I would totally ask you out on a second date. I feel like, um, we really connected. We had like what, an hour, an hour and a half to talk right now, but I know there's so much more that you sure. Yeah. I don't know what's after this, but I guess like, yeah, we could set up a time or something. I'm still here. Yeah, sounds good to me. Cool. Cool. I want to see another video. Okay. Yeah. Oh, let me, let me, let me find it on the last year.

Speaker 4:          09:14          I feel like I've seen this. I feel like I love your sister.

Speaker 1:          09:21          Yeah, my sister's pretty crazy. I think you'll get along with my sister. She and he or she here? No, she's in Brazil.

Speaker 2:          09:28          She's awesome.
