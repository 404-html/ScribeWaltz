Speaker 1:          00:00          At the time. I was excited to get the call, but everything in my body said say no. Oh, really excited about it for sure. So totally different reactions shall we? One, two, three. Great.

Speaker 2:          00:22          Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:29          Started using the mask as a symbol of just like craziness of being free of uh, becoming something else. I started creating these large black light painting. Somehow the neon cutters allow me to express myself like in a metaphysical way. It got well received. Then it started kind of calling me black light.

Speaker 2:          00:50          Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:51          Huh. How are you feeling? Um, honestly I'm a little nerve wracked. This is just completely outside my comfort zone, which is the reason I said yes. But how would you describe yourself as a painter? I think I would call myself like a contemporary wildlife painter. I kind of take the animal out of its environment and put it on a background that's a little more abstract. When I was younger, that's all I used to do is I used to draw animals and I was completely fascinated by animals and I still have like a deep love of, you know, everything on four feet. If I were to ask you what your expecting today? Um, I know we're going to paint something. I know I'm going to meet another artist and I have no idea who that person is or what they do. I mean, they could be a tattoo artist for all I know.

Speaker 1:          01:45          All right. Hi. How are you pushing her name? Black light. Black light. Okay. Wow. Nice to meet you too. Now I'm very curious about what you do. Oh yeah. This is my cool city. What I do is like I'll do regular colors and then afterwards I'll add a neon colors on top of it. It works with the glasses too. There's glasses. Yeah. Oh my gosh. Okay. No Way. Oh my God. What about you? What kind of artwork do you do? Um, I am a contemporary wildlife painters. Paint animals. Okay. That's cool. It's still sick. That's cool though because if you paint animals that we could do something dope. Yeah. Um, yeah. Okay. Cause I have some ideas. I'm thinking you could paint the animal and I could paint the spirit of the animal. I love that idea, but like super psychedelic with it. Yeah. And you could go like kind of like blend and the animal. The animal. Yeah. Okay. What if we did

Speaker 3:          03:00          something like, like kind of ground the piece by this guy over here?

Speaker 1:          03:05          Yeah. Okay. Like for example, like this will be your bird right here. Right. Okay, cool. Then I'm nervous about creating more sips. Good. Without my normal process, there is a possibility that I will totally eat Kale, but I'm here. Hey, black light. Do you want to look at something like that? So it's eight by 11 I didn't really know what to expect. I'll tell you the truth. I was thinking, okay, is it going to work or their style is going to measure and of course personality wise, you know. However, I was really optimistic. I mean, it was good. All right, you like that?

Speaker 4:          03:52          All right, so, okay,

Speaker 1:          04:09          let's see. I need to like, I need, it's good start.

Speaker 3:          04:14          I had a dream last night about raven. I wanted to paint some recently, you know, he had some birds and some of the work that he showed me and I just thought, well, what if we worked on kind of a raven portrait together? I think part of how we wanted to collaborate is to both retain our styles, but somehow find a way to have it integrate so that it looked like a piece that was collaborated but not super separate.

Speaker 1:          04:48          Once we got these ideas going, it was just, um, play with just like water. It was just streamlined. So I really liked that process of being able to, on the spot, create something and her ideas were really open to mine.

Speaker 3:          05:02          I think he has a really good vision and imagination, you know, even though our work is totally different, we have a similar sensibility. I don't know, it's a little hard to put into words. I think it's just more of a, the vibe.

Speaker 2:          05:21          Okay.

Speaker 1:          05:22          I feel that we, uh, managed to, uh, bridge two styles together and make it work. That's really rewarding in itself.

Speaker 2:          05:32          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          05:43          Keep on coming so long here. Left. You have black lake king when you're right. You have some of Hoover supernatural. Super. Okay. Hi everybody. Hello? Hello. Yeah. Well, I don't know about you, but when I got the call, actually the call, the email and the Instagram message from Mra at the time, I was excited to get the call, but everything in my body said say no cause it, it made me so nervous. You so you were, you were looking forward to it. You weren't nervous the night before. I was more nervous about the project itself, you know, like, yeah, like, uh, the hardworking, but anyhow, I, it was great working with you. I had a lot of fun and I learned a lot. So shall we go? Ready? Ready.

Speaker 3:          06:41          Hey.

Speaker 1:          06:47          So we both kind of tried to focus on our strengths, you know, so I did a more realistic version and he did this amazing psychedelic spiritual version. Yeah. We like the, uh, the raven because he has like, it's like metaphysical, uh, we thought about rebirth a lot and um, it like dying and being reborn into a spirit animal and then, you know, and then we have fun in their worlds. Yeah, yeah,

Speaker 2:          07:11          yeah, yeah.
