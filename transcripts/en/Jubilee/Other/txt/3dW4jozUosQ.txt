Speaker 1:          00:00          The head of this corporation walks in and he looks at me and says, hello doctor shopper, where's your team? And I said, so I work alone in country. I'm the only person who reaches out to kids. And he sat down. He did not say anything for the whole minute. He looked at me and said, she'll buy 500,000 children under five are going blind. You just one goal. You just one person. How many places will you visit? You're never going to get this done. He stood up and walked away. I was actually think he was coming back. Um, he didn't. If he went back and met with that guy again, what would you tell him? Thank you. I caught, I was afraid of snakes. The side of the beacon completely remove their skin really freaked me out. BEMIS origin is the top most that you could achieve. Once you're in medicine, you literally mean a lot of money. I mean, that's the word that most people be use. So when I decided to leave surgery and get into public health, a lot of my peers ridiculed me and me. Temporary insanity. I remember one of my friends, yeah, there for a reason. They're there to tell you that it's not possible, but it's not possible for them.

Speaker 1:          01:40          I lost all of my friends during that time.

Speaker 2:          01:45          One of my things,

Speaker 1:          01:50          why am I afraid of snakes? The snake is able to let go of its skin and start afresh every year. Maybe I should also try and do that. There is a difference between clinical medicine and preventative medicine. In clinical medicine, a patient goes to a doctor when there is something wrong in preventative medicine, I will go to a patient even before they know that something is wrong. So a very early on, I remember visiting a brick field in Kolkata. There were these five kids among 20 I would already blind. They had the white spots on the cornea

Speaker 1:          02:42          and that shocked me to the core. I had never even heard of such a thing before. There was no documentation of so many children being blind in the same place. When a child goes blind because of vitamin E deficiency, the transparent part of the eye, which is called the cornea, literally males, because there's not enough vitamin E to hold the corneal structure together. And I remember this one kid who was three years old and I kept looking at the face trying to catch a glimpse of her eyes, but she kept shying away because I think she was being bullied by the other kids. I just wanted to check with you about the shipping up. Now

Speaker 3:          03:25          I'm going to a birthday shit, but rather the unofficial, uh, uh, employee of whatever she does, I always run around and know she's in Parabola to help her out. She gone, uh, see anyone in bean. That's why she's able to do a job. So you want it to be a doctor since forever.

Speaker 2:          03:48          Okay.

Speaker 3:          03:49          How far do was blame? So we understand what blindness is all about. For us, it's a pretty emotional thing. So for a child who hasn't even seen the world and unable to do it, it, it depends a lot.

Speaker 1:          04:07          So all of these four graphs have been shot by my dad. He used to be a photographer and this is what he did every weekend. Bring other camera and make me photos.

Speaker 1:          04:17          As you can see, I'm very comfortable in front of the camera. I think it was trying to go for the jail. Look, I always have the sense of I couldn't prevent his blindness, but to my current work, I have an opportunity to prevent blindness in someone else. However, it's just the fact that these children are located in such hard to reach areas. It could be an urban slump. They could be migrants who have just come into a city and not daunted by the local health authorities. We knew that there was a problem and we knew what the solution was. Oh, it's a simple intervention. Two capsules a year of high dose vitamin A can prevent blindness in children under five. So we had two dots, but we didn't know how to connect them. Essentially, if I knew that the challenge is in, in dry food, I go to write book, uh, reached 500 kids over day with vitamin E and then I come back. Then I knew of another place in Orissa and the tribal belts over Resa.

Speaker 1:          05:33          We'd each out over them support thousand kids under five and then again come back. Every time I went out to a new area, I will speak to them about the intervention. They would think about it and then they would get back saying it was just me going to a new area and coming back maybe and shorting one doors, but that wouldn't really help. We needed someone to keep doing this program again and again and again do the child was five years of age. I was talking to the auto guy, I was talking to taxi drivers, people on the plane, people in the washroom and most of them would take the card, look at it and say, interesting, we get back to you and it's tough. It's tough because even right now I know that kids in some of the states where you're not getting the Dominik.

Speaker 2:          06:33          Okay,

Speaker 1:          06:34          and you can do only so much.

Speaker 2:          06:41          Okay.

Speaker 1:          06:48          I was visiting a deaf and mute partner. There were these five zero to put into your or speak and they were being taught how to make the tongues and the to make a sound and there was this young girl, the teacher would repeat a different sound every time and she would just keep on saying, the Dj would say far and she would say, God, the Dj would say bar and she would say, just repeat the same sound again and again and again, but she was doing it with so much enthusiasm and so much domination. I couldn't stop myself from crying for 15 minutes. Shaper, how dare you feel disheartened by one failure? How dare you look at this girl, she's five she can't speak. She cannot sure and yet look at the enthusiasm in which he's trying to know. This was not something I was going to be able to do a loan.

Speaker 3:          07:55          I think not many people know about the angry shaper, how angry she can get funds a valuation writing. She, I don't know what the incident was, but she got angry and she just smashed a window pane. Just mash it with the bare hands. [inaudible]. She wanted to learn martial arts. My father never allowed it. He was always updates. You would get some of that.

Speaker 2:          08:19          Okay.

Speaker 1:          08:23          One of my friends had a friend who knew off a mother's group in northern. I had not even heard of Nagaland at that point of time.

Speaker 2:          08:34          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          08:34          [inaudible] is the most eastern steeped in the country of India. It borders with Myanmar.

Speaker 2:          08:40          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          08:42          There's no more durable wrote with some of the villages. They literally had to walk up to a few villages for three days. Even.

Speaker 1:          08:51          You were initially very apprehensive, but we train them within month and we have been preaching about 60 to 70,000 children under five now. For the past seven years, these weren't our doctors or even medical workers. It was a mother's group. All women in the most remote part of the country. That was a surprise. And then from then on, things when you started speeding up, identifying local volunteers who would take the responsibility of saying, yes, we will sustain the program going forward. If you give us the proper tools in terms of training, in terms of medicine, we will take it. And so more people joining this mission is actually what was important. Without whom we would not have been able to reach the number of children we are reaching right now and give reaching 12.5 million children in India right now. I think all of us have our stories. We just need to own up to our story. Why did I have to go through this pain of seeing my most beloved person go through blindness? I think that thing was meant, said, I could understand my colleagues. You do get an understanding of why it's happening, why it's you now I do understand why it's me.

Speaker 2:          10:45          That's my story.

Speaker 4:          10:50          Thank you for watching. Uh, this piece about Dr Shilpa in India and we made this for giving me.

Speaker 5:          10:56          That's right. Not only to highlight Dr Chopra and the amazing work that she's doing, but also to raise awareness for another organization called Doctors Without Borders. They go where no other groups go. They'll respond to natural disasters, a war victims, even disease doctors, nurses, logistical experts. Over 30,000 of them in 60 different countries. I would just stop man. What an incredible opportunity. We have a, especially during this holiday season to raise awareness and money for a really worthy cause and we want to just encourage all of the jubilee leavers out there, uh, to give. This will continue to, to be an opportunity for you guys to give well until the new year watching. Um, so whether it's $1 or $5, definitely one encourage you guys to give.

Speaker 4:          11:37          The other cool thing is when you donate, your donation will be matched. So when you get $5, that's doctors without borders will get $10. Thank you guys for hanging around and thank you for letting us do what we do in highlighting great people in great stories and we hopefully we can do a lot more stick around. We have a lot more videos for you guys that are good stuff. So we'll see you next time.
