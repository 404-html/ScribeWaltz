Speaker 1:          00:00          I was like a pretty chubby kid growing up. We wanted like a girlfriend and you're like, you know, dreamed volleys things and we can do together

Speaker 2:          00:06          a viral New York Times article featured 36 questions that could supposedly make any two people fall in love. We wanted to see what would happen if we ask these questions to two complete strangers on a blind date.

Speaker 1:          00:19          My name is Joseph [inaudible]. I'm a USC student who studies film and television production and he's also 100 mark ones or mark to, nevermind. I've been single for a couple of years now and hoping to find somebody who shares my passions and who I can do the things I love with.

Speaker 3:          00:42          Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:44          Hi, I'm Brian Joseph. I'm briar. I'm from Orange County, California, and I'm currently going to school to become a veterinarian. I've been single for about 10 months now and I'm ready to start dating again. Should we pick a flavor? Sure, yeah. Let's see. What do you prefer? Um, I don't know. I'll help you out a little bit. All right. For Asbury. Sound good? Okay. This is good one for you. Is there something that you've dreamed of doing for a long time and why haven't you done it?

Speaker 1:          01:20          Of the things that I want to do eventually in life, the only one that I would at all have like the slightest bit of possibility to do now would be to just like kind of take off. I'd really like to just do like the Walter Mitty thing and just like,

Speaker 4:          01:33          oh my God, that's my favorite movie of all time. I know I love that movie. Yeah. That's literally what I would like to do too. Yeah. I always told myself as soon as I graduate high school I just want to go traveling up here. But that's one thing I will hold myself to do for sure.

Speaker 1:          01:50          When did you last cry in front of another person or by yourself

Speaker 4:          01:53          or both? I am not too emotional. I don't cry a lot. I think the last time I cried was with my sister when we were watching.

Speaker 3:          02:07          I think it was titanic.

Speaker 4:          02:10          I know that's funny but the only time I will actually cry is if I get like super moved in a movie.

Speaker 1:          02:16          Yeah. It's funny cause I'm like the exact opposite where I, I don't actually think I've ever cried during a movie. I've gotten like teary eyed and clothes and I'll be like, oh wow, I'm not to cry during a movie. And then it just stops. And I'm like, wow, that's sad. There was like a period pretty much for all of freshman year when I was just like very bottled up. And where's it going through a lot of things just with like moving away from home. I would just be like in bed and mermaid sleeping clear across, you know, I just really like silently like tears coming down my face. Um, but yeah, that was it

Speaker 4:          02:46          terrible here. But you seem better now so that's good. The last year was doing a good plane. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:54          Ooh, what is your most treasured memory?

Speaker 3:          03:00          Okay.

Speaker 4:          03:00          I think growing up we would always go out to the desert and just spend like a weekend out there. Like for Christmas during the summer, like anytime. And it was just so fun like being out there because if you go out there it's just like pure silence. Like it's so beautiful.

Speaker 1:          03:17          I think for me, I think this was after like one of my first dates with my girlfriend from high school. Um, and it was like the first serious relationship I had. I the only so far I guess, but same. I was like a pretty chubby kid growing up. And so I always like was like a little Chubby, a weird nerd who will want it, like a girlfriend and you're like, you know, dreamed of all these things and we can do together. But kind of thought that it would just never happen after that. Like first date it was like, oh wait, I actually have that and this is like becoming reality. And like I've gotten here, unless one of those moments when you just kind of feel like you have a good perspective of what life is and you kind of understand how nothing matters except for your personal experience of life because that's the only thing that's real to you. Um, and at that moment that experience was really good. Awesome. Okay. I'm going to laugh. That's okay.

Speaker 4:          04:17          I'd say he's really sweet. He is very intelligent, which I find very attractive. Honestly, my mind went all over the place at first. Then also I was thinking about pretty its eyes work and just kind of focusing on that

Speaker 3:          04:40          green. Right. Or should I put,

Speaker 1:          04:49          I'd say that she's definitely someone who cares a lot about nature and kind of has a spirit of adventure. She looks at her life is like the things that she has in front of her as opposed to thanks Jen, you've got behind you, which is good cause I feel like I probably dwell on the past too much. I feel like I just looked into your

Speaker 4:          05:15          soul. It's Kinda hard to over power the nervousness, but I felt pretty comfortable at the same time. He made really good eye contact and did it make me feel awkward at all? I definitely would. He seems like he'd be really fun. We share a lot of similar interests with nature.

Speaker 1:          05:36          Uh, that was definitely one of the more unique experiences of my life. Um, yeah. And there are bad on a blind date or anything before, so, oh yeah, maybe. Yeah. I mean I think, I think it'd be interesting just to talk more. I don't know. I don't think there's anything romantic there. But interesting just to talk about are similar perspectives on some things you need a little bit. It's like saying that like to her. Yeah. Yeah. I mean hopefully it's not offensive. I mean I don't think, yeah, so they asked if we go on a second date. I'm curious. First of all you said yes. So yeah, I feel like I'm totally honest. Like I'd definitely be down to to go and talk more. Um, I like didn't feel like a, like a romantic spark at all or anything, but I would definitely like, I'd like to continue the conversation that'd be like

Speaker 4:          06:33          definitely hang out and do something fun like go to the beach or something like that. That'd be really cool.

Speaker 1:          06:40          I feel like the difference between friends and romantic interests is really difficult to define and that's something that I've always tried to pinpoint and never been able to.

Speaker 4:          06:49          I would say that it was pretty nerve wracking course. I was really nervous, but it was overall really good experience and I'm really happy it happened.
