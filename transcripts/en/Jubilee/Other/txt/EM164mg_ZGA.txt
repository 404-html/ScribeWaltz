I go by Jay Luna and I'm a producer, singer songwriter.

Speaker 2:          00:49          I just didn't know what to

Speaker 1:          00:50          expect, you know, like just walk in and I heard that it's a music producer. I have never worked with like a beat box. I usually just sounds around me or just like other like producers and stuff. Okay. So you said you're a beatboxer, right? Yeah. That's a crazy sound you can make. Do what the birds flying

Speaker 3:          01:15          beatboxing is making rhythm with your mouth. Right. And then you have like the special effects, you know, like Whoa, like what is that?

Speaker 1:          01:25          Definitely want to utilize all the weird different sounds you can make. And it's like really nice being a guy who like dedicated pretty much the whole life to like rhythm, you know? So let's tous with one of your songs. No, no, no. I'm embarrassed. I showed you might beat box. I guess I will. I guess I will.

Speaker 3:          01:50          I think his voice is Great. It's more like a mellow kind of like wave.

Speaker 1:          01:59          Okay. I think we're all set. Hey man, that was sick. Oh, I see. Yeah, I think it'd be cool for you. Like maybe record you first. I think kind of play off that.

Speaker 3:          02:11          All right. Like just put down some rhythms like go through five or six like slow fast.

Speaker 1:          02:16          Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Do you want to do like a crazy role that's not even humanly possible?

Speaker 3:          02:35          Let's compress the Shah. Let's go. He was definitely interesting to see how he like reversed on the sound stretch. Some sounds. Is that laser sound for sure. Oh yeah.

Speaker 3:          03:46          Never made anything for like dancers. I would like them to enjoy themselves and feel comfortable dancing with them.

Speaker 1:          03:52          When I saw Jane, right? No, I was like, what are these guys took up? I don't know if they like make African beats and stuff. So I guess for like dancing to whatever you guys come up with. Yeah, I think that's, I think that's what it is. That makes most sense to me. So what part are you in the museum be boxing you beatboxing that's so, can we hear something? Oh sure.

How long have you been producing? Uh, I've been through this for like three years. Jay seems like an angel and he just like grease everything. Okay. Yeah, definitely.

Speaker 3:          04:52          Just trying to figure out like what kind of dancing do you guys do or are solid dancing? It's basically the afrobeats describe it really fast with like, your health has a lot of like the group to it. It's more like the beats he get me. Yeah. It's not every day you become a recording artist. I think my favorite part was probably recording the girls. That's when it kind of felt like they all kind of came together where like we all kind of put it into a song and I think that's the best feeling about finishing. The whole credit process felt really organic to the Oakland, to the old one. And that one man, Dad, the guy like, oh cool means waste the backside basically I means is there. So we'll put the homies though the bodies, they're like the waste of there. That's how you kept the crowd basically.

Speaker 3:          06:20          So yeah, they hear that and it's like, it's time to dance. You already know. Well glad I go out of this one stems more from South Africa and it's like, uh, you've been your legging and you bring your army. Everything like bring it around and then the shark or shark who is, it's like you're moving, you're moving and you can do it fast, do it for, but didn't you pull your arms into it and you're just rolling around with it? That's so cool. They were able to fuse our culture and their cultures and their different talents together to bring together a beat that we were able to frank. That's it.

Speaker 1:          07:01          I listened to the song and I'm like, he blocks him to, the ladies are like dancing right there. Boom. Really sick to watch. I'm definitely excited. The communication was there. It wasn't like really rigid and like boring. We were able to like laugh with each other. They joke with each other about different things, so I'm super excited about Lilly. Me.
