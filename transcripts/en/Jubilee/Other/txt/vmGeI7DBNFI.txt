Speaker 1:          00:00          Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:00          Um, uh, I think I would have lost my dad mind if she wasn't there.

Speaker 3:          00:22          My name is Dia Frampton. I'm 31 years old and I am an actress and a singer songwriter.

Speaker 2:          00:29          My name is [inaudible]. I am 31 and I am an actor.

Speaker 3:          00:34          I relationship reading my shit. Yeah, we're in a relationship. Go all right. Here

Speaker 2:          00:42          we were at Busby's, it was super packed and like the Red Sea, I look towards the bar and I see Dhea in amongst the crowd and she was double fisting like alcohol.

Speaker 3:          00:58          I was pretty drunk. I was with my friend Uri and I just leaned over to her and said, that guy's really hot. He had really big hair at that time and I grabbed one of his curls and I kind of pulled on it and then he turned around and I think I just said, hey, I think I went away. It got scared and I ran away. You said that really cool hair. Oh, did I? Yeah, I just said, I said, hey, and then I went away.

Speaker 2:          01:21          Are you saying I have cool hair and you probably heard that a lot. I'm like, yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:24          Wow.

Speaker 3:          01:27          We went on a walk around the Silver Lake Reservoir for our first date and we stopped at Ellie. Melanie got some coffee and we talked a lot about our families and our past and he told me so much about his family that I actually went and wrote a song about it.

Speaker 2:          01:44          She immediately made me feel very comfortable in sharing, uh, things that I struggle with my family to the point where she actually made a song about it. Those are really beautiful song and it made me rethink my whole situation. It was almost like therapy, like someone who really understood,

Speaker 3:          02:01          he paid for my drink, which made me really happy. I don't remember. You did. Okay, cool. I'm not going to lie. I'm a bit old school. I'm from Utah and uh, that's just how I was raised I guess. So if I didn't pay for it, you would have been like, it would've been a little bit of a little for me. It was, it just kind of all these little things piled up. All of a sudden it just felt like love. It just happened.

Speaker 2:          02:33          Yeah, she was performing with her band and by the time I was already getting to know her and how freaked out she gets before she performs and just to know the courage and the bravery to go up there and to really be vulnerable with the audience through your ability to express already. You made me find my more as an artist. It just seemed to be this thing that built up until it was just there. It was the one I like played basketball. I mean like a three pointer. No, you're like, that's so hot. No, no, it wasn't.

Speaker 3:          03:16          He feels uncomfortable with intimacy. I almost feel like he didn't see it a lot growing up. Maybe I've been kind of taking the reins with that and just being very vocal about, hey, touch me or kiss me or kiss me with sometimes and like kiss me with your tongue.

Speaker 1:          03:34          Sure.

Speaker 2:          03:34          Used to be really negative in terms of the competition and negative, like if I didn't get this thing or that thing, it's because of me and my ability.

Speaker 3:          03:47          Just kind of confronting your own intimacy and being open about that and more vulnerable because I don't think you saw that a lot growing up and not seeing your own worth.

Speaker 2:          04:01          That was my main thing is your own worth and how much she means to a lot of people. Me and, yeah. And you know, you don't give yourself enough respect. Yeah. There's always a lot going on, trying to keep up with everything. I always feel like time's running out, I guess as a female musicians or I get scared that I'm getting too old to, you know, barely be making rent and I always am trying to stay positive I guess. And they put you through a lot and I'll put you through a lot to the intimacy. That's something I've, I've learned with, with dia. I didn't really see much of it growing up. Yeah. Like my, my, my mom is deaf, um, very limited language. She has a tough time expressing herself to me and my father very stoic from that generation and they weren't really intimate with each other, so I didn't realize how much that influenced me. But I think the good thing about you though is you're really open to working on things, which is you're the, you're the first person to help recognize that or not be afraid to be like, you're like this.

Speaker 2:          05:30          My biggest vulnerability moment was all my dad. I had a stroke. No, my sister texted me and told me that that isn't a hospital and it's pretty serious and we are, we were actually on the way to palm springs when I got the phone call and I told her that we had to make a u turn and just a lot of stuff in the closet that I want to bring out from our father. And um, uh, I think I would have lost my dad mind if she wasn't there. And I'm just so torn between like yelling at my dad and crying for my dad and she's like, you know, struck in my back and calming me down.

Speaker 3:          06:18          I had a little tour on the east coast and he flew out and there were a lot of people that came to the show is very, very empty. It was a very empty room was in Pennsylvania. And I just, I actually started crying on stage cause I felt almost embarrassed that the room was so empty. He kind of saw me like trying to hold it together. I was trying to manage all my friends who were the musicians and make sure they were happy and pay them and get them settled and then play shows and then also will drive us to the next city. Cause you did all that on your own

Speaker 2:          07:01          in the east coast. I'm like that's so amazing.

Speaker 3:          07:06          No thank you. Yeah I remember him, hey were driving to the birthday party in palm springs and all of a sudden he got a phone call and we just turned around, started going towards the Long Beach. I remember just telling him that if anything happened to his dad that I would be there with him to take care of his mom. I'm lucky I have a very large family. I have five sisters that it would, things go down, we all kind of cup it and come together and he doesn't have that. And that's another thing that I told him is that my family loves him and he, he has five sisters too. Yeah. Now. And they all love him. And just kind of reminding him that he's not dealing with this alone. It's weird because I want to be with him forever. But the m word is just really, it makes me feel like a kid, but it makes me really scared. We went on a break for about six months and during that, that time away I realized that I could not live without him, that whatever our future would be, I would have to be with him. And it wasn't this kind of romantic revelation. It was just fact. I just knew that it was with Khalif.

Speaker 2:          08:32          I always think about this for some, we always think about us on like a very, you know, like a nice little margin chic house with these great couches and a fireplace. And I could see, uh, the pool and the car outside and we're just hanging out like we do now.

Speaker 3:          08:54          I always feel like

Speaker 2:          08:56          all marriages are going to fail and, uh, one of my friends get married. I just secretly like there goes another one. Oh God. Instead of seller celebrating. Mm Love. I just feel like they're in fort. It's too terrifying. I mean I definitely, I think about it sometimes, like I wanted something different from when I knew from Mike. My parents, like I want it to get it right. Just be honest and true as much as I can. And you're on my person. I feel a little smaller when I leave you.

Speaker 1:          09:39          MMM.

Speaker 2:          09:40          Cause I feel very confident, very loud, very supported. You

Speaker 3:          09:46          keep me always looking on the bright side of things and in the present and grateful for what I do have.

Speaker 2:          09:59          Warm. Where you at?

Speaker 1:          10:05          Oh,

Speaker 3:          10:08          I guess I would say home too. I was going to say comfort, but that's Kinda like,

Speaker 2:          10:21          it's job. Even made it through the questionnaire and wheelie walkers. Marco wave.

Speaker 4:          10:33          No, he's getting, it's gonna go and you're left you the sunflower. I think you're to beat to match. Then I'll be left in the dust and the step by you to sunflower, the sunflower, you year your.
