1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.110
What's that Lama and um,

2
00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.220
and the Disney Crisco.

3
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.310
I'm thinking about in person hand crew for some reason.
Yeah.

4
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.510
<v 1>A viral New York Times article featured 36 questions that could supposedly make</v>

5
00:00:14.511 --> 00:00:16.010
any two people fall in love.

6
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.090
We wanted to see what would happen if we ask these questions to two complete

7
00:00:20.091 --> 00:00:21.560
strangers on a blind date.

8
00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.790
<v 0>Hey,
my heart,
why is my heart going like this?
Calm down.
Calm down.</v>

9
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.380
My name is Jonathan Gaurano.
I'm nervous because,
okay.

10
00:00:32.381 --> 00:00:35.800
What happens if I walk and like spill the tea or worse like I burp or like I

11
00:00:35.801 --> 00:00:36.760
fall down.

12
00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.940
<v 2>Well hello.
Hi,
my name is Hannah.</v>

13
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.830
This is my first time on a blind date.

14
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.230
I've only dated three people in my entire life.

15
00:00:48.231 --> 00:00:51.590
So this is something I'm curious to experience.

16
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.690
<v 0>Oh,
nice.
Double.
Hello.
Thank you so much.
Oh,</v>

17
00:00:55.691 --> 00:00:58.260
nice tattoo on your foot.
I am baffled as well.
Thank you.

18
00:00:58.261 --> 00:01:01.920
I said it on your arm there.
Oh thank you.
Do they represent anything?
This is um,

19
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.660
evergreen trees.
Okay.
I'm from Washington.
Oh Nice.
Yeah.
Very cool.

20
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.980
Like my roots and in a sense.
Okay.
Alright.
Alright.

21
00:01:10.981 --> 00:01:13.620
And this one or is this like a spring break situation and you're like,

22
00:01:13.621 --> 00:01:17.770
Hashtag Yolo.
Yeah,
I know.
It says I love you.
Okay.
Yeah.
Um,

23
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.920
so what's your name?
Oh,
my name is Jonathan.
And what is your name then?

24
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.910
I'm Hannah.
Nice to meet you.
Yes.
Right.
You're a pal.
And from there you go,

25
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.260
Jonathan.
Yes.
Okay.

26
00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.760
<v 2>What'd you like to be famous and in what way?</v>

27
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.610
<v 0>Ah,
not really.
Okay.</v>

28
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.190
A more influential maybe like let's say for example,
I write a book.
Okay.

29
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.040
And then someone reads it.
It's like,
oh,
this guy is so cool.

30
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.730
And then you're walking down the street and so,

31
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.370
and that person who read the book goes,
Oh my God,
you're not present.

32
00:01:45.371 --> 00:01:50.030
Has a great mind Jonathan.
And I'm like,
yes I am.
Jonathan.
Pleased to meet you.

33
00:01:50.031 --> 00:01:54.860
I think that way also where like motivate someone to do something.
Yeah.

34
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.410
So that not that type of fame.
What about you?

35
00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.900
<v 2>I think that I wouldn't want to be famous necessarily.</v>

36
00:01:59.901 --> 00:02:02.510
I think I'd want to be influential.
What would it be like?

37
00:02:02.511 --> 00:02:04.580
What does that mean mission that you have,
do you think?

38
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.050
I think too though of our identity,

39
00:02:06.051 --> 00:02:09.770
I think there's a lot of voices in the world is telling us what we should be.

40
00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:10.340
Okay.

41
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.340
Whereas I think that if you are someone who is confidently and beautiful

42
00:02:15.441 --> 00:02:19.310
yourself and authentic and real and raw and vulnerable of people,

43
00:02:19.311 --> 00:02:22.160
I think it really opens doors,
which is I think what we're doing right now.

44
00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.900
No one that's really like opening doors.

45
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.430
<v 0>No,
we're doing this is just,
Oh,</v>

46
00:02:26.431 --> 00:02:29.100
I have three sisters and they would probably like relate to you.
Yeah.

47
00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.240
I love your rings again.
Thank you.
It's like a,
what's that Lama and um,

48
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.850
in the Disney Crisco,
I'm thinking about it in person.

49
00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.500
Crew for some reason.
Yes.

50
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.240
<v 2>It's probably just monitoring.</v>

51
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.750
<v 0>That's what I need.
Oh my God.
And that's exactly what I need right now.
Yeah.
Oh,</v>

52
00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.550
thank God.
What is the greatest accomplishment of your life?

53
00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.530
I was 17 years old.
This is the,
I think the 17 years old.

54
00:02:59.531 --> 00:03:01.390
I'm driving and I was talking to my brother like,
ah,

55
00:03:01.391 --> 00:03:05.800
I got rejected from four colleges.
I just have one left.
We go to the house.

56
00:03:05.801 --> 00:03:09.610
And right now this woman is that we're living with has like DSL,
like Internet.

57
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.840
I'm trying to get into UC Berkeley and we pressed the button and it's the DSL,

58
00:03:16.151 --> 00:03:19.330
like just,
just,
just dish,
dish.

59
00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.700
And slowly but surely I see the words congratulations.
And my brother and I,

60
00:03:24.701 --> 00:03:28.090
we scream or crying.
I'm jumping on the bed.
I'm like,
Oh my God,

61
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.510
I get out the door,
I get on my knees and look in the rain.
I'm like,
yes,

62
00:03:31.511 --> 00:03:35.560
thank you so much.
And I think at that moment,

63
00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.980
my life just drastically changed for the better.

64
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.390
So I think that's my biggest accomplishment that I like and in my head so far.

65
00:03:43.391 --> 00:03:45.190
What about,
what about yours?

66
00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:46.123
<v 2>I did,
um,</v>

67
00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.040
my senior year of high school got to compete nationally in a competition for

68
00:03:49.041 --> 00:03:52.250
musical theater.
Right.
And I think that through that experience in New York,

69
00:03:52.251 --> 00:03:56.630
that grueling,
um,
bootcamp of Broadway,
so to speak,

70
00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.380
I got to really see how dedicated and passionate people are about what,

71
00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.450
what storytelling has topic.
Um,
so you're a story teller.
That's awesome.

72
00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.420
I love it.
I love tea.

73
00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.700
I love that acting like enters you into different areas,

74
00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.450
different cultures,
different,
right.

75
00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.210
And the 1920s,
all of a sudden you're an alien.

76
00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.340
And most importantly I think it gives,
it gives a voice to the marginalized,

77
00:04:22.341 --> 00:04:27.020
I think.
Nice.
Thank you.
Okay.
Sorry.
Good.
Yeah.

78
00:04:27.021 --> 00:04:28.550
So that's why I love what I do and that's,

79
00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.000
I think my biggest accomplishment was trusting that I was meant to do this.

80
00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.930
I like that.
That's good.
I like that.
No,

81
00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:36.410
<v 0>no idea yet.</v>

82
00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.630
People don't care about under resource communities or marginalized community do

83
00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.680
sometimes and just push yourself and you can do it through our,
yeah.

84
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:47.010
How do you feel about your relationship with
your mother?

85
00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:50.480
<v 2>I think my mom is probably one of the strongest women I know.
I'm just,</v>

86
00:04:50.481 --> 00:04:54.590
because I think she embodies,
um,
grace and forgiveness.

87
00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.250
My parents' relationship was a little bit rocky for a while and growing up,

88
00:04:58.251 --> 00:05:02.270
divorced,
um,
kind of,
but then came back together.

89
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.290
So just like this beautiful story of like overcoming challenges and

90
00:05:06.291 --> 00:05:07.700
reconciliation and healing.

91
00:05:07.701 --> 00:05:11.590
So just the fact that she came back and um,

92
00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.500
wow bestowed grace and mercy upon my father was like really beautiful to me to

93
00:05:15.501 --> 00:05:18.800
watch what a brave and she's wonderful.
Yeah.
Azure relationship with your mom.

94
00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.690
Okay.

95
00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.650
<v 0>So I have six younger siblings.
Wow.
You have a big family.
Oh yes.
I love them.</v>

96
00:05:23.651 --> 00:05:26.110
They're my rock.
I mean this is where the tattoo is.
Okay.

97
00:05:26.111 --> 00:05:29.840
I was gonna ask you to describe that.
It's a,
all my siblings,
all six of them,

98
00:05:29.841 --> 00:05:31.030
and then one of them,
you know,

99
00:05:31.031 --> 00:05:34.330
it was queer and so I decided to make the color of a color of love,

100
00:05:34.331 --> 00:05:39.010
which is cool.
Um,
single mom of the seven unlike,

101
00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:43.420
uh,
my father,
she did not leave us,
which is really great.

102
00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:47.350
Like she stuck with us and then she decided to go back to school,

103
00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.970
Breanna Sander,
her pharmacy degree or license.

104
00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.730
And even though she's 60 years old,

105
00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.420
she knows she's grinding away being pharmacist.
But I look at her and I think,

106
00:05:59.421 --> 00:06:01.490
wow,
I respect you so much.
You've,
you've,

107
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.880
you've sacrificed so much of your life for us and for that,

108
00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:10.010
I will always love her for that.

109
00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.210
When did you last cry in front of another person?
Was it by herself?

110
00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:20.660
<v 2>If someone's like with me and we're having a very deep conversation and they</v>

111
00:06:20.661 --> 00:06:21.890
start to cry,
right.

112
00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:25.610
I'll either ha only they're not crying and like want to be the strong person for

113
00:06:25.611 --> 00:06:28.620
them or I'll completely just like cry with them.

114
00:06:28.621 --> 00:06:31.250
Like it's like the silent tears where it's just like you're staring at them and

115
00:06:31.251 --> 00:06:33.530
it's just like a waterfall,
you know?
Wow.

116
00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:34.673
<v 4>I bet.
Yeah.</v>

117
00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:38.560
<v 0>I mean,
I'm a crier I guess.
Yeah.
And you know,</v>

118
00:06:38.561 --> 00:06:43.000
typical you're sitting in the car and you're play like moonlight by Ariana

119
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.640
Grande Day and it's pleasant,
clean.
Yeah.
And as it's going,

120
00:06:45.641 --> 00:06:47.070
you're just thinking about,
you know,

121
00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.620
memories of your life and then you were just driving alone is like,

122
00:06:50.621 --> 00:06:54.940
it's like a little bit dark and a one lane road and of course you begin to like

123
00:06:54.941 --> 00:06:55.774
cry.

124
00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:00.460
But I think the biggest crying situation I guess,

125
00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:02.140
uh,

126
00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:07.140
like last year I got into like a major car accident and my car did like a 360

127
00:07:07.991 --> 00:07:10.720
degree thing and I landed on its tires thankfully.

128
00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:12.670
And so then I just went into the shower,

129
00:07:12.671 --> 00:07:15.640
I turned on the shower and there's blood was like flow hanging all over.

130
00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:20.050
I just broke down for a second.
I think that's the last time was a major crime.

131
00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:24.090
Everything else is just intermittent driving in a car.
Ariana Grande.

132
00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.210
<v 2>Thanks for sharing that though.
That was really cool of you to share.</v>

133
00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:31.690
Thank you so much.
The final task is without speaking,

134
00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:35.740
stare into each other's eyes for four minutes.
That's what we're going to do.

135
00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:39.290
Yeah,
so the eyes are like I for sure,
I think,
or like a window into the soul,

136
00:07:39.291 --> 00:07:41.740
so it's like very vulnerable.
So you ready for this?
Oh my God.

137
00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:46.180
It's actually an acting technique we use in class.
Zen for a second.
Okay.

138
00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:47.213
I think it's,
yeah.

139
00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:50.060
<v 0>All right.
Great.
One,
two,
three,
four.</v>

140
00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:04.710
<v 2>I think that behind his eyes I saw someone who really wants to be seen and</v>

141
00:08:04.931 --> 00:08:05.764
understood.

142
00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:12.090
I kept seeing a little bit of fear behind his eyes and I wanted him to know that

143
00:08:12.091 --> 00:08:13.890
like I was there for him.

144
00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:19.370
<v 0>I would describe Hana as someone who is very like empathetic,</v>

145
00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:22.700
someone who you know,
decides to take a risk,

146
00:08:22.701 --> 00:08:25.010
but on a very like emotional level.

147
00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:35.090
<v 2>We did this crazy like hand thing at the end where it was almost just like I'm</v>

148
00:08:35.091 --> 00:08:39.200
here for you.
Like thank you for this time we got to spend together.

149
00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:45.670
<v 0>I would say that she's in a way courageous because not everyone wants to be</v>

150
00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:46.603
<v 4>vulnerable.</v>

151
00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:52.850
<v 0>Why don't we take a step back and just</v>

152
00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:01.480
<v 2>how do you feel?
I feel like I know things about,
you know I,</v>

153
00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:06.670
I was really surreal.
I don't really know how to put it the words but ineffable,

154
00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:09.080
right?
Yeah.
What you go on a second.

155
00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:16.170
This person would be dope to hang out with her like friends and her as a friend

156
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:21.230
and we could just like hang out like to that would be cool is I kept getting

157
00:09:21.541 --> 00:09:24.810
each other's contact information if we ever any like advice on something.
Right,

158
00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:29.160
exactly.
Is it done?
I think that we're both very different people,

159
00:09:29.161 --> 00:09:32.580
but we connected on a lot of cool points.
It's called First Fridays.

160
00:09:32.581 --> 00:09:33.900
It just heard of it priced frightening.

161
00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:38.820
People go out and they walk along a Venice Abbot Kinney and they eat food

162
00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:43.170
taco trucks.
So that's just like a thought.
You could bring your friends.

163
00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:46.560
I'll bring my friends.
All right,
that's fine.
I like that a lot.

164
00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:53.160
I don't know.
There's this food trucks.
I'm pretty cool.
Uh,
I'm a mountain's girl,

165
00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:54.420
but I might,

166
00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:58.680
I might build and make an excursion to the beach to see him sometime.

167
00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:00.480
I think it'd be fun to go on a second day for sure.

168
00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:05.220
