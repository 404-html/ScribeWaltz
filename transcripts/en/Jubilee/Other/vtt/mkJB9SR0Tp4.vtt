1
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.460
What did I do?

2
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.080
Why does it always come to,

3
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:20.100
that's one look and you're trying not to just to stir in eight weeks.

4
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.310
Yeah.
Sorry for waking you can I grandma always talk to grandma

5
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.300
c sat down

6
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:40.950
when I was a child.

7
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.290
I bought lucky bag every lunar new year from the stores back home.

8
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.980
They're full of surprise gifts to begin the new year with the fresh star and the

9
00:00:52.711 --> 00:00:53.544
good fortune.

10
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.960
I know this is an important year for you,

11
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.000
so I prepare at lucky bag just for you.

12
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.520
Thanks grandma.
To open it yet.

13
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.310
Not until you really need it.
Okay.

14
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.423
Can I grandma?

15
00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.680
<v 1>I've always been a man with a plan.</v>

16
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.850
Always repair number one to leave it to change,

17
00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.570
but it's all in scripted when

18
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.570
it seems familiar.
Yet it all feels so new.

19
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.030
All of a sudden I'm

20
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.820
thinking about all of the things that we've been through.

21
00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.350
It feels like baby,
I'm falling

22
00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.380
to stone.
The

23
00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.560
suddenly,
Oh,
you caught me.

24
00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.600
So we fell in love.
So unexpected,

25
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.410
unexpected,

26
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.140
no money for five years and a day.
Never went.

27
00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.100
Scott Ida,

28
00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:40.350
these words to hold you and kiss you until the end of time and when you're

29
00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:48.290
all the

30
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.380
things a week,

31
00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.970
<v 0>so you're going to ask you this.
Then that kind of,
what's that again?
Are you?</v>

32
00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.870
Yeah,
I'm feeling pretty lucky.
Last command if almost this weekend,

33
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.833
what is this

34
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.963
Jamie?

35
00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.570
<v 1>Talented,
smart and funny.</v>

36
00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.030
You are capable of doing so much more than you can imagine.

37
00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.170
You don't need luck because it's what's inside that matters.

38
00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:45.223
<v 0>Katie,</v>

39
00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:55.303
Katie,

40
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.270
I've had a crush on you this whole year had I just never thought I was good

41
00:04:59.271 --> 00:05:03.930
enough.
Do these past couple of days,
I finally realized that

42
00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.140
it's what's on the inside that matters.

43
00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:34.370
You mind if I join you?

44
00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:46.610
Heartbroken,
Huh?
Yeah.
I think I have just a thing for you,

45
00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.310
the lucky bag and it helped me with on Katie.

46
00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.580
Wait,
don't open it yet.
Not until you really need it.

47
00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.090
Once you go,
give it a shot.

48
00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.560
