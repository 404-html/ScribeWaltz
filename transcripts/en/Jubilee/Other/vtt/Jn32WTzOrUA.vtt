1
00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:01.930
I think I got friends zone right there,

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.960
<v 2>a viral New York Times article featured 36 questions that could supposedly make</v>

3
00:00:11.961 --> 00:00:13.430
any two people falling in love.

4
00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.630
We want it to see what would happen if we ask these questions to two complete

5
00:00:17.631 --> 00:00:19.250
strangers on a blind date.

6
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.520
<v 3>My name's Nicole Ross and I am currently single.</v>

7
00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:28.160
I have no idea what to expect from today,
but I'm excited for

8
00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.260
<v 0>the turnout.
My Name is David Simmons.
I'm single,</v>

9
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.990
but you know,
hopefully this is going to help me find like my perfect match.

10
00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.060
The worst thing that could happen is

11
00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:46.830
am I allowed to say the complete opposite of like what I am into comes out and

12
00:00:48.221 --> 00:00:49.054
like,

13
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:50.280
<v 2>okay.</v>

14
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.160
<v 0>I'm just hoping like we're not going to even have to have like the worst</v>

15
00:00:53.161 --> 00:00:53.994
possible thing.

16
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:01.183
<v 2>Jeez.</v>

17
00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.560
<v 0>What is up?
Hello,
how are you?</v>

18
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.850
<v 3>Great.
Nicole.
Nice to meet David.
Nice to meet you.
Oh yeah,</v>

19
00:01:16.851 --> 00:01:20.100
we're hugging the second floor.
You're my new wife now.

20
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.670
Know why I just decided right now.
Oh Wow.

21
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.560
That's a big leap right to it were to have like a beach date.

22
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.280
This will read to do or do you like get on those little bird things?

23
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.080
We're just going to be flying down like the little pier.
It's going to be fun.

24
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.890
All right.
Right there.
Right.
You're down.

25
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.680
I've been wanting to ride bikes on the pier,

26
00:01:38.681 --> 00:01:40.560
so we're doing it sounds like a plan.

27
00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.060
When did you last sing to yourself and to some,

28
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:45.943
<v 0>one</v>

29
00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.120
last thing to myself was probably like in my Uber here and you're like,

30
00:01:50.121 --> 00:01:52.610
what am I up for?
Trevor and I were like bumped it.

31
00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.730
<v 3>I think I say to myself every day,</v>

32
00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.420
but last time I was saying to someone else last from my best friend's birthday

33
00:01:58.421 --> 00:02:01.880
saying happy birthday.
Bye.
That was like the remix variation.

34
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.070
And you now are you like to,
yeah.

35
00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.720
What is the greatest accomplishment of your life?
Well,

36
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.860
I have a lot you finding myself because growing up I never,

37
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.520
I always felt like I was missing something.

38
00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.940
I never knew what it was and kind of always like relied on other people to fill

39
00:02:20.941 --> 00:02:23.950
my happiness and feel,
um,

40
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.000
just the void that I always wanted filled.

41
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.030
All it took was finding that love and I'm trusting yourself to be able to do

42
00:02:33.421 --> 00:02:34.680
anything you want in life.

43
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.900
<v 0>Wow.
That,
that was honestly insane.</v>

44
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.120
Like I'd never heard anything like more well set did that and can you just made

45
00:02:44.121 --> 00:02:46.160
my accomplishments just like feel like shit.

46
00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.970
So I would say that my greatest accomplishment,

47
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.830
not,

48
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.610
I wouldn't say fighting myself because I'm not entirely sure if I found myself

49
00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.440
yet right.
Entirely.

50
00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.230
But it would just be like learning how to get out of like the social norm.

51
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.650
Everyone just feels like you have to live one certain way and like that's the

52
00:03:05.651 --> 00:03:07.930
only way.
Like you can do anything with your life

53
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.040
<v 3>and just even like moving out here on your own is a huge accomplishment.</v>

54
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:13.240
Being on your own.

55
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.970
<v 0>Thanks a lot.
Yeah,
there's so much that you can save for that,</v>

56
00:03:15.971 --> 00:03:17.770
but I think that was good.
Yeah.

57
00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.910
<v 3>What is your most terrible memory?</v>

58
00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.600
<v 0>Terrible memory.
A high school senior night,
you know,</v>

59
00:03:26.601 --> 00:03:29.600
I was like on the basketball team I was like,
all right,
I'm going to ask this.

60
00:03:29.601 --> 00:03:31.160
Go to prom.
It's going to be awesome.

61
00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.790
I had like people in like the stands holding like prom,
spelled out walk.

62
00:03:34.791 --> 00:03:38.900
My little brother and I over to this girl asked her to like,
uh,

63
00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:42.110
go to prom with me.
She like looked in front of me and she's like,
no.
I was like,

64
00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.160
okay,
I want to know each other.
Yeah.

65
00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.940
Like we talked for a super long time,
but I like she said no by of everyone's.

66
00:03:49.941 --> 00:03:54.740
I was like,
okay,
cool.
She liked,
obviously felt bad,
but it is kind of comical.

67
00:03:54.741 --> 00:03:59.210
So like I look back and laugh.
Wow,
that's horrible.
Never forget your sure.

68
00:03:59.211 --> 00:04:00.560
Bad Karma came her way.

69
00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.480
<v 3>Um,</v>

70
00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.480
my most terrible memory would probably be like right before I moved out here to

71
00:04:07.951 --> 00:04:08.790
California.

72
00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:12.960
I got in this wreck and I had never been in a wreck before and this guy was

73
00:04:12.961 --> 00:04:17.100
drunk driving and it was like late at night and he completely t-boned.

74
00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.570
He had this huge truck and just drove right into me and I just really thought I

75
00:04:21.571 --> 00:04:26.571
was like about to die that night and I was just like freaking out and I will

76
00:04:26.941 --> 00:04:27.631
never forget.

77
00:04:27.631 --> 00:04:32.040
I just like did not know how to react to the rec and I was like crying and try

78
00:04:32.041 --> 00:04:34.530
and get out of the car but I didn't know how to get out of the car cause I was

79
00:04:34.531 --> 00:04:38.870
in so much shock and and so yeah it was just like a terrible feeling.

80
00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.110
I never want to experience again and it just really made me mad that he was like

81
00:04:43.111 --> 00:04:44.040
drunk and

82
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.560
<v 0>that is crazy.
But I at least I lived.</v>

83
00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:52.570
Yeah definitely cause like you lived and you still look fine as fuck.

84
00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:54.293
Like awesome.

85
00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.193
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

86
00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.550
<v 3>What do you value most in a friendship?</v>

87
00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.920
<v 0>Me and just be being trustworthy.
We make friends easily.</v>

88
00:05:04.921 --> 00:05:09.420
I can imagine like you seem really social but like you probably went past people

89
00:05:09.421 --> 00:05:11.510
that I like ended up kind of like screwing you over,

90
00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.190
something like that when he never thought they would.

91
00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.950
I'm 110% honest with all my friends.
I'm going to be like,

92
00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.090
hopefully you do that in return and like not try to like just use me to like

93
00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:23.250
benefit yourself,

94
00:05:23.251 --> 00:05:26.880
but like maybe just like we'd benefit each other like I don't know,

95
00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:28.470
like everything takes a team.

96
00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:32.970
<v 3>Yeah,
I agree.
I think mine would definitely be loyalty but also guidance.</v>

97
00:05:32.971 --> 00:05:37.740
Like I love having friends that like are constantly making sure I'm doing what

98
00:05:37.741 --> 00:05:39.330
my heart is calling me to do.
You know?

99
00:05:39.331 --> 00:05:44.220
Like if you're trying to distract me and I'm like steering me away from

100
00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.030
bettering myself,
then I feel like that's not really a good friendship.

101
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:51.040
<v 0>I'm going to need to keep you around just because like you're in a set me</v>

102
00:05:51.041 --> 00:05:51.874
straight.

103
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:54.910
<v 4>That's my job.</v>

104
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.940
<v 3>Okay.
When did you last cry?
In front of another person and by herself?</v>

105
00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:03.063
<v 0>Oh,</v>

106
00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:07.420
well I just recently broke up with my ex,

107
00:06:07.421 --> 00:06:12.421
so like all my friends had to deal with me like crying and like being soft.

108
00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:18.540
I don't want to give like my time and effort to someone just to get shattered.

109
00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:23.630
<v 3>It's how you learn,
I guess.
Can I go through heartbreak?
If not,
you never know.</v>

110
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:29.090
That's the last time you cried.
Oh yeah.
Ooh,
that's pretty good.

111
00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:31.490
I feel like I cry a lot.
Um,

112
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:36.050
the last time I cried in front of another person was probably like at church,

113
00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.770
you know,
they always say some emotional staffs and then you're like,

114
00:06:39.771 --> 00:06:43.580
you need a Napkin.
I'm like,
so they saw me crying.

115
00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.850
<v 0>Ooh,
I like this one.
So,
uh,</v>

116
00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:52.740
would you go on a second date with your partner?
Aka me?

117
00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:59.450
I'm sorry.
I didn't really like see like the common is like in that,
yeah,

118
00:06:59.451 --> 00:07:00.284
you're like,
ah,

119
00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:02.730
<v 3>yeah,
well I'm the kind of person where like,</v>

120
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.650
I don't really like to consider a date.

121
00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.690
Like I like to really get to know someone.

122
00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:10.200
So if we're hanging out as friends then yes,

123
00:07:10.201 --> 00:07:12.840
because I mean that's like you're still spending time,

124
00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:17.370
but I feel like if it's like a date,
then you have to look at it like,
okay,

125
00:07:17.371 --> 00:07:19.350
I'm going to be in a relationship with this person.

126
00:07:19.351 --> 00:07:23.220
So I'm Kinda like old school with it.
I go with the flow.

127
00:07:23.221 --> 00:07:26.730
If it's meant to happen again,
then will definitely happen again.
If not,

128
00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.100
then we definitely got the experience from it,
you know?

129
00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:34.330
<v 0>Okay,
well that's Loki hurt my feelings,
but</v>

130
00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:38.200
I did not say we're not ever going to see each other again.
No.

131
00:07:38.201 --> 00:07:42.910
Because I already know are going to.
Exactly.
So shouldn't be hurt I suppose.

132
00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:45.220
But uh,
yes,

133
00:07:45.221 --> 00:07:49.870
I would definitely go on another date with you and,
uh,

134
00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:53.320
I guess when we leave here,
that's when it starts.
Yeah.

135
00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:59.730
So we're taking another sip of tea on that one.
All right.
Cheers.

136
00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:01.930
Of course.
New Friendships.

137
00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:08.710
I think I got friends,
right?
Ashley?
I new friendships.

138
00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:12.240
<v 3>I clicked off that you're going to get to date me clearly.</v>

139
00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:15.300
I'm just checking my heart tech.
I'm a pro fisherman,

140
00:08:15.301 --> 00:08:18.710
so I guess I'll find out just like real.
And if you said

141
00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:21.473
it'd be fun,

142
00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:23.940
