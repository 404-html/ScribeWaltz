1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.170
All black people aren't going to be the same.

2
00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.070
<v 1>Cool.
And I agree with you and that's why I'm going to disagree column.</v>

3
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.000
I don't need that kind of foolishness around what's up,

4
00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.680
<v 2>run over here.</v>

5
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.490
<v 1>I thoroughly enjoy fragile.
I love it.
You know,</v>

6
00:00:54.491 --> 00:00:58.660
I understand the stereotypes about it and all that kind of stuff,
but I love it.

7
00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.620
<v 3>I just don't really like fried food.
I'm not really a fan of chicken.</v>

8
00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.540
I've never ate it.
So
you've never had fried chicken?
I have had it.

9
00:01:07.541 --> 00:01:09.760
I just,
I don't enjoy it.
I don't really eat fried foods.

10
00:01:09.761 --> 00:01:11.680
I try to eat pretty healthy.
So

11
00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.570
<v 0>there's nothing wrong.</v>

12
00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.240
<v 2>Three,
two,
one</v>

13
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.450
<v 0>silly.
I'm always on the wrong side of the room.</v>

14
00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.430
<v 3>Would you guys be excited if I had dreads since I'm biracial,</v>

15
00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.680
since I'm half black and half white.
So where is the line?

16
00:01:41.681 --> 00:01:43.440
Like if someone's a quarter black,

17
00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.310
<v 0>I'm not going to sit there and come to your face and be like,</v>

18
00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.810
you're not a hundred percent black,
therefore you can't.
Like that's not my place.

19
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:55.850
However,
um,
if you a white person and you have dreads in her hair,

20
00:01:55.851 --> 00:01:56.980
it's like what?
What does,

21
00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.240
what does that mean to you and you're not even wearing them,
right?

22
00:01:59.241 --> 00:02:03.320
Like you don't even wash them.
I just don't see how race can own a hairstyle.

23
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.490
It to be honest,
like pairs,
hair,
there's all kinds of hairstyles in Africa.

24
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.530
I still don't think that like a single race group can say this one hairstyle.

25
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.030
Nobody else can do it but me.

26
00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.163
<v 2>Oh Jesus.</v>

27
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.083
Wow.

28
00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.410
<v 0>This cookout needs to just die.
Like I know for Cook outs,</v>

29
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.840
no bra just go home.
Like they ain't no cookout.
I'm sorry.

30
00:02:40.841 --> 00:02:45.841
I I strongly agree because I don't like the idea of perpetuating this concept

31
00:02:46.451 --> 00:02:50.440
that all black people have to be the same and think the same and act the same.

32
00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.420
I don't think he's fully understood.

33
00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.310
People like Kanye or creatives and he uses like creative speech and some people

34
00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.780
just take him at face value,
like uh,

35
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.680
like kind of like the literal sense of what he's saying.
And if you did that,

36
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.930
every creative could be taken the wrong way.

37
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.210
<v 3>I disagree with that either.</v>

38
00:03:06.211 --> 00:03:08.890
Like I don't think that he's so creative and that has words are being

39
00:03:08.891 --> 00:03:09.640
misinterpreted.

40
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.570
Like he's making very specific phrases like black people chose to be slaves.

41
00:03:13.571 --> 00:03:16.600
That's completely untrue.
And in my opinion,
that's just unacceptable.

42
00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.970
But I think that's,
that's people misunderstanding what he said.
I don't think,

43
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.080
how do you interpret that?

44
00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.320
<v 0>Well,
he's saying is there,
there's a,
there's a mindset,
um,
where,</v>

45
00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.230
where,
you know,
we were

46
00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.370
<v 3>so okay.
Like he was trying to say it in the term of like,
you know,</v>

47
00:03:35.371 --> 00:03:38.310
it was a choice for you to stay there when you knew that you could have done

48
00:03:38.311 --> 00:03:40.650
whatever else to get out and maybe you would have ended up dead,

49
00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.030
but it would have been better than being asleep.

50
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.680
<v 2>So I don't,
I don't</v>

51
00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.780
<v 1>like this is the gates,
the millions of people who did</v>

52
00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:52.040
<v 0>there.</v>

53
00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.190
Don't you believe that today there are people whose mindset their corporate

54
00:03:55.191 --> 00:03:57.100
slaves or there or there

55
00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.440
<v 1>the language you use kind of guy.
He's an artist.
He's a lyricist.</v>

56
00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.540
So you can't say stuff like that because having learned that history yet,

57
00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:11.410
and some people don't know that it was millions and millions and millions of

58
00:04:11.411 --> 00:04:14.590
blacks who fall,
present,
fall asleep,

59
00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.960
<v 3>you're right in that he needs to be more conscious of his word choice because</v>

60
00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:19.570
there's not everybody who's going to understand that.

61
00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:22.620
<v 1>And that's why I say somebody is smart.
It's Kanye.</v>

62
00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.810
I think he's doing this for shock value and for money.

63
00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.290
And if he's doing that he said and people back and that's why I can't rock with

64
00:04:28.291 --> 00:04:28.890
him on that

65
00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:29.701
<v 0>scares me.</v>

66
00:04:29.701 --> 00:04:34.701
Is the second somebody big in PC or not or they or they're able to articulate

67
00:04:34.771 --> 00:04:35.431
what they're trying to say.

68
00:04:35.431 --> 00:04:38.260
Well or not that they're excluded from cookouts and from,

69
00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.530
from a culture and from,
from your identity.

70
00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.350
And I think that's scary because I'll tell you right now,

71
00:04:43.351 --> 00:04:47.160
the more we treat people who are different and isolate ourselves,

72
00:04:47.161 --> 00:04:50.520
even I think the worst of this for us long term,
and to be honest,

73
00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.760
if we're going to drive more and more people to have closeted feelings and

74
00:04:53.761 --> 00:04:55.730
emotions,
and this goes back to people saying like,

75
00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:59.370
like would you rather have a racist next to you that's hiding it or would you

76
00:04:59.371 --> 00:05:02.910
rather have a racist next to you that's letting you know how they feel and you

77
00:05:02.911 --> 00:05:04.140
know where they're coming from.

78
00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.290
<v 1>Who and I agree with you and that's why I put it.</v>

79
00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.510
That's why I'm going to disagree column.
He could come and visit me.

80
00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.140
He wants me to have some conversations,

81
00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:14.590
but right now I don't need that kind of foolishness around the children.

82
00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:18.110
<v 0>Hawaii</v>

83
00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.360
three,
two,
one

84
00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:38.560
<v 1>I said strongly agree.
It was created to monitor the minority in the group.</v>

85
00:05:38.561 --> 00:05:39.790
Back in the day it was the Irish,

86
00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:44.820
it was scallions and so it's ingrained into the system of policing and that's

87
00:05:44.921 --> 00:05:49.030
the problem.
I think we got to reframe what policing is now and until we do that,

88
00:05:49.031 --> 00:05:52.090
it will always be targeting people of color because that's what it was created

89
00:05:52.091 --> 00:05:52.880
to do.

90
00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.560
<v 0>Um,
I see it as like,
there's a little bit of a socio economic piece to it.</v>

91
00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:01.620
It's like kind of saying the SCC mostly prosecutes why people through like years

92
00:06:01.851 --> 00:06:03.560
of institutional racism,
you know,

93
00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.320
where there's poverty and there's communities that are kind of like,

94
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:10.550
have created this like the perfect storm of,
um,
of issues.

95
00:06:10.551 --> 00:06:12.800
Like whether it's legal issues,
people robbing each other,

96
00:06:12.801 --> 00:06:14.650
selling drugs or whatnot.
You know,

97
00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.780
the idea is if you police that neighborhood more and you're going to have more

98
00:06:17.781 --> 00:06:20.840
of them arrested.
Can I ask you the,
can I ask you like,

99
00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:25.250
do you feel like there are equal amount of arrests happening on Wall Street?

100
00:06:25.251 --> 00:06:26.720
The none are happening in the hood,

101
00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:30.500
like the white collar crimes are,
are,

102
00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.850
I do think that there are less like monitored and less without having all the

103
00:06:34.851 --> 00:06:36.440
data that I need,
but I do feel that,

104
00:06:36.441 --> 00:06:40.120
that they don't suffer as much consequence when they,
when they come here.

105
00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:43.850
<v 1>Very true.
You got to look at in the prison industrial complex here too,</v>

106
00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.760
in the u s that's huge business.
So,

107
00:06:46.761 --> 00:06:51.761
and if you look at a group of citizens that have been perceived as no value

108
00:06:52.011 --> 00:06:55.570
having to society or whatever,
okay,
boom,
we're gonna push them.

109
00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.010
We going a pipeline them into that system.

110
00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:00.210
<v 0>Yeah.
I also think that,
you know,</v>

111
00:07:00.211 --> 00:07:04.800
the qualifications to become a police officer are so low and it's like my life

112
00:07:04.801 --> 00:07:08.070
is literally in your hands,
man.
Like if I get pulled over,

113
00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:11.610
maybe that will be the day that I go home to be with the Lord.

114
00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:15.150
And I think that that's really tough for me because you don't want to be

115
00:07:15.151 --> 00:07:16.890
distrustful of the police,

116
00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:22.170
but they're so incredibly distrustful of us that it's like you could literally

117
00:07:22.171 --> 00:07:23.004
kill me.

118
00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:27.110
<v 3>Um,
my father,
what worked in law enforcement and he's a black man.
Um,</v>

119
00:07:27.111 --> 00:07:31.670
so there are some law enforcement officers that don't feel that way.

120
00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:32.421
However,

121
00:07:32.421 --> 00:07:35.270
I think a lot of it does have to do with fear and the fear of black people.

122
00:07:35.271 --> 00:07:40.040
So I think that if we kind of address that fear level on that we didn't portray

123
00:07:40.041 --> 00:07:41.960
black people,
especially black men,
is,
you know,

124
00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:44.990
big scary guys that that would change a lot of stuff.

125
00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:54.453
<v 0>Two,</v>

126
00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:02.880
you will walk in which one?

127
00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:09.850
<v 3>I agree that I act differently around people that aren't black just because like</v>

128
00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:13.930
corporate America doesn't want to hear me talking.
Uh,

129
00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:17.680
it doesn't wanna hear me speaking in slang and I am not happy about it.

130
00:08:17.681 --> 00:08:19.270
Like I wish that it was different,

131
00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:21.400
but I feel like I need to do to fit into that group.

132
00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:24.560
<v 1>I strongly disagree.
I am me wherever I go.</v>

133
00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:29.620
I'm a proud black man and I'm gonna speak my truth every day in a week.

134
00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:32.240
If you don't like it,
she had an ain't on me.
That's on you.

135
00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:35.420
And I feel like it's a disservice to anyone.

136
00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:39.200
I'm around him from not being authentic self because my white friends might want

137
00:08:39.201 --> 00:08:41.720
to hang out with me because I'm black.
They want some flavor.

138
00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:46.030
So if I go in and being something totally different things,

139
00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:46.581
just different things.

140
00:08:46.581 --> 00:08:49.040
One thing is are you changing yourself or are you changing how you're

141
00:08:49.041 --> 00:08:50.960
communicating who you are and I'm changing.

142
00:08:50.961 --> 00:08:53.210
I'm communicating who I am and I still remained the same.

143
00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:56.860
Like do you have a white voice?
Do I have a white horse?
I know,
I know Cole.

144
00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:58.950
I'm a black man.
Trust me.
Every,

145
00:08:58.951 --> 00:09:02.070
every black person growing up in America can code switch.

146
00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:05.850
Then to move a little bit.
Here's the thing.
Here's the thing.

147
00:09:05.851 --> 00:09:10.320
The question was do I act different when I'm in different surroundings and know?

148
00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:13.770
We'll see how would I ever be accepted if I'm always cold switching,

149
00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:17.040
that means I'm always acquiesce into something else.
You see what I'm saying?

150
00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:19.490
So in order to be accepted,
you got to bring you.

151
00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:21.890
<v 3>Do you guys,
when did you say code switch?</v>

152
00:09:21.891 --> 00:09:25.070
Do you mean you change the actual words you say or do you mean you change the

153
00:09:25.071 --> 00:09:26.030
tone of your voice?

154
00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:29.390
<v 1>Actually how I say it and I changed what I say I will,</v>

155
00:09:29.391 --> 00:09:32.060
I'll walk into a business meeting different than how I walked into the

156
00:09:32.061 --> 00:09:36.110
basketball court.
So that's me changing to fit the citizen scenario.
The benefit,

157
00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:38.210
the end goal.
And I don't view that as a negative.

158
00:09:38.211 --> 00:09:40.310
I view that as me focusing on what the end goal is.

159
00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:45.740
But I feel like society has made American society has made black people operate

160
00:09:45.741 --> 00:09:48.680
in that fashion because nobody asks us white people to code switch.

161
00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:51.800
They can breathe,
they can be white in America,
China,

162
00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:54.440
wherever they accept they were around like visa.

163
00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:57.940
But I'm the only one that has to go around and say,
oh hi,
how you doing it?

164
00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:04.353
<v 2>Three</v>

165
00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:12.013
<v 1>collaborate.
Yeah,</v>

166
00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:20.420
<v 3>glad that we all strongly agree.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I love that.
You know,</v>

167
00:10:20.421 --> 00:10:25.421
we can have these discussions and still go home knowing that we're family and I,

168
00:10:26.001 --> 00:10:27.920
and I love,
I love being black.

169
00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:32.210
I love that blackness is expressed in many different ways.
It's not just one way.

170
00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:37.260
I'm proud to be biracial.
I am proud of my immigrant half.
How does my black Hass,

171
00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:40.430
my ancestors brought their own freedom from slavery.

172
00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:45.440
<v 1>Yeah,
I'll,
I love being black.
I wouldn't have it any other way.
Um,
I mean,</v>

173
00:10:45.441 --> 00:10:50.060
yeah,
it presents its challenges,
but I couldn't fathom being something else.

174
00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:54.140
So I am very proud to be an African American in America.

175
00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:04.410
The comment section is going to be blown up when these habits alone.
