1
00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.180
Oh No.
Nobody Dominion by that.

2
00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:03.970
<v 1>Okay.</v>

3
00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:04.803
<v 0>No tomatoes.</v>

4
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.273
Oh No,

5
00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:24.183
I'm so sorry.

6
00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.130
Thank you very much for following us.

7
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.850
He'll just commit concessions does,

8
00:00:35.851 --> 00:00:38.030
you could send bill and people in America will over.

9
00:00:38.031 --> 00:00:41.590
The word can misstep was him.
It's a fashion.
If you do

10
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:44.973
hit your sister.

11
00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:57.420
<v 2>All right,
cool.
So,
um,
let's start with your name.
So,
so what's your name?</v>

12
00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.130
<v 0>My name's I seen on a good day.</v>

13
00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.460
<v 2>And where are you from?</v>

14
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.780
<v 0>Um,
I'm from Egypt.</v>

15
00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.930
<v 2>And um,
when did you start playing soccer?</v>

16
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.003
<v 1>Okay.</v>

17
00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.200
<v 0>I started playing soccer when I was around eight years old.</v>

18
00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.973
<v 1>Oh.</v>

19
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.700
<v 0>I was a kid with some point of his life.
Well,
my parents were getting a divorce.</v>

20
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.400
I was just looking for something to put all my energy and it was just like a

21
00:01:25.401 --> 00:01:26.800
simple getaway from everything.

22
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.680
My grandfather was like a father to me.

23
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.050
You just go with me like your goalkeeper skit on his way back from a business

24
00:01:37.051 --> 00:01:41.520
trip.
You just go me the shoes,
shirt,
the gloves.

25
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.430
So I was like,
I'll give it a try.

26
00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.890
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

27
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.370
<v 0>right.
Go ahead,
Scott.
The very first day I was drained.</v>

28
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.710
What did keep his coach and I was diving for the ball as if like I was diving

29
00:02:07.711 --> 00:02:12.660
into the water
coach came up the music cue on this site.

30
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.840
From there there'll be the head coach of the national team.
Watch,
need.

31
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.190
The next thing we knew we got a call.
You're all this club.
To me it was like,

32
00:02:20.191 --> 00:02:24.320
oh my God,
is this,
is this happening?
And uh,

33
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.720
my dad was in the happy that it wasn't my career.
He's like,

34
00:02:27.721 --> 00:02:30.000
I know you're going to quit at some point and just work with me.

35
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.300
I kept training day and night,
day and night,
all my own.

36
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.720
I was offered a scholarship to school at Florida.
I took it.

37
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.520
I paid for a semester.

38
00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.060
<v 1>I dislocated my knee.</v>

39
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:51.553
Okay.

40
00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.890
<v 0>It was one of the worst injuries I've ever gotten.</v>

41
00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.560
<v 1>Okay.</v>

42
00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.290
<v 0>I was starting to get a grip of everything and then</v>

43
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:00.320
<v 1>boom.</v>

44
00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.153
<v 0>It was all gone</v>

45
00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:05.633
<v 1>and</v>

46
00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.010
<v 0>just things seemed really tough.
I lost my grandfather.</v>

47
00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.180
The figure that I took as my father,

48
00:03:15.181 --> 00:03:19.680
the figure that I looked up to in my entire life.
It just felt like

49
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.710
everything now is going.

50
00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.330
I went to college back home.
I just started working like that

51
00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.290
and at that point I just didn't think I was,

52
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.260
I was ever going to get back into splits.

53
00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:54.683
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

54
00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.840
<v 0>I just felt like I wasn't going anywhere.
I just give up soccer.</v>

55
00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:06.280
It was,

56
00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.970
it was one of the most difficult decisions I've ever had to make in my life.

57
00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.963
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

58
00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:12.700
<v 0>But it was a must.</v>

59
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.580
My sister kept nagging me every single thing to join her,

60
00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.410
the train that the club in the morning,

61
00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:30.820
it was just functional training back then.

62
00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.520
I started training with a friend of mine and all I was doing was honestly like

63
00:04:36.521 --> 00:04:37.354
researching,

64
00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:42.450
reading articles and I was just implementing the workouts we got from soccer.

65
00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.490
It just like ignited something in me.

66
00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:52.270
I was really passionate that developing athletes,

67
00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.690
like I got the opportunity to broaden the states in Spain,

68
00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:01.270
the good physically radiating ways.
I never,
I never knew it was possible.

69
00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.570
I saw how skilled players are here and I thought to myself,

70
00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:11.470
I actually should help develop and giving them the opportunity that they would

71
00:05:11.471 --> 00:05:12.820
never get anywhere else.

72
00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:20.340
But my friend was like,
uh,

73
00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:24.400
he had a different vision and I had my own vision so I decided to take off and I

74
00:05:24.401 --> 00:05:25.234
started at ignite

75
00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.370
when they started ignite.
I didn't have any money,

76
00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:36.610
but I knew where I was going.

77
00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:45.270
You started off with six people in a borrowed gym space that jumped up to 60

78
00:05:45.271 --> 00:05:46.830
people in a matter of weeks.

79
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.460
Like you could see the change in character and I'll be looked at themselves how

80
00:05:50.461 --> 00:05:54.990
they felt.
Everyone would come up to us and be like,
you've changed my life.

81
00:05:54.991 --> 00:05:59.120
I don't know how to thank you.
I started
getting investors.

82
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.950
We started opening other branches.

83
00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:08.650
I started traveling to take certifications and I just wanted to know as much as

84
00:06:08.651 --> 00:06:10.300
I could about the human body and mind

85
00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:15.553
go

86
00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.920
<v 3>one 81 90 kilos.</v>

87
00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:24.370
<v 0>It was difficult at the beginning to have people accept what we're doing as</v>

88
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:29.360
science.
I didn't care how much money I was making at the beginning.

89
00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:31.910
I have to train off these for free.

90
00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:37.250
I have to work my ass off almost 20 hours a day to get people to understand what

91
00:06:39.621 --> 00:06:40.454
we're doing.

92
00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:44.960
I would sleep two to three hours at night to program for my athletes.

93
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.620
There were times where I would sit in my car and,
and I just cry.

94
00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:55.910
Not seeing a way forward,
but I liked the thing.

95
00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:01.120
Things take time to happen.
It's all about hard work and just giving us time.

96
00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:05.370
I go to a call from an athlete,
um,

97
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:09.270
started training just a little bit drunk and just jumps.
So

98
00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:10.413
<v 1>four,</v>

99
00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:12.720
<v 0>he's his own coaches going to leave it.</v>

100
00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:22.330
Well,
this is what I want.
These are the people I really want to help.

101
00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:26.000
I just don't want to just be another trainer.

102
00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:30.680
I want to be the training I want to be.
The one specializes in,

103
00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:34.730
in training these pros who specializes in changing lives.

104
00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:44.593
<v 1>Oh,</v>

105
00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:53.080
<v 0>there's a train started standing out because started asking where they retrain</v>

106
00:07:53.081 --> 00:07:55.550
it.
Word of mouth started rewarding

107
00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:01.920
and then one thing just slept in another and I went from getting the top players

108
00:08:01.921 --> 00:08:04.620
in the league,
the soccer teams themselves.

109
00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:13.360
It was called Keith the show against it.
Actually.
It was like,

110
00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:14.890
are you fucking insane?

111
00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:20.620
Are you outta your mind quitting your family business?
They start from scratch.

112
00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:23.800
Are you insane?
It's something you already have.

113
00:08:23.801 --> 00:08:25.180
You're all going to start all over again.

114
00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:30.040
He didn't understand that was strengthened,
booked something on my own.

115
00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:34.140
<v 1>We saw,
you just called me off.</v>

116
00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:42.680
<v 0>In our culture in Egypt,</v>

117
00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:47.980
there are certain jobs or certain carriers that are sort of an embarrassment.

118
00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:51.560
Coaching was one of them.

119
00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:56.160
It didn't make a difference at all.

120
00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:01.480
I was helping more people prosper in their work and their careers,

121
00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.580
and that in itself to me was like really fulfilling.

122
00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:14.660
I've lived most of my life with my grandfather.
He was a great person.

123
00:09:14.661 --> 00:09:18.020
He was a great man.
He was always giving back to society.

124
00:09:18.021 --> 00:09:20.000
He was always giving back to everyone around me.

125
00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:25.510
I saw how fulfilling it was to him and it just grew that into me.

126
00:09:25.551 --> 00:09:29.960
I guess
when I first say ignite,

127
00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:34.700
I was training one pro athlete.
Today,
my team and I,

128
00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:36.410
we train over 200

129
00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:43.640
the feeling I get when when one of my athletes just advances in their career,

130
00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.460
it's big.
It's bigger than the game itself.

131
00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:55.600
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>
