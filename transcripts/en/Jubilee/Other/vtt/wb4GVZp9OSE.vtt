00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.800
When I was about six or seven years old,

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.100
I was flipping channels on the television.
It was Monday night raw.

3
00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.790
The very first thing I see Jeff Perry guitar over someone's head.

4
00:00:09.791 --> 00:00:10.624
I don't know who was

5
00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:21.670
six year old.
Holy,
that's what I want to do.

6
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.390
My name is [inaudible] and I'm a rapper.
People come up to me,
you know,

7
00:00:34.391 --> 00:00:38.170
there'll be like,
wow,
why are you not huge?

8
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.610
<v 2>Did this,
here's my matchup tonight.
The 1% trial,
Nelson and Roy,</v>

9
00:00:50.611 --> 00:00:55.611
size X.

10
00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.020
Yeah,

11
00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.260
<v 0>we'll never hurt you that look better.
So when it comes to nutrition,</v>

12
00:00:59.261 --> 00:01:02.350
I spend so much freaking money on food.

13
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.940
I live by myself and it's saint.
It's filled with dishes like on a daily basis,

14
00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:11.613
fam.

15
00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.300
I just need to know for sure what time we're going to be here because I'm taking

16
00:01:15.301 --> 00:01:16.134
two o'clock

17
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.960
<v 2>I have a tag team partner.
His name is Roy size.</v>

18
00:01:19.961 --> 00:01:24.760
It's you and I go by the 1% which is the whole idea behind the name does that we

19
00:01:24.761 --> 00:01:28.690
looked better than 99% of the rest of the world.

20
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:34.733
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

21
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.960
<v 0>Jack,
you want to watch Dora or Daniel?</v>

22
00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.700
<v 3>I'm always told myself I'm going to do music.</v>

23
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.163
<v 0>Okay.</v>

24
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.340
<v 5>Very hard.
When me an independent Isp,</v>

25
00:01:51.341 --> 00:01:55.010
you had this voice and want to shout that your life in this womb and nobody

26
00:01:55.011 --> 00:01:55.844
hears you.

27
00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.850
<v 3>Sometimes I'm eating with my friends and even my family members and I'm just</v>

28
00:02:00.851 --> 00:02:03.160
like,
what do I talk about?

29
00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.700
They all like all so she just doing that and I'm just like,
yeah,
I'm sorry.

30
00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:07.760
You know I'm doing an album,

31
00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.450
<v 4>right?</v>

32
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.820
<v 3>I was going on for her adoption.
My parents didn't name me,</v>

33
00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.430
so I was put into a foster home

34
00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.150
based off of my adoption papers.
My foster mother named me Hassan.

35
00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.160
I got into church a lot and I was praying a lot.
My mom was getting worried,

36
00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.290
you know,
and a lot of it was my identity issues,

37
00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.510
<v 2>professional wrestling.
If you break it down to the ground level,
it's a,</v>

38
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.230
it's heroes versus villains.
For the most part.

39
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.780
The wrestling is all about the moments that you can create.

40
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.360
If he can get the fans to invest in those moments.
Are you a,
you're ever feeling?

41
00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.730
I am a bad guy,
100% in real life.
They're going to sleep.

42
00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:51.250
<v 0>Okay.</v>

43
00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.530
<v 3>I've been doing this since I was like 17</v>

44
00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.023
<v 4>okay.</v>

45
00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.070
<v 3>I saw will Smith on camera and I'm,
oh my gosh,
she's cute.</v>

46
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.090
So then I would just follow his life and then I started like in hip hop because

47
00:03:04.091 --> 00:03:04.924
of that.

48
00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.450
<v 2>All right.
Just to check herself out.</v>

49
00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.350
That's enough of that to find some food,
man.

50
00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.550
There's a reason why I buy a Dave's killer bread and bagels.

51
00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.350
11 grams of protein per Bagel,
49 grams of carbs.
Peanut butter.

52
00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:29.120
That's what I need God to go the natural,
I don't know why.
You know what?

53
00:03:29.121 --> 00:03:30.170
I'm gonna check this out right now.

54
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.840
I bet there's not even a single thing different with this.

55
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.210
Any difference in the price?
Nope.
That's how you know,

56
00:03:35.211 --> 00:03:36.350
there ain't shit different with it.

57
00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:38.050
<v 6>Yeah,</v>

58
00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.140
<v 3>we're in Jersey right now and I have a show in Maryland.</v>

59
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.670
It's for the first lady of Maryland and it's actually like a cultural

60
00:03:45.671 --> 00:03:47.640
celebration for,
um,
for adopting.

61
00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.850
I'm assuming she's going to give me the check today for my,
my honorarium,

62
00:03:51.851 --> 00:03:55.420
but because it's like the governor,
you know,

63
00:03:55.421 --> 00:04:00.050
there's a lot of things that come into play.
I think it's age.

64
00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:01.790
<v 6>So you started out?</v>

65
00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:07.550
<v 3>Yeah,
it's Nep.
I was calculating a recently,</v>

66
00:04:07.551 --> 00:04:10.310
if I do all of the songs that I,
you know,
six songs,

67
00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:15.820
it costs roughly around like almost 7,000 for just reporting and to do the

68
00:04:17.811 --> 00:04:21.290
promotions,
music videos,
off photo shoots.

69
00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.560
This EAP would probably caused them as 15,000 everything costs money and even if

70
00:04:26.601 --> 00:04:30.170
it's sometimes it's just 80 bucks a year,
$200 there,

71
00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.270
you turn around and you spend almost a thousand dollars.

72
00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.010
<v 6>Do you know how much of banana costs?</v>

73
00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.830
Well in Los Angeles,

74
00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.880
white lunch and Washington state one from like 17 cents of time since then,

75
00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.000
but now I don't,

76
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.650
I couldn't tell you like I know for sure how much I Samsung Gout to.
Yes.

77
00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:16.910
If I bought it outright,

78
00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:21.810
that's like 600 $700 and you just asked me how much banana toss that I eat every

79
00:05:21.811 --> 00:05:26.180
day.
I'm,
I don't know,
penny.
That'd be great.

80
00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.610
<v 3>Probably going to get burger king.
We'll see.
It's the cheapest though.</v>

81
00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.040
56 gosh,

82
00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:42.740
next second leftover.
When you go on these,

83
00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:44.610
these road trips and stuff,

84
00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.520
it's kind of hard when I see burger king or I see a fast food place,

85
00:05:47.521 --> 00:05:51.240
like I ultimately just want to get it because I love fries and burgers and
stuff.

86
00:05:51.241 --> 00:05:53.050
So it's very hard for me not to go

87
00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.700
<v 2>my pre workout straight to the dome.
I even shake it with water.
Who needs water?</v>

88
00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:10.920
State it.
Oh we beautiful right now

89
00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:14.790
<v 4>for them keeping the
where they come</v>

90
00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:23.660
from.
God.
Then it's ready to charge it hard.

91
00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.670
I don't care what they think and I can't just work on my thesis

92
00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:32.320
cause I never will set a wielder but like a nap.

93
00:06:32.321 --> 00:06:35.660
Just the best deal done for the teeth to bed.
I will live for the to do,

94
00:06:35.661 --> 00:06:39.160
but I will put a lot of just my skills set.
Me going on out

95
00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:51.840
<v 2>my wrestling boots.
This is our gold pair.</v>

96
00:06:51.841 --> 00:06:55.560
1% this one's falling apart though.
Here's our purple one.

97
00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.900
These cost us $50 a pair.

98
00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:01.110
So $250 right there with the rest of them do.
Yeah.

99
00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:02.653
<v 4>Okay</v>

100
00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:12.690
ma'am.
What?
I'm sexy man.

101
00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:15.690
<v 2>Doug,
Doug,
look at this,</v>

102
00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:25.870
<v 3>my checking account and we'll go really low and I'm like,
okay Tim,</v>

103
00:07:25.871 --> 00:07:28.990
you can't take any money out for the next two weeks.
You know,

104
00:07:28.991 --> 00:07:32.050
I'm not blaming Tim because he has a great job.
He works really hard.

105
00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:35.803
<v 7>We've been doing,</v>

106
00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:42.560
I tried to get some over time and I give it to get some extra money to help with

107
00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:48.720
finding music videos or social media stuff.

108
00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:51.460
<v 3>No days.
Me and some of just sitting at home and it's like,
Yo,</v>

109
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.180
I time I need to get a job and it's not that neat but I can't get a job.

110
00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:58.870
I'm taking care of my two kids and if I take care of,
if I get a job,

111
00:07:58.871 --> 00:08:02.950
I got to put one of them in daycare and that kind of like would totally just x

112
00:08:02.951 --> 00:08:04.480
out of my pay check anyway.

113
00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:11.300
<v 0>What are you going to,
this is for later,
but if you want one you can have one.</v>

114
00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:12.213
I'll get

115
00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:21.210
the pain of buying stuff.
I don't need,
there's $10 in the Livingston.

116
00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:26.460
<v 8>Both the bang.
I just feel like later on I might need that little extra kick.</v>

117
00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:27.950
Have you heard your daily [inaudible]

118
00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:31.890
well if you drink this you would.

119
00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:35.970
Can you guys all know how much money each other making tonight?

120
00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:38.970
Oh I know how much Royce is making cause I set up the book and Royce and I

121
00:08:38.971 --> 00:08:41.010
agreed on a hundred each.

122
00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:45.410
So you're making a hundred I like at one 20 I asked for extra swipe.

123
00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:50.910
Do you guys feel that you're a compensated appropriately for like the work that

124
00:08:50.911 --> 00:08:51.990
you put your bodies through here?

125
00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:53.973
<v 4>I would say</v>

126
00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:55.980
<v 8>absolutely not.
I think guys like</v>

127
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:57.750
<v 6>us,
we put in a lot of work.</v>

128
00:08:57.751 --> 00:09:01.250
We're on the road a lot with just driving early mornings.

129
00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:05.790
Even the most basic simple wrestling move you can lose your life if you compare.

130
00:09:05.791 --> 00:09:09.000
Even like when we get paid compared to like stop and stuff like that where

131
00:09:09.001 --> 00:09:12.300
they're in a controlled environment.
There's multiple takes,
there's padding,

132
00:09:12.301 --> 00:09:15.600
there's harnesses,
whatever.
Like now we're just like out there.

133
00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:19.100
Everyone involved in wrestling.
You should be getting paid more.
Yeah,
absolutely.

134
00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:20.263
Yeah.

135
00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:38.080
Yeah.
It's on like a punch or maybe don't throw punches in your mind.

136
00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:40.040
Is that okay?
Okay.

137
00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:47.540
Yeah,
yeah,

138
00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:51.733
<v 4>yeah.</v>

139
00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:01.583
Okay.

140
00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:10.930
[inaudible]

141
00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:26.963
<v 3>wow.</v>

142
00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:37.103
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

143
00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:49.140
<v 6>I was
just,</v>

144
00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:19.660
<v 3>do I base my success off of,
am I selling out stadiums?</v>

145
00:11:19.661 --> 00:11:21.340
Am I going on tours?

146
00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:25.320
I saw like a lot of adoptive parents,

147
00:11:25.321 --> 00:11:29.520
they were smiling when I was up there and hopefully when I meet with them later,

148
00:11:29.521 --> 00:11:32.130
they're going to say,
wow,
like you're like inspiring.

149
00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:34.620
<v 8>It's a roller coaster.
What we do,</v>

150
00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:39.170
we take people through the emotional journey with the physical impact of

151
00:11:39.171 --> 00:11:40.850
storytelling.
Great shirts to work.

152
00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:46.210
<v 3>I may not have made $1 million today.
Oh,
not a billion,</v>

153
00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:48.810
but I may go home and still struggle with money.

154
00:11:48.811 --> 00:11:52.980
I may still wonder when my next show is going to be,
but when I do get that show,

155
00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:54.130
you get those

156
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:57.720
<v 0>people coming up to you.
You know?
That's why you kind of do it.</v>

157
00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:01.840
A lot of us are sit in the car drive,

158
00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:06.070
however miles will we wake up with pain of course,
but do we love it?

159
00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:07.853
Hell yeah.

160
00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:11.923
<v 3>Thank</v>

161
00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:16.650
you guys.

162
00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:26.250
You guys aren't on Instagram,
or

163
00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:33.680
maybe if your kids want to,
they're into hip hop,
you know,
listen to,

164
00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:39.940
it's a great day today.
I love doing shows like this.

165
00:12:39.941 --> 00:12:41.290
You kind of don't know what to expect.

166
00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:46.330
I got people jumping and Sharon and having a great time and you just would never

167
00:12:46.331 --> 00:12:50.080
expect to see certain people doing that,
especially to hip hop.
So

168
00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:53.580
<v 0>we worked harder than anyone in that room tonight.
Come on,</v>

169
00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:05.260
you know,
back to the grind,

170
00:13:05.261 --> 00:13:08.290
doing what I do,
making music,
performing,
and you know,

171
00:13:08.291 --> 00:13:11.590
it's kind of like you hit repeat and keep doing this and keep hoping for the

172
00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:12.443
best.

173
00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:24.870
Or
was it

174
00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:31.560
<v 8>four 30 this is the most expensive article I've ever been to in my life.</v>

175
00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:35.850
I didn't even get up.
I didn't even get a full check.
Nine gallons,

176
00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:38.610
nine gallon.
I'm triggered.
You're very true.

177
00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:43.910
<v 3>I've been shut.
Hoodwink I've been railroaded.
Buffalo.</v>
