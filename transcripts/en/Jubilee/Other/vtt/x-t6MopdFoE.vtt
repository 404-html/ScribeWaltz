1
00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.270
I asked her if she loves you.

2
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:06.803
<v 1>Was that a yes?</v>

3
00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.690
<v 2>I mean,
should I really answer him?</v>

4
00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:28.041
<v 1>I'm hearing.</v>

5
00:00:28.041 --> 00:00:33.041
So I'm 24 and Stephanie if Berg I am 43 years old and if I could describe our

6
00:00:35.501 --> 00:00:40.390
relationship,
it's fiery
rock,

7
00:00:40.391 --> 00:00:44.350
paper,
scissors.
Oh my God.
Was that,
she's from Europe.

8
00:00:44.351 --> 00:00:48.160
So how about you just you go rock.
Okay.
Just put your hand down.

9
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.240
Just leave it there.
Rock,
paper,
scissors.
Okay.
You go first.

10
00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.930
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

11
00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:56.770
<v 1>Oh,
like any,</v>

12
00:00:56.771 --> 00:01:01.771
a couple of this digital world we met through social media specifically I g

13
00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.620
Instagram.
You actually slid into my dms and uh,

14
00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.730
you messaged me about my voice.

15
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.870
<v 2>Well basically he liked few of my pictures.
I went home,</v>

16
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.830
his profile and I got very interested and I started liking and I started like

17
00:01:17.831 --> 00:01:19.120
watching his videos,

18
00:01:19.121 --> 00:01:23.050
what he's doing and I've been really cards with his bus and the,

19
00:01:23.051 --> 00:01:24.270
I just messaged him and I,

20
00:01:24.271 --> 00:01:29.271
I told him that he had an amazing voice and we started talking like that.

21
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.860
<v 1>I was like,
okay,
supermodel.
She looks fairly interesting.
Um,</v>

22
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.850
I think we could get along.
And you're,
you're also slightly intimidating as well.

23
00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:41.410
You still are actually,

24
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.200
<v 2>I just look at that.</v>

25
00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.610
<v 1>Me and a little bit,
no way.
Oh,
come on.
Oh,</v>

26
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.130
like a supermodel Swiss supermodel.

27
00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.940
Like pictures of you naked.

28
00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.910
I would describe our relationship as like,

29
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.570
like a volcano and just mount Vesuvius.

30
00:02:02.571 --> 00:02:07.070
Just like they just boiling underneath a Saute Pan,
you know,

31
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.640
just we're paying for this medium rare steak.

32
00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.070
<v 2>Okay.
He's that good.
The pizza and I'm like the fire.
Yeah.</v>

33
00:02:15.071 --> 00:02:19.510
I mean it's super passionate.
It's super,
I don't know what,
I can't,

34
00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.680
what I can say.
It's a green tabs.
Gosh.
Name.

35
00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.250
<v 1>So are y'all married?
Are you,</v>

36
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.730
<v 0>you friends,
are you friends with benefits?
Like what's the relationship?</v>

37
00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.370
<v 2>This is a good question.
I actually,</v>

38
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.360
<v 1>so uh,
we actually had an argument and um,</v>

39
00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.940
where I stand is that I don't really know exactly and I kind of prefer it that

40
00:02:40.941 --> 00:02:41.420
way.

41
00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.420
Our relationship is like the perfect representation of like a digital postmodern

42
00:02:46.461 --> 00:02:49.010
world where there are absolutely no labels,

43
00:02:49.011 --> 00:02:54.011
no gender and no age or like anything to define what the hell we're experiencing

44
00:02:54.051 --> 00:02:56.030
in this short amount of three months.

45
00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.040
And if I could find a label to describe what the hell happened,
I would

46
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.310
<v 2>be nearly impossible.
Here's my boyfriend.</v>

47
00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.490
No.
Yeah.
I mean,
yeah,
he knows that anybody,
he doesn't want it.

48
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.740
But the thing is like,
I don't feel any word and I don't fear any problems,

49
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.730
like rewarding a relationship.
He fears this kind of things.

50
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.060
So far me,
this is like a normal thing.

51
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.770
This guy is my boyfriend.
Yes.
I want to see him when I have free time.

52
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.090
I don't want to see another one.

53
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.290
<v 1>Well,
I'd like to go with the label this route.</v>

54
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.390
I like to think that we're just doing what we're doing.

55
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.040
We're having fun doing it.

56
00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.800
I think it's too soon to say whether we are boyfriend and girlfriend or not,

57
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.300
but I do.
I do enjoy the time we spend together and I think it's important to,

58
00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.170
yeah,
it's very important.
I agree.
I know,

59
00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.780
<v 2>I know.
It's fine.
I know everything about that</v>

60
00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.490
<v 0>to patient,
to be patient.
I've learned to be passionate,</v>

61
00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.270
to be passionate and

62
00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:08.270
to listen to him.

63
00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.450
<v 2>He is sometimes he's depressed,
he's going in this dark place and I know that,</v>

64
00:04:14.451 --> 00:04:15.710
you know,
like sometimes you know,

65
00:04:15.711 --> 00:04:19.190
you speak and you have to just let it out and look this,
you,

66
00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.430
you feel also better.
Like it's,

67
00:04:21.431 --> 00:04:26.210
it's important and it's important that he has somebody with who he can talk to.

68
00:04:26.211 --> 00:04:29.660
And I told him that and I,
because I want to know him.

69
00:04:29.661 --> 00:04:34.400
Like it's not that I want just to like hang out.
Yeah.
That's cool.
You know?

70
00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.940
No,
I want to know him.
Like I want to know him really.
You know,

71
00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.740
like also when he's sad or his piss off or whatever,

72
00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.950
some older,
the what is making,
yeah,
yeah,

73
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:54.290
<v 0>yeah,
yeah,
yeah.</v>

74
00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.730
I love him.
Of course.
I think he's amazing.

75
00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:02.210
His just other worldly.

76
00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.430
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

77
00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.100
She loves here.

78
00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:21.313
<v 2>I think so.</v>

79
00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.890
<v 1>It was a yes.
Was that a yes?</v>

80
00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:35.910
You know,
I'd already,
you can feel it anyway.
Yeah,
I can feel it.
Yeah.

81
00:05:35.911 --> 00:05:37.590
So of course I love it.

82
00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:41.003
<v 0>Do you love her?</v>

83
00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:46.330
<v 1>Damn.</v>

84
00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:47.783
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

85
00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:49.983
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

86
00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:57.590
<v 1>I do in one particular way.
I mean,</v>

87
00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:03.150
I'm not even sure what love actually is within myself.

88
00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:06.630
So maybe I got to figure that out before I start sending it out to other people.

89
00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:08.910
I don't know.
I don't want to give you the wrong information.

90
00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:13.080
Who knows if I'm right.
With that being said,

91
00:06:13.081 --> 00:06:16.680
I do care for you a lot and I hope the best for you and I really support you

92
00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:20.370
with everything that you do.
You know,

93
00:06:20.371 --> 00:06:25.371
I get these episodes of like just complete hopelessness within myself.

94
00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:31.140
It's for you to see something in someone as young as me and like to really just

95
00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:36.570
believe in me and the way that you do is something that I don't think I've ever

96
00:06:36.571 --> 00:06:37.404
experienced.

97
00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:43.200
<v 2>I don't want him to be depressed because he has so much in himself.</v>

98
00:06:44.501 --> 00:06:47.950
He's so talented and he has everything he could.

99
00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:53.350
This is frustrating me so much because I want him to be happy and,
and yeah,

100
00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.050
this is what I would,
I would say to him,

101
00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:02.200
there is opportunity.
You are so talented.

102
00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:07.480
You can't make it like really high here.

103
00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:08.530
And if you'll make it here,

104
00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:13.030
you will make it everywhere and you can because you are

105
00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:20.110
like,
you'll have everything to do it.
Like,

106
00:07:20.111 --> 00:07:23.530
I trust in you so much.
And this is not only me

107
00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:32.800
<v 1>for some reason it's,
I'm kind of resistant to believing these things.
I Dunno.</v>

108
00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:34.350
I need to,
I think I need to work on

109
00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:41.820
a form of acceptance,
but you know,
I'm just,
for my whole life,

110
00:07:41.821 --> 00:07:46.821
I'm just so used to negative responses and rejections or it becomes almost weird

111
00:07:49.501 --> 00:07:53.150
to receive anything else.
And you know,

112
00:07:53.151 --> 00:07:56.690
I almost long for rejection because that's all I know.

113
00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:02.380
But to hear you believe in me so much,

114
00:08:02.381 --> 00:08:07.330
I think you're slowly teaching me the language that
I'm starting to understand

115
00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:13.960
and I really thank you for that.
And that's why I really care about you.

116
00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:17.470
I think you're,
I think you're a beautiful person.

117
00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:23.500
I think you're extremely unique and you're also also extremely talented.

118
00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:28.310
But on top of that,
you believe in yourself like no other.

119
00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:31.880
And that's something the rest of the world needs to learn.

120
00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:38.560
And I think that's one of the big purposes that you have here to show people

121
00:08:39.411 --> 00:08:40.244
that,

122
00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:46.493
<v 0>yeah,</v>

123
00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:49.353
<v 2>I'm going to cry.</v>

124
00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:56.050
Oh my God.
But really

125
00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:58.560
<v 0>he got something special too.</v>

126
00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:05.250
And I think,
I think everyone's starting to see as well.
