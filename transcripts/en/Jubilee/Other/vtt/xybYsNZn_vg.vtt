1
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.440
Wait,
I

2
00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.380
got to keep on flexing and

3
00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.610
nobody to thank me.
It's my duty to save the world.
I'll be back in a flash.

4
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.260
<v 1>My biggest strength is I'm a hard worker and I always give 110 I think it really</v>

5
00:00:57.871 --> 00:01:02.370
stems from my passion and it may be a great boss and you're in your mercy.

6
00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.380
I raised weakness.
Well Dad,

7
00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.800
I'll express my opinions are tellers.
I disagree with that.

8
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:14.610
Oh that's a great question.

9
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.750
Well I suppose I called Ross Society Society's first alumni country.

10
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.903
That's a good answer.

11
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.183
<v 3>Beads.</v>

12
00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:42.443
<v 1>Okay.</v>

13
00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.183
<v 2>Okay,</v>

14
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.050
<v 4>well thanks for being with us.</v>

15
00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.230
The law school admission board was quite impressed with their application.

16
00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.460
This final interview is our last chance to get to know you a little bit better.

17
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.210
So John,
why don't you start by telling us a little bit about yourself.
Sure.

18
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.410
Well I was born and raised right here in the city and I'm the younger of two

19
00:02:10.411 --> 00:02:15.400
brother and ever since I can remember I've wanted it to be a lawyer and I think

20
00:02:15.401 --> 00:02:19.650
it's really,
before we continue,
let me explain how I got here.
That's me.
John Lee.

21
00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.990
<v 1>Yup.
Of the thousands of names and my parents could have given me.</v>

22
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.380
They chose John.
According to the 2010 census,

23
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.110
5% of the US population is Asian American.

24
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.090
It's 15 million people also,
let's assume a 50 50 gender split,

25
00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:35.870
and they say that Lee is the most common,

26
00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.140
is at 30% and it feels like one out of every 10 Asian guys.

27
00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.720
I is also chunk.
So according to my calculations,

28
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.650
there are another 224,999 other John Lee's rubbing this sir,

29
00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.010
I guess you can say that from birth.

30
00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.480
I was destined to live a pretty typical Asian late.
For my fifth birthday,

31
00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.140
I asked for a baseball Mitt.
Instead,
I received the stethoscope.

32
00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.133
I turned nine.

33
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.330
My parents decided they were putting too much pressure on me to become a doctor,

34
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.230
so they let me choose.
They said I can be a lawyer too if I wanted.

35
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.280
When I was 14 my parents gift to me was an sat book.

36
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.710
It was an interesting childhood.
Cities.
By the time I was ready for college,

37
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.240
the birthday present,
stuck coming,

38
00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:23.710
<v 3>flies.</v>

39
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:29.350
<v 5>Oh,
thanks mom.
It's good for you.</v>

40
00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:31.280
<v 0>Come down for dinner.</v>

41
00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:38.443
No.

42
00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.200
<v 5>Well no,
Tanisha boom,
go.
Uh,</v>

43
00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.050
I'm not sure.
Oh,
I'll check later.

44
00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:56.533
<v 0>Okay.</v>

45
00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:01.410
<v 5>So,
uh,</v>

46
00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.490
you excited to graduate tomorrow and not to college sooner I guess?
Um,

47
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.730
or there'd be more excited.
I was studying film at USC.
USC Bad.

48
00:04:11.731 --> 00:04:15.160
A good film school.
You studied,
prayed hard.
Georgetown.

49
00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.390
Much better choice mom.
You know that law is such an unoriginal major.

50
00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.000
That's what all the kids say when they can't think of anything else to study.

51
00:04:22.001 --> 00:04:25.840
So that are pre law or premed.
Vison you need,
think about future.

52
00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.400
You need respectable career.

53
00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.860
How are you gonna you want to study bill making you study as hobby?
Oh,

54
00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.460
am I told you it's more than just a hobby for me,
but she'd come in.

55
00:04:36.461 --> 00:04:37.294
None of

56
00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.990
that being said that does the movies.
No joking.

57
00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:48.070
This very serious take about computer.

58
00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.210
<v 3>I ain't going to make money from your bank,
but that's how we get old.</v>

59
00:04:51.211 --> 00:04:52.440
You take care of us.

60
00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:58.590
No,
he's so happy.

61
00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:03.130
Happy Studying Pre Med at Columbia Ivy League.

62
00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:04.890
You'd been what I've done and you'll be happy.

63
00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.950
<v 5>I won't say that.
Good.
It had been a big</v>

64
00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.380
<v 4>John Character is important in our profession.</v>

65
00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:26.780
Can you describe someone who has influenced you greatly in your life?
Well,

66
00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.790
that's easy.
That'd be my older brother,
Daniel.
You see,

67
00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:34.160
ever since we're young,
he's been there for me and

68
00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.070
<v 1>I love my older brother Danny,
and we couldn't be more different.</v>

69
00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:42.770
Here's a model site.
I love pricing.
The Piano was dedicated to her studies.

70
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:44.630
I was born to be a dusting.

71
00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:50.960
Let's just say we're pretty different regardless of our differences.

72
00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:54.320
We've always been best friends and he's the only one who's ever supported my

73
00:05:54.321 --> 00:05:55.154
dreams.

74
00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:58.080
<v 5>You</v>

75
00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.710
<v 1>listen ball tonight.
You sure you want to get schooled again?</v>

76
00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:03.030
<v 4>Okay.
Oh yeah.
I'll be down in a sec.
Okay.</v>

77
00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:21.420
<v 0>Hi.
Let's start to get a little bro.
What's up?
What's up?
What's up?</v>

78
00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:25.870
See in a diaper.
She's gotten a lot better,
huh?

79
00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.520
What's that mean?

80
00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:40.183
Oh,

81
00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:47.860
that's bad,
man.
Hey,

82
00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:51.110
well,
mom said earlier,
don't worry about it.
Georgetown.

83
00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.450
Georgetown's a great school.

84
00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:55.870
<v 4>They got a good billing program,
the girls,
and even better</v>

85
00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:00.890
if they know what you're doing this summer.
Yeah,
I was,
uh,

86
00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:03.370
thinking about during that service trip to Africa that you mentioned,

87
00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:07.300
did you bring a camera with you?
Yeah,
that's a good idea.

88
00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:15.583
<v 0>Thanks.</v>

89
00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:26.110
<v 4>Do you ever feel like your life's been mapped out for you already?</v>

90
00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:31.120
Like we're just coloring in the lines.
Yeah.

91
00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:36.220
Mine's kind of like that.
I just wanted to do something more.
There's something,

92
00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.080
there's something great,
you know,

93
00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:41.470
does it make sure you're ready to take the opportunities as they come?

94
00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:46.030
Just like basketball.
Take the open shot.
I never miss.

95
00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:49.840
Hey,
I got you something.

96
00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:54.130
I figure it'll come in handy when you get inspired by all those great ideas of

97
00:07:54.131 --> 00:07:59.110
yours.
Thanks Dan.
You don't use it until you get to school.

98
00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:01.720
You can write down all the things you want to tell me.

99
00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:04.870
I'm sure you'll have a lot of great new,

100
00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:08.410
<v 0>an interesting experiences.
Yeah.</v>

101
00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:12.710
<v 4>Oh my game.
Best out of three.
You're on.</v>

102
00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.393
<v 0>Okay.</v>

103
00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:20.150
<v 1>Daniel is right.
I spent four amazing weeks that summer in Kenya,</v>

104
00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:23.530
which sparked a passion for documentary filmmaking and I never expected,

105
00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:25.770
and then it was right about Georgetown too.

106
00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:31.040
They had a great film program and some pretty cute girls.
In fact,

107
00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:32.930
I discovered this in the first day of school,

108
00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.920
like most college students class that was often used to catch up on sleep.

109
00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.760
Unfortunately,
the class after psych 101 was

110
00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:43.440
<v 6>good morning everyone</v>

111
00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:50.450
and welcome to your first class in the introduction of the female anatomy.

112
00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:00.390
<v 4>My name is professor mud</v>

113
00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:05.590
and today we will be discussing

114
00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:11.400
the Fallopian too.

115
00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:15.183
<v 3>Hmm?</v>

116
00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:19.430
<v 4>Does anyone know what this is?</v>

117
00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:21.853
<v 5>Anyone</v>

118
00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:27.170
or the infamous over

119
00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:35.910
once you get me started on the full cycle

120
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:45.100
to a land that you do not want to go tell us.

121
00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:45.950
Her name is

122
00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:50.750
<v 8>Sarah.
Yeah,
she's really cool.
You're back couple of days so far I think.</v>

123
00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:56.540
I think you'd like her a lot.
I think I'm going to ask her out tonight.

124
00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:00.760
<v 4>Oh,
here she comes.
I call you later,</v>

125
00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:02.403
<v 9>right?</v>

126
00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:17.243
<v 10>Hi Baby.</v>

127
00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:27.560
This smiling.
Laughing is coming.

128
00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:34.640
<v 9>Sarah was unlike any girl I've ever met,
was smart,
passionate and beautiful.</v>

129
00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:37.760
She continuously challenged me to become a better person.

130
00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:40.190
It never failed to put a smile on my face.

131
00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:43.970
<v 3>Ah,</v>

132
00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:11.120
<v 9>I never intended today the first girl I met at college.</v>

133
00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:15.090
<v 4>But sometimes love doesn't work out the way we expect.</v>

134
00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:17.280
Just a couple of final questions.

135
00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:20.730
It's hard decisions that make us who we are.

136
00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:24.720
Can you describe a time in your life that you had to make a really difficult

137
00:11:24.721 --> 00:11:25.554
decision?

138
00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:33.790
Robert Frost once said two roads diverged in a wood and I took the one less

139
00:11:33.791 --> 00:11:36.520
traveled by and that has made all the difference.

140
00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:39.670
Now as I prepared to graduate college,

141
00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:42.310
while I'd like to heed Mr. Frost advice,

142
00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:45.940
I seriously doubt that he had Asian parents blocking the path less traveled.

143
00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:47.713
Also,

144
00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:51.200
it doesn't help that Sarah was now literally dragging me down the well beaten

145
00:11:51.201 --> 00:11:54.690
path to attend law school and ultimately to live in middleclass.

146
00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:59.180
Surburbia hey baby.
Hey,
I got you.

147
00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:04.060
It was some thing.
Don't get me wrong.
I love Sarah,
but this is perfect.

148
00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:08.320
How do I look?
It looks well.
I'll definitely wear.
Thank you so much.

149
00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:11.130
[inaudible] Jerry,
what do you got to?
Um,

150
00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.260
I was actually just journaling a little bit and uh,

151
00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:17.020
I actually finished that application for the film program I talked to you about

152
00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:17.720
earlier.

153
00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:19.640
<v 11>I thought you weren't applying to that program.</v>

154
00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.730
<v 4>You know,
I wasn't going to,
but the more I thought about it,</v>

155
00:12:22.731 --> 00:12:25.430
the more I felt like it was just,
you know,
somebody should do,

156
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.510
<v 11>haven't we talked about this already?
What about going to law school?
You know,</v>

157
00:12:29.511 --> 00:12:34.450
you'd be such a good lawyer.
Look,
I know this means a lot to you,

158
00:12:34.451 --> 00:12:36.940
but what about our plans to live together next year?

159
00:12:36.941 --> 00:12:38.830
I feel like you're just thinking about yourself.

160
00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:44.290
<v 4>I'm sorry.
Can we talk about slider</v>

161
00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:47.053
<v 0>got go</v>

162
00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:13.350
<v 4>that call from my mom mark the worst day of my life.</v>

163
00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:17.160
Daniel was only 23 when he passed away.

164
00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:20.980
My parents convinced everyone that he had died in his sleep,

165
00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:24.820
but the truth was Daniel suffered from depression

166
00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:27.210
<v 10>and ended up taking his own life.</v>

167
00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:37.680
<v 2>To this day,
I still don't fully understand why he did it.</v>

168
00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:41.910
We'd been best friends for my entire life,
but I never saw this coming.

169
00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:48.050
I wish I could have known.
I wish I could have had one more minute with them,

170
00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:50.510
just one to convince them not to do it,

171
00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:55.640
but now that he's gone,
I miss him so much.

172
00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:13.230
<v 9>The rest of my senior year was a bit of a days,</v>

173
00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:18.360
but after Daniel's death I felt like my entire universe was thrown off balance.

174
00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:24.790
I still ended up applying to that film program,
but didn't think too much of it.

175
00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:28.990
Sarah and I never discussed the program or a fight again.

176
00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:32.950
I tried to spend more time with her and she was incredibly supportive and

177
00:14:32.951 --> 00:14:33.784
understanding,

178
00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:38.600
but a couple of weeks after Daniel's death and the day of my final loss of

179
00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:41.200
interview,
I receive some unexpected news,

180
00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:52.340
<v 4>I guess what I got into that film?
Yeah.</v>

181
00:14:55.090 --> 00:14:55.923
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

182
00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:59.360
<v 4>Okay.
I'll call you.
I'll call you after my interview.</v>

183
00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:01.663
Okay,
bye.

184
00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:21.610
<v 13>Hey John,
I'm not sure when you'll find this note.</v>

185
00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:24.430
I figure you'll find it when the time is right.

186
00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:29.410
Just wanted to say that I know mom and dad can be really tough on you.

187
00:15:29.411 --> 00:15:34.090
Sometimes it's because they worry about you and think they're doing what's best

188
00:15:34.091 --> 00:15:36.460
for you.
You know,

189
00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:41.560
I admire you so much and it's encouraging to see your passion for film,

190
00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:43.540
that kind of passion.

191
00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:47.530
It's something I wish I had more of and is what makes life worth living.

192
00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:52.540
Don't worry.
One day mom and dad will come around to,

193
00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:58.300
<v 4>I love you bro.
Love Daniel.</v>

194
00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:03.690
<v 13>John,
what do you want to be a lawyer?</v>

195
00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:07.663
<v 4>John.</v>

196
00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:11.460
<v 13>John,
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
What was the question?</v>

197
00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:14.340
I was asking why do you want to be a lawyer?

198
00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:21.290
<v 1>Ah,</v>

199
00:17:26.610 --> 00:17:27.443
dear Daniel,

200
00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:31.230
you've always been there for me and supported my passion for filmmaking.

201
00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:32.760
Even as kids,

202
00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:36.660
you helped me make my first film and even more that ridiculous superhero
costume.

203
00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:38.790
You'll always be my hero.

204
00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:43.470
Thank you for believing in me and teaching me how to live my life to the fullest

205
00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:46.020
and encouraging me to take the road less traveled.

206
00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:49.560
I know I wouldn't be here without you and for that

207
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:50.850
<v 9>I just want to thank you.</v>

208
00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:02.083
<v 10>Yeah,</v>

209
00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:22.140
<v 9>man.
I miss you so much as I take this next step in life,</v>

210
00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:27.030
I have no idea what lies ahead,
but thanks to you.
I do know this.

211
00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:30.630
A life with passion is a life worth living

212
00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:47.523
<v 3>bodily,</v>

213
00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:38.183
<v 10>right?</v>

214
00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:41.060
<v 0>Left,
right,
left,
right,
left.</v>
