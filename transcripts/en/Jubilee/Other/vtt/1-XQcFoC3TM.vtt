1
00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.120
All right,
well let's do it.
Okay,

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.160
so we're here on our first day of shooting for the why I sing music video.

3
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.100
So this shots and Mba side is still running his heart out.

4
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.100
Is there like some real inspiration for this song?
Is there a girl or just,
um,

5
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.060
I just,
I wrote it basically

6
00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.910
<v 1>for what I would want in a relationship.
Right,
right.</v>

7
00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.200
<v 0>What?
Everyone looks fine.
So the ideal girl,
if you're out there,</v>

8
00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.500
this is for you and find us fine.
Phil,

9
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:35.870
we're in DC and they see you street and flagger come out talking to be driving

10
00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.291
that.

11
00:00:38.291 --> 00:00:42.220
He's going to be hanging out out of the car here and then Miss Tasha is going to

12
00:00:42.221 --> 00:00:43.054
be like doing,

13
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.410
this isn't like the most ghetto production set up ever.
Why are you smiling?

14
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.320
It's a little too smiley.
Girlfriend just died.
Your girlfriends in the hospital.

15
00:00:56.321 --> 00:01:00.940
You gotta be more,
yeah,
that's right.
One with the eyes.
The less,
less smile.

16
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.933
A little bit more.

17
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.140
<v 2>Ah,</v>

18
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.020
<v 0>no smile.
No smile.
Those smile.
Most moms,</v>

19
00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.930
it's going to be all in the eyes,
man.
Like that'd be teary.
Close your mouth.

20
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.110
10 Buck your face a little bit just to cover it up.

21
00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.240
<v 3>Ah,</v>

22
00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.130
<v 0>one faster or man fell is taking a break because I think he's been running a</v>

23
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.510
little bit too much.
I can't believe Phyllis throwing up right now.

24
00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.490
It feels not feeling so well.
No,
I feel guilty.
I feel like it's my fault.

25
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.520
I ate a two third pound burger with fries three hours ago and that has come out

26
00:01:43.311 --> 00:01:47.800
already.
Even have that much food and then running is always not a good idea.

27
00:01:47.801 --> 00:01:50.500
It's not like you just running that you're running as fast as you've ever run.

28
00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.740
Yes I can.
To follow a car.
Sorry.

29
00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.560
Just so y'all know,
we're making this video for a hepatitis.

30
00:02:02.561 --> 00:02:07.260
Be aware of this is a serious issue,
especially for us Asian Americans.

31
00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.960
It's something that I community deals with a lot.

32
00:02:09.961 --> 00:02:14.460
So make sure you get tested and make sure you are aware one in 10,

33
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.820
one in 10 that Asian Americans have hepatitis B

34
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.290
hold on a whole lot of any tears.

35
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.730
His Irish cops following us for the last 20 minutes now.

36
00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.300
So Phil is trying to explain to the cops that we are.

37
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.090
<v 1>Okay.
Thank you.
All right.
Just give us a warning.</v>

38
00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.170
All right.

39
00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.770

41
00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.580
<v 0>Jason,

That's what it is.</v>

42
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.060
<v 1>Just the half of the shot.</v>

43
00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:05.383
Jason's going to

44
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:11.373
cry.

45
00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:22.070
He showed me how to act because clearly I can't

46
00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.190
scared.
Surprised.

47
00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.950
Oh my God.

Disappointed.

54
00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:04.340

Really Sad.

Yeah.
Okay.

63
00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:08.740
That's a little bit different from what I imagine.

64
00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:14.460
It's like a [inaudible]

65
00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:27.213
