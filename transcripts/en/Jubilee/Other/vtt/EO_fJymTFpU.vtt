1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.730
I don't want people to look down upon me for having a gay son.

2
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.480
<v 1>Our kids don't exist to bolster our reputation.
A child is amazing,</v>

3
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.010
but I can't rely on her to do that.
That's not her role.

4
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.870
The Voice of God is the still small voice inside your own heart and that voice

5
00:00:14.871 --> 00:00:18.090
is saying let love do what love does.

6
00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.470
<v 0>I'm Adam Greenwald.
I'm a husband.</v>

7
00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.310
I'm a rabbi and I'm the director of the Miller introduction to Judaism program

8
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.630
at American Jewish University.

9
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.490
<v 3>Hi,
I'm Adam Edgerly.
I am a husband,</v>

10
00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.880
father of a daughter and pastor of new Song La Church.

11
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.890
<v 4>My name is Amy Boyle.
I am an atheist,</v>

12
00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.930
a humanist and the director of a local secular community Sunday assembly Los

13
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.083
Angeles.

14
00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.620
<v 5>Okay.</v>

15
00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.490
<v 3>My mother smokes weed and I hate it.
I know it's her house,</v>

16
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.870
but she is always smoking like what?
16 year olds,

17
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.990
parent hot boxes,
the living room.

18
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.120
How do I confront her?

19
00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.010
<v 4>Maybe you could talk to your mother,</v>

20
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.820
but also in the context of lifting to any concerns or annoyances she might have

21
00:01:16.071 --> 00:01:18.440
so you can give a little and take a little

22
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.450
<v 0>showing your kid.</v>

23
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.110
The image of somebody who sits around and smokes weed all day.

24
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.670
It's not only the vice of smoking marijuana,

25
00:01:28.671 --> 00:01:31.100
whether that's such a serious vice or not,

26
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.450
it's how you're using that opportunity of parenthood.

27
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.530
<v 4>I want to respect the fact that we're only hearing half,</v>

28
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.281
half the story.
Like you said,

29
00:01:41.281 --> 00:01:45.900
we don't know if there's like a chronic pain issue or what the rest of that

30
00:01:45.901 --> 00:01:47.760
story looks like.
It seems like the conversation,

31
00:01:47.761 --> 00:01:50.820
you'd almost want to direct it away from the substance and talk about let's go

32
00:01:50.821 --> 00:01:54.090
deeper.
Plf feel it.
You know what's really going on there.

33
00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.300
<v 3>When I ended my pot-smoking days,</v>

34
00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.840
it was my mother that got me to stop and she didn't get me to stop by ordering

35
00:01:59.841 --> 00:02:03.650
me to stop.
It was because I saw how it affected her.

36
00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.200
When you're living in your parent's home,
you have to respect your parents rules.

37
00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.450
I would suggest pleading with mom saying,

38
00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.480
this is how it's impacting me because when I saw my mother grieving over what

39
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.490
was happening to me and it was basically she saw me wasting my potential.

40
00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.090
I saw the pain and that's what convinced me to stop.

41
00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:24.270
<v 5>Okay.</v>

42
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.710
<v 4>I posted a Ryan Reynolds Deadpool meme about how Santa isn't real on Facebook</v>

43
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.280
and my 13 year old niece side and told my 11 year old niece,

44
00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:33.960
they are devastated.

45
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.490
My sister and parents are angry at me and want to lie about Santa being real.

46
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.250
I don't think it's healthy to do so at their ages.

47
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.610
What can I do to smooth things over?
Well,

48
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.860
<v 0>so I'm the Jew with the table.
[inaudible] right.
Um,
so that was me.
I did also,</v>

49
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.630
I played Santa Claus for a couple of years at a children's hospital on Christmas

50
00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.900
Eve.

51
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.900
So I think that I may be the only rabbi in America who also has my resume,

52
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.900
a time in which I was playing Santa.

53
00:03:01.901 --> 00:03:06.520
But through college I would put on the red suit and Schlep around a Gurney of

54
00:03:06.521 --> 00:03:07.750
presence from room to room.

55
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.140
And I got to the room of this 1516 year old gang member who had been shot.

56
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.970
And I opened the door and he took one look at me and he leapt out of bed.

57
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.960
He was so excited to see Santa Claus and I'm thinking like,

58
00:03:22.961 --> 00:03:24.790
here's this kid.
Hold on.

59
00:03:24.791 --> 00:03:29.320
One hand is out getting shot in the street involved in gang activity.

60
00:03:29.321 --> 00:03:32.800
On the other hand,
when Santa comes to his door in his hospital room,

61
00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.950
he just wants to give Santa a hug and I think in that moment I got a little bit

62
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.400
of why that magic is important in a way that I'd never understood as a Jew

63
00:03:42.401 --> 00:03:43.070
before.

64
00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.970
<v 3>Oh,
interesting perspective because of my Christian faith,</v>

65
00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.360
I told my daughter from the very beginning,
there is no Santa Claus.

66
00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.740
I think it can be damaging if,
especially as people of faith,

67
00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.430
there are a lot of things that we're going to be teaching our children that may

68
00:03:58.431 --> 00:04:00.490
be difficult to believe,
right?

69
00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.060
So it's challenging to believe in the creator that you can't see and so forth.

70
00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.740
I don't think we need to be lying to our kids and then later on tell him what we

71
00:04:09.741 --> 00:04:12.200
lied about that,
but we were telling the truth about this.

72
00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.710
I think that's a credibility problem.
In this particular case though,

73
00:04:15.711 --> 00:04:17.300
I want to speak specifically to this case.

74
00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:21.860
If the kid has already heard that there's no Santa Grieve with the child,

75
00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.360
don't reinforce the lie because it's going to come out later and it'll be worse

76
00:04:26.361 --> 00:04:26.960
later.

77
00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.700
<v 4>I'm an atheist and I have four year old,
uh,
and we,</v>

78
00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.970
we decided to to have Santa's be real for them.

79
00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:40.120
My husband and I both really loved that magic and that sense of wonder and also

80
00:04:41.271 --> 00:04:44.750
because we thought that that makes a good teachable moment,

81
00:04:44.751 --> 00:04:47.990
that process of kids figuring that out.

82
00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.770
I also really respect the choice that you made advice for this person.

83
00:04:51.771 --> 00:04:55.970
I think just being honest about where your intention came from,
right?

84
00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:00.500
That you weren't trying to spoil anything or make them grow up before they were

85
00:05:00.501 --> 00:05:04.340
ready.
And I think if,
if a child stops believing in Santa,

86
00:05:04.341 --> 00:05:07.290
that's it's because they're ready.
Hi,

87
00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.590
grandfather molested me when I was a child.

88
00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.970
I told my father and he didn't do anything about it.
17 years later,

89
00:05:13.971 --> 00:05:17.390
my grandfather is now dying and my family wants me to visit him.

90
00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.110
I think confronting my dad and telling the rest of my family would not be well

91
00:05:21.111 --> 00:05:23.540
timed.
Do I tell my mom and confront my dad?

92
00:05:23.541 --> 00:05:27.440
Now do I tell them that I can't say why I won't be visiting,

93
00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.900
but that'll tell them in a few months after my grandfather's death.

94
00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.720
<v 3>I don't believe that you have a responsibility to go visit your grandfather.</v>

95
00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:41.200
I appreciate your love for your parents and your willingness to not spoil their

96
00:05:42.741 --> 00:05:46.370
time of grief for him,
but the fact is they should have protected you.

97
00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:52.390
Forgiveness comes after a taking of responsibility by the person who committed

98
00:05:53.391 --> 00:05:58.340
the act as there's been no taking of responsibility.
You don't owe him

99
00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:59.413
<v 0>anything.</v>

100
00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:02.200
<v 4>Actually,
I think it's possible to forgive when,</v>

101
00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:05.710
when there is an acknowledgement of wrongdoing.
Uh,

102
00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:07.660
but I think it's hard and I don't think it's owed.

103
00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:09.480
<v 3>I would agree with that.</v>

104
00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:12.990
I would make a distinction between forgiveness and reconciliation.

105
00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:13.950
Reconciliation is

106
00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:18.500
<v 0>flooring of the relationship.
I think forgiveness can be unilateral.</v>

107
00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.560
Sometimes people feel like in order to forgive,

108
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:26.580
they need to be able to empathize with the person who victimized them.
Um,

109
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.350
and so I much prefer there's a,

110
00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.800
there's a concept that comes out of the Jewish tradition called,
Yay.
Gosh.

111
00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:37.070
When you've lost something and you know you're never going to get it back.
Hmm.

112
00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:41.930
What may be we're counseling together is,

113
00:06:41.931 --> 00:06:46.520
is there a way to take this burden off of your heart so you can walk away a

114
00:06:46.521 --> 00:06:47.960
little bit freer?
Right.
Yeah.

115
00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:53.240
<v 4>It sounds like we all agree that there's nothing owed to the grandfather or</v>

116
00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:59.030
maybe even the parents and then the situation.

117
00:06:59.031 --> 00:07:03.650
There's just coping with this however they can.

118
00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:04.723
Yeah.

119
00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:08.410
<v 0>My son recently came out to my wife and I as gay,</v>

120
00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.120
but I'm having a hard time accepting it.

121
00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:13.750
My parents always told me growing up that homosexuality is wrong.

122
00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:17.230
I don't want people to look down upon me for having a gay son.

123
00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.090
I still love my son.

124
00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:24.190
I'm just having a hard time coming to grips with his sexuality.
Hmm.
Wow.

125
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.110
That's a very honest post.

126
00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:32.010
<v 3>Showing love and acceptance for your son has to be more important than your own</v>

127
00:07:32.011 --> 00:07:35.430
personal reputation.
Our kids don't exist to bolster our reputation.

128
00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:39.330
My child is amazing,
but I can't rely on her to do that.

129
00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:42.240
That's not her role.
Coming out of the Christian tradition,

130
00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:46.790
how sex is expressed is pretty narrow and pretty clear in scripture.
Um,

131
00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:52.020
I think that doesn't supersede the command to love and respect everyone and

132
00:07:52.021 --> 00:07:53.820
especially a member of your own family.

133
00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:54.943
<v 0>Amen,
pastor.</v>

134
00:07:56.180 --> 00:08:01.180
Part of our obligation as leaders in spiritual traditions or in wisdom

135
00:08:02.841 --> 00:08:07.841
traditions is to give people the permission to trust the voice inside of them,

136
00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:11.030
right?

137
00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:14.870
A lot of people put a lot more weight on the voice that comes through the book

138
00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:17.960
or the voice that came through the preacher,
the voice of God.

139
00:08:17.961 --> 00:08:22.010
However you understand that is the still small voice inside your own heart.

140
00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:27.080
That voice is saying you need to grow and you need to let love do what love

141
00:08:27.201 --> 00:08:29.030
does,
which is to win out in the end.

142
00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:34.080
<v 4>That voice,
as a secular person,
I have that as well.</v>

143
00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:36.690
We just don't call it God.

144
00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:40.470
It's sort of liberating not to be bound to dogma or scripture or something that

145
00:08:40.471 --> 00:08:43.410
might come into conflict with what it actually feels.
Right.

146
00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:46.440
Your son came out to you and gave you that gift of trusting you.

147
00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:49.800
It sounds like he believes that your relationship is strong enough and it sounds

148
00:08:49.801 --> 00:08:54.180
like you were ready.
Uh,
so I,
I do think you're most of the way there,

149
00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:59.420
<v 6>one thing I is that we all recognized the fathers urge to love and accept his</v>

150
00:09:01.141 --> 00:09:05.610
son and he's asking how do I get there and that we all affirm get there.

151
00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:10.560
Right?
Would you say that's true?
Yeah.
He's counting on you.

152
00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:17.010
We're all dealing with the same stuff even more than the answers around the

153
00:09:17.011 --> 00:09:21.030
table.
The questions were for me,
a reminder of our common humanity.

154
00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:26.120
<v 4>So many places,
15 lake,
we were coming from the same place.
Um,
and that our,</v>

155
00:09:26.121 --> 00:09:29.860
our moral instincts are the same.
Uh,

156
00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:35.240
we find inspiration and attribute the origin of those instincts from Dan,

157
00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:37.230
sometimes different places.

158
00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:41.100
<v 6>Talking to people from different backgrounds is very helpful.</v>

159
00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:44.580
I think that when we isolate,
we are the poorer for it.

160
00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:49.570
Hey guys,
