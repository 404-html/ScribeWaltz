1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.060
Telling a woman she should do something is actually antifeminist we're told all

2
00:00:06.091 --> 00:00:08.580
the time from so many people what we should be,

3
00:00:08.581 --> 00:00:13.290
how we should ask the question and it goes against what I believe as a feminist

4
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:14.183
anyway.

5
00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.963
<v 1>Okay.</v>

6
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:30.203
Okay.

7
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.230
<v 0>I know</v>

8
00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.880
<v 1>three,
two.
Wow.</v>

9
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.750
<v 0>Like I know like step one through five but like to actually do it,</v>

10
00:00:47.751 --> 00:00:51.350
I don't think I can like be confident enough to just do it,
you know?
Yeah.

11
00:00:51.351 --> 00:00:53.990
I didn't know there were five steps anyways,
so that's why I'm here.

12
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.310
Like I have changed my tire multiple times,

13
00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.650
just shows that I'm not a great driver,

14
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.100
but I learned myself and I had to because I popped my tire left

15
00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:13.940
<v 1>three,
two,</v>

16
00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.430
<v 0>there shouldn't be any difference in the fundamental life things that we all</v>

17
00:01:26.431 --> 00:01:29.460
should know.
And I think that if we were all raised the same,

18
00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.790
there wouldn't be pay differences.
Like we'd all have this,

19
00:01:31.791 --> 00:01:35.100
we'd all be on the same slate.
So maybe I'll switch it to a degree.

20
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.020
I actually don't want kids,
but if I were to decide to do that,

21
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.580
I would want them to grow up in that environment where there's no difference

22
00:01:44.581 --> 00:01:45.414
between you two.

23
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.290
You don't have like a curfew that she doesn't have or vice versa.

24
00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:50.260
I agree with you,

25
00:01:50.261 --> 00:01:55.261
but I also think that we have like where we are now,

26
00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.130
we wish there was a perfect world so we want to raise our kids and say treat

27
00:02:00.131 --> 00:02:02.110
everyone the same.
Yes,
absolutely.

28
00:02:02.111 --> 00:02:06.460
You treat everyone the same but recognize that not everyone believes that way.

29
00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.520
I'm like if we teach our boys the responsibility that they have not taking

30
00:02:11.981 --> 00:02:14.830
advantage of someone when they've had too much to drink.

31
00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.860
I just think that there's an awareness that you have to teach boys being men and

32
00:02:21.401 --> 00:02:24.250
also girls like becoming women

33
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.133
feminists.

34
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.480
<v 1>Okay.
Three.
Two.</v>

35
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.540
Okay.

36
00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.540
<v 0>I just think that feminism in recent years have just become extreme ones like</v>

37
00:02:46.291 --> 00:02:51.030
the 60s it's likely if you're a feminist then like your anti and tight hands

38
00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.330
like you know,
I don't think it should be anti man.

39
00:02:54.331 --> 00:02:58.290
I think we should all be empowering men to support women to write and bringing

40
00:02:58.291 --> 00:03:01.750
them into the conversation.
I think right now feminism is like,
we don't need you.

41
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.240
Right?
Do I agree with that?

42
00:03:04.241 --> 00:03:09.241
But also I think that women have been put down for so long that we kind of need

43
00:03:10.271 --> 00:03:14.830
to go a little bit extreme in the opposite direction just so that we can come to

44
00:03:14.831 --> 00:03:19.600
the middle because otherwise the men aren't going to meet us in the middle.
Well,

45
00:03:19.601 --> 00:03:24.601
feminism by default is sort of the idea to make decisions for yourself and what

46
00:03:25.481 --> 00:03:30.481
fuels you and telling a woman she should do something is actually antifeminist

47
00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.500
because we're told all the time from so many people what we should be,

48
00:03:39.501 --> 00:03:42.530
how we should act,
how we should address,
how we should communicate.

49
00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.210
So the question,
and it goes against what I believe as a feminist.

50
00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:48.103
Anyway,

51
00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:55.593
<v 1>one,</v>

52
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.200
here we go.
Hi Guys.

53
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:09.370
<v 0>Uh,
I think it's circumstantial because I do believe there are instances where if</v>

54
00:04:09.371 --> 00:04:10.600
the mother is,

55
00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.440
I'm going to be severely harmed by a birth,

56
00:04:14.441 --> 00:04:17.980
that that is where abortion would be.
Okay.
In my belief,

57
00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.030
and I think it also the exception also would be in the cases of rape.
Um,

58
00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.200
but all other circumstances where you made a choice.
I'm pro pro life,

59
00:04:26.201 --> 00:04:29.680
I think we all deserve a chance at life.
So I definitely stuck in the,

60
00:04:29.681 --> 00:04:31.060
I agree with that statement,

61
00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.410
but I feel like the heavier restrictions that are placed on it by our government

62
00:04:35.411 --> 00:04:38.560
just dictating what we can do with our bodies is really infuriating.

63
00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.610
And then seeing people who have kids and resent it for the rest of their lives

64
00:04:42.611 --> 00:04:46.180
and raising children that they never wanted.
It's frustrating.

65
00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.270
And so do you think that those parents that are struggling with raising their

66
00:04:49.271 --> 00:04:54.070
children that they didn't have the option for adoption or other ways?
It depends.

67
00:04:54.071 --> 00:04:57.010
Like for a lot of cultures adoption is not okay.

68
00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.900
So they would not be able to do that.

69
00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:07.043
<v 1>Wow.</v>

70
00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.590
<v 0>Taste fully is the word that I,
that comes to mind.</v>

71
00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.560
Like I enjoy a tasteful,

72
00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:26.180
you look fantastic.
Right?
That's true.

73
00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.440
If it's wanted it's fine,
but then like you can't mind read,
how would you know?

74
00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:33.770
We've all had like bad flirting experiences.

75
00:05:33.771 --> 00:05:36.410
But then like I'm thinking there's a couple I've had where they're like,

76
00:05:36.411 --> 00:05:38.630
excuse me,
I just wanted to let you know you're very beautiful,

77
00:05:38.631 --> 00:05:42.150
please have a nice day.
And I'm like,
okay,
thank you.

78
00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:46.640
You know,
and like something like that that's like short and sweet and there's no

79
00:05:46.641 --> 00:05:49.830
expiration shit.
I think that's the thing.
I mean,
and I'm from,

80
00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.890
and I'm from New York,
so I'm just like automatically on autopilot.

81
00:05:52.891 --> 00:05:55.830
I don't talk to me to look at me like my whole life you had the cat calls,

82
00:05:55.831 --> 00:05:59.780
but you have like the derogatory cat calls off or I don't look at you if I don't

83
00:05:59.781 --> 00:06:03.770
speak to you,
I'm a be,
I'm,
I'm all of these things.
But it's like,

84
00:06:03.771 --> 00:06:05.870
but if I did gave you the time of day,
then what would I be?

85
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.940
And I don't think like every guy is like that,

86
00:06:07.941 --> 00:06:12.360
but it's just so much easier and safer.
Yeah.

87
00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:15.960
Assume that nothing is in,
it's not a good way to live,
obviously.
But that's okay.

88
00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:20.890
<v 3>Well because then my question is is who gets let in and how do you determine who</v>

89
00:06:20.891 --> 00:06:23.070
gets let in and how do you function

90
00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.530
<v 0>if they start the,
I guess,</v>

91
00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:29.340
relationship in a non romantic or sexual way?

92
00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:30.750
Like if it's not like a flirty,

93
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.700
it's just like you just meet people places and they just talk to you.
Yeah,

94
00:06:34.701 --> 00:06:36.270
you can just talk to you like a normal person.

95
00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.920
<v 1>Three,
two.
Why?</v>

96
00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:51.340
<v 0>Well at the heart of it,</v>

97
00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:56.370
I think that the me too movement is about women that have been in situations,

98
00:06:56.981 --> 00:06:58.720
whether it's work or personal,

99
00:06:58.721 --> 00:07:03.721
where they haven't been in a safe space to speak up or share and the burden

100
00:07:04.931 --> 00:07:09.931
that's on us to protect men or other people by not speaking.

101
00:07:09.971 --> 00:07:13.600
What has happened to us is actually can be like PTSD.

102
00:07:13.601 --> 00:07:15.100
It's like traumatic to your system.

103
00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:20.101
Like I experienced going through being sexually harassed and this happened in

104
00:07:21.401 --> 00:07:24.230
2013 and I still have never come out about it.

105
00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:28.500
<v 3>Statistically speaking,
like the number of women who are raped,</v>

106
00:07:28.501 --> 00:07:33.501
there's exponentially more than who actually report it.

107
00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:38.700
So when I think about the me too movement,
like there's strength in numbers,

108
00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:40.740
you know,
when it started I was like,

109
00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:45.780
I don't know if I want to post about this.
I don't know how I feel.

110
00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:50.760
But what it did do was it gave me the strength to actually share with someone

111
00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:51.560
else.

112
00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:53.810
<v 0>I like,
I'm realizing as everyone's talking,</v>

113
00:07:53.811 --> 00:07:58.811
like the reason I'm not in that line is because when me too was a big movement,

114
00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:03.050
I didn't have the strength or courage to be a part of it.

115
00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:06.320
So in my mind it's like still there of like if I,

116
00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.310
I didn't have the courage to be a part of the movement and I still don't have

117
00:08:10.311 --> 00:08:13.340
the courage to stand in that line because it's almost admitting that I've had

118
00:08:13.341 --> 00:08:15.260
like multiple things happen,
you know?

119
00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:19.240
And so you're representing all of the other women that feel the same way and

120
00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:21.800
they see you and they relate to you on that.

121
00:08:21.801 --> 00:08:24.260
So you're helping other women by saying that.

122
00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:25.413
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

123
00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:33.210
Three,
two,
one.

124
00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:40.140
Ooh,

125
00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:40.650
<v 0>okay.</v>

126
00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:43.920
How is that any different than saying I believe that the world would be better

127
00:08:43.921 --> 00:08:47.490
for it.
We run by men like if we're going to say that on this token we get that.

128
00:08:47.491 --> 00:08:49.170
On that token,
that's not even balanced.

129
00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:53.870
I think what my thought processes is in the current state that we're in right

130
00:08:53.871 --> 00:08:54.704
now,

131
00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:59.490
then think that it would be once we get to the place where we are able to raise

132
00:08:59.491 --> 00:09:03.030
our children the same way and like women aren't afraid to like go outside and

133
00:09:03.031 --> 00:09:05.280
like guys don't have like toxic masculinity.

134
00:09:05.281 --> 00:09:08.460
Then it's like anybody can run the country and like it's all going to be the

135
00:09:08.461 --> 00:09:09.840
same because we're all raised the same.

136
00:09:09.841 --> 00:09:12.300
But I think for right now in the place that we're in,

137
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.690
I think women have a better understanding of that,

138
00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:19.320
but I think it's hard because when you have little boys that are growing up that

139
00:09:19.321 --> 00:09:23.940
are just not even accountable or nor should they be for things that men their

140
00:09:23.941 --> 00:09:28.020
father's might've done or their grandfathers and then saying like woman should

141
00:09:28.021 --> 00:09:28.890
be running the world.

142
00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:32.070
It's the same thing where how is that different than in the 1957 year old little

143
00:09:32.071 --> 00:09:35.640
girls were told men should be in positions of power.

144
00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:40.500
Maybe if we had more women in leadership in c suite,
in,
in,
in,
in Congress.

145
00:09:40.501 --> 00:09:42.870
Like what if we have more women in leadership period.

146
00:09:42.871 --> 00:09:44.610
It doesn't have to be running the world maybe,

147
00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:49.110
but if we just had more women and women of color,
different backgrounds,

148
00:09:49.111 --> 00:09:52.530
like if we had more diversity in general in leadership around the world,

149
00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:53.730
it would be a better place.

150
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.090
That's why I chose this one too cause I don't think it should be one or the

151
00:09:57.091 --> 00:10:00.720
other.
I definitely think that uh,
what,
it's only a mountain run.

152
00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:02.250
They're missing the rest of society.

153
00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:06.180
You can't really operate the world or any government or leadership if you're not

154
00:10:06.181 --> 00:10:08.190
embracing the second half of society.

155
00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:11.700
I think the problem with what some people think feminism is,

156
00:10:11.701 --> 00:10:14.760
is that you have to bring people down in order to raise people up.

157
00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:16.140
But you don't have to do that.

158
00:10:16.141 --> 00:10:21.030
Like you can raise women up to be in positions of power without pushing men
down.

159
00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:24.720
And I think that that is a misconception with feminism.

160
00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:28.430
<v 1>Okay.</v>

161
00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:29.263
<v 0>I need water.</v>
