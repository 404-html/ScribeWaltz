1
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:23.803
Yeah.

2
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.010
Really Nice drive up there,
Austin.

3
00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.990
I can tell you've been working on for your heart,
for that scholar.
Really

4
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.610
just keep doing whatever it is you're doing.
All right.

5
00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.003
Okay.

6
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.953
Sorry.

7
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.860
<v 1>Good out there,
man.
Secret what?
Ah,
nothing.</v>

8
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.130
Okay.
Well,
hey a team dinner tonight at my place.
You come in.
Um,

9
00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.050
no.
I'm going to drop this off and let me get some more practice in this practice

10
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.850
for two and a half hours.
This.
Yeah,
but I heard this,
this gal coming.

11
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.920
You've got to be on top of my game.
You know I need that scholarship.
Well,

12
00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.230
alright,
come after.
You'll be starving since you never eat.

13
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.150
And my mom is making our pasta.

14
00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.020
Yeah.
Okay,
sure.
Fine.
I'm either cool.
Sweet.
All right.

15
00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.260
Hey
Jason,

16
00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.330
what are you doing here?
I don't know.
He never showed up.

17
00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.480
Didn't answer any of my calls or my texts that I could find you here and this,

18
00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.130
the dinner.
Okay,
so what,
what does it even matter to you?

19
00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.250
Seriously,
my bad for Karen.

20
00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.350
<v 0>Hey.
Hey.</v>

21
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.300
<v 1>All right man,
let's stop.
Stop.
Dude.
I'm fine.</v>

22
00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.220
Okay.
I don't need a babysitter.
You don't look fine.

23
00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.240
I've got it under control.
Okay.

24
00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.883
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

25
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.883
Hey,

26
00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:05.770
<v 1>I'm going to be straight up.</v>

27
00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:07.893
<v 0>Do you need help?</v>

28
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.170
Whatever it is you're doing to yourself,
it's not worth it.
Right?

29
00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.720
<v 1>All Right,
gentlemen,
now you're in for a treat today.
Time trials.
This.</v>

30
00:06:23.721 --> 00:06:25.160
Have everybody up on the blocks here.

31
00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:29.100
<v 0>No,
it'll be worth it.</v>

32
00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:33.990
<v 1>Swimmers.
Take your mark.</v>

33
00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:53.943
<v 0>Okay.</v>

34
00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:38.300
It's
okay.

35
00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:46.090
<v 1>Hey,
what is this anyway?
Leave me alone please.</v>

36
00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:51.940
I don't think you understand what just happened.
Yes,
actually I do.
Oh,
really?

37
00:07:51.941 --> 00:07:52.774
Yes.

38
00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:57.860
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

39
00:07:57.860 --> 00:07:58.970
<v 1>I just lost everything.</v>

40
00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:03.990
Everything that I've worked for as a swimmer gone.

41
00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:05.623
<v 0>Okay.</v>

42
00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:09.450
<v 1>You know,
I spend every day,</v>

43
00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:14.040
if you're waking hour at this pool and I swim more laps,

44
00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.930
then every member of this team combined.

45
00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:17.610
<v 0>Okay.</v>

46
00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:19.440
<v 1>You know how much I needed the scholarship?</v>

47
00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:23.790
Do you know damn well what it's been like for me at home?

48
00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:28.890
All I had left a swimming.

49
00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:34.753
You just don't get it.

50
00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:39.290
Is that all that matters to you?

51
00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:47.490
You got some swimming machine?
All right,
man.
You're a person,
a friend,

52
00:08:47.491 --> 00:08:48.870
someone who has cared for,

53
00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:53.940
but right now I can't even tell who you are.

54
00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:51.090
<v 0>Tony,
get something to eat.</v>

55
00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:00.133
Yeah.

56
00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:19.290
Oh.
