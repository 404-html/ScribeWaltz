1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.710
So my biggest problem was,
dude,

2
00:00:01.711 --> 00:00:06.711
I looked up to you like you were my fucking idol growing up.

3
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.290
And then for this to happen,
I was just like,
fuck.

4
00:00:10.291 --> 00:00:12.450
Why is my brother one of those assholes,
you know?

5
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.550
Uh,
my name is Devin.
I'm Kelly.

6
00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.380
My relationship with my brother is old,
best friend,
new best friend.

7
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.560
My relationship with Kelly is humble.
The big brother,

8
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.370
uh,
seeking had venture partner.

9
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:39.403
<v 1>When you're ready,</v>

10
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.680
<v 0>I am a positive person.
Yes or no?</v>

11
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.230
<v 1>One,
two,
three,</v>

12
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.920
<v 0>a surprise.
I think you're both,
I mean,
there's levels.</v>

13
00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.420
I'm positive with other people.
I like to hype.
I'm a hype man.

14
00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:08.140
Your hype man.
I like tie people up.
So yeah,

15
00:01:08.141 --> 00:01:11.020
I'm positive when it comes out words,
but

16
00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.000
you know,
I see people around you and no one's like,
oh,

17
00:01:16.001 --> 00:01:17.440
I don't want to hang around Kelly.

18
00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.860
She's negative people like hanging around you and being around you.
So

19
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.050
I have felt judged by you.

20
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.720
<v 1>One,
two,
three.</v>

21
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.120
<v 0>I was present.
I won.
I felt judged by you.
All right,
go on.</v>

22
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:45.160
Always felt judged by you.
Uh,
you didn't even want to hang out with me.

23
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.880
God is really critical on you.
I know,

24
00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.830
I'm very aware and all my friends and they're very aware.

25
00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.030
I was critical of your friends too.
Oh yeah.

26
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.980
Everyone could see the judgment all over you

27
00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.410
and just exuberated judgment on us.
Interesting.

28
00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.240
I totally judged you at one point when judging you right now,
dude,

29
00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.940
we're wearing the same color shirt.
Lights off.

30
00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.730
I feel understood by you.
One,
two,

31
00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:22.623
three,

32
00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.020
out of everyone in the world said by you the most,

33
00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.690
even with that whatever gap,
15 years,
how long did we not

34
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.290
know?
Um

35
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:39.713
<v 1>hmm.</v>

36
00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:45.560
<v 0>So Deb and I were really close growing up.
Uh,
I mean,</v>

37
00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.160
I dunno,
we wait.
We went separate ways.
Uh,
I,
uh,

38
00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.230
I took a very dark path.

39
00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.300
I got into drugs in high school.
Um,

40
00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.410
I had a disgusting that I just couldn't get out of Devin went to school and was

41
00:03:06.511 --> 00:03:10.650
in a serious relationship and,
uh,
I don't know.
We,
we,

42
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.790
we took very different paths.

43
00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.910
<v 2>Yeah.
So we didn't talk though.
That was like,
yeah,
he told me,
fuck myself.</v>

44
00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.840
Those are the only words you said.
Two years.

45
00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.980
Mom told us we had to say hello to each other

46
00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.870
<v 0>and we,
we met on the stairs and he just screamed in my face</v>

47
00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.490
and then I left and I left.
When did you leave?

48
00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.460
17 moved out,
Steve.

49
00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:39.771
But anyway,

50
00:03:39.771 --> 00:03:44.771
we didn't really talk and I was going through something weird and I told my mom,

51
00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.400
I'm going to go to Amsterdam.
I booked my ticket and I'm leaving.
And she goes,

52
00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:54.020
ask [inaudible] if he wants to go with you.
I'm like,
uh,
no.

53
00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.300
Asked Devon four months ago with you.
I thought about it and I was like,
actually,

54
00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.710
yeah,
let's see what's up,
what he's doing.
So I called Devin and it was like,

55
00:04:03.711 --> 00:04:04.340
hey mom,

56
00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.320
mom wants me to ask you to come to answer down with me and I'm starting to

57
00:04:09.321 --> 00:04:14.060
believe I can't go alone.
Uh,
what do you,
what are you doing?

58
00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.930
We fucking did it.
It was a crazy,
crazy experience.

59
00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.110
And we've been,
we've been communicating a lot recently.

60
00:04:24.111 --> 00:04:28.130
Devins a good support system for me.
Likewise.
Likewise.

61
00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.600
So it's cool.
We're friends again.
Yeah.
You Ready?
I'm ready.

62
00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.250
That's me.
Yeah,
that's true.

63
00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:38.763
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

64
00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:40.960
<v 0>I am a good person.</v>

65
00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.530
All right.
One,
two,
three.

66
00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.220
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

67
00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.520
<v 0>I've been told the last like three years.
I'm no horrible person.
Um,</v>

68
00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.060
and you start to believe that stuff when you're told that over and over again.

69
00:05:03.061 --> 00:05:07.440
But
there's no way I'm a bad person.

70
00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:08.640
I care so much.

71
00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:10.920
<v 2>You're not the worst.</v>

72
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.640
You're not the worst person and not the worst person.

73
00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:21.110
I think you are a good person because I've seen people talk to you and,

74
00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:25.590
and tell me afterwards how much,
how easy it is to talk to you,

75
00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:30.330
how easy you are to be around and people gravitate towards you.

76
00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:32.330
<v 1>Okay.</v>

77
00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:36.890
<v 2>You care about people.
And I are authentic person.</v>

78
00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:38.060
Kelly Maca low.

79
00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.650
<v 0>That's funny cause that's what people say about you.</v>

80
00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:47.530
I think you're a good person.
I think we get lost.

81
00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:49.720
We get lost in our heads.

82
00:05:49.721 --> 00:05:53.740
We are so judgmental of ourselves.

83
00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:55.750
I'm like,

84
00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:00.750
those couple of years after you're divorced and stuff that was rough and like I

85
00:06:01.701 --> 00:06:03.860
could see where where you might not have felt

86
00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.370
super amazing at that moment.

87
00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:13.850
Are you doing with that?
It's a tough one.

88
00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:15.830
<v 2>For years,</v>

89
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:20.860
I was with somebody who was my best friend ever know and they're just something

90
00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:26.360
else that I wanted in life.

91
00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:31.420
And for that to be in question and I don't really have all the answers for

92
00:06:32.691 --> 00:06:33.524
everyone.

93
00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:39.520
It felt like I was Kinda in this quarter law where you know as judged a lot and

94
00:06:40.761 --> 00:06:41.594
I get it.

95
00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:43.900
<v 0>So my biggest problem was,
dude,</v>

96
00:06:43.901 --> 00:06:48.901
I looked up to you like you were my fucking idol growing up.

97
00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:53.160
And then for this to happen I was just like,
fuck,

98
00:06:53.161 --> 00:06:55.350
why is my brother one of those assholes?
You know?

99
00:06:55.650 --> 00:07:00.320
And that's Shitty of me cause we don't know what's going on in other people's

100
00:07:00.321 --> 00:07:05.300
lives.
I
broke my heart that I was such a Dick to you.

101
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:10.580
<v 2>I'm glad we're getting closer.</v>

102
00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:18.340
<v 0>One,
two,
three.
Okay,
we're in agreement.</v>

103
00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:23.360
It's nice to have a friend.
It's nice to have somebody who understand you.

104
00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:28.260
<v 2>It's great to have a totally be like again,</v>

105
00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:30.560
a little bit by my family.
Um,

106
00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:34.430
<v 0>you on the outs for a whole like three years.
So calm down,
Bro.</v>

107
00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:37.910
<v 3>You were out for a little while.</v>

108
00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:44.060
If Kelly can get that or the family.
Oh Man.
Mine's going to be easy.

109
00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:47.080
Be Easy.
Uh,

110
00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:51.580
<v 0>do family's so important.
It's so important.</v>

111
00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:54.453
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

112
00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:56.640
<v 0>I took it for granted growing up.</v>

113
00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:00.170
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

114
00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:03.870
<v 2>Well I'm glad we're closer.
You and I am glad to,
uh,</v>

115
00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:07.130
like you and I have an unspoken understanding at times.

116
00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:09.140
I don't even think it needs to be a conversation,

117
00:08:09.141 --> 00:08:13.550
but there's an element of no matter what we've gone through,
um,

118
00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:14.810
having like that,

119
00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:19.250
kind of like wink of an eye and that oil like underlying understanding

120
00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:22.263
you.

121
00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:25.790
<v 3>Okay.
We're going to be able to do something to your amber.
Yeah.
All right.</v>

122
00:08:25.791 --> 00:08:26.624
Let's see what we can do it.

123
00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:34.843
<v 1>Okay.</v>

124
00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:35.830
<v 3>Oh Shit.</v>

125
00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:43.130
