You're serious?
Yes.</v>

5
00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:28.453
<v 2>Hundred</v>

6
00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:31.210
<v 3>Boring.
Here we go.</v>

7
00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.980
My name is deandre coats and I work at University of Southern California,

8
00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.670
USC,
and I work in residence life,
student affairs.

9
00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.060
Oh,
my name is a niche.

10
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.920
I work at a health care startup as a medical scribe trainer.

11
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.990
Oh my God.
This is Romania.
I'm just Lezama.
I'm a youtuber and blogger.

12
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.550
I've been doing it since before.
Youtube was a thing since 2009 so,

13
00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.640
oh gee.
Youtube in the house.
I'll take,

14
00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.790
my name is Mike McCabe.
I'm in real estate and marketing.
I love what I do.

15
00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.740
I'm very good at what I do.
And uh,
that's my calling in life.
I found it.

16
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:12.790
I guess I'm blessed for that.

17
00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.770
<v 1>Oh,
doubles Janet.</v>

18
00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.350
That's chance.
Yeah.

19
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.590
<v 0>So how much would you chop off a limb for?</v>

20
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.530
$40 million.
What makes you feel better?

21
00:01:37.531 --> 00:01:40.590
Just a shot in the dark because that means that I'd be able to get that

22
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.160
prosthetic prosthetically put back on and I also would have a piece of mind

23
00:01:44.161 --> 00:01:47.990
because I did this for no less than 48 hours.
Yeah.
Okay.

24
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.740
I'm going to go and say 42 million.

25
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.470
I would say 100 million because I mean I'm a strong girl and my legs are strong.

26
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.140
Whoever's getting this left leg squat for days.

27
00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.720
<v 1>Yeah.
I would never chop up any lymph,
any amount of money.
I would,
however,</v>

28
00:02:01.721 --> 00:02:04.400
chop off anybody pod for someone I loved.

29
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.490
It's a cop out of God,
but I read the question,

30
00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.190
<v 0>answer then I,
okay.</v>

31
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:14.783
<v 1>Connecticut.</v>

32
00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.040
<v 0>What was the most financially desperate time of your life?</v>

33
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.840
How did you deal with it?
Oh,
they were so many.
I was a teen mom.
Single mom,

34
00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.470
you apparently you cannot sleep in a Walmart parking lot in a car with your
baby.

35
00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.510
So that was me and a wow.
I'm still here so it's all good.

36
00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:33.740
But a,
yeah,

37
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.890
good stories in college there it was one semester where I could not afford to go

38
00:02:39.561 --> 00:02:44.300
back.
I like applied for Shit,
ton of scholarships and I got one.

39
00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.970
<v 4>I'm really fortunate to have grown up and a well off family.</v>

40
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.640
My parents did a lot of the hard work,

41
00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.450
them being immigrants and the fact that my parents are incredibly supportive.

42
00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.370
I have not encountered yet

43
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.020
<v 1>and I hope I don't.
But yeah,
very blessed.</v>

44
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.900
When I was a kid we had,
uh,
we would,
um,

45
00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.050
upper middle class and then my dad went bankrupt.

46
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.610
I moved to America at 15 and a half by myself living on my grandmother's floor

47
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.030
and my father moved to Africa and so he was trying to send money and I remember

48
00:03:21.341 --> 00:03:26.020
talking to my dad and I said,
what's up?
Where's the money?

49
00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.940
You've got to pay the rent.
He said,
I don't know.
I'm sorry.

50
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:35.050
And then you realize,
oh shit.
Well not all shit.

51
00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.930
No fight or flight kind of happens.
And that's when your persona as a human,

52
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.550
you resilience comes out.
But it was the best thing that ever happened to me.

53
00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.530
Good.
Yeah.
Super,
super great.

54
00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.040
<v 4>Oh,
I gotta pay you.
Yeah,
Devede they have to pay you.
Okay,
Paul,
I'm funny.</v>

55
00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.310
I love being great.
Where were you?
Can money solve the world's problems?

56
00:04:01.311 --> 00:04:04.730
Hails to the no,
no,
no.
I disagree with that wholeheartedly.
Yes.
Again,

57
00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.640
I don't think so.
Why do you disagree?
I just do.
I think,

58
00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.590
I think money can not fix anything

59
00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.650
<v 0>in a capitalistic societies such as we have.</v>

60
00:04:12.651 --> 00:04:15.980
I feel like money equals power and so like if you don't have it,

61
00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.970
I think you don't have a say in the room and a lot of ways and so I think it

62
00:04:19.971 --> 00:04:24.500
can't fix things holistically,
but it can change status,

63
00:04:24.501 --> 00:04:26.240
which I think changes things

64
00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.780
<v 4>I'm going to stick to.
It fixes problems to a certain point.
It's,</v>

65
00:04:29.781 --> 00:04:32.930
I agree with that.
Great.
It's like to a certain point and like you know,

66
00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.380
the more money you have,
the more financial secure you are,
blah,

67
00:04:36.381 --> 00:04:39.050
Blah Blah and your happiness.
You have more options.

68
00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:43.970
But then after a point you know your happiness.
I believe plateaus.

69
00:04:43.971 --> 00:04:45.650
After you make a certain amount of money,

70
00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.720
the more money you make that doesn't have any correlation or any day money is

71
00:04:50.721 --> 00:04:53.180
not going to make you happier not to begin with.

72
00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.830
<v 1>The end of it.
What?
The answer?
The original question,
which was does money?
Yes.</v>

73
00:04:56.831 --> 00:04:58.630
It solves many,
many problems.

74
00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.960
There's certain problems that cannot be solved with money,

75
00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:07.380
but 80% of your day to day issues revolve around money.

76
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.110
<v 4>Money solves some problems with it doesn't solve everything.</v>

77
00:05:10.111 --> 00:05:14.190
It's what we're saying.
Yeah.
It gives you the resources and potential,

78
00:05:14.191 --> 00:05:15.330
but it's not a done deal.

79
00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.310
Answer this question or pay $100 to the bank.
If you don't answer this question,

80
00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:26.440
how much do you make?
And my previous job,
I made 20 an hour.

81
00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:30.870
I Made 47 K I bid on a bellows,

82
00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:32.660
add a lot of brand deals.
Last year I made

83
00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.780
FY one $253,

84
00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.150
which I probably will because I'm going to beat everybody.

85
00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.980
I've been into solo traveling recently,
so I'd probably take that 250 bucks,

86
00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:50.240
get an airfare ticket.

87
00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.060
<v 0>I have tried to be better with saving.
Um,</v>

88
00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:58.250
so 250 it doesn't sound like a whole lot at the moment,
but I think if I got it,

89
00:05:58.251 --> 00:05:58.870
I'd try to

90
00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:59.680
<v 3>save some of it.</v>

91
00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.970
I'm probably going to spread the wealth and give my portions to everybody else

92
00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:05.650
or invite everybody to a nice meal.

93
00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.600
That's probably what I'm going to do with that money.
If I went,

94
00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:09.700
if I went $250 a day,

95
00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:13.570
I would donate it to my favorites nonprofit organization,

96
00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:17.320
which is the thirst project,
so I'm going to win it for them.

97
00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:20.980
<v 0>Oh,
rent $8 yeah.</v>

98
00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.870
This is very different with real money.

99
00:06:25.871 --> 00:06:29.470
This is like changing how partner and give you that.

100
00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:31.150
<v 2>Okay.</v>

101
00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:34.540
<v 0>The question is would you like to contribute to the price?
Paul?
If so,</v>

102
00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:37.600
please do it now.
So this will be going to one of you.

103
00:06:37.601 --> 00:06:42.020
If we want mines for charity,
what does like charity of your own pocket?

104
00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:46.570
If there's a project I'm willing to contribute but I don't have cash,

105
00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:53.410
I'll put up to another $750 I'm making $1,000 are you kidding?

106
00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.720
You're serious.
So whoever wins,

107
00:06:55.721 --> 00:07:00.420
you're just going to Venmo them $750 seriously on it.

108
00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:06.470
Third hand shake on it and make sure he's not.
No,

109
00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:08.760
I think it might be the liquid courage.
Shocking.

110
00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:09.913
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

111
00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:16.440
<v 0>Is capitalism good?
I don't think it's perfect,</v>

112
00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:20.160
but I don't think there is a perfect system.
You'll never please everybody.

113
00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:22.480
I do think,
um,

114
00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:27.090
because I've been in bread and like born into a capitalistic system,

115
00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:31.410
I'm programmed to think my worth and value is attributed to like how much I have

116
00:07:31.411 --> 00:07:33.600
or how much I can spend on this thing.

117
00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:37.230
And so I don't love that in your head.
Yeah,

118
00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:41.820
I don't think of it.
That's why it's so funny.
I think of it does,
uh,

119
00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:43.110
I create my destiny.

120
00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:46.920
There's no captain my ability that you want to attain that and that you can

121
00:07:46.921 --> 00:07:48.360
attain that Dow.
Sorry.

122
00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:52.600
I feel like you create your own destiny and where until you don't though.

123
00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:55.650
That's true.
But then that's your choice,
don't you think?

124
00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:59.020
I think we don't always have a choice in a lot of ways.
So like we don't,

125
00:07:59.021 --> 00:08:01.640
we can't control where we're born or who were born too.
Um,

126
00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.740
and so I think the whole bootstrap pulling yourself up from your bootstraps.

127
00:08:04.741 --> 00:08:07.290
Some people don't have a boot to pull their shops up with.

128
00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:10.650
Do you think some people lack motivation to change their circumstances?

129
00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:14.100
So you use the analogy of you were a teen mom and and like you worked and you

130
00:08:14.101 --> 00:08:17.460
fought,
you did all these things.
I know other teen moms who also,

131
00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:19.780
I know personally their support,
their effort.
Yeah.

132
00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:22.260
So I think they had support from their families and then I was kicked out.

133
00:08:22.261 --> 00:08:22.591
So yeah.

134
00:08:22.591 --> 00:08:27.591
So they had support from the friends and still still didn't make it though.

135
00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:31.830
Did like are struggling right now.
So people gave up?
No,
no.

136
00:08:31.831 --> 00:08:33.780
There's still some saying there's still fighting,

137
00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:38.460
but there are circumstances aren't changing and that's not anything that they're

138
00:08:38.461 --> 00:08:43.120
doing.
You've got to stop.
I have to stop.
If you keep doing the same thing.

139
00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:44.400
So if you were

140
00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:50.580
four children and you get help from your family,
but you still aren't,

141
00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:53.670
you're circumstances aren't changing.
You're telling me that that's their fault.

142
00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:55.050
100% okay.

143
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:59.170
<v 3>200 oh you're so lucky.
Community chest.</v>

145
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:08.240

I'm going to get this,
roll the dice.</v>

146
00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:13.130
The highest roller may dare the others to do anything to get out of a dare.

147
00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:17.110
Pay $125 to the bank.
I see you.

148
00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:20.470
All right,
so the dairies,

149
00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:24.770
so I dare you to tell everyone your how much you make.

150
00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:29.060
<v 3>It's millions of millions of dollars.
Hey,
exactly the exact number,</v>

151
00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:31.610
but the honest truth is I don't even know really.

152
00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:34.940
I don't know exactly how a Jamaica,
I know it's millions of dollars.
Okay?

153
00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:39.090
<v 0>I dare you to throw all of your money up in the air.</v>

154
00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:43.110
<v 3>How much is it?
Declare it.
89 bucks.</v>

155
00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:47.350
<v 1>Okay.
Yeah,
that was beautiful.</v>

156
00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:50.270
<v 3>That makes sure you kick it off and that you don't lose any money.
Yeah,</v>

157
00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:55.290
no ship you over $400 or $450 for 50 alright,

158
00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:02.170
here we go.
So I'm going to have to pay you the rest.

159
00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:06.460
He was supposed to mortgage your house or a property.
That's how you lose.
Okay.

160
00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:09.190
This is the beginning of your downfall.
It looks like it is.

161
00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:13.120
I'm going to mortgage waterworks.
How much is that?
75

162
00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:20.890
what's something money can't buy that.
Great.

163
00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:24.780
Even though I said that earlier,
you can buy health money,
can't buy you love it,

164
00:10:24.781 --> 00:10:28.610
can't buy you happiness,
which we've all there.

165
00:10:28.611 --> 00:10:31.930
You said so any of these things can be yeah,

166
00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:38.390
<v 1>no whammies
no,</v>

167
00:10:38.391 --> 00:10:42.540
I knew there and that's what happens when the university is like boom,

168
00:10:42.541 --> 00:10:45.910
I'll give it to you.
There's a book,
Law of attraction secret.

169
00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:47.063
You can't even put it out.

170
00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:54.120
<v 3>And then the kid is the 600 buck one.
Okay.
And his defense though.</v>

171
00:10:54.121 --> 00:10:57.300
I did like say that multiple times in my mind and I still haven't gotten pretty

172
00:10:57.370 --> 00:10:58.740
Clark.
Really believe it.
I did

173
00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:04.510
six six.
Are you kidding me?

174
00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:08.870
<v 1>Oh you got it.
Good job.
Truly believed that I asked you.</v>

175
00:11:08.871 --> 00:11:10.700
Did you truly believe it?
I did.

176
00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:15.590
Boom baby I fucking told you is true.

177
00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:29.410
<v 0>How did your parents or guardians influence how you think about money or
success?</v>

178
00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:32.840
<v 7>Because they kicked me out.
I had to make it happen.</v>

179
00:11:32.841 --> 00:11:36.620
And I think when you're put in a situation again with the fight or flight,

180
00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:39.830
I would hope most people would fight.
Um,
and that's what I did.

181
00:11:39.831 --> 00:11:43.160
And I think that's what made me the person I am today.
Had they given me every,

182
00:11:43.161 --> 00:11:46.790
all the resources I needed to be.
Okay.
I don't know that I would be this person.

183
00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:47.683
I don't know.

184
00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:50.130
<v 3>What do you mean you definitely would not be this person.
I'm telling you this,</v>

185
00:11:50.131 --> 00:11:54.400
you'd be maybe,
I don't know.
I feel very,
very,
very

186
00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:54.971
<v 4>driven.</v>

187
00:11:54.971 --> 00:11:59.971
And you're also the tenacity that you have originally in your personality.

188
00:12:00.551 --> 00:12:02.380
I can tell you are tenacious person,

189
00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:06.190
but I think 100% without even knowing you for too long,

190
00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:10.900
you are who you are because you suffered and you did what you did to get to this

191
00:12:10.901 --> 00:12:15.370
point.
You're absolutely fine.
Can I just say one thing,
which is like,
you know,

192
00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.290
all three of you.
I feel like it,
you know,

193
00:12:17.291 --> 00:12:21.820
I'd be like clearly struggled a lot more than I have in like that's something

194
00:12:21.821 --> 00:12:22.750
that I can't relate to.

195
00:12:22.751 --> 00:12:27.640
And usually I used to feel bad just because like that's how it can make you

196
00:12:27.641 --> 00:12:30.460
feel.
And I think now in the last couple of years,

197
00:12:30.461 --> 00:12:32.170
I've come to the realization that,
you know,

198
00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:37.210
just because you may have not had those type of struggles,
like financially,

199
00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:41.080
um,
you shouldn't feel bad.
You should not,
you know,

200
00:12:41.081 --> 00:12:43.810
you have those like moments where you like reappeared and eyes.

201
00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:45.250
I don't even know if that's a word,

202
00:12:45.251 --> 00:12:49.180
but like that's like I've had like a reappear.
Funny on that.

203
00:12:49.181 --> 00:12:53.660
Even though I've realized a while ago that I shouldn't feel bad.
Oh yeah.
So good.

204
00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:55.603
Okay.

205
00:12:59.110 --> 00:12:59.943
<v 3>Okay.</v>

206
00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:06.750
Four 39 cause some number that for me,

207
00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:11.850
$918 in cash.
Wait,
wait.

208
00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:16.920
Even with all your property,
you haven't counted the property.
1000,
145.

209
00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:21.730
How would you guys,
uh,
five oh nine.
Good job.
Good game.

210
00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:23.183
That was fun.

211
00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:27.640
<v 4>Low One.
I have a better idea why you guys choose,</v>

212
00:13:27.641 --> 00:13:30.940
because I was going to give all the money between all of you.
Oh.

213
00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:33.250
Or You could just give all the money to her for a charity.

214
00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:36.280
Take the to 50th start there.
Then I'll add to the pot.

215
00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:48.530
<v 3>$50 maybe $250 a charity.</v>

216
00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:53.230
Got to add the other Ryko was generous.
Oh yeah.

217
00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:57.760
He's been wearing it right now.
Your dollars can equal $1,000 going,

218
00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:03.590
Yay.
We just gave 40 people clean drinking water for life.

219
00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:09.140
We just gave a 40 keep all clean drinking water for life,
for life.

220
00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:10.170
Wow.
