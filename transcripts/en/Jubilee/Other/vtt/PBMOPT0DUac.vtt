00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.990
One of the most joyous moments in our relationship was when we heard that we won

2
00:00:03.991 --> 00:00:06.630
the lawsuit and then you got down on one knee and proposed to me,

3
00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:08.163
<v 1>okay,</v>

4
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:26.040
<v 0>we have a very exciting relationship.</v>

5
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.480
<v 2>Our relationship is enduring and very,</v>

6
00:00:33.301 --> 00:00:34.440
very true love.

7
00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:35.660
<v 1>I would agree with that.</v>

8
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.820
<v 0>I like to say the first impression I had of Chrissy was that it was like,</v>

9
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.710
it was like lust at first sight.

10
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.810
She was so beautiful and I was actually trying to introduce her to someone else.

11
00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.690
Um,
but I just,

12
00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.960
I got swept off of my feet by her beauty.
I mean,

13
00:00:55.961 --> 00:00:59.050
she's just one of the most beautiful people I've ever seen and I can't believe I

14
00:00:59.051 --> 00:00:59.884
married her.

15
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:03.990
<v 2>She was everything that I had been dreaming of.</v>

16
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.010
Literally that week I had been dreaming of going and meeting the woman of my

17
00:01:10.951 --> 00:01:15.150
dreams.
I wanted to meet an artist.
I wanted her to have long,

18
00:01:15.151 --> 00:01:19.710
brown hair.
I saw her and I was like,
oh my God,
she's,
she's right here.

19
00:01:19.711 --> 00:01:20.544
She's in front of me.

20
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.650
<v 0>I said,
it was lust at first sight.
And I said,
you were just like so beautiful.</v>

21
00:01:27.651 --> 00:01:28.670
And I can't believe I married you

22
00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.740
<v 2>when I first saw you.
It was literally like saying a dream come true.</v>

23
00:01:33.741 --> 00:01:38.030
I trimmed to view that week and even down to your hair.

24
00:01:38.031 --> 00:01:42.170
And I walked out and there you were and you were like a vision and I was like,

25
00:01:42.171 --> 00:01:45.140
oh my gosh,
there's the,
the rest of my life standing right in front of me.

26
00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.390
<v 0>That was so much more romantic than when I said you'll catch up.
Yeah.
Wow.</v>

27
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.760
Huh.
Um,
oh,

28
00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:01.150
our first real date was I picked her up and we went to a little restaurant and

29
00:02:01.461 --> 00:02:04.070
she was like so skinny and like I had no idea like what,

30
00:02:04.071 --> 00:02:06.830
how much this girl can eat.
And we went to a restaurant and she was like,

31
00:02:06.831 --> 00:02:10.040
what are these like massive pile of fries and just like ate the whole thing

32
00:02:10.041 --> 00:02:11.090
within like five minutes.

33
00:02:11.091 --> 00:02:15.290
And then we went to go see a musical called spring awakening.

34
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.110
And I was crazy about her.

35
00:02:18.111 --> 00:02:21.110
And at the end of the date I called my mom and was like,

36
00:02:21.111 --> 00:02:24.080
I'm crazy about this girl.
She was like,
come on over.
I want to meet her.

37
00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.160
<v 2>Our first date was,</v>

38
00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.460
I believe it was October 3rd,

39
00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.110
2011 she took me to see one of your all time favorite Broadway shows.

40
00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.430
Spring awakening.
I already knew at that point that I was like,

41
00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.380
I want to spend the rest of my life with this girl.

42
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.360
And I know I get carried away and like I fall so fast,
but I really did know.

43
00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:52.000
And then he met her mom that night.
So I guess she knew to spring awakening.

44
00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.153
What date?

45
00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.060
<v 1>The date?
Yeah,</v>

46
00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.980
in spring he took me for my

47
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:00.960
<v 2>birthday.
Oh,</v>

48
00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.270
Tobar fifth it was October 3rd it's not your birthday.

49
00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.610
So that's a trick question.

50
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.550
So did you say about the going to the restaurant first?
No,

51
00:03:09.551 --> 00:03:12.490
I just said I already knew I wanted to spend my life with you and I didn't know

52
00:03:12.491 --> 00:03:14.500
how you felt,
but then you took me to meet your mom.

53
00:03:14.501 --> 00:03:15.820
So I guess you were thinking that too.

54
00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.390
I said that they said they took you to meet.
My mom has tree left.

55
00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:20.573
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

56
00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:30.100
<v 0>Having a relationship scrutinized by the hundreds of thousands of people is</v>

57
00:03:31.101 --> 00:03:35.570
really intense.
And I think that if we didn't really love each other,

58
00:03:35.571 --> 00:03:40.571
we would have not made it through having a youtube channel ditch the truth.

59
00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.230
We started daily vlogging and it nearly broke up our relationship because we

60
00:03:45.231 --> 00:03:48.800
started realizing we weren't really interacting with each other,

61
00:03:48.801 --> 00:03:50.600
but really interacting for a camera.

62
00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.650
Most any couple who is a blogger who's been doing it for any substantial amount

63
00:03:54.651 --> 00:03:57.890
of time would say that it's really damaging to their relationship.

64
00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.850
<v 2>You know,
Gosh,</v>

65
00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.200
I think having our channel in the limelight,

66
00:04:04.201 --> 00:04:08.220
having a relationship in the limelight has affected us in a negative way.

67
00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.390
I think that not having any,
any independence for a years,
you know,

68
00:04:12.391 --> 00:04:17.200
our channel is Bria and Christie or email is Bria and Chrissy.
Um,

69
00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:22.310
we kind of lost ourselves and just became one unit and I think that over the

70
00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.440
last year we've been finally finding ourselves again.

71
00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.900
I said that having the channel adds a significant amount of pressure.

72
00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.990
That's all you said.
Oh,
I'm sorry.

73
00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.030
It's like when we went on that tour boat,
no life jacket.

74
00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.690
I said that having the channel adds an immense amount of pressure,

75
00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.870
but also having the channel,
um,

76
00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:54.290
allowed fans to remind us in those hardest times that they saw our true lab and

77
00:04:54.631 --> 00:04:58.890
it was able to draw us back to like know what we have is really true love.

78
00:04:58.891 --> 00:05:02.550
But I think that the channel and the blogging is incredibly destructive

79
00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.400
<v 0>and that's really the reason we were able to like sustain having a youtube</v>

80
00:05:06.401 --> 00:05:10.760
channel is because are we our relationships so genuine,
otherwise we would never,

81
00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.600
never have made it.
And the positives was that we,
you know,

82
00:05:13.601 --> 00:05:16.570
have all these wonderful memories that we get to look back on for the rest of

83
00:05:16.571 --> 00:05:17.404
our lives.

84
00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.300
I'm going to go along the lines of the Youtube,

85
00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.550
the worst mistake that I ever made.

86
00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:31.430
What's Chrissy did a bunch of pranks on me and it was like 10 and they were like

87
00:05:32.101 --> 00:05:35.970
really annoying praying because like I can't have caffeine.

88
00:05:35.971 --> 00:05:40.110
And she went to get my decaf coffee but it wasn't decaf and she gave it to me at

89
00:05:40.111 --> 00:05:44.070
like seven.
Oh,
he's the worst night's sleep of my life.
Like she,

90
00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:48.840
she just like pulled a bunch of really annoying pranks on me.
So I decided,

91
00:05:48.841 --> 00:05:53.070
I was like,
oh,
I'll just get her back.
I'll just one upper,
oh God,

92
00:05:53.071 --> 00:05:54.480
I should never have done this.

93
00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.180
<v 1>Hmm.
Okay.</v>

94
00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:05.220
<v 0>So I broke up with her on camera.
I,</v>

95
00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:10.000
I don't know what the hell I was thinking anyways,
the worst,

96
00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:14.200
worst,
worst idea to ever do something like that to someone you love.

97
00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:18.010
And uh,
I was like,
oh my God,
I can't post this.

98
00:06:18.011 --> 00:06:20.500
Because like she was crying and it was so sad.
She was like,

99
00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:23.470
if I went through this,
you're going to post it on the Internet.

100
00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:27.370
It's so easy.
You don't need to be smiling baby.

101
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:30.740
<v 2>I would say that the,</v>

102
00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:36.490
the biggest mistakes that I've made in our relationship is

103
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:40.063
drinking.

104
00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:45.910
I battled PTSD for nine years and during the case and the lawsuit and the

105
00:06:47.331 --> 00:06:50.870
revenge porn,
like I just got into such a sad,

106
00:06:50.871 --> 00:06:53.240
dark place in my mind and wanting to escape it.

107
00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:58.810
There's two times that I drank and both times Bria thought that I was going to

108
00:06:59.511 --> 00:07:03.140
die.
The doctor said,
I might die.
And um,

109
00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:08.560
one was in 2013 and I was lucky to survive and I promised to never drink again.

110
00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:12.260
And um,

111
00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:17.500
and then the other was last Saturday when I relapsed and I drank again and I

112
00:07:19.011 --> 00:07:23.060
almost died.
I put her through that twice and I hate,

113
00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:28.520
I hate that.
And now I'm finally getting real true help for this disease.

114
00:07:28.521 --> 00:07:29.810
But also I never,

115
00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:34.100
I never want to die and I never want the person who loves me more than anyone

116
00:07:34.101 --> 00:07:37.430
has ever loved me to have to go through that pain again.

117
00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:42.020
I want to love myself,
which I clearly have struggled with.

118
00:07:42.021 --> 00:07:45.650
I want to love myself in the same true way that Bree loves me.

119
00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.670
I said the two worst mistakes that I made her,
my,

120
00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:54.050
it's my drinking 2013 and then last Saturday,

121
00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:59.300
what did he say?
I signed it.
Putting you,

122
00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:03.470
putting you through twice now.
Um,
the fear of,

123
00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:06.180
of death,
the fear of Homos,

124
00:08:06.181 --> 00:08:11.181
Lucy may because of my torment and my mental anguish putting you through that

125
00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:17.270
is,
is the two worst mistakes that I've made.
What did you say?

126
00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:24.590
<v 0>Um,
I said about the,
the youtube prank where I broke up with you.</v>

127
00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:29.710
<v 2>Oh.
Oh,
all our shit's out there.
And</v>

128
00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:33.620
that's okay.
I don't mind being honest.
Yeah.

129
00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:39.210
<v 0>I told her
when she survived last week,</v>

130
00:08:39.211 --> 00:08:43.860
I told her that I made vows to her in sickness and in health and she's sick.

131
00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:47.493
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

132
00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:01.030
<v 2>I've never been loved the way that Brianna loves me and I've never loved anyone</v>

133
00:09:01.031 --> 00:09:05.620
or anything in the way that I love Bria and I feel like that love can get us

134
00:09:05.621 --> 00:09:08.860
through literally anything and it feels like we've been through everything.

135
00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:14.933
<v 1>Okay.</v>

136
00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:25.400
<v 0>I would say one of the most incredible moments in our relationship was about a</v>

137
00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.060
year into our relationship.

138
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:32.300
We realized that we were going to have to enter a lawsuit and I'm Krissy became

139
00:09:32.851 --> 00:09:37.851
the first ever person to pursue a lawsuit of this nature.

140
00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:41.850
And four years,

141
00:09:41.851 --> 00:09:46.620
four and a half years of fighting this lawsuit tie tirelessly.

142
00:09:46.621 --> 00:09:50.910
Like,
Eh,
I mean it's just took up our lives.
Um,

143
00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:55.940
we were in England and it got announced that we won the lawsuit.

144
00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:01.940
And I'm getting to hear that moment and feel that moment with the person that

145
00:10:03.721 --> 00:10:08.721
you love who had been fighting so hard for this accomplishment was just like

146
00:10:09.391 --> 00:10:11.070
nothing I've ever experienced in my life.

147
00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:15.780
And right after that moment she got down on one knee and proposed to me,

148
00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:18.630
<v 1>okay.</v>

149
00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:23.630
<v 2>I would say a defining moment and our relationship was probably the like the day</v>

150
00:10:27.931 --> 00:10:31.610
that I found out I was a victim of revenge porn.
Um,

151
00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:37.880
it was like our world came crashing down and we were crushed that whole week.

152
00:10:39.901 --> 00:10:40.734
That defining,

153
00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:46.040
defining moment was starting in case for me and I became like incapable of

154
00:10:48.331 --> 00:10:52.080
functioning.
Like I was just so distraught.

155
00:10:52.081 --> 00:10:57.081
My life had completely just shattered and Bria loved me so much.

156
00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:02.400
She knew the terror that we were both feeling and she stayed strong,

157
00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:07.940
stayed my rock and found us uninterrupted and like gave me the courage to pursue

158
00:11:09.421 --> 00:11:13.620
this lawsuit.
Kept loving me through all the night terrors,

159
00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:15.990
all of the pain,
all of the drinking,

160
00:11:15.991 --> 00:11:20.991
all of the just anguish of PTSD and she stayed with me.

161
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.720
She gave me the strength to keep fighting when I didn't think that I could keep

162
00:11:27.721 --> 00:11:29.550
fighting.
I didn't know if I could survive.

163
00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:36.550
I think you knew that my answer would be like the moment that we found out about

164
00:11:36.551 --> 00:11:38.830
the revenge porn.
Um,

165
00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:43.720
that whole thing of you being there for me when I was completely crushed,

166
00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:49.080
you know what my answer was?
Winning the lawsuit.
Uh,

167
00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:54.750
that's so interesting because I think winning the was a defining moment for us,

168
00:11:54.941 --> 00:11:56.800
but that was like the victorious part.

169
00:11:57.190 --> 00:12:02.080
I think that the part of finding out and then you choosing to stay for five

170
00:12:02.081 --> 00:12:05.080
years,
it's like that was the defining moment for me.

171
00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:09.200
One of the most joyous moments in our relationship was when we hear that we won

172
00:12:09.201 --> 00:12:11.870
the lawsuit and then you got down on one knee and proposed to me,

173
00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:18.850
how could I not after you stuck by me for all those years.

174
00:12:18.851 --> 00:12:22.330
That's like the only thing I could think of to celebrate.

175
00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:23.860
So we did kind of say the same thing,

176
00:12:23.861 --> 00:12:27.880
just different ends at the beginning and the end.
Yeah.

177
00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:33.660
There's pretty much not a reason why I don't love her.

178
00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:36.810
Our hearts just love each other

179
00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:46.020
and I would do anything for you.

180
00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:47.473
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

181
00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:54.660
<v 2>I just,
I,
I,
I don't even know how to explain it.
I just can't help myself.</v>

182
00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:58.500
I can't help but love her.
It's like,

183
00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:04.530
I don't know.
It's like our hearts were just destined to know each other.

184
00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:08.580
It's like breathe.
It feels like home to me.
I can't help but love her.

185
00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:11.260
<v 1>Okay.</v>

186
00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.290
<v 2>I said our hearts just</v>

187
00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:19.230
<v 1>love each other
and,
um,
I would do anything for you.</v>

188
00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:22.393
<v 2>I said,</v>

189
00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:27.400
I can't help but love you because it's like our hearts just know each other and,

190
00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:32.870
um,
I just,
I can't help but love you.
Your heart feels like home to me.

191
00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:33.763
You feel like home.

192
00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:42.420
We want a good thumbnail.
I just want to kiss.
I know.

193
00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:46.400
<v 1>Gimme a kiss.
Don't do that.</v>
