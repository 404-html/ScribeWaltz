1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.310
There are so many people that are better cooks than I am.

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.630
I think my strength is being able to be personable with people and like make

3
00:00:07.631 --> 00:00:12.390
sure that they like feel really nourished and happy.
Big Old,

4
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.900
beautiful trees that were here before me.
There'll be who after me.

5
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:17.810
The farm always keeps me humble.

6
00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.600
These are stamen winds up apple trees.
I've got about 70 trees here.

7
00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.850
I do the pruning by myself.
It takes me about five to eight hours per tree.

8
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.340
On an average day.
When I'm cooking for a client,

9
00:00:43.341 --> 00:00:45.230
I'll usually start at the farmer's market.

10
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.700
I try to find the most unusual produce and I make something I've never made

11
00:00:49.701 --> 00:00:52.880
before with it.
So that's also on the list for today.

12
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.370
This is where everybody is funnels through here.
When they're done with her,

13
00:00:56.371 --> 00:00:59.700
you pick with my meatballs,
whatever sauce I put on,

14
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.530
I also sell about sauce.

15
00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:05.043
<v 2>Okay.</v>

16
00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.840
<v 0>Hi,
what is this?
This is the old boy.
Tiny squat.
Oh,
okay.</v>

17
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.500
Thank you.
Oh,
interesting.

18
00:01:15.501 --> 00:01:19.820
It is Tempura and sometimes I don't necessarily have all those ingredients at

19
00:01:19.821 --> 00:01:21.050
home,
but we could get them.

20
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.500
I did some searching online for some recipes that looked legit.

21
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.630
So we're just going to grab a few items.

22
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.350
Oh yeah.
There's already a line out there.
As soon as we open up the gate,
um,

23
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.240
if you guys can help me get the signs out there.
It feels so weirdly prepared.

24
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.410
<v 3>Good morning everybody.
How are we ready to pick some apples today?</v>

25
00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.660
<v 2>Okay.</v>

26
00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.190
<v 3>If you're wanting to pick apples,</v>

27
00:01:58.191 --> 00:02:02.870
we're harvesting our stamen wine PSAP apples today.
Woo.

28
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:04.533
<v 2>It is hot.</v>

29
00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.040
<v 3>Where are you visiting from?
Downy.
Okay.
Not too far.</v>

30
00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.320
<v 0>Damn.
This mint smells so good.</v>

31
00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.020
This is a combination of ingredients for salads,
for a client,

32
00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.330
lunches to take to work and then also ingredients for my nausea.

33
00:02:24.331 --> 00:02:29.170
With Tosh Instagram,
I actually started cooking pretty late in life.

34
00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.810
I want it to be an actor like everybody else in their mother.

35
00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.070
I didn't like the food at school.
I was like,

36
00:02:36.071 --> 00:02:40.900
I kind of want to find a way to merge performing and food.
Dude,

37
00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.540
I'm 58 I was in my early thirties we were just driving by and I just fell in

38
00:02:47.511 --> 00:02:52.040
love with the land itself.
We moved here and then um,
you know,

39
00:02:52.041 --> 00:02:57.020
I'm making $3,000 for a whole year's labor.
So that's when we decided,

40
00:02:57.021 --> 00:02:59.590
well,
we were going to try and do you pick on farm?

41
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.180
I got a job at assisting teaching cooking classes and then it just sort of like

42
00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.410
snowballing private chef work and doing notch Latasha.

43
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.370
And for the most part I've been really lucky.

44
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.000
I'm obsessed with the salad spinner in the video that I just put out where I

45
00:03:16.001 --> 00:03:19.380
made a Frittata,
it was a video sponsored by Oxo.
Um,

46
00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.800
I'm wearing a suit and a shirt,
a lost of the meatballs.

47
00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.100
Today we're going to cook 40 pounds of meat balls.

48
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.960
I started out just going to trader Joe's,
getting the little meatballs there,

49
00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.100
and then it got to where I would come in and wipe out the whole refrigerator

50
00:03:36.101 --> 00:03:38.460
supply area.
And Vince,

51
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.530
when I realized like I've grown past the trader Joe's thing,

52
00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.660
these are frozen solid.

53
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.760
There are definitely certain laws about the amount that you can cook at home for

54
00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.670
Heb legal.
Until recently it was like $60,000.

55
00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.850
If I had all the money in the world.
This is where I live.

56
00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.960
I love this like Cradley area between the Palisades in Santa Monica.

57
00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.440
Okay,
so fine.
45 which totals gonna be 1130 please.

58
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.250
How the 20 I get you a little bag there for your goodies.
Thank you very much.

59
00:04:15.251 --> 00:04:18.940
You guys have a great day for little tiny farms like me.

60
00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.970
You have to diversify because I can work my best and a hail storm can come and

61
00:04:24.761 --> 00:04:28.360
wipe out my crop in one day.
We've shot movies here.

62
00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.740
We've had print ads.
I'd done some weddings,
so took some heat for that,

63
00:04:32.741 --> 00:04:36.550
so I stopped doing that.
Right?

64
00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.900
My neighbor complained and that's how the first,
you know,

65
00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.930
county permitting issues came about when code enforcement came out.

66
00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:51.010
They're like,
I can't believe somebody complaining about this.
Beautiful Barb.

67
00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.820
But if you're a powerful person up here,

68
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.290
what you complain about will be taken care of.
Sure.

69
00:04:59.291 --> 00:05:03.790
When do you need it?
When I do recipe testing for branded content,

70
00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.820
it's a little bit like ghost writing,
if you will.

71
00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.410
What I'm working on right now is a spicy fried chicken that you can tuck inside

72
00:05:11.411 --> 00:05:12.820
of a bubble waffle.

73
00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.140
The first thing I do is make them a bunch of times and then I'll just send them

74
00:05:17.141 --> 00:05:18.280
guideline photos,

75
00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:23.310
so this will take me about three hours and I bill for this type of work at $100

76
00:05:23.441 --> 00:05:24.130
an hour.

77
00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:29.130
Yesterday we grossed about 3,800 when we're busy,

78
00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:31.420
they're more like $8,000 days.

79
00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.750
You might think that $8,000 sounds like a lot for a day,

80
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.110
but there's going to be months when there's no income,

81
00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:40.360
but the work still continues here.

82
00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.950
The next notch photosh episode that I have coming out is Thai pumpkin soup.

83
00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:46.090
So this already,

84
00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:51.150
this first piece has to go because it's just too long when like someone else is

85
00:05:51.971 --> 00:05:53.230
paying you to do the recipe,

86
00:05:53.231 --> 00:05:57.950
you have to follow very specific guidelines and it has to be like really

87
00:05:57.951 --> 00:05:58.940
professional.
Yeah,

88
00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:03.070
and this just feels so like this is just me hanging out

89
00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:06.850
<v 3>who's ready to pick some apples.
Anyway,</v>

90
00:06:06.851 --> 00:06:10.330
before I send you on your way,
I'm going to give you a couple of tips.

91
00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.660
When you're picking one apple,
you might have a few more come down.
Okay.

92
00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:16.590
<v 0>Okay.
I've never been motivated by money,</v>

93
00:06:16.591 --> 00:06:20.400
which makes me a terrible business woman.
When I do preschool tourism,

94
00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:23.070
I top out at 48 kids.

95
00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:27.870
My neighbors might bring in six different schools at one time.
When buses there,

96
00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:32.730
there's one predominant family and they have almost a total monopoly.

97
00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:34.830
They probably make more money than me.

98
00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:39.360
I would imagine that they're not picking up apples every morning like I am.
Yes.

99
00:06:39.361 --> 00:06:41.760
Could I make a lot of money really fast?

100
00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:46.410
I think that's what some of my competition does and I've just always take him to

101
00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.030
the exact opposite approach.

102
00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.540
<v 3>Looking pretty good on that tractor.
Alright.</v>

103
00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:53.840
Hey,

104
00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:58.460
<v 0>don't know how to know how old and Opo is.
Oh,</v>

105
00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.370
cool.
Wow.

106
00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:06.080
It really does look like a cross between a squash and a cucumber with the seeds

107
00:07:06.081 --> 00:07:06.914
in the center,

108
00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:11.210
it has a little bit of a like a Slimy Mountain Yam texture.

109
00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:12.393
<v 2>My favorite thing.</v>

110
00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:21.400
Now we're at a perfect deep fry.

111
00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:25.440
These look like a stupid American native more or

112
00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:44.400
<v 0>Oh Whoa,
we sold a lot of the other one.</v>

113
00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:45.373
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

114
00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:53.750
<v 0>pretty much every day I'm open.
I have people come in kind of stricken.</v>

115
00:07:53.751 --> 00:07:56.420
You know why Sarah for sale side?

116
00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:59.030
I had intended to do it longer,

117
00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:03.050
but I'm also one that believes that you got to listen to what the universe is

118
00:08:03.051 --> 00:08:06.470
telling you.
I wonder if I'll ever feel comfortable with where I'm at.

119
00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:12.470
I hear like that sort of like,
I know a lot of people who are way,

120
00:08:12.471 --> 00:08:16.310
way,
way more successful than me that I think also have this same like internal

121
00:08:16.311 --> 00:08:18.770
desire to continue like growing and doing better.

122
00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:23.870
I can comfortably afford my life and do it in a flexible way,

123
00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:26.570
but do I feel like I'm where I want to be?
No.

124
00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:29.900
When my neighbors are complaining to the county,

125
00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:33.230
when the county is giving me cease and desist orders,

126
00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:37.670
it takes the joy away.
The problem with doing what you love,

127
00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:41.510
she puts her heart and soul into it,
you know?
So,

128
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:45.380
which is what people love about it.
But you know,

129
00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:49.400
it makes it hard when you,
what do you might need to leave?

130
00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:58.710
My kids are like,
mom worked so hard.
Get out and go do something else.

131
00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:00.240
Maybe it's just time.

132
00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:09.330
I tried to make a lot of time for friends and to like be a good neighbor and

133
00:09:09.331 --> 00:09:11.730
like brighten people's days in small ways.
I Dunno.

134
00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:16.350
I Dunno how much your happiness should be connected to your success.
I give,

135
00:09:16.351 --> 00:09:21.220
that's just an unwinnable I trick.
I don't know.
But

136
00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:25.870
if that was all that I connected my happiness to like,

137
00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:27.030
then I wouldn't be happening.

138
00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:33.060
Mother Nature is pretty amazing.
You know,

139
00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:35.790
when you stand next to a tree like this,

140
00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:41.080
I'm going to imagine all the history that's occurred in a hundred years that's

141
00:09:42.481 --> 00:09:47.400
still here and it's still standing and it's still producing beautiful apples.
