WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:02.083
We're at a cabin

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.910
<v 1>in Korea town ran.
What are we even talking about right now?</v>

3
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.880
We've been talking about the frustration of viral video,

4
00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.470
viral and valuable and this overlap right here.
How do you get,

5
00:00:12.471 --> 00:00:15.380
how do you get like we're trying to find that.
Trying to get weird spot.

6
00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.370
Our content is like,
it could be so much more valuable to you guys.

7
00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.470
Watch
videos.

8
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.770
Stop wanting our crap.
You guys.
You know what I mean?

9
00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:30.450
Crazy.

10
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.760
<v 0>No.
You know,
making a living from filmmaking,</v>

11
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.300
you have to understand the insane struggle of balancing business and art.

12
00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.520
<v 2>Well,
yeah,
see that's the thing is we're trying to,</v>

13
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.570
<v 0>how do you create something meaningful that hits the numbers,</v>

14
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.830
brings in money and is artful.
The laws.

15
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.400
Some ideas are more about the numbers,
others more about the art,
the capacity,

16
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.700
but half a year ago we thought of an idea together that felt like it was the

17
00:00:53.701 --> 00:00:54.690
perfect balance.

18
00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.310
<v 1>We're going to bring them in.
Don't bring him to come in like single file,</v>

19
00:01:00.311 --> 00:01:01.650
but there won't be like concern.

20
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.190
<v 0>The idea was,</v>

21
00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:07.880
what if you got people with completely opposite belief systems together in a

22
00:01:07.881 --> 00:01:10.450
single room to share an authentic,
meaningful space?

23
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.460
<v 3>You're not a,
you're not a concern.
You're not a liberal.</v>

24
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.610
<v 0>We would name this series,
middle ground.</v>

25
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.310
The idea was entertaining but meaningful,
marketable,
but artful,

26
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.140
mainstream,
but challenging.
We thought we had a winner on our hands.

27
00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.880
<v 3>I feel like it got better and better as we went on the last,</v>

28
00:01:31.881 --> 00:01:33.670
the last one was just like crazy

29
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.050
<v 0>until we got to the editing stage.</v>

30
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.270
<v 2>Taylor.
Ian,
what have you been going through?
Well,</v>

31
00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.090
you see there's this edit that has proven,
yeah,

32
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.480
difficult.
Um,
because it could go a bazillion different ways.

33
00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.120
Actually,
I should look at this red thing.

34
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.450
<v 0>It's not all fun and games.
What we do every day,</v>

35
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.320
there's a different level of commitment that comes into play when building a

36
00:02:10.321 --> 00:02:13.810
company with everybody pulling their weight that inspires,

37
00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.310
but nobody has more pressure than Jason,
our founder and CEO,

38
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.730
who's responsible for the cash flow to make this whole thing work.

39
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.940
<v 4>All right,
Jason,
what are you doing right now?
What about the call at an investor?</v>

40
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.780
Ooh,
maybe investing in jubilee.

41
00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.240
We're trying to raise capital and we're trying to raise around $750,000 to grow

42
00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.460
jubilee,
which sounds like a lot and it is a lot.
Hi,

43
00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.110
is this Josh?
Hi Josh.
This is Jason from Juliette.

44
00:02:45.111 --> 00:02:45.944
How are you?

45
00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.240
<v 3>What we're trying to do?
It's expensive.
It takes time.</v>

46
00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.250
It takes money and honestly at first this idea of like raising capital and

47
00:02:55.091 --> 00:02:58.900
finding investors is really,
really scary and really difficult,

48
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.770
but I think over time I've realized that you know what?

49
00:03:02.771 --> 00:03:06.520
We're trying to do something really important.
Yeah,
but at the end of the day,

50
00:03:06.521 --> 00:03:10.090
we want to just tell stories that speak to human connection.

51
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.830
I believe that this is something that the world needs and wants right now,

52
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.880
especially now more than ever when the world is divided and people are

53
00:03:18.881 --> 00:03:19.780
discouraged,

54
00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.730
yet we're asking deep questions is about purpose and passion and how do I give

55
00:03:24.731 --> 00:03:28.750
back?
We want to be that media company that represents all of that.

56
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.000
This is Jason from jubilee.
We have huge vision and were first to get there.

57
00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.360
We need some incredible people to support us financially.

58
00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.970
We've got a potential investor.
His name is Perry,

59
00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.220
to talk about whether here in domestic jubilee,

60
00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.250
<v 0>90% of startups die in the first couple of years.</v>

61
00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.120
So to ask people to give us money while we're still a super young startup is a

62
00:03:50.121 --> 00:03:55.121
really ballsy and petrifying thing to do without anything to prove ourselves.

63
00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.000
How do you convince investors?
You'll be the next Google,
the next Disney,

64
00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.950
Netflix or Amazon,
and if nobody comes on board,
what happens?
Yeah,

65
00:04:03.951 --> 00:04:04.850
you can send them a place.

66
00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.240
We would all lose our jobs and there'd be no more jubilee.

67
00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.190
You look phenomenal.

68
00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.100
<v 1>All
right.</v>

69
00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.310
<v 4>Tell me a little bit more about jubilee.
So jubilee,</v>

70
00:04:29.311 --> 00:04:31.020
we are,

71
00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.160
we want to be the definitive media company for millennials that is positive and

72
00:04:35.161 --> 00:04:37.620
aspirational.
I feel like more now than ever,

73
00:04:37.621 --> 00:04:42.570
like the world is very divided and we need stories to bring us together at this

74
00:04:42.571 --> 00:04:45.390
point.
For me,
it's not a question of whether we'll see,
see it or not.

75
00:04:45.391 --> 00:04:48.540
It's a matter of do we want to be a $30 million company?

76
00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.580
We've got $300 million company or like a $3 billion company.
Okay.

77
00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.580
All right.
That's badly audacious.
I mostly,

78
00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.480
I guess when you're going through that kind of thought process,

79
00:05:00.481 --> 00:05:03.490
what makes you even say,
you know what,
I,

80
00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.940
I'm happy with being a smaller version,

81
00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:06.803
<v 1>not myself.</v>

82
00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.680
<v 4>You know?
That's a good question.
You know,
I don't,
I don't think I appreciate,</v>

83
00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:18.010
or like when I'm in the founders or investors or whoever will just blow smoke up

84
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.640
people's by it and just say like,
we're going to be that $7 billion company.

85
00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:22.361
That being said,

86
00:05:22.361 --> 00:05:27.040
I really believe that there's going to be a major player in this space.

87
00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:31.510
If we get the capital that we need and we get the advisors that we need,

88
00:05:31.511 --> 00:05:32.740
which is on me right now,

89
00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.990
we're going to be that size because someone will be that size and of that,

90
00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:37.990
why not us?

91
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.340
I also know how difficult it's going to be in or how much worked out well.
Yeah.

92
00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:44.270
Cool.
Cool.
I appreciate it.
Thanks.
Thanks.

93
00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:47.273
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

94
00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:00.900
<v 3>When did you,
that was very interesting to witness.
Was it?
This is,</v>

95
00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.850
how do you think,
how do you think you did this?

96
00:06:04.851 --> 00:06:06.530
I don't think actually it was my a game.

97
00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.010
I think I was like a little bit on how to be honest because I was like thinking

98
00:06:10.011 --> 00:06:11.930
in the back of my head,
like what should I be saying?

99
00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.390
Like how should I articulate that?
And then some people are like,

100
00:06:14.391 --> 00:06:17.930
I just don't get it.
And you really feel like,
oh crap.
Yeah.

101
00:06:17.931 --> 00:06:22.760
Like you're making nothing.
I have a whole list of investors and like,

102
00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:24.171
you know,

103
00:06:24.171 --> 00:06:28.310
the list is like almost 50 people now and that means like at least 30 or 40 of

104
00:06:28.311 --> 00:06:30.500
them have sat down and they kind of tangentially

105
00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:35.650
<v 0>anyway,
getting investors on board is one thing,</v>

106
00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:40.690
but obviously there are other hurdles too.
Like getting to edit,

107
00:06:40.691 --> 00:06:43.450
just to write for this new web series that we poured our hearts time,

108
00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:46.780
energy and a lot of money into that just wasn't working.

109
00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:52.150
<v 2>You're having a hard time like tying it together and creating that like full</v>

110
00:06:52.151 --> 00:06:55.270
arch,
right?
Yeah,
kind of.

111
00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:58.300
<v 1>I see.
Very confused.</v>

112
00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:04.010
<v 0>Of course things become even more complicated when everybody disagrees about how</v>

113
00:07:04.011 --> 00:07:04.844
to go forward.

114
00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:07.050
<v 2>Um,
so I feel like you're more,</v>

115
00:07:07.051 --> 00:07:10.270
he just had a lot more notes on this draft than he did on the previous drafts.

116
00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:15.540
And then at the end he said that he preferred the last draft and he would rather

117
00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:18.603
revert.

118
00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:22.150
<v 5>Yeah.
It just felt like it lost a spun navy of it.</v>

119
00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:27.610
Like I know we have the hook,
but I,
I feel like the hook isn't going to,

120
00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.770
<v 2>we gave Taylor probably the opposite feedback.</v>

121
00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:35.150
I'm trying to think.
So you were getting a lot of feedback,

122
00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:40.270
getting a lot of feedback and a lot of different views on like opposing views,

123
00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:44.660
opposing views,
middle sound film.
Yes.

124
00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:47.810
Just like the opposing views in this video.

125
00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:52.210
All Nice parallel were doing.
Oh,

126
00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:55.460
I don't even notice that.
Like doing that.
Oh,
I see.

127
00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:18.250
<v 1>Oh,
good morning.</v>

128
00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:20.463
<v 3>Another day.</v>

129
00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:25.160
<v 1>Oh my,</v>

130
00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:35.830
<v 3>I agree.
It was good.
It was good to let's go.</v>

131
00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:39.623
<v 1>Okay.</v>

132
00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:42.073
<v 3>Okay.</v>

133
00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:47.853
<v 1>Uh,</v>

134
00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:50.963
<v 3>hello.</v>

135
00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:56.010
Y'all pulled up some magic.

136
00:08:56.020 --> 00:09:00.120
<v 2>Yeah.
Still you gotta wash.
This is so much better cause there's so much better.</v>

137
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:04.050
Yeah.
It's like Lowe's better.
Oh,
holy crap.

138
00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:14.990
Nice.
Great.
Yeah,

139
00:09:14.991 --> 00:09:18.680
I think it definitely took a huge step forward.
Yeah,
right.
Yeah.

140
00:09:18.681 --> 00:09:21.560
Just to turn the way back,
way,
way better.

141
00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:27.200
<v 3>That's some good news guys.
Um,</v>

142
00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:31.790
I just found out that Steve Chen is the founder of youtube is going to invest in

143
00:09:31.791 --> 00:09:32.624
it

144
00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:41.970
<v 2>a
huge deal.</v>

145
00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:46.140
Yeah.
Rap.
Well,
so hopefully the money is,

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:37.680
people that you love and also get to do things and make content that people are

158
00:10:38.201 --> 00:10:42.410
really touched and inspired by.
It feels like a dream.

159
00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:47.930
