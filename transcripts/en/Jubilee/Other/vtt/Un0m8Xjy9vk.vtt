00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.930
How many people do you think will be less?
Uh,
I'll say too,

2
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:08.640
I guess I'll just throw a number out.
If it's zero then hey,

3
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.220
that's my life already.
So it's

4
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.630
instead of,
hello,
I just put help.

5
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:38.973
<v 2>Okay,</v>

6
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.920
<v 1>nice.
All right.
Okay.</v>

7
00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:46.773
Okay.

8
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.590
<v 2>Anyone who doesn't want to go on a blind date?
Leave the circle in three,
two.</v>

9
00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.963
<v 1>Hello?</v>

10
00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:00.303
<v 2>Oh,
hi.</v>

11
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.780
<v 0>I think I definitely prefer girls who have been in a relationship before or at</v>

12
00:01:06.781 --> 00:01:09.090
least maybe a long term relationship,
uh,

13
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.450
because they really kind of know what it's like to be in a relationship and

14
00:01:12.451 --> 00:01:15.540
starting something new with somebody who's never had that.
It was a lot harder,

15
00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:21.223
<v 1>honestly.</v>

16
00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:30.983
Fair.

17
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.290
Wow.
Okay.
A lot of them out.

18
00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.890
<v 3>Okay.</v>

19
00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:56.240
<v 2>Okay.</v>

20
00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.460
<v 0>Oh God.
That's okay.
We'll go for the click bait first.</v>

21
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.380
You know,
getting experimental in the bedroom is always fun for me.

22
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.790
That sounds like I'm Christian Gray by nothing too crazy.
I don't like,

23
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.950
like things getting boring.
I just like the position Robo Kingston.

24
00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:32.423
<v 1>Okay,</v>

25
00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:44.283
cool.

26
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.160
<v 0>Got that out of the way.</v>

27
00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.370
<v 3>Ethnicity wise,
I have zero preference.
Um,
I genuinely find it</v>

28
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.490
<v 0>any race culture.
But,
uh,</v>

29
00:02:58.491 --> 00:02:59.950
when it comes to like physical afternoons,

30
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.330
definitely prefer girls who are either a couple of inches taller than me or

31
00:03:04.331 --> 00:03:07.210
shorter.
I don't mind it when it goes a little bit taller than me,

32
00:03:07.211 --> 00:03:11.230
but if it's over like two inches maybe I feel a little bit weird.

33
00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:30.560
<v 4>Cool.
Cool.</v>

34
00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:36.660
<v 0>I don't like it when girls believe in horoscopes.
Um,</v>

35
00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.010
which is like the weirdest thing ever.
But I hate it when someone's like,
oh,

36
00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.220
I'm a Libra.
I don't think Meta Click,

37
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.370
the moon's aren't aligned for this and this month,
so we can't really,
you know,

38
00:03:47.371 --> 00:03:50.700
get Boba because we wouldn't click.
I hate that shit.

39
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.690
God's good.
Okay.

40
00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:22.000
I liked girls who are into the arts in my Korean barns,

41
00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:25.990
so people who are already down that path.
When we started dating,

42
00:04:25.991 --> 00:04:30.010
when studying arts or anything within that field.

43
00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.070
Careerwise that's something to talk about.
You know,

44
00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.690
I can't talk about accounting because I don't know shit about accounting.

45
00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.340
So definitely like someone who aligns within my interests within the arts,

46
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.130
whether that be music,
physical painting,

47
00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.850
acting camera whenever.

48
00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:15.363
<v 4>Okay.</v>

49
00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:30.163
Sorry.

50
00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.850
<v 0>Hi.
Nice to meet everyone.
I'm going to talk to you Suzanne.
Nice.</v>

51
00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:40.710
Okay.
Nice to meet you,
Julia.
Nice to meet you.

52
00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:46.260
Nice to meet you guys.
Funny responses.
That was fun.
I was like,

53
00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.100
fine,
but also terrifying.

54
00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:51.390
I kind of wanted to shut myself that whole time.

55
00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.110
I thought it was this thing that we're all compatible.

56
00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:04.180
I was surprised at how many people had not been in a long term relationship.

57
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.390
Maybe I was too specific on my,
my dates,

58
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.630
but that was kind of interesting.
Just like,
you know,
from the get go.

59
00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:16.960
Yeah,
I guess.
I guess the,

60
00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.780
everyone's true colors comes out as time passes.

61
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.320
I guess getting the few preferences out first is kind of Nice,

62
00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:27.380
but I can't really say that I would want to get in a relationship with somebody

63
00:06:27.381 --> 00:06:32.180
based on just,
you know,
guidelines that I sat.
Yeah,
it's hard.
I'm not picky,
John,

64
00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.720
you know,
uh,
I'm a lover of all beings.

65
00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:38.630
That sounds fucking Tom,

66
00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.730
as always,
