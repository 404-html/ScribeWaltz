1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.150
Or like a peach you before in our relationships and in our you.

2
00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:10.580
Wow.
Can I be like,
oh Flolan Logan right to we're not there yet.

3
00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:11.623
No,

4
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.310
<v 1>thank you for coming.
Did you bring multiple resumes?</v>

5
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.990
I have like two or three extremely unprofessional.
Oops.
You got the job.

6
00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.590
<v 0>I can hear you.
Yeah.
That's like one hair that's like,</v>

7
00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:30.840
if it's like one hair that's like sticking up.

8
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:32.730
That's one hair sticking up so you can hear me.

9
00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:42.120
<v 2>We were dressed up in costumes.
Okay.
I was Starfox,</v>

10
00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.790
she was a Miss Marvel Nyan Cat Mashup cosplay and,

11
00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:49.420
and we were at a convention,

12
00:00:49.421 --> 00:00:53.320
so there's like thousands of people around us and like you can see her in like,

13
00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.030
it's like a needle in a haystack.

14
00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.260
Could not take my eyes off for the first time I saw her at the headphone.
Yeah.

15
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.310
<v 0>So we met on Halloween and I was deep in my phone planning all the parties we</v>

16
00:01:06.311 --> 00:01:08.680
had like three different parties were going to,

17
00:01:08.681 --> 00:01:13.681
and I was with a huge group of people and John Wasn't even a part of our group.

18
00:01:13.841 --> 00:01:16.870
He just randomly stumbled up and was like,
who was tough guys?

19
00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.680
And I look up and it was like God shined a light.

20
00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.630
I'm getting flustered just talking about this.

21
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.470
He had his sleeves rolled up and his arm,
I'm saying this

22
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.720
is arms look to,
so I got,
I was like,

23
00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.810
who is this man?
I said that uh,

24
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.720
you're very attractive.
Very attractive.

25
00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.850
<v 1>Okay.</v>

26
00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.480
<v 2>We went to a barcade and uh,</v>

27
00:01:50.481 --> 00:01:53.120
we went and played her favorite pin ball machine.

28
00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.990
I'm from the east coast and there's like nothing like that over there.

29
00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.830
It was like the coolest date I've ever been on in my life.
I'm not going to lie.

30
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.740
<v 0>I was really,
really nervous to go on this date with him because I was,</v>

31
00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.270
I felt like I was starting to like him and I didn't want him to know.

32
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.630
I also wanted to feel still like I was in control of this situation just in case

33
00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.750
he was a jerk or too good to be true.

34
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.210
But we ended up having like a really good time.

35
00:02:18.211 --> 00:02:20.520
We just like talked for like hours,

36
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.270
just about all of our favorite things and kind of got into a little bit more

37
00:02:24.271 --> 00:02:29.271
like serious talk about like our past relationships and what we expect.

38
00:02:29.551 --> 00:02:33.390
And it was just nice.
He was so easy to talk to in.

39
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.690
I hated it because I started to really like him.

40
00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
<v 2>I came out here and I just wanted to like work.</v>

41
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.920
We were going to be good friends and we're gonna help each other.

42
00:02:41.921 --> 00:02:45.290
I'm going to do stuff like that.
And um,
I tried to do that with you

43
00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.570
<v 0>when,</v>

44
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.170
cause we had been kind of like dating for so long and you're like never tried to

45
00:02:50.171 --> 00:02:52.720
kiss me.
I Dunno.
I didn't want to like mess things up.

46
00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.550
You didn't want it to happen.

47
00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.950
I think I was just scared of it happening and I'm like,

48
00:02:56.951 --> 00:03:00.400
I've been in other like longterm relationships in the past and I felt like I

49
00:03:00.401 --> 00:03:05.401
just put up with the person into sound reasons that like things that we had in

50
00:03:05.471 --> 00:03:08.680
common but never really felt like I connected with them.

51
00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.340
And with John it felt so instant and scary in right away.

52
00:03:12.341 --> 00:03:15.670
And kind of like what they talk about in the movies.

53
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.550
<v 2>Yeah.
Like it makes me nervous,
right?
Yeah.</v>

54
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.650
Our biggest fight so far,

55
00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.840
we're planning on moving.

56
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.080
She really wants to move inward towards Los Angeles and I want to move like out.

57
00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.620
I want to move like have like trees and grass and stuff like that.

58
00:03:37.621 --> 00:03:38.680
Cause that's like how am I grew up?

59
00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:41.810
I guess we're trying to come up with the best points to art.
Do you know

60
00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.410
<v 0>I have depression so when I'm like really hard on myself or things go really</v>

61
00:03:47.411 --> 00:03:51.200
bad,
I can spiral pretty quickly.
And um,

62
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.430
we got in this huge fight and it boiled down to the way we treat each other.

63
00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.390
Um,
in the balance,
the imbalance in a relationship,

64
00:04:01.391 --> 00:04:03.160
how is just work all the time.
There's,

65
00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:08.320
there's no time for us and no time for me.
How can we be happy together?

66
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.240
And initially I was just like,
fine,
just like forget it.
I'm done.

67
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.690
Like we don't need to be together.
It's easier for me to be alone.

68
00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.770
That's what I do when I'm like hurt and I want us to have something quickly,

69
00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.690
I push away.
Uh,
luckily John's very patient,

70
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.970
um,
can see through that mid pack.
Like,
all right,

71
00:04:30.971 --> 00:04:33.310
well if something's wrong here,
I just,
something bothers you.
You just,

72
00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.750
you got to tell me.
We have to be honest.
And uh,
if I was working too much,

73
00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.880
you know,
he'd tell me,
he'd be like,
all right,
enough.

74
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.230
Now it's time to take a break.

75
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.690
It was like we're loving each other in a different way.
Did,
did,
did,

76
00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.670
did you say the fight,
the fight?
Uh,

77
00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.510
Jardine,
Dang it.

78
00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.560
I brought up the big fight that we had in June.
They asked how I,

79
00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.990
we've gotten over it and I think as just being honest and setting harsher

80
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.770
boundaries has really,
really helped.

81
00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.330
<v 2>Even though it was scary,
I'll be honest,
I knew we were going to figure it out.</v>

82
00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.300
<v 0>See,
that's a positive mentality all the time.</v>

83
00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.080
<v 2>When I first met met Megan,
I didn't even,
I didn't know she was,
I honestly,</v>

84
00:05:14.081 --> 00:05:16.870
I didn't really watch you tube.
I even know what the terms of youtube are.
Men.

85
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.190
I guess I was just nervous because I never been in the spotlight before.

86
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:26.400
I've seen the magazine covers in grocery stores where like all of this drama

87
00:05:26.801 --> 00:05:30.790
happens in Hollywood between actors and stuff like that.
Do we,

88
00:05:30.791 --> 00:05:33.580
do we try to stay private?
Did we not?
Did we go public?

89
00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.050
I guess I changed the way that I presented myself to the public on social media.

90
00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.630
That was just more kid friendly.

91
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:46.030
<v 0>I think the biggest struggle that uh,
John I go through is separating our day.</v>

92
00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:51.150
The life of a Youtuber is 24 seven and I've been doing it for so long and it's,

93
00:05:51.151 --> 00:05:55.870
it's not a very stable career choice.
You're fighting for relevancy.

94
00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:57.740
My workdays can sometimes be,
you know,

95
00:05:57.741 --> 00:06:01.970
16 hours or I wasn't sleeping at certain times.

96
00:06:01.971 --> 00:06:04.640
I would get maybe two hours of sleep and a,

97
00:06:04.641 --> 00:06:07.250
that would really affect our relationship because John would be like,

98
00:06:07.251 --> 00:06:11.510
there's no balance.
We work all the time,
but there is no time to relax.

99
00:06:11.511 --> 00:06:12.201
If you're relaxed,

100
00:06:12.201 --> 00:06:16.880
you feel guilty and it hasn't been easy and because we have something so
special,

101
00:06:16.881 --> 00:06:21.770
it's definitely worth fighting for more.
We're picking it out.
It's bigger.

102
00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:23.323
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

103
00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:31.840
<v 2>I dunno if you guys have a word for it.
I do.
Me and my,
my brother do.</v>

104
00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:36.790
We were like,
if we could ever find that the true one is the golden leopard.

105
00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.620
It's the golden leopard right there.

106
00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:44.250
You know the unattainable person that matches your personality so perfectly.

107
00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:47.110
And you know,

108
00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:52.440
literally few days after Megan and I were seeing this as becoming a

109
00:06:53.141 --> 00:06:56.290
relationship,
I was like the Golden Leopard is,

110
00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:59.230
is not even the right word.

111
00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:03.790
Like she's a Rainbow Unicorn.
Know like riding on a rocket ship

112
00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:05.700
<v 0>psych you,</v>

113
00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:10.880
you searched your whole life for this feeling that you read about in fairy tales

114
00:07:12.091 --> 00:07:13.680
and you've seen in movies,

115
00:07:13.681 --> 00:07:17.490
but you kind of like come to terms with the fact that doesn't exist.

116
00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:19.440
I met John in it.

117
00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:21.920
<v 2>I know it's just right.</v>

118
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.710
Even though I'm over here in La and yeah,

119
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:32.860
all my family is back on the other coast.
I feel like home with you,
you know,

120
00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:37.760
and I've always felt like an outsider here.
You're my best friend and I love you.

121
00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:40.550
You're my best friend and I love you.

122
00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:43.783
<v 4>Wait.</v>

123
00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:53.010
