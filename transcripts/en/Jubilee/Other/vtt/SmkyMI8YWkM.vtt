00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.300
They definitely have to be open minded.
Um,

2
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.480
as long as you are willing to take yourself out of your body and see things from

3
00:00:12.151 --> 00:00:13.380
someone else's perspective,

4
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.780
that's all I can really ask for in a significant other.

5
00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:33.753
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

6
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.600
<v 0>First round again.</v>

7
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:54.673
<v 2>Okay.</v>

8
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:55.613
<v 1>Hm.</v>

9
00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.260
<v 0>I'm an introvert.</v>

10
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.030
I would enjoy someone that is a little bit more extroverted,

11
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.740
trying to,
not someone that's like,

12
00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.270
it goes off the handle and it was just like bouncing everywhere.

13
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.910
<v 1>Whenever you're ready.</v>

14
00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.780
<v 0>I don't want to date like a gym rat where like every day and that's all they</v>

15
00:01:44.781 --> 00:01:49.130
want to do.
Um,
but I mean,

16
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.970
someone else that has that as like a priority in their life as well.

17
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.080
Just the help motivate me to also like,
Hey,
all right.

18
00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:58.910
I know you're tired,

19
00:01:58.911 --> 00:02:02.300
but like just get off your ass and just being able to quick workout.

20
00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.810
<v 1>Hmm.
Hmm.</v>

21
00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.063
Hmm.

22
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.670
Hmm.
Hmm.

23
00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:25.453
Hmm.

24
00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.893
<v 2>All right.</v>

25
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.120
<v 0>I've actually been a smoker since I was 18.</v>

26
00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.480
I have switched off of cigarettes to vaping.

27
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.910
I know it's noxious,

28
00:02:47.911 --> 00:02:50.820
the people that don't understand the why,

29
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.730
but that is something that is a part of my daily life.

30
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:08.613
<v 2>Okay.</v>

31
00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.073
Right.

32
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:31.593
<v 0>Sexual,</v>

33
00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.800
I'm not trying to get choked out or you know,

34
00:03:39.801 --> 00:03:44.570
have like a rope around my throat.
Um,
small kinks are fine.

35
00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:49.600
Like I guess I'll draw the line of like no feet just cause I'm not interested in

36
00:03:50.391 --> 00:03:53.150
that and I don't want anyone touching mine.
So

37
00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.073
<v 2>Oh</v>

38
00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.260
<v 0>more open minded.</v>

39
00:04:22.261 --> 00:04:26.670
You are the more willing you are to see where the other person is coming from

40
00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.210
and hopefully meet them just because people that are generally closed minded you

41
00:04:33.211 --> 00:04:38.211
can't really have like open discussions with actually like try to get some work

42
00:04:38.281 --> 00:04:40.080
is already set in their ways.

43
00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:48.390
Extremely liberal or on the flip side if you're extremely conservative like even

44
00:04:48.391 --> 00:04:50.700
though I might share more views with you,

45
00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.660
once again you'll be more closed minded towards other people that don't share

46
00:04:54.661 --> 00:04:55.494
similar views.

47
00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:26.160
My Dad got married when he was 20 [inaudible] 22 and 26 not even close.

48
00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:29.200
Um,

49
00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:34.200
but I would prefer probably be at least married by 30.

50
00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:05.430
I actually am looking for something more I guess solid.

51
00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:10.690
I'm tired of just like dating people for like Oh hey six months,

52
00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:15.400
four months.
I'm actually looking for like long term at this point.

53
00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:16.463
<v 2>Hmm.</v>

54
00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.970
<v 0>There are some pretty witty people,
which is fun.</v>

55
00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:56.170
Like regardless of the people that left early or the people that stayed all the

56
00:06:56.171 --> 00:07:00.310
way to the end,
it was a pleasure talking to all of them,

57
00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:07.140
I guess.
That's
nice to meet you guys with John,
so yeah,

58
00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:08.110
we'll see where it goes.

59
00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:13.220
<v 1>Yeah.</v>
