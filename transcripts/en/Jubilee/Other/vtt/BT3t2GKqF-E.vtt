1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.020
Yeah.
To me at the time I thought this is it.
Like we are not compatible.

2
00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:08.890
Like we actually may break up after this trip when we get home.
Thank you.

3
00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.960
Nice to meet you.
Happy to do this.
I know

4
00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.170
I'm Wally and I'm walking on her channel.

5
00:00:23.171 --> 00:00:27.520
We blog about food or pets just everyday,
daily life.

6
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.330
Our life is kind of interesting.
I don't know.
I guess it must be right.

7
00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.510
Our relationship with your best friends.

8
00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.220
It doesn't really feel like a relationship.
Yeah.
We're each other's best friend.

9
00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:40.083
Yeah,

10
00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.350
so I met him when we were in middle school and I thought he was real queue.

11
00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.660
He was,
I'm really tall,
but when I heard his voice I was like,
Ooh,

12
00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.090
it sounds like a girl.
It's handed over

13
00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.030
<v 2>my first impression of her.
Um,
hey,
look,</v>

14
00:01:02.031 --> 00:01:05.930
another Chinese person in the town.
There wasn't much of an impression.

15
00:01:05.931 --> 00:01:07.550
It was just like,
oh,
and I'm the Chinese girl.

16
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.310
<v 0>How romantic.
He's looking at me in the eyes just saying.
Not at all.
No.</v>

17
00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.980
Colandra all right.
See how it is.

18
00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.890
<v 1>Ooh.</v>

19
00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.890
<v 0>Our first date was at a Sushi restaurant in our hometown.
I think Ellen,</v>

20
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.190
then we had frozen yogurt after that.
I don't think you're going to get this one.

21
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.020
I don't think he's going to remember
my first day.
Um,

22
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.640
<v 2>oh,
it's not a bait that was in the bay.
Oh Man.
I messed up.</v>

23
00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.290
We went to San Francisco.

24
00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.310
It's so hard cause it wasn't even like a date date like that.

25
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.180
It was just like me and her and her sister went out to San Francisco,

26
00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.200
<v 0>San Francisco.
That was the best Sushi at that really quiet restaurant.</v>

27
00:01:59.201 --> 00:02:03.770
That was our day to day.
Oh,

28
00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.020
he's made me become a better person.
He's always very,

29
00:02:11.021 --> 00:02:15.340
very considerate.
I've learned a lot from him.
Very,
very generous.

30
00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.390
Always willing to like help friends,
help family.
My family.

31
00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.980
He's really funny.
I think my sense of humor now comes from him.

32
00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.340
He's a great person and I love everything.

33
00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.450
<v 2>Patience.
She's got so much patience.</v>

34
00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.660
She puts up with so much,
um,

35
00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.110
me and everyone around her.

36
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.520
<v 0>Um,
I said everything pretty much everything.
Yeah.
Nicolock.
Why are you lying</v>

37
00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.130
<v 2>for me?
I said I love your patients the most.
Hmm.</v>

38
00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.840
You have some which patients for me and for everyone else around you.

39
00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.140
I should've said that one to learn some of that from you.

40
00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.170
<v 0>I don't think it's changed our relationship much.</v>

41
00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.380
I think it's taught both of us as individuals that we could be more mindful of

42
00:03:09.051 --> 00:03:13.010
things that we would say because we used to just have no filter at all.

43
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.883
<v 2>Uh,</v>

44
00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.750
I guess it would just be when we go out and if we go somewhere where we're

45
00:03:19.751 --> 00:03:21.400
getting noticed too much,

46
00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.510
but it has made us more comfortable with each other being on camera together.

47
00:03:25.511 --> 00:03:27.550
It's different from being together.

48
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:33.030
Being on camera together has made us realize things that we wouldn't if there

49
00:03:34.451 --> 00:03:35.440
was no camera around.

50
00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.710
<v 1>Okay.</v>

51
00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:40.310
<v 0>We always know when to take the break.
Like if ever we feel,
oh,</v>

52
00:03:40.311 --> 00:03:43.520
this is consuming too much of our lives,
then we'll take a break.

53
00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.120
I think it's most important to be yourself on camera because when you are not

54
00:03:51.021 --> 00:03:54.440
being yourself,
that's when you start changing.

55
00:03:54.441 --> 00:03:58.360
I guess that's what I think people started doing it for the right.
Right.

56
00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:03.350
Do you want to portray a perfect relationship?
Exactly.
Biggest fight together.

57
00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.400
I think the fight,
two months ago
we had a fight on vacation,

58
00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:14.490
so we were in Hawaii and this bus driver was really mean to me and our friends.

59
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.700
So he kind of like raised his voice at the bus driver.

60
00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.960
It's like I can't even get mad at him for this because he gets mad when he sees

61
00:04:22.961 --> 00:04:24.310
someone disrespecting me.

62
00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.630
So it comes from a place where he's being very protective of me at the moment I,

63
00:04:28.631 --> 00:04:30.370
I was mad at him.
I was like,
wow,
really?

64
00:04:30.371 --> 00:04:32.950
We're on vacation and you want to get in a fight with this bus driver.

65
00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.680
And then I told him why I was upset.
He told me why he was upset.

66
00:04:35.681 --> 00:04:36.970
We just didn't agree at the time.

67
00:04:36.971 --> 00:04:41.050
So throughout the entire vacation we were just ignoring each other.
My thought,

68
00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.681
this is it,

69
00:04:41.681 --> 00:04:46.681
like we are not compatible and we haven't talked for three days and I fault just

70
00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:48.670
even he doesn't want to work on it.

71
00:04:48.671 --> 00:04:50.740
And that's like the first time I've ever felt that from him.

72
00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:54.010
And I thought that would be the meaning of love.
You know

73
00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.180
<v 1>that you will</v>

74
00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.250
<v 0>always work that your problems together.</v>

75
00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.370
<v 2>We were in Hawaii,
we were in a trip.
Yeah.</v>

76
00:05:02.371 --> 00:05:06.050
I wish this I'm a really hard time for,

77
00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:12.040
for the both of us for her is because I made it a hard time for,
um,

78
00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.300
I wish this,
it was just a bad,

79
00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.320
that's all I can say.
It was just bad man.

80
00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:24.590
But I feel like through that argument we really have learned so much about each

81
00:05:25.321 --> 00:05:26.430
other.
Um,

82
00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.360
and it's crazy to think that light at almost seven years you,

83
00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:32.160
there's some more to learn about this person.

84
00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:37.820
I think that made me realize how much I need her and

85
00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.840
<v 0>how much I can do without her.</v>

86
00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:49.320
I think when I talked to my girlfriends or just people in general,
I was,

87
00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.250
I would always say,
Oh,
if you did that to me,
we're done.

88
00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.210
And I think a lot of people can easily say that because that's their pride

89
00:05:56.211 --> 00:06:01.070
speaking the one I realized how serious it was and that we were reaching a
point.

90
00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.730
Oh Wow.
Like we actually may break up after this trip when we get home.

91
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:10.100
That's when I reevaluated everything.
Why were even fighting?

92
00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:14.900
What does this mean to me and do I want to fix it?
[inaudible] did.
Yup.

93
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.440
<v 2>Thank you.
Thank you.</v>

94
00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:32.810
<v 0>Everything.
Um,</v>

95
00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:37.020
uh,
I mean my life would be shattered.

96
00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:42.960
Well,
I'm crying because that's like my worst nightmare.

97
00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:47.040
I feel like it's because I truly cannot live without him.

98
00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:48.960
<v 1>Okay.</v>

99
00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.490
<v 0>Yeah.
You're just my everything.</v>

100
00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:53.373
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

101
00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:57.450
<v 2>What do you too,
I wouldn't miss everything.</v>

102
00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:03.330
Literally everything.
Take one,
take one.

103
00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:09.010
We spend so much time with each other and we love it.
Um,

104
00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:15.080
that it really feels like she's like literally a part of me.

105
00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:21.770
Like we share a bond in between that if broken and actually hurts.

106
00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:28.620
Um,
I said,
I'll miss everything.
I'll probably die.

107
00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:31.950
Yeah.
Because I used to clean them,
know how to live.

108
00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:37.020
I said that we share a bond together.
That it feels like we're in the same body.

109
00:07:37.021 --> 00:07:40.900
That if any of that wasn't broken,
it would actually physically hurt.

110
00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:44.280
<v 0>[inaudible] you make it really easy to love you.</v>

111
00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:49.800
You make me happy,
make me feel safe,
make me feel beautiful.

112
00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:53.400
I think our relationship like that,

113
00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:58.570
<v 2>that we are really just best friends and not just seeing that we are best</v>

114
00:07:58.571 --> 00:07:58.900
friends.

115
00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:03.820
Like we really are just best friends and lovers.

116
00:08:03.821 --> 00:08:08.320
And I think that there's something in that that it's hard to explain to put it

117
00:08:08.321 --> 00:08:09.670
into words.
Yeah.

118
00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:11.710
<v 1>Whoa.</v>

119
00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:15.540
<v 0>I know love is a weird thing.
It is.
It is.
Cause it's,</v>

120
00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:18.880
it's more of a feeling you,
you know,

121
00:08:18.881 --> 00:08:23.470
why you like someone like a friend because certain things they do for you,

122
00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:26.980
but when you love someone,
it's,
it's just that feeling.

123
00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:29.230
I love you very much.

124
00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:34.360
<v 2>I said I could definitely see us lasting forever.
That it won't last forever.</v>

125
00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:35.630
<v 1>Okay.</v>
