1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.060
I believe everybody has the opportunity to choose what kind of sex they will

2
00:00:03.061 --> 00:00:05.550
have.
And so it can be sacred,

3
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.460
but then there's times I just want to be a dirty pig and just go out and do

4
00:00:08.461 --> 00:00:10.530
whatever I want.
And that's not saying great.

5
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.030
<v 2>Three two</v>

6
00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.930
<v 0>film in itself is art,
but art is also subjective.
So for myself,</v>

7
00:00:42.931 --> 00:00:47.040
I do believe that my work is on in some level at creative endeavor,

8
00:00:47.041 --> 00:00:49.390
which actually does reflect the art world.
Okay.

9
00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.440
I mean everything that we do is a creative endeavor.
I shoot a lot of features,

10
00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.100
which means I shoot a lot of movies that are actually filmed more like

11
00:00:57.101 --> 00:00:58.150
mainstream movies.

12
00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:03.180
It's basically the exact same except in the end we have sex.

13
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.030
Um,
so I said somewhat agree.
I'm still new to the industry,

14
00:01:08.031 --> 00:01:12.440
so I have not really done a lot of feature films.
I had a big productions,

15
00:01:12.441 --> 00:01:16.280
I still do the reality porn where it's like the piece of Guy,

16
00:01:16.281 --> 00:01:20.200
he rings the doorbell and then he fucks the,
the mill for something.

17
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.800
So I don't really see that as art in a way.

18
00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.050
As I sat that pizza guy up a certain way.

19
00:01:27.051 --> 00:01:30.290
You have to leave this the doorbell a certain way.
You have to hit the lighting,

20
00:01:30.291 --> 00:01:31.700
your hair lights back there.

21
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.393
<v 1>Okay.</v>

22
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.550
<v 2>Three,
two,
one.</v>

23
00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:44.163
Okay.

24
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.500
<v 0>The type of porn that minors we'll be able to get is most likely going to be</v>

25
00:01:50.061 --> 00:01:53.960
what's free on the Internet and there's a lot of things missing from the clips

26
00:01:53.961 --> 00:01:57.680
that are free on the Internet.
It's not very educational.

27
00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.950
It does not teach them the proper way that sex should be done.

28
00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.870
Consent Lube,
all of that stuff.
It's missing.

29
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.090
We do a lot of like fantasy roleplay and different things that like maybe you

30
00:02:09.091 --> 00:02:12.270
would want to do but you can't actually do in real life and so if a miner is

31
00:02:12.271 --> 00:02:12.811
watching it,

32
00:02:12.811 --> 00:02:16.170
they don't see what goes on behind the scenes where the partners are like

33
00:02:16.171 --> 00:02:19.590
communicating with each other like you can do this but like this or they don't

34
00:02:19.591 --> 00:02:22.240
ski consent happening on camera.

35
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.820
<v 3>Porn is a,
it's a fantasy.
It's just not reality.</v>

36
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.840
So a minor watching this is definitely going to get the wrong idea of what real

37
00:02:29.841 --> 00:02:34.310
sex is and how it's done,
how it started off,
how you meet a girl,

38
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.910
you're not going to be the pizza man too many times and it's an open to the

39
00:02:37.911 --> 00:02:40.610
piece and it's Dixon there.
Pause,
sexual harassment folks.

40
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.350
If they were able to watch this,

41
00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.070
I think sex would be a lot more numbing and a lot younger age and we don't want

42
00:02:46.071 --> 00:02:46.960
that as a society.

43
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.980
Like we still want sex to still be somewhat sacred to kids.

44
00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.510
<v 0>I'm going to say that I think pornography is a very important part of of</v>

45
00:02:58.361 --> 00:03:03.361
learning and also a minor is somebody who is under 18 so we're talking about 17

46
00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:08.500
1615 they're already probably watching porn or probably dealing with that I

47
00:03:08.501 --> 00:03:12.880
agreed is not the place somebody should learn about sex,
but if they're doing it,

48
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.430
how do we make it so it can be a positive thing

49
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.150
<v 3>you think they should have like like I don't know,</v>

50
00:03:18.151 --> 00:03:21.870
not softcore but like a boy yarn bite.
That's more education.

51
00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.173
<v 2>Okay.</v>

52
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:25.533
<v 0>Oh</v>

53
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.660
<v 2>32</v>

54
00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.690
<v 0>I have not shot interracial yet,
no matter what,</v>

55
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.680
they're going to end up making it so that there's a racist title,
like baby goes,

56
00:03:41.681 --> 00:03:46.270
blacked,
blacked on blondes,
big black cock on this little tiny white girl,

57
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:47.470
something like that.

58
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.360
And I get so much hate on Instagram on Twitter saying I'm racist saying
whatever.

59
00:03:52.361 --> 00:03:55.780
And I'm actually the opposite.
Totally.
I don't want to fucking do that.

60
00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.090
<v 3>There is a whole site,</v>

61
00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.630
I mean it's one of the biggest sites in our industry that is black and

62
00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.220
interracial.
Interracial.
Interracial is uh,
a white dude.

63
00:04:05.221 --> 00:04:08.190
What a Chinese girl in a interracial is,
anything is interracial.

64
00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:12.330
So for us to just consider the dark age guy with the whitest girl,

65
00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.020
I think that's,
it's just so stereotype and then they don't even do that.

66
00:04:16.021 --> 00:04:20.250
They make sure that the guy is gigantically huge or than the other girl.

67
00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.180
So it looks intimidating and then I feel like sometimes.

68
00:04:24.181 --> 00:04:27.600
Why else do you think that some people are intimidated by black culture?

69
00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:28.581
<v 0>It's really bad.</v>

70
00:04:28.581 --> 00:04:33.350
Like I've even gotten companies offering me like hundreds of dollars extra to

71
00:04:33.351 --> 00:04:34.520
shoe interracial.

72
00:04:34.521 --> 00:04:38.570
And it didn't occur to me until like company started dropping off or like I was

73
00:04:38.571 --> 00:04:40.760
getting all these comments being like,
oh my God,

74
00:04:40.761 --> 00:04:44.300
like you need a shoot with more black guys and then we need more PVC and stuff

75
00:04:44.301 --> 00:04:47.000
like that.
People want that.
That's the scary,

76
00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.830
that is the more scary part of this conversation.
People actually want racist.

77
00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.053
Wow.

78
00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.580
<v 2>Three,
two,
one.</v>

79
00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.500
<v 0>The day they found out,
the first day that my first scene came out,
my mom,</v>

80
00:05:10.501 --> 00:05:15.300
she called me and she was upset and then like a week after that she was like,

81
00:05:15.301 --> 00:05:18.570
you know,
I love you and like,
you're still welcome to come home.

82
00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.720
They're not all for a day,
still want me to go back to college.

83
00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:26.100
But they had my back.
I came from a very bad space as a trans guy and like,

84
00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.740
you know,
tried to commit suicide,
all kinds of stuff.

85
00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.230
So really I think my parents were just really happy on my live.

86
00:05:31.231 --> 00:05:33.750
I'm a hugely successful in the pornography business.

87
00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:37.290
So I think what I did is I taught my parents that this is a business.

88
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.960
It is not just dirty,
nasty porn in the back alley.
All right?

89
00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:44.730
It's actually a real lucrative business if you understand how to create a

90
00:05:44.731 --> 00:05:45.564
business from it.

91
00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.740
Most of my family knows what I do and like my parents say approve of it.

92
00:05:49.741 --> 00:05:53.130
They're like,
you do what you want,
you're an adult.
But like my extended family,

93
00:05:53.131 --> 00:05:57.180
my grandparents,
my cousins,
they're all Mormon.
They're super religious.

94
00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.810
I've been blocked on social media.
I've been like,

95
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.230
they don't invite me to family reunions anymore just cause they're like,

96
00:06:03.231 --> 00:06:07.520
you can do what you want but because our religion views it this way,

97
00:06:07.521 --> 00:06:11.150
we're not comfortable with you being like around our kids and stuff like that.

98
00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:11.400
Yeah.

99
00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.870
<v 3>What makes it sad is like it does make you feel like people forget the person</v>

100
00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:21.120
that you are.
Like it's just a job.
Like this is just a job for me.

101
00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:29.120
<v 2>Three,
two,
one.</v>

102
00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.210
<v 0>I have my husband,</v>

103
00:06:36.211 --> 00:06:40.500
we are open and we're in a poly relationship and I'm learning that,
you know,

104
00:06:40.501 --> 00:06:44.190
you get what you want.
And so if you're not cool with what I do,

105
00:06:44.191 --> 00:06:47.240
then you don't get to talk to me.
I don't,
I struggle is,
um,

106
00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:50.510
the monogamous part because if you're with me,

107
00:06:50.511 --> 00:06:55.100
we have to be open because I'm going to be out with other people a lot.

108
00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.350
And I was married and it got,

109
00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:02.120
we ended it because he wanted to be monogamous and he couldn't handle seeing me

110
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:04.640
go out with other people.
And it's like,

111
00:07:04.641 --> 00:07:08.120
it gets to a point with people where they're like,
okay,

112
00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:11.300
do we want to be monogamous or are we going to be open?

113
00:07:11.301 --> 00:07:13.970
Can I even handle being open?
Like,
you know,

114
00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:18.790
<v 3>I was engaged to somebody in the industry and you know,</v>

115
00:07:18.791 --> 00:07:23.290
it's not easy to find a person that you have a real connection with innocent

116
00:07:23.291 --> 00:07:24.124
history.
You know,

117
00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:28.660
sometimes porn can destroy,
you know,

118
00:07:28.661 --> 00:07:32.500
relationships and can destroy people.
You know,
cause

119
00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:39.400
I don't have her anymore.
And honestly,

120
00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:41.710
I don't know if I ever will.
You know,

121
00:07:41.711 --> 00:07:46.711
because sometimes what it does and people immensely can scar you.

122
00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:48.880
I didn't want to accept it for what it was.

123
00:07:48.881 --> 00:07:51.430
I didn't want to think that porn was really hurting.

124
00:07:51.431 --> 00:07:55.930
My relationship were really hurting her as much as it was at times.
He just,

125
00:07:55.931 --> 00:08:00.430
nothing you can do when you just,
like I say,
you live and you learn.

126
00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:04.680
<v 0>There's a lot of things that happen that people don't understand when we go to</v>

127
00:08:04.681 --> 00:08:07.210
work.
We are disconnected from intimacy.
Yeah.

128
00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:11.040
They people don't know how to do that in their own lives so they don't believe.

129
00:08:11.041 --> 00:08:13.340
I think a lot of times they don't believe us because a lot of times

130
00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:16.680
<v 3>tell me what you think.
It's just normal sex.
I'm like,
Yo,
I'm angled like this.</v>

131
00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:17.990
<v 4>I am backwards.</v>

132
00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:22.730
I'm like making sure the light's getting inside of here so you guys can see

133
00:08:22.731 --> 00:08:25.220
what's going on.
Like I'm not on top of this girl.

134
00:08:25.221 --> 00:08:27.770
How you here and kissing her and making love to her like that's what I would do

135
00:08:27.771 --> 00:08:28.420
at home.

136
00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:31.920
<v 0>It is a completely a job.
We are disconnected.
It is you're,</v>

137
00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:36.040
you're doing all of this as a motion and as an actor you're an actor

138
00:08:39.910 --> 00:08:42.570
<v 2>three,
two,
one.</v>

139
00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:52.100
<v 0>So I uh,
personally I think it's a very personal choice.</v>

140
00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:55.170
I believe everybody has the opportunity to choose what kind of sex they will

141
00:08:55.171 --> 00:08:57.840
have,
how they want to have sex,
when they want to have sex,

142
00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.550
why they want to have sex.

143
00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:03.960
And so it can be sacred in a situation where I might want feel like I have a

144
00:09:03.961 --> 00:09:06.430
lover and I want to keep it very personal and I don't want to,

145
00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:09.360
but then there's times I just want to be a dirty pig and just go out and do

146
00:09:09.361 --> 00:09:13.700
whatever I want.
And that's not sacred.
Like there's relationships,

147
00:09:13.701 --> 00:09:16.440
sex that you actually feel for the person and stuff.

148
00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:19.860
And then there's genital sex where you just want to fucking get off.
Right.

149
00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:24.270
When I was 18 I those couple of years from 18 to 21 in the industry,

150
00:09:24.271 --> 00:09:25.890
I was a mess.

151
00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:30.390
I didn't know how to separate my personal life from my porn life.

152
00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:33.900
I can't be eight and actually 24 seven and when I first got in the industry,

153
00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:35.160
I thought that that's who I was.

154
00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:38.490
I was ordering my Starbucks coffee and telling them I was Aiden.
Okay.

155
00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:40.140
And that's how I knew that,

156
00:09:40.141 --> 00:09:45.141
like I needed to come back and still have my real self and then be able to turn

157
00:09:46.291 --> 00:09:47.810
into eight.
And when I go to set,

158
00:09:57.250 --> 00:10:01.210
I would like some business cards.
Instagrams knew as soon as everything,

159
00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:03.560
like I'm easy to find me.
I'm on every,
yeah.

160
00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:08.480
