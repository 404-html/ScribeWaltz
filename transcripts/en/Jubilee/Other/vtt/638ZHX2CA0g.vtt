1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.620
The girl he was dating and the boy I was dating cheated on us with each other

2
00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.090
and got together.

3
00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:11.223
<v 1>Wow.</v>

4
00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.180
<v 2>Like guesstimate.
Yes.</v>

5
00:00:18.181 --> 00:00:21.860
What you're doing with that.
We're not going to be very good at those [inaudible]

6
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.790
<v 0>gate there.
And how long have I been dating?
Five years.</v>

7
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.630
<v 3>Yeah,
it's been awhile.
It was good man.
This is five years.
Hey,</v>

8
00:00:31.631 --> 00:00:32.464
can you hear me right now?

9
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:33.793
<v 2>Okay.</v>

10
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.460
<v 3>First Time I saw her really I was in so much pain.</v>

11
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.860
It was a girl that was putting my makeup on like for the Tattoo.
Yeah.

12
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.350
And she was like rubbing it off all the time with alcohol as burning.

13
00:00:49.351 --> 00:00:52.620
And I was like,
hey,
you gotta smile.
And so then Emily,

14
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.340
she was doing costumes and so she came along and she started like doing it with

15
00:00:56.341 --> 00:00:57.010
makeup.
I was like,

16
00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.710
it's a little easier cause then you take a baby wipe and wipe it away.
Scott,

17
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.490
like really big brown eyes and everything.
So they always looked on a happy,

18
00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.090
<v 0>oh he was tall,
dark and handsome,
which was very attractive.</v>

19
00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.620
I was a costume designer on almost Maine and he was actually in the show.

20
00:01:18.621 --> 00:01:21.200
And I drew on his arm a tattoo every night.

21
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.780
He had a girlfriend at the time and had a boyfriend at the time.

22
00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.650
So I knew that like I wasn't gonna Flirt with him or anything like that.

23
00:01:27.651 --> 00:01:28.640
So we were just friends.

24
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.990
<v 2>Take [inaudible] was you said though,</v>

25
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.260
everything I said after the first question is so quiet is your attorney.

26
00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.690
<v 3>I was really upset with by the idea of like loving and women and dates in</v>

27
00:01:43.691 --> 00:01:48.220
general.
So it was part of me being like I'm not paying for a woman ever again.

28
00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.270
Oh we went for ice cream and it was like two bucks and he was like how you guys

29
00:01:52.271 --> 00:01:55.660
got to pay it?
And I was like half and half.
You pay your half.

30
00:01:55.661 --> 00:01:58.750
I paid mine but then she gave me a look like no,

31
00:01:58.751 --> 00:02:01.930
you're going to pay for all of it.
So I was like,
all right,
okay.

32
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.200
And I paid for all of it and then I like tipping like 20 bucks,

33
00:02:05.201 --> 00:02:08.140
something like that.
Something ridiculous.
Cause I was like,
thanks for $2.

34
00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.090
Talk about like our summers,

35
00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.470
the situation and stuff and what love Mintz was.

36
00:02:14.471 --> 00:02:19.030
And how it changed us and where we go from now.

37
00:02:19.031 --> 00:02:23.380
And I was like,
I really want to kiss you right now.
And uh,
and then she was like,

38
00:02:23.381 --> 00:02:25.030
yeah,
sure.
And then yes.

39
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.550
<v 2>And it just stop right there.
Oh,
that was so weird.
You didn't overshare?</v>

40
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.833
No.

41
00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:36.440
<v 4>Okay.</v>

42
00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.630
<v 0>So this is a funny story,</v>

43
00:02:37.631 --> 00:02:42.340
but the girl he was dating and the boy I was dating cheated on us with each

44
00:02:42.341 --> 00:02:46.270
other and got together.
I walked up to him and I was like,
hey,

45
00:02:46.271 --> 00:02:49.830
so our x is our friends.
Uh,
maybe should,

46
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.630
you're like,
oh,
they're more than just friends in front of everybody.

47
00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.890
But after that we just started texting and hanging out.
Oh,

48
00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.880
we've pretty much been seeing each other ever since.

49
00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.720
<v 4>Okay.</v>

50
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.850
<v 3>Am I savagery mind?
I was already thinking,
okay,</v>

51
00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.620
now what I'm going to be when Emily,
that's what I'm gonna do.

52
00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.250
And you know what,
let me say it loud.
Like they're more than friends.

53
00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.510
I got her number and stuff.

54
00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.140
<v 0>He actually asked me out for ice cream and we're just going to hang out and uh,</v>

55
00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.590
actually talk about our exes because they were together now.

56
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.640
And so we're going to kind of compare notes and then we ended up kissing and it

57
00:03:27.641 --> 00:03:31.750
became our first date.
Oh yeah.
I didn't see you tell this story.

58
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.030
<v 3>Okay.
Why fala likes her more until,</v>

59
00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.630
until I hear on the phone with her friend Lauren,

60
00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.240
or right outside my window,
not realizing that I could hear it.
Everything.

61
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.170
Everything.
And like,
I'm like,
no,
no,
I don't think it's,

62
00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.590
it's not like a,
it's really nothing.
It just like a,

63
00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:58.540
it was a mess with other girls.
So I didn't know.

64
00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.390
I just got back to school.
It was like to,

65
00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.260
Ooh,
could I do anything with

66
00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.060
barbecue?
That is the first day back.
I didn't,

67
00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.140
<v 0>no.
You and it wasn't that day that I said that either.
It was later.</v>

68
00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:16.123
<v 4>No,</v>

69
00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.550
<v 0>I think I said it first.</v>

70
00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:23.780
You don't remember something?
What was that?

71
00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.280
<v 3>I kinda remember it.
Yeah.
I think,
yeah.</v>

72
00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:30.560
No,
no.

73
00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.470
<v 0>You don't have no idea what to answer this question real hard.</v>

74
00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:35.493
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

75
00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.850
What will your life be like if you had never met Kevin?

76
00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:44.630
<v 0>Oh Gosh.</v>

77
00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.390
I'd probably be living in Saint Louis because that's where my mom is.

78
00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:55.190
I would probably still be doing costume design cause right now I'm doing more

79
00:04:55.191 --> 00:04:58.180
freelance art and visual art paintings.
Um,

80
00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.520
cause he kind of supported my career change when we're doing stuff like this.

81
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:05.093
<v 4>Okay.</v>

82
00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:10.310
<v 3>Man.
Probably a lot cheaper.
Probably a lot more money.
I'll be honest.</v>

83
00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.220
I'll tell you right now since your ears are clogged,

84
00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.530
if I never met him when I feel like I'd still be

85
00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:21.950
<v 4>angrier in a way.
I like a lot of lifestyle.</v>

86
00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:24.300
<v 0>Oh Gosh.</v>

87
00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.240
I think I knew really soon after we started dating that I was in love with them.

88
00:05:27.241 --> 00:05:32.241
Just cause like he's such a good soul and he really likes these people for who

89
00:05:32.701 --> 00:05:33.450
they are.

90
00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:37.590
And when we met I was going through a hard time with a breakup just like he was.

91
00:05:37.591 --> 00:05:41.910
And to be seen for who I really was and what makes me unique and to not be

92
00:05:41.911 --> 00:05:46.340
judged to not care.
Just to like spending time with me and want to be with me.
It,

93
00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:50.040
it meant a lot and it does to this day.
It definitely means a lot to me.

94
00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:58.690
<v 3>Uh,
I love you because</v>

95
00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:03.710
everything I prayed for her whenever I,
uh,

96
00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:09.720
thought about having a girlfriend or stuff that other girls like dinner do

97
00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:18.240
literally everything.
And so,
ah,
all right,
these are real now.

98
00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:22.260
But y'all going to edit this out?
Um,
I just,

99
00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:29.790
we talk about how to change stuff up and it's easy to change stuff up so,

100
00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:32.493
and

101
00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:37.990
they're supportive like I've never had support before

102
00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:45.260
and yeah,
I can't lose you because I need you

103
00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:55.340
<v 2>now.
We're talking about how he got real.</v>

104
00:06:55.341 --> 00:06:58.010
Most of them I saw I'd love you because

105
00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:03.040
<v 3>I didn't say that though olive juice is because,</v>

106
00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:04.810
<v 2>oh,
I believe that too.</v>

107
00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:09.950
<v 3>Then buddy over there was opening up onions and stuff.
It was crazy in here.</v>

108
00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:14.670
I surprised him.
The affect you
uh,

109
00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.270
I just said that.
Okay,

110
00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:25.340
<v 2>they're gonna made me cry.
I don't know what it is.
Your emotional,</v>

111
00:07:25.341 --> 00:07:26.430
I'm going to make me cry.

112
00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:32.010
<v 3>Uh,
I just said that like,
yeah,
here's everything.</v>

113
00:07:32.011 --> 00:07:37.011
I prayed for his girlfriend and they're loyal and very supportive.

114
00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:42.970
I said something like that,
and,
and I say,

115
00:07:42.971 --> 00:07:47.060
it'll be a lot cheaper meeting without you and for me,
an artist twice New York,

116
00:07:47.061 --> 00:07:48.030
and you know the deal.

117
00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:49.683
<v 2>Ah,</v>

118
00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:54.280
<v 3>we break up right when we leave leaving</v>

119
00:07:58.210 --> 00:07:59.790
<v 2>allergies.
Oh my God.</v>

120
00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:04.780
Let me baby.
That's it,

121
00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:12.340
dad.
Oh my gosh.
