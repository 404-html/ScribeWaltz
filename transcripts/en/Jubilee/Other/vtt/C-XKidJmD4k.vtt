1
00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.550
I don't know what they wanted.
I just wanted to know where's this going?

2
00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.810
What are we doing here?
I remember that night.
I'm sure they both do.

3
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:29.100
<v 2>My name is Jason and I've been with Joe for Toby or technically newlyweds cause</v>

4
00:00:29.891 --> 00:00:31.380
he just got married and not so great.

5
00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.000
<v 0>Uh,
my name is Joe.</v>

6
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.100
You've started this relationship for a few months.

7
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.730
My name is Matthew.
Um,
I wasn't expecting this to happen.

8
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.740
I was hanging out with them and then things just happen.

9
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.350
<v 1>Hey Jason,
can you hear me?
Hey Matthew.
Perfect.
Ready?</v>

10
00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:59.593
Yeah.

11
00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.660
<v 3>Were you worried about being Paul are Amish?</v>

12
00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.020
<v 0>Um,
no,</v>

13
00:01:03.021 --> 00:01:08.021
I wasn't really worried like ever since I've been with Jason I've always thought

14
00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.960
love who you love.
And I've never just made it into just one person.

15
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.630
<v 3>I wasn't worried about it because I feel like everything is an experience and I</v>

16
00:01:24.151 --> 00:01:26.040
feel like we should experience these types of things.

17
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.340
I was actually with somebody else and I felt like that just wasn't going

18
00:01:31.621 --> 00:01:35.700
anywhere anymore.
And so eventually something just pushed me to be like,

19
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.590
I just need to be happy and I seen to go for it.

20
00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.400
And so I decided to leave the person that I was with and to start pursuing this.

21
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.380
And I think the biggest thing I was scared of is what everyone one's perception

22
00:01:46.381 --> 00:01:48.660
was going to be.
But when it comes down to it,
it doesn't matter.

23
00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.910
I'm not doing anything wrong.
I don't think so.

24
00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:56.263
<v 1>Mm.</v>

25
00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.880
<v 2>I think in the beginning there is always that like uncertainty.
We're like,
okay,</v>

26
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.050
for me in general,
like we're really open.
So if we're like,
okay,
you know,

27
00:02:06.051 --> 00:02:10.970
we both really feel him and like we both,
why him,

28
00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.660
this is who I want in our relationship.

29
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:15.593
<v 1>Okay.</v>

30
00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:18.183
<v 3>What do you think,</v>

31
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.670
<v 2>I think I just bring this sense of joy and peace.</v>

32
00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.060
What do you think that Joe brings to the relationship?

33
00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.280
Responsibility?
Cause he's always like,

34
00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.510
he's always like,
don't do this,
don't do that.

35
00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.540
Matt brings,
I'm like in love with Matthew.

36
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.333
So,

37
00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.590
and of course I'm in love with Joe and I have been for 12 years,

38
00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.700
but like Matthew coming in,
it's like,

39
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.700
it's like those butterflies again.
You know what I mean?

40
00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.620
So I'm sure Joe feels same.

41
00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.670
<v 0>I think I bring humor.
I think I bring,
um,</v>

42
00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.850
a sort of calmness.
Jason is,
he says he's not that smart.

43
00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.370
I mean he could be kind of dumb when he says things,

44
00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.520
but I think he brings intellect and then Matthew as much older as we are,

45
00:03:18.481 --> 00:03:23.481
he brings us new experiences that I haven't been known or haven't seen.

46
00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.400
Definitely a sensitive adventure.

47
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.980
<v 3>I think Joe brings like a more,
so if something goes wrong in my life,</v>

48
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.960
I'm not going to be like,
hey Jason,
it sounds messed up.
I'm not going to be like,

49
00:03:37.961 --> 00:03:41.530
Hey Jason,
I need your help with this.
I'm going to be like Joe,
like I need x,
Y,

50
00:03:41.531 --> 00:03:44.500
and z.
This is happening right now.
Like what can we do?

51
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.870
I think Jason allows me to not be so uptight and not be so caught up in myself

52
00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:55.030
and they bring out these different parts of me that I don't think one person has

53
00:03:55.031 --> 00:03:57.220
been able to do for him yet.
So

54
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.073
yeah.

55
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:06.160
Do you ever worry that you would love one of them less than the other?

56
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.833
<v 1>I don't know.</v>

57
00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.810
<v 2>I think it's sorta like I'd given that I will love Joe more considering the,</v>

58
00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.910
the dynamic and the duration and experienced that me and she'll been together

59
00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.750
and I don't think Matthew would be surprised about that.
However,

60
00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.260
as far as like the love that I put out into this relationship,

61
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.680
I don't want that to be an EPN are and distributed equally.

62
00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.300
<v 0>I love both of them really do this love is pretty,</v>

63
00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:46.360
I feel like it's locked then
and this love is very like,

64
00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:50.920
it's fresh love,
so it's a work in progress kind of love.

65
00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.610
I don't say it's like loving one person more than the other.

66
00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:01.350
<v 3>I think that we experience different people in our lives for different reasons.</v>

67
00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.250
For me,
I don't think it's a matter of me loving one person more than the other.

68
00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.880
I think that I loved them differently and I think that's expected because

69
00:05:09.881 --> 00:05:12.970
they're different people.
So not one person.

70
00:05:12.971 --> 00:05:14.890
Am I going to love the same way as I love another person.

71
00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:17.860
<v 1>What do you think is the hardest part about the relationship</v>

72
00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.540
<v 2>is just,
I don't know.</v>

73
00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:27.410
I Guess Matthew to be on this because me and Joe,

74
00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:33.710
I sorta have that stability and that security that I have and then Matt coming

75
00:05:34.441 --> 00:05:39.240
into this relationship and me being like so in Aberdeen and infatuated with him,

76
00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:43.020
it's like where does he stand?
Like where,

77
00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.280
when can I have that stability or that security?

78
00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:52.800
So okay,
if this doesn't work out and they ended up together and I'm alone,

79
00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:56.910
that's just my,

80
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.010
but of course they decide to be the one to be left out.

81
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:09.400
I know my character and I know there's so if they feel like they'd want to move

82
00:06:11.641 --> 00:06:15.300
on without me,
that'd be okay with that.

83
00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:19.340
<v 3>Think the hardest thing for me is what's next.</v>

84
00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:21.470
And I think that's a normal thing to feel,

85
00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.790
but I don't want to keep dwelling on what's next.
Even though I do,

86
00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:26.653
I'm guilty of it.

87
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:31.820
I just want to keep living in the now and keep pushing this forward instead of

88
00:06:31.821 --> 00:06:33.290
trying to worry about what's coming.

89
00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.200
<v 0>I don't necessarily care what people say,</v>

90
00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:44.020
but I know there are negative people and they don't want to understand.

91
00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:48.850
But like if you open your mind,
if you just like anything,

92
00:06:48.851 --> 00:06:53.050
open your mind to anything,
I think that's when you can stop being so negative.

93
00:06:53.051 --> 00:06:56.020
And I feel like some people just do that because they aren't happy about

94
00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:57.160
themselves.

95
00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:02.460
<v 2>Does your family know your poly?
Everyone,
but my mind,
I dunno.</v>

96
00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:07.280
It's like almost coming out again.
It's like being gay was one thing.

97
00:07:07.281 --> 00:07:12.281
I already got kicked out for that and I think I'm just scared that she'd be

98
00:07:12.501 --> 00:07:15.350
like,
what the heck?

99
00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:20.980
<v 3>I've never really told them,</v>

100
00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:24.400
but they see it on social media.

101
00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:31.420
I think I expect a reaction when I tell people like,
I'm like,
oh cool.
Look,

102
00:07:31.421 --> 00:07:34.160
people were asking me what's going on in my life right now?
Um,

103
00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:37.810
I think the craziest one to tell what was going on was

104
00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:43.780
actually my mother.
Um,
but I mean,

105
00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.350
when it came down to it,
she's like,
hey,
like as long as you're happy,

106
00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:51.280
I'm not going to stop you from being happy.
And not a lot of people have that.

107
00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:53.890
Some people can't even tell their parents that they're gay.

108
00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:58.450
And I'm lucky enough to be like,
hey mom,
I'm gay.
And I'm seeing two people.

109
00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:03.100
All right.
How do you all feel right now?

110
00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:10.960
<v 2>I can read my name and they can see you.
I can remind to Matthew,</v>

111
00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:14.480
Matthew.
Matthew,
what about

112
00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:21.560
I love you both.
So if you're happy together alone,

113
00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:28.790
I'd be okay with it eventually.
But I think saw me off guard.

114
00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:30.620
I said that too.

115
00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:33.750
<v 0>Um,
I agreed.
Um,</v>

116
00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:39.240
we do believe in many different variables so these things might happen and if

117
00:08:39.241 --> 00:08:42.990
they happen,
they will happen.
That's why I think we are,

118
00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:47.440
we're less hurt about it because
will you ever need to know?

119
00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:49.330
There's so many situations.
Yeah,

120
00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:51.173
<v 2>I love you both.</v>

121
00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:55.920
We'll see where ends up.

122
00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:02.280
<v 3>Hey everyone,
if you're lonely like me,
subscribe,
then we can be lonely together.</v>

123
00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:06.030
Uh,
and if you want to just check out more videos,
you can watch him right here.

124
00:09:06.031 --> 00:09:09.420
Cause if you're lonely,
you probably have nothing else to do.
So in the meantime,

125
00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:12.210
I will be right here waiting for you at the end of another,
both sides up.

126
00:09:12.211 --> 00:09:13.890
So peace,
love and blessings.
