00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.640
People have a hard time talking about money because money is the root of all of

2
00:00:05.641 --> 00:00:06.474
our problems.

3
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:12.120
My relationship with money is I don't like understand money.

4
00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:30.940
<v 1>My other
sock,</v>

5
00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.350
<v 0>my name is Quinn,
I'm 22 years old and I live in San,</v>

6
00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.080
I'm a software engineering intern at a small startup.

7
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.230
Do you mind telling me how your day started?

8
00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.950
I woke up and then went in my car to get something and found out that it had

9
00:00:50.131 --> 00:00:53.100
been towed.
And how much did that cost?
Okay,

10
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.240
I got a 90 something dollar discount cause that was the first time my car had

11
00:00:58.241 --> 00:01:03.180
been towed.
It still came out to almost $600 or sorry today?

12
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.760
Yeah,
minus 600.

13
00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.710
I'm paid $2,000 a week for a 40 hour a week.
That's $50 an hour.

14
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.911
Um,

15
00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:21.390
so computer science is something I had just dabbled in as a requirement for my

16
00:01:21.391 --> 00:01:24.140
math degree and then I just

17
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.013
<v 1>decided to do it</v>

18
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:30.230
and he's with me as well.

19
00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.860
<v 2>I'm Dawley Avenue.
I am 23 years old and I live in Los Angeles,
California.</v>

20
00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.090
I make a living using my camera to take pictures.

21
00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.320
So like great thing about freelancing is you never really know how much you're

22
00:01:53.321 --> 00:01:57.820
going to make you take your,
um,
four or five games.

23
00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.950
<v 0>So I like safe loss loss of,
I don't got to work in c plus plus a lot.</v>

24
00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.570
What kind of programming do you want to go into?
Problems with application.

25
00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:10.280
Oh Gosh.
Good luck

26
00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.110
<v 1>keys.</v>

27
00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:15.453
<v 3>Ooh,</v>

28
00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.200
cute.
Oh my gosh.
Wait,

29
00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:29.700
getting into the office.

30
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.080
I probably spend about 30 minutes to an hour just figuring out what I was doing

31
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:35.970
last time I was working.

32
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.300
I like where I work a lot right now.
Do I love coding?

33
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.530
No.
It's too much of how the sausage is made.

34
00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:50.980
<v 0>Thank you for the tea.</v>

35
00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:54.241
<v 2>Hey,</v>

36
00:02:54.241 --> 00:02:59.241
we were shooting with Brooke who wanted to make a calendar for her boyfriend.

37
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.710
<v 1>Bubbles.
Yeah.
Nice.</v>

38
00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.210
It's going to be fun.
Fit Five 30 east eighth street.
I'm assuming this way.

39
00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.830
Friends.
Sweet.

40
00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.960
Thanks.
It's an intimate space.

41
00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.730
No,
straight on.
More angle.
Do you want me sitting and stuff anyways?
Yeah,
be cool.

42
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:43.130
Um,
yeah,
just let me know of anything else but get eh,

43
00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.180
<v 2>my favorite thing to photograph hands down is people.</v>

44
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.680
I absolutely love the energy and understanding somebody's,

45
00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.830
I think that's what what makes me keep creating,

46
00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.433
<v 1>okay.</v>

47
00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.780
<v 2>Take so much for someone to be completely confident and vulnerable.</v>

48
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.810
So allowing me into their space and capturing their soul in a sense.

49
00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:20.640
I think that's rewarding.

50
00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.530
<v 1>He's like,
great.
And if you smile smelled that way.
Okay.</v>

51
00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.410
Did you see one go smile.

52
00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.880
Yeah,
it's fine.

53
00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.800
Engineering slack this morning,
like anybody else.

54
00:04:36.801 --> 00:04:40.370
Upgrade to EMX 26 is working swimmingly.

55
00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.730
Can I grab both finished and goat cheese quiche and a macho latte.

56
00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.080
<v 0>I think that people problems are more interesting than technical problems.</v>

57
00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.190
So my favorite part of my day as a software developer is when I got to solve the

58
00:04:59.191 --> 00:05:00.330
problem with someone else.

59
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.430
So I guess I could be happier if I was just teaching high school.

60
00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:08.533
Pursue that.

61
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.250
I think it's important that you aim for things you're passionate about but that

62
00:05:14.251 --> 00:05:17.000
need not be grounded in your career.
Like,

63
00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:21.000
I would not want my parents to feel insecure about my future.

64
00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:27.270
After my third semester of college,
my dad was diagnosed with multiple Myeloma,

65
00:05:27.271 --> 00:05:30.980
which is a type of bone marrow cancer and I'm his only child.
Um,

66
00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.590
so it fell on me to take care of him.
Luckily he came out the other side.

67
00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.360
There was no way I could value two years in the middle of my life over two years

68
00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:40.463
potentially.

69
00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:46.660
My decision to take care of him was very like logical cause that's the type of

70
00:05:46.661 --> 00:05:48.520
person I am.
That's the way I solve problems.

71
00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:51.353
<v 1>Okay.</v>

72
00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:57.240
That's okay.
Busy

73
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.790
like where the Kardashians and who are just having somebody,

74
00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:17.143
he can hear me.

75
00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:27.720
<v 2>These are going to look so good.</v>

76
00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:33.630
I had a tough life because my parents were incompatible.

77
00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:37.380
Emotional abuse,
physical abuse.
On top of that,

78
00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:42.150
they didn't have an education.
They're trying to find a job,

79
00:06:42.151 --> 00:06:47.151
trying to find a place to live and having children to take care of our

80
00:06:48.031 --> 00:06:51.000
circumstances put us in situations that weren't ideal.

81
00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:56.790
That's how he grew up and from there we just kind of learned how to survive.

82
00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.210
I think like with money,

83
00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:05.220
if you make the effort to change your mentality and your lifestyle,

84
00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:10.580
that goes even with your career and if you're open minded to change like you can

85
00:07:12.001 --> 00:07:13.890
pursue anything that you put your mind to.

86
00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:16.320
That's where I'm trying to do with art.

87
00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:19.303
<v 1>Look back at me.</v>

88
00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:24.170
Got To Photoshop your friend out.

89
00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:33.293
Okay.

90
00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:45.763
<v 4>Wow.</v>

91
00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:59.380
<v 2>Do you believe that money defines yourself or others?</v>

92
00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:01.383
Yes.

93
00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:02.893
<v 1>Oh,</v>

94
00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:07.060
<v 2>money is part of what turns you into who you are.</v>

95
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.440
In almost every person that I've ever met,

96
00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:15.040
<v 3>I wish it were different.</v>

97
00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:23.270
<v 2>I don't think money defines you.
I think your character defines you.</v>

98
00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:28.690
I think how you treat people to find you and also how you treat yourself defines

99
00:08:29.601 --> 00:08:30.434
you.

100
00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:32.850
<v 1>Okay.</v>

101
00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:34.350
<v 3>It's kind of ingrained in us,
right?</v>

102
00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:37.950
Money is quiet literally how much you are worth,

103
00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:41.100
no matter how you try to spin it.
Like there is a number

104
00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:46.950
and I'm sure to some degree we all say that it doesn't like money can't buy

105
00:08:46.951 --> 00:08:50.730
happiness.
Right,
but a lack of money.
You can lose you some happiness.

106
00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:52.283
Are you happy?

107
00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:57.880
I think I'm happy I wake and look forward to my day.

108
00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:01.440
Could I be happier?
Yes,
absolutely.

109
00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:06.750
Like it's not in my nature to pinpoint what would make me happier.

110
00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:12.060
<v 2>Everybody wants to strive for more.</v>

111
00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:16.770
I think I'm happy in terms of I'm making art and I'm getting paid for it.

112
00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:22.710
I didn't really have anything and I was happy.
So because of that,

113
00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:26.850
at the end of the day,
I don't really feel like,

114
00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:29.703
<v 5>hmm,</v>

115
00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:31.393
<v 2>what's the question?</v>

116
00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:38.030
<v 0>So what's your day looking like?
You could do the math in your head.</v>

117
00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:42.050
A $400 a day.
Every day.
How much should I spend?

118
00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:44.690
48 bucks plus the 600 from this morning.

119
00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:48.770
[inaudible] $650 ish.

120
00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:54.710
Nice to Katie,
how you feel about that day,
you know,

121
00:09:54.711 --> 00:09:56.240
besides the car,
it was pretty good.

122
00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:01.083
<v 1>Okay.</v>

123
00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:04.840
<v 2>No free.
I'm case by</v>

124
00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:10.170
how much money did you make today on that sheet?
Well,
for the most part,

125
00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:14.550
the three hours,
I made 400 and she paid for the studio,

126
00:10:14.551 --> 00:10:19.551
which is $80 we're still deciding moving forward with the image costs.

127
00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:28.753
<v 6>Oh,</v>

128
00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:35.710
<v 7>it's really good.</v>

129
00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:43.910
Tiredness can

130
00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.930
sometimes nine

131
00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:53.870
can keep this from Craig.

132
00:10:57.650 --> 00:10:58.190
Okay.
