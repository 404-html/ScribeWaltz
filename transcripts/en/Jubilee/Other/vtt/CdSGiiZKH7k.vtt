00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:16.820
Ever since I was a kid.

2
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.770
This just this innate sense of alienation that was a part of me all the time and

3
00:00:21.771 --> 00:00:23.360
I don't know where it came from.

4
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.500
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

5
00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.790
<v 1>why I was in the magic was it because I think it was a medium to further</v>

6
00:00:43.791 --> 00:00:45.340
understand reality.

7
00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.350
I wanted to know the truth of how that car disappeared,

8
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.820
how that coin disappeared.

9
00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.960
I was walking through life with this veil of really anxiety,

10
00:01:02.961 --> 00:01:05.870
written thoughts.
What does this person think of me?

11
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.820
What clothes am I going to wear today?

12
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.290
I just had this enlightenment anywhere.

13
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.330
I realize that all of these really mundane worries was completely unnecessary.

14
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.080
There's no physical brick wall till like constrict us from doing what we want,

15
00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.990
you know,

16
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.370
and I realized that it really doesn't matter what that person thinks of me at

17
00:01:28.371 --> 00:01:29.204
all.

18
00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.570
Psychedelics were almost in giant magic trick to me.

19
00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.990
I would see something but under the influence it was actually an illusion of

20
00:01:46.031 --> 00:01:46.864
something else.

21
00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.460
It wasn't enough to figure out how to card trick worked anymore.

22
00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.090
I wanted to see how the trick worked in life.

23
00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.270
I wanted to lift the curtain of reality.

24
00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.020
What is the inner mechanism that strings everything together?

25
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.520
When I would skateboard under these substances,

26
00:02:07.521 --> 00:02:11.870
I felt like part of the earth rolling the wheels on the asphalt.

27
00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.870
Every time I would shuffle cards,
it just felt right.

28
00:02:14.871 --> 00:02:18.020
I felt like a universe orbiting planets in my head.

29
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.590
I felt almost too connected to my surroundings.

30
00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.620
I was reading my ego to the point where I didn't associate with Pierre to the

31
00:02:27.621 --> 00:02:32.090
point where I didn't feel human anymore.
It was just consciousness,

32
00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.940
but when you're living in Orange County at age 19 you can't go around saying

33
00:02:41.141 --> 00:02:42.850
your consciousness,
you know?

34
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.550
I didn't understand how people didn't see how I viewed things and everybody that

35
00:02:49.651 --> 00:02:54.090
I tried to talk to,
it came off really forced and really awkward.

36
00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.870
I would be alone in my room a lot.

37
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.350
Painting is surrounding myself with art,

38
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.810
but I'd be doing all of this stuff by myself.

39
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.510
Depression really started coming in because I didn't relate to anybody around
me,

40
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.870
not my parents,
not my friends.
I didn't have any friends anymore.

41
00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:19.490
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

42
00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:22.830
<v 1>You got to a point where I was longing for human connection at this point.</v>

43
00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.320
I knew what it felt to be the outcast.

44
00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.830
I knew what it felt like to be an alien for a while,

45
00:03:33.831 --> 00:03:37.070
but now it was time to be back on earth.

46
00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:43.980
When you're that far out in space,

47
00:03:43.981 --> 00:03:46.530
it takes a few light years to come back on earth.
You know?

48
00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.570
I had to find out how to be a human being again.

49
00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.070
I was intentionally putting myself back into the illusion.

50
00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.750
I realized that it's not bad to be part of Volusia necessarily.

51
00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.850
The best part about a magic trick is being fooled.
That's where the show is.

52
00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.960
He can't be behind the scenes all the time.
There's no show anymore.

53
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.880
I wanted to be back on stage again.
I want it to be performing with everybody

54
00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.050
are here for a reason.

55
00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:29.140
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

56
00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.730
<v 1>I've been fairly financially comfortable because of my parents,</v>

57
00:05:02.731 --> 00:05:05.370
a good portion of my life,
but no,

58
00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.450
financially we have to get rid of this giant studio that I was completely

59
00:05:09.451 --> 00:05:10.290
blessed with.

60
00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.740
You have to find a new home and we have to find a way to make ends meet and

61
00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:18.323
<v 0>oh no.</v>

62
00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:23.410
<v 1>It really sucks.
Like it's been really somber about it.</v>

63
00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:32.980
Right now I'm just trying to figure out where I belong in human society.

64
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.080
I don't know how to make stuff that makes money.

65
00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.300
I tried to make art that reaches out to a bigger audience at times,
but you know,

66
00:05:45.301 --> 00:05:50.140
that's for everyone else to decide really.
And,

67
00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:53.620
and what I've been struggling with recently is just that all of the material

68
00:05:53.621 --> 00:05:56.800
that I've made throughout the years,
does it mean anything to,

69
00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:08.580
it's really unfortunate,
but I guess eventually the baby has to exit the womb,

70
00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:11.160
right?
The baby has to see the world.

71
00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:22.810
I don't think life is only about happiness anyway,
I think.

72
00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.730
I think life is a lot deeper than that.

73
00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:32.290
It's a lot more important to grow and to be happy.

74
00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.780
No,
I,
I don't know where to go exactly,

75
00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:45.290
but hopefully the universe has a path carved out that I can walk down on.
