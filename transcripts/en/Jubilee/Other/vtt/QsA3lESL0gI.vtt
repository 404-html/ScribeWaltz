1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.680
How about Sam Smith and never it again?

2
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:06.323
Yeah.

3
00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:09.763
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

4
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.960
<v 0>A viral New York Times article featured 36 questions that could supposedly make</v>

5
00:00:14.961 --> 00:00:16.460
any two people falling in love.

6
00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.660
We want it to see what would happen if we ask these questions to two complete

7
00:00:20.661 --> 00:00:22.220
strangers on a blind date.

8
00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.120
My name is Amy and I am super single.

9
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:29.210
My last relationship was a year and a half ago.

10
00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.030
I've been very ready to go back into the dating game.

11
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.600
My name is Joey Jennings and I'm currently single.

12
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.780
I have kind of messed around with the online dating apps.

13
00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:42.650
You kind of get to know them like through the bio and there's,

14
00:00:42.651 --> 00:00:46.940
but you can't really trust that,
you know,
so technically no,

15
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.520
I've never been on a full on blind date like this.

16
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.160
I have no idea what I'm in for,
but accepted with a big hug.

17
00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.580
Hi
Amy.
Nice to meet you too.
I'm Joey.

18
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.210
Hi Joey.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you as well.
Said that twice.

19
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.300
I feel a little on edge,
but like in a good way.
It's not a nervous thing.

20
00:01:14.301 --> 00:01:18.120
It's just like anticipation and like a little bit.
Do you like tea?

21
00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.040
Yes.
Cheers.
Cheers.
For Tea.
I want to do that.
She was tea.

22
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.833
<v 1>Woo.</v>

23
00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.320
<v 0>I have no idea what flavor it is,
but it's tea.
So it's good for the soul.
Um,</v>

24
00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.030
when did you last seen to yourself and to someone else?
Oh Man,

25
00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:39.100
last time I sang to myself was yesterday and the shower,

26
00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.360
I love singing,
like writing my own music,
a good singer.
I'm tone deaf.

27
00:01:43.361 --> 00:01:45.700
I can't carry a tune.
I'll sing something and I'll be like,

28
00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.040
that's so not what it sounded like in my head.

29
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.160
How about Sam Smith and it again and again.
To me,

30
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.730
just your energy and your smile while you're singing it is just,

31
00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:57.840
that's more of a treat to me.

32
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.790
Take one minute and tell your partner your life story as much detail as

33
00:02:02.791 --> 00:02:06.090
possible.
Born and raised in southern California.

34
00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.920
Middle School was pretty rough for me.
I was,

35
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.520
how's it really awkward kid.
Sophomore year I,
um,

36
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.930
started going through some really bad depression and um,

37
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.190
that's something I still deal with today.

38
00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.600
I don't know exactly where it comes from.
There's so many different sources.

39
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.040
I dropped out of high school sophomore year cause it was that bad and I don't

40
00:02:29.041 --> 00:02:33.330
know if you know next models.
Uh,
so this one woman saw me.
It was just like,

41
00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.800
you work for anyone.
I'm just like,
what do you mean?
He's just like,

42
00:02:37.801 --> 00:02:40.800
do you model and how did that play into your depression?

43
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.780
It definitely fed my ego a bunch and I was just like,
okay as a shit,

44
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.910
everyone at school was like,
oh he's living the dream.

45
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.250
Dropped out of high school and becoming a model.

46
00:02:50.251 --> 00:02:53.130
And I got my Instagram going and everyone was like,
oh look at this.
Like no,

47
00:02:53.131 --> 00:02:55.540
I have clinical depression and being chopped out because of the,

48
00:02:55.541 --> 00:02:57.360
can you keep up with the system?
As you can tell,

49
00:02:57.361 --> 00:03:01.480
I'm pretty open about sharing that because I know so many other people have it

50
00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:03.910
and it's not something to be ashamed of at all.

51
00:03:03.911 --> 00:03:07.240
It shouldn't be 19 to where I am now.

52
00:03:07.241 --> 00:03:09.460
I started a surfing business,

53
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.750
so if I can make enough money to support myself,
do things,

54
00:03:13.751 --> 00:03:15.520
I love that success.

55
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.190
I would've never asked the guests that you have like clinical depression and

56
00:03:18.191 --> 00:03:19.660
it's something that you've struggled with now.
Yeah.

57
00:03:19.661 --> 00:03:23.080
Not many people think that at all.
They just say snap out of it.

58
00:03:23.081 --> 00:03:25.390
You got to everything you want.
I think when my mom would say to me,

59
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.550
I was born in the bay,
but I moved here when I was three.

60
00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.580
My mom was the breadwinner and my dad was the homemakers who was the one

61
00:03:30.581 --> 00:03:33.490
braiding my hair,
taking me to school beyond my recitals.

62
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.180
And I actually didn't start seeing my mom or like cultivating relationships with

63
00:03:37.181 --> 00:03:42.181
there until I was like 15 things that you would relate masculinity in this

64
00:03:42.491 --> 00:03:46.570
society.
Like I learned it off of my mom,
like how to negotiate a business deal,

65
00:03:46.571 --> 00:03:49.330
how to present yourself.
And then my dad was the one who was like,

66
00:03:49.331 --> 00:03:52.660
if I said I was like fat,
he'd be like,
hey man,
you're so like,
you're fine.

67
00:03:52.661 --> 00:03:56.620
You don't need a workout.
And my mom would be like,
go work out.
You're pathetic.

68
00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.090
You're a loser with her.
She's really unhappy.
So I think seeing that growing up,

69
00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.710
I was like,
there's something missing.

70
00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.840
If I have to trade all my time to make money,

71
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.360
where do I have the time to enjoy that money?
Exactly.

72
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.180
As soon as I graduated from Ucla,
my mom was like,

73
00:04:10.181 --> 00:04:13.300
you know you're making like x amount of money.
Like go follow your dream.

74
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.400
I support you because I heard it from her.
I was like,
yeah,

75
00:04:18.401 --> 00:04:21.430
of course.
Because like everything I did was to impress her.

76
00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:24.340
What would constitute a perfect day for you?
I'm like,

77
00:04:24.341 --> 00:04:28.000
perfect day would be sleeping in,
eating something very healthy,

78
00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:29.980
but a delicious,

79
00:04:29.981 --> 00:04:34.420
so like in a cycle and then probably spending it in like nature can be simple.

80
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:35.280
What about you?

81
00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.280
I would wake up at five 30 in the morning and goes down surfing after five 30 to

82
00:04:40.601 --> 00:04:45.601
seven 30 I'd go snowboarding and after that if I could at night I'd go

83
00:04:46.091 --> 00:04:49.270
skydiving.
What are you be trained by the end of the day though?

84
00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.490
I feel like you're like extreme,
extreme,
extreme.
I'm getting energy from it.

85
00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.890
Bounces it,
man.
What is your most terrible memory?
It's extreme.

86
00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:05.430
I basically got expelled for making them my space of a teacher by six was just a

87
00:05:05.771 --> 00:05:08.770
new thing.
And you know,
people were scared of like crisis,

88
00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.590
like killers and stuff like that.
And the Internet was a very scary thing.

89
00:05:11.591 --> 00:05:15.790
It was still dial up.
They like purposely like kind of teasing or no,

90
00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.820
I actually made her a gap model and then,

91
00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.970
and I'm literally like,
like straight a student.
Like I'm on the honor roll.

92
00:05:24.971 --> 00:05:26.500
And then I got excelled and from a small town,

93
00:05:26.501 --> 00:05:29.770
so literally everyone knew about it and I spent every single day crying and then

94
00:05:29.771 --> 00:05:33.220
my dad came into the room and he just started sobbing with me on the bed.

95
00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.720
I was the sounds like a sweetheart.
Oh yeah he is.
But like just that moment,

96
00:05:37.721 --> 00:05:39.940
I never want to feel that way every year of my life.

97
00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.840
For me it's gotta be a scooter accident.

98
00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.820
I was seven years old.
You know how it has those puffy handles?
Everything.
Okay.

99
00:05:48.821 --> 00:05:52.630
Well one of them was off.
One of the screws of the front front wheels fell off.

100
00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:58.020
I just nosedive face planted and at the same time the scooter handle drove up my

101
00:05:59.001 --> 00:06:03.500
chin and through my mouth it bypass the bones and just went.

102
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:04.790
It was awful,

103
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.260
but I was in so much shock that I didn't even realize it.

104
00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.000
I didn't feel the pain.
I was just like,

105
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.560
I was just dizzy and like wondering what just happened.

106
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.890
There was blood all over the driveway.
I was bleeding out.

107
00:06:18.891 --> 00:06:23.690
Just my whole face was being drained.
Was crazy.
Like out of all of that,

108
00:06:23.691 --> 00:06:26.450
that's the score that you got?
Yeah,
I think it's quite small.

109
00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:29.210
It's shrunk but it was like that big,
oh my,
you know,

110
00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.600
so that was more physically painful,
emotionally painful,

111
00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:37.220
alternate sharing something you consider a positive characteristic of your

112
00:06:37.221 --> 00:06:42.221
partner right off the bat you have a beautiful smile and you're very positive

113
00:06:42.411 --> 00:06:44.000
and you're very outgoing.

114
00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:48.020
I think you're a very positive person and I think I said earlier like I would've

115
00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:52.430
never guessed that someone like you was like dealing with clinical depression

116
00:06:52.431 --> 00:06:55.310
and I think that shows a lot about how strong you are too.

117
00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.730
I think it also fearless.
That's what I've noticed.
When I see you,
I'm like,

118
00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.890
this guy is fearless.
Like your like your perfect day.

119
00:07:01.891 --> 00:07:03.580
It has to do with snowboarding,

120
00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:08.540
like surfing or you just seem very overall positive and you're like a very

121
00:07:08.541 --> 00:07:11.710
resilient person.
I can tell.
Thank you.
Yeah,
that means a lot.

122
00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:17.930
Where'd you go on a second date with your partner?
Yes,

123
00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:21.470
I would say yeah.
Interesting person.
Yeah,
for sure.

124
00:07:21.471 --> 00:07:24.800
I feel like you had a lot to talk about.
I can definitely see us hanging out.

125
00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:28.760
So talking more about our personal lives.
Yes,
I will.

126
00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:32.390
For free to no,
I live.
Wow.
