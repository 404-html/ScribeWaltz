00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.210
Sheriff's struggle that you've experienced in life,
that involves your body.

2
00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.420
Does every day count?
Um,

3
00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.490
my name is April Mitchell.
All right.

4
00:00:27.491 --> 00:00:29.680
Take off your room and look at your body in the mirror.

5
00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.080
Describe the feelings and thoughts that you have.

6
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.700
Well,
I see a body that I've lived in for a whole 27 years.

7
00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.280
Uh,
sometimes I've hated it,
but I've grown to be a pretty okay with it.

8
00:00:50.281 --> 00:00:54.570
Now.
My name is [inaudible] Layla.
I'm 24 years old.

9
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.333
<v 2>Oh.</v>

10
00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.000
<v 0>I waver between loving my body and being extremely ashamed of it.</v>

11
00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.120
So oftentimes when I look in the mirror,

12
00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.670
I don't know how I'm gonna feel after or how my day's going to go.
Um,

13
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.080
so it feels like a Russian roulette and sometimes it's scary.
Um,

14
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.770
so I guess sometimes I am afraid of my body.
My Name Is Giang Park.
I'm 25

15
00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:20.623
<v 3>years old.</v>

16
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.980
It's just a lot of
robustness.
I see.

17
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.690
Um,
these tan lines I can fix,
but like

18
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.370
this stuff,
I can't,
my name is Chris.

19
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.360
I'm 31 and my eyes like assist,

20
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.990
not whenever I want it to be.
So it's a work in progress.

21
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.130
My name is Paige.
I am 24 years old.

22
00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.700
I feel bold.
I feel strong.

23
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.070
I feel proud to be blessed with such a beautiful body,

24
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.990
beautiful skin,
and so much,

25
00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:04.513
so much light.

26
00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.100
<v 0>All right.
So what makes your skin unique?</v>

27
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.950
I guess I like that I can tan easily.

28
00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.100
<v 2>Um,
I don't know.</v>

29
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.170
<v 0>Would you like to go first?
How did it go from there?</v>

30
00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.490
Um,
so my skin,
um,

31
00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.720
I have something called middle I go.

32
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:36.000
So it's a condition where you lose patches of the pigment,
of your skin.

33
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:37.183
Um,

34
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.200
my skin is unique because I'm the only one that has these exact colors and these

35
00:02:43.231 --> 00:02:45.360
exact places with these exact pictures.

36
00:02:45.361 --> 00:02:49.200
Like I can find little hearts and little things up in my slides.
Yeah.

37
00:02:49.201 --> 00:02:51.750
I used to have one of my finger and then it kind of shifted.

38
00:02:51.751 --> 00:02:55.680
I had a snowman on my back and my mom like painted a little top hat,

39
00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.190
like a little carrot nose.
I think I'm pretty happy in my skin.
Um,

40
00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.060
I've grown to love the little things that make me me and made me different.

41
00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.300
It doesn't look like,
you know,
every supermodel in every magazine,

42
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.440
every actors on TV.
It's a little more artistic than,

43
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.760
than some with the different coloring.
But yeah,
I think that my body's beautiful.

44
00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.620
<v 3>Sure.
A struggle that you've experienced in life that involves your body.
Who</v>

45
00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.950
<v 0>uh,
does every day cow?
Um,</v>

46
00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:33.550
I would say I struggled a lot dealing with my skin color because it was really

47
00:03:35.421 --> 00:03:39.440
hard for me to fit in.
Like I was,
I was,
um,
considered dark,

48
00:03:39.441 --> 00:03:43.460
but I'm not African,
so all the Africans look at me like,
oh,
you're not African.

49
00:03:43.461 --> 00:03:45.790
I'm like,
no.
Then all the black people look at me like,
Oh,
you,

50
00:03:45.791 --> 00:03:47.930
you have to be African.
I'm like,
no.

51
00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:53.140
It's kind of hard dealing with people's perception of me prior to meeting near

52
00:03:53.211 --> 00:03:57.500
the assumptions they make about me and I've had to experience that

53
00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.200
educationally,
professionally,
everywhere I go.

54
00:04:00.201 --> 00:04:03.990
So now it's kind of like a badge of honor,
kind of bashing stereotypes.
Right.

55
00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.660
<v 3>You where I go.
What about yourself?
What,
um,</v>

56
00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.280
a lot of stuff like going up like health wise,

57
00:04:09.281 --> 00:04:14.281
I like puberty and stuff or like I had like pretty bad acne from like middle

58
00:04:15.481 --> 00:04:16.380
school until like,

59
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.450
like middle of college and then I got some medicine for it and it cleared up

60
00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.500
really quickly.
The insecurity was always there.

61
00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.670
Still it doesn't go away very quickly.
Um,

62
00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.380
so I think I carried myself kind of the same but like it wasn't until like a

63
00:04:34.381 --> 00:04:38.100
little bit later when like I gained more confidence in myself after the fact.

64
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.480
<v 5>I like that.
Nice.
You know,</v>

65
00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:47.510
I tried to like get the ideal body that's like by the media standards.

66
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.390
So that's,
that's just not where I want it to be.

67
00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:57.100
When you're bombarded by like so many like different like pictures of like,

68
00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.200
you know,
nice bodies and stuff that's like kind of like what you strive towards.

69
00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:05.210
You got to put the work in,
but you know,
that's

70
00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.110
<v 4>Hawaii I guess idealize it.</v>

71
00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:13.530
<v 3>I was broke the hall</v>

72
00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:15.570
<v 0>sad.
Okay.</v>

73
00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.890
Do you struggle with any aspects of your skin?

74
00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:25.140
So I grew up with really like bumpy skin and I don't really know what it is.

75
00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:26.340
But um,

76
00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.940
as a child I've been called like chicken skin and all that because people will

77
00:05:29.941 --> 00:05:33.500
go like,
what's that on your arm?
Like your legs?
And I'm like,
I don't know.

78
00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:37.350
I was just born with it,
you know,
kind of bugs me a little bit,

79
00:05:37.351 --> 00:05:40.620
but not so much anymore.
I kind of have like a little,
yeah,

80
00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:45.040
bit of bumps on my skin too,
just like on my forearms.
And then,
um,

81
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:48.230
I struggle really hard with,
um,

82
00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:52.360
I take chemo every day and like that causes a rash.

83
00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:57.420
And so struggling with having to take something cause I need to live and then on

84
00:05:59.031 --> 00:06:03.170
top of it it causes me to look very different.
Um,

85
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:08.660
and have people make fun of me cause they don't know like what I'm battling

86
00:06:08.661 --> 00:06:13.100
against.
Um,
and then also just like,
it affects how we perceive ourselves too.

87
00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:14.880
You know,
like when it looks,

88
00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:18.770
when you feel like you look different than what's normal or the standard.

89
00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.200
A lot of people when they first look at me,

90
00:06:21.201 --> 00:06:26.060
they would never assume that right now I'm battling cancer and um,

91
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:30.860
and not just like any type,
it's just like a really advanced stage.

92
00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:36.490
Learning to like love my body through living with something that wants to kill

93
00:06:36.591 --> 00:06:39.620
me inside of it is,
it is a huge dichotomy.

94
00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:41.750
How can I love me?

95
00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:46.990
I love my body when I'm housing something that is so hell bent on killing me so

96
00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.790
hard.
It's hard.

97
00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.380
What is your favorite activity to do that involves your body?

98
00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:01.910
<v 2>Okay.</v>

99
00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:04.070
<v 0>I like to get tattoos on my body.</v>

100
00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:08.030
I think it's a way to express myself artistically and it's there permanently.

101
00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:10.820
So I just feel like it's another way to celebrate my body,
my art,

102
00:07:10.821 --> 00:07:14.210
my creativity through tattoos.
So I love that process.

103
00:07:14.211 --> 00:07:18.440
I get to go through that pain,
the joy,
the whole process.
I love that.

104
00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:23.650
I feel that I started getting tatted as a way after I was dealing with self

105
00:07:23.751 --> 00:07:26.990
injury for awhile.
Um,
I have a lot of scarf vacation,

106
00:07:26.991 --> 00:07:29.180
so I kind of got it as a way to cover it up,

107
00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:33.530
but now it's just become kind of a means of me,
um,
to really express myself.

108
00:07:33.531 --> 00:07:34.490
Kind of like what you were saying,

109
00:07:34.491 --> 00:07:37.680
like you can kind of completely get to know me just based off of looking at my

110
00:07:37.681 --> 00:07:42.320
tats and asking me questions.
Um,
and so I got my chest Tattoo,

111
00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:43.513
um,

112
00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:47.240
after I got diagnosed with cancer and I kind of went against my doctor's orders

113
00:07:47.241 --> 00:07:50.750
and got it anyways,
um,
because I have blood cancer,
so that's really,

114
00:07:50.751 --> 00:07:53.060
you should not be doing that.
But um,

115
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:57.650
it pretty much is representative of things that have been important in my tribe.

116
00:07:57.651 --> 00:08:00.710
And so I have a snake and arrowhead and it's in the shape of it.

117
00:08:00.711 --> 00:08:04.610
The Congo Cosmogram,
which is African cosmology.
That's beautiful.

118
00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:10.030
One of my favorite tattoos is for my grandmother.

119
00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:15.320
It's a clock and it has orchids with her initials and it has one of my favorite

120
00:08:15.321 --> 00:08:19.400
quotes.
In the end,
everything will be okay if it's not okay,
it's not the end.

121
00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:21.470
And it's kind of like a reminder to me,

122
00:08:21.471 --> 00:08:24.740
like everything might seem like it's crumbling around me,

123
00:08:24.741 --> 00:08:27.800
but I know at the end of the day I will be settled.

124
00:08:27.801 --> 00:08:31.430
I will be okay as long as I understand it's not the end.

125
00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:35.690
Like my storm is not the end of what I'm going through now.

126
00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:41.210
My skin has taught me so much about myself and so much about what I can handle.

127
00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:46.100
It's taught me how to be confident and how to walk into a room and command

128
00:08:46.101 --> 00:08:46.934
attention.

129
00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:50.630
I'm realizing and I'm learning every day that self love is the best love.

130
00:08:50.631 --> 00:08:55.230
So I'm learning to accept me for what I have.
When I wake up in the morning,

131
00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:58.950
I always tell myself,
you're beautiful,
you're kind,
you're all these things.

132
00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:03.660
So there's absolutely nothing I would change about my body because I know that I

133
00:09:03.661 --> 00:09:05.370
was made perfectly imperfect.

134
00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:10.053
<v 2>Oh,</v>

135
00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:17.260
<v 3>are you afraid of aging?
Why not really?</v>

136
00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:22.600
I try to be present and conscious and stay here.
Yeah.

137
00:09:22.601 --> 00:09:25.240
So like why waste energy anyway?
Yeah.
Why waste energy?

138
00:09:25.241 --> 00:09:28.510
It's going to happen to everybody.
I mean,

139
00:09:28.511 --> 00:09:31.660
whatever happens when you get older happens.

140
00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:35.260
I have a similar mindset where it's like,
yeah,
it's just,
things will just happen.

141
00:09:35.261 --> 00:09:39.400
Everyone has their own timeline.
Do you want to get like really old or like,

142
00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:43.000
do I want to get really old?
I feel like,
I don't know.
With our technology now,

143
00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:46.590
you know,
anything can happen.
I think people are like

144
00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:50.520
thinking about living forever.
Right?

145
00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:52.210
<v 2>Oh,
okay.</v>

146
00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:56.820
<v 3>That's all.
It was too far.
Know that there's been a lot of like,</v>

147
00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:59.790
you know,
like love your body campaigns and stuff like that,

148
00:09:59.791 --> 00:10:02.580
which kind of helps a little bit.
I tried to love my body.

149
00:10:02.581 --> 00:10:04.740
I know that it's the only one I have.

150
00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:08.550
So I look at myself and I just,

151
00:10:08.551 --> 00:10:13.080
I just gotta look at myself and I go like,
this is it.

152
00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:14.083
You know?

153
00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:17.880
I think the only thing I like about my body is these little happy trails right

154
00:10:17.881 --> 00:10:19.920
here.
I don't know why I think it's cute.

155
00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:23.743
Okay.

156
00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:25.300
<v 0>I'll ask you the question.</v>

157
00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:31.090
Describe a physical trait of the person across from you that you admire.

158
00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:36.160
Ooh.
Called traits.
I think just your smile.

159
00:10:36.161 --> 00:10:36.941
If that counts.

160
00:10:36.941 --> 00:10:41.941
You seem so confident and happy and you can just exude that confidence,

161
00:10:42.611 --> 00:10:46.570
which I,
I love PBS of.
Yes.
Thank you.

162
00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:50.470
A physical trait.
I would say that you have that I admire one a top.

163
00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:52.420
You're gorgeous.
Let's get that out the way.

164
00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:57.490
But I would say the grace you have,
and I'm only catching a glimpse of you,
but I,

165
00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:01.120
I would say the grace you have and the confidence you have in expressing your

166
00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:04.210
vitiligo and sharing this information,
I think that's beautiful.

167
00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:07.900
So I would probably say your grace.
You're very,
you're very regal and elegant.

168
00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:09.880
Yeah.
I love that.
Of course.
So Nice.

169
00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:14.200
I think it's only natural as human beings to want to change things about

170
00:11:14.201 --> 00:11:16.930
ourselves.
I think that when I was younger,

171
00:11:16.931 --> 00:11:20.380
there were definitely things that I would much rather change about myself than

172
00:11:20.381 --> 00:11:21.214
there are now.

173
00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:31.340
I think my body reflects me in the sense that

174
00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:36.930
<v 2>it has a will to live.
It's resilient,</v>

175
00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:38.370
just like my spirit.
