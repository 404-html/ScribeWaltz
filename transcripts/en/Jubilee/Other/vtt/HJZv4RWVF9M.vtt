00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.360
Oh my God.
You know what's crazy?
This is it.

2
00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:06.330
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

3
00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:13.420
<v 2>a viral New York Times article featured 36 questions that could supposedly make</v>

4
00:00:13.421 --> 00:00:14.920
any two people falling in love.

5
00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.090
We want it to see what would happen if we ask these questions to two complete

6
00:00:19.091 --> 00:00:20.710
strangers on a blind date.

7
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.300
<v 3>Hi,
my name is Jaylene Dawkins and I'm single.</v>

8
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.340
I've actually never been in a relationship.
Yes.
So I've been on dates,

9
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.850
but I've never had a boyfriend,
so I'm like low key single my whole life,

10
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.420
but I'm 21 so it's not crazy.
I think

11
00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.050
<v 0>my name is Mickey Miller and I am single as a Pringle.
Are you nervous?</v>

12
00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.000
You know,
more so than I thought I would a little bit,

13
00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:47.920
but I'm good on dates this year.

14
00:00:47.921 --> 00:00:51.640
I've given a lot of attention to myself and haven't really made myself
available,

15
00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:53.860
but I think,
uh,
I think I'm good.
I think I'm ready.

16
00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.920
<v 1>Hmm.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Hmm.</v>

17
00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.610
<v 3>Hello.
How are you?
Good.
How are you?
Well,</v>

18
00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.780
what's your name?
Jaylee.
Jaylee.
Mikey team.
Nice to meet.
Yeah,

19
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.910
<v 0>it's like a long Hollywood suspended.</v>

20
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.410
<v 3>Well,
waiting for me or like,
yeah.</v>

21
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:23.740
Do I grab a card?

22
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.910
<v 0>Well I think the tea for two that warrants t I so,</v>

23
00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.180
oh it's really good team ready I bank.
Um,

24
00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.830
if you could wake up tomorrow having gained one quality or ability,

25
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.933
what would it be?

26
00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.290
<v 3>Is it weird that I thought of a superpower first?</v>

27
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:52.730
I would love to tell apart because I commute every day to school and then also I

28
00:01:52.981 --> 00:01:55.970
really want to travel.
Something like that would just be amazing.

29
00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.130
<v 0>Yeah.
Are there limitations or teleporting parameters you have to stay with it?</v>

30
00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.650
Why put limits on teleportation?

31
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.730
<v 3>Okay.
One Quality</v>

32
00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.800
<v 0>I'll go sappy cause that's like kind of a savvy person.
Okay.
Um,</v>

33
00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.950
I think like having the utmost like empathy and having kind of like um,

34
00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.800
unconditional positive regard for people and myself,

35
00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:24.693
honestly,

36
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.400
<v 3>take one minute and tell your partner your life story as much detail as
possible.</v>

37
00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.120
<v 0>Jeez.
Grew up super silly jock.
Yeah.</v>

38
00:02:37.121 --> 00:02:41.140
It didn't really start questioning myself until I lost a lot of people in my

39
00:02:41.141 --> 00:02:44.980
life really,
really quickly.
And they were all under the age of like 50.

40
00:02:44.981 --> 00:02:47.470
I'm talking like seven people probably.
Yeah.

41
00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.380
And then it wasn't until then that I started to really question things started

42
00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.960
experimenting more moves here.
Life goes fast.
Is that a minute

43
00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.050
<v 3>you're like,
that's it.
That's last.
Yeah.
Here.
Um,</v>

44
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.830
ever since I was a kid I wanted to have my own business.

45
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.800
I was kind of trying to figure out what that was when I was growing up.

46
00:03:08.801 --> 00:03:11.820
First I wanted to be a chef and I was like,
yeah,

47
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.870
I was obsessed with Gordon Ramsay.

48
00:03:13.871 --> 00:03:16.930
Still am one is restaurants really golden.

49
00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:21.700
It's my favorite person ever.
All right.
And then I dunno,
I have,

50
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.750
I wanted to go into accounting,
which was completely different.

51
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.250
I wanted to have a good look at a dog daycare and then I was like,
you know what?

52
00:03:30.251 --> 00:03:33.850
I really love fashion.
And then that was,
but this was like,

53
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.310
I figured that out when I was 10.
So then I'm like,
okay,

54
00:03:36.311 --> 00:03:40.450
that's what I'm going for.
I'm super passionate about a lot of things.

55
00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.290
Yeah.
I think that opens up the mind.

56
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.530
What is your most terrible memory growing up?

57
00:03:47.531 --> 00:03:51.760
I was not close to my sister and then she had to get surgery.

58
00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.210
I Dunno like when this happened when I was really young too,

59
00:03:55.211 --> 00:03:57.070
so no one was telling me anything.

60
00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.190
When you go home and someone who was there all the time because you're in close

61
00:04:00.191 --> 00:04:04.720
quarters like myth thing because nobody wanted to let you know.
I mean,
yeah,

62
00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.050
but a lot of a lot of things got up,
went wrong,

63
00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.320
but luckily it went right.
No,

64
00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.050
it was weird because I was like,
I hate my sister.

65
00:04:14.051 --> 00:04:18.350
But then she was gone and I was like,
I kind of love my,
yeah,

66
00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:19.840
terrible memory.

67
00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.700
<v 0>I mentioned I lost a whole bunch of people in a short amount of time.</v>

68
00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.740
The eerie thing is they were all like getting the phone calls about them.

69
00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.090
They were all the same feeling where like my mom would call me.

70
00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.120
It was always my mom and I would pick up and it's not thing that I had a feeling

71
00:04:38.371 --> 00:04:42.330
before answering it,
but as soon as you like answer the phone,

72
00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.680
you could feel her on the other line and then like every time it sucks.

73
00:04:46.681 --> 00:04:49.050
I don't want to cry in front of everybody because it'd be weird.

74
00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.480
But like you here,
my mom would be crying and it happened over and over and over.

75
00:04:54.481 --> 00:04:59.040
In the span of a couple of years,
I have a tattoo from like my,

76
00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.450
my best friend growing up,
she was basically my sister,
um,

77
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.360
and lost her in a car accident.

78
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.430
She was at a party not drinking and came home,

79
00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:12.301
wasn't driving.

80
00:05:12.301 --> 00:05:16.560
The person that was driving wasn't drinking and it was just like snowy

81
00:05:16.561 --> 00:05:20.190
Pennsylvania,
dark roads,
her side hit a tree and we lost her.

82
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.660
Like even thinking about it,
you just like have that feeling and gut.
Yeah.

83
00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:27.630
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
Um,
yeah,
that's gotta be the worst one.

84
00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.900
<v 3>All right,
let's see.
Okay,
complete this sentence.</v>

85
00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:36.100
I wish I had someone with whom I could share.
Oh my God.

86
00:05:36.101 --> 00:05:39.700
You know what's crazy?
This is it.
Like,

87
00:05:39.701 --> 00:05:43.750
I love tea and I'm not a coffee person and I'm like,

88
00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.030
I literally finally,
they

89
00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:52.030
love coffee more,
but I love tea.
I love tea.
And I'm like,

90
00:05:52.031 --> 00:05:54.290
even if you don't like it,
you still have to be here and drink.

91
00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.130
What would would,
what do I want to share

92
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.920
<v 0>something with traveling for sure.</v>

93
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:05.150
There's a huge part of me that wants to travel by myself,
but I think,
you know,

94
00:06:05.151 --> 00:06:08.600
falling in love with somebody or whatever and then traveling and having that

95
00:06:08.601 --> 00:06:09.350
experience,

96
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:13.590
I think those experiences are probably in comparable to anything else.
Yeah.

97
00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:19.130
What is true love?
Wow.
Uh,

98
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.920
somebody that's like honest with you and that's not going to just tell you

99
00:06:24.921 --> 00:06:28.660
whatever you want.
I'll never have a relationship that's like,
you know,

100
00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:33.700
passive in any way and I'll never go in kind of thinking that I want you to make

101
00:06:33.711 --> 00:06:37.040
me whole cause I think that's a mistake that a lot of people make.

102
00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.600
They go into it thinking that they need when they want to fill a void.

103
00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.400
<v 3>Great.
I agree with that.
Um,
I was going to say like,
I was like,</v>

104
00:06:44.401 --> 00:06:45.750
it's kind of like friendships too.

105
00:06:45.751 --> 00:06:48.750
Like I know a lot of people who weren't friends with the person that they're

106
00:06:48.751 --> 00:06:51.720
with,
they just went straight into dating,
which I'm like,
how does that happen?

107
00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:54.420
I would want to get to know the person as a friend or like a best friend and

108
00:06:54.421 --> 00:06:56.450
everyone's like friends zone.
No,

109
00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:59.490
but it's like if your partner is not your best friend,
like what are you doing?

110
00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.970
You have to be able to go through all these things with someone to like grow and

111
00:07:02.971 --> 00:07:05.490
like love them for who they are,
you know,

112
00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:09.420
<v 0>alternate sharing something you consider a positive characteristic of your</v>

113
00:07:09.421 --> 00:07:12.770
partner.
Share a total of three items.
Ooh,

114
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:18.230
<v 3>okay,
good.
Migos.
Um,</v>

115
00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:20.810
your openness.
I'm not going to do

116
00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:25.310
<v 0>anything physical cause I feel like that's a cop out and it's already,
you know,</v>

117
00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:26.393
we already know,

118
00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:29.020
<v 3>uh,
but</v>

119
00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:33.820
<v 0>super open,
which I admire.
The whole passion thing is really important.</v>

120
00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:36.460
Also admire what's a good three.

121
00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:39.790
I'm sure really trying not to go physical and I guess it kind of up,

122
00:07:39.791 --> 00:07:43.060
but you do have some nice smile.
I'll cut that.
Oh,
I'll tab off.

123
00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:49.140
<v 3>Yeah.
I'll take it though.
I'm going to steal yours.
I appreciate your openness.</v>

124
00:07:49.141 --> 00:07:50.520
I think that's so important.

125
00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:55.560
You're like really like humble and you could talk about things that you,

126
00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:59.610
what do you really want to talk to with a stranger,
you know?
Yeah.
That's not me.

127
00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:01.970
I don't know if that's a good thing.

128
00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:07.350
You're really funny like that's and that's awesome because it's nice to meet

129
00:08:07.351 --> 00:08:09.380
someone with a sense of humor.
Yeah.

130
00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:14.870
<v 0>Last question.
You Ready?
Okay.
Yes.
These things.</v>

131
00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:19.770
What'd you go on a second date with your partner?
Ooh,
AH,

132
00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:20.863
yeah.

133
00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:26.850
<v 3>Short and sweet.
I like it.
I appreciate it.
And we don't need a second date.</v>

134
00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:30.570
Just marriage,
right?
I guess.
Yeah.
See that's what I'm saying.

135
00:08:30.571 --> 00:08:34.310
Riding the line between like what's funny and like the,
that was low Mike,

136
00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.970
so I got,
no,
I should probably not do.
Then

137
00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:46.990
we'll hold the hands and how to do this.

138
00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:51.300
Hey guys,
Jason here.

139
00:08:51.301 --> 00:08:54.030
Thank you so much for watching another episode of tea for two.

140
00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:55.980
We hope you enjoyed.
We've been a really

141
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:59.910
<v 4>exciting special announced.
