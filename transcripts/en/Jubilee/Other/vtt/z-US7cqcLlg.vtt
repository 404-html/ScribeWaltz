1
00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:05.120
I hate you.
Can you hear me?
That's terrible.
Sorry.

2
00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:16.183
Okay.

3
00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.560
<v 3>Uh,
my name is Laila Barrett.
Danielle.
My name is Joanna and Murphy</v>

4
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.990
<v 2>and we've been dating how many years?
Three years.</v>

5
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.530
<v 3>I'm on three arms.</v>

6
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.630
<v 2>So we met on online</v>

7
00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.490
<v 1>dating.
Okay.
Stupid.
I like to call it.</v>

8
00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.010
So we had arranged to meet at this bar and then I remember she walked in looking

9
00:00:48.011 --> 00:00:51.790
at my phone and she kind of stood in front of me.
So I was like,

10
00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.870
my eyes went from her feet all the way up to her face and I was like,
ah,

11
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.150
<v 3>she's not going to hear anything because she's totally done.</v>

12
00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:13.410
The first time I saw Layla where you were at a bar and we'd been texting each

13
00:01:15.191 --> 00:01:16.330
other back and forth.

14
00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.130
I saw her immediately sitting there with her looking at her phone.

15
00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.290
So I thought,
okay,
I'm going to,
you know,
blow her away.
Maybe.
We'll see.

16
00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.180
So I walked up and I stood in front of her,

17
00:01:31.181 --> 00:01:35.470
so I knew that she would have to look for my feet up to my face.

18
00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.700
And um,
your mouth is kind of a nice moment.

19
00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:47.050
I was married before and I left the marriage because I knew that I wanted to be

20
00:01:49.191 --> 00:01:51.660
with a woman.
And um,

21
00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.370
it took me like four years before I started dating anyone,

22
00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:57.410
especially with a kid,
you know,

23
00:01:57.411 --> 00:02:01.940
really wanted to be sensitive to my daughter's experience and that it was just

24
00:02:01.941 --> 00:02:04.550
an adjustment.
So she is,

25
00:02:04.551 --> 00:02:08.000
she in Laila have a really good relationship.

26
00:02:08.001 --> 00:02:13.001
It's kind of like tourist kind of the one that's raining Laylas behavior in some

27
00:02:13.571 --> 00:02:16.670
times.
And Toro will be like Layla,

28
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.580
<v 1>I think when I met her daughter,
that's,</v>

29
00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.770
that was a big turning point for me.
And I was like,

30
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.220
if I'm serious about this woman,
I have to be a real adult about,

31
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.160
about the situation because there's a child involved.

32
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.980
I think that she likes that I have a little fire under my belly kind of thing

33
00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.550
and she likes my humor to,
um,

34
00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.680
my friends tell me that I'm a lot of girl and she knows how to handle me.

35
00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:46.630
<v 2>MMM.</v>

36
00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.200
<v 3>She's confident.
She's got a little bit of a swagger.</v>

37
00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.810
She's got a really good sense of humor

38
00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.660
and she's got great tip.

39
00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.830
I don't know if that's about her as a person.
That

40
00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.290
<v 1>as far as my personality,</v>

41
00:03:04.291 --> 00:03:08.040
I'm much more saltier than she is reactive.

42
00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.350
Then she is.
Join is very calm.
She doesn't get,

43
00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.690
she doesn't feed into that emotional,
you know,

44
00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.140
hurricanes so to speak.
And in return that that makes me calm down to,

45
00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.810
not that I'm a raging lunatic or anything.

46
00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.860
I can get myself in a tizzy real fast.
There was

47
00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.980
<v 3>time at a coffee shop and her t wasn't hot and they wouldn't Redo so they were</v>

48
00:03:36.531 --> 00:03:40.520
being shitty and she was pissed,

49
00:03:40.521 --> 00:03:45.521
but she was holding it back because Touro was with us and Layla will not do

50
00:03:46.671 --> 00:03:51.671
anything in front of Torah that or make tour think you know anything less of her

51
00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:56.180
not respect her.

52
00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.410
<v 1>He cut the awesome hot.
Oh yes.</v>

53
00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.200
If you'd like us to.
If you like a hot a cup of tea,

54
00:04:08.201 --> 00:04:12.630
you'd have to buy another one.
I said,
oh wow.

55
00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.110
I was like,
what?
The red is like

56
00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.040
you said that to the wrong girl.

57
00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.650
These guys were waiting outside.
I said,
I forgot something.
That's it.
Go ahead.

58
00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.410
You know,
beat you up the street up,

59
00:04:31.411 --> 00:04:35.590
reach up the road or wait for me outside of whatever.
I went in there,

60
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:39.010
I took every cup of coffee I could find,

61
00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.160
just kind of picked it up and just started it

62
00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.020
actually closing my eyes and like chanting at the same time,

63
00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:52.753
<v 3>Leland,</v>

64
00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.620
and we were kind of teasing it out a little bit before that happened

65
00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.570
<v 1>because I was going to on a trip to New York and I was just,</v>

66
00:05:03.571 --> 00:05:08.270
I'm scared to fly.
It's getting to fly.
And I was really,
I really did.

67
00:05:08.271 --> 00:05:11.540
I was really falling in love with Joanna and I was like,
yeah,

68
00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.030
I'm going to just tell her I,
you know,
before I left,

69
00:05:14.031 --> 00:05:18.410
it was very organic and just be like,
listen,
I love you and help you back.

70
00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.820
I didn't,
no,
I didn't.
She's not,
she's a funny person,

71
00:05:25.821 --> 00:05:29.600
but she's really not about actually a serious person.

72
00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.890
She's going to be so disappointed in me when she realizes that I can't tell a

73
00:05:33.891 --> 00:05:36.310
funny story about her.
Okay.

74
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:42.690
<v 3>So I'm sitting in front of my big IMAC computer screen,</v>

75
00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.570
video conferencing with my boss.

76
00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.850
<v 1>Obviously
I'm an idiot.</v>

77
00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.400
I Wa I was like,
Oh,
let me make one of myself some tea.

78
00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:57.920
<v 3>All of a sudden I see me,</v>

79
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:03.340
Layla walking by and only underwear and Joanna is so humiliated or she can do,

80
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:10.000
I head in her hands and I was like,
oh my God,

81
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.870
just say I am so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

82
00:06:13.871 --> 00:06:15.850
Like 50 times a box.

83
00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:21.010
So the next part of the dilemma was like I needed to get back into the bedroom

84
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:25.420
low being Layla thinks she's going to be stealth,
which she is.
So not

85
00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:30.620
like,
how are we going to deal with that?
So I kind of basic,

86
00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:35.630
you've got in craft position and stuff like walk across and all of a sudden I

87
00:06:37.361 --> 00:06:42.361
see at the bottom of the screen I could see my head like bobbing up and down on

88
00:06:44.441 --> 00:06:48.790
this screen that's I was going to cross.
I mean it was so humiliating,

89
00:06:48.791 --> 00:06:52.120
but it was kind of,
it's kind of funny and pretty.
It's at the same time.

90
00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.690
<v 1>Um,
I,</v>

91
00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:02.000
I chose you because you are the most amazing,

92
00:07:02.001 --> 00:07:06.620
beautiful woman in the world and you

93
00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.450
have changed me completely.

94
00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:16.660
I really feel that I am like better still a little bit because of you.

95
00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:21.860
You're so kind and loving.
I am so lucky.

96
00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:26.000
I really am honored and grateful to be apart.

97
00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:30.690
You are the heartbeat of our family.
I love you.
And I just,

98
00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:34.520
it just might be so devastated if we went together.

99
00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:37.550
That's not even an option.

100
00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:41.613
<v 2>Okay.</v>

101
00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:45.200
<v 0>I have not</v>

102
00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:50.300
<v 3>told her enough how much I love her and how much she means to me,</v>

103
00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.680
even though she has no idea

104
00:07:55.500 --> 00:08:00.500
and I can't imagine a life without her.

105
00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:05.160
She keeps me honest.

106
00:08:05.161 --> 00:08:10.161
She takes the time to really learn about me and know me and you know,

107
00:08:15.871 --> 00:08:20.871
even though she can be wretched with people,

108
00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:28.290
I love everything about her.
I love her.

109
00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.840
Her passion for,

110
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.630
for life and for people and for Torah or love for Torah

111
00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:39.070
<v 0>means a lot to me.</v>

112
00:08:43.810 --> 00:08:48.100
<v 1>Yeah.
I think that I have to say anything except that I love you so much and I am</v>

113
00:08:48.101 --> 00:08:48.370
great.
