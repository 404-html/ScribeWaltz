00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.830
What made you go viral?

2
00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.140
It's just the video of me in the bathroom and then like the,

3
00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.890
the phrase was Pika Pika didn't fit.
Oh,

4
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.020
okay.
So yeah,

5
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.630
I was just in the bathroom and then I had a

6
00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.470
<v 1>you negative,
you get the sage grouse,</v>

7
00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.700
girl's name Harris.
What that,
what goes you?
Am I still alive?

8
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.930
<v 0>So I was just casually walking around,
Hey,</v>

9
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.970
I'm recording and guess what I look,

10
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:46.020
guess what if I did my Pontiac Pika,
Pika Bitch,

11
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.110
my name is Karen.
My Instagram is fruity pop in.

12
00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.390
I am 18 years old and I currently have 1.4 million followers.

13
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.993
<v 2>Ooh.</v>

14
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.760
<v 0>How did you come up with the name?
Pretty tough.
Well pop in like,</v>

15
00:01:09.761 --> 00:01:14.320
you know when people go like Ooh,
you pop in,
you know,
that's like a sane.
So,

16
00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.240
um,
and I like fruits.

17
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.610
So you're pumping it is nice.
My brand.
Hey Man,

18
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.790
Gucci,
my first got Instagram,

19
00:01:28.791 --> 00:01:33.791
I think I was 15 that then it started getting more attention when I was 17.

20
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.660
It just kinda happened at all.
Just rushed up.

21
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.050
I would see lots of reposts of my posts and then bigger celebrities posted it,

22
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.070
like Chris Brown re posted it and I was just like,
oh,
that's me.

23
00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.900
So then you started getting followers.
Yeah.
Like right away.
Yes.

24
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.640
Hey guys,
my question button isn't working for some reason,

25
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.470
but I want you guys to me your questions because I won't be answering them and

26
00:02:10.471 --> 00:02:11.304
my stories.

27
00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.220
So I love engaging with people.
I love meeting New People.
Uh,
lots of dams.

28
00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.890
It's a great platform to reach out to people and to connect with people.

29
00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.510
And it's like hosting a big party.

30
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.410
I didn't,

31
00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.410
I didn't really realize how powerful Instagram was as a business tool until I

32
00:02:51.611 --> 00:02:56.611
was reached out by bigger companies who offered compensation along with,

33
00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.140
you know,
free stuff.

34
00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.280
You give us a ballpark figure of how much you conveyed from one post.

35
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:04.720
It's like Trump,
the right sponsor,

36
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.740
<v 1>let's not talk about,</v>

37
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.190
<v 0>in the back of my mind,
I had university rolling around,
so I was just like,
oh,</v>

38
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.010
I should consider this.
I am,

39
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:22.773
I am.

40
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.370
<v 1>We should sit at the path.</v>

41
00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.820
<v 0>I feel independent in a way.
But again,</v>

42
00:03:29.821 --> 00:03:33.900
I'm really thankful to be blessed with having this platform.

43
00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:38.910
It's just amazing and I don't have to burden my parents with having them pay for

44
00:03:38.911 --> 00:03:39.744
my tuition.

45
00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.930
<v 1>I lost it.
No,
I lost the question.
Someone asks me.</v>

46
00:03:48.931 --> 00:03:53.880
My favorite color was
yellow

47
00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:59.670
<v 0>environment and sustainability,</v>

48
00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.760
so we were learning about the environment and sustainability.

49
00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.893
<v 1>Y'All</v>

50
00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.980
<v 0>just sipping my afternoon's team.</v>

51
00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:32.330
That's best out my story.
A lot of,
a lot of the questions are really nice.

52
00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.960
They usually ask,
how are you so pretty or how you so cute.

53
00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.890
I usually just say thank you.
Yes,

54
00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:43.880
and I send to heart.

55
00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.923
<v 1>Oh</v>

56
00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.270
<v 0>the good thing about social media is that you can easily reach out to people.</v>

57
00:04:51.271 --> 00:04:54.960
He can easily discover who you are and your interests.

58
00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:00.770
But a con to that would be the fact that social media could really be damaging

59
00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.390
to your,
your image of yourself.
Some people would be like,

60
00:05:06.391 --> 00:05:10.560
she's not even funny.
Right?
Like that's the basic simple stuff.

61
00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:15.510
But then some people would go deep and like dig into your physical appearance.

62
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.910
I've also heard like you're a public figure,
you're a celebrity.

63
00:05:19.911 --> 00:05:24.590
You should be used to like having these things said to you and it's like,
oh,

64
00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:26.323
I mean,

65
00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.580
most of the time I would take it to heart to be honest,

66
00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.250
but it shouldn't affect me because it's just through a screen.

67
00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:35.423
<v 1>You know,</v>

68
00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:44.420
<v 0>I wanted to take a little Halloween pose.
Of course,
I dressed up,
um,</v>

69
00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:49.050
took some photos,
I think a lot.
I think like a hundred.

70
00:05:49.051 --> 00:05:53.700
And that's not even,
not even over overdoing it for me.

71
00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.940
I choose the one or two that are,

72
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.850
<v 1>and then I put it through Visco,
which is a filter app.</v>

73
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:07.330
I posted it and I usually try to engage with as many people as I can by asking

74
00:06:08.561 --> 00:06:11.120
him questions.
And it's just a fun time.

75
00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:17.370
4,000,

76
00:06:17.371 --> 00:06:22.110
311 and it's been three minutes.

77
00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:33.530
<v 0>Oh yeah.
Well,
it's radical.</v>

78
00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:38.090
Instagram has definitely changed the way I see my future.

79
00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:40.580
I'm in university as a sociology student,

80
00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.130
but because my Instagram kind of took off,

81
00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:48.030
I'm thinking of switching into creative industries.
I'd love to,
you know,

82
00:06:48.031 --> 00:06:52.160
make films,
be in shows,
being movies direct.
Right.

83
00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:58.733
<v 1>Oh,</v>

84
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.370
okay.
You look,
you're like,
Yo,

85
00:07:08.371 --> 00:07:10.510
I don't even do this.
Like it was like Abby Levine

86
00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:14.430
best friends.

87
00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:21.620
Have a good day to send that to me.
Okay.
I will have a nice day.
Bye.

88
00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:23.453
<v 0>Oh,</v>

89
00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:27.990
I want to create content to make people happy.

90
00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:32.700
If I can make their day or you know,
make them forget about something that's sad,

91
00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:36.830
then I'll,
I'll post some and try to make them happy.
You know

92
00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:40.110
who's his name?
Tenisha

93
00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:54.550
Oh yes,
for sure.
I'm so happy with my life.
Uh,
things are going great.

94
00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:58.720
I like to look at things in a positive light and I'm positive.

95
00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:03.490
Outlook is what makes you happy.
So a lot of things are going really well.

96
00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:10.510
<v 1>23,000.</v>

97
00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:32.950
<v 2>What do you give them too when you get home?</v>

98
00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:39.790
<v 1>Know what?
I'm probably going to take a nap.
I know I should be studying,</v>

99
00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:42.220
but maybe after my nap.

100
00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:48.280
Thank you and Julie are coming to Toronto.
It was really great.

101
00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:53.260
Let's hope it loans though.

102
00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:59.910
We try.
We thought

103
00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:05.760
stay fruity.
Stay poppin.

104
00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:09.600
Go do some jewelry.
Watches.
