1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.230
None of you have the balls to be with someone as beautiful as I am.

2
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.133
<v 1>Okay.</v>

3
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.940
<v 3>My name is Sharelle holder and I'm a plus size model.</v>

4
00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.430
Take off your robe and look at your body in the mirror.

5
00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.790
Describe the feelings and thoughts you have.

6
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.410
Well,
it's kind of a love hate relationship,

7
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.610
but I mean for now it's mostly love relationship.

8
00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.370
<v 5>My name is Chris.
I am a 22 years old.</v>

9
00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.430
I noticed that my cheeks,
I slow,
pretty chubby.
They're chubby or then

10
00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.360
I would ideally like for them to be,

11
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:02.960
my name is Raquel Hargrove.

12
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.280
<v 0>I think I feel very lucky that my body moves and it does the things I want it to</v>

13
00:01:10.821 --> 00:01:14.660
and yeah,
it feels good.
It feels,
it feels like a home.

14
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.970
<v 3>I'm Mandy,
I'm 21 I feel very ambivalent,</v>

15
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.350
like I look at myself and I don't hate anything.
I see.

16
00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:27.300
<v 6>Okay.</v>

17
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.250
<v 0>My name is Richard 19</v>

18
00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.013
<v 6>so skewed.</v>

19
00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.040
<v 0>I don't usually show off my body often.
Right.</v>

20
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.920
<v 6>This one,
this is,
this is new.
Definitely new.</v>

21
00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:47.540
<v 2>Can I take it?</v>

22
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.110
<v 0>Go ahead.
Oh,
okay.</v>

23
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.090
Do you feel pressure to have a specific shape?

24
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.600
<v 3>See this is really interesting in my life right now as a plus size model because</v>

25
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.130
I have been going through this process to really lose weight for my diabetes.

26
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:07.160
So in losing weight I'm no longer the ideal like size 14 but also the modeling

27
00:02:09.061 --> 00:02:13.110
realm is shifting too.
They want more pear shaped and I'm more hourglass.
So yeah,

28
00:02:13.111 --> 00:02:14.550
I definitely feel pressured right now.

29
00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.700
<v 0>I think it very much was like to do with my relationship with men.</v>

30
00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.760
I've never been like outright insulted for my height at all,

31
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.420
but everyone is like,
oh,
I loved your tall.
It's so cool.

32
00:02:26.421 --> 00:02:31.040
Like some guys are gonna love that.
Not me though.
I don't know.
I can,

33
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.310
I just,
I can do personally I'm like,
you're not original.

34
00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.570
None of you have the balls to be with someone as beautiful as I am.

35
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.570
That's the problem.
That's it.
That's all it is.

36
00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:46.570
I'm six two and if I had a wish it would be to go back in time and spend less

37
00:02:49.791 --> 00:02:52.460
time caring about what my body looks like.

38
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.490
I just hated being so much taller than everyone.

39
00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.550
I think there's women were made to feel like we're supposed to be and I am very

40
00:03:01.061 --> 00:03:04.180
grateful now for this height that I have,
that I walk into a room and I'm like,

41
00:03:04.181 --> 00:03:05.180
you have to listen.
Okay.

42
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.210
<v 7>You can't ignore me.</v>

43
00:03:06.211 --> 00:03:08.880
I'm here to take up space and I'm not going to feel bad about it.

44
00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.843
<v 0>Okay.</v>

45
00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.100
<v 3>What type of body are you attracted to?</v>

46
00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.750
<v 5>I guess the more PC answer wouldn't be,
it's all about the personality.</v>

47
00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:26.480
<v 0>No.</v>

48
00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.950
<v 5>Uh,
ideal body.
Uh,</v>

49
00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.980
I guess I would prefer someone who I guess is either like fit or like curvy,

50
00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.100
but it's not necessarily a deal breaker if they're not those things.
Yeah.

51
00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.140
<v 3>This is a hard question for me because I'm slightly on the asexual spectrum</v>

52
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.010
label that's helpful for me is demisexual,

53
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.030
which means that like I literally cannot feel any physical attraction unless

54
00:03:55.031 --> 00:03:57.910
there is some pretense of like emotional connection.

55
00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.590
I feel like I am relatively privileged to be in a body that's not skewed away

56
00:04:06.581 --> 00:04:11.470
from beauty standards and social norms.
Like I have like a small figure.

57
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.270
I haven't gotten a lot of like,

58
00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.590
or at least I haven't listened to a lot of messages that have told me that I

59
00:04:17.591 --> 00:04:21.310
should change.
So I look at myself and I'm like,
Yup,

60
00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:22.840
that's me.

61
00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.940
<v 2>Okay.</v>

62
00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:26.950
<v 0>Hi.
Hi.</v>

63
00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.440
How do you love your body?
I don't know.

64
00:04:32.441 --> 00:04:34.300
I really try to sleep a lot.

65
00:04:34.301 --> 00:04:38.050
I think that's like a thing for me where I recognized that I kind of start to

66
00:04:38.051 --> 00:04:40.240
fall apart if I'm like not sleeping.

67
00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.320
It was like I don't care enough about like this shell that I'm living in enough

68
00:04:44.321 --> 00:04:47.950
to like take care of it and try to eat healthy and try to like drink water and

69
00:04:47.951 --> 00:04:52.210
try to sleep.
I would probably start primarily with food,

70
00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.120
especially when I'm taking care of my voice.
I do a lot of singing,

71
00:04:55.121 --> 00:04:58.850
so I never drank like a full can of soda before.
So

72
00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:05.340
yeah.
Exercise,
play,
really.
I am.
I'm not,
I'm not that occurs,

73
00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.470
but it's,
it's dietary habits,
right?

74
00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.480
<v 6>This voice matters to me a lot.
Well,</v>

75
00:05:11.481 --> 00:05:15.650
the rest of this body is the most significant thing per se.

76
00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:20.600
My voice stands out.
I'm able to just be myself while singing.

77
00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:23.810
Of course I have my insecurities,
but you know,
it's,

78
00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:25.813
that's my life.

79
00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.380
<v 3>You saying just a little bit for a sweatshirt</v>

80
00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.083
<v 8>before the pool</v>

81
00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:34.730
<v 0>passes my,</v>

82
00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:40.220
I'm going to go and taste back into my life.

83
00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:43.003
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

84
00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:46.940
<v 3>What is your favorite activity to do that involves your body?</v>

85
00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:51.080
For me,
my favorite activity to do on this,

86
00:05:51.081 --> 00:05:56.060
the body is dancing.
I love dancing and that's kind of like,

87
00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.601
I don't know,

88
00:05:56.601 --> 00:06:01.220
almost like for me like whether it's twerking or salsa or whatever it is,

89
00:06:01.221 --> 00:06:04.580
like I just need to let it go.
It makes me feel sexy I guess.
Yeah.

90
00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:07.740
<v 5>I guess for me it's weight training.
Uh,</v>

91
00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:12.810
it was initially I guess a mindset I had where if you were like more muscular,

92
00:06:12.971 --> 00:06:14.590
like a skinny,
whatever it may be,

93
00:06:14.591 --> 00:06:19.030
that it would magically make everything great.
Yeah.
Yeah.

94
00:06:19.031 --> 00:06:22.680
If I had like more,
you know,
brought her shoulders or like a six pack and like,

95
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.460
like girls wouldn't be running,
running.

96
00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:30.910
It's gone to me a little bit better and a lot of regards in terms of like just

97
00:06:30.911 --> 00:06:35.170
how I see myself,
how like my confidence levels and like how I go about my life,

98
00:06:35.171 --> 00:06:38.900
but at the same time it's hilarious processing growing up,

99
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:42.860
just being more defined by the fact that I was overweight,

100
00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:47.870
I kind of envied in a way people that were in better shape.

101
00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.560
From my perspective,
it seemed like they had everything all together.

102
00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:56.210
I guess kind of being on the flip side of that coin now it's very different in

103
00:06:56.211 --> 00:06:58.250
terms of you don't have everything set,

104
00:06:58.251 --> 00:07:01.430
you don't have everything together just because you're of a better shape.

105
00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:02.660
My body,

106
00:07:02.661 --> 00:07:07.661
my shape is a reflection of the fact that I don't let shape define me as much.

107
00:07:08.721 --> 00:07:09.554
Anymore.

108
00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:15.120
<v 3>A struggle that you've experienced in life that involves your body?</v>

109
00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:20.720
<v 9>I think it just has to do with the Eczema again.
Yeah,</v>

110
00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.020
<v 3>it was really bad.</v>

111
00:07:22.021 --> 00:07:26.160
As a kid I would always wear long clothes so I could hide my arms.

112
00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:27.450
Like I became like really quiet,

113
00:07:27.451 --> 00:07:30.930
really close and like the way I dressed kind of reflected that.

114
00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:35.460
I went through the same exact thing,
but definitely that wearing long sleeves,

115
00:07:35.461 --> 00:07:35.971
long pants,

116
00:07:35.971 --> 00:07:40.710
even when it's the dead of summer growing up and not only having bad eczema but

117
00:07:40.711 --> 00:07:45.570
also be the Chubby kid was like really rough cause it's like,
okay,

118
00:07:45.571 --> 00:07:49.170
nobody likes me,
you know,
like no boys like me kind of thing.

119
00:07:49.171 --> 00:07:52.930
And I was always taller than them too.
So it's like,
okay,
well we've made it,

120
00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:54.640
we're here.

121
00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:58.600
It's like super cool to hear because you've seen so like in your body.
Yeah.

122
00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:02.290
And I think I had to go through those struggles to become this person,
you know,

123
00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:04.810
that it really made me mature really fast.

124
00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:10.810
Do you think your body is beautiful?
I do.

125
00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:12.700
I do.
Um,

126
00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:18.450
it's kind of like a roller coaster ride up and down in terms of I'm happy with

127
00:08:18.821 --> 00:08:22.390
it and then I'm not happy with it.
I like my curves.

128
00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:26.860
I um,
just like the way that it's shaped,

129
00:08:26.861 --> 00:08:30.940
I think it's very flattering.
Um,
I like the way clothes look on my body.

130
00:08:30.941 --> 00:08:33.750
So though not perfect.
Um,

131
00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:36.190
I think that she gets the job done.

132
00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:40.233
<v 9>Let's see.</v>

133
00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:43.080
<v 3>Has anyone ever criticized your body?</v>

134
00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:50.090
My family.
Like it's really easy for relative to say like,
oh,

135
00:08:50.091 --> 00:08:53.600
like you should eat more.
Literally every time I Skype with my parents,

136
00:08:53.601 --> 00:08:55.980
they all know your face look smaller.
I'm like,
Oh,

137
00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:00.720
<v 0>like what?
Like my aunt kept annoying me.
Eat more burgers.</v>

138
00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:04.350
[inaudible] yes.
And I'm like,
I'm eating,

139
00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:08.400
I'm eating at the end it like,
it's like I never gained a pound.

140
00:09:08.401 --> 00:09:11.790
And sometimes I'm like,
how did I lose a pound?
At this point,

141
00:09:11.791 --> 00:09:16.680
I've sorta just numbed it out.
I'm like,
all right.
That's just who I am.
I'm just,

142
00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:17.993
I'm okay with it.

143
00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:26.370
<v 6>It's not the most outrageous body.
It's not the most,
you know,</v>

144
00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:30.960
I have a six pack or I need sing the song.
It's sort of just,
it's me

145
00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:34.890
and I am beautiful.

146
00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:39.430
I am the best person who I can be right now.

147
00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:43.150
And while there's always room for improvement,

148
00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:48.790
there's always the state where you can just relax,

149
00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:50.313
be you,

150
00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:54.910
and be the most beautiful person you can be at that moment.

151
00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:56.600
<v 11>Huh?</v>
