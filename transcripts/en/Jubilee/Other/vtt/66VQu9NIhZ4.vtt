00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.670
Petra,
there's a really frightening man behind you.

2
00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:05.380
He looks really serious.

3
00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:06.690
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

4
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:07.590
<v 0>That would really freak her out.</v>

5
00:00:07.591 --> 00:00:09.570
I can't say things like that in our relationship.

6
00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:13.983
You want this one?

7
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.350
No.
Should I be nervous?
You know,
I have no filter.

8
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.630
She has no filter.
My name is Robin.

9
00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:34.510
I'm Petra.
Eight months.

10
00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.760
<v 3>Well we were on the base at the same time,
so we kind of remembered.
Yeah,</v>

11
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.220
it was June of last year and we met an ecstatic dance and I just remember him

12
00:00:55.071 --> 00:00:58.440
kind of like coming up next to me would be,
sorry,
Gen z,
can you folks?

13
00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.570
Smiley lead.
And he's really cute.
And I was just like,
wow.
He shiny

14
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.290
<v 0>good music.
Good choice.
Yeah,
totally.</v>

15
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.560
I have no idea what you were saying was enjoying.
You're smiling and laughing.

16
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.360
<v 2>I hope that was like a thing.</v>

17
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.820
<v 0>Um,
we were at an event called ecstatic dance.</v>

18
00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.770
I was just dancing and doing my thing.

19
00:01:23.771 --> 00:01:28.510
And then behind me I see this like bright shiny girl,

20
00:01:28.511 --> 00:01:31.810
just like skipping around the room.
I was like,
oh,
hey.
Um,

21
00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:36.870
after the event we started to chat a little bit and I could just tell that we,

22
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.230
that we were just engaged,
that we would just really present with each other

23
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:44.473
<v 1>first impression.</v>

24
00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.110
<v 0>It's like literally,
wouldn't you like movies?
A handler?
Like seek glitter,</v>

25
00:01:50.111 --> 00:01:50.944
go ahead.

26
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.830
<v 3>It was actually really awkward.
Like,
and we've never talked about this.</v>

27
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.950
I like totally not ready for it.
Totally caught me off guard.

28
00:02:02.951 --> 00:02:06.300
And you know how in like hitch,
I think they say you've got to be like 50,
50,

29
00:02:06.301 --> 00:02:10.530
or 80,
20 or so,
people like that.
And he was like full on like what Chris said,

30
00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.790
I was just like,
whoa.
Like,
okay.
And it was just like,
all right,

31
00:02:14.791 --> 00:02:15.690
I guess he's into me.

32
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.690
<v 0>I just felt like I was,
we were in the friend zone and like,</v>

33
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.530
or in danger of it.
So I like,
I just at the end,
it's a bit embarrassing now,

34
00:02:25.531 --> 00:02:30.531
but I just like leaned in and kissed her and it was pretty awkward and a bit

35
00:02:31.081 --> 00:02:34.040
sort of like Steph,
but like I just,
I don't know,

36
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.000
I just kind of had to let her know like,
look,

37
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.510
I don't want to be in the friend zone.

38
00:02:38.511 --> 00:02:41.580
And I guess that was my way of expressing that.

39
00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:47.930
Oh yeah.
We haven't really spoken about that

40
00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.210
now said at the time that it has to come up.
Right.
Well first of all,
I'm sorry,

41
00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.650
I'm sorry that I was comes in that moment and maybe couldn't articulate through

42
00:02:59.651 --> 00:03:03.640
words that,
hey,
I think you're nice and I'm going to be really cool,
but hey,

43
00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.750
I just at least wanting to express to you that I like it.

44
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.880
<v 3>Okay.
I forgot to talk about that first kiss.
It's done</v>

45
00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.920
on camera.
Great.

46
00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.760
I just remembered like being in bed with him and I was just like,

47
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.770
Robin.
I said,
can I tell you something?

48
00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.180
You're going to be cured.
He knew what I was going to say and he was just like,

49
00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:33.290
do you love me?

50
00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.250
<v 0>We'd been dating for like a month or so.</v>

51
00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.780
I think one morning she sort of looked over at me and was like,

52
00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.310
I um,
I kind of,
um,
and she,

53
00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.770
she didn't quite go through with saying the words,

54
00:03:51.771 --> 00:03:55.700
but I kind of looked over at her and was like,
yeah,

55
00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.610
and I'm trying to think,
did she actually say it?

56
00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.780
<v 3>I think one of like the best day ever we call it was December 14th of last year</v>

57
00:04:06.781 --> 00:04:10.760
and we went down to San Diego to get his passport for the Swedish.
Yeah,

58
00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.670
we just need like a whole day out of it.

59
00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.540
<v 0>We go to Balboa Park and like we're both imagining like,
oh,</v>

60
00:04:15.541 --> 00:04:17.940
it's an enormous park.
We're going to pick nick,
am I going to play?

61
00:04:17.941 --> 00:04:18.980
And it's gonna be amazing.
We get there.

62
00:04:18.981 --> 00:04:21.830
It's like so much traffic and there's like not much park.

63
00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.620
<v 3>We were just looking for nature and so we just got lost in a parking lot
forever.</v>

64
00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.720
He lived since like,
we let us grab with the parent at the parks here suck.

65
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.030
<v 0>And it was Christmas,</v>

66
00:04:30.031 --> 00:04:34.470
so all the lights were up and the fountain was doing like beautiful things and

67
00:04:34.471 --> 00:04:36.240
so she brought these penguin Christmas hats.

68
00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.400
So we were both like going around just like a silly penguins and we just had the

69
00:04:41.401 --> 00:04:46.401
most incredible day from morning tonight and it will forever be known as the

70
00:04:46.531 --> 00:04:51.210
best thing ever and we will celebrate that day with Penguin Christmas hat.

71
00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.710
<v 3>That's when you really tap into your inner being when</v>

72
00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:03.940
I'm going to keep it PG,
the way that he looks at me.

73
00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.540
I remember like when I first started hanging out with them and when I would talk

74
00:05:10.541 --> 00:05:15.370
to them,
to my friends,
I would just be like,
oh my God,
his heart,
like his heart.

75
00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:23.010
<v 0>It's those eyes that just have so much life in them and so much love and so much</v>

76
00:05:24.281 --> 00:05:28.930
beauty and so sultry and so sexy and playful at the same time.

77
00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.750
No Way.
I have sultry eyes.

78
00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:42.850
She's,
she's mentioned my heart a few times and how she feels it,

79
00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.310
but I think that's what she likes about me.
She said,
yes,
she did.

80
00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:56.880
Not only do I find few,
just so beautiful in every single,

81
00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:02.290
but you're infinitely compassionate with me when I have,

82
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.570
whatever moments I have,
we'll make whatever projections I make,

83
00:06:05.571 --> 00:06:09.200
I'll go through my own stuff.
But beneath it all,

84
00:06:09.201 --> 00:06:12.560
that's just how I feel with you.

85
00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:18.940
Hey,
this really,
really appreciate you.

86
00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:25.770
You helped me realize a level of self love that is so much deeper than I've ever

87
00:06:29.771 --> 00:06:33.860
experienced.
Yeah.
Um,

88
00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.890
I know you're going through some challenges sometimes and still be so hard on

89
00:06:38.891 --> 00:06:41.500
herself.
I really feel like you're the whole package.

90
00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:43.810
<v 2>Thank you for</v>

91
00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:49.530
<v 0>making me be more who I am and who I can be and for loving me all the way.</v>

92
00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:01.120
Yes.
This one is like,
I think we're in,
we've rocked this relationship

93
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:03.160
<v 1>and.</v>
