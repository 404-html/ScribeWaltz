00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.050
I wanted to let you go and experience more because if there's something better

2
00:00:04.051 --> 00:00:07.320
for you,
I want that for you.
And vice versa.

3
00:00:07.321 --> 00:00:10.920
Like if there's somebody better for me,
like I want you to want that for me.

4
00:00:10.921 --> 00:00:11.630
Probably not.

5
00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.000
<v 1>Well
of course not.</v>

6
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.520
Hi,
I'm

7
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.140
<v 2>Shan Bu Dram,
but now Shannon Brady as a three weeks ago.</v>

8
00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:35.610
I am 33 years old and I'm a sex and relationship education,
right.

9
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.720
<v 0>I'm Jan Brady and I am 27 and I record music.</v>

10
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.670
We are married,
very newly married,
married for 23 days,

11
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.080
married for 23 days.

12
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.010
We actually met,

13
00:00:50.011 --> 00:00:55.011
I used to promote like a lounge bar slash thing and um,

14
00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.330
I invited a mutual friend of ours and she actually showed up with them,

15
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:05.630
but I don't really remember that night cause I was drinking a little bit.

16
00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.730
<v 2>I don't know why,
but this comes to mind like,
I'm not sure if he was doing that,</v>

17
00:01:09.731 --> 00:01:11.830
but when I think about when I first saw him,
he was like,

18
00:01:11.831 --> 00:01:15.330
that dude was like moving through the crowd.
It's like,

19
00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.370
that was my first impression.
I was like,
yeah,
this,
this dude has swag.

20
00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.960
But unfortunately he never did come to dance with me.
So that's how we met.

21
00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.130
But we didn't actually end up needing each other in person till a year after
that

22
00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.390
<v 0>she followed me on Instagram.
She sent me a message like,
let's hang out.</v>

23
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.250
And then I was like,
all right,
we had to establish that,
you know,

24
00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.610
her and I were just going to be,
am I allowed to cuss on here?

25
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.580
We're just going to be fuck buddies.
I Dunno.
We just kind of got each other on a,

26
00:01:45.581 --> 00:01:48.850
on a very deep level,
very like honest.
In the beginning,

27
00:01:48.851 --> 00:01:50.170
everything was up on the table.

28
00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.940
<v 2>First time I ever like got to like,
you know,</v>

29
00:01:54.941 --> 00:01:57.880
have a moment with you was inside my apartment,

30
00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.250
which now that I think about that is a little frightening,

31
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.950
<v 0>terrifying and knocked on the door.</v>

32
00:02:01.951 --> 00:02:06.150
He took an extra long time to answer and when you answered,
I was so relieved.

33
00:02:06.151 --> 00:02:09.330
I was like,
you're real.
You're a real person.

34
00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.520
<v 2>I was actually in New York and I was spending time with another dude while I was</v>

35
00:02:16.521 --> 00:02:18.650
in New York.
I was there for work,
but like,
you know,

36
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.210
I have friends around town and stuff.

37
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.450
The next day I was reflecting on my way to the airport and I was like,

38
00:02:23.451 --> 00:02:26.460
I had this great time with this dude in New York.
He's like,
we really vibe.

39
00:02:26.461 --> 00:02:28.910
He's really cool.
I vibe with him.
And then I'm like,

40
00:02:28.911 --> 00:02:31.070
I have this amazing connection with my friends with benefits.

41
00:02:31.071 --> 00:02:33.470
Like we're just so in sync.
He understands me.

42
00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:38.490
And so I tweeted out like I am learning so much about love without being an aero

43
00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:42.770
slug in arrows.
Love is a romantic lab,
like a deeply devoted romantic love.

44
00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.990
And Jared texts me and was like,
wait a second.
So it was our love,
not romantic.

45
00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.370
<v 0>I can't remember exactly what the tween is,
but had something to do with love.</v>

46
00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.690
And I remember just being like,
so wait,
so wait,
we don't have this type of love.

47
00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.330
<v 2>And then I was like,
but do you love me?
And then he was like,
yeah,
I do.</v>

48
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.530
And then I'm like,
Oh,
I love you too.

49
00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.410
<v 0>I didn't Google what arrows.
Arrows.</v>

50
00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.050
And so you're like,
wait,
you know what?
This means like,
yeah,
I know what it means.

51
00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.540
I know what it means,
what it means.

52
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.630
<v 2>We actually started calling our relationship open because I had somebody who I</v>

53
00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.770
from my past who I had unfinished feelings for that I hadn't seen a number of

54
00:03:26.771 --> 00:03:30.670
years come back into my life and so I had to come to Jared and be like,

55
00:03:30.671 --> 00:03:34.120
this isn't an unanswered question that if I don't get clarity on,

56
00:03:34.121 --> 00:03:35.620
I think this is going to haunt me forever.

57
00:03:35.621 --> 00:03:39.400
So like I need the opportunity to spend time with this person and for there not

58
00:03:39.401 --> 00:03:40.750
to be any limits on that.

59
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.870
<v 0>I wanted her to go and see what she felt about this person and choose me and</v>

60
00:03:45.871 --> 00:03:47.250
say,
you know what?
I want to be with you.

61
00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.460
Just because we're open doesn't mean that we don't feel,
you know,
jealous for,

62
00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.650
you know,
when,
when someone's going on a date or something like that,

63
00:03:55.651 --> 00:03:58.020
when it has happened,
of course we feel jealous about it.

64
00:03:58.021 --> 00:04:02.910
But I wanted to let you go and experience more because if there's something

65
00:04:02.911 --> 00:04:06.600
better for you,
I want that for you.
And vice versa.
Like,

66
00:04:06.601 --> 00:04:10.050
if there's somebody better for me,
like I want you to want that for me,

67
00:04:10.051 --> 00:04:13.110
probably not.
But uh,
of course not.

68
00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:15.800
But yeah,
no,
I,

69
00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.800
that's the reason why I felt like you should go and experience that because it

70
00:04:19.801 --> 00:04:24.330
would feel so much better to wake up to you every day knowing that you chose to

71
00:04:24.331 --> 00:04:25.530
wake up and do it with me.

72
00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.900
<v 2>Even when you've done music videos with other girls,
right?</v>

73
00:04:27.901 --> 00:04:31.980
Like it's not 100% like completely like,
yeah,
go ahead.

74
00:04:31.981 --> 00:04:34.620
Like do what you gotta do.
There's still that little thing.

75
00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:38.610
But I actually in some ways enjoy that thing because it reminds me that like

76
00:04:38.611 --> 00:04:39.710
this isn't a person that I own.

77
00:04:39.711 --> 00:04:43.290
Like this is an individual that I have the privilege of sharing time with and I

78
00:04:43.291 --> 00:04:45.030
should never take that for granted.

79
00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:52.040
<v 0>There was a time when we went on a hike and this was like at the time that we</v>

80
00:04:52.041 --> 00:04:56.240
were still kind of just having sex and we weren't really any things like

81
00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:57.403
official yet.

82
00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:02.560
And she had asked me to go with her to something or do something with her and I

83
00:05:03.381 --> 00:05:04.214
was like,

84
00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.820
I don't know about that because that's gonna put me in a different category.

85
00:05:07.821 --> 00:05:11.540
And I was really trying to like,
I don't know,
slow it down and,
and,

86
00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:16.340
and she was like,
well,
if you don't see anything here,
then what are we doing?

87
00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.960
Like,
why are we,
you know,
going on dates then we should have just kept it on.

88
00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.940
Just friends with benefits.
We ended up like,

89
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.570
not talking for a while because of that,
but I think it was the biggest argument,

90
00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:28.070
um,
that we had

91
00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:32.390
<v 2>the day that I thought he was going to propose and he didn't.</v>

92
00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:37.010
I was on a show and it was like my last day of taping for the show,

93
00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.150
he insisted on coming.
He's like,
I gotta be there early.
Like,

94
00:05:41.151 --> 00:05:46.040
he just made this big thing where I was like,
oh,
and sure enough,
like nothing,

95
00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:48.830
you know,
it's just like another day and it finished and you did,

96
00:05:48.831 --> 00:05:49.670
it didn't happen.

97
00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.720
And we got into the car and I didn't want to be upset because I'm like,

98
00:05:53.721 --> 00:05:54.830
this is so stupid of me,

99
00:05:54.831 --> 00:05:59.150
but we were starting to really create a life together and because of the fact as

100
00:05:59.151 --> 00:06:01.430
well too that our relationship was titled Open.

101
00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.360
They're just always so much negativity around our relationship and people

102
00:06:05.361 --> 00:06:08.570
thinking we don't see each other in a serious light,
and to me,

103
00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:12.800
solidifying our feelings with marriage would really just help to clear all that

104
00:06:12.801 --> 00:06:17.690
up.
The engagement.
Oh really?

105
00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:20.300
Yeah.
Know was talking about no makeup or breakout.

106
00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:24.060
<v 0>Oh Nah.
Yeah,
that wasn't bad.</v>

107
00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:28.210
I told him about the time we went on a hike.
Oh,
early on.
Yes.

108
00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:31.940
I couldn't remember anything.
Oh yes.
That was it.
That was about it.

109
00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:36.020
<v 2>I think we come into relationships with an idea of how it's supposed to be.</v>

110
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.930
We have a picture or a template that we want to like match up.

111
00:06:38.931 --> 00:06:41.510
Like we're tracing almost,
we're not creating new art.

112
00:06:41.511 --> 00:06:45.050
We're tracing what we've been told all these years and then that moment I'm
like,

113
00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:48.470
oh,
rip that piece of paper up.
That's not what this is.
This is Jared.

114
00:06:48.471 --> 00:06:50.480
This is a new person,
this is something different.

115
00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:53.810
And maybe you don't just get to get surprised by an engagement.

116
00:06:53.811 --> 00:06:57.110
Maybe you have to have a conversation and he's going to know your ring size and

117
00:06:57.111 --> 00:07:00.590
advance and like,
that's okay.
It's still beautiful.
And when the moment came,

118
00:07:00.591 --> 00:07:02.120
like you said,
it was still beautiful to me.

119
00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:06.120
<v 0>I see.
I see a couple of children,</v>

120
00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:10.880
I see a strong legacy and foundation.
Um,

121
00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.520
and I just see,
I dunno,
I'm just so excited to grow old with you.

122
00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:19.350
<v 2>I see joy,
I see like limitless building.
I see businesses,</v>

123
00:07:19.351 --> 00:07:23.880
I see kids,
I see experiences.
Um,

124
00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:27.240
but definitely the kids prior,
you know,
scares me the most.

125
00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:32.280
I'm grateful to be dating a younger person for that reason because it's very

126
00:07:32.281 --> 00:07:35.070
new.
Um,
but something that I definitely feel

127
00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:39.880
<v 0>I'm excited to get all then and just angry at the world together.</v>

128
00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:46.150
<v 2>And what were you angry at?
The world?
So how about you be,
uh,
I think the,</v>

129
00:07:46.151 --> 00:07:49.930
you know,
the kiss thing is sensitive for me.
Uh,
I think it's,
it's,

130
00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:54.160
it's scary for me.
It's like a new thing for me.
Um,

131
00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:58.900
and when I look at you,
I'm like,
yes,
dad.
You know,

132
00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:01.900
and I've never looked at someone before like that.

133
00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:04.660
<v 0>Ever since I met you,</v>

134
00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:10.220
I felt like I became a better person and I got to enjoy life a lot more.

135
00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:15.590
<v 2>You make me feel like spreading the news.</v>

136
00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:22.130
I to have said it better.
We just did our vows to so I'm like,

137
00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:25.940
I tried to copy and paste those,
copy and paste everything I said,
Jared,

138
00:08:25.941 --> 00:08:28.190
like it a shit.
This all,
you're the shit

139
00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:30.293
