00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.900
I have not had a conversation like this with a random person and a long time.

2
00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.470
<v 1>Yay.</v>

3
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.590
<v 0>A viral New York Times article featured 36 questions that could supposedly make</v>

4
00:00:13.591 --> 00:00:15.090
any two people fall in love.

5
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.260
We want it to see what would happen if we ask these questions to two complete

6
00:00:19.261 --> 00:00:22.440
strangers on a blind date.
My name,

7
00:00:22.441 --> 00:00:25.560
my full name is Jack Hara,
but I only go by Kira.

8
00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.710
I am single.
I'm excited.

9
00:00:31.711 --> 00:00:34.770
I mean they go really good or really bad.
So

10
00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.840
<v 2>my name is Russell and I'm single.
Super Sangal.
Actually.</v>

11
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.710
Uh,
it's still nervous.

12
00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.880
I think like all this on all the anticipation leading up to it.

13
00:00:48.881 --> 00:00:51.670
It's like making it worse.

14
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.940
<v 0>Hello.
Hi,
how are you doing?
I'm Russell.
I'm Kara.
Kara,

15
00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.960
I guess we're having tea.
Yeah,
these are cute.
I know,
right?

16
00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.740
I like this set up.
I know it's very,
uh,
Zin.

17
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.180
Should we cheers first blind date,
right?
Yeah.

18
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:19.733
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

19
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.770
<v 2>Well that's good.
We're doing this.
Okay.
It's going to ask,</v>

20
00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.340
when did you last sing to yourself and to someone else?

21
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.810
<v 0>Um,
the last time I spoke to myself was last night cause I'm always in my room</v>

22
00:01:35.811 --> 00:01:40.460
dancing and singing,
um,
to someone else probably this morning.
What about you?

23
00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:45.260
<v 2>Um,
I sang to myself this morning for sure.
Getting Ready.
Okay.
Um,</v>

24
00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.460
that's probably a daily occurrence.
Yeah.
It's either singing or rapping a ball.

25
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.800
<v 0>Do you have a secret hunch about how you will die?
Okay.</v>

26
00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.180
<v 2>Oh that's creepy.
Um,</v>

27
00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.650
no but interesting fact when I was like 19,

28
00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.520
I had just had like this belief that I was going to die young.

29
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.230
Do we re I was having Deja Vu so often.

30
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.460
<v 0>Do you believe in Deja Vu and has an off topic?
There's no topics,
right?</v>

31
00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.960
They just,
who is so weird?
Cause there's like really random times.
I'm like,

32
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:21.400
I've done this before.
You know how like Mario Kart?
Uh,
the checkpoints.

33
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.940
Checkpoints.
Yeah.
Oh

34
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.000
here we go.
If you could change anything about the way you were raised,

35
00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.013
what would it be?

36
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.913
<v 2>Oh,</v>

37
00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.940
I probably would have liked to heard a little bit more.

38
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:43.710
My mom passed when I was young,

39
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.040
when I was like seven and I was raised by a single dad.

40
00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.200
He was just always so busy.
Yeah.
He's a doctor.
He's a pediatrician like and yeah,

41
00:02:52.201 --> 00:02:53.490
I don't want it to come off like I'm

42
00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.900
<v 0>no,
don't like this is your experience.</v>

43
00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:56.150
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

44
00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.590
But I just don't want it to sound like I'm ungrateful or anything like that.

45
00:02:58.591 --> 00:03:00.060
Like my the

46
00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.983
<v 0>best,</v>

47
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.920
I wish I didn't know the details of my mom and my dad's relationship and the

48
00:03:09.281 --> 00:03:14.140
details of the dysfunction because now I carry that as a woman.

49
00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.380
But you recognize it,
right?
Yeah,
it is what it is.
Yeah.

50
00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:22.600
Now I can like break the cycle,
but it's still like that's not easy.
Yeah.

51
00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.650
Growing up sucks.
I know,
right?
Cause then you're like,
oh,
I'm really fucked up.

52
00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.070
But then it's like,
oh wait,
everyone's really fucked up.
Complete this sentence.

53
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:38.100
I wish I had someone with whom I could share.data.

54
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.370
<v 2>I wish I had someone with whom I can share my love for food.</v>

55
00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.380
<v 0>Oh my gosh.
Is that it?
Are you serious?
I love to eat.
Okay.</v>

56
00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.230
It's over.
We're good.
All right.
Um,

57
00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.890
I wish I had someone to share.

58
00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.530
I'm gonna say my love for dancing in the mirror to Beyonce.

59
00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:06.510
Like I have friends who like love Beyonce like me,
but it's just not the same.

60
00:04:06.511 --> 00:04:09.820
Like I need my girl,
like she's not here,
so I feel,
yeah.

61
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.933
Okay.

62
00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:21.140
<v 2>Take one minute and tell your partner your life story as much detail as
possible.</v>

63
00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.500
<v 0>Oh my gosh.
Ooh.</v>

64
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.620
I'm trying to think of good stuff and bad stuff cause I don't want to bias your

65
00:04:26.621 --> 00:04:30.710
story or I know.
So I was born man,

66
00:04:30.711 --> 00:04:34.970
New York when I was about six years old.

67
00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.270
I witnessed my dad

68
00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.130
become physically violent towards my mom.

69
00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:48.190
Maybe about a few months after we ended up moving and that was the start of

70
00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:53.150
moving all the time.
I went to Buffalo State College in my last year.
I was like,

71
00:04:53.151 --> 00:04:57.740
you know what,
I've outgrown this place.
I don't feel like it's given me anything.

72
00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.220
Um,
I was actually like depressed that just wasn't happy.

73
00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:06.850
And then I decided to move to California and I moved here by myself with very

74
00:05:07.191 --> 00:05:08.024
little money.

75
00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.930
But I have a lot of faith and I believe that if you really want something it's

76
00:05:11.931 --> 00:05:16.520
because you're supposed to have it.
So I just,
we just did it and now I'm here.

77
00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.120
<v 2>I have so much respect for.</v>

78
00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:20.550
<v 0>Wow.
Thank you.</v>

79
00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.270
<v 2>Real.
Yeah,
thank you.
Definitely that's inspiring.</v>

80
00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.660
So I lived in the same house my entire life up until college.

81
00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.620
I always wanted that.
I did everything my older brother did.
He started rapping,

82
00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.160
so I was like,
I'm going to start rapping too.

83
00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:34.920
<v 0>Is he annoyed by lies?
Like dude,</v>

84
00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:38.520
<v 2>I got into acting on my own though.
I brought it up to my house.</v>

85
00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:42.910
I think I'm going to major in acting.
He's like,
are you sure?
And I was like,

86
00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:43.923
okay,

87
00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:50.190
so have like this identity crisis with like career and passions and stuff like

88
00:05:50.231 --> 00:05:51.940
that.
My family is like super mixed too.

89
00:05:51.941 --> 00:05:56.170
So I had like that identity crisis thing were black,
white and Japanese.
Oh Wow.

90
00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.750
My Dad is all three.
Wow.
Yeah.
And then my mom was black and white.

91
00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:02.300
That's so interesting.
Well,
which part?
All of it.

92
00:06:02.301 --> 00:06:06.130
Like that's so many different like cultures makes them one.

93
00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:10.010
I just turned 30 it's,
yeah,

94
00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:14.690
I think that might be the Asian part of you.
I'll take it.
Whatever it is.

95
00:06:14.691 --> 00:06:18.980
Black don't crack all of the amazing skin.
Well,

96
00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:21.560
so I see people nodding.

97
00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:28.370
That's true.
Anyways,
I just turned 30 so that was like a really big,
I was like,

98
00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:30.460
are you,
what are you doing right?

99
00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:33.740
Are you really gonna gonna do what you say you've been trying to do or are you

100
00:06:33.741 --> 00:06:38.090
just gonna keep on doing this stuff?
So here we are.
Okay.
Yeah.

101
00:06:38.091 --> 00:06:41.780
Now it's like acting,
film making,
shifting the culture.

102
00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:46.580
Didn't you put your age out there?
I'll put mines.
I'm 24 that also,

103
00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:48.260
and I talked about the records show.

104
00:06:48.261 --> 00:06:53.240
I did not ask alternate sharing something you consider a positive characteristic

105
00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:54.170
of your partner.

106
00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:01.010
You seem very honest.
Oh,

107
00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:03.710
just in the way you like show up in the world.

108
00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.470
I don't even know how to respond to that one.

109
00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:10.250
I'm just going to take that one in Israel.
You're extremely brave.

110
00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:15.000
Thank you for moving out here like he did.
That's true.

111
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:18.380
I just grew up like an hour away from La.
Yeah.
You know,

112
00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:21.710
like the stakes are just so low for me to like come out here.

113
00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.100
But for you I was like really big deal,
so,
oh,
thank you.

114
00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:28.360
I feel like you're very confident to not in just like,

115
00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:32.510
like I'm confident in myself,
but like,
I don't know if that's true.
Um,

116
00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:37.490
I feel like it's becoming true.
Obviously you like to have a good time,

117
00:07:37.491 --> 00:07:39.510
like the whole,
that's anything less as,

118
00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:43.040
so actually don't go out that often though.
It's not even about like,

119
00:07:43.041 --> 00:07:47.600
you just enjoy your time.
Uh,
I started,
you'll start.
Okay.
That's fair.

120
00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:54.830
Oh,
this is good.
Okay.
Would you go on a second date with your partner?

121
00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:58.040
I would totally gone and second day with you.
Yeah.

122
00:07:58.041 --> 00:08:01.850
I have not had a conversation like this with a random person and a long time.

123
00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:06.350
I'm flattered.
Yes,
yes,
yes.
We got to go eat somewhere.
We did it.
We do.

124
00:08:06.351 --> 00:08:08.360
But like good food.
You didn't answer the question.

125
00:08:08.361 --> 00:08:12.620
Would you go in a second by second?
Yes.
Yeah.
Oh,
you're right.
You're right.

126
00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:13.950
You can't leave anything to his eyes.

127
00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:18.380
Never ever bring her around me right now.
I was like,
yes.

128
00:08:18.381 --> 00:08:21.430
And we have to go get some.
Yeah,
that's why I was saying yesterday for sure.
Okay.

129
00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:26.210
As a tradition,
we should always ordered tea.
I can dig that.

130
00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.160
That's a thing that a male too,

133
00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:38.140
