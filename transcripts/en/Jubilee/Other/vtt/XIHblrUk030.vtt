1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.140
You said some beautiful stuff like all she's loyal or there's something else you

2
00:00:04.141 --> 00:00:08.740
said and I want him to repeat it.
Oh my God.
When you're,
when you're,

3
00:00:08.741 --> 00:00:12.290
when you're walking by me,
why you said that you know,
you,

4
00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.060
you move side to side.

5
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.540
<v 1>My name is Paula.
We've been together for three years.</v>

6
00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:26.090
<v 2>My name is ty train.
I'll relationship.
It feels brand new.
Then we stay on.</v>

7
00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:27.423
That was good.

8
00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.780
<v 0>My first question is pretty easy.
Okay.
How did you two meet</v>

9
00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.070
<v 1>my friend?
She said thank you.</v>

10
00:00:36.071 --> 00:00:40.390
Call a really good with my best friend ty.
I was Waco.
I don't date black guys.

11
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.700
She was like,
not like wrong boom,
like ty,
he's Asian.
I was like,
well,

12
00:00:45.701 --> 00:00:47.920
I don't take agents either.
She was like,
well,

13
00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.120
it's time for you to date outside your race because it's not working.

14
00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.010
So we went out once a year for three years.
Yeah,

15
00:00:54.011 --> 00:00:58.270
I think he calls it playing hard to get.
I did.

16
00:00:58.271 --> 00:01:01.600
He was just so normal when I was like,
you're crazy.
And me.

17
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.430
<v 2>The sweaty we would takes off in and every time my question comes up with,</v>

18
00:01:06.431 --> 00:01:11.380
so when we're going to hang out,
oh,
will not get a reply.
She would text me,

19
00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.010
Louise say,
how you doing or how you been my we actually be well,

20
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.630
well well
and that question will come up again.

21
00:01:20.631 --> 00:01:24.460
So what am I winning?
You let me take you out showing.
I'll reply.

22
00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.780
So like every 30 days,
I guess one texts I center was,

23
00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.050
you may be busy but if you really want to hang out with someone,

24
00:01:32.051 --> 00:01:35.740
you will make the time to hang out with them.
You will find the time.

25
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.020
And she gave me the time.

26
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.320
<v 1>He thinks how he just thinks that it's a cause.
I was like to get ah,</v>

27
00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.340
<v 0>you know,
all the time I was playing hard to get.
Yeah.</v>

28
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.110
I wasn't really playing hard to get,
I was just
playing,

29
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.290
you know all that.
They like Mexican stuff.
Yeah.

30
00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.190
So I just thought you were going to be like,
damn,
that's crazy.
No,

31
00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.550
he didn't know you were so Mexican savvy.

32
00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.580
<v 2>That's what it was.
I understand.</v>

33
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.340
<v 1>Wow.
How old are you?
25</v>

34
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.280
38

35
00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.230
<v 0>how has the age difference?</v>

36
00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.300
<v 1>Um,
he teaches me stuff,</v>

37
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.130
how to handle situations because I'm not young anymore,

38
00:02:23.131 --> 00:02:23.964
so I can't be like,

39
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.550
<v 0>oh,
see,
I don't see it affecting.
I said,
Oh,</v>

40
00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.160
I think me and her were pretty much the same.
I think it's the same like that.

41
00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.670
Alright,
you're mocking me.

42
00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.260
<v 2>It was tough at some point she didn't understand in the alarm.</v>

43
00:02:49.261 --> 00:02:50.850
I'm pretty understanding myself,

44
00:02:50.851 --> 00:02:55.620
so she needs to go through it to understand to,
to grow up.

45
00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.090
But I don't,
I don't look too old though.
Right.
I don't look too old.

46
00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.420
Okay.

47
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.130
<v 1>I said you were going to say like,
really?
I don't,
I don't see it.</v>

48
00:03:07.131 --> 00:03:09.060
I thought he was at all like,
yeah man,

49
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.320
<v 2>we,
she mock me.
I do that quite often.</v>

50
00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.250
Work 10 12 years apart.

51
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.360
It was a learning curve for you and there's things I haven't been throwing you

52
00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:20.203
haven't

53
00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.300
<v 1>this week.
We've just,
we've gone through some really big learning experiences,</v>

54
00:03:27.301 --> 00:03:28.730
so I don't know right now

55
00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.480
<v 2>she's very deep.
She can express her feelings very well.</v>

56
00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.960
While I can't express my feeling as well as she can.

57
00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:42.140
<v 3>Paula said you are working through some things in your relationship.
Oh,
oh,</v>

58
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:44.553
<v 2>ah.</v>

59
00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.520
<v 1>What it all came down to is husband and wife.
We put each other first.</v>

60
00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.940
It's no matter what we put each other first we have to me,

61
00:03:53.941 --> 00:03:57.700
I mean it feels like we have an obligation to our children to,
you know,

62
00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.620
care for them and put of course their wellbeing first,

63
00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.530
but after a certain age,
you know,

64
00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.380
just it's your wife first and your husband first.

65
00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:13.430
<v 2>What is put your,
your wife first.
That's what you should do.</v>

66
00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.930
<v 1>I think it's been a beautiful learning experience.</v>

67
00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.780
I mean it wasn't beautiful going through it because you know,

68
00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.050
going through it is never a beautiful,
especially if we're going to get married.

69
00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.570
Yeah.
Forever.

70
00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:33.500
<v 3>It makes you so attracted to her</v>

71
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:39.390
<v 2>by appearance.
I love the way she walks when she walks from behind it.
She,</v>

72
00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.970
she walks left right,
left,
right.
That's appearance.

73
00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.780
But she's very loving man.

74
00:04:48.781 --> 00:04:51.870
When this girl knows that you're on her side,

75
00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.310
she will do anything and everything for you.

76
00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:02.100
There's something I would like to say
that day when she becomes my wife.

77
00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:07.410
We were good people before we met each other.
We'd gone to this relationship.

78
00:05:07.411 --> 00:05:08.490
We made each other better.

79
00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.480
She teaches me how to express my feelings when I've always had a hard time

80
00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:17.550
learning and knowing how to do that.
I'll probably end up crying.

81
00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.600
<v 1>Recently my son,
our son,
he was,
um,</v>

82
00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:35.640
in the middle of a bra and his mom was the main attraction.

83
00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.700
I didn't want to be in the middle of the drop of the Bra.
I didn't,

84
00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:44.350
it was so fast and I just went down and I was just down.

85
00:05:44.351 --> 00:05:48.880
I was covered and I was just,
I'm so worried because I'm thinking like,
oh my God,

86
00:05:48.881 --> 00:05:52.330
who has my son Tom Ice?
I looked over my son,
you know,

87
00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:56.950
ty had him and protected him and tie,
cried and tight doesn't.

88
00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.090
And so,
um,

89
00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:04.540
to see ty cry and to see my child be protected by this strong man,

90
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:11.810
it was like,
okay,
that's it.
Like I read my life,
like,
I'll sell my soul to you.

91
00:06:11.811 --> 00:06:15.820
Like,
yeah,
my hero.

92
00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:18.710
Since some beautiful stuff like

93
00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:21.180
<v 3>oil or something else.
You said.</v>

94
00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.550
<v 0>Oh my God.
When you're,</v>

95
00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.960
when you're walk are you said that you know,

96
00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:30.960
you move side to side,

97
00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.440
maybe Jesus.
What did your mom,

98
00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:44.520
<v 1>nope,
that time learning how to tap.
Yeah.</v>

99
00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:54.690
The fact that by the time I was able to get up and think straight and ask

100
00:06:55.451 --> 00:06:57.900
where's my son,
Ruben?

101
00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.820
And the fact that before I was even finish that sentence,

102
00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:05.520
when you had him under your care,
like Oh,
forever everything.
Yeah.

103
00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:13.900
Even when you think I met my toughest,

104
00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:18.230
always lucky no matter what.

105
00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:21.983
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

106
00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:25.760
<v 0>Chicken,
Joe cry.
I think you can just say period.</v>

107
00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:32.900
<v 1>That was a little bit like all like ha ha.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

108
00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:35.730
<v 0>Thought it was going.
We had to.
We should.
God Man,</v>

109
00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:39.740
that's a good question.
That's all right.

110
00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:47.630
My question.
Like what do you like most about my hair or eyelashes?

111
00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:49.053
Oh Man.

112
00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:55.720
<v 4>Okay.
Yo got it.
Okay,
so this is my true belief,
fam.</v>

113
00:07:55.721 --> 00:07:56.590
Lemme Tell Ya,

114
00:07:56.591 --> 00:08:01.560
you should subscribe in the day yet until you go to,

115
00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:05.120
<v 0>Oh,
you're supposed to wrap.</v>

116
00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:10.600
<v 4>Please do not unsubscribe.
In fact,
this button,</v>

117
00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:13.600
if you want more and subscribe rap battles.
That's right.

118
00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:17.480
We should put like a more videos right here though,
right here.
Okay.
Let's do it,

119
00:08:17.481 --> 00:08:18.820
but they're all right.
Good.
Cool.
Okay.
