1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:00.480
I Dunno.

2
00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.290
Halloween is just like a weird holiday to be dressing up as anybody else's

3
00:00:04.291 --> 00:00:06.780
culture.
Say the same thing about any costume.

4
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.900
Are you going to tell a six year old girl that she can't dress up like a pirate

5
00:00:09.901 --> 00:00:12.920
because she doesn't know the history of pirates.
Like oh that's very dense.

6
00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:42.063
<v 2>Three,</v>

7
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.070
<v 0>we're all technically white.
Yeah,
you're from England,
from Australia.</v>

8
00:00:52.071 --> 00:00:54.910
If you're from wherever,
South Africa,
you know,

9
00:00:54.911 --> 00:00:58.780
we all have these crazy places we come from and these people were around and we

10
00:00:58.781 --> 00:01:00.370
get those ideas from those people.

11
00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.240
But that doesn't mean us as a whole have no culture.
And as a white person,

12
00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:08.170
it's not really a culture.
You can have culture like I'm Hella Irish obviously,

13
00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:13.030
and that's a culture.
But then just being white is not a,
it's not a culture.

14
00:01:13.031 --> 00:01:14.830
I can't relate to you just because you're white.

15
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.520
I think you can say that for any ethnicity though,
if we were all black,

16
00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.750
can I relate to you guys if just because of the color of our skin?
Yes,

17
00:01:22.751 --> 00:01:24.790
because they go through very similar experiences.

18
00:01:24.791 --> 00:01:28.150
Like they'll get discriminated against and you're not getting discriminated

19
00:01:28.151 --> 00:01:30.970
against because of your skin color.
They can both relate to that,

20
00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.050
but I also feel like with culture we branch out.
We tried different things.

21
00:01:35.051 --> 00:01:38.410
We want to do different things.
So maybe we've lost a little bit of our culture.

22
00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.200
Maybe we're creating a new culture.
There you go.

23
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.060
<v 2>Three,
two,
one.</v>

24
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.090
<v 0>I Dunno what that is.
You can explain it.
Okay.</v>

25
00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:59.150
I'll stay here till like where I just reverse racism is like someone being

26
00:01:59.151 --> 00:02:01.070
racist against you because you are white.

27
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.210
Like do you believe that someone can be racist against a white person?

28
00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.993
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

29
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.450
<v 0>I grew up where it was completely like Hispanic culture.</v>

30
00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.220
I was constantly made fun of because I was white.
Oh,
white people can't dance.

31
00:02:18.221 --> 00:02:21.850
White people look stupid,
whatever.
They shouldn't say white people can't dance,

32
00:02:21.851 --> 00:02:25.900
but they can't.
They
just putting that out there.

33
00:02:25.901 --> 00:02:27.790
But I mean like being honest though,

34
00:02:27.791 --> 00:02:31.360
like they would say those mean things to me and more hurtful things in that it's

35
00:02:31.361 --> 00:02:35.470
like a hard pill to swallow because if I turned around and said black people

36
00:02:35.471 --> 00:02:40.390
can't dance,
I'd get hell for that.
But then if someone says the same words to me,

37
00:02:40.391 --> 00:02:44.230
it's somehow okay because you have to look at the difference of it though.

38
00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.150
And I relate to you.
I grew up with all Latino or black friends.

39
00:02:49.151 --> 00:02:51.220
I had very few white friends and yeah,

40
00:02:51.221 --> 00:02:54.060
I got made fun of for being like the white girl I was green got,

41
00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:59.100
and I didn't take offense to it because the huge part about racism is that

42
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.290
there's hate and oppression behind it.
And as a white person in America,

43
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.240
I do not feel oppressed.

44
00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.770
And I definitely think that we should take the log out of our own eyes before

45
00:03:10.771 --> 00:03:14.280
worrying about the saw dust and other people's like,
I totally agree with that.

46
00:03:14.281 --> 00:03:18.000
But there is Sada.
So that's kind of what,
just what I'm saying,
for me,

47
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.740
I feel like anything we do can come out racist to any other types of race.

48
00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.640
But at the same time if they say something mean or racist to us that we feel is

49
00:03:26.641 --> 00:03:29.220
racist,
it's kind of gets brushed off.

50
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.130
<v 3>I might think of the word racism.
I think more towards oppression.</v>

51
00:03:32.131 --> 00:03:33.740
So that's why I'm in the disagree.

52
00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.130
Like I'll deal with someone just being mean to me.
But whatever,

53
00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.340
<v 2>three,
two,
one.</v>

54
00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.680
<v 0>I think it's important to focus on race in order to bring us together.</v>

55
00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.700
There is a race issue in America and if we just avoid it all together and

56
00:03:58.701 --> 00:04:01.880
pretend like it's not happening,
nothing's going to change in my opinion.

57
00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.120
I kinda was thinking about the question differently because it's all I'm

58
00:04:05.121 --> 00:04:06.830
thinking about when I meet someone as,
oh,

59
00:04:06.831 --> 00:04:09.450
I'm white and she's not white and I'm white and she's not white like that.

60
00:04:09.451 --> 00:04:11.930
For me that's like what?
Focusing on races.
Yeah.

61
00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.740
I'm never going to be happy unless we just like all work together just to like

62
00:04:15.741 --> 00:04:18.500
treat each other like each other.
You know,
like there is no race.

63
00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:21.850
<v 3>Yeah.
And that,
that sounds great,
but it's like we're not there.
We're not there.</v>

64
00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.640
I feel like people who've had that perspective might also say like,
oh,

65
00:04:24.641 --> 00:04:27.700
I don't see color.
Try not,
you know,
try to have that attitude.

66
00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.140
I don't think that helps anybody.

67
00:04:29.141 --> 00:04:32.410
I think we need to like the respect each other's backgrounds and like that is

68
00:04:32.411 --> 00:04:37.210
only gonna happen if we do see color we do like appreciate everybody's

69
00:04:37.211 --> 00:04:38.044
differences.

70
00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.880
<v 2>Three,
two,
one.</v>

71
00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.820
<v 0>Yeah.
I think cultural appropriations very real.</v>

72
00:04:50.821 --> 00:04:52.830
You see all the time like Coachella,
you know,

73
00:04:52.831 --> 00:04:56.190
we're in La and you see people and the native American headdresses without

74
00:04:56.191 --> 00:05:00.360
knowing how important that is to native people.
Yeah,
exactly.

75
00:05:00.361 --> 00:05:03.870
I think there's a difference between respecting the culture and completely

76
00:05:03.871 --> 00:05:05.130
disrespecting the culture,

77
00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.840
but then also if you want to dress up on Halloween,

78
00:05:09.841 --> 00:05:14.470
like a Geisha because you like the costume,

79
00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:18.900
you think it's a beautiful costume.
That I wouldn't say is,
I wouldn't do that.

80
00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:23.700
I think if you're going to go and dress up as a geisha without knowing the

81
00:05:23.701 --> 00:05:26.310
importance of it and just being like,
well,
this is cute,

82
00:05:26.311 --> 00:05:27.630
like I'm going to put this on.

83
00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.820
And also even if you did know the importance and you're like,
I dunno,

84
00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:35.430
Halloween is just like a weird holiday to be dressing up as anybody else's

85
00:05:35.431 --> 00:05:37.920
culture.
Say the same thing about any costume.

86
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.010
Are you going to tell a six year old girl that she can't dress up like a pirate

87
00:05:41.011 --> 00:05:44.250
because she doesn't know the history of pirates?
Like,
oh,
that's a very different,

88
00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.310
it's just like that's very different.
Those are,
those are children.

89
00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.880
I think it's a lot about intention because I think we're in that thing at

90
00:05:51.881 --> 00:05:56.830
Coachella.
Like I feel like I would see that as that person mocking someone who,

91
00:05:56.831 --> 00:05:59.640
even if they don't intentionally mean it,
it's still a factor.

92
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:09.013
<v 2>One</v>

93
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:19.460
<v 0>only reason I'm at somewhat disagree is because a lot of my favorite rappers use</v>

94
00:06:19.461 --> 00:06:23.210
it frequently.
Like if I'm listening to my favorite childish Gambino Song,

95
00:06:23.211 --> 00:06:26.810
what's your drops it like a hundred times.
Yeah,
no,
that's a car.
It's like,

96
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.380
it's like I'm not sitting there thinking all these horrible things about black

97
00:06:30.381 --> 00:06:31.214
people and I'm like,

98
00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:35.450
it's just in the song and when I'm singing it comes out,

99
00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:37.520
there's like two different forms of the word.

100
00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:41.840
They're ends with an er and with an a and like with my friends,
they're like,

101
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:44.500
oh you can say it with an a like that won't hurt my feelings.

102
00:06:44.501 --> 00:06:48.260
Those people told me,
but also like even when I'm in the car by myself,

103
00:06:48.261 --> 00:06:51.170
like I still feel like it's not my place.

104
00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:54.050
Maybe I'll like whisper it like with an a at the end,
you know?

105
00:06:54.051 --> 00:06:56.810
Like if I'm by myself,
but like out of the respect for other people,

106
00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:59.120
I just think it's more appropriate.
And not to say it at all.

107
00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:01.880
Do you guys think rappers should stop putting it in their songs?

108
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.910
I feel like if there,
it's wrong though,

109
00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:08.630
I don't think it's wrong because the history of the n word com,

110
00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:13.640
you know slave owners would call black people as the n word with the hard r at

111
00:07:13.641 --> 00:07:14.474
the end.

112
00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:19.370
If black people want to take that word and claim it as their own and claim that

113
00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:23.540
that painful history and like be like f you,

114
00:07:23.541 --> 00:07:27.260
like I'm going to claim this word.
I think they should be allowed to do that.

115
00:07:27.261 --> 00:07:32.090
I don't think as a white person I have that right to take a word that was

116
00:07:32.091 --> 00:07:35.660
derogatory towards them.
They show 100% have the right to do that.
Okay.

117
00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:38.760
Do you think it's okay for a white person to sing the song to the same?

118
00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:39.920
They're all on the fence.

119
00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:45.020
<v 3>Like I feel like it's,
it's just,
it's a word used as like,
uh,
my friend basically.</v>

120
00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.220
And it like,
just like she said,

121
00:07:46.221 --> 00:07:49.040
if they want to take that back from its horrible origins,

122
00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:51.500
then I'm totally fine with that.
But as,
as a white person,

123
00:07:51.501 --> 00:07:54.960
you can't say that word without,
uh,
feeling a certain way.
Yes.

124
00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:00.370
<v 0>If you,
if they didn't put it in their songs,
you wouldn't say it,
right?
No.
Yeah.</v>

125
00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:03.850
So are they causing people to say that word more often?

126
00:08:03.851 --> 00:08:04.684
Because she wouldn't say it

127
00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:08.940
<v 3>white people's place to tell them what they can and cannot use.
So,</v>

128
00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:11.713
<v 0>ah,</v>

129
00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.950
<v 2>three,
two,
one.</v>

130
00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:25.500
<v 0>It's so sad to say because I never say it out loud,
but it's,</v>

131
00:08:25.501 --> 00:08:28.500
the truth is like getting pulled over by the police.

132
00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:33.270
I always feel like I have a little bit of a one up because I'm white because I'm

133
00:08:33.271 --> 00:08:36.210
a woman and I feel so bad that that's the truth.

134
00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:41.300
But this is a real thing and it's unfortunate for me as an individual,

135
00:08:41.311 --> 00:08:43.590
I feel like I'm not privileged.
Sure.

136
00:08:43.591 --> 00:08:47.790
Like white people background came from like being higher up on the scale,

137
00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:51.150
but I've gone through really hard things before if you know,

138
00:08:51.151 --> 00:08:53.220
I don't feel like I'm superior over other people.

139
00:08:53.221 --> 00:08:57.390
So as an individual I don't feel like I'm,
I think privileged,
I guess.

140
00:08:57.391 --> 00:08:59.340
I don't really think that I'm above other people.

141
00:08:59.341 --> 00:09:04.150
I just think that naturally I'm treated differently.
It's just perception.
Yeah,

142
00:09:04.151 --> 00:09:09.130
I think that's a huge misconception.
I have privileged that I didn't ask for it.

143
00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:14.110
It's just society sees me as like the standard for whatever reason.

144
00:09:14.111 --> 00:09:18.310
And because of that I get treated differently and I'm white privilege.
You know?

145
00:09:18.311 --> 00:09:22.690
Like you said,
it's not about what you've gone through or what you experienced.

146
00:09:22.691 --> 00:09:26.230
It's 100% how the world sees me.

147
00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:29.083
Do

148
00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:40.030
<v 2>can there be,
alright.</v>

149
00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:48.670
Don't worry guys.
I almost went there too.
Right.

150
00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.040
<v 0>I think like guilt.</v>

151
00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:55.500
Like I am like happy that I'm not oppressed but I'm not proud of like things

152
00:09:57.730 --> 00:09:59.200
people have done in the past.

153
00:09:59.380 --> 00:09:59.800
<v 3>When I,</v>

154
00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:03.700
when I think of big proud or something I think of something I worked for or that

155
00:10:03.701 --> 00:10:06.820
um,
I yeah,
I had to get,
I had to do nothing to be white,

156
00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:10.390
absolutely nothing and nothing was taken from me because I was white.

157
00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:11.800
It's like saying

158
00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:16.940
<v 0>I'm a proud white person is a completely different saying than saying I'm a</v>

159
00:10:17.401 --> 00:10:20.310
proud black person because when you hear I'm a proud black person,

160
00:10:20.311 --> 00:10:24.240
I think empowerment.
I think strength.
I think courage.
I think,
you know,

161
00:10:24.241 --> 00:10:27.390
all these amazing things that the black community has done and accomplished

162
00:10:27.391 --> 00:10:28.230
throughout the years.

163
00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:33.510
But then when you say I am a straw or I'm a proud white person already,

164
00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:37.740
there's so much like hate.
Yeah.
Involved in that.

165
00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:41.130
Thinking about that is like,
like how you said,
someone who says,

166
00:10:41.131 --> 00:10:43.170
I'm proud to be black.
That's empowerment.

167
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:47.070
Why aren't I allowed to be proud to be white?
What makes it,

168
00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:52.100
<v 3>yeah.
What are you proud of?
Just your skin color because yes,
that is wrong.</v>

169
00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:56.650
So you're saying I can't be proud to be white because I don't have a culture.
No,

170
00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:01.070
that's not what I'm am saying that when white people say that they're proud to

171
00:11:01.071 --> 00:11:04.310
be white,
a lot of times,
at least in my opinion,
they're just,

172
00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:07.850
they're talking about their skin color,
that they're not under a different race.

173
00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:10.930
I think that's wrong.
Yeah.
But um,
as like,

174
00:11:10.931 --> 00:11:12.590
and we were talking about it as a proud black person,

175
00:11:12.591 --> 00:11:15.190
they'd been oppressed that a lot of their culture was stolen from them.

176
00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:18.380
And then a lot of reasons that I don't like,
proud to be white.

177
00:11:18.381 --> 00:11:22.190
It's because it has the,
the Nazis used it,

178
00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:26.330
the KKK used it.
I don't want to be associated with any of those things,

179
00:11:26.331 --> 00:11:29.720
so I'm just going to completely stay away from that.

180
00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:34.550
<v 0>Sure.
I'm not proud of like what my culture is done,
but at the same time,</v>

181
00:11:34.551 --> 00:11:37.910
like I would not want to be anything else if I had to choose another race.

182
00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:39.110
I don't know what I would be.

183
00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:43.370
I'm okay with where I am even though I'm getting backlash about being white.

184
00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.960
I was waiting on the food question.
Do you like Starbucks?

185
00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:58.090
