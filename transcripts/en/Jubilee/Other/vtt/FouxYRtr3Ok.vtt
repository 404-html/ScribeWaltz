1
00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:06.200
Good to know.
Okay.
I just let go of like half.
I think so.

2
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.160
Well I'm all nervous.

3
00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.360
<v 2>Tell us about your experience on dating apps.
Um,</v>

4
00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.950
<v 3>a string of first dates and by dates I mean like grab a beer and then you kind</v>

5
00:00:30.071 --> 00:00:31.250
of talk a little bit,

6
00:00:31.251 --> 00:00:34.820
start to ghost each other and then he's like the first one to watch me on

7
00:00:34.821 --> 00:00:36.950
Instagram and that's it.
And then you never talk again.

8
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.400
It's weird going from a life of dating apps to it being in person.

9
00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.070
So I'm a little nervous but like excited,
nervous.

10
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.480
<v 0>Ooh,
I can hear that.</v>

11
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.960
Sub dudes.
Oh God.
Okay.

12
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.883
Yeah,

13
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.690
<v 2>no.
All right.
Again.</v>

14
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:24.340
<v 0>Oh sorry.</v>

15
00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.520
That was so awkward.

16
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:09.670
<v 1>Okay.</v>

17
00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:10.503
<v 2>You doesn't matter.</v>

18
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.160
You are on a dating app and you would swipe and no,

19
00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:16.480
please leave now.

20
00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.100
<v 0>Oh
No.</v>

21
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.090
Okay.
I just let go of like half of you.

22
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.950

30
00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.990
It sounds really boring,

Sorry.
Should I say it with a smile?

31
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.910
It's got the rock and roll hall of fame.

32
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.470
You were kind of funny earlier and like half circle.

33
00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.230
My sense of humor as a defense mechanism.

34
00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.870
The to help you wanted your kids to make varsity.
Yes.

35
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.240

37
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.540
I love the office.
If that's a hobby,

38
00:03:34.541 --> 00:03:35.374
I noticed your cross.

39
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.450
I'm still trying to look for a church right now since I'm like,

40
00:03:38.451 --> 00:03:41.530

42
00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:49.600
I have a son who's 18 months.
I mean I kinda got catfished ones,

43
00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.650
but like by a completely different person or they just didn't look the same.

44
00:03:53.651 --> 00:03:56.800
She just nothing like her,
like her pictures.

45
00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.380
I don't know what climate these girls,
girls,

46
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.580
it's filters magicians and like really into movies.

47
00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.800
Like I'm a community like acting.
That's awesome.
Okay.
This is important.

48
00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.540
Top three movies though.
Network.
Okay.

49
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.850
Independence Day.
Okay.
Lion Ching.
Okay.
Those are three completely.
Okay.

50
00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.230
Gotcha.
They're very connected flanking.

51
00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:24.980
It was nice to meet you.
It was really nice.

52
00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.980
Was Nice to meet you.

53
00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.980
It was nice to meet you
too tall.

54
00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.880
<v 3>Crazy though,
regardless of who I talked to it was,</v>

55
00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.460
there was always something in common that was really cool.

56
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.840
<v 4>Follow up with um,</v>

57
00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.420
<v 0>right.</v>

58
00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:51.380
<v 3>Don't think so.
Is that bad?
No.</v>

59
00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.580
Um,
I think I had really enjoyed them all as people and I,

60
00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.760
I picked them all because I do find some part of them attractive,

61
00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:03.230
but I just didn't feel like that all around connection that I was hoping for.

62
00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.300
I think I need to put myself out there more.

63
00:05:05.301 --> 00:05:07.940
I think I'm more of the person that's like,
I'm too busy.

64
00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:11.330
Let's wait till it happens.
So maybe that's something I need to do.

65
00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:16.810
It'll just be less of a priority using apps and more of like inner actions with

66
00:05:17.451 --> 00:05:18.260
people.

67
00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:22.430
So I'm just going to lay off the apps for a little bit because even in person

68
00:05:22.431 --> 00:05:25.040
that was hard,
like that was rough.

69
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.070
<v 2>Thank you.
Oh Man.</v>

70
00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:32.330
<v 0>Okay.</v>
