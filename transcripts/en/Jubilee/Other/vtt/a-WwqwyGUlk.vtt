1
00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:01.313
No,

2
00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.730
I just awkwardly walk around the party until I make eye contact with somebody.

3
00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.450
Translates on camera.
Like I don't want somebody to say no,

4
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:14.363
you know,

5
00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.340
cuddle party.
From what I've heard,
it's not okay.
This is what Google says.

6
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.450
I got a cuddle party.

7
00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.560
Isn't event design with the intention of allowing people to experience nonsexual

8
00:00:47.561 --> 00:00:52.030
group physical intimacy through cuddling?
Yeah.
That's what we're doing today.

9
00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.920
That's the way,
yeah.
It's not going to get sexual.
Uh,
but like,
dude,

10
00:00:56.921 --> 00:01:01.150
come on.
It's like a lot of people cuddling.
I Dunno.
I Dunno.
All right,

11
00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:06.780
let's do it.
Don't let God,
let's do it.
What's up guys?

12
00:01:06.781 --> 00:01:10.120
I'm a Mario and I'm Paulo.
Our slogan at Jubilee is lived greater.

13
00:01:10.121 --> 00:01:13.080
So we decided to jump on the road trip for the next eight days.

14
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.250
We're going to face our fears,

15
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.370
do things we've never done and meet new people to explore what living greater

16
00:01:17.371 --> 00:01:19.950
actually mean.
This is the living greater series.

17
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.113
<v 2>Okay.</v>

18
00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.040
<v 0>I think it's this place.
Yeah.
Hello.</v>

19
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.230
Excuse me.
Or we're in the right spot.

20
00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.500
This is the area where the workshop and we'll be okay.
And the cuddling,

21
00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.820
name,
tags,
snacks,
bathroom at the end of the hall.

22
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.060
And then you said there was like a changing place.
Yeah,

23
00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.540
we're about change in the bathroom.

24
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.660
<v 3>Oh,
by some cute pajamas.
I don't really,</v>

25
00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.100
yeah,
I think what is a cuddle party?
For me,

26
00:01:58.101 --> 00:02:01.850
cuddle party was the gift that gave me back the gift of my voice and like I have

27
00:02:01.851 --> 00:02:05.480
my voice taken away at a very early age and as you sit and cuddle party,

28
00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.530
then they start sharing about rules and one of the rules is really getting you

29
00:02:09.531 --> 00:02:12.590
to ask permission and get a verbal yes before touching people.

30
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.640
So the whole Kodo party workshop part is about teaching you how to ask for the

31
00:02:16.641 --> 00:02:19.640
things you want and to stop feeling guilty about saying no for the things you

32
00:02:19.641 --> 00:02:23.180
don't.
And then practicing it sounds super powerful.
Yeah.

33
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.120
<v 0>Yeah.
All right,
well let's do it.
Y'All ready?
Yeah.</v>

34
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.460
Should we do like a cuddle party?
I don't know how to start a cuddle party.
One,

35
00:02:29.461 --> 00:02:31.140
two,
three,
one,
two,
three.

36
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.310
Come on in.
Come find a place to sit down.

37
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.760
My name is Adam and I'm here because I really love this work.

38
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.590
I imagine a world where the culture is consent.

39
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.030
My question is,

40
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.870
what in the world were you thinking when you decided to come out here tonight?

41
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.310
<v 3>My name is Dane and I'm here for growth.
My name is Paris,</v>

42
00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.500
often openness.

43
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.800
I'm Paulo and I'm here for the experience and I hear for understanding.

44
00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.600
Oh beautiful.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Let's see.
Did we get everybody?

45
00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.550
<v 1>Hi,
my name's James.
I guess I'm here to film it.</v>

46
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.200
<v 3>We're going to invite you for tonight to try on the concept.</v>

47
00:03:20.201 --> 00:03:24.430
What if there's no such thing as rejection and every time that word bubbled up

48
00:03:24.431 --> 00:03:28.150
for you,
what if you replaced it with the word redirection?

49
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.320
So really go ask for the things you want and say no to the things that you
don't,

50
00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.130
so you can really have an amazing cuddle party we're got,
okay.

51
00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:42.730
<v 1>That's the thing.
I don't know what</v>

52
00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:54.050
I'm allowed to ask them and to like,
I don't want somebody to say no.
All right,

53
00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.410
I'm going to,
I guess I gotta go for it.

54
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.960
I don't want to like interject like excuse me,
I was on.
All right.

55
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.890
You just have to go with all right here.
Here's the,

56
00:04:08.891 --> 00:04:10.190
here's the challenge for us right now.
Okay.

57
00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.230
We both have to go find somebody right now and ask them to do something with us.

58
00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.320
Okay.
Alright.
Right,
right.
Hopefully Paul is the one that gets rejected

59
00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.230
and I translates on camera

60
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.600
cause I think we're so accustomed to not want to get rejected or you know that's

61
00:04:30.861 --> 00:04:33.910
the hard part.
Being able to say no,

62
00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:39.570
it's not a defining events and so I have to remind us that we're not defined by

63
00:04:41.051 --> 00:04:46.051
whether someone's yes or no in the new world so that because we are inherently,

64
00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:51.400
what if you are inherently,
I just wish I could like take you around,

65
00:04:51.401 --> 00:04:56.230
but you're my shoulder whispering in my ear and tell me how amazing I've been

66
00:04:56.231 --> 00:04:58.910
thinking of actually using an app,
but what I do,
wow.

67
00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:04.120
You know what I'm going to do?
Oh sorry.
Excuse me.

68
00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.630
Would you like to go talk in the color green or I don't know what that room is

69
00:05:07.631 --> 00:05:12.620
called a bit.
Cool.
Well,
I actually have two.
Um,

70
00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.530
is that okay if you do?
I like in 10 minutes.
Yeah,
that's fine.

71
00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.420
You want me to come back and ask you or come back to it?
Okay,
cool.
Sound good.

72
00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:30.790
I have two grandchildren and I want the world that they live in to be a more

73
00:05:30.911 --> 00:05:32.920
peaceful,
consensual,

74
00:05:32.921 --> 00:05:36.640
loving place where strangers can talk to each other.

75
00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:43.000
Sure.
Hugs.
And we want to leave people with that feeling.
It's like,
yeah,

76
00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:48.060
I want more of this and I want more of this feeling in my life all the time.

77
00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:55.330
It's fun.
It's really fun.
Just cuddling with everyone.

78
00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:59.430
Letting go a little.
I think I still have a little bit of inhibitions,

79
00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:03.770
but I'll start with the slow and they open up their doors and bring down the

80
00:06:03.771 --> 00:06:07.410
walls,
you know?
Uh,

81
00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.960
you can definitely give me a back massage.
Yeah.
Yes.
Oh good.
Good.

82
00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:12.560
This is the other,
uh,

83
00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:17.950
it's really not about physicality,
you know what I mean?
Like it's,

84
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:22.280
it's not about what I think that this is attractive because it's about

85
00:06:22.281 --> 00:06:26.600
connection,
right?
So sometimes it can just leave it like eye gazing,
hand holding.

86
00:06:26.601 --> 00:06:30.200
And it's like all of a sudden you really feel good with this.

87
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.130
Can we do eye gazing right now?
Sure.
All right.

88
00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:34.560
Do you mind turning on my last name?
Yeah,
sure.
All right.

89
00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:46.953
Correct.

90
00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:08.790
When I heard cuddle party,
we're going to do this like what is this?

91
00:07:08.791 --> 00:07:12.630
But then coming here and meeting you guys are going through this.
It's,

92
00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:16.680
it's now I understand why people come here now.

93
00:07:16.681 --> 00:07:21.570
I understand why this exists,
why people feel a connection to this,
you know?

94
00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:23.610
Yeah.
I love it so much.

95
00:07:23.611 --> 00:07:28.440
I look at a room and watch and see people connecting and then just like the,

96
00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:33.390
the sweetness of the energy which comes from touch.

97
00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:37.350
He comes from being authentic and really being in your truth.

98
00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:41.430
I think the authenticity that you guys bring in this.
Yeah.
That's awesome.

99
00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:44.520
All right.
I can give you a hug.
Yeah,

100
00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:46.440
<v 3>thank you.</v>

101
00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:53.030
Look around the circle and all these people that a few hours ago may have been

102
00:07:53.031 --> 00:07:56.790
complete strangers and now we're just strange

103
00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:00.370
<v 1>cuddle party</v>

104
00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:01.240
<v 3>every time.</v>

105
00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:06.470
Think can take a room filled full of strangers and you all feel intimate at the

106
00:08:06.471 --> 00:08:08.480
end.
That's beautiful.

107
00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:12.980
<v 1>Can
you repeat?</v>

108
00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:23.430
Yay.

109
00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:40.870
Okay.
You know that,
uh,
the girl in the pink?

110
00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:44.360
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah.
Me and her just had like a,</v>

111
00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:48.260
like a super deep conversation that I really wasn't expecting,

112
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:51.310
<v 1>you know,
going into it I thought,
okay,
we're just going to cuddle and like,</v>

113
00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.480
that'll be cool.
Like egg

114
00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:56.700
<v 0>new experience doing that.
But you know,
it just,</v>

115
00:08:56.701 --> 00:08:59.820
it's a setting where you're just can be open with people and vulnerable.

116
00:08:59.821 --> 00:09:02.070
And I just,
I wasn't really expecting that.
Yeah.

117
00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:05.340
I think it gave me a little bit more understanding that have,
you know,

118
00:09:05.341 --> 00:09:09.400
it's not something weird or sexual or something like that.
You know?
It's,

119
00:09:09.401 --> 00:09:10.740
it's much more than that.
It's,

120
00:09:10.741 --> 00:09:15.240
it's real human connections and just meeting people and being really like you,

121
00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:19.480
you know,
in front of other people.
I think it's more than just a coddling you.
No,

122
00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:21.630
not definitely do.
Yeah,
definitely.

123
00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:29.420
<v 4>You want to cut off?
No,
sure.
No,
not sure.</v>

124
00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:34.550
No,
I said not cuddle.
No,
I have the parts.
He know.

125
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:35.863
I learned that today.

126
00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:45.040
<v 5>Hey,
hey,
hey.</v>
