1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.940
I like that.
You're like very easy to talk to you.
Kind of funny.
I mean,

2
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.480
<v 1>I don't know if I was laughing with you or nothing at you.
Okay.</v>

3
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.650
<v 2>A viral New York Times article featured 36 questions that could supposedly make</v>

4
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.180
any two people fall in love.

5
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.260
We want it to see what would happen if we ask these questions to two complete

6
00:00:19.261 --> 00:00:20.730
strangers on a blind date.

7
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.870
<v 1>My name is Azariah.
I'm single like alone,
100%.</v>

8
00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.040
Honestly,
I could say I know exactly what I'm looking for in a person.

9
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.240
Someone fun,
adventurous,
outgoing,
likes kids.

10
00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.340
It'd be dope if she also loved God.
Ambition is cool.

11
00:00:38.341 --> 00:00:41.090
If someone that doesn't need me.
It's like a number one factor though.

12
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.120
The anticipation is like killing me though.

13
00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.150
It's like when you're about to go on a roller coaster,
any takes forever to start

14
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.853
<v 3>up.</v>

15
00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.470
<v 1>Hi.
Hey,
how are you?
This is interesting.
It is interesting.</v>

16
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.020
<v 0>I'm Nikki.
I am 26 years old.</v>

17
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.580
I'm hoping to find a best friend.

18
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.200
I think it's very important to bond with somebody.
Um,

19
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.080
and to have that kind of connection before even thinking about taking it to the

20
00:01:18.081 --> 00:01:18.830
next step.

21
00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.680
<v 1>It's like 37 different types of tea.
Is there a green tea?</v>

22
00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:26.870
There's a green package or the new lady for green baggage's down meals so I

23
00:01:26.871 --> 00:01:31.340
could calm my nerves.
You nervous?
No.

24
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.760
Am I saying it right?
Camera Male Cam a mile?
I think so.

25
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:36.200
I'm going to go with Earl gray.

26
00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.640
<v 0>Do you have a secret hunch of that?
How you will die?</v>

27
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.980
<v 1>I feel like I know for a fact I'm not going to die in a car accident.
Like yeah,</v>

28
00:01:46.981 --> 00:01:50.250
like 100%.
I've came too close to too many times.
I feel like God is just like,

29
00:01:50.251 --> 00:01:50.990
Naw Bro,
that's not there.

30
00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.380
<v 0>Well yeah,
I'm so messed up in the head.</v>

31
00:01:54.381 --> 00:01:57.300
I would think I would die like probably getting swallowed by it.

32
00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.530
<v 1>What,
what is the probability of that?
I mean,</v>

33
00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.690
I'm just saying I can't even see like it's so easily avoidable though.

34
00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.810
I'm telling you it's going to happen that way.
Nobody's car.
All right.

35
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.410
Is there something that you dreamed of doing for a long time?
And if so,

36
00:02:13.411 --> 00:02:14.280
why haven't you done it?

37
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.910
<v 0>I have this thing where I feel like since I was a loner girl,</v>

38
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.960
I just felt like I'm Sif Savine entertainer.

39
00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.880
Like I want to perform in front of millions of people.
Sing,
dance.
Like the words,

40
00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.020
I feel like I haven't pursued it.
I don't know why.
Maybe I'm scared.

41
00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.730
Maybe I'm just lazy.

42
00:02:33.731 --> 00:02:38.560
Maybe I just don't have the passion for it.
But,
uh,
yeah,

43
00:02:38.561 --> 00:02:42.570
I would say that that's the one thing that I know I think about condoms.

44
00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.930
<v 1>What about you?
Um,
actually I would say no.</v>

45
00:02:46.931 --> 00:02:50.590
Like everything that I've dreamed of doing they're like want to do in life is

46
00:02:50.591 --> 00:02:54.910
like something I'm working towards now and that,
that kind of,
um,
change the past,

47
00:02:54.911 --> 00:02:56.470
like year in my life,
I was like,
dude,

48
00:02:56.471 --> 00:03:00.670
like life is for living and I'm tired of like,
like journals or whatever,

49
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:01.570
or like a bucket list.

50
00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.600
It's like I don't want to have that and just like wait until I'm at a certain

51
00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:06.190
point to start trying to accomplish it.

52
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.540
<v 0>For me,
I feel like it'll happen when it will happen.
So I don't face it.</v>

53
00:03:10.541 --> 00:03:14.380
Maybe that's not the right way to look at it.
That's why I do it.

54
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.430
<v 1>I'm a big believer in like,
and like God's timing,
you know?
I think when we</v>

55
00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.140
<v 0>Jamaica we say when when minor plan got away,</v>

56
00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.390
<v 1>when men are plan got away.
Yeah,
no,</v>

57
00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.290
it's kind of like you're making plans in the meantime guys like wifing cause I

58
00:03:30.291 --> 00:03:31.340
don't know if I explained it right,

59
00:03:31.341 --> 00:03:32.990
but it sounds like something from the book of proverbs that

60
00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.570
<v 5>how she'd go to Jamaica.</v>

61
00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.380
<v 0>How do you feel about your relationship with your mother?</v>

62
00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.250
<v 1>My mom is like,
she's dope.
That was my best friend.
She,</v>

63
00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.310
she raised me and made me the man I am,
you know,

64
00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.460
she taught me so much and like my dad wasn't always in my life.

65
00:03:49.461 --> 00:03:52.970
So my mom was like their life and she found a letter.

66
00:03:52.971 --> 00:03:57.070
I wrote her in 2016 and it was like basically me saying like,

67
00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.400
I'm sorry for not listening to you.

68
00:03:58.401 --> 00:04:00.530
I'm sorry for thinking that I knew better than you.

69
00:04:00.531 --> 00:04:01.610
You're the best thing that ever happened to me.

70
00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.870
Odd is like super sentimental stuff and I reread read it and then she proceeded

71
00:04:05.871 --> 00:04:08.690
to show me a picture of me coming out of her stomach and I was like,
Yo,

72
00:04:08.691 --> 00:04:13.570
this is weird.
But yeah,
she so,
all right.

73
00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:15.560
What about you?
What am I doing?
Your Mama?

74
00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.960
<v 0>So I grew up with my mom,
not there.</v>

75
00:04:20.961 --> 00:04:25.961
Like I feel like I can count on one hand how many times I've seen her in my life

76
00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.160
or how many times I've remembered her there.
I don't know why she left.

77
00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.060
I don't like blame her.
It just kind of was like,

78
00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.690
my mom's not here.
My Dad is,
you know,

79
00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.610
I would go like years without hearing from her.
Sometimes I would,
um,
you know,

80
00:04:43.611 --> 00:04:47.390
call her just to hear her voice and she just be like,
I can't talk right now.

81
00:04:47.391 --> 00:04:51.600
I'm busy.
But,
um,

82
00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.570
it's kind of just made me think that if I do bring a child into this world,

83
00:04:56.571 --> 00:05:00.290
I would never be that.
And I love her,
but it's like I,

84
00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.830
I don't necessarily agree with being what she's right.

85
00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:10.040
The choices she's made,
but you know,
it's made me who I am.
Yeah.

86
00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.830
<v 1>I mean I just met but I think that like you still a hell of a woman.</v>

87
00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:14.990
You obviously you were saying just having,
I like the way you carry yourself.

88
00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:20.140
Hello woman.
Damn,

89
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:23.730
I don't like you.
Yeah.
You saw it was a question you played yourself.

90
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.810
<v 5>No,
it wasn't good.
It was a good answer though.
That was cool.</v>

91
00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:30.910
<v 0>Complete the sentence.</v>

92
00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:36.660
I wish I had someone with whom I could share that's about the thought.

93
00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:41.180
<v 1>An entire cheesecake from the cheesecake factory with cause like,</v>

94
00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:44.930
oh they cheesecake is bomb,
but I don't want them calories.

95
00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:48.440
Yeah.
Nailed it.
Yes.

96
00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:52.910
You don't want them calories because you know it's like a thousand calories per

97
00:05:52.911 --> 00:05:56.450
slice.
Three slices.
Exactly.

98
00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.160
A whole can

99
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:02.830
<v 0>of whipped cream,
extra whip.
No low fat.
That's how you have achieved.</v>

100
00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:04.660
<v 1>Sounds like that's how you have a heart attack too.</v>

101
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.280
But he's like die happy though,
you know,

102
00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:07.681
<v 0>I'm,</v>

103
00:06:07.681 --> 00:06:12.681
I'm saying if this is the one thing I really want in life and I had to Geeky boy

104
00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:14.803
that happened,

105
00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:19.480
I would choose a cheesecake and I'm just saying and me,

106
00:06:19.481 --> 00:06:23.350
I wish I had someone with whom I could share.

107
00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:27.040
I think it's just going to meet Courtney told the truth.

108
00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.160
I guess somebody could share life with.
You know,

109
00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:35.320
I think at the end of the day like you can be so independent and a man or a

110
00:06:35.321 --> 00:06:36.220
woman of your own,

111
00:06:36.221 --> 00:06:41.221
but going to the grocery store is way more fun with somebody who,

112
00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:45.580
you know,
going on a hike is way more fun with somebody there.

113
00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:50.380
So I want to know that I have somebody you know there cause I'm always there for

114
00:06:50.381 --> 00:06:54.970
people's,
I'd be like,
I don't question it.
I'm just like open,
ready Gus?
What's up?

115
00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.780
<v 1>No,
I do that.
I actually want to change my answer a little bit to that.</v>

116
00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:04.980
I can't do,
oh,
this is crazy.
He says without speaking,

117
00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:09.240
he's staring into each other's eyes for four minutes.
Like first of all,

118
00:07:09.241 --> 00:07:12.680
that number is,
I'll start the timer.
All right.

119
00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:14.933
All right.

120
00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:24.670
I'm up here.
Okay.

121
00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:38.060
<v 0>Uh,
that was very refreshing.</v>

122
00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:41.900
I really didn't know what to expect or who to expect going into it,

123
00:07:41.901 --> 00:07:45.920
so I'm kind of a little bit impressed.
Have you know how it played out?

124
00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:48.050
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

125
00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:50.720
<v 1>she's dope.
He's got good style.
Um,
she's fine.</v>

126
00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:53.120
She's seemed like she respects herself well.

127
00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:56.090
She's the type of girl you would bring home to your mother.

128
00:07:58.380 --> 00:07:59.620
<v 3>Hmm.
Ooh.</v>

129
00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:10.360
Oh,

130
00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:17.980
<v 0>he's very funny.
I kind of get a vibe that he's very smart,</v>

131
00:08:17.981 --> 00:08:21.640
like he's advanced,
like beyond his years.

132
00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:27.430
I could see me and Azariah chilling on a daily.

133
00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:34.763
<v 6>Wow.</v>

134
00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:38.160
<v 1>That was not four minutes.
It felt a little shorter.
Right.</v>

135
00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:39.540
I couldn't use breaking rules.

136
00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:46.920
Okay.
We'll be back.
All right.
You're going to come back.

137
00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:51.080
Come back.
I'm to leave and I'm gonna come back and I'll see you later.
All right.

138
00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:52.023
Do you remember him?

139
00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:55.850
<v 0>That was it.
Second day.</v>

140
00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:00.760
<v 1>Yeah.
I hesitated.
That was weird.
