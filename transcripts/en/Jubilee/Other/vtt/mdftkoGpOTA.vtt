1
00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.540
Right

2
00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:06.150
<v 1>crying.
She said,
can you eat pork at home?
I said,</v>

3
00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.080
<v 0>what's a good set?
Okay.</v>

4
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.953
All right.

5
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.590
<v 1>I'm Kathryn Garcia.</v>

6
00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.460
I'm 27 my name is Deanna [inaudible].
I'm 28 years old.

7
00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.040
I mean with gasoline for five years.

8
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.580
I would describe our marriage as a godsend and I once in a million opportunity

9
00:00:37.771 --> 00:00:39.100
to be with someone like Dean Dale.

10
00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.450
<v 2>Oh Wow.
They look like a minion.
No,
you're beautiful mania.</v>

11
00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.780
<v 0>Kathleen,
can you hear me?
Kathleen?
Ready?
Do you know?</v>

12
00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.980
<v 2>Um,
it was in Barbados.
We both worked on a cruise ship and I was doing luggage.</v>

13
00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.460
She was,
she's an entertainer and that's where I met Barbados.

14
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.040
<v 0>What was your first impression of her?</v>

15
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.360
<v 2>The most beautiful girl I've ever seen in my life.</v>

16
00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.520
<v 1>We were working on a cruise ship and I saw Dando and I was like,
oh,
he's cute,</v>

17
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:20.121
but I got to go.

18
00:01:20.121 --> 00:01:25.121
So then I ran off later that night I went into the restaurant and I saw him

19
00:01:26.811 --> 00:01:28.820
there in his Tuxedo.

20
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.010
I just like had tunnel vision on him and my heart was racing.
I was like,

21
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.840
okay,
God,
what are you trying to tell me?
Like,
why am I so drawn to this person?

22
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.460
I think he said that he was like,
Oh,

23
00:01:43.461 --> 00:01:47.570
who's this new girl on the ship and that he was shy around me.

24
00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.720
<v 2>Is that what you said?
The most beautiful person I've ever seen.</v>

25
00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.960
<v 1>How's your answer?
Yeah.
Oh,</v>

26
00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.810
the contract came to an end our first year of dating and I had to leave the ship

27
00:02:02.021 --> 00:02:03.310
and he had to stay.

28
00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.520
<v 2>We were in London and I was so sad because it's her time to go back to America.</v>

29
00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.780
<v 1>DDO had to work that day,
so he got on the taxi with me and then he was like,</v>

30
00:02:16.781 --> 00:02:20.200
I'm going to be late for work.
I have to,
I have to get out.
I said goodbye,

31
00:02:20.201 --> 00:02:25.090
my last goodbye in a taxi and we were both crying and it was just a horrible

32
00:02:25.091 --> 00:02:25.800
goodbye.

33
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.790
<v 2>I thought that that's going to be the last black time for that,</v>

34
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.940
like contract that out and get to see her.
I was so sad.

35
00:02:32.941 --> 00:02:36.150
I was just in the room like crying and just like crushed.

36
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.890
She felt the same way and she's like,
we can't say our goodbye like this.

37
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.190
<v 1>Went outside,
hailed a cab,
got in the car,</v>

38
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.150
<v 2>and then there's still traffic,
get off the cab.</v>

39
00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.320
<v 1>And I was crying and running in a dress and heels and then one of my heels broke</v>

40
00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.030
and I was like,
wow,
this obviously I really love this man.
This is crazy.

41
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.920
So I go down,
I run down the stairs,
I bang on the door

42
00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.970
<v 2>and I opened the door and I saw her.
I was like,
oh my gosh,</v>

43
00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:12.800
your hair.
And I just broke down like on my knees crying.

44
00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.390
And if that's not love,

45
00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.540
I don't know what it is and I know that I'm going to marry her.

46
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.040
That's kind of when I realized like,
wow,

47
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.140
<v 1>this is something I'm willing to fight for.</v>

48
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.990
I'm willing to lose everything in my life to be with this person.

49
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.950
So Dean and I obviously met on a cruise ship and there's this like stigma with

50
00:03:33.161 --> 00:03:37.480
ship manse's that it's usually just a fleeing.
And,

51
00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.820
um,
I actually had my boss bring me into a room when she found out Dean Joe and I

52
00:03:42.821 --> 00:03:46.720
were dating and she said,
I just don't think it's a good idea.

53
00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.300
On top of that,
when we left the ships,

54
00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:54.330
dino had to get a visa and he was denied and that was like the most devastating

55
00:03:55.331 --> 00:03:56.530
thing for both of us.

56
00:03:56.531 --> 00:04:01.531
And then we spent both of our life savings on lawyers fees.

57
00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.400
Dean Joe left everything to come to America to be with me.

58
00:04:06.401 --> 00:04:10.990
He left his family,
his language,
his culture.

59
00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:15.250
He had to quit his career yet to basically start from scratch.

60
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.100
And I'm,
I can't believe he did that for me.

61
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:22.590
<v 2>You only live once and I can't live without her.</v>

62
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:27.570
I guess when I moved back to go,
go back to the Philippines after my contract,

63
00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.400
I'll be with my family and my friends,
but my heart is missing something.

64
00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.760
I need to just lay it on the line and trust this love that we have

65
00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.130
<v 1>makes me feel like not guilty,</v>

66
00:04:45.131 --> 00:04:47.790
but I do feel sad.
Um,

67
00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.070
because his family is extremely close,
like mine,

68
00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.570
they weren't able to be here for our wedding day.
And that like

69
00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.540
that's the proof right there of his sacrifice.

70
00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:03.290
<v 2>They understood that I'm just doing this for love then it's hard,
but it's,</v>

71
00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.270
it's all worth it.

72
00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.930
I Dunno.
I mean everything's great.
Um,

73
00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.290
maybe just cause we want to have kids,
um,

74
00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.930
emotionally we are ready financially.
I don't think we're ready.
Uh,

75
00:05:21.931 --> 00:05:24.510
so I think that's like,
we,

76
00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.920
we both have baby fever is every time we see children or babies,

77
00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:34.080
but we need to be patient and we need to be smart about this because we want to

78
00:05:34.081 --> 00:05:38.010
provide the best to our future babies.
I think that's it.

79
00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.900
<v 1>If you asked me what's the hardest thing about my career or other aspects of my</v>

80
00:05:44.331 --> 00:05:47.510
life,
I could like give you a huge list.
But Dino's

81
00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:53.250
<v 4>my constant and my,
my support in life.</v>

82
00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.310
I don't think there's anything hard about being with Dino.

83
00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.470
<v 0>Have this thing</v>

84
00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:09.480
you said before that you had problems before.
Like,

85
00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.160
no thanks.
Trust,

86
00:06:14.161 --> 00:06:18.880
but I'll always be here so thick and thin,
uh,

87
00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:24.740
till death do us part.
I love Olivia.
I'll,
I'll,

88
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:26.383
I loved here.

89
00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:31.650
We're going to tell you why.

90
00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:34.963
<v 5>Uh,</v>

91
00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:40.420
<v 1>I can check phones off.</v>

92
00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:46.950
I just wanted to tell you,

93
00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:52.130
thank you for all of your sacrifices and for turning your world upside down to

94
00:06:52.921 --> 00:06:56.750
be with me.
And I know we talk about this a lot,

95
00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:58.820
but this really is like

96
00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:05.930
the best part of my entire life ever and all of the struggles that we faced,

97
00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:10.890
we've gotten through together and you've never once let me down ever,

98
00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:14.160
and you're the best thing that's ever happened to me.

99
00:07:14.161 --> 00:07:16.490
And thank you for finding me and thank you for staying.

100
00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:21.830
<v 0>I love you.
I'm going to kiss me.</v>
