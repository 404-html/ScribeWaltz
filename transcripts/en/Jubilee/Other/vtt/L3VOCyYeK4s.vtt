00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.310
<v 1>Cause if he's a Scorpio and you don't want a Scorpio,</v>

6
00:00:14.311 --> 00:00:18.660
it's like why waste your time get a Libra like,

So slow down.</v>

15
00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.850
Like if you're a Scorpio,
I'm not even into astrology either.

16
00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.850
All I know is that they're really

17
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.823
<v 2>mean.</v>

18
00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.720

<v 1>I definitely do need a date.</v>

21
00:01:48.121 --> 00:01:53.121
Somebody who's like down for Vegan food once in a while all the time.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.670
Mostly Vegan.
Possible.

25
00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:15.213
<v 1>Skirt.</v>

26
00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.480
Donuts are Vegan too.

27
00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:24.261
I mean,

28
00:02:24.261 --> 00:02:29.261
I really do appreciate adventurous sex just cause I'm an obviously an

29
00:02:29.451 --> 00:02:32.960
adventurous person.
If someone's down to have sex in the park,

30
00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.630
I'm like all about it.
Or,
or nine apart.
Cause there's kids.

31
00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:50.403
<v 2>Hmm.</v>

32
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:56.040
<v 1>Do we have swipe on our phones?
Is that how we're doing?
It's so fast.
Yeah.</v>

33
00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.900
It's your thumbs.

<v 3>Yeah.</v>

38
00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.360
<v 1>You know,
I really do love Brown eyes.
Like I'm going to start there.</v>

39
00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.430
We'll say brown hair,
black hair.
So they have to have brown or black hair.

40
00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:35.843
<v 2>Oh,</v>

41
00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:42.443
okay.

42
00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:48.803
Wow.

43
00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.080
This counts.
That's something

44
00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:58.640
I think so.

45
00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:01.040
<v 1>All right.</v>

46
00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.820
Are we on in here about Brown eyes and Brown hair and black hair counts,

47
00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.390
right?
Oh yeah,
sorry.
Yeah,

48
00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.230
and they both Brown eyes black and

49
00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.020
<v 2>I have one.
Okay.</v>

50
00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.940
<v 1>Yeah,
I'd prefer somebody.</v>

51
00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.010
<v 2>Ooh,
it's not religious.
Yeah.</v>

52
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.790
No.

53
00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:40.503
Okay.

54
00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:09.640
<v 1>I'm down for like,
you know when we're like senior citizens to get,</v>

55
00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:14.200
be like domestic partners.
That's the legal term.
But other than that,

56
00:05:14.201 --> 00:05:18.280
no.
No marriage,
no kids.
Honestly,

57
00:05:18.281 --> 00:05:21.200
no cats either.
But,
oh,

58
00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:25.450
I do want a house with a backyard to grow some strawberries.
That's all.

59
00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.973
<v 2>Hmm.</v>

60
00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:08.920
<v 1>Roll away.</v>

61
00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:21.200
Hey,
yeah,
those were all my questions.

62
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:24.340
That's that.
Let's go have sex on the beach now.
Nothing.

63
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.660
I mean,
that's what's really weird.
It was interesting.

64
00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:38.290
We're in 2018 it feels like we're definitely like going places.

65
00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:42.980
I just think like,
I know what I want and if somebody knows that they want,

66
00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:48.050
why not say it to manifest it?
You know,

67
00:06:48.051 --> 00:06:51.230
like people have said it straight to my face before and like,

68
00:06:51.231 --> 00:06:56.150
that feels right.
I don't know.
Like you're too young and it's like,
okay,

69
00:06:56.151 --> 00:07:01.010
cool.
I have no control over that.
Or like you smoke too much weed.
It's like,

70
00:07:01.011 --> 00:07:04.070
well,
I have control over that,
but fuck you.
I'm not going to change.
So

71
00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:06.970
why waste time?
You know,

72
00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:15.120
I do.
Are we in exchange that?
Yeah,
let's do that.
Okay.

73
00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.120
<v 2>My neighbor,</v>

74
00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:22.730
<v 1>I know,
dude.
No,
I feel like now we're going to run into each other there.</v>

75
00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:25.410
Um,
can I type it because I don't know.
