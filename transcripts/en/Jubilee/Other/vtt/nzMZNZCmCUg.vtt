00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.800
What do you think?
Uh,
um,

2
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.003
my arms,

3
00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.470
I'll have you know that I'm really good at lip reading.
Okay.

4
00:00:21.471 --> 00:00:26.000
Then I'll just talk like this.
My name is Peter Sundar,
so I am 26

5
00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.790
<v 1>and I'm Bethany Strobel and I'm 25,</v>

6
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.110
<v 0>seven years.
Yeah.
Can you hear what I'm saying?</v>

7
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:39.550
Okay.
You,
you can't,

8
00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.190
oh,
she can't hear anything.
Uh,

9
00:00:48.191 --> 00:00:51.160
the first time I saw her was actually on the Internet.
Yeah.

10
00:00:51.161 --> 00:00:55.060
I saw her on a website called the lookbook Dutton new and um,

11
00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.110
I think she commented on one of my pictures.
So I clicked on it and uh,

12
00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.500
I saw her and my goodness,
I mean,

13
00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.670
don't point at me and makes me nervous.
The first time I met her I was,
uh,

14
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.070
we,
we met for a photo shoot and um,

15
00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.110
we were just hanging out and as I was leaving,

16
00:01:14.111 --> 00:01:16.150
she offered to cook for me when she was like,

17
00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.600
I'm not going to let you to leave on an empty stomach.
I was like,
that's the one.

18
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.690
Oh,
my ears are ringing.
Yeah.

19
00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:24.340
<v 2>Okay.</v>

20
00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.140
<v 1>We were both doing this site called lookbook.
I liked his,
um,
outfit.</v>

21
00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.700
And then I think I commented or something.
I thought he was cute.

22
00:01:33.701 --> 00:01:34.750
I Dunno.
Yeah.

23
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.620
He came over to do like this photo shoot or something and like I invited this

24
00:01:38.621 --> 00:01:41.980
random guy to my house and what he's saying,

25
00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.810
but we had been talking for a while and I was,

26
00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.800
I was slow to like make a decision or like even think in that way.

27
00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.130
It took me a few months to like really think that,
oh,

28
00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:55.810
maybe I do want to be with this guy.

29
00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.993
<v 2>Okay.</v>

30
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.790
<v 0>I wasn't sure if she liked me or not cause I told her like a week before that I</v>

31
00:02:07.831 --> 00:02:11.880
liked her and she just kind of like,
okay.
And acted as if nothing happened.

32
00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.820
And uh,
so I just kind of like made the leap to try to kiss her.

33
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.980
And as I went in and she like,
Woo dodged it
and I was like,

34
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.900
oh,
wrong.
Did Not read the signals.
Right.

35
00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:25.573
<v 2>He</v>

36
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.560
<v 1>went in for a kiss and I was like,
Oh God.
And like really freaked out at first,</v>

37
00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.290
but then I kissed him.
So it made up for it.

38
00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.253
<v 2>Did you,</v>

39
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.960
<v 0>I dodged it.
And then I was like,
okay,
yeah,
Manny Castillo.
I always,</v>

40
00:02:42.961 --> 00:02:47.010
I don't remember all of them.
I was like,
I went in and you were like,
I thought,

41
00:02:47.011 --> 00:02:48.570
I always thought I made the first move.

42
00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:54.740
<v 1>I guess it's not really an insecurity,</v>

43
00:02:54.741 --> 00:02:59.741
it's more of a fear that she will be taken on like a really long job away if he

44
00:03:02.111 --> 00:03:04.330
gets like a big movie or something.
I don't know.

45
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.780
<v 0>She was the first,
um,</v>

46
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.810
I guess non Asian that I've had a relationship with and at first that was

47
00:03:10.811 --> 00:03:12.340
something that I was like really insecure about.

48
00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:19.500
<v 1>We haven't really gotten into like a really bad fight.
Um,</v>

49
00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.670
parenting together is

50
00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.400
<v 0>sort of difficult.
She,
she has a daughter.
So,
um,</v>

51
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.000
I think the hardest part is the way people look at us more than anything.

52
00:03:31.001 --> 00:03:33.070
Like we personally don't have a problem with it.
We,

53
00:03:33.071 --> 00:03:36.220
I got into the relationship knowing she had a kid,
I was 16,

54
00:03:36.221 --> 00:03:38.700
so you can imagine there were

55
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:39.761
<v 1>hard times,</v>

56
00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:44.440
but he was there like about a year after she was born.

57
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.090
And he's been there ever since.
So

58
00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:54.920
<v 0>she doesn't want her,
her dishes.</v>

59
00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.940
I always have to wash your dishes and if you asked her,
she'd be like,

60
00:03:58.941 --> 00:03:59.721
I'm working on it.

61
00:03:59.721 --> 00:04:03.590
I've been washing the dishes for the past two weeks and she has been,
but still,

62
00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.480
<v 2>it's like washing dishes.
I'm</v>

63
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.350
going to say that I wash my dishes.

64
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.720
<v 0>Yeah,
you do sort of.</v>

65
00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.470
<v 1>He's actually a really great dancer and I never really tell him that,</v>

66
00:04:19.471 --> 00:04:23.430
but he is very sexy when he dances.
But as for personality wise,

67
00:04:23.431 --> 00:04:28.431
what I find the most sexy is his honesty and trustworthiness.

68
00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:35.580
<v 0>I really like her shoulders.
I know why.
I know that's a weird,
weird thing to say.</v>

69
00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.150
I love her personality.
I sexiest thing about her.

70
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.830
The fact that she could do this stupid faces and doing little jokes like that.

71
00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.960
<v 2>She did.
He said it first.</v>

72
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:51.333
<v 0>I did.</v>

73
00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.570
I thought she was sleeping and I said to her,

74
00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.080
I think I'm falling in love with you.

75
00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.650
I think she pretended to be asleep for that whole duration.

76
00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:04.960
She don't want to say it back.

77
00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:06.370
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

78
00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.050
<v 0>And you admitted it like a week later.
I remember I said,
uh,</v>

79
00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:11.450
I think I'm falling in love with you.

80
00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:13.990
<v 1>Oh yeah,
I do.
Yeah.</v>

81
00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.290
<v 2>Well,
I didn't know what to say.
I know.
So you just present them to sleep?
Yeah,</v>

82
00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:27.270
<v 1>maybe I don't tell them enough,
but I have told him that I'm really proud of him,</v>

83
00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.390
just proud of who he is.

84
00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.700
We've been together for a really long time and I'm really proud of him.

85
00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:43.130
I've never felt this way about another person.
So he is my

86
00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.460
home.
Wherever he is,

87
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000
I'm 100% comfortable and I feel safe.

88
00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:57.770
Yeah.
Actually,

89
00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:04.180
I wish you would love yourself like I love you or you at least you would love

90
00:06:05.211 --> 00:06:06.440
yourself like you love me.

91
00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:12.850
I chose you because you are the purest human being I've ever met.

92
00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:20.090
You always make things lighter for me.
Whether I'm sad,

93
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:25.370
anxious,
stressed,
you're always there for me.

94
00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:29.000
I need you actually need you.

95
00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:36.650
<v 0>We've got so serious.
I almost cried.
I know.
I saw that.
I was like,</v>

96
00:06:36.651 --> 00:06:38.630
why you keep cases were just talking about

97
00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:44.830
<v 1>thanks.
I just said that.</v>

98
00:06:44.831 --> 00:06:48.910
I'm proud of you,
but I do tell you that,
but maybe not enough.

99
00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:52.000
Thank you.
Oh,
all I said was,

100
00:06:52.001 --> 00:06:56.510
I wish you would love yourself as much as I loved you.
Loved past tense.

101
00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:02.020
As much as I love you.
I love you.

102
00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:05.860
I love you too.
That's it.

103
00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:11.290
You could tell me all the bad things he said when we get in the car or you can

104
00:07:11.291 --> 00:07:13.660
watch it on youtube.
I'm not going to wait that long.

105
00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.740
<v 0>We didn't cry.
My mic fell down.</v>

106
00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:25.350
Thank you.
Thank you for having us.
