00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:00.750
You know,

2
00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:05.180
I'm on a campus and I'm looking at elementary school kids saying fuck that Nigga

3
00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.570
Dick.
And yet you're saying you want to teach them some kind of self respect.

4
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.913
<v 1>Okay,</v>

5
00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.310
<v 2>sure didn't know this,
but my enemy shooting,</v>

6
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.030
shooting,
shooting,
shooting,

7
00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:12.210
shooting my hands.
No,

8
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.240
no shooting.
No,
you don't remember me?
Yeah.

9
00:01:20.241 --> 00:01:24.500
I tried to show some love to my enemies,
but I should have stayed at home.

10
00:01:24.501 --> 00:01:27.080
Like I rather be jealousy.
Got You.

11
00:01:27.081 --> 00:01:29.910
Trying to get ahead of me Niggas kids

12
00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.720
when my numbers are low,
you put gating me,
he went out blow.

13
00:01:35.721 --> 00:01:39.880
You gon blow me like in candidate mode.
No.
Now you

14
00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:46.500
got
no

15
00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:49.263
trust.

16
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.113
No Shit.

17
00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:59.283
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

18
00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.650
<v 3>One time and marker.
That was take one.</v>

19
00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.520
That's going to be,
we're all,
we go way back to the marker.

20
00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.610
<v 0>Oh,
I was impressed with his moves.
Yeah.</v>

21
00:02:30.611 --> 00:02:34.950
And one of the problems it was,
I wish I could do that,
but all day,

22
00:02:34.951 --> 00:02:38.330
just taking that away from me.
I'm going to live it.

23
00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.930
You can live through me live through me.
Did you write the music?

24
00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.950
We're all the way.
Yeah.
Oh good.
It's real good to know.
Okay.
Yeah,

25
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.050
<v 3>I like the fact a lot.</v>

26
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.830
I liked your movements and your energy and I liked the fact that I could

27
00:02:52.831 --> 00:02:54.750
understand what you were saying.

28
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.590
Whereas so many young singers come up there and you can't hear a word of,

29
00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:59.980
well the message is they're

30
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.760
<v 0>trying to,
yeah.
So that was good.
Really good.</v>

31
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.820
Do you feel a singer has a social responsibility when he writes it and the

32
00:03:09.821 --> 00:03:13.690
issues he's trying to get across and how he gets them?
Yes and no.

33
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.720
I feel like the,
the singer or the artist has a responsibility to,

34
00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.790
to capture what their reality is and the generation I'm in now,

35
00:03:21.791 --> 00:03:25.780
there's this thing of everybody being offended and I think that can silence

36
00:03:25.781 --> 00:03:29.530
voices and do as much harm as people,

37
00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.050
I guess spreading what the public would describe it as a negative message,

38
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.670
you know?

39
00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.250
So who do you believe to be or want to be your primary audience?

40
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.560
The audience is like,
when I perform are pretty like mixed in general.

41
00:03:44.561 --> 00:03:46.240
Like as far as race and age.

42
00:03:46.241 --> 00:03:50.260
So it's like I just want whoever can relate to it to relate to it,
you know?

43
00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.520
<v 4>But I still want to circle back to the other discussion.</v>

44
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.760
It concerns me with some of the verbage because the young kids,

45
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.630
they're like tape recorders and they do sing all the words.

46
00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.350
Can I say words or say what I want to say?
Yeah,
sure.
Okay,

47
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.100
so when you use the word fuck or nigger or bitch,

48
00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:12.600
then you know I'm on a campus and I'm looking at elementary school kids saying

49
00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.310
fuck that Nigga v Bush and yet you're saying you want to teach them some kind of

50
00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.630
self respect.
Then when you use them and you say this is okay,

51
00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.750
that's like endorsing them.
So yeah,
I have a problem with that.

52
00:04:24.751 --> 00:04:26.040
Especially if you're a songwriter,

53
00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.940
<v 0>those kids are going to hear that when it comes to a certain guy,</v>

54
00:04:29.941 --> 00:04:32.090
I would suggest that you take the opposite point.

55
00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.880
They're going to hear a lot of negative,

56
00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.340
negative things from other places.

57
00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.470
They look to you and they respect you and I find that you can be respected with

58
00:04:42.471 --> 00:04:45.920
auction,
that kind of language without that kind of discourse.

59
00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:48.440
Everything you're saying is true.
You know what I mean?
Like,

60
00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:52.370
I feel like there's two truths we should look at.
Okay.

61
00:04:52.371 --> 00:04:55.370
What about life is making these people say these things?

62
00:04:55.371 --> 00:04:58.610
Like what do we need to change about society that's causing this language?

63
00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.470
Because the words you're speaking of,
they didn't originate from a song.
You know,

64
00:05:03.471 --> 00:05:07.220
they have,
they have a deep history.
I grew up hearing it.
So when I write a song,

65
00:05:07.221 --> 00:05:11.330
it's just comes out and I feel almost wrong just cutting it out on purpose.

66
00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.950
It's that maybe you can just decide when you need to throw the f bomb and just

67
00:05:15.951 --> 00:05:20.240
go for it.
But an occasional f Bob doesn't,

68
00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.660
it doesn't ruin it for me.
But if that's every other word out of their mouth,

69
00:05:23.661 --> 00:05:27.500
you know,
like come on.
But if somebody slaps your mom,

70
00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:30.600
then they're a bitch.
You know what I mean?
It's like it's,

71
00:05:30.601 --> 00:05:34.550
it's all context when it comes down to it.
So I definitely,
when I write,

72
00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:39.110
choose the context when I choose to use those words.
Well,

73
00:05:39.111 --> 00:05:43.250
I enjoyed your singing,
but what I would like to know is where I get a shirt,

74
00:05:43.251 --> 00:05:44.084
like that

75
00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:50.690
whole outfit that you have on I would wear.
So I'm glad we shared the same.

76
00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:56.603
Okay.

77
00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:03.420
<v 4>The reason I chose this one is it has the sunglasses and a smile because I think</v>

78
00:06:03.421 --> 00:06:07.470
you're cool and that's a cooler Moji.
Ah,
the smile is,

79
00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:11.340
I was bopping to the music for my sunglasses around because I didn't want you to

80
00:06:11.341 --> 00:06:12.570
see my look on some of your,

81
00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:17.030
<v 0>and I was like,
uh,
excuse me.</v>

82
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.790
I use the sunglasses but are like,

83
00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:24.200
you're a total performance.

84
00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.260
I picked up that one too,

85
00:06:27.261 --> 00:06:30.260
but there's a part of me that wants to give you this one.

86
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:33.110
When I found out that you wrote the music yourself,

87
00:06:33.111 --> 00:06:34.910
cause that makes all the difference to me.

88
00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:42.370
<v 5>You gotta show me Your Emoji.
Pardon me?
You guys are showing me right?</v>

89
00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:47.570
<v 0>I actually have never heard music like that.</v>

90
00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:50.720
I hit lead.
I guess I lead a pretty sheltered life.

91
00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:55.550
I would have kept all that away from my little children.

92
00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:01.460
I guess it really would be this one.
Yeah.
I'm sorry.

93
00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:06.530
Okay.
It's like an excellent performer thing.
I'll say that much.

94
00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:09.020
What I said before,

95
00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:13.820
a wink and a smile that expresses it well that we can can the smile.

96
00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:19.150
I really,
this is not my type of music,
not the music I grew up with.
Oh,

97
00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.160
no.
Big Door.
Enjoy.

98
00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:25.970
I did enjoy the fact that I could understand what you were saying and your

99
00:07:25.971 --> 00:07:27.690
energy.
I was jealous off.

100
00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:35.420
Thank you so much.
Think about what I said.
Thank you.
Thank you.

101
00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.520
Good performance.
Thank you so much.
Different.
Yeah.
Right.

102
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:41.580
Almost every generation has to,

103
00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:45.770
I'm going to find something that their parents could have jumped.
Yeah.
I think,

104
00:07:45.771 --> 00:07:49.450
I think always getting normal that for some time because they want it done.

105
00:07:49.451 --> 00:07:53.460
What do you do?
It's no worries.
Yes.

106
00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:59.390
<v 6>Yes.
Hey guys,
thanks so much for watching this episode.</v>
