1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:01,840
I was like a pretty chubby kid growing up.

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:04,000
We wanted like a girlfriend
and you're like, you know,

3
00:00:04,001 --> 00:00:05,530
dreamed volleys things
and we can do together

4
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:11,870
a viral New York Times article featured
36 questions that could supposedly make

5
00:00:11,871 --> 00:00:13,370
any two people fall in love.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,450
We wanted to see what would happen if
we ask these questions to two complete

7
00:00:17,451 --> 00:00:18,950
strangers on a blind date.

8
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:21,370
My name is Joseph [inaudible].

9
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:25,750
I'm a USC student who studies film and
television production and he's also 100

10
00:00:25,751 --> 00:00:28,030
mark ones or mark to,
nevermind.

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,820
I've been single for a couple of years
now and hoping to find somebody who

12
00:00:33,821 --> 00:00:36,520
shares my passions and who I
can do the things I love with.

13
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:43,493
Okay.

14
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:48,850
Hi,
I'm Brian Joseph.

15
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:54,250
I'm briar. I'm from
Orange County, California,

16
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:56,680
and I'm currently going to
school to become a veterinarian.

17
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:01,090
I've been single for about 10 months
now and I'm ready to start dating again.

18
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:05,860
Should we pick a flavor? Sure,
yeah. Let's see. What do you prefer?

19
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:10,990
Um, I don't know. I'll help
you out a little bit. All
right. For Asbury. Sound good?

20
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,530
Okay.
This is good one for you.

21
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,340
Is there something that you've dreamed
of doing for a long time and why haven't

22
00:01:19,341 --> 00:01:20,174
you done it?

23
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,200
Of the things that I want
to do eventually in life,

24
00:01:22,201 --> 00:01:26,370
the only one that I would at all have
like the slightest bit of possibility to

25
00:01:26,371 --> 00:01:30,480
do now would be to just
like kind of take off.

26
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:33,110
I'd really like to just do like the
Walter Mitty thing and just like,

27
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:36,680
oh my God, that's my favorite movie of
all time. I know I love that movie. Yeah.

28
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,740
That's literally what I
would like to do too. Yeah.

29
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:42,800
I always told myself as soon as I
graduate high school I just want to go

30
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:47,270
traveling up here. But that's one thing
I will hold myself to do for sure.

31
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:53,050
When did you last cry in front
of another person or by yourself

32
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,270
or both?
I am not too emotional.

33
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,980
I don't cry a lot.

34
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:05,550
I think the last time I cried was
with my sister when we were watching.

35
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,030
I think it was titanic.

36
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:15,100
I know that's funny but the only time I
will actually cry is if I get like super

37
00:02:15,561 --> 00:02:16,490
moved in a movie.

38
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:20,160
Yeah. It's funny cause I'm like
the exact opposite where I,

39
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,130
I don't actually think I've
ever cried during a movie.

40
00:02:23,131 --> 00:02:25,680
I've gotten like teary eyed and
clothes and I'll be like, oh wow,

41
00:02:25,681 --> 00:02:28,170
I'm not to cry during a movie. And
then it just stops. And I'm like, wow,

42
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:28,920
that's sad.

43
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,720
There was like a period pretty much for
all of freshman year when I was just

44
00:02:33,721 --> 00:02:34,650
like very bottled up.

45
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:38,100
And where's it going through a lot of
things just with like moving away from

46
00:02:38,101 --> 00:02:41,880
home. I would just be like in bed and
mermaid sleeping clear across, you know,

47
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:46,050
I just really like silently like tears
coming down my face. Um, but yeah,

48
00:02:46,051 --> 00:02:46,360
that was it

49
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,370
terrible here.
But you seem better now so that's good.

50
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,040
The last year was doing a good plane.
Yeah.

51
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,560
Ooh,
what is your most treasured memory?

52
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:00,300
Okay.

53
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:05,210
I think growing up we would always go
out to the desert and just spend like a

54
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:09,290
weekend out there. Like for Christmas
during the summer, like anytime.

55
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:13,310
And it was just so fun like being out
there because if you go out there it's

56
00:03:13,311 --> 00:03:16,490
just like pure silence.
Like it's so beautiful.

57
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,270
I think for me,

58
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:23,560
I think this was after like one of my
first dates with my girlfriend from high

59
00:03:23,561 --> 00:03:25,960
school. Um, and it was like the
first serious relationship I had.

60
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:30,250
I the only so far I guess, but same. I
was like a pretty chubby kid growing up.

61
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,190
And so I always like was like a little
Chubby, a weird nerd who will want it,

62
00:03:33,191 --> 00:03:34,930
like a girlfriend and you're like,
you know,

63
00:03:34,931 --> 00:03:36,460
dreamed of all these things
and we can do together.

64
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,340
But kind of thought that it would
just never happen after that.

65
00:03:39,341 --> 00:03:40,990
Like first date it was like,
oh wait,

66
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:43,780
I actually have that and this
is like becoming reality.

67
00:03:43,781 --> 00:03:44,740
And like I've gotten here,

68
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:48,100
unless one of those moments when you
just kind of feel like you have a good

69
00:03:48,101 --> 00:03:52,030
perspective of what life is and you
kind of understand how nothing matters

70
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:55,810
except for your personal experience of
life because that's the only thing that's

71
00:03:55,811 --> 00:04:00,610
real to you. Um, and at that moment that
experience was really good. Awesome.

72
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,760
Okay. I'm going to laugh. That's okay.

73
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:22,640
I'd say he's really sweet.
He is very intelligent,

74
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:27,620
which I find very attractive.
Honestly,

75
00:04:27,621 --> 00:04:29,600
my mind went all over the place at first.

76
00:04:29,601 --> 00:04:34,601
Then also I was thinking about pretty its
eyes work and just kind of focusing on

77
00:04:35,331 --> 00:04:36,164
that

78
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:44,450
green. Right. Or should I put,

79
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,010
I'd say that she's definitely someone
who cares a lot about nature and kind of

80
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:53,950
has a spirit of adventure.

81
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:59,130
She looks at her life is like the things
that she has in front of her as opposed

82
00:04:59,131 --> 00:05:01,050
to thanks Jen,
you've got behind you,

83
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:04,530
which is good cause I feel like I
probably dwell on the past too much.

84
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:14,980
I feel like I just looked into your

85
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:15,903
soul.

86
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,740
It's Kinda hard to over
power the nervousness,

87
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:23,860
but I felt pretty
comfortable at the same time.

88
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:27,940
He made really good eye contact and
did it make me feel awkward at all?

89
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:33,730
I definitely would.
He seems like he'd be really fun.

90
00:05:33,731 --> 00:05:36,340
We share a lot of similar
interests with nature.

91
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:41,150
Uh, that was definitely one of the
more unique experiences of my life. Um,

92
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,540
yeah. And there are bad on a
blind date or anything before, so,

93
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,650
oh yeah, maybe. Yeah. I mean I think,

94
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:53,660
I think it'd be interesting
just to talk more. I don't know.

95
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:56,180
I don't think there's
anything romantic there.

96
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:01,480
But interesting just to talk about are
similar perspectives on some things you

97
00:06:02,411 --> 00:06:06,600
need a little bit. It's like saying
that like to her. Yeah. Yeah.

98
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:10,590
I mean hopefully it's not offensive.
I mean I don't think, yeah,

99
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:17,720
so they asked if we go on a second date.
I'm curious.

100
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,460
First of all you said yes. So yeah,
I feel like I'm totally honest.

101
00:06:22,461 --> 00:06:25,860
Like I'd definitely be down
to to go and talk more. Um,

102
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:30,050
I like didn't feel like a,
like a romantic spark at all or anything,

103
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,220
but I would definitely like, I'd like to
continue the conversation that'd be like

104
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:37,300
definitely hang out and do something fun
like go to the beach or something like

105
00:06:37,301 --> 00:06:38,710
that.
That'd be really cool.

106
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:44,700
I feel like the difference between
friends and romantic interests is really

107
00:06:44,701 --> 00:06:47,820
difficult to define and that's something
that I've always tried to pinpoint and

108
00:06:47,821 --> 00:06:48,690
never been able to.

109
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:53,840
I would say that it was
pretty nerve wracking course.

110
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,190
I was really nervous,

111
00:06:55,191 --> 00:06:58,880
but it was overall really good experience
and I'm really happy it happened.

112
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:03,600
Hey guys, this is Jason. This is Ian.
