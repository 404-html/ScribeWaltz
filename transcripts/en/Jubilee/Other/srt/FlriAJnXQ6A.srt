1
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,460
You need to know, son,
I've always loved you.

2
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:15,940
I think about you constantly.

3
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:20,920
I know I'm not a perfect dad.

4
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:25,190
I know I wasn't able to give
you everything you wanted,

5
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,650
just one of my deepest regrets,

6
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,730
but I give everything I have for you.

7
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,290
I still remember the day you were born.

8
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:41,760
I remember when we play catch together.

9
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,260
I remember when we just talked
are some of my best days.

10
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:52,720
I'm going to miss some of it.
I have watched you grow up.

11
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:58,770
I've seen you in your happiest moments
was with you and your moments of sadness.

12
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:04,580
I know your tendencies to get angry
at times. She gets self centered.

13
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:11,620
Can't make me Love Talk Dad.

14
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:18,520
You don't need to stay open.
We just are. You always taught.

15
00:01:18,521 --> 00:01:19,730
You just want to know your done.

16
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,463
Yeah.

17
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:16,883
Okay.

18
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,920
Yeah.
Okay.

19
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:43,303
Yeah.

20
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:55,183
Okay.

21
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,730
What are you doing? Stop. Stop. No Dad,

22
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,143
two boys.

23
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:41,043
If I'm,

24
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:51,030
I believe in you.
Sign what you did in the past.

25
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:56,010
It's okay.
My love for you and not change.

26
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,710
There were so many sleepless
nights I waited for you.

27
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:04,900
There was hurting pain,

28
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:09,930
I'm sure you didn't see was distance
and silence that we both experience that

29
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,670
they can diminish my desire.

30
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,693
Si.

31
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,730
I've always loved him.

32
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,470
I never thought once I would leave here,

33
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,500
I'll never stop being
your phone to know that

34
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:43,030
and I want you to know that this is
what I want because that means you get a

35
00:06:43,031 --> 00:06:46,960
second chance to live.
The second chance to love

36
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:52,150
you mean more to me than life itself.

37
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,570
I give my life a thousand times for you

38
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:04,243
son.

39
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:09,640
I will always love you because I'll
never stop being your father and you'll

40
00:07:10,281 --> 00:07:11,420
always be my son.
