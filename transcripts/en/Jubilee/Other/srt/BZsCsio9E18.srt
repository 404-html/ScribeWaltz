1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,660
I was defiantly naked.
So bad ass.

2
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:27,250
My name is Maya.
I'm 23 years old.

3
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,260
Take off the robe and look
at your body in the mirror.

4
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:35,500
Describe the feelings
and thoughts you have.

5
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,520
I feel shy and exposed,

6
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,570
but I feel beautiful. You know. Look,

7
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,150
my name is Kylie Bamberger.
I'm 29 years old.

8
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,960
Feel Feminine,
different.

9
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,960
My name is ash.
I'm 32 years old.

10
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:15,960
Took me a long time to love this body,
but I'm really proud of it.

11
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:25,150
My name is Giovani. I'm 23 years old.
Yeah. My body doesn't look like eight.

12
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,793
Uh,

13
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,580
it's so awkward looking just
looking at your body to be honest.

14
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:43,030
My name is chance Calloway. I'm
31 years old. It feels weird.

15
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,080
I guess I'm a weird person,

16
00:01:44,081 --> 00:01:45,850
so I guess that's why it
feels weird being in my body.

17
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:51,210
I'm hairier than I remember.
I guess it means I'm getting old.

18
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:01,710
So, uh, do you pick or after? Yeah.

19
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:03,123
Okay.

20
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:06,650
Describe your hair when
you wake up in the morning.

21
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:08,600
Yeah,

22
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,520
so definitely a you question.
Well, it could be a you Ukraine.

23
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:19,010
This is what my hair looks like in the
mornings. Oh Wow. Yeah, man. So My, uh,

24
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,940
my morning routine is like,
I am surprised

25
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:25,450
I lost my hair when I was 15 years old.

26
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:30,310
I have alopecia is an
autoimmune hair loss disease.

27
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:34,450
I stopped wearing wigs when
hours about 20, 21 years old.

28
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:39,310
And I have decided to
embrace my hair loss.

29
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:44,140
I feel that body hair,
we use it to communicate.

30
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:46,600
We use it to identify,

31
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:51,190
but I don't think that
it defines who you are.

32
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:57,123
Hello.

33
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,310
Describe what you
consider the type of hair.

34
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,200
Oh,
okay.

35
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:04,123
Honestly.

36
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:05,280
Okay.

37
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,650
I love curly hair.
I've grew up with curly hair.

38
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,790
It's a beautiful thing because it's just
a mixture of so many cultures. My track,

39
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:15,990
like of just like three ex girlfriends
literally almost look exactly the same.

40
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:21,810
It's actually like, just, I can't even
lie. Like, do you find her sexy? I do.

41
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,770
I do. Honestly. Um, well,

42
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,730
my most ideal type of hair
would be whatever is natural.
I never altered my hair.

43
00:03:29,731 --> 00:03:32,640
I never changed it,
but I was never raised with like,

44
00:03:32,641 --> 00:03:37,620
hair become like makes you who you
are. Yeah. Um, so when I lost my hair,

45
00:03:37,621 --> 00:03:42,390
I was almost liberated. I always
had long hair. So like we're like,

46
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,100
like literally polar opposites.

47
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:46,770
When you said like the hair
doesn't define who you are.

48
00:03:46,771 --> 00:03:50,880
Literally for me because I grew
up with like long curly hair,

49
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:53,640
it like made me the man I am today.

50
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:57,360
My hair's been a part of me since I,
since I was born.

51
00:03:57,361 --> 00:03:59,220
I've never seen my hair short.

52
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,260
When I was growing up I always had
my hair in braids cause it was just,

53
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:07,080
it was just the more masculine thing
to do and it was really tough and just

54
00:04:07,081 --> 00:04:11,360
being called names like everybody
equates my hair to my sexuality, no suck.

55
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:14,370
That's pretty much the biggest
thing I had. Like I said,

56
00:04:14,371 --> 00:04:16,320
it made me who I am and name is strong.

57
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:20,250
It made me more masculine
and thank you mom.

58
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,280
Honestly for just not cutting it.

59
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:27,240
Okay.

60
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,820
What does a bad hair
day look like for you?

61
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,800
With the hairline that I have,
which isn't even a line,

62
00:04:34,801 --> 00:04:37,740
it's the Appalachian Mountains
back there. Um, yeah,

63
00:04:37,741 --> 00:04:39,750
I don't really have like bad
hair days. It's just like, Yup,

64
00:04:39,751 --> 00:04:43,440
I'm going to look like trash for
the next like week. And a half. Uh,

65
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:47,220
well for my beard it's kind of like
one side my beer. It'll be up here.

66
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,780
Yeah. And then everything's smooth. Yeah.

67
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:59,410
When I was first diagnosed with
polycystic ovarian syndrome,

68
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,320
I really didn't like my body.
I didn't like how it looked.

69
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:07,380
And I actually shaved my beard and was
terrified of letting it grow for a really

70
00:05:08,501 --> 00:05:12,670
long time and I was
miserable living like that.

71
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,670
Um,
but you know,

72
00:05:15,671 --> 00:05:20,671
it's soft and full and it's gorgeous.

73
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:26,020
It gives me more self esteem to be
able to wear it and be proud of it now.

74
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:32,120
Yeah.
Okay.

75
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,930
Have you ever experienced
a physical transformation?

76
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,530
I wish I experienced a physical chest
transformation honestly, cause uh,

77
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:47,300
one thing I'm super insecure about is
the smallness of my body calm something

78
00:05:47,301 --> 00:05:50,060
like my hair versus my body.
Like it's just,

79
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,410
I feel like sometimes our physical
transformations can be mental,

80
00:05:54,411 --> 00:05:57,920
if that makes sense. Like growing
up thinking like, oh, I'm perfect.

81
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:02,090
And then like, my mind switched, not
my body. I was still not perfect.

82
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:05,010
I was all of a sudden like,
oh, I'm perfect. Yeah.

83
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:07,640
Like that was one of the
biggest transformation. Yeah.

84
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:08,590
Up until now.

85
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,060
Thank you again.

86
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:19,910
So I found out that I was pregnant maybe
two weeks ago and I'm a little nervous

87
00:06:20,371 --> 00:06:25,371
because I never like reached that whole
dream body stage and I'm a photographer,

88
00:06:26,071 --> 00:06:29,400
so I just really want to reach it for like
one second so I can take some pictures

89
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:32,990
before.
Um,

90
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:38,150
but now I feel like I might not get
that chance because they will be stretch

91
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:42,060
marks on my, tell me very soon, but

92
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,680
that's okay too because
there's going to be,

93
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,670
they really can appeal.

94
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,540
Course it is.

95
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:01,410
Have you ever waxed any part of your
body and was it worth it if you did?

96
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,450
I can start. Uh, no

97
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:12,500
god, I have like bad experiences with
waxing. My mom like insisted, oh,

98
00:07:12,501 --> 00:07:14,810
we have to wax it off and
everything and like, you know,

99
00:07:14,811 --> 00:07:17,210
she just didn't want me to
be made fun of in school,

100
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,330
but it made me feel like,
you know,

101
00:07:20,331 --> 00:07:25,040
I was a freak and I had this huge secret
I had to keep from everybody. And,

102
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:26,270
uh,
you know,

103
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:30,440
one day I'd had still bullies and
like nobody really said anything.

104
00:07:30,441 --> 00:07:34,910
And I was like, okay, well let's keep
this going and see how far I can go.

105
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:39,740
Probably one of the happiest moments for
me was when I finally had kind of like

106
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:44,360
a small beard. One of my friends,
he's this big like Viking looking guy.

107
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:48,650
He just took me up in this huge bear hug
and he whispered in my air and was just

108
00:07:48,651 --> 00:07:52,640
like, you look beautiful and like
I love this and keep growing it.

109
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:57,050
I was like the real life changing
experience. Yeah. Cause it was,

110
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,890
who is like the first moment
that somebody accepted it,

111
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:04,160
like out loud and you know,

112
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,640
I'm like trying to not cry but um,
but yeah.

113
00:08:07,641 --> 00:08:11,570
And so ever since then it's just been
so much better and it's been so freeing.

114
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,150
I walked in the room and like,

115
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,510
the first thing I saw was actually
you and your smile and it's like,

116
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:21,060
I'm truly happy that you embrace
it. It seems too, thank you.

117
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:25,980
It's curvy as I am and it's Harry as I am.

118
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:29,880
I'm like,
I still find myself incredibly beautiful.

119
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,580
I'm really grateful for
how much I stand out.

120
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:37,500
I feel like I'm able to make more of
an impact. Um, just meeting a person,

121
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:41,010
um,
that I would if I wasn't so different.

122
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,900
I don't remember who made the last,

123
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:52,240
I don't even know how to
describe a physical state of
the person across from you

124
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:53,074
that you had

125
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,070
your smile. Oh, I keep seeing

126
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:59,010
it. I was like, oh my gosh, the keels oil.

127
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,650
It's really hard for me to
receive, but I'm, I've been
working on that. Yeah. Yeah.

128
00:09:04,651 --> 00:09:09,540
You, your skin, you have that wonderful,
that kind of like that glowy kind of like,

129
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:14,220
you know, pregnant. Is that what it was?
I believe that everything that's physical,

130
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:17,280
you know, it's tied also to like, you
know, the stuff that you can't see. Right.

131
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:19,470
It's, you know, it's fantastic.

132
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,920
So that that's tied to
something that you can't see.

133
00:09:21,921 --> 00:09:23,510
Cause I totally feel the
same about your smile.

134
00:09:23,511 --> 00:09:25,370
I feel like that's tied
directly to your heart.

135
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:28,123
Oh,

136
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:30,310
I mean,
I'm never really satisfied.

137
00:09:30,311 --> 00:09:31,960
I'm always either too
skinny or too overweight.

138
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:37,960
I definitely wish my hair wasn't
sua receding because let's be real.

139
00:09:37,961 --> 00:09:42,810
My hair was like a point of pride when
I was a kid. It's, I guess my body.

140
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:46,180
I'll be like, what else do you want from
me? You know, it's been giving me a lot.

141
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,260
Do you want a cow?
Sorry.

142
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:57,620
Share a struggle that you've experienced
in life that involves your body.

143
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:03,900
I would say I think all of
my body struggles would have
to be with my hair loss,

144
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:09,010
um, and losing femininity.
Even to this day,

145
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:13,240
I'm approached as saying, excuse me sir,
how can I, how can I help you? Yeah.

146
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:17,980
Um, every day while you're working
on changing what people think,

147
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:23,090
it's a struggle, but that's like,
that's like what drives me, you know? I,

148
00:10:23,091 --> 00:10:25,510
I like the saying,
you can't control what others do,

149
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,550
but you can control how you react.

150
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:33,070
I stopped going to the gym for a
long time because in the shower room,

151
00:10:33,071 --> 00:10:35,110
like I would have lady's yelling at me.

152
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:38,860
So I stepped out completely
naked and I was like,

153
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:43,060
is there something wrong?
And it was a terrifying experience,

154
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,890
but at the same time it's
like I was defiantly naked,

155
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:52,300
which like I, you know, I have
certain insecurities and things,

156
00:10:52,301 --> 00:10:55,570
but on the other hand it's,
I was taking the power away from that.

157
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:57,430
That is so bad ass.
No,

158
00:10:57,431 --> 00:11:00,950
seriously find like embracing
who you are as a whole,

159
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:04,250
however that may be is just so bad ass.

160
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:08,500
Some days it feels like you are an alien.

161
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:12,790
The most exotic thing
that anyone has ever seen.

162
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:14,363
Ooh,

163
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:17,670
some days the only thing
you Alyssa is sympathy.

164
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:19,823
Pity.

165
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:27,140
Some days you change people's minds.

166
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:33,020
I feel like my body is
as perfect as it can be.

167
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,350
You know when you're
able to accept yourself,

168
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:42,490
your body feels lighter and your body
feels more complete and I wouldn't change

169
00:11:42,531 --> 00:11:43,364
it for the world.

170
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:04,360
