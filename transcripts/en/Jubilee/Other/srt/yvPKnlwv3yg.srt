1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,850
Never have I ever thought
about having kids with you.

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:08,580
All of this is where
we're going. Um, Gosh.

3
00:00:08,581 --> 00:00:09,720
I wish we had time.

4
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:22,590
Wayne living
and Amber Dylan.

5
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:26,020
And how long have you been
together? A year and a half. Yeah.

6
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:28,843
Breath.

7
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,120
Can I go first? No, I never have.

8
00:00:36,121 --> 00:00:39,180
I ever pretended I was sleeping
so you wouldn't bother me.

9
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:44,320
Wait, how many times? I've
tried to think three. Ooh,

10
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,300
you've ever done that before?
One?

11
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:54,160
Of course. You really
surprised about that. Come on.

12
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:58,840
Hey, I'm tired. One for an
hour, I'm going to sleep.

13
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:03,970
Oh Wow. You're surprised
about that. I never knew that

14
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:08,190
I here. Thank you. Thank
you. Wait. Okay. Ready?

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,630
Never have I ever wished
that I had been raised

16
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,510
differently. Three, two,

17
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:19,910
one. Yeah, of course.

18
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:24,640
Yeah, always. But then, and then had we,
we wouldn't be here right now. Not Right.

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
But it definitely makes me think as a
child and looking back on your past and

20
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:34,150
have those moments, like what if, what if,
and I think most of us do, right? Yeah.

21
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:38,830
What if I had two parents?
What if my dad hadn't died?

22
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:42,210
And what if my mom hadn't been
cold and hard and unhappy?

23
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:45,760
What is my thought?
I had my father in my life.

24
00:01:45,761 --> 00:01:48,940
What if my mother was in my life
and my grandparents didn't raise me?

25
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:52,780
What if I didn't choose this path?
And I chose that.

26
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:54,580
We were just talking to my
brother about that today.

27
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:59,650
So I'm happy for how your lifeline
so that we can be together.

28
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,083
Hmm.

29
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:09,310
Never have I ever done
something to fit in? Three, two,

30
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:13,930
one. Ah, we're not coming.
Not Right. Not Lately,

31
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:18,070
but for a long time. Yeah.
No. Well, listen, if I cared,

32
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:21,270
how about what other
people thought I was doing,

33
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,970
I wouldn't have gotten out
of my 35 year marriage.

34
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:28,770
Yeah. Just becoming more of an
individual, loving myself more,

35
00:02:28,771 --> 00:02:33,771
allowed me to not want to fit into a role
or fit into this confines that society

36
00:02:33,991 --> 00:02:38,610
puts us in. I mean, even just shaving
my hair and saying, screw you.

37
00:02:38,611 --> 00:02:40,380
Beauty concepts. You know, like,

38
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,520
yeah, when I got all day,
I got rid of my braids.

39
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:48,180
I was free. Yeah. It's too,

40
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:53,330
uh, never have I ever wanted
to live in another country.

41
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,940
Three to one. Uh, that's right.

42
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:00,240
That's our movement of Bali

43
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:04,000
in a month. We're bouncing
to Bali. Yeah, of course.

44
00:03:04,001 --> 00:03:08,620
It's time to get out of here and all over
the world could get two hour massages

45
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:11,880
with a good tip for $14 and so ready.

46
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,100
Let's go.
No,

47
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,360
never.
Have I ever lied to.

48
00:03:20,361 --> 00:03:23,540
You knew this was going to be question

49
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:26,630
intentionally.

50
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:31,280
Is that like what it means or just push
the button and then we'll find out.

51
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:37,250
You have, I mean, we have, okay.

52
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:42,800
What I was thinking of just in terms
of, you know, what's going on? Nothing.

53
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,630
Uh,
yeah.

54
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:48,870
And then not telling you something.

55
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,580
I mean, I'm just thinking about,
you know, lying, cheating, stealing,

56
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:57,550
all the things that I've done in my life
and like how toxic it was and negative

57
00:03:57,551 --> 00:04:01,600
and now it's just so clear and
not like that. I don't know.

58
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:06,370
I can say anything to you and do you
hear me? And you support me in it,

59
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:10,070
but I guess, yeah, fight for each
other. That's the answer. It's great.

60
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:16,720
Never have I ever said I love you
to someone without meaning it.

61
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,590
Three, two, one. Oh No.

62
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:24,890
Like nothing I've ever done it.
I don't think I, yeah, me either.

63
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:30,430
Like being in situations where
it's expected or you received it.

64
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,780
It's like a, I don't return that
stuff unless I feel it. Yeah.

65
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:39,700
You're like, I love everyone, so it's
fine. It's not real. Like, of course,

66
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,100
I won't even tell you I love you when
you're not in the mood when I don't feel

67
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:46,930
it. But you always love
me. I always loved it,

68
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:52,190
but I'm not always feeling like
I know. Right. I always live.

69
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:54,950
I'm like Whitney Houston over here.
Just be patient.

70
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,720
Oh yeah.
Well,

71
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,720
okay.
You

72
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:08,790
ever have I ever wondered how I would die?

73
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:13,490
Three two, one, two fad

74
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:18,150
on one on one after one on one time.
Okay. Yeah, of course. How are you today?

75
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:18,993
They've

76
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:20,610
hopefully in your arms.

77
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:21,860
Oh,

78
00:05:21,861 --> 00:05:26,861
I don't know what some sad or give
me like just past together and it's a

79
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:28,374
beautiful way.

80
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,510
You got other why?
Because you got a lot more years after me.

81
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,990
I am a kid. Yeah. We can't do that.

82
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:36,520
Um,

83
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:41,440
I definitely would love for it to be
peaceful and surrounded by my friends and

84
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:43,360
family and like have a party.
Yeah.

85
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:50,180
Never have I ever been
disappointed in you.

86
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:57,813
Mm.

87
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,080
Oh, I can't be disappointed. I know. Yeah.

88
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:08,950
I mean I get frustrated and irritated
and annoyed and angry and intolerant and

89
00:06:11,681 --> 00:06:14,650
upset with you,
but never disappointed.

90
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,700
Never have I ever felt unlovable.

91
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,593
Hello.

92
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,120
Oh, I did it again. Okay. Three, two.

93
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,830
Okay. Um, yeah,

94
00:06:30,831 --> 00:06:35,831
there is the half of my life
I felt unlovable and then
I started to love myself.

95
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:42,650
No rarely these days because
you've showered me with
so much love and helped me

96
00:06:44,371 --> 00:06:46,110
to love myself. You really have, I mean,

97
00:06:46,111 --> 00:06:50,490
you've transformed me year
and a half unrecognizable.

98
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,150
My life is unrecognizable.

99
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:00,550
Never have I ever
correct.

100
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:04,480
Never have I ever thought
about having kids with you.

101
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:07,110
Oh,
this is where we're going.

102
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,330
Gosh, I wish we had time, but
maybe next week. Thanks for coming.

103
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,270
Thanks for playing.

104
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:20,150
Yeah.
I,

105
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:25,150
but not because necessarily I want to
birth a child in this world right now

106
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,660
because we could totally
birth and awesome being,

107
00:07:29,661 --> 00:07:31,820
but I don't feel like the call for,

108
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,150
I think we're birthing projects
then I feel good about it also.

109
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:39,890
We really just can't do that.
Oh you mean,

110
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:45,540
well I have had a couple of kids. Um,
have I thought about having kids with you?

111
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:46,374
Yeah,
of course it happened.

112
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,220
[inaudible] there's so much time we don't
have to figure that out and there are

113
00:07:50,221 --> 00:07:55,080
lots of children who, so many children
to be adopted. Sorry if it came to that.

114
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:58,920
I mean, you know, I love baby. I ain't
need no other babies and puppies.

115
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:03,230
Let's just adopt a lot of puppies in Bali.

116
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:07,290
Evolving weird barking
crazy dog and balding. Yeah.

117
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:12,830
And so ready to be on a scooter in the
rain at the U K I know this table we

118
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:16,940
said,
oh those are fun.

119
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:22,560
And I was never really nervous. I
felt really grounded in good. Yeah.

120
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:25,140
That's cause you're a professional.
Thank you. Like this. These,

121
00:08:25,141 --> 00:08:27,720
these are sensitive questions
and like it just shows us,

122
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:32,640
shows me at least how much work we're
doing and how vulnerable and open and

123
00:08:32,641 --> 00:08:37,290
honest we are. And so that just
feels really good. The work works.

124
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,160
It works if you work it right,

125
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:40,183
check,

126
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:47,123
oh,

127
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:52,190
you're still here. What
are you doing? Subscribe.

128
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:55,340
And if you haven't done that, go ahead
and check out the rest of our videos.

129
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:58,460
After you do that, you'll definitely
want to subscribe, but seriously,

130
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:01,280
get out of here. What are you
doing? What was I doing down there?

131
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:02,650
I don't know.
