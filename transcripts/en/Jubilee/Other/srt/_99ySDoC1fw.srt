1
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,330
I love my husband. I love him even though
he's snoring. Wakes me up every morning.

2
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:26,600
It's my daily bench

3
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,250
food network says you should
only get one item in your eggs,

4
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:57,690
but Louis likes everything in them
cause it's how his mom made them.

5
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,010
He calls it eggs with
everything I call it grows,

6
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,000
but that's how he loves them.
Especially when the boys

7
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:22,420
and I do all the laundry because my mom
told me that a man with dirty clothes as

8
00:01:22,421 --> 00:01:25,350
a man that's not loved by his wife.
Yeah,

9
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,010
I know it's old fashioned now is whites
are always white and all his coworkers

10
00:01:30,011 --> 00:01:33,790
will know he's loved.
He always promises to do it next time,

11
00:01:33,791 --> 00:01:34,930
but I'll never let him.

12
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,093
Okay.

13
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:45,750
I know he loves me because every time I
hit off to work I feel him watching me

14
00:01:46,751 --> 00:01:47,810
leave sl

15
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,073
uniform.

16
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,580
One of my favorite things
is my commute to work.

17
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:15,130
It's my time to myself and
it lets me clear my head
before the stress of the day.

18
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,293
Yeah.

19
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:10,070
It looks like you have c d or Fukes.

20
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,070
Coronial endothelial dystrophy

21
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,960
I can barely pronounce
is taking away my vision

22
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:24,030
and I will probably lose
my whole career over it.

23
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,110
I won't be able to scare the we anymore.

24
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,110
What am I supposed to tell him?

25
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,023
Okay.

26
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,370
I can't make it silly.
Anx with everything.

27
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:21,510
Have a bad dream or did you
all right?

28
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:25,283
Sorry.

29
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,280
The people he works with are going
to think I stopped caring about him.

30
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:49,870
Just talk to me.
Right,

31
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:56,830
so thing is going on. Something is
wrong. You're not talking to me.

32
00:04:56,831 --> 00:04:57,850
Please tell me what's going on.

33
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:01,600
Now when all I want to do is
breathe and walk to work alone,

34
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:05,200
I can't because they won't let me.

35
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:20,280
How do you tell the person you
love that you're going blind?

36
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:34,520
I can't help but think that I'm
becoming is patient, not his partner.

37
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:44,060
Maybe he'd be happy with someone else.

38
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:48,260
Someone who won't be a burden.

39
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,850
My wife is going blind you.
She doesn't want my help.

40
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:18,130
I want to wake up every morning
and tell her that I love her.

41
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,130
That's all going to be okay

42
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:25,683
of.

43
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,950
I wish I could do all the cooking,
but she says, don't do it.

44
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,020
She's even figured out the laundry.

45
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:55,590
Start going to work.
Taking the bus alone

46
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:02,440
stops every time to think about it.
Crossing streets of downtown,

47
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,770
even though she doesn't know

48
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:17,800
every day,
because that's what you're love is right.

49
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:21,850
This is more than just a feeling.
It's an action

50
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:03,220
Sicilian.
We'll never know which I do for him.

51
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,100
That's how I still love her.
