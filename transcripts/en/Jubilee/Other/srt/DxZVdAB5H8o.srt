1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,980
Julian, right? Julian? Julian.
Yes. You got it. Yes. You're you.

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:09,570
You're the one that loves to sing. So big
question. What is your ideal first date?

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,630
We, I don't think I'm the
one that actually he likes
the same but that's okay.

4
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:14,580
Oh Gosh. Oh, so sorry.

5
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:30,800
How do you think you get to know someone
without actually seeing them in person?

6
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:34,970
If it's through a conversation over
a phone, then you get to know them.

7
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:38,480
That's why I really love telemarketers
when they give me a call because then we

8
00:00:38,481 --> 00:00:42,720
can jive and have a great
conversation from there. But two,

9
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:44,090
when it comes to photos,

10
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:47,810
you just swipe to see who you
think is the most attractive.

11
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:53,710
And I don't think that's necessarily
the best way to get to know someone.

12
00:00:53,871 --> 00:00:54,704
But

13
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,673
yeah.

14
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:17,090
Hello, how are you? I'm good.
How are you? Life is a beautiful,

15
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:21,800
what's your name? And uh, do you
have any siblings? Hey, yeah,

16
00:01:21,801 --> 00:01:25,640
my name is Liz and I actually have
three younger siblings. Nice. Yes. Hi,

17
00:01:25,641 --> 00:01:26,241
I'm Victoria.

18
00:01:26,241 --> 00:01:30,590
I have two younger siblings that are
eight and 10 years apart from me.

19
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,140
And I liked to play tennis.
I'm Sabrina,

20
00:01:33,141 --> 00:01:37,850
but people call me Sabz but with like
a Z. Oh yeah. But you know different.

21
00:01:37,851 --> 00:01:41,990
I want to be different. Most of my days
I do jumping jacks sort of how you, hi,

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,720
my name is Diana and I love food.

23
00:01:44,721 --> 00:01:49,160
And what do you mean by you do
jumping jacks favor on this week?

24
00:01:49,161 --> 00:01:54,140
This week in and out? I don't
know the secret menu protein.

25
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:58,550
Burger. Lettuce. Yeah. Hello.

26
00:01:58,551 --> 00:02:02,810
My name is Jonathan and I love singing
in the shower. Are you a shower person?

27
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,130
I am a shy person. Are you morning
or night? Quick morning shower. Yeah.

28
00:02:07,131 --> 00:02:09,890
I'm a morning shower person too. And
then my name is [inaudible]. By the way,

29
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:13,520
being Hispanic, I'm Hispanic.
There's a lot of me.

30
00:02:13,521 --> 00:02:17,240
It's hard to be vegetarian in both
of our cultures. I'm Kiana like,

31
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,000
well all my friends call me
key. So I like that. Yeah,

32
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:21,470
I remember like key to your heart.

33
00:02:21,471 --> 00:02:24,370
That's like basically how you're
gonna remember me above. Oh,

34
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,830
I love how you said
that. Kiana. I love food.

35
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,920
I've told her brothers who
they like individuals that
are men that walk into the

36
00:02:33,231 --> 00:02:35,390
place where they want to ask
you out on a date. I mean,

37
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:38,570
they don't get involved in my business.
We're really distant.

38
00:02:38,571 --> 00:02:39,650
Are you close with their siblings?

39
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:42,850
Super close.
That's why I'm kind of like a child,

40
00:02:42,851 --> 00:02:45,460
but also mature at the same time,
but mostly a child.

41
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:59,380
Oh Gosh. I feel really bad. Um,
I'm going to do, uh, Courtney.

42
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:00,100
I was

43
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:04,420
unable to really get to know
her right away. And then Coco,

44
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,171
you know,

45
00:03:05,171 --> 00:03:09,580
I've dated people before that had rough
siblings and that usually didn't turn

46
00:03:09,581 --> 00:03:13,360
out right. So, uh, those
are the two reasons why,

47
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:26,880
um, ideal first date. Um, I
like things really super chill.

48
00:03:26,881 --> 00:03:31,850
So going to a coffee shop, going on
a hike and I love hiking. That's,

49
00:03:31,851 --> 00:03:33,660
that's exactly what I love too.
Yeah.

50
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:37,590
Well my favorite is we start off with
something small. Like a hike. Yes.

51
00:03:37,591 --> 00:03:39,450
And then if it's cooler than
that, then it's like, oh,

52
00:03:39,451 --> 00:03:43,050
do you want to do an activity like rock
climbing? Wait, I climbed till God,

53
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:46,080
you were joking. I really like
the beach. I love the water so,

54
00:03:46,081 --> 00:03:48,480
and I haven't been in awhile,
so I think that would be really cool.

55
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,700
I think the best part of
the day is just to talk.

56
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:54,660
So I really liked seeing places.
I like walking around somewhere.

57
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,510
So I do love art museums.

58
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:01,530
Do you like single dates or let's say
there's like a group setting of the day.

59
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,950
Ooh, I've never done like a group
day. I've never done a double date.

60
00:04:04,951 --> 00:04:09,630
So that could be something fun to
experience. Okay. Alright, Julian, right?

61
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:14,940
Julian? Julian? Yeah. You got
it. Yes. You're you. You're
the one that loves to sing.

62
00:04:14,941 --> 00:04:18,480
So big question. What is
your ideal first date? Yeah.

63
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:22,350
I don't think I'm the one that actually
likes the same, but that's okay. Oh Gosh.

64
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,330
Oh, so sorry. Okay. My I do first day.

65
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:27,210
I would love to do
something where we can talk,

66
00:04:27,211 --> 00:04:30,990
but also where we're doing something
kind of active like mini golfing or

67
00:04:30,991 --> 00:04:31,824
bullying,

68
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:36,480
I think anything food related I love
like anything like Greek or anything.

69
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:40,200
Did you know you live longer if you
eat Mediterranean food? So they say,

70
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,770
we really, sorry, I didn't.

71
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,150
So you're going to be able to
like live all very long life.

72
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:49,680
Anything outdoorsy is pretty
much really like my ideal date.

73
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:54,080
Sounds like a lot of fun
to do. That sounds fun. Um,

74
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,560
that's cool.

75
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:01,650
Wait, you're a vocal director. Do
you have law students as well? Yeah.

76
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,080
So you're a teacher teaching.
Okay. All right. Bye.

77
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,250
Okay.

78
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:15,110
Oh, they're, they're all really great.
I am. Okay. So the first one, yeah,

79
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,620
kick me out and I apologize again.
Is Brianna the energy?

80
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:23,100
I guess it's just different. That's
it. We're just two different energies.

81
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:27,990
I like Mclean. I like, uh, like chill.

82
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:30,743
Yana

83
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:36,010
I hope I, I hope I have picked
the right one. I, oh gosh.

84
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:37,640
Okay.

85
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:42,320
Liz, what is your deal breaker
when it comes to dating?

86
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:46,520
I think it's about extending generosity
to other people and giving them an open

87
00:05:46,521 --> 00:05:50,510
and safe space and someone doesn't
provide that then that's a pretty big deal

88
00:05:50,511 --> 00:05:51,344
breaker for me.

89
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:54,560
I want the person that I'm going to
be in a relationship or whatever, um,

90
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,810
to be able to give me the independence.

91
00:05:56,811 --> 00:06:00,860
It would someone who had like
low emotional intelligence.

92
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:04,930
If it was someone who that was way too
dependent on me and the relationship so

93
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,980
we can not complete one another,

94
00:06:06,981 --> 00:06:09,590
but we can come together
and build each other up.

95
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,470
I think a big deal breaker for
me as someone who isn't honest,

96
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,470
if you're not Vegan, I don't want
to date you. I'm joking. I'm joking.

97
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:21,980
I'm Vegan, but that's not a deal
breaker, right? You're like, okay, God,

98
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,060
why did you say that?
But I love how you placed.

99
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:28,350
That's what's so special about you is
that you love to play it back about you.

100
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:29,730
Yes.
Yeah.

101
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:33,600
Sorry, I'm going to hear it. Three.

102
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:39,390
Okay.
This is sound big,

103
00:06:39,391 --> 00:06:44,391
but Kiani and the reason why is because
we're here to like have a relationship,

104
00:06:44,401 --> 00:06:48,210
but I would love to be her friend.
I think she would be so dope as a friend.

105
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,920
Probably Jill as well.

106
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:53,923
Uh,

107
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:59,330
Victoria out. Oh God. Maybe
I do like Victoria. This,

108
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,580
this is,
you're pressuring me.

109
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:16,090
I mean, I'd love to keep traveling.
I love traveling overseas. Um,

110
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:19,470
but I also would like really
love to have a family someday.

111
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:24,340
So I guess those are two. What
do you mean by some day? Uh,

112
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:27,510
like have a family someday. Like,
well, how many years out do you think?

113
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,210
I'm probably in the next five,
whatever I'm doing,

114
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,150
I want to be helping people and I
know that when I'm helping people,

115
00:07:33,151 --> 00:07:37,290
I'm proud of myself. Oh my gosh.
I just made my heart. Oh really?

116
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:43,000
Yeah. I'm currently a student. I'm
a third year Undergrad, so, um,

117
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:47,580
right now I'm studying education,
so my goal is to become a teacher one day.

118
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:52,010
It's, Oh gosh, uh,

119
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:58,400
I think I'm going to, hopefully I'm
right with my notes. I feel, I apologize,

120
00:07:58,401 --> 00:07:59,660
but I'm going to go with,
with Liz.

121
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:01,903
God,

122
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:05,043
Hey.

123
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:11,350
I mean I've never been on a blind date,
like literally or Nice,

124
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:15,400
you know, so I'm a little, am I
a little, I mean a lot nervous.

125
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:18,040
I'm also really excited.

126
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:19,163
Would you like to see each other?

127
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:23,230
Do you want to see each other or do
you want to see each other later?

128
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,460
Like right now, right now. Hi Can we do,

129
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,920
we did that hog in the hug
was, I was like, oh my gosh.

130
00:08:33,921 --> 00:08:38,090
It's a little awkward at first because
it's like so much at one moment. Ah,

131
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,010
this is exciting.
This is moving away now.

132
00:08:40,011 --> 00:08:42,740
And then I'm moving back of
your socks by the way. Thanks.

133
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:47,240
And so I took a step back to
hopefully give her that space.

134
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,790
You could also show me the moves
that you have when it comes to, uh,

135
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:54,290
when it comes to a
climbing, climbing. Yes.

136
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:56,470
Hopefully after this weekend,

137
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:59,370
exchange contact information,
if she's down, of course,

138
00:08:59,371 --> 00:09:02,130
it's all about if she's willing,
because I would love to,

139
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:05,900
to figure out if there is chemistry,
you know,

140
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:09,280
based on just conversing. So, yeah.
