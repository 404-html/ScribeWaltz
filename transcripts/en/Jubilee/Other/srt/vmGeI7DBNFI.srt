1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:00,720
Okay.

2
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:01,553
Um,

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:08,520
uh, I think I would have lost
my dad mind if she wasn't there.

4
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:23,750
My name is Dia Frampton.

5
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:28,780
I'm 31 years old and I am an
actress and a singer songwriter.

6
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:33,520
My name is [inaudible].
I am 31 and I am an actor.

7
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:38,460
I relationship reading my shit.
Yeah, we're in a relationship.

8
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,553
Go all right.
Here

9
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,760
we were at Busby's,

10
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:49,490
it was super packed and like the Red Sea,

11
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:54,610
I look towards the bar and I see Dhea
in amongst the crowd and she was double

12
00:00:56,781 --> 00:00:58,010
fisting like alcohol.

13
00:00:58,110 --> 00:00:59,600
I was pretty drunk.

14
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,540
I was with my friend Uri and I
just leaned over to her and said,

15
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:03,500
that guy's really hot.

16
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:08,510
He had really big hair at that time and
I grabbed one of his curls and I kind of

17
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:12,860
pulled on it and then he turned
around and I think I just said, hey,

18
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:17,630
I think I went away. It got scared and I
ran away. You said that really cool hair.

19
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,600
Oh, did I? Yeah, I just said, I
said, hey, and then I went away.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,760
Are you saying I have cool hair and you
probably heard that a lot. I'm like, yeah.

21
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:25,523
Wow.

22
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,960
We went on a walk around the Silver
Lake Reservoir for our first date and we

23
00:01:31,961 --> 00:01:32,711
stopped at Ellie.

24
00:01:32,711 --> 00:01:37,711
Melanie got some coffee and we talked a
lot about our families and our past and

25
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:44,050
he told me so much about his family that
I actually went and wrote a song about

26
00:01:44,051 --> 00:01:44,500
it.

27
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:48,070
She immediately made me feel
very comfortable in sharing, uh,

28
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,400
things that I struggle with my family
to the point where she actually made a

29
00:01:51,401 --> 00:01:52,480
song about it.

30
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:58,090
Those are really beautiful song and
it made me rethink my whole situation.

31
00:01:58,091 --> 00:02:00,430
It was almost like therapy,
like someone who really understood,

32
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,260
he paid for my drink, which made me really
happy. I don't remember. You did. Okay,

33
00:02:06,261 --> 00:02:10,190
cool. I'm not going to lie. I'm a
bit old school. I'm from Utah and uh,

34
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:14,150
that's just how I was raised I guess.
So if I didn't pay for it,

35
00:02:14,151 --> 00:02:18,680
you would have been like, it would've
been a little bit of a little for me.

36
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,150
It was, it just kind of all
these little things piled up.

37
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:30,110
All of a sudden it just felt like love.

38
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,750
It just happened.

39
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:34,161
Yeah,

40
00:02:34,161 --> 00:02:39,161
she was performing with her band and by
the time I was already getting to know

41
00:02:41,571 --> 00:02:46,571
her and how freaked out she gets before
she performs and just to know the

42
00:02:49,311 --> 00:02:52,190
courage and the bravery to go up there
and to really be vulnerable with the

43
00:02:52,191 --> 00:02:56,420
audience through your
ability to express already.

44
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:00,910
You made me find my more as an artist.

45
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,570
It just seemed to be this thing that
built up until it was just there.

46
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,410
It was the one I like played basketball.
I mean like a three pointer. No,

47
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,760
you're like, that's so
hot. No, no, it wasn't.

48
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,890
He feels uncomfortable with intimacy.

49
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:22,100
I almost feel like he didn't
see it a lot growing up.

50
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:27,160
Maybe I've been kind of taking the reins
with that and just being very vocal

51
00:03:27,381 --> 00:03:28,214
about,
hey,

52
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:32,540
touch me or kiss me or kiss
me with sometimes and like
kiss me with your tongue.

53
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:34,560
Sure.

54
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,560
Used to be really negative in terms
of the competition and negative,

55
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:44,030
like if I didn't get
this thing or that thing,

56
00:03:44,031 --> 00:03:46,580
it's because of me and my ability.

57
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,870
Just kind of confronting your own intimacy
and being open about that and more

58
00:03:51,871 --> 00:03:56,871
vulnerable because I don't think you
saw that a lot growing up and not seeing

59
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,210
your own worth.

60
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,920
That was my main thing is your own
worth and how much she means to a lot of

61
00:04:07,931 --> 00:04:11,890
people. Me and, yeah.

62
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:16,840
And you know, you don't give
yourself enough respect. Yeah.

63
00:04:16,841 --> 00:04:21,640
There's always a lot going on,
trying to keep up with everything.

64
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:24,520
I always feel like time's running out,

65
00:04:24,521 --> 00:04:29,521
I guess as a female musicians or I get
scared that I'm getting too old to,

66
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:31,930
you know,

67
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:36,820
barely be making rent and I always
am trying to stay positive I guess.

68
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,520
And they put you through a lot and I'll
put you through a lot to the intimacy.

69
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:47,860
That's something I've, I've
learned with, with dia.

70
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:53,560
I didn't really see much of it growing
up. Yeah. Like my, my, my mom is deaf,

71
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:56,170
um,
very limited language.

72
00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:01,650
She has a tough time expressing herself
to me and my father very stoic from that

73
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:06,190
generation and they weren't
really intimate with each other,

74
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:10,570
so I didn't realize how
much that influenced me.

75
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:16,180
But I think the good thing about you
though is you're really open to working on

76
00:05:16,181 --> 00:05:17,650
things,
which is you're the,

77
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:23,040
you're the first person to help recognize
that or not be afraid to be like,

78
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,520
you're like this.

79
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,800
My biggest vulnerability moment
was all my dad. I had a stroke. No,

80
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:39,780
my sister texted me and told me that
that isn't a hospital and it's pretty

81
00:05:39,781 --> 00:05:41,940
serious and we are,

82
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:46,300
we were actually on the way
to palm springs when I got
the phone call and I told

83
00:05:46,301 --> 00:05:51,301
her that we had to make a u turn and
just a lot of stuff in the closet that I

84
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:54,900
want to bring out from our father.

85
00:05:54,901 --> 00:05:56,700
And um,

86
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,630
uh, I think I would have lost
my dad mind if she wasn't there.

87
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:10,640
And I'm just so torn between like yelling
at my dad and crying for my dad and

88
00:06:11,611 --> 00:06:16,110
she's like, you know, struck
in my back and calming me down.

89
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,980
I had a little tour on the east coast and

90
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:27,570
he flew out and there were a lot of
people that came to the show is very,

91
00:06:29,801 --> 00:06:34,660
very empty. It was a very empty room
was in Pennsylvania. And I just,

92
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:39,690
I actually started crying on stage cause
I felt almost embarrassed that the room

93
00:06:40,451 --> 00:06:45,100
was so empty. He kind of saw me
like trying to hold it together.

94
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:50,140
I was trying to manage all my friends
who were the musicians and make sure they

95
00:06:50,141 --> 00:06:55,090
were happy and pay them and get them
settled and then play shows and then also

96
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:57,700
will drive us to the next city.

97
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,030
Cause you did all that on your own

98
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:04,320
in the east coast.
I'm like that's so amazing.

99
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:08,510
No thank you.

100
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:11,440
Yeah I remember him,

101
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:17,010
hey were driving to the birthday party
in palm springs and all of a sudden he

102
00:07:17,011 --> 00:07:21,950
got a phone call and we just
turned around,

103
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:23,580
started going towards the Long Beach.

104
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:28,170
I remember just telling him
that if anything happened
to his dad that I would be

105
00:07:28,171 --> 00:07:31,950
there with him to take care of his mom.
I'm lucky I have a very large family.

106
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:35,070
I have five sisters that it would,
things go down,

107
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:38,670
we all kind of cup it and come
together and he doesn't have that.

108
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:43,350
And that's another thing that I told
him is that my family loves him and he,

109
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:47,370
he has five sisters too. Yeah. Now.

110
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,440
And they all love him.

111
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:53,730
And just kind of reminding him that
he's not dealing with this alone.

112
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,530
It's weird because I want
to be with him forever.

113
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:08,830
But the m word is just really,
it makes me feel like a kid,

114
00:08:08,831 --> 00:08:10,450
but it makes me really scared.

115
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,960
We went on a break for about
six months and during that,

116
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,830
that time away I realized that
I could not live without him,

117
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:23,680
that whatever our future would be,
I would have to be with him.

118
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:27,730
And it wasn't this kind
of romantic revelation.

119
00:08:27,731 --> 00:08:31,180
It was just fact.
I just knew that it was with Khalif.

120
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:36,590
I always think about this for some,
we always think about us on like a very,

121
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:37,430
you know,

122
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:42,430
like a nice little margin chic house
with these great couches and a fireplace.

123
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,280
And I could see,
uh,

124
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:50,500
the pool and the car outside and
we're just hanging out like we do now.

125
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:55,740
I always feel like

126
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:59,520
all marriages are going to fail and,
uh,

127
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:03,930
one of my friends get married. I just
secretly like there goes another one.

128
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:08,940
Oh God. Instead of seller
celebrating. Mm Love.

129
00:09:08,941 --> 00:09:11,000
I just feel like they're in fort.

130
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:17,410
It's too terrifying.
I mean I definitely,

131
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,730
I think about it sometimes,

132
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,500
like I wanted something different from
when I knew from Mike. My parents,

133
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:26,380
like I want it to get it right.

134
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:30,190
Just be honest and true as much as I can.

135
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,770
And you're on my person.

136
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:36,820
I feel a little smaller when I leave you.

137
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:40,363
MMM.

138
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:45,550
Cause I feel very confident,
very loud, very supported. You

139
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,600
keep me always looking on the bright
side of things and in the present and

140
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:52,480
grateful for what I do have.

141
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,040
Warm.
Where you at?

142
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:06,283
Oh,

143
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:12,740
I guess I would say home too. I was going
to say comfort, but that's Kinda like,

144
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,033
it's job.

145
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:27,410
Even made it through the
questionnaire and wheelie walkers.

146
00:10:27,411 --> 00:10:28,490
Marco wave.

147
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:36,130
No, he's getting, it's

148
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,300
gonna go

149
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:44,163
and you're left

150
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,070

and the step by you to sunflower,

153
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,080
