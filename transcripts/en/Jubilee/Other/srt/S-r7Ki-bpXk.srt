1
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:08,420
My Dad told me that if I made a
wish at 1111 it will come true.

2
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:14,980
Who was the last thing he taught
me before he got sick? Everyday.

3
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:18,520
I wish that he would get better,
but he never did.

4
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:23,330
Now I just wish that my
life wouldn't matter.

5
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,070
It looks like I've got you
free thousand hours. Lucky me.

6
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,880
Just do what you're told and I'll make
sure you're a community service doesn't

7
00:00:38,881 --> 00:00:39,714
become prison.

8
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:49,900
Children's hospital has must be
the judges idea of a sick joke.

9
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,740
What's a matter?
You don't like Tacos?

10
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,540
Those are not tacos.
It was a real taco.

11
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:07,410
Santa on the way home from school,
but it got shut down.

12
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:17,453
Oh shoot.

13
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,460
It's 1111 make a wish.
What are you talking about?

14
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,700
Have you heard of 1111 wishes?
Sounds stupid. All right.

15
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,460
Shoot yourself.
Okay.

16
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:41,950
You just made a wish. No I
didn't. Yes you did and I saw you.

17
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:43,983
What'd you wish for

18
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:52,140
my cancer to go away?
Do you think it worked?

19
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:58,950
I heard you have to make small wishes
first here. Just making stuff up now. No,

20
00:01:58,951 --> 00:02:01,560
it's the truth.
You have to get things warmed up.

21
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,050
You know what else I heard?

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,530
I heard you have to write your wishes
down here. I know you're lying.

23
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,090
We'll try it.
See what happens.

24
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:29,280
What did you do that for? Don't
worry. It's part of the process.

25
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,033
Yeah.

26
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,060
Hey Sergio.
Did you tell someone my wish

27
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:14,430
because I wish for real tacos
and it happened a piece of paper.

28
00:03:15,131 --> 00:03:19,030
I'm wishing for $1 million. Uh, hello.

29
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:24,310
You have to start with small wishes first,
right?

30
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:29,290
Well
maybe you should make another way.

31
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:34,291
Sha Kale.

32
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,250
Chris, Chris. Chris
was for, where's Chris?

33
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,380
We had to move from
upstairs to critical care

34
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:06,600
and you'd just see him.
I'm sorry. It's family.

35
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,580
Chris is the closest
thing I've got to family.

36
00:05:09,581 --> 00:05:14,050
I'm not just going to disappear on them.
I need to grant him those wishes.

37
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:17,350
Weight belts.
Now at this point

38
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:26,230
you made the last few weeks of Chris's
life. Amazing. You did a good thing,

39
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:29,030
but it's time to like

40
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:12,200
I've been waiting for you,

41
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:25,940
Chris. I'm sorry. Why you sorry.

42
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:35,030
Your wishes
not real.

43
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,070
There was me. I was finding your
wishes and I was making them come true.

44
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:45,310
I
know

45
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:52,260
much you want to get better,
but I don't have the ability,

46
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:02,620
have the ability to
grant you this last week,

47
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,730
every day at 1111 to me,

48
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,080
my dad told me that if I made a
wish and 1111 you don't come true.

49
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,230
I guess he was right.
