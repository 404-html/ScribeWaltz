1
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:25,670
Other people are like, oh, he's like fine,

2
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:31,940
if you don't show symptoms
and no one will know

3
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:35,660
if you don't want to talk about it,
no one will know

4
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,680
and it'll be hidden.

5
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,053
Okay.

6
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:03,820
The good days.
Other days for like I'm able to wake up,

7
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:07,330
I like a reasonable time
and like after waking up,

8
00:01:07,331 --> 00:01:12,331
like actually get out of bed and stay
out of bed and like go for a run and do

9
00:01:14,201 --> 00:01:18,400
the things that a normal
human being like can do.

10
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:21,243
Okay.

11
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:26,310
Bad days are when I get up late and I
say okay I need to get out of the bed.

12
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:33,040
And then they don't for like an hour
and then they get out of bed and then

13
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:39,840
I get back in bed cause I just
like feel like I can't do anything.

14
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:04,060
Today is August 7th so it is,

15
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:08,690
we are coming up on so
nine months. Yeah. So,

16
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,520
oh yeah.
Nine months.

17
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:17,670
It has been nine months. Like I told mom
and dad that my life was falling apart

18
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:27,770
when he was little. He met,
he was a pretty happy child.

19
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,093
MMM.

20
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:33,040
As a parent, I wanted to build
a cocoon. I want to protect

21
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:37,990
my child from all the
bad things in the world.

22
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,160
There's only so many things
you can control. Um, so

23
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,860
the whole process of letting go,

24
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,793
that's hard.

25
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:56,030
I think after being so quiet,

26
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:58,820
I can elementary school
and a lot of high school,

27
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:04,260
I felt like I had something to prove and
they always want us to prove my worth

28
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,250
like through school.

29
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,223
Okay.

30
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:13,550
What happened was I was like kind of on
the cusp of like a depressive episode in

31
00:03:13,551 --> 00:03:17,130
near the beginning of my fall semester,

32
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,640
stop going to classes,
start sleeping in too late,

33
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:24,730
causing like a three month
on depressive episode.

34
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:31,850
I remember Matthew Calling said,

35
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:37,200
I'm sorry I didn't tell you this sooner
and I'm having real problems with

36
00:03:37,841 --> 00:03:39,970
anxiety and depression.

37
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:47,800
And I remember wanting
to just somehow reach out

38
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:53,410
to my him a hug.

39
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:58,710
Yeah,

40
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:02,340
you're worthless.
How could you hurt this person?

41
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:07,340
How could you let yourself
get in this place, Mike?

42
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:10,900
The answer is constantly just
like, I don't know. I don't
know either. No, no, no.

43
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,330
I get it must be because
I'm an awful person.

44
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:20,170
He didn't tell me about um,
yeah,

45
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:22,503
hurting himself

46
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:26,520
directly. Um, and that's,

47
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:27,700
I think that's the scariest part.

48
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:35,420
Matthew's depression that I am actually
a free to know all the details.

49
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,253
Oh,

50
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:47,040
I had such intense feelings of frustration
and confusion and fear and anger and

51
00:04:49,121 --> 00:04:54,121
then you get to vent them somewhere
and I invented them at myself.

52
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:00,130
I didn't withdraw from classes
until the day before finals started,

53
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:03,280
which was the last day you
could withdraw from class.

54
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:05,183
MMM.

55
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,080
There was,
there was so much pride involved with

56
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,760
going to rice and um,

57
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,560
being a stray procedures
university and like being premed,

58
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:23,640
they're graduating in four years and I
had to like give all of them up for the

59
00:05:24,921 --> 00:05:26,570
sake of my studio for my health.

60
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,580
Depression is

61
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:49,680
an illness hidden from view
and silent in so many ways.

62
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,910
People don't want to talk about it,

63
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:59,730
but it's significant
part of our population

64
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,900
that you can treat and deal with.

65
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,710
It's not the yes.
Yes.

66
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,700
If you will ask me like
what didn't you like?

67
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:19,130
What did you do when you took time off
from like I found out how to be a normal

68
00:06:19,131 --> 00:06:23,780
human being. Again, I forgot
how to take care of myself

69
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:31,270
because I didn't care about myself
but definitely something I can say is

70
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,380
I was able to call and
called refocus my life.

71
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:46,010
My morning routine.
There is so much triumph

72
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,820
like I know I'm just like brushing my
teeth is like very mundane but like on the

73
00:06:52,821 --> 00:06:54,540
inside I'm just like fucking,
yeah,

74
00:06:58,530 --> 00:06:59,363
I rest my team.

75
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:05,810
Being able to just like do all of
these things and like know that I'm,

76
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:10,560
I'm ready also to tackle
whatever else comes down already.

77
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:14,780
Like kids.
It's so encouraging.

78
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:25,580
I'm really proud of
how we deal with

79
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:29,570
the hard time set shorter characters.

80
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,440
He's gone through some hard times.

81
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,570
You will still

82
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:48,330
have days where like nothing will change.

83
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:53,980
You'll have days where you only
thing regress and feel worse by,

84
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:55,980
despite that,

85
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:02,070
I understand that that doesn't define me
and it doesn't define what they can and

86
00:08:02,071 --> 00:08:06,060
can't do. And just focusing, just,

87
00:08:06,061 --> 00:08:09,500
just focusing on that next
step is how before it,

88
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,920
regardless of your religious beliefs,
your,

89
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:20,670
your, your personal
ideologies, love yourself.

90
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:25,410
So in terms of like where I am
and my road to recovery, like

91
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,150
I'm still, I'm still just getting up.
I'm still just like sagging to walk,

92
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,350
but like,
I'm still walking.
