1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:01,580
Okay.

2
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:02,900
My name is Donovan McNabb.

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:08,480
Since 2001 the Donovan McNabb foundation
has continued to spread the awareness

4
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:09,560
of diabetes.

5
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:14,120
Diabetes is something that's continued
to drastically terror the lives of some

6
00:00:14,121 --> 00:00:15,170
of our individuals.

7
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:20,710
The high percentage of of individuals
are passing away from their families and

8
00:00:20,781 --> 00:00:21,614
their loved ones.

9
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:25,310
We need to go out and find the
cure for this particular disease.

10
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:30,080
Obesity is something that
obviously adds into a diabetes.

11
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,410
Being overweight,
putting the wrong foods until your system.

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,570
I think we can eliminate that.

13
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:40,790
Diabetes is continued to grow over the
years with all of us come together.

14
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:45,770
We can continue to make a change.
Let's work together to end child obesity.

15
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:47,780
Let's invest in our nation's youth.
