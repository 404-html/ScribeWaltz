1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,620
I am transgender and like that's just
like something about me I felt like I'm

2
00:00:04,621 --> 00:00:08,120
proud of and it's like that's not the
first thing I say to someone. But like,

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:11,010
yeah, like, hi, my name is Tyler and track

4
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:17,760
a viral New York Times article featured
36 questions that could supposedly make

5
00:00:17,761 --> 00:00:19,260
any two people fall in love.

6
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,340
We wanted to see what would happen if
we ask these questions to two complete

7
00:00:23,341 --> 00:00:24,810
strangers on a blind date.

8
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:27,890
So my name is Skylar.

9
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:31,590
I don't think I can even remember the
last time I've been in a relationship.

10
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:36,310
A little more nervous now
that I'm sitting down,

11
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:38,410
I realize I've never been on a blind date.

12
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:42,650
I guess I'm just here to find a boyfriend.
That's the short answer here.

13
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,330
Hey, any, you know Skype twinsie twins

14
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,540
on the Louie. I am open minded. Awkward,

15
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:02,030
nervous for good. What kind of tea
do you lie? I don't really like tea.

16
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:07,490
I only drink tea and I'm like, and
like, like really bad. So I'm like,

17
00:01:07,491 --> 00:01:10,690
it's he snob so I won't,
maybe I can learn something

18
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,920
by myself.
No tickets alone.

19
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:16,993
Okay.

20
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:25,320
It's a hit. It's a hit s guy. You
didn't fuck up too bad. Or like

21
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,170
if a crystal ball could tell
you the truth about yourself,

22
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:33,020
the future or anything else?
Well,

23
00:01:33,021 --> 00:01:37,490
would you want to know if I knew
something significant? Well,

24
00:01:37,491 --> 00:01:39,370
anything really.
I feel like battle,

25
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:43,490
like shape the way that I'm kinda
like doing this awkward like thing.

26
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:45,770
I don't think I would want to know.
What about you?

27
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:50,720
I guess what I would want to know is
like whether I'm going to find true

28
00:01:50,721 --> 00:01:54,290
happiness in life. One day one of
the crystal ball says no. Like,

29
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:56,300
are you going gonna just going to be
like, well, I'm not going to be happy.

30
00:01:56,301 --> 00:01:58,040
So I'm out of.
So I don't know.

31
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:01,820
I guess I would rather know than
just keep living for nothing. Right.

32
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:06,830
Or is that like a very like, I mean for
me, I didn't look up for me, I don't know.

33
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:09,230
Maybe that's a little personal
because like as a kid,

34
00:02:09,231 --> 00:02:12,110
like I was so was so depressed,

35
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:17,170
so depressed and I got to the point where
I honestly felt like life wasn't worth

36
00:02:17,961 --> 00:02:19,190
living. And, um,

37
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:22,250
and now I'm like happy with who I
am and what my life has to offer.

38
00:02:22,251 --> 00:02:26,730
Even light on the roller coaster up and
downs of it. No, I can relate to the,

39
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:30,140
I feel like, I'm not going to say who
it is, but there was someone in my life,

40
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:35,360
I would always just come home like
shout at my mom and I am just like,

41
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:40,570
I felt like trapped almost and I couldn't
get out of the situation the second I

42
00:02:40,971 --> 00:02:45,200
laughed. That's like when my
happiness like chewy started hopping.

43
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,760
So your own crystal ball,
my own story.

44
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:55,760
Is there something that you dreamed of
doing for a long time and why haven't you

45
00:02:55,761 --> 00:02:56,340
done it?

46
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,190
I think traveling the world is somebody
I wanted to that I haven't had the

47
00:03:00,191 --> 00:03:03,910
opportunity til I travel
as much as I want to.

48
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,790
I just wish that there weren't
so many boundaries to that.

49
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:11,320
Like almost like if money and like other
things weren't in bed said like if we

50
00:03:11,321 --> 00:03:16,321
were all just like cave men and we were
just like all walking across the land is

51
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:21,220
doing it, the whole thing. Oh. So we
can all just travel across the world.

52
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,710
I want to try it well too.

53
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:26,660
I actually haven't been outside
of the U S and in point, um,

54
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,900
what I dreamed to do,
but I haven't done yet.

55
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:34,990
It's just like really goal
like 1000000000% with like
my art and just like put

56
00:03:37,191 --> 00:03:42,020
it out there and just be
really unapologetic and like
super confident and all of

57
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:43,750
that.
I think what's,

58
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:48,620
what's stopping me is
my confidence honestly.

59
00:03:48,621 --> 00:03:52,160
Like it's like a, it's like a
journey. Like I remember, um,

60
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,940
being like a super like non-competing guy.

61
00:03:55,941 --> 00:03:59,810
I wouldn't share any of my like passions
or talents or anything with anyone.

62
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:03,170
And now I'm like at this place where
I'm like working on things and putting

63
00:04:03,171 --> 00:04:03,741
things out there.

64
00:04:03,741 --> 00:04:07,580
Just exposing bits and pieces of stuff
myself so I can kind of make it happen.

65
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:09,650
Yeah.
So it's going to happen,

66
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,980
but like right now I'm like in transit,

67
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:16,700
I'm in transit.
It hasn't happened yet,

68
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:22,400
but once my confidence is on point
that I think it'll, it'll be there.

69
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:26,350
If you were going to become close
friends with your partner, please share.

70
00:04:26,351 --> 00:04:30,670
What would be important for
him or her to know? Dang,

71
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:32,620
how would I explain this?
Like at the end of the day,

72
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:37,270
the most important relationship that
they have is the one they have with

73
00:04:37,271 --> 00:04:41,260
themselves. And I'm here to supplement
that. Especially in our generation.

74
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,810
Like everything is so
instant. Everything is so, um,

75
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:48,700
expectation loaded.
Like you'd do something and you're like,

76
00:04:48,701 --> 00:04:52,270
expect something kind of fun.
Like I would really,

77
00:04:52,271 --> 00:04:55,840
really want them to know that I'm like,
not that,

78
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:58,770
that's awesome.
How about Chou?

79
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:04,480
I think what I would want my
partner to know and like what my,

80
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:08,950
all my friends know about me is
that like I'm transgender and like,

81
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:12,550
that's just like something
about me that like I'm proud of.

82
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:16,300
Obviously I would tell my partner
that as like my, all my friends know,

83
00:05:16,301 --> 00:05:18,070
obviously it's like a part of who I am.

84
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:23,140
Like that's not the first thing I say to
someone. Right. But like, yeah, like, hi,

85
00:05:23,141 --> 00:05:25,190
my name's Tyler and track.
Um,

86
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:29,950
but like I've been on such a journey
to get to where I am in terms of my

87
00:05:29,951 --> 00:05:33,220
mentality and my mental state, like
who I am. It's an important cause.

88
00:05:33,221 --> 00:05:34,670
The shapes like all of your experience,

89
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,720
the wall that ones say all of you
experienced with him in a lot of different

90
00:05:37,721 --> 00:05:38,554
ways.

91
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:47,530
Other eyes? Three or four
minutes. I want to take some way.

92
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,713
Okay,
we're ready.

93
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,593
Oh

94
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:09,870
I wouldn't describe Schuyler
as I would say silly.

95
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,680
She's a little shy and
nervous but very authentic.

96
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:19,540
He's like pure at heart.
He really does want the best for people.

97
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:30,720
I can tell she was like garden and she
like kind of like let me in a little bit

98
00:06:30,721 --> 00:06:35,280
which was just enough seeing like how
that Kinda took her to a different place

99
00:06:35,281 --> 00:06:38,910
to me to a different place and
it was like a roller coaster.

100
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,593
Yeah.

101
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:50,280
Like when you're like trying not to laugh
in class cause your friend's last name

102
00:06:50,281 --> 00:06:51,114
like you said.

103
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,550
Would you be interested in such a date?

104
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:58,020
I would be to like go as friends.
I don't know if that counts.

105
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:02,230
Like I don't see myself like with him
but like I would recommend him to my

106
00:07:02,231 --> 00:07:05,710
friends is such a good guy.
I want to like hang out with him one more.

107
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:10,820
This question is really allow you to
be vulnerable and learn so much about

108
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:13,630
linkedin person's life and
what their ambitions are.

109
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:21,010
Our last great.
Absolutely.

110
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:24,730
I enjoyed my first date with
her. It was, it was really cool.

111
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:32,230
Hi Guys, I'm Rachel and I'm Dan
