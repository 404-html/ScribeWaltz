1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,420
What was your worst case scenario that
you enter and then quickly leave? Oh,

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,460
that wouldn't have happened.
Well, now I know that,

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:08,293
yeah,

4
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:15,050
a viral New York Times article featured
36 questions that could supposedly make

5
00:00:15,051 --> 00:00:16,550
any two people fall in love.

6
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:20,720
We want it to see what would happen if
we ask these questions to two complete

7
00:00:20,721 --> 00:00:22,310
strangers on a blind date.

8
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,980
My name is Victoria.
I'm from Pennsylvania and I'm very single.

9
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:31,240
My last relationship was like three years
ago. I've been single for a long time.

10
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:36,010
My name is Claudio Peroni Jr. I'm from
Glendale, California, and I am shingle.

11
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:40,030
The worst end to this would probably be

12
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:44,560
her coming in and quickly leaving.

13
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,010
Yes. No, maybe during,

14
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:55,593
probably during.

15
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:04,570
Hello? Welcome to my
den Victoria. Claudio,

16
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,890
I say, Oh yes. Nice to meet you.

17
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:13,140
[inaudible] t four two.
I'm really nervous. Yeah.

18
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:16,700
Yeah. I never had a blind date before.
It's true. This is the first time. Yeah,

19
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:20,250
we're done. Good. What'd you like to open?
Yeah, I'll read the first question. Okay.

20
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:26,280
What is a physical attribute you secretly
or not so secretly like the most about

21
00:01:26,281 --> 00:01:28,950
yourself? It's your hair, isn't it?

22
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:36,720
No, I think my eyes, what color is it?

23
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:40,260
Can Be Gray right now. The term grades
sometimes. Is it like a mood ring? Yes.

24
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,610
There's different shades of gray.

25
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:44,700
I think you're kind of like a Blueish
blueish right now. Yeah. Was Great.

26
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,990
You're in love. Is that
what it means? Um, for me,

27
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,980
I like my tattoos, but is that, does that
count? Yeah. They're not like it's on you.

28
00:01:52,981 --> 00:01:57,320
If it's part of the now. Yeah. I tattooed
this one myself. Hand shut them. No, I did

29
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,610
me really hard. No, I liked this one
a lot because it's pretty recent.

30
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:05,010
What does that exists?

31
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:10,200
Which means Jesus Christ, son of
God, Savior. Okay. That's probably,

32
00:02:10,201 --> 00:02:13,680
I guess one of my most meaningful ones.
Yeah, that would've been a really,

33
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,230
but I can see that you're like
shy about it. I know people,

34
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,270
people are kind of judge you
sometimes about that. Oh yeah.

35
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,830
But I think the fact
he put it on your body,

36
00:02:19,831 --> 00:02:23,070
it's like it's in the right in the
middle, right? Don't read Greek. Yeah.

37
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:28,410
What'd you like to be famous and in what
way? Yes. In what way? For my personality.

38
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,650
Your personality and also for rap.
Awesome. You think about that?

39
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,870
Don't be shy about that. I'm not shy
about it. Okay, good. She has like,

40
00:02:34,871 --> 00:02:37,440
some people are like, no,
I'm a musician as well.

41
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,520
So do I play guitar on the songs to sing?

42
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,710
Got some stuff on Spotify. Oh yeah. Yeah.

43
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,450
I don't even have my own
music downloaded is open.

44
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,140
I'm going to close my eyes because
I don't want to see reaction.

45
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,003
Boy,

46
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:18,660
that's awesome. You are really good boys.
Thank you. So you can sing. Thank you.

47
00:03:18,661 --> 00:03:20,640
Yeah,
you should be recognized for that.

48
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:24,780
Take one minute and tell your partner
your life story in as much detail as

49
00:03:24,781 --> 00:03:27,300
possible. Do we have like a
timeline but stuff like watches.

50
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:30,750
So tell me when the
clock starts. Okay. Uh,

51
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:33,950
my father is Italian immigrant.
Uh,

52
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,540
I played baseball my entire life
till I was like 16, 17 years old.

53
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,460
Then I discovered that I
had a love for theater,

54
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:42,900
so I chose to do theater instead. I went
to college for theater, left college,

55
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,570
worked a bunch of bullshit jobs,
rediscovered my love for music,

56
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,990
started the music more seriously,
and now I'm here.

57
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:53,450
I guess it's not as hard
as it sounds. Okay. Yeah.

58
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,120
It's really hard for me because
like I have a bad memory.

59
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:00,110
So I was raised on a farm, uh,
like Ron, a lot Amish people,

60
00:04:00,111 --> 00:04:01,940
and I was really bad at school,

61
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:04,310
so I went through a bunch
of different school systems,

62
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:06,590
but in the end I was like cyber schooled.

63
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:11,650
I moved out as 18 and I was a nanny for
like three weeks and I got fired and

64
00:04:11,991 --> 00:04:13,700
then I moved to Indiana
and started a band.

65
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,710
We toured around the whole country for
a few years that like broke up and then

66
00:04:16,711 --> 00:04:17,420
he went to Ireland.

67
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:22,000
Then I moved to here and
then I did youtube and now
doing youtube as my career.

68
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:26,170
Wow. That's awesome. Yeah. What
kind of stuff was there, Ben?

69
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:32,390
What's not? Talk about that. I'm
going to look them up. Okay. Well,

70
00:04:32,391 --> 00:04:33,230
I'm not going to tell it to you.

71
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:38,900
If you knew that in one year you
would die suddenly. Jesus Christ.

72
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:43,420
This is very dark. Would you
change anything about the
way you are living? Right.

73
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:48,150
That's, it's so like you don't know
until you're there until you get,

74
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:50,010
if I knew for certain I
was going to die in a year,

75
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,840
I'll get a bunch of credit
cards and I would just like,

76
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:56,580
I just do like everything fun.
I feel like I'd like sell everything,

77
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:59,790
take my dog and like live in a mountain.
They just live in a mountain.

78
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:02,130
You're living in a mountain by
yourself. Yeah, with my dog.

79
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:04,390
You just like be alone for an entire year.
Yeah,

80
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:08,220
and the die will you spend a
year getting close to people.

81
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,500
Then you die and then new people. Then
all of a sudden you die and they're like,

82
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:10,771
oh,

83
00:05:10,771 --> 00:05:14,310
that guy was cool and then they wrote
songs and memories of you and stuff like

84
00:05:14,311 --> 00:05:14,600
that.
Yeah.

85
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,800
I would imagine as long as they can write
about how their friend got lost in the

86
00:05:16,801 --> 00:05:18,210
mountains and they never saw him again.

87
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:23,130
I think it'd be cooler if they
need better. I've got you can,

88
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,480
you can have that answer. No, you're
fine. That's the wrong answer.

89
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:34,370
What is true love? What is
true love? I know what it is.

90
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:38,600
We know what it is cause I just think
that it's accepting someone no matter what

91
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:43,460
you choose to love them. That's like the
choice. It's a choice that you've made.

92
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:46,850
So this is something I struggle with
because I had to deal with people we're

93
00:05:46,851 --> 00:05:50,870
talking about like soul mates. I saw
thing. I get, that's beautiful. All right,

94
00:05:50,871 --> 00:05:52,730
that's, that's beautiful.
That idea is beautiful, right?

95
00:05:52,731 --> 00:05:56,930
Like you stumble across someone who the
universe decided you have to be with.

96
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,360
Why isn't it more beautiful?
No, it's for shoes.

97
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,540
His shoes and like who
you spend your life with.

98
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:05,290
So like that's like the beauty in it.
It's like the work. The ground. Yeah.

99
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:10,100
Do you have a secret hunch about how
you will die? I don't want to die.

100
00:06:10,101 --> 00:06:11,560
Like I almost slipped in
the bathtub and dying.

101
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:15,640
It's not cold like the lane
I choke on something. Right?

102
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:21,680
Not to go to, but for a while I
thought it was gonna be suicide.

103
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:25,850
Why? Why did I think it
should be suicide? Yeah.

104
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:30,930
Just deeply depressed for a very
long time. How did you, like,

105
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:35,630
how do you, how do you do with
that? I don't like medication,

106
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,120
meaning like when I can't create,

107
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:41,600
like when I'm not able to do
things it gets really bad.

108
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:46,940
So I was auditioning and stuff after I
left college and then it wasn't really

109
00:06:46,941 --> 00:06:51,260
getting anything. So I just felt
like scum, like I walked away,

110
00:06:51,261 --> 00:06:54,680
I had a full ride and I walked
away from that to like go do it.

111
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,710
And then I wasn't doing it just felt
like shit I have to work out everyday

112
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,970
because I get like anxiety.
Yup. Like I have to work out.

113
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,010
That's what's helped me the most
too. Yeah. Share personal problem.

114
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:08,250
Ask Your partners advice on
how he or she might handle it.

115
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:12,990
I already know by problem that cause
I don't know what the fuck to say.

116
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:16,030
Ask me what's bothering you?
What's the problem? Well, I like,

117
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:20,530
I've kind of talked about it in passing
here, but I'm really bad with um,

118
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:23,530
relationships and I think
I go for the wrong people.

119
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,270
Like I haven't had a
relationship for like a while,

120
00:07:25,271 --> 00:07:28,150
like know like three years
and I've only had one.

121
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,710
I don't know if it's a Los Angeles thing,

122
00:07:29,711 --> 00:07:32,080
but no one really wants to
be in a relationship with me.

123
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:36,300
Why do you think that is?
Isn't this it's personal? Well,

124
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:40,300
first you have to know that that's not
a new thing. I don't know. It's not.

125
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,250
It never is.
That's what they all say yet.

126
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:45,580
What is the expectation
in anything bringing life,

127
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,950
it will lead to disappointment
at some point or another.

128
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:50,620
So if you just go into things
with an open mind going,

129
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:52,000
I don't know what the
fuck's going to happen,

130
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:56,060
but either way I'll make it work and
be fine. When you think about it,

131
00:07:56,260 --> 00:08:00,880
it kind of bugs you a little bit. I
don't think it like consciously like, no,

132
00:08:00,881 --> 00:08:03,790
it's kind of just like a little game that
I can't figure out how to play. Right.

133
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:07,300
That's the classic line written lovers.
Again, we're like dating's a game. Loves,

134
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:11,290
loves the choice. They circled
back and all of this full circle.

135
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:13,660
This is the last one to read together.

136
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,890
We're both going to have to answer it.
That's both were at the same time.

137
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:21,760
I know what it's going to say.
The risk of being wrong.

138
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:29,080
What'd you go on a second date with? It
was getting worse. Case scenario thing.

139
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:30,550
Yeah.
Oh,

140
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:35,320
what was your worst case scenario
that you enter and then quickly, oh,

141
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:38,080
that wouldn't have happened. Well,
no, I know that I would say, yeah,
