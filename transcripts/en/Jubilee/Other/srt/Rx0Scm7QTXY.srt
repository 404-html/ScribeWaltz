1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,640
At the time.
I was excited to get the call,

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:06,910
but everything in my body said say no.
Oh, really excited about it for sure.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,580
So totally different reactions shall we?
One,

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:13,620
two, three. Great.

5
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:23,613
Okay.

6
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:34,320
Started using the mask as a symbol of
just like craziness of being free of uh,

7
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:39,440
becoming something else. I started
creating these large black light painting.

8
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:44,280
Somehow the neon cutters allow me to
express myself like in a metaphysical way.

9
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,500
It got well received. Then it started
kind of calling me black light.

10
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:51,150
Okay.

11
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:54,760
Huh. How are you feeling? Um,

12
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:56,810
honestly I'm a little nerve wracked.

13
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:01,420
This is just completely outside my comfort
zone, which is the reason I said yes.

14
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:04,330
But how would you describe
yourself as a painter?

15
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:08,260
I think I would call myself like
a contemporary wildlife painter.

16
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,980
I kind of take the animal out of its
environment and put it on a background

17
00:01:11,981 --> 00:01:14,050
that's a little more abstract.
When I was younger,

18
00:01:14,051 --> 00:01:17,920
that's all I used to do is I used
to draw animals and I was completely

19
00:01:17,921 --> 00:01:22,780
fascinated by animals and I still
have like a deep love of, you know,

20
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:27,310
everything on four feet. If I were
to ask you what your expecting today?

21
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,210
Um,
I know we're going to paint something.

22
00:01:31,211 --> 00:01:35,710
I know I'm going to meet another artist
and I have no idea who that person is or

23
00:01:35,711 --> 00:01:38,590
what they do. I mean, they could
be a tattoo artist for all I know.

24
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:46,293
All right.

25
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,990
Hi.
How are you pushing her name?

26
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:58,520
Black light. Black light. Okay.
Wow. Nice to meet you too.

27
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,950
Now I'm very curious about what you do.

28
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:06,350
Oh yeah.
This is my cool city.

29
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,830
What I do is like I'll do regular colors
and then afterwards I'll add a neon

30
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:15,130
colors on top of it. It works with the
glasses too. There's glasses. Yeah.

31
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,673
Oh my gosh.
Okay.

32
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:23,190
No Way.
Oh my God.

33
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,990
What about you? What kind
of artwork do you do? Um,

34
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:32,610
I am a contemporary wildlife painters.
Paint animals. Okay. That's cool.

35
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:33,444
It's still sick.

36
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:36,780
That's cool though because if you paint
animals that we could do something dope.

37
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,410
Yeah. Um, yeah. Okay.
Cause I have some ideas.

38
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:43,620
I'm thinking you could paint the animal
and I could paint the spirit of the

39
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:47,540
animal. I love that idea, but like
super psychedelic with it. Yeah.

40
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:52,560
And you could go like kind of like
blend and the animal. The animal. Yeah.

41
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,130
Okay.
What if we did

42
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:04,720
something like, like kind of ground
the piece by this guy over here?

43
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:09,500
Yeah. Okay. Like for example, like this
will be your bird right here. Right. Okay,

44
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:14,120
cool. Then I'm nervous about
creating more sips. Good.

45
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,860
Without my normal process,

46
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:21,710
there is a possibility that I will
totally eat Kale, but I'm here.

47
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,570
Hey, black light. Do you want
to look at something like that?

48
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:33,410
So it's eight by 11 I didn't really know
what to expect. I'll tell you the truth.

49
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:34,790
I was thinking,
okay,

50
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:38,960
is it going to work or their style is
going to measure and of course personality

51
00:03:38,961 --> 00:03:43,150
wise, you know. However, I
was really optimistic. I mean,

52
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,450
it was good. All right, you like that?

53
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,340
All right,
so,

54
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:02,863
okay,

55
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:13,440
let's see. I need to like,
I need, it's good start.

56
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:17,260
I had a dream last night about raven.

57
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:20,170
I wanted to paint some recently,
you know,

58
00:04:20,171 --> 00:04:23,980
he had some birds and some of the work
that he showed me and I just thought,

59
00:04:23,981 --> 00:04:28,540
well, what if we worked on kind
of a raven portrait together?

60
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:34,750
I think part of how we wanted to
collaborate is to both retain our styles,

61
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:39,780
but somehow find a way to
have it integrate so that
it looked like a piece that

62
00:04:40,391 --> 00:04:42,910
was collaborated but not super separate.

63
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,710
Once we got these ideas going, it was
just, um, play with just like water.

64
00:04:52,711 --> 00:04:57,450
It was just streamlined. So I really
liked that process of being able to,

65
00:04:57,451 --> 00:05:01,020
on the spot, create something and
her ideas were really open to mine.

66
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:06,960
I think he has a really good
vision and imagination, you know,

67
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:13,020
even though our work is totally different,
we have a similar sensibility.

68
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:18,150
I don't know, it's a little hard to put
into words. I think it's just more of a,

69
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,143
the vibe.

70
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,173
Okay.

71
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:24,760
I feel that we, uh, managed to, uh,

72
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:27,920
bridge two styles
together and make it work.

73
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:29,990
That's really rewarding in itself.

74
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:33,003
Yeah.

75
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:46,160
Keep on coming so long here.
Left.

76
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,450
You have black lake
king when you're right.

77
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:53,050
You have some of Hoover supernatural.
Super.

78
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:57,423
Okay.

79
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:06,380
Hi everybody. Hello? Hello. Yeah.
Well, I don't know about you,

80
00:06:06,381 --> 00:06:09,020
but when I got the call,
actually the call,

81
00:06:09,021 --> 00:06:13,190
the email and the Instagram
message from Mra at the time,

82
00:06:13,191 --> 00:06:15,080
I was excited to get the call,

83
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:19,260
but everything in my body
said say no cause it,

84
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,400
it made me so nervous. You so you
were, you were looking forward to it.

85
00:06:22,401 --> 00:06:23,234
You weren't nervous the night before.

86
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:28,020
I was more nervous about the project
itself, you know, like, yeah, like, uh,

87
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:32,390
the hardworking, but anyhow, I,
it was great working with you.

88
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:35,270
I had a lot of fun and I learned a lot.

89
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:39,350
So shall we go? Ready? Ready.

90
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:42,243
Hey.

91
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:51,180
So we both kind of tried to
focus on our strengths, you know,

92
00:06:51,181 --> 00:06:55,410
so I did a more realistic version and he
did this amazing psychedelic spiritual

93
00:06:55,411 --> 00:06:58,230
version. Yeah. We like the, uh,
the raven because he has like,

94
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:00,710
it's like metaphysical,
uh,

95
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,660
we thought about rebirth a lot and um,

96
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,490
it like dying and being reborn into
a spirit animal and then, you know,

97
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,520
and then we have fun in
their worlds. Yeah, yeah,

98
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:12,523
yeah,

99
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:29,003
yeah.

100
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:55,610
