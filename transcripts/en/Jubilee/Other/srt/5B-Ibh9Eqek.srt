00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,070
Hey guys, let's meet Jason
here with the Jubilee Project.

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:04,950
Hope you guys are all doing well.

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:08,520
This is not the video actually for
the five K as we haven't run it yet.

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,420
We're going to be running on
Saturday, which is luck. Uh,

5
00:00:12,421 --> 00:00:15,000
but the reason for this video is
actually to put a date on your calendar.

6
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,790
And that day is April 8th,

7
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:22,290
2010 April 8th is a day without
shoes sponsored by toms shoes.

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,520
And the idea is that they want to get
people around the world to spend a day

9
00:00:26,521 --> 00:00:29,310
without shoes.
Like this can be your entire day,

10
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,890
this can be a portion of
your day, um, whatever.

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,220
But the reason is to grow awareness
for the millions of children throughout

12
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:38,730
developing countries who
grow up without shoes.

13
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:42,720
And apparently this causes a lot of
serious problems for them growing up.

14
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:46,290
So I thought that I
would be participating.

15
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,650
I would love for you to join me and
the millions or I'm not sure at the

16
00:00:49,651 --> 00:00:53,520
thousands of people around the world
who are participating as well. Uh,

17
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,380
there's more information at this link
at this video, but please, please,

18
00:00:58,381 --> 00:01:02,490
please, uh, send me a comment. Send me
a message if you'd like to participate,

19
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,410
and we'll make a nice
little video as well.

20
00:01:04,411 --> 00:01:08,910
And we'll post it up for the jubilee
project. But think about it. The Thursday,

21
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:13,320
April 8th, I'm going to be spending
my day without shoes at New York.

22
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:16,080
Uh, I'm not sure if I can
do that yet in the office,

23
00:01:16,081 --> 00:01:18,780
but I'm gonna figure that out.
But the rest of the day, if not,

24
00:01:18,781 --> 00:01:22,440
at least in the office, will be spent
without shoes and a, if you do it too,

25
00:01:22,441 --> 00:01:24,480
maybe you can make a nice
little compilation video,

26
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,210
but please let me know if you're
interested. It should be a great time.

27
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:28,230
Take care guys.
