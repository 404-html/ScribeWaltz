1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:03,010
The head of this corporation walks in

2
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:09,910
and he looks at me and says, hello
doctor shopper, where's your team?

3
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:13,830
And I said,
so I work alone in country.

4
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:18,160
I'm the only person who reaches
out to kids. And he sat down.

5
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,380
He did not say anything for the whole
minute. He looked at me and said,

6
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:27,490
she'll buy 500,000 children
under five are going blind.

7
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:33,720
You just one goal. You just one
person. How many places will you visit?

8
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:38,340
You're never going to get this done.
He stood up and walked away.

9
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,530
I was actually think he was
coming back. Um, he didn't.

10
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:50,570
If he went back and met with that guy
again, what would you tell him? Thank you.

11
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:00,380
I caught,
I was afraid of snakes.

12
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:05,390
The side of the beacon completely
remove their skin really freaked me out.

13
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:12,590
BEMIS origin is the top most that you
could achieve. Once you're in medicine,

14
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,670
you literally mean a lot of money.
I mean,

15
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,870
that's the word that most people be use.

16
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:22,190
So when I decided to leave surgery
and get into public health,

17
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:26,630
a lot of my peers ridiculed me and me.

18
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:31,690
Temporary insanity. I remember
one of my friends, yeah,

19
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:36,340
there for a reason. They're there
to tell you that it's not possible,

20
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,800
but it's not possible for them.

21
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,670
I lost all of my friends during that time.

22
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:45,863
One of my things,

23
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,200
why am I afraid of snakes?

24
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:00,240
The snake is able to let go of its
skin and start afresh every year.

25
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:02,820
Maybe I should also try and do that.

26
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,200
There is a difference between clinical
medicine and preventative medicine.

27
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,970
In clinical medicine,

28
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,070
a patient goes to a doctor when there
is something wrong in preventative

29
00:02:17,071 --> 00:02:17,904
medicine,

30
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,470
I will go to a patient even before
they know that something is wrong.

31
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:32,530
So a very early on, I remember
visiting a brick field in Kolkata.

32
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:37,750
There were these five kids
among 20 I would already blind.

33
00:02:37,751 --> 00:02:40,200
They had the white spots on the cornea

34
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:47,510
and that shocked me to the core. I had
never even heard of such a thing before.

35
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:51,320
There was no documentation of so many
children being blind in the same place.

36
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,000
When a child goes blind because
of vitamin E deficiency,

37
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:00,660
the transparent part of the eye, which
is called the cornea, literally males,

38
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:04,780
because there's not enough vitamin E
to hold the corneal structure together.

39
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:10,030
And I remember this one kid who was
three years old and I kept looking at the

40
00:03:10,031 --> 00:03:12,400
face trying to catch
a glimpse of her eyes,

41
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:17,610
but she kept shying away because I
think she was being bullied by the other

42
00:03:17,711 --> 00:03:18,544
kids.

43
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,630
I just wanted to check with
you about the shipping up. Now

44
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:29,580
I'm going to a birthday shit, but
rather the unofficial, uh, uh,

45
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:32,470
employee of whatever she does,

46
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:37,140
I always run around and know
she's in Parabola to help her out.

47
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:43,780
She gone, uh, see anyone in bean.
That's why she's able to do a job.

48
00:03:43,781 --> 00:03:47,680
So you want it to be a
doctor since forever.

49
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:49,420
Okay.

50
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:54,130
How far do was blame? So we understand
what blindness is all about. For us,

51
00:03:54,131 --> 00:03:55,210
it's a pretty emotional thing.

52
00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:00,910
So for a child who hasn't even seen
the world and unable to do it, it,

53
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,073
it depends a lot.

54
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:10,210
So all of these four graphs
have been shot by my dad.

55
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,750
He used to be a photographer and
this is what he did every weekend.

56
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:18,430
Bring other camera and make me photos.
As you can see,

57
00:04:18,431 --> 00:04:20,110
I'm very comfortable
in front of the camera.

58
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,750
I think it was trying to go for the jail.
Look,

59
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:28,480
I always have the sense of I
couldn't prevent his blindness,

60
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,520
but to my current work,

61
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:35,350
I have an opportunity to prevent
blindness in someone else.

62
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:36,783
However,

63
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:40,600
it's just the fact that these children
are located in such hard to reach areas.

64
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:44,470
It could be an urban slump.

65
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:52,900
They could be migrants who have just
come into a city and not daunted by the

66
00:04:52,901 --> 00:04:54,010
local health authorities.

67
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:59,290
We knew that there was a problem
and we knew what the solution was.

68
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,870
Oh,
it's a simple intervention.

69
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:06,820
Two capsules a year of high dose vitamin
A can prevent blindness in children

70
00:05:06,821 --> 00:05:10,870
under five. So we had two dots, but
we didn't know how to connect them.

71
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:15,780
Essentially, if I knew that the
challenge is in, in dry food,

72
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:20,050
I go to write book, uh, reached
500 kids over day with vitamin E

73
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,280
and then I come back.

74
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:29,950
Then I knew of another place in
Orissa and the tribal belts over Resa.

75
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:38,090
We'd each out over them support thousand
kids under five and then again come

76
00:05:38,091 --> 00:05:38,924
back.

77
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:46,150
Every time I went out to a new area, I
will speak to them about the intervention.

78
00:05:46,151 --> 00:05:49,390
They would think about it and
then they would get back saying

79
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,620
it was just me going to a new area and
coming back maybe and shorting one doors,

80
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,030
but that wouldn't really help.

81
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:04,540
We needed someone to keep doing this
program again and again and again do the

82
00:06:05,121 --> 00:06:08,360
child was five years of age.
I was talking to the auto guy,

83
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:11,660
I was talking to taxi drivers,
people on the plane,

84
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:16,610
people in the washroom and most of them
would take the card, look at it and say,

85
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,230
interesting,
we get back to you

86
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,383
and it's tough.

87
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:31,420
It's tough because even right now I know
that kids in some of the states where

88
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,590
you're not getting the Dominik.

89
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:34,080
Okay,

90
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,480
and you can do only so much.

91
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,053
Okay.

92
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:51,340
I was visiting a deaf and mute partner.

93
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:57,080
There were these five zero to put into
your or speak and they were being taught

94
00:06:57,081 --> 00:07:02,081
how to make the tongues and the to make
a sound and there was this young girl,

95
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:09,050
the teacher would repeat a different sound
every time and she would just keep on

96
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:13,640
saying, the Dj would say
far and she would say, God,

97
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:15,680
the Dj would say bar and she would say,

98
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:20,450
just repeat the same sound
again and again and again,

99
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:25,470
but she was doing it with so much
enthusiasm and so much domination.

100
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:28,320
I couldn't stop myself
from crying for 15 minutes.

101
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:37,020
Shaper, how dare you feel
disheartened by one failure?

102
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:39,600
How dare you look at this girl,

103
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:42,710
she's five she can't speak.

104
00:07:42,711 --> 00:07:47,711
She cannot sure and yet look at the
enthusiasm in which he's trying to know.

105
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:54,110
This was not something I was
going to be able to do a loan.

106
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:59,490
I think not many people
know about the angry shaper,

107
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:03,430
how angry she can get funds
a valuation writing. She,

108
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:04,480
I don't know what the incident was,

109
00:08:04,481 --> 00:08:07,160
but she got angry and she
just smashed a window pane.

110
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:12,050
Just mash it with the bare hands.
[inaudible].

111
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:15,540
She wanted to learn martial arts.
My father never allowed it.

112
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:19,410
He was always updates.
You would get some of that.

113
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:20,603
Okay.

114
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:27,620
One of my friends had a friend who
knew off a mother's group in northern.

115
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,720
I had not even heard of
Nagaland at that point of time.

116
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:34,720
Yeah.

117
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:39,010
[inaudible] is the most eastern
steeped in the country of India.

118
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,450
It borders with Myanmar.

119
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:41,803
Yeah.

120
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:44,680
There's no more durable wrote
with some of the villages.

121
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,970
They literally had to walk up to a
few villages for three days. Even.

122
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:53,250
You were initially very apprehensive,

123
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:58,350
but we train them within month and we
have been preaching about 60 to 70,000

124
00:08:58,351 --> 00:09:00,630
children under five now.
For the past seven years,

125
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:05,850
these weren't our doctors or even
medical workers. It was a mother's group.

126
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:10,470
All women in the most
remote part of the country.

127
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:15,660
That was a surprise. And then from then
on, things when you started speeding up,

128
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:21,150
identifying local volunteers who would
take the responsibility of saying,

129
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:24,510
yes,
we will sustain the program going forward.

130
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:29,220
If you give us the proper tools in
terms of training, in terms of medicine,

131
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:30,263
we will take it.

132
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:35,280
And so more people joining this
mission is actually what was important.

133
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:39,090
Without whom we would not have been able
to reach the number of children we are

134
00:09:39,091 --> 00:09:44,091
reaching right now and give reaching
12.5 million children in India right now.

135
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:08,560
I think all of us have our stories.

136
00:10:08,561 --> 00:10:11,560
We just need to own up to our story.

137
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:18,850
Why did I have to go through this pain
of seeing my most beloved person go

138
00:10:19,401 --> 00:10:20,480
through blindness?

139
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:30,290
I think that thing was meant, said,
I could understand my colleagues.

140
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:36,320
You do get an understanding
of why it's happening,

141
00:10:36,321 --> 00:10:39,590
why it's you now I do
understand why it's me.

142
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,273
That's my story.

143
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,210
Thank you for watching.
Uh,

144
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:56,810
this piece about Dr Shilpa in India
and we made this for giving me.

145
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,713
That's right.

146
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:00,750
Not only to highlight Dr Chopra and
the amazing work that she's doing,

147
00:11:00,751 --> 00:11:03,960
but also to raise awareness for another
organization called Doctors Without

148
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,240
Borders.
They go where no other groups go.

149
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:10,500
They'll respond to natural disasters,
a war victims,

150
00:11:10,501 --> 00:11:13,560
even disease doctors,
nurses, logistical experts.

151
00:11:13,561 --> 00:11:16,860
Over 30,000 of them in 60 different
countries. I would just stop man.

152
00:11:16,861 --> 00:11:19,210
What an incredible opportunity.
We have a,

153
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:23,580
especially during this holiday season to
raise awareness and money for a really

154
00:11:23,581 --> 00:11:27,000
worthy cause and we want to just encourage
all of the jubilee leavers out there,

155
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:29,390
uh, to give. This will continue to,

156
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:33,750
to be an opportunity for you guys to give
well until the new year watching. Um,

157
00:11:33,751 --> 00:11:37,620
so whether it's $1 or $5,
definitely one encourage you guys to give.

158
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:41,120
The other cool thing is when you donate,
your donation will be matched.

159
00:11:41,121 --> 00:11:45,110
So when you get $5, that's doctors
without borders will get $10.

160
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:48,470
Thank you guys for hanging around and
thank you for letting us do what we do in

161
00:11:48,471 --> 00:11:51,980
highlighting great people in great stories
and we hopefully we can do a lot more

162
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:55,100
stick around. We have a lot more videos
for you guys that are good stuff.

163
00:11:55,101 --> 00:11:56,360
So we'll see you next time.
