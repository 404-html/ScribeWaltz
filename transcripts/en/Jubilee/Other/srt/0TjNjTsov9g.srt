1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,770
Everything I could avoid saying like, I
love you. I said it. Thank you. Yes. You,

2
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:06,600
you know what you know,
you know.

3
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:19,100
Oh, okay. Yeah,

4
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,170
I am Trey Baxter and I am 24 years old.

5
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:25,990
I'm clean a Cordova and I'm 21,

6
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:28,533
10 years.

7
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,840
Woo.
We're on top of things.

8
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:36,530
Wow. I can't hear anything. Yeah,

9
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:40,540
she's grooving.
Okay.

10
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:41,573
Yeah.

11
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,880
I don't know what story she'll tell you,
but uh,

12
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:49,260
we actually met on Tinder.
Funny enough. I know, I know.

13
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,230
And uh, sure enough, I get a message,

14
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,220
I get a match and it's this just
gorgeous girl. I'm, when she said, Hey,

15
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,460
do you want to just like go get a pizza?
I know an awesome Italian restaurant.

16
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,700
And I was just like,
yeah,

17
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,010
I do want to get pizza and go to
an Italian restaurant with you.

18
00:01:05,011 --> 00:01:09,180
So that same night, um, just a couple
of hours later, I told my friends like,

19
00:01:09,181 --> 00:01:09,520
they were like,
yeah,

20
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,000
hey dude. Hey Dude, you want to hang
out? And I'm like, no, I have date.

21
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:15,760
Can't hear you. You're
good. You can take them off.

22
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:23,300
So my friend had come over that
evening and made me a Tinder account.

23
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:29,190
Um, I had one for one night and,
and I met him. It was like, well,

24
00:01:29,191 --> 00:01:33,330
he's very attractive. I'd like to talk
to him. And then I asked him to go meet,

25
00:01:33,331 --> 00:01:38,331
meet at this like Italian restaurant that
I pretended to know it closed like in

26
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:42,840
a half an hour.
And we didn't want the date to end.

27
00:01:42,841 --> 00:01:47,250
So we went to another place that
was open for another hour. Um,

28
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:50,580
and then that closed and we
still wanted to hang out.

29
00:01:50,581 --> 00:01:53,940
So we went to another place
that was open 24 hours.

30
00:01:53,941 --> 00:01:55,290
So we had all the time in the world.

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,580
First thing I noticed was her eyes,
like her eyes popped out.

32
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,850
She just was so gorgeous.
I couldn't help but stare at her.

33
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,650
My first impression was that he,
he had so much like enthusiasm.

34
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,930
I got there five minutes late. I don't
know why, but I was like, I'm so sorry.

35
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:14,430
Wait, hey. Oh my God, I'm so
sorry. I'm two minutes late. Like,

36
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:18,560
I don't like being late. I
really don't like that. But yeah,

37
00:02:18,561 --> 00:02:22,220
I just remember you were like bolting,
apologizing.

38
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,710
I'm so sorry I'm late. I
was like, it's okay, please.

39
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:33,130
When I realized she was different,
I wanted to date this person was,

40
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:38,110
she was going on a week long vacation.
I prepared myself.

41
00:02:38,111 --> 00:02:42,310
I was just like, okay, she's going
to be gone. So just let her go.

42
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,840
Don't message her.
Don't be annoying.

43
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:47,500
And so that whole entire time I
could not stop thinking about her.

44
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:52,600
Towards the end of her vacation,
she's messaged me. It's really weird.

45
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:55,960
I miss you after just hanging
out with her four days in a row,

46
00:02:55,961 --> 00:02:59,200
she's sent me that message. I was
just like, okay, that means something.

47
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:01,823
I think

48
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:07,160
the hardest, biggest one for me
was when we first started dating.

49
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:11,990
Um, cause she's very goal oriented and
uh, she's very much about her career.

50
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:16,220
She thought at first that being in a
relationship would be kind of hard and

51
00:03:16,221 --> 00:03:17,240
distract her from it.

52
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:22,130
And so she just kind of needed to take
time for herself to focus on herself and

53
00:03:22,131 --> 00:03:23,210
her life and what she wanted.

54
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:26,480
She wanted to keep talking to me in
this time that we were broken up,

55
00:03:26,481 --> 00:03:27,380
prevent mother too.

56
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:31,160
And she kept calling me and put me in a
very confused state and I started to get

57
00:03:31,161 --> 00:03:31,994
really upset.

58
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:32,870
Yeah.

59
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:37,870
I think the biggest one was a total
game changer for me because it made me

60
00:03:40,641 --> 00:03:43,040
realize how much I wanted to be with him.

61
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:47,840
But I remember how I felt during
this fight and he left. Um,

62
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:51,890
I stayed in the apartment and I was
going crazy because he shut his phone off

63
00:03:51,891 --> 00:03:55,790
and I couldn't talk to him and I had
no idea and I had stayed up that whole

64
00:03:55,791 --> 00:04:00,350
night.
I'm waiting for him to come home and uh,

65
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:05,390
and he did and he came home with coffee.
I didn't want to say anything.

66
00:04:05,391 --> 00:04:07,970
I just wanted to apologize.
Um,

67
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,950
and that was, that was, I
think the biggest fight.

68
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,880
Your ears are sweating

69
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:24,780
me. I said that. Let me first.

70
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:28,240
Okay. This is how I said, I said,
I literally said hypothetically,

71
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,360
if I said I love you,
how would you feel?

72
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,800
Ah,

73
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:37,100
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

74
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:37,860
yeah.

75
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,750
He is extremely romantic.

76
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:43,380
He's like one of those
hopelessly romantic kind of guys.

77
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:47,670
And I was and still am,

78
00:04:47,671 --> 00:04:49,230
the garlic doesn't like cheesy thing.

79
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,150
We relying on his car and you said,
I love you.

80
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:58,910
And I remember saying like, it's just
a blur of words kind of saying like,

81
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:02,250
thank you. Like everything I could avoid
saying like, I love you. I said it.

82
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,850
Thank you. Yes. You, you
know what you know, you know,

83
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,340
I was not ready or I wasn't sure.

84
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:12,720
I didn't know what the I
love you could bring up out.

85
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,400
So I just kept it at,
you know,

86
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:17,643
mmm.

87
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:22,070
I chose you because it just felt right.
It felt like a,

88
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:26,880
it felt like it was very much supposed
to happen. And uh, I have never felt,

89
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:30,750
um,
happiness like I do with you.

90
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,430
Okay.

91
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,830
I just,
I have never ever been happier.

92
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,400
I know it's because he,

93
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:48,180
I feel like it's just such a
rare person to come across.

94
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:52,870
Um, in general, just in your life.
I think out of, out of everyone,

95
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,730
uh,
I just like,

96
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:59,820
I love being with him
because it's trendy and,

97
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,890
um,
and I think that like,

98
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,290
he keeps me

99
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,500
like just loving life all the time.

100
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:16,870
I've grown up massively, uh,
after meeting her because of her,

101
00:06:16,871 --> 00:06:18,600
if she snapped me out of a lot of things.

102
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:23,630
And so I have a grown up
massively matured hell of a lot.

103
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:29,370
Um, and I would not be that mature
or growing up if I had not met her.

104
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,380
No. I told her everything and
literally tell her everything.

105
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,153
Yes.

106
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:49,400
Go ahead.
No,

107
00:06:49,401 --> 00:06:53,660
I don't think there's anything
that we haven't talked about.

108
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,620
Do you have anything? No. Nope.

109
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:01,543
That'd be safe.

110
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:04,940
Okay.

111
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:09,120
Thank you. Very nice. Thank you,
man. That was fun. Good. Whoa.
