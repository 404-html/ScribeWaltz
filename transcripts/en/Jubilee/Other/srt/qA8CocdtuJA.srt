1
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:05,640
I live in La.

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,680
Three people in your friends wound up
here and I always visit and then I would

3
00:00:12,901 --> 00:00:16,320
drive through the Hollywood hills and
see these homes and I was thinking,

4
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,700
I need to do this. You
know, I need to be here.

5
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:25,430
For some people they prefer to sit
behind a desk from eight to five.

6
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:27,920
I fall asleep.
It's all about energy.

7
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,170
I drive a lot, man. Um,

8
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:43,220
you guys sat in from like Pasadena
or way to thousand oaks to Hollywood,

9
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:46,330
Beverly Hills and you got good reviews.
It good polls,

10
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:47,790
but you see why they pay the price.

11
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:56,530
I'm from the island of Guam
smile in 26 miles long.

12
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:59,760
All my siblings are back home.
Just me out here.

13
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:06,010
I tell my clients that I'm 25

14
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:12,610
but I am early twenties.
The good thing is,

15
00:01:12,611 --> 00:01:15,430
is the clients that I work
with are all very young people.

16
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:19,600
Like they're all kind of doing the same
thing as me because I utilize social

17
00:01:19,601 --> 00:01:24,220
media. The people that I connect with
on, there are younger people who are,

18
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:29,050
you know, you tubers or music artists or
music producers. Every client, you know,

19
00:01:29,051 --> 00:01:32,110
they want a house in a different area.
So I'm all over the place. You know,

20
00:01:32,111 --> 00:01:36,340
I'm running from Venice, Santa Monica all
the way, you know, it's even silver lake,

21
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:42,570
12 pills a day. It'd be, takes you
half an hour to clean the pool.

22
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,460
It's definitely 20 bucks.

23
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:48,970
You can say it's about
managing time because if you
stay out of your morning for

24
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:51,750
12 hours a day, you're pretty much
making less than minimum wage.

25
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:56,190
I think the hours that
I put in for both jobs,

26
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,170
the most 16 the minimum 12
hours, I say like, Dude. Yeah,

27
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:04,920
and that's just to survive in California,
you know,

28
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:10,350
most of the deals I do are like 5 million
and under mostly because a lot of my

29
00:02:10,351 --> 00:02:11,610
clients are younger.

30
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:16,200
Do you see the big purchases
that are like 20 million plus?

31
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:19,290
Those ones are usually older people,
you know, it just makes sense.

32
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:22,560
You've been on the planet longer, you've
made more money, you can afford it.

33
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,760
I mean my office,

34
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:27,600
we have the $188 million
listing up in Bel Air.

35
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:30,450
They were really trying to get
Jay Z and Beyonce to buy the home.

36
00:02:30,451 --> 00:02:31,560
They thought it was perfect for them.

37
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:35,910
They have been trying to connect with
every single billionaire in the world.

38
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:38,130
That's quite a risk you're taking

39
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,600
kneepads cause as the day goes by when
you keep kneeling down on your knees

40
00:02:44,601 --> 00:02:46,490
about padding,
it tends to hurt.

41
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:53,973
Hey,
how's it going

42
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:00,523
dude?

43
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:05,540
So this is the asset tag.
This is the chlorine tank.

44
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:08,180
You mix chlorine and acid together.

45
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:11,510
You can chemically make mustard gas.

46
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:16,690
I once mix Corrine and acid in the wrong
tank on accident and you can endure

47
00:03:17,241 --> 00:03:20,720
like burn marks. But inside your
system from the smoke itself,

48
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:23,150
you learn your lessons
after each things happen.

49
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,610
Properties when they're forced sale
and you get commissioned and it's,

50
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,960
if you're representing the buyer,

51
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:33,760
the standard is typically 2.5%
of the purchase price. Honestly.

52
00:03:33,761 --> 00:03:38,350
How much do you think this house is?
It's like a town house or is it Venice?

53
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,030
One and a half,

54
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:45,030
3.3

55
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:46,880
wipe provides it for me,

56
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,820
gives me everything that I needed
to try to keep me safe out here.

57
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:51,020
Her name is April.

58
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:56,540
I worked at the UFC gym in 2015 for her
at the gym was like a getaway for her to

59
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:59,740
go relax. Why people
do that, you know, man,

60
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:01,760
I I if I didn't meet her,

61
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:05,030
I'll probably say I used to sleep
in the back of the gym, the UFC gym.

62
00:04:05,031 --> 00:04:09,200
Like hadn't, you know, I'll
wake up, train, train people,

63
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:13,270
um, teaching class and that's it.
You know, that's like a bachelors,

64
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:15,170
a lifestyle.

65
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:20,460
Like now as I try to help her pursue
her career first and also like try to

66
00:04:21,381 --> 00:04:25,940
secure financial for her and
my, my two cats, you know, like,

67
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:28,340
um,
it makes me happy.

68
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,820
Are you going to,
that's the goal,

69
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:37,780
you know, and you don't even have to live
in it and you can make money from it.

70
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:43,060
I had a client who I, I showed
him a, a house in studio city,

71
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:48,850
the La Galaxy soccer team did a photo
shoot at the house for one night and then

72
00:04:49,361 --> 00:04:50,950
paid them $30,000.

73
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:55,340
It's right now we're going to see
Catherine and she's leasing this home, um,

74
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:59,080
for about $14,000 a month in commission,

75
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:01,300
somewhere around 7,000.

76
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:06,750
You know Elise still you make a whole
lot less than a sale but so one time,

77
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:11,590
7,000, right, exactly. And then,
and then in this case scenario,

78
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:15,370
you know, I found her this lease
and now this lease is turned,

79
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,930
has turned into a sale.
You know,

80
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:18,910
cause I'm going to be finding
her property to buy now.

81
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,310
Hey you
I know.

82
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,220
Try trying to like three or four.
That's how much after,

83
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:40,150
I mean I was thinking
like the foothills stadio,

84
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:44,030
Cindy Sherman oaks. So you're on the
backside of the hill. That's fine.

85
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,480
It's way cheaper and that's fine.

86
00:05:45,481 --> 00:05:48,600
You can drive down to Ventura or he
can drive Laurel Canyon. It's La.

87
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:51,480
I have to drive through this
all the time. Yeah, we all do.

88
00:05:51,481 --> 00:05:55,680
So used to it by now and get them, make
sure you have a place for all those cars.

89
00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:00,390
We want to be to at least park two
to three cars in a garage and um,

90
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:04,370
at least be able to put
maybe like four cars outside,

91
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:09,150
which is why it's important to
like this one right here. Oh,

92
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,700
that looks nice. Not have a pool.
It does. And picky, but I'm not,

93
00:06:13,701 --> 00:06:18,400
I know what I like the dream client.
Well that's good. I'm glad I'm the tree

94
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,293
Kia

95
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:27,200
can to complain. They'll watch
you. They'll look out the window,

96
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,990
had a lady,

97
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:34,190
she pretty much watch you and to make
sure you do everything that's on that

98
00:06:34,191 --> 00:06:38,190
checklist. How did that
go when gray, you know,

99
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:43,300
it makes my job so much easier when my
clients are actually my friends and she

100
00:06:44,521 --> 00:06:47,280
said she'll spend up to 4 million.

101
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:50,820
What is 2.5% of 4 million?

102
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,210
I love tender Greens. It's so
good. And it's not even expensive.

103
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:09,720
I don't watch very many interviewers,
but I'd definitely uh,

104
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,440
I've always watched Danny.
It's videos.

105
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:14,470
We're going to go meet up with him
and this house has a nightclub in it.

106
00:07:14,471 --> 00:07:17,170
So it could be interesting.

107
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:21,250
Life out here is different now.
Like you go to island slow,

108
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,440
everyone's chilling here. Everyone's
moving my salary back there, it was like,

109
00:07:26,441 --> 00:07:28,870
what?
15,000 a year

110
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,720
on a bad email. One of my deals just
close. So that was coke get some coffee.

111
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:39,360
So this was actually like
small, you know, 2.5% of it.

112
00:07:39,361 --> 00:07:42,780
It's like roughly around $10,000.

113
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:47,490
It's definitely not bad for not
even stepping foot on this property.

114
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:50,400
Are you doing man? Yeah.
One more. And one more

115
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:55,880
coworker she's checking.

116
00:07:55,881 --> 00:07:58,640
You know that usually maybe like
eight how many more poles you got man,

117
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:02,150
this conversation, you know,
cause like it's not a lonely job,

118
00:08:02,151 --> 00:08:05,810
but it's just like either listening
to music or you talked to your other

119
00:08:05,811 --> 00:08:09,260
coworkers.
He know it's just a dream job.

120
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:12,830
But I like to work in animation,
but I don't know how to draw,

121
00:08:12,831 --> 00:08:16,900
so I'm not really going to
try to pursue that. You know,

122
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,800
you're like in your mind
you can configure it.

123
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:24,150
It's down to the very last screw or very
less sketch when when you actually take

124
00:08:25,221 --> 00:08:28,430
paper to pencil,
it doesn't come out man.

125
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:34,170
No, you guys are excited about this.
The good thing is it's only $23,

126
00:08:34,171 --> 00:08:37,080
but I don't know how I got,
I got a parking ticket.

127
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:41,610
Do you literally look at the sign
and it says turn wheels to curb?

128
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:45,120
I did not know.
That was even a thing.

129
00:08:45,121 --> 00:08:48,200
Dude in my hometown to Michaela,

130
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:50,910
my dad sells yachts

131
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:57,680
and he's built and design
boats because whole life, um,

132
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:01,710
which is how I kind of first got
into that and then I was like, man,

133
00:09:01,711 --> 00:09:06,360
this is pretty boring. Did you start out
working for your dad's company? Yeah,

134
00:09:06,361 --> 00:09:09,630
I started,
I started working under him,

135
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,740
like following them around and learning,
you know,

136
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,800
and then I just didn't feel right.
You know,

137
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:22,010
my family back home, you
know, they're simple people.

138
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:25,190
I have two sisters and one brother.
The two old days,

139
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:29,750
they're not as vicious as a t young is.
We all have our,

140
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,450
our reasons,
what we do and why we do.

141
00:09:32,451 --> 00:09:37,451
And one of the reason why I moved out
here is because I wanted a better life.

142
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,920
How much is this for
sale? Three. Three now.

143
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:53,900
Yeah. I'm just looking at this house
right now. 3 million up in the hills.

144
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:01,960
I want a little flavor, you know,
besides just plain wires does a bad day.

145
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,720
You're looking at approximately throat
and rotate your shoulder phone, phone.

146
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,550
Oh yeah, they got the movie theater and
here to here. You got some full on bar.

147
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:17,320
I don't even drink. What Papa of
move in. Move Out to jab, cross,

148
00:10:17,321 --> 00:10:18,310
move in and move out.

149
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,740
Do you want to go home and get it like
a foot massage man, after your own day?

150
00:10:35,741 --> 00:10:36,574
Like this

151
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:40,430
smile be even more busy.
It's all about energy. Male,

152
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,760
like having good energy in a
class. Pushing people, keep
them going. And it's fun.

153
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:55,380
It's crazy to think where am I
going to be in five, 10 years?

154
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:56,770
Ooh.

155
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:00,020
And it's just the most wild
thought to me cause I don't know.

156
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:05,690
No one yet from Guam has
ever fought in for a belt.

157
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:10,490
My goal is to just make it onto one of
the fighting organization doing glory.

158
00:11:10,491 --> 00:11:15,020
Man, I'd love to stand and bang all
around it. It was just a great day,

159
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,220
just grinding away,

160
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,660
15 hour shift today, you
know? But it was overall good.

161
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,690
Any job is great,

162
00:11:29,691 --> 00:11:33,260
but like are you going to wake up someone
next you that loves you for who you

163
00:11:33,261 --> 00:11:37,370
are? It's not about being
happy in the end, man.

164
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:46,770
Where's it at you? Hey, where's
the remote? Put It on some jubilee.
