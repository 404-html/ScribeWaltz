1
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:05,380
First violent to me if
I was interested for me.

2
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:08,150
And so when we have in stealing,

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,660
killing cops,
everything,

4
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:15,720
drugs taken jubilee project to
the next level for the stores,

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,050
we still believe that doing good
is contagious. It's still hard.

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,110
So have the portable son has always been,

7
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:44,800
I grew up listening to
the story at church,

8
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:49,770
but it never really hit me until
I started making this film.

9
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:54,170
How do the sun is such a profound story?

10
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,230
Something that I could really relate
with is probably one of the most intimate

11
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,470
passages of scripture in all the Bible.

12
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:07,110
And what you have is a son who
is pretty arrogant and he says,

13
00:01:07,441 --> 00:01:10,740
give me my inheritance or giving
me what I, what I deserve.

14
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:14,700
And so when he said that in a
minute needed Mideastern culture,

15
00:01:14,701 --> 00:01:17,310
he was basically saying,
I wish you were dead.

16
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:20,510
So just give me the money problem,
challenge

17
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:28,490
Shane and his father around and trying
to make his own way to still know his

18
00:01:29,461 --> 00:01:33,590
dad's money. And what's crazy is
the father gave him be heretics.

19
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,011
Knowing Kali,

20
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:39,150
that the sandwich squander all the Laos
and in the Senate of course goes off and

21
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:42,120
there's this crazy life,
this takes waste.

22
00:01:42,121 --> 00:01:46,770
All the money just really lives in the
world and ends up finding that it's a

23
00:01:46,771 --> 00:01:48,030
pretty cool place.

24
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:56,560
The turning point in the film is when
the sun reaches this utter sense of

25
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,040
hopelessness when he's got nothing left,

26
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:05,230
spent all the money and there's nothing
in this world that satisfies and it's

27
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:14,050
when he's in this deep sense of pain
that he starts to let go of this need for

28
00:02:14,091 --> 00:02:15,590
what the world tells him to have.

29
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:20,980
And so this is then part where he knows
that he has to make a change for the

30
00:02:22,371 --> 00:02:26,630
better or a better life, a different life,
and leave the one that he's been doing.

31
00:02:26,631 --> 00:02:27,464
Huh?

32
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:31,810
And he said it'd be better if he goes
back home and he goes back home broken.

33
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,060
So you see him totally open
and obedient to his father.

34
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:38,000
But what was cool was this,

35
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:42,670
the father saw his son from a fire and
I love the picture of this like Mid

36
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,950
Eastern Asian type of dad
running towards the Sun.

37
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,850
And then it says he embraces
him and he kisses him.

38
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,180
And this is the most powerful verse to me.

39
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:54,790
Like we're kissing is used over and over
again, or it's in the iterative sense.

40
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:58,900
So it's like he kissed him over
and over and over and over.

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,870
It's showing this blessing,
this grace

42
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:05,983
3.1.

43
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,890
This is one where I really was able to
connect to the character after the part

44
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:15,520
of the son's story is like, you know,
one of the most popular stories, average.

45
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:18,590
A lot of people can relate to it
and we've all been there. I've

46
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,790
been in the sun and the farm,

47
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:28,550
I can relate to the room and just having
neck stage of rebellion and he's not

48
00:03:29,111 --> 00:03:33,370
like realizing how much their parents
love them and always wanting something

49
00:03:33,371 --> 00:03:38,080
else. And then finding out
that that somebody else is
not good, not good. Anyways,

50
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,030
my parents divorced when I was

51
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:47,380
a teenager, when I was about 15 and it
was a result and under fair my dad had.

52
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:49,840
And I hate it. My Dad, in fact,

53
00:03:49,841 --> 00:03:52,750
I didn't want to talk to him
and I didn't for a long time.

54
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,680
And, uh, so I,

55
00:03:55,681 --> 00:04:00,550
I kind of spiraled out of control where
I just partied and I did my own thing.

56
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:05,440
So, you know, fast forward some,
I still had problems with my dad.

57
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:08,050
You know,
I'd give my life to God.

58
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:11,410
It's supposed to be like this now
Christian Guy that really loves God.

59
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:15,160
But I had this like hatred from my father.
I couldn't,

60
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:19,090
I this judgement against
him even though myself,

61
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:23,800
I'd done crazy stupid thing. I
couldn't see that. I just saw his sin.

62
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,690
And so that dominated me until one night
I was walking across the campus as a

63
00:04:28,691 --> 00:04:32,110
college student and I thought,
I heard a voice saying,

64
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:37,000
you need to love your
father. And I said, uh,

65
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,580
I don't think I can because
I have no feelings for him.

66
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,250
And I felt God say,

67
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:45,790
you think my son's felt
like going to the cross.

68
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:51,130
Then I got it. I said, love
is not about a feeling.

69
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:57,010
Love is about commitment. It's not
about me liking a person necessarily.

70
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:59,320
It's about me committing myself to one.

71
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:12,980
It took me about a year and a half to
make this film and I kind of wrote it, um,

72
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:15,250
when I was a very different
person than I am today.

73
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:21,040
I think the main difference between
then and now was that I started to

74
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:24,580
understand what it means to receive grace.

75
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:28,060
Throughout my whole life, I've
always, I've always lived on there,

76
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:31,510
this belief that the harder I
worked and why I'm able to achieve,

77
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,440
and then the more happy I'm able
to become. And so I worked hard.

78
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:37,540
I went to great college
at Harvard University.

79
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:40,600
I achieved my American dream
of working at the White House.

80
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:45,430
I was living a very comfortable life
and yet there was still something empty

81
00:05:45,431 --> 00:05:49,600
about this whole thing. No matter how
hard I tried to put up this front,

82
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,110
to put up this image that
everything was all that together.

83
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:58,800
Deep down inside I realized I still felt
like life was still very meanings to

84
00:05:59,181 --> 00:06:03,660
me.
And no matter how much harder I work,

85
00:06:03,661 --> 00:06:08,000
the harder I tried. There was still
this very strong void in my life.

86
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,280
I felt so depressed.

87
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:15,700
I felt so exhausted and I hit the rock
bottom of my life and there was one night

88
00:06:16,131 --> 00:06:19,430
where I just felt completely
all the simpler where I
thought about taking my own

89
00:06:19,431 --> 00:06:22,070
life.
During that season of depression,

90
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,030
I was diagnosed with a
disease called hepatitis B,

91
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:31,010
and when I first found out about it,
um,

92
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,200
I was in utter shock.

93
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:37,310
I felt so paralyzed by this point,

94
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:41,140
with this understanding that this
realization that the greats Eddie lead,

95
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:45,350
the great person that I thought I was
wasn't really as great as I really was.

96
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:51,100
And it was in that moment of revelation
that I started to see that my life was

97
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,350
only so temporary.
I am weak then I am broken.

98
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:58,670
I am full of sin.

99
00:06:58,671 --> 00:07:03,671
That there was nothing in me that
inherently maybe deserves and slot.

100
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,360
Wait,
you gave it to me anyways.

101
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:11,730
It was only in this moment of weakness
did I start to finally understand what

102
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:15,300
the power of the father's
love really means to us.

103
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:19,500
It's the most powerful expression
of love that you can ever experience

104
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:24,220
and action you.
Dave,

105
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,280
I really believe that this story,
look 15 isn't really adopt the sun.

106
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:34,440
It's really all about the fog.

107
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:40,310
It's about how loving and gracious
he was to this rebellious time.

108
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:46,030
Interesting thing about the story is
that, you know, we focus on son's journey.

109
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,200
Let me see his suffering.

110
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:50,200
You see the fact that she becomes
homeless and this is office money.

111
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:54,730
But what we don't is that this father
is also suffering. That's from,

112
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:55,501
of course,

113
00:07:55,501 --> 00:08:00,501
he's a loving father and it tears him
up inside just watching his son destroy

114
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:02,300
himself.

115
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:06,980
The reason why the father's paying
assault salt pork sun only realizes the

116
00:08:06,981 --> 00:08:09,550
father's love,
the father's name,

117
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:14,590
what a father can give for his son in
order to teach him the life lesson.

118
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:18,630
We don't realize it until later on, but
you know, the whole life journey is to,

119
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:23,100
to find ourselves through our hardships.

120
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,970
I made a lot of mistakes in life and uh,
it's good to know that no matter,

121
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:29,750
no matter how many mistakes you made,

122
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:35,440
there's always somebody who
willing to still accept you.

123
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:41,290
Forgive him.
I'm lucky enough to happen.

124
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:46,350
Given the second chance to know what
makes a story so powerful is the reality

125
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:51,780
that at the end of the day,
the sun never really did spot,

126
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:57,930
but the father chose to die for his
son because his love for him was really

127
00:09:00,931 --> 00:09:02,880
unconditional.
It's the expression of love.

128
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:09,510
It's an expression of selflessness
or selfless, seemingly foolish,

129
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,380
so many truly radical,
truly life changing.

130
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:19,320
And what we hope that people will take
away from this film is this idea that

131
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:24,510
that love is still today and that will
be able to experience that love even just

132
00:09:24,511 --> 00:09:27,650
cuts a piece of that love.
Your lights will be so much.

133
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,210
Yeah, I know how to
take care of babies. No,

134
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:46,110
we'd have to make a cameo in there.
We do videos. You've got to look at

135
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,020
the prodigal to bleed project.

136
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:06,400
We're very excited to announce a national
tour in 2014 to premiere some of our

137
00:10:06,401 --> 00:10:10,840
upcoming videos and on this tour we'll
also be sharing our personal story behind

138
00:10:10,841 --> 00:10:14,650
jubilee project and what inspires
us to do what we do. That's right.

139
00:10:14,651 --> 00:10:17,830
So if you want updates on the tour or
if you want us to come to your score or

140
00:10:17,831 --> 00:10:21,280
your church started as 2014 tour,
