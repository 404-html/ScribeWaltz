1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:02,073
Hey,

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:10,000
so this was the big issue that
Julie probably has ever had.

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:15,250
We had about 40 crew members
over 80 cast members.

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,980
Um,
and it was just absolutely insane.

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,550
I was insanely fun for all of the sand.

6
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:26,490
It was just such a humbling experience
to be able to work with such talented,

7
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:30,910
um, and amazing people. Um, honestly,

8
00:00:30,911 --> 00:00:34,780
this film could not have been
possible without my amazing team.

9
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,130
This is a very deeply
personal story for me. Um,

10
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:44,550
and it's something that I care so
much about and I am so humbled and

11
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:50,620
appreciative of everyone who were able
to come together or we just feel really

12
00:00:50,621 --> 00:00:52,780
fortunate because jubilee project came to,

13
00:00:52,781 --> 00:00:57,310
I get the opportunity to have the stories
Alzheimer's disease told through their

14
00:00:57,311 --> 00:00:58,144
wonderful work.

15
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:02,700
So our hope is that it'll continue to
raise awareness and raise involvement,

16
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:06,420
hit more people drawn to our services
and more people supporting the word.

17
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:10,870
Uh, my name's Jason Today.
I am the one eight D,

18
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:15,600
which means I'm the main person on set
and screams at everyone as how's or one

19
00:01:15,601 --> 00:01:17,790
that they're late and behind schedule.

20
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,430
This is my angry face
when we're behind on time.

21
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:30,470
Hi, I'm Rachel. I am the, it's
been a good student so far.

22
00:01:30,471 --> 00:01:35,270
Everybody has been super on top of
things and really, really well behaved,

23
00:01:35,271 --> 00:01:36,170
very talented.

24
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,120
So it has been a very easy process to
work with everybody. You have a great,

25
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:44,340
fantastic, great crew, great parents, um,

26
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,750
people really willing to
open up locations for us.

27
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,720
And there's a good time,

28
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:55,270
Rachel,
first time producing a film,

29
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:59,670
but I had a great director to work easy.
Come on please.

30
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:01,620
They cast and crew there is,

31
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:06,340
she got so many compliments about how
organized this production was and like

32
00:02:06,341 --> 00:02:08,950
people who've been on sets for really,
really long time.

33
00:02:08,951 --> 00:02:13,951
Like Joe Joe said that this is really
organized of all the films I've worked on,

34
00:02:15,371 --> 00:02:18,250
this was the most organized.
Wow.

35
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:22,820
I am Robert.
I am the gaffer.

36
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,230
I am doing pretty much all
of the lighting, setting
up all the lighting here.

37
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:31,850
And uh, it's a smaller crew.
So you said there's no grip.

38
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,090
So,
uh,

39
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:38,130
some kind of doing the grip department
and the electric department with Marshall

40
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:39,763
DP,
obviously

41
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:50,730
they are just evil.

42
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:56,860
No slave labor work 50 hours a day,

43
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:57,890
um,

44
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:02,890
as as well possible because you can see
by this kids they were all wiped out.

45
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:14,950
A very big thank you to yes
style.com for sponsoring.

46
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:18,980
Um, all this amazing clothing. Um,

47
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,730
you guys really came through.

48
00:03:21,731 --> 00:03:26,500
I had so much fun going through your
site and you're picking out some awesome

49
00:03:26,501 --> 00:03:28,240
pieces for our after Joe.

50
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,480
We really wanted him to look refined,

51
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:36,760
dapper and have a little bit of

52
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:43,690
personality in this club
performance has been unreal. Um,

53
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:48,910
both, uh, Joe and today I had just
really comes in body. Their character.

54
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:52,810
They're no longer actors.
They are Arthur and the melody.

55
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,660
So this is pretty much
my first acting sharp.

56
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:01,140
How do you like it?
I love it.

57
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:05,490
Do you like the character melody?
Yes.

58
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,830
What do you like about her?

59
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:13,330
She seems very nice and she cares a
lot for grandpa and I also always like,

60
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:19,680
like characters dance.
I started dancing

61
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,330
like training when I was seven years old,

62
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:29,550
but my mom put me in classes since
I was three. Makes me feel good,

63
00:04:29,551 --> 00:04:33,360
especially better. Amber.
Maybe I had a bad day.

64
00:04:33,361 --> 00:04:34,670
Sometimes I just,

65
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:41,750
I think everybody should dance because
it makes everybody feel better.

66
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:47,870
And it's a way to express your
emotions through movement and exercise.

67
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:55,170
What was it like working with surveyor?

68
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:02,790
We hit it off. We had a good
time. How many she was trying
to braid my hair today.

69
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:09,230
You saw, why did it make me
look like a Unicorn? But no,

70
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:13,580
she's great. She's a great little
actress and a great person.

71
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:14,810
She really is.

72
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:20,050
And I think it's important to show how
a child react in it showed her in a very

73
00:05:22,461 --> 00:05:27,461
positive light helping your grandfather
and it showed a love between two

74
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:32,480
generations,
did it pretty far apart.

75
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:36,380
It can really work

76
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,970
if you love each other.
Oh sweet.

77
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:48,160
The worst part is when you feel like
you did it right and it says miss

78
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:54,300
also,
uh,

79
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:04,763
go back

80
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,553
to

81
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,233
go

82
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,153
box

83
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,093
right

84
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:26,950
now,

85
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:53,480
the crew and cast that we worked with

86
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:04,510
those your first phone.
Thank you.

87
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:06,370
You were so good

88
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,850
and

89
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,120
you're awesome

90
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,113
fun

91
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:42,423
and

92
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:48,140
really grateful for being a part of it.

93
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:52,790
So this story is inspired
by my grandfather.

94
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:55,980
My grandfather raised me when I was

95
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:00,000
just the baby because my parents
were, um, out of the country working.

96
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,430
And so I grew really close with them, but
he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's, uh,

97
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:09,470
several years ago and he got to a point
where he no longer even recognize me

98
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,490
anymore. Um, and so I didn't
really know how to respond.

99
00:09:14,491 --> 00:09:16,560
I essentially just kind
of ran away from him,

100
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:21,270
even stopped caring for him until one day.
Um,

101
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,800
we're just sitting in the same room
and I hear him mumbling and I lean in

102
00:09:25,801 --> 00:09:26,634
closer.

103
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:31,740
And what I heard was this
absolutely amazing story
that he was trying to tell me

104
00:09:31,741 --> 00:09:35,780
about the time that he was fighting this
war and in 1940 [inaudible] and using,

105
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:39,360
being pushed down into the south end to
these caves and had nowhere else to turn.

106
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:42,630
And I was amazed. I was
stunned. I was like, wow,

107
00:09:42,631 --> 00:09:44,980
this is my grandfather who,
you know,

108
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:47,850
can't even remember what he had
for dinner the night before,

109
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:53,030
but being able to share this really rich
and personal history that he had many

110
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:53,910
decades ago.

111
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:58,800
And that was really the turning point
in which I saw him as a different person

112
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:04,050
as my grandfather again.
And that taught me a lot about him,

113
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:06,420
um,
about someone with Alzheimer's,

114
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:09,870
even though they lost their memories,

115
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,320
they still have capacity to feel love and
their emotions outlast their memories.

116
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:20,520
Ultimately, the main takeaway for
this film is to live what you love.

117
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:25,470
For every one of us, um,
we have that passion.

118
00:10:25,471 --> 00:10:28,110
We have that drive that
really makes us come alive.

119
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,880
And so that's why I believe that
ultimately this is a story about love. Um,

120
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:35,450
and it's important to live what you love,
um,

121
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,320
because that's what at the end of
the day truly helps us come alive.

122
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:44,220
And that's what melody and Arthur to
do for each other. What happens is

123
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:48,570
this, this dance scene is the last scene
of a film in which the granddaughter,

124
00:10:48,571 --> 00:10:52,200
her name is melody, is on the stage
and she's dancing in the talent show,

125
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:54,740
but she ends up messing up
and she falls in the grounds.

126
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:59,520
And what happens is the Grandpa to
show her his support stands up in the

127
00:10:59,521 --> 00:11:02,130
audience and search the stance.
And,

128
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,290
and slowly one by one different groups
of people will start joining him as this,

129
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,370
as a sign of solidarity

130
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:18,830
strap.
