1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,150
Ricky,
where are you at with your training today?

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:08,200
You now I'm down $902 and how
much money have you made so far?

3
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:09,490
Uh,

4
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:10,600
like five bucks.

5
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,750
I think the idea of like what
money means to me, it has changed.

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:20,970
I passed that milestone.
I like becoming a military late 2007

7
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:25,460
Tim.
I think money doesn't mean too much to me.

8
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:29,210
I don't think we need as
much of it as we think we do.

9
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:34,040
People do find it hard to talk
about money because it's so private.

10
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:35,960
It's like talking about underwear.

11
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:42,783
Okay.

12
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:45,860
What is going on everyone? It's Turkey
with a lot of planning profit. Ah,

13
00:00:45,861 --> 00:00:49,840
yesterday covered profits at 63 31 today.

14
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:53,590
During pre market hours
it hit highs of $69

15
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:59,870
my name is Reiki Gutierrez. I'm 23 years
old and I live in Gilbert, Arizona.

16
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:04,700
What I do for living is investing in
the stock market. I'm an influencer.

17
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:09,400
I own a series of real estate
properties and I run a series of online

18
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:10,243
businesses.

19
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,720
Do you roughly know how much
weight you make annually? Yeah.

20
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:21,640
So I've put this year with a different,
probably Chris that we have going on.

21
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,520
I can probably bring in
lights six to 7 million.

22
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:40,140
My name is Azariah Randall and I'm
21 years old and I live in San Diego,

23
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:43,230
California.
What do I do for a living?

24
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,870
I primarily deliver food.

25
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,230
Sign up for this food delivery APP.

26
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:52,350
And how much do you see you make?
Like on average

27
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,640
I can make like easily like a hundred and

28
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,910
hope you guys all have an amazing rest
of your day. Continue working hard,

29
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:03,210
continue to fall in James.
Let your passion be a in
your success like ours. Guys,

30
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,760
let's make sure that we end the year
on a green note. Take it as a team.

31
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:10,980
How did you do just in that session?
Um, as in trading, not very good.

32
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,220
So I'm down about 1% in big picture.
Like it's not much,

33
00:02:14,221 --> 00:02:18,630
it's just because I'm right now invested
with about $30,000 boom, boom, boom.

34
00:02:18,631 --> 00:02:19,620
What's going on guys?

35
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:23,820
I made a mistake and I covered
profits yesterday on you yas and luck.

36
00:02:23,821 --> 00:02:24,654
What I missed out on.

37
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:32,190
We have these here at the Ra there.
I have my other GGR over there.

38
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:38,020
I own that house to my favorite part of
the day is working with my private group

39
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,400
and seen the excitement that they
give back is probably one of the most

40
00:02:43,981 --> 00:02:44,814
rewarding things.

41
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:49,500
My goal is to create a series of
applications that are worth hundreds of

42
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,860
millions if not billions of
dollars. Right. I think if I had

43
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:58,700
$10 billion in my pocket right now,
I think I would still be the same person.

44
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:04,540
I have a stronger relationship with
my faith. Matthew six and 21 says,

45
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:06,580
wherever your treasure is,
the desires of your heart,

46
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,380
we'll be also what is going on everyone.

47
00:03:10,381 --> 00:03:12,660
I'm going to be packaging some
orders for tech with apparel.

48
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,570
She's just saying your parents to Europe.
Yeah,

49
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,830
so they went for I think a total of
like 24 days. Did you buy your trance?

50
00:03:19,831 --> 00:03:22,530
A water thing and you tell me that
they like ass or needs something.

51
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:27,960
Like I'll be like paying
my little sister's tuition
for our university and then

52
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:32,970
anytime that they like running low
or something, then I can assess. But

53
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,500
what's up Instagram? You'll look. It's
a good day. We got, we got John here.

54
00:03:37,501 --> 00:03:40,830
He's following me around all day
pretending that my life is interesting.

55
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:41,893
It might be dirty

56
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:47,390
and I'm not willing to say

57
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:53,240
so much beside them is that they should
pay me break. Let's make perfect.

58
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,260
I'm pregnant. This baby it Brett
does make perfect. I'll bring,

59
00:03:55,261 --> 00:03:57,560
this is baby that I miss daisy.

60
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:03,060
Oh, we got to delivery. We got the text
messages. We're going to the broken yolk.

61
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:04,740
Will you do the down here on steaks?

62
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:18,090
Cool.
Got Room for two of us in here.

63
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:21,380
Hi.
Bye.

64
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,373
Yeah,
no problem.

65
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,020
What's going on? Twitter is how many of
you guys has never won. It's a tracker.

66
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:43,190
Today's compete with your friends
and see what was the, oh my gosh.

67
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:48,880
Reiki. Where are you at with your
trading today? Do you know? I'm down.

68
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:50,351
Oh my God.

69
00:04:50,351 --> 00:04:55,351
I actually more than I thought
$902 you sweat that at all or no,

70
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,840
because like I've been down like $2,000
and I recovers and I make like $3,000 on

71
00:05:01,331 --> 00:05:02,164
it.
So,

72
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:20,290
so right now as you can see, we don't
have any delivery, so we're waiting,

73
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,850
playing the waiting
game. It's Kinda, it's,

74
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,960
it's like when you text your crush and
then you're waiting for her to text you

75
00:05:25,961 --> 00:05:27,100
back.
But she never does.

76
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:31,500
Honestly,
I think I messed up in this position.

77
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:38,260
I'm someone that like I,
I value the dollar so much.

78
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:41,410
Like you saw me go to chipolte
that and I won't get a drink.

79
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,400
I just became very food or from a very
early age and very aware of how to try to

80
00:05:47,501 --> 00:05:52,420
pick money and the stress that it
brings on and seeing how it acted as a

81
00:05:52,421 --> 00:05:54,880
negative catalyst for my
parents' relationship.

82
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:00,560
We went to Mcdonald's and I overheard
that by parents weren't doing as well

83
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,570
financially. And my cousin was like, oh,
I want a big Mac and I want large fries.

84
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:07,160
I like looked at him and I was like,
no, don't get that. Like, you know,

85
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,520
just because of the extra cost.
That's when I really started to,

86
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:15,740
you don't try to buy it and sell like
snicker bars or power rates just to pay

87
00:06:15,741 --> 00:06:17,690
for myself.
So my parents didn't have to pay me.

88
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,833
Okay.

89
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:25,450
That one's going to pay like
nine bucks at Asia walk less go.

90
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah. To dagger
February Seafood Delight.

91
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:30,660
How's that grows and a egg flour soup.

92
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:31,603
Yeah.
Awesome.

93
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:36,600
The order is Hella big.

94
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,080
Waiting round two

95
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,200
when I was growing up we were,
we are good financially up until my age,

96
00:06:54,201 --> 00:06:58,940
like seven I guess I would say that was
when my mom was like a single mom to me

97
00:06:58,941 --> 00:06:59,840
and my two sisters.

98
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:04,340
We didn't know we were poor or like broke
or anything because my mom did such a

99
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:06,620
good job of hiding it and just
like grinding and hustling.

100
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,630
But then like growing up I kind of did
understand like our financial hardships,

101
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:18,170
look how much we got
paid for that 35 bucks.

102
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:21,390
Cause that's like with the
fat tip and whatnot. Yeah.

103
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:30,510
It's exciting. So what happened? Um,

104
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:31,990
she says she's missing an item.

105
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:36,190
Yes. I'm so sorry. Yes. It's another
part of your order. We have it back here.

106
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:39,490
There's three salads.
Right. Okay. Thank you.

107
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:45,850
How many of you guys wants to turn
your passion for cars and to profit?

108
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:50,170
We are reopening the 30 day mentorship
challenge we sold out last time in three

109
00:07:50,171 --> 00:07:52,420
days. All you have to do now
is swipe up to learn more.

110
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:57,630
Uh, I got terrible news. They don't have
the tomato and Mozzarella Panini, but

111
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:59,540
do you have,
so

112
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:04,080
I think if this building right here

113
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:08,010
is 20 to 30 yeah,
no problem.

114
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:20,190
Yeah, it's been super
slow for like an hour. Um,

115
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:23,940
probably won't get any more orders just
because we're downtown and everybody's

116
00:08:23,941 --> 00:08:27,630
probably like on their way home already
right now. Yeah, we'll just call it a day.

117
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:34,883
Cool.

118
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:40,303
Okay.

119
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:50,160
Do you think the money
defines people to you?

120
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,270
I think, I think in today's world, um,

121
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:57,270
money definitely does have a,

122
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,570
a huge form of credibility.

123
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:05,260
I believe money can
define you if you let it.

124
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:08,230
I don't believe it defines
me personally at all.

125
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:14,430
I've had like 27 cents in my bank account
and also have had like $3,000 in my

126
00:09:15,881 --> 00:09:17,830
checking account. It was just
like ready to ball out, you know?

127
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,050
And I was the same exact person.

128
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,340
Does money buy happiness?

129
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:29,740
No actual names or when someone who does
not buy happiness, I try this quick one.

130
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:35,920
Are you happy? I'd say I know
definitely. I'm very happy with,

131
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:41,230
there's no reason not to be happy,
right. With where it is that I am. Um,

132
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,330
but there's definitely moments that

133
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:49,810
feels like kind of, I kind
of know, just like empty.

134
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,210
I think money can't buy happiness,

135
00:09:56,690 --> 00:10:01,690
but it can only buy either temporary
happiness or things that make you happy.

136
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:09,970
I am. I'm very happy. It's,
it's weird. I'm like smiling,

137
00:10:09,971 --> 00:10:13,690
answering that and like, I like struggle
with depression and stuff, so it's weird,

138
00:10:13,691 --> 00:10:16,390
but it's like,
like I'm very freaking happen.

139
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,960
All right.

140
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,960
You always come through with,

141
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:28,280
what's your name again?

142
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:39,320
Can you trace any of
your income from today?

143
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:44,020
Yeah, with everything. Um, I'd
say probably around about 11,000.

144
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,670
11,000.
Yeah.

145
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:51,220
So what is it that you like to say?

146
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:54,650
Oh um, you know, continue working
hard, continue to fall into James,

147
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:58,640
like your passion, be what your abs
and your success. Um, and like always,

148
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:01,920
let's make sure that when
the year on every note to go

149
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:08,330
has Orion. Hey, make some noise
for me if he broke all right,

150
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,140
y'all didn't hesitate it. You're all
getting robbed by the end of this. Yeah.

151
00:11:11,141 --> 00:11:15,520
Today the day we made six while we
were out in like almost five hours,

152
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:19,990
which is like 12 bucks an hour.
I think minimum wage is like 1150.

153
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,440
I would like to be making more money
and I'm trying to figure out ways to do

154
00:11:23,441 --> 00:11:27,960
that. People have lately been telling me.
I'm funny. I found that out recently. Um,

155
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:30,550
so that's part of the reason I
started doing standup comedy.

156
00:11:30,551 --> 00:11:31,960
I can definitely make people laugh.

157
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:40,270
We've got the light hits you. I know,
right? He may have a, but write the check,

158
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:41,403
right?
The chick,

159
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:48,260
all my friends that graduated high school
just graduated college and I'm like,

160
00:11:48,261 --> 00:11:52,250
Dang, they broke. They
like 120,000 in debt.

161
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:57,060
I'm just like 2000 and debt,
you feel me? So we didn't,

162
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:59,480
we can all read books you don't need like.
