1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:06,830
My name is Skye Hodge. I'm a producer
and working with people such as logic.

2
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:10,160
I need k Kendrick.
Pretty much everybody from

3
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:17,630
Medallia. Oh hey angel. Hi.

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:22,610
This is sky sky.
Sky Meet you.

5
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,400
So, uh, what do you do? I'm an
opera singer. Wow. Yeah. Nice.

6
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:36,430
How long have you been doing
all your life? All my life.

7
00:00:36,431 --> 00:00:37,650
It's like all I've wanted to do with,

8
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,910
see I'm actually getting
ready to go to Singapore.

9
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:44,110
She doing the opera called
Lavo him. Wow. How Nice.

10
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:45,443
Okay.

11
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:47,603
Dope.

12
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:55,610
Have you been here before?

13
00:00:56,090 --> 00:01:00,770
Yes, I work out of here a lot. The great
company. They're like a culture hub.

14
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,980
I usually, my mind is, my
forte of course is the studio.

15
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:08,120
Where are we going to be there? So
no life though. So many events here.

16
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:09,320
This is the studio,

17
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:11,423
so,

18
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:20,050
so I don't know anything
about this set up.

19
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,490
What would be the first
thing that you do with it?

20
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,640
This is like off the top of my head,

21
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:29,670
I will more so as like if
there's a certain song that
touches you that you would

22
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:34,390
be able to sing and then
we can like record it.

23
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:37,360
And then I can just drop it in or
should it be something original?

24
00:01:37,361 --> 00:01:39,370
What do you think that should be?
Our starting point,

25
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:41,440
Austin is to get comfortable.
Okay.

26
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:45,340
Knock that out and van from there know.

27
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:53,410
Ooh. Okay. No.

28
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:59,190
Oh,
oh,

29
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:03,160
oh

30
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,373
okay.

31
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,073
Hello.

32
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,333
Cool.

33
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:32,993
What?

34
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:42,090
Thank you.
That was incredible.

35
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,190
So now that we got that right,
what I did was take your vocals,

36
00:02:51,191 --> 00:02:52,830
chopped it up. I got it in here, right?

37
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,863
Yeah.

38
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:58,580
I can also down pitch it.
Ooh,

39
00:02:59,110 --> 00:02:59,943
that's really cool.

40
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:02,283
So now,

41
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:11,740
okay,

42
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,650
ah,
ah,

43
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,960
try when have the regular but

44
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,543
regular.

45
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:44,380
Hey man, listen to pro gets a
cold pro coproduction oh is that,

46
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:48,080
is that how people get it?
One suggestion in the middle of doing it.

47
00:03:48,081 --> 00:03:50,980
If you're like, Yo, when we just do
this and maybe flip it like this.

48
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,790
You know what I'm saying?
Cause I'm in a certain zone.

49
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:57,620
But you probably here because you're on
outside looking in. Okay. So you know

50
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:06,950
for me there's so much about the
person that has to be, I guess no,

51
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:10,850
you know, or discovered to even
be able to create something. Yeah.

52
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's crazy cause I'm like one of my
brothers just recently passed this past

53
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:22,320
October, so I'm going to stay like
you do. I deal with him all the way,

54
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:27,350
but at the same time I know for sure
Halan want me to sit here and soak all

55
00:04:28,321 --> 00:04:31,770
freaking day. I think I've
cried out as much as I can cry.

56
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:36,771
So now it's more so like just utilizing
his energy to just kind of push forward

57
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:42,470
and become who I need to be in his life.

58
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,820
My hat is off to you
though because that's not,

59
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:49,910
that's not easy cause I mean my dad
passed away and I was 22 I mean I stopped

60
00:04:49,921 --> 00:04:50,754
singing for about,

61
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:55,020
I mean not very long but probably for
about a good six to seven months and I

62
00:04:55,021 --> 00:04:58,410
couldn't do anything. So I mean if
you can, yeah, I mean it's hard.

63
00:04:58,411 --> 00:05:00,420
Don't get me wrong.
Do you want to,

64
00:05:00,421 --> 00:05:02,280
you want us to like a song
that we're doing today?

65
00:05:02,281 --> 00:05:05,820
Do you want something to be about
him? We can. I should. I don't know.

66
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:10,140
I didn't have any prerequisites of
what is going on. I'm just like,

67
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:13,740
whatever vibes happen, it happened. Like

68
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,273
no pain.

69
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,380
I hear you.

70
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,670
Eh?

71
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:43,540
Okay.

72
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:47,330
Deep with him still.

73
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:49,230
Hey,

74
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,660
what did I say?

75
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:14,543
Okay.

76
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:20,220
We're all talking about experiences
that we've had in our lives.

77
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,220
Sky recently lost his brother.
I've lost my dad.

78
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:27,690
I am a musician because of my dad.
Maybe that's why I sing so much.

79
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:32,430
Maybe that's why I'm so invested.
Just a being able to,

80
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:36,120
to share how we deal with those losses,

81
00:06:36,121 --> 00:06:41,060
that comradery Barton advise to when
we got to create it. Just kind of it.

82
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,253
It clicked.

83
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:53,040
I mean, sure. You want to hear?
Yes, right. Let's do this. Ready?

84
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:01,613
Hi.

85
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,920
I need you close to.

86
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:48,283
Oh,

87
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,213
hope.

88
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,510
Oh.
