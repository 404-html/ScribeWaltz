1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:01,393
Yeah.

2
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:58,543
What,

3
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,193
what his mind.

4
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:16,400
My dream is to make it a music. My
passion. I want to go to school for music,

5
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:20,910
so when I'm going to get my prostheses,
I'm going to be able to walk upright.

6
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:25,310
I'm going to to walk straight.
My dream is to have a home.

7
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,000
Pretty simple. I have a home, a job.

8
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:36,830
My dream is to be alive. Breathe, survive.

9
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:42,350
You're treated with
disrespect when a person

10
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,320
90% of the time.

11
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:49,330
It's given me a lot of
information and a lot of things

12
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:56,710
for when this ends because I think
differently than I did before about being

13
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:00,830
African American,
living in the United States of America.

14
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,020
I do not believe in the system.

15
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:07,370
It's not built for me to have esteem
about myself and everything that's already

16
00:02:07,371 --> 00:02:09,950
set up in place is already
built in Meijer for you.

17
00:02:09,951 --> 00:02:12,710
The hate crimes throw the
lack of proper education,

18
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:18,640
the lack of preparedness based on what
this country is supposed to provide in

19
00:02:18,981 --> 00:02:23,270
this land of opportunity. I don't see
too much opportunity here in skid row.

20
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:25,330
Skid row is a place where you come.

21
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:29,150
A lot of times when you
launch or your dreams,

22
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:34,370
you come here because all the resources
are supposedly here so you could get

23
00:02:34,371 --> 00:02:35,570
your life back together.

24
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:40,370
But then they are the negative elements
here on skid row that can pull you back

25
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,360
into that old life.
So it's hard for you to dream.

26
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:49,610
I addiction if you crack cocaine with jive

27
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:56,130
for absolutely.
Years ago now,

28
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:59,320
I began after the to 25.

29
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:04,600
It's screwed up in a heroin.
Heroin, been a heroin addict.

30
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:08,163
Blue.

31
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:13,940
I had to come up sometimes.
I uh,

32
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:16,240
my past

33
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:25,880
and
the,

34
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:31,390
I just overdosed last year. I was
in a coma for two weeks. I got out.

35
00:03:31,391 --> 00:03:32,830
It took me five months to
learn how to walk again.

36
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:36,280
And I've been trying to learn how to walk,
but I again,

37
00:03:36,281 --> 00:03:37,240
I can't really do it that well.

38
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,280
It's hard.
She naps

39
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:46,250
all kinds of substances at a control.

40
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,660
A lot of people here aren't in this
situation. They want to be here.

41
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:54,643
Nine g

42
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:59,550
CMIT Oh,

43
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,810
few people about the situation down here.

44
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:07,310
My dream is to become a pastor because
I feel like God has called me to that.

45
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,550
And to actually reach out to people
that have gone through what I've gone

46
00:04:10,551 --> 00:04:11,570
through right now.

47
00:04:11,571 --> 00:04:15,080
My dream is to help others know that
not go through the same trials and

48
00:04:15,081 --> 00:04:15,914
tribulations.

49
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:20,360
I just want to make our
life so that he can grow up.

50
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,710
We live in our own house,
own yard on that.

51
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:28,110
We're not all beggars down
and we're not all people that,

52
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,380
that asking for a handout.

53
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:34,340
We're asking for help and
assistance with what we want to do.

54
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,670
We want to do it for ourselves,
but we can't do it without help.

55
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:39,640
People minimize

56
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:44,850
and see whether it's a
little bit different than the
shanty town. What'd you pay?

57
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:49,300
But you know some type of pain and
say, well, this person's payments

58
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:54,740
throughout this whole 50 black community,
what I see is homelessness.

59
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:59,990
Why even seen hopelessness?
But one thing that is present in every,

60
00:04:59,991 --> 00:05:04,460
each and every one of us is dreams and
there's a whole lot of dreams here in

61
00:05:04,461 --> 00:05:05,294
skid row.

62
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,670
It's important to dream dreams because
that's what wakes you up in the morning.

63
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:13,260
That's what gets you out of bed.
That's what makes you walk.

64
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:18,720
But one thing. Find the other
end, aspire to get anywhere. Um,

65
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,920
faith. Hope. That's the only thing
that keeps me going. Sometimes that's,

66
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:25,320
that's my fuel. And the only thing
I'm running on half the time.

67
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,480
And that's why the dreams
and the people here,

68
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,050
so what people can do

69
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:38,570
is listen to our voice is
two sides to every story.

70
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:40,520
Just hear both sides from being your

71
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:58,420
here we have fantastic.

72
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,263
Well,

73
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:05,270
we have the technological possibility
of making everybody on her.

74
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,320
The joy of an independent.

75
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:20,190
Yeah.
