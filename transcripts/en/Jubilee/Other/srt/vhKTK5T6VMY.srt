1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,490
Never have I ever checked you out

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:04,220
while you were changing.

3
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:13,190
You checked me out though,
did it?

4
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:23,580
I haven't seen you in ages. Oh No.
It's just been like 10 minutes.

5
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:28,680
My name is Jonathan.
I am 25 my name is Maddie.

6
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,010
I'm 28 seven. I what? That was all hard.

7
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:35,610
I've actually known
him before he was born,

8
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:40,500
but we didn't really hang out up until
like he moved in. I think so. Yeah.

9
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:45,420
You go first here. Let's do it. It

10
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,950
never have I ever made
you clean up my mess.

11
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,560
Three, two, one.

12
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:00,850
That time when I got really sick.
Oh,

13
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:06,100
I never seen come from anyone lives.

14
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:10,990
It was like you were like, you were being
exercise. It was just like how like,

15
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:15,390
like you are this really gross,
but I really appreciate it.

16
00:01:15,391 --> 00:01:19,170
You guys for that though. I
love you man. So I do the same.

17
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:24,630
I think for me, uh, it's definitely the
dishes, dude. I do my dishes all the time,

18
00:01:24,631 --> 00:01:26,490
but sometimes you get lazy.

19
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:28,280
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

20
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,720
Never have I ever hit on your friends,

21
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,230
Yo, man, you bring the girls all the time.

22
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:43,250
When we're supposed to do I just
want to sit there and be quiet now.

23
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,170
I wouldn't be able to. Oh, I haven't.

24
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,720
Mainly because I haven't really met a
lot of like you don't bring friends that

25
00:01:49,721 --> 00:01:52,200
are on the light. Right. Cause I
figured you guys would hit on him.

26
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,800
So honestly I'm not surprised though.
Like I

27
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:03,990
give it to me, give it to me. Never
have I ever pretended not to be home.

28
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:05,130
So you wouldn't talk to me.

29
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:14,440
Wait, really? I mean like

30
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:18,730
you guys are family to me. You know
I was, I grew up an only child.

31
00:02:18,731 --> 00:02:23,731
So being able to have a roommate or a
group of roommates that are like that are

32
00:02:24,941 --> 00:02:27,770
like family to me. Like that's dope. God,

33
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:32,410
thanks for making me feel like now I
don't go to like extremes in pretending

34
00:02:32,411 --> 00:02:34,350
like I don't go into the closet and
close off the lines of hope. Like,

35
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:37,480
oh I hope they don't
notice I don't do that.

36
00:02:37,481 --> 00:02:41,440
But now there's times when you know,
you just want to be just like, man,

37
00:02:41,441 --> 00:02:44,950
I feel like I'd be not a good
person to talk to you right now.

38
00:02:44,951 --> 00:02:49,240
So I stay away no matter what.
Like if you guys wanted to talk to me,

39
00:02:49,241 --> 00:02:51,820
even if it feels like it, should
they? Yeah. I mean I feel the same.

40
00:02:51,821 --> 00:02:52,654
I'm still all ears.

41
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:55,100
Yeah.
Damn

42
00:02:55,970 --> 00:03:00,340
bond they're not is man. Let's do it.

43
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,470
We're going deep now.

44
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:10,390
Never have I ever checked you
out while you were changing.

45
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:18,770
You checked me out though. Did like
we're an apartment of guys like, yeah.

46
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,130
How thins check your arms and your
hands. Want to see it. Some progress,

47
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,820
the gym and all that steak objectively,

48
00:03:24,821 --> 00:03:27,340
I feel we're all good looking
people in the apartment,

49
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,300
so like you're trying to see if another
bonding moment. It's a bonding moment

50
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:35,950
and then let's just say we
know each other too well.

51
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:38,980
Okay.

52
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,510
Never have I ever lied to you.

53
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:46,630
Okay. Three, two, one.

54
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:53,870
I was like, boy, you got to
lie right here, Huh? Yes.

55
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,700
Yes.
Someone's,

56
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:59,990
you've lied to everyone at some point
in life like you're talking about like

57
00:03:59,991 --> 00:04:03,930
white lies. Yeah, exactly.
Okay. Okay. Then let me ask you,

58
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,690
what's the biggest lie
you've ever told me then

59
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:09,783
I was okay.

60
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,090
Oh, you asked me about my
mental health. Gotcha. Yeah.

61
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,010
Cause I guess at the point I was
just trying to be like I was,

62
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:21,730
I just wanted to get through stuff on
my own aggression. That's understood.

63
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:23,940
I didn't want it to,
I didn't want to trouble you guys,

64
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,600
which I guess is stupid in mice.
Right.

65
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,470
Cause I don't have real trouble
when you're even when you knew.

66
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:32,780
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

67
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:38,250
I definitely lied to you for sure. Yeah.
You know, white lies and all that stuff.

68
00:04:38,251 --> 00:04:40,680
And the same thing when you guys
asked me how I'm doing whatever.

69
00:04:40,681 --> 00:04:44,520
Sometimes I lie because I don't
want to get into it or whatever. Um,

70
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:46,163
I mean for you,

71
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:50,460
I'm glad that we were able
to like eventually like I
was able to eventually get

72
00:04:50,461 --> 00:04:54,510
past that and able to, I
guess truly open up. Yeah.

73
00:04:56,070 --> 00:05:00,210
Never have I ever been jealous of you.

74
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,380
Three, two, one. All right.

75
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:13,290
[inaudible] all these
chips that jut Pam module.

76
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,500
Okay. Why are you jealous of that? Because
you want to go right? I'll go next time.

77
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,240
We're going next time.
All right. I'm just like,

78
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,660
I'm sure we're eventually
going to put you in a suitcase.

79
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:31,080
You don't have enough money.
I guess it's my turn. Huh?

80
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,320
What are you doing?
Why the fuck are you so good looking dude,

81
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,990
I'm sorry.
I'm not doing,

82
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:49,110
I think you're,
you're a smart guy and a all that stuff.

83
00:05:49,111 --> 00:05:51,990
So when you do work on like, you know, you
probably do this stuff. I was like, man,

84
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,940
I admire then, but yeah. Cool. I'll
take you on next week. Let's do it.

85
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,350
Let's do it.
Let's see what's happening.

86
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:04,250
Never have I ever been
ashamed to tell you something.

87
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,760
Three, two, one.

88
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:19,440
You remember that time when
I had broken up with my ex?

89
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:20,700
Yeah.
Yeah Dude.

90
00:06:20,701 --> 00:06:23,310
I was definitely a shame to tell you guys
that I was still hanging out with her.

91
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,530
Um, and it was like selective, you know,

92
00:06:25,531 --> 00:06:28,020
it was like I would only
come to you because um,

93
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:32,260
those are things I could
tell you. Yeah. I mean I get,

94
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:36,090
that's why like I was always there for
you whenever you wanted to talk. You were,

95
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,350
yeah. I'm glad that you feel
comfortable coming to me,

96
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:45,750
us, that stuff kind of is my team.

97
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:49,390
It is your turn. Trying
to drag it out. Shaved

98
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:53,820
things I've been ashamed of.

99
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:59,030
I guess it would be like when I had
that in my shame to tell us that

100
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:08,940
no one's ever really proud of when
they're not in a good mental spot. Right.

101
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:14,640
I knew I could come to you guys and
with that kind of stuff, but it's still,

102
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:19,320
it's still something you're
kind of ashamed of. Nah, man,

103
00:07:19,321 --> 00:07:24,030
you shouldn't feel ashamed, man. That's
what we're here for. Yeah. Like I said,

104
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,860
yeah. Like I, like I said to Peter, man,

105
00:07:25,861 --> 00:07:30,040
it's what would I do without
you exactly what I mean. And,

106
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,360
and I hope you can say the
same thing to you know, is now,

107
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:36,480
it really is like you brought up on a
really great point where it's just like

108
00:07:36,481 --> 00:07:41,310
all those times where, where would I be
if you were gone and stuff like that.

109
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:45,510
Or if any of my roommates, yeah. Dude,

110
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:48,840
I tell you like we're pretty
lucky in that sense. All right.

111
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:53,550
To have such a big support
group. Yeah, yeah, no,

112
00:07:53,551 --> 00:07:57,990
definitely. Yeah. That's
alright. That's alright dude.

113
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:05,130
Never have I ever cried
at the house. Three, two,

114
00:08:05,131 --> 00:08:05,964
one.

115
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:11,870
We've all cried from joy
from a lot of laughing.

116
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:16,660
A lot of, Oh, a lot of laughing.
A lot of emotions. That too loud,

117
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:20,070
heavy emotions, man. We're
emotional people. Yeah.

118
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,360
I feel like this like period of my life
has really changed who I am as a person.

119
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:30,720
This is a very pivotal moment is to 10.
Yeah,

120
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,450
I'm definitely gonna if we ever,
you know,

121
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:36,560
I'm pretty sure we'll go our
separate ways, but uh, you know,

122
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,040
really fun memory.
Yeah.

123
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:41,893
Yeah man.

124
