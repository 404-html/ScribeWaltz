1
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:14,860
So I started ballet when I was 10.
Dance basically saved me.

2
00:00:14,861 --> 00:00:18,700
It's a very constant thing in my life.
Did not come from a fortunate background,

3
00:00:18,701 --> 00:00:20,170
single parent.
You know,

4
00:00:20,171 --> 00:00:24,250
we had bouts of homelessness
in our lives and ballet for me,

5
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,130
made me feel like I could
overcome anything in my life.

6
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:34,680
I'm too, yeah, I'm a professional
ballerina and actress.

7
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:45,790
My name is Kay flow and
I like to freestyle.

8
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:51,490
I didn't really take any studio classes
or do any of the normal things for dance.

9
00:00:51,491 --> 00:00:52,930
I've made my own path.

10
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:57,990
And then two years ago I made it happen
and I moved to La from Missouri and then

11
00:00:58,331 --> 00:01:02,500
I got into a motorcycle accident last
year around this time and I couldn't walk

12
00:01:02,501 --> 00:01:06,590
and I almost had to give up
my dance. So dancing, uh,

13
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,260
since I've been through so much with it,

14
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:12,400
it means more than anything and I'm never
giving up no matter if my legs get cut

15
00:01:12,401 --> 00:01:13,270
off.
Okay.

16
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:15,373
Yeah.

17
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:32,440
Well, hello. Hey, are you a dancer? Yeah.

18
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:36,960
That's awesome. It's nice to meet you.
My name is Kaitlin Kaisa and sue. Yeah,

19
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:41,940
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Like what's
it to? Yeah. It's like, ah. Yeah.

20
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:46,660
You Do Probably Ballet, Huh? Yes, they
do. What did he do? I street dance.

21
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:51,480
Oh Wow. Actually had a friend who
taught me a little bit about Lais. Oh,

22
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:55,880
I can do a little bit,
look at you live your life.

23
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:00,140
My first impression was he seemed
pretty cool. I was like, okay,

24
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:04,110
brought in like a motorcycle helmet
and he had his glasses on. I was like,

25
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,800
are you a dancer? Like are you a
painter? Are you a rapper? I didn't know.

26
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:08,310
All right.

27
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:12,420
You want me to like stretch
and warm up? Yeah, I see.

28
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,530
I stretch pretty good. Just the way
she was standing, holding herself.

29
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,620
I could tell this is what she
does and she's very passionate.

30
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:22,320
Just by her standing there who I
already knew that we were going to make

31
00:02:22,321 --> 00:02:23,154
something beautiful.

32
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,280
Maybe one of us can be on the ground
and one of us can be hovering above the

33
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:32,750
other person or something like that.
Like let's say I would rather be up.

34
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:37,540
Okay. Let's say, let's see.
Combination of everything.

35
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:40,930
I'm coming somewhere. I don't know
the person about to collaborate with.

36
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,900
I don't even know what I'm not to do,
so it's always the anxiousness.

37
00:02:43,901 --> 00:02:47,320
I was feeling like,
what is going do you want to go up?

38
00:02:47,321 --> 00:02:50,470
Maybe I'm also extremely shy.

39
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:52,990
I get really nervous in my head.
I was like a whole,

40
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:55,390
I'm not awkward because I'm usually
really awkward, so it was like,

41
00:02:55,391 --> 00:03:00,070
I hope this goes really well. I wonder
if I can do a split turn. So I got,

42
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,340
I was just confused whenever I was doing
my freestyle or what the cue was for

43
00:03:03,341 --> 00:03:07,690
the screen counting. Do you count or no?
I usually don't. Oh, okay. Well then,

44
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:11,200
but you can hear me. He talks a basis
goes right. Yes, let's do it that way.

45
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,130
Probably my biggest Kryptonite has just
stayed on the account with the feeling

46
00:03:15,131 --> 00:03:17,380
of the music.
It's very hard if that helps.

47
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,840
All my big movements are
starting with a base.

48
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,070
What are some of the challenges
that you guys are coming up?

49
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,930
Will China mailed trying to,

50
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:29,910
trying to nail the ballet with it
with street and there was a couple of

51
00:03:29,911 --> 00:03:31,540
positions where I was like,
oh we can do this.

52
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:34,360
And then we'd like sit there and
be like, wait, we can't really,

53
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:39,650
I wonder if I can just do the same.
I don't know what those are called.

54
00:03:39,651 --> 00:03:41,740
The ballet flat.
Whenever you do the

55
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,450
like a two page I'd pay.
Are you going to do it too?

56
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:47,150
No, I was saying I can do the
street version of WHATSAPP.

57
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:51,890
It's just like a process to figure out
what the best option is of what we are

58
00:03:51,891 --> 00:03:55,610
both capable of and there's so many
options that that can be overwhelming a

59
00:03:55,611 --> 00:03:57,960
little bit.
But man we,

60
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,940
we fought through it and we came together
and came up with some really cool

61
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:05,240
concepts to this guy.

62
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:09,190
Like wave around you. It, yeah.

63
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:14,060
The challenge is is that we
made it really challenging.

64
00:04:14,061 --> 00:04:18,020
Like I think that like we both got excited
about each other's willingness to try

65
00:04:18,021 --> 00:04:23,021
new things that like once we found like
that open door we pull just like ran

66
00:04:23,151 --> 00:04:27,400
through it. So like, you know, there's
like interesting lifts in turns and,

67
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:30,430
and cutting.
I don't do like,

68
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:34,640
it's really cool that like we were able
to take both the things that scared us

69
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:38,750
and put it together and I'm pretty happy
with what we've been able to create.

70
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,280
Wasn't really easy,

71
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:44,760
but it almost felt like it
was meant to happen. Okay.

72
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,810
This is already a so cool.
Wow.

73
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:03,663
Hi.

74
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,033
Wow,

75
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:38,210
man.
He was a beautiful process.

76
00:06:38,211 --> 00:06:42,620
Like to go into unknown territory and just
hit it and get it done in a few hours.

77
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:45,680
I love being challenged and this is like
one of the most challenging things I've

78
00:06:45,681 --> 00:06:46,514
done in awhile.

79
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:50,450
These speaks in the language of like
street dancer and in this instance,

80
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:54,980
and speak in a language of Ballerina. So
how do we use our different backgrounds?

81
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:59,780
It speak to each other in a collaborative
manner to meet this like common ground,

82
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,060
which is cool.
I think we've found it.

83
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:15,520
Okay.
