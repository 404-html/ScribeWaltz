1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,870
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yo, Yo,

2
00:00:04,871 --> 00:00:05,980
what's good?
Yo

3
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:11,973
brief.

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,980
Hey,
hey

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,690
dancing or Brandon like popular songs.
This are fun. And I was like, hey.

6
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,570
And actually it looks good
and it looks Kinda cool.

7
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:29,210
So I just kept doing that
and then it started blowing
up and I just went with it.

8
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,260
It's like,
why not?

9
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:35,030
Like if you're 1415 and you're just
starting to get a lot of followers on

10
00:00:35,031 --> 00:00:37,030
Instagram as not something you just said.

11
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:37,913
No worries.

12
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:48,620
My name is Russell,
but people know me as backpack kid.

13
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:52,730
I'm 16 years old and I
am a content creator.

14
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,650
So I'm from Atlanta,

15
00:01:02,651 --> 00:01:07,651
Georgia and I'm really just
a normal teenage kid and I
just started doing videos

16
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:09,970
on the Internet and these blew up.

17
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,410
You ain't on the list.
Got To do better.

18
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:26,540
What did they think? They thought
I was just doing me having fun.

19
00:01:26,541 --> 00:01:30,200
So they just went along with it.
They let me travel with a manager.

20
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:32,450
Not a lot of parents would do that.

21
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,253
Okay.

22
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:37,523
How many?

23
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:42,420
I would say maybe two.
Almost three.

24
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:47,880
So a lot has happened in the past
two to three years. Do you invent?

25
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,493
Yes.

26
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:56,810
Most celebrities that you can think
of have probably done the dance before

27
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:58,930
and then I went on

28
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,600
SNL with Katy Perry and that's when it
really, really, really popped off. Wait,

29
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,180
you said what?
I can do that

30
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,860
now before noon on a Monday.

31
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:14,430
Okay. Okay. Okay,

32
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:20,330
and what are you about to post a
me philosophy with bronze burner.

33
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:25,770
Yeah. I'll tell you why.
Heavyweight champion. Yeah. Nice.

34
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:41,610
All right.
Yes.

35
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:48,183
Cool.

36
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:53,140
And then also a part right here and
then like a design on this side.

37
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:00,490
It's fun traveling and meeting New People.
I like attention.

38
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,550
Yeah, I get it. I get a lot of that now.

39
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:11,360
Bella Bella backpack kit. Here
you are. No one's going on. Yeah,

40
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:14,530
the people around me have definitely
changed. They all want to be my friend now

41
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:20,950
or is that weird? It's not my
problem. It's their problem,

42
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:23,980
not mine. There's still a
lot of hair on my forehead.

43
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,100
He was really good. This
one, it was really good.

44
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:36,980
Can we take the Chili off regularly?

45
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,780
I'll take a root beer float.

46
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,790
You feel like you've changed
through this process? Not really.

47
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:50,380
I still act the same way. How, how I
usually like act before all this happened,

48
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,480
we're all star just posted me
teaching Deontay wilder how to floss.

49
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:04,580
Like if the backpack gets fell off
at the most liked comment right now.

50
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:08,060
Coordination skills,
not on point. Same Old,

51
00:04:08,061 --> 00:04:11,690
same old check my story.
Oh my God, it's insane.

52
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:17,000
Hey people that just try to
advertise themselves on my page

53
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:21,860
overall.
Yes,

54
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:25,190
I do think social media is a good thing
because it's a way for people to keep

55
00:04:25,191 --> 00:04:29,210
social. Oh yeah, there's
definitely cyber bullying.

56
00:04:29,211 --> 00:04:32,840
So I read my comments all the
time and really a main one.

57
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,233
No care.

58
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,160
I run it back one more time.

59
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,870
We have the same to drip
on boat coming soon.

60
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:51,230
Yes. I'm dropping a project
this year. You African, uh,

61
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:53,570
hopefully pop off my music career.

62
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:59,560
I tried to have my own style.

63
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:04,490
Like you don't want to anybody else's
rob flow like any old school rappers.

64
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:10,310
Um, like I know of Tupac and Biggie.
I don't really listen to them though,

65
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:12,320
but I do respect that.
Like they are legends.

66
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,330
We are off to Steve.

67
00:05:17,331 --> 00:05:20,930
I label to see what's up with a single
that we're trying to drive with them.

68
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:27,550
So I remember in these meetings like when
we talked about the kid stuff that we

69
00:05:27,751 --> 00:05:30,330
talked about like four
or how about you do?

70
00:05:30,331 --> 00:05:33,210
I'm a talker and I'm the
face of the operation.

71
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:37,423
Hello.

72
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:48,923
Nice to meet you too.

73
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:54,270
In my opinion is not really
anything hard about it.

74
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:58,580
I guess just like hard work
and a few days of little sleep,

75
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:03,560
but that's just like work. You work a
lot though. Yeah, for a 16 year old,

76
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:06,770
but it's fun work.
Do you ever feel tired?

77
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,900
Feeling tired is boring?

78
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,990
I can just imagine doing a new
segment right here. Hey guys,

79
00:06:15,991 --> 00:06:20,991
my name is bag pack kit and welcome to
backpack kid news and weather and today's

80
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:26,640
recent stories, backpack is
dropped. Paid any fee this year.

81
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:32,820
Amazing
backdrop.

82
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:35,990
This is a nice view.

83
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,260
If you think of backpack kid,

84
00:06:39,261 --> 00:06:43,500
you think of a guy who created a floss
and does silly dances on his Instagram.

85
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,940
But I'm trying to get credibility as a
rapper because being a rapper it looks

86
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:51,660
like a lot of fun and I want to use that
opportunity to do good in the world.

87
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,820
Right.
There's a huge truck coming your way.

88
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,600
It's definitely a good experience
for a 16 year old then.

89
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:04,170
Not a lot of them experienced.

90
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:08,070
Like I know that most teenagers don't
go through the life that I go through,

91
00:07:08,071 --> 00:07:10,680
but I feel like that this
life that I live is normal.

92
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:16,650
So normal.
It's not normal.

93
00:07:16,651 --> 00:07:20,160
No, I wouldn't say it's normal.
It's normal to me. Yeah.

94
00:07:20,161 --> 00:07:23,040
But it's not normal to everybody else.
I'm in 11th grade,

95
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:27,000
so I have this year to finish and the
next year and then I'm done with high

96
00:07:27,001 --> 00:07:30,060
school and then I have my whole life
ahead of me to do whatever I need to do

97
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,850
actually.
And my friends might go to college,

98
00:07:32,851 --> 00:07:36,360
so I don't know what I'm
going to do about that. So

99
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:43,350
it's pretty unlikely at this at this
moment, because I already have a career.

100
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:48,620
I just gotta stay poppy to not need
to college. If I do need colleagues,

101
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:51,990
that means that like I've completely
fallen off and I'm not making any more

102
00:07:51,991 --> 00:07:52,824
money,

103
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:14,810
I would have died.

104
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:15,733
Right.

105
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:27,010
Okay. Yeah, that was Frederick
and Jayden and Jordan.

106
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,380
My friends and family,

107
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,950
they're definitely important for keeping
me sane through this whole process.

108
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,940
They just treated me the same way.
They said nothing in particular.

109
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:38,823
I liked that though.

110
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:48,470
I like attention. I was always the
class clown and the good ole elementary,

111
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,470
middle school days.

112
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:53,580
Love being loud and making a scene.

113
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,213
Yes.

114
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,470
Look both ways.

115
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,273
Yeah.

116
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:09,130
For the rest of the tonight I'm going
to see the premiere or wreck it.

117
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:13,900
Ralph breaks the Internet
in the background.

118
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,270
Yeah.
I'm trying to get into fanny packs.

119
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:23,840
So these are all the people
that have broken the Internet.

120
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,620
I've seen his name's Skye.

121
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:30,540
Me or I saw the video with,
um,

122
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:35,580
what's the name again? Jantek. Okay,

123
00:09:35,581 --> 00:09:37,500
so the video would Deontay wilder,

124
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:41,430
97 k views and then stories,

125
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,470
16 k views, 11 k views, 10 k you
think eight views and yeah, that's it.

126
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:52,020
Where do you get your sense of competence?
Um,

127
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,293
okay.

128
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:02,620
I guess this, this is how I
am, like my persona is myself,

129
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,600
so I got to do with the myself.

130
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:09,280
Don't pay attention when everybody
thinks of you and just do you.

131
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,260
That's the best way to do it.

132
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,533
No problem.

133
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:21,693
Oh,

134
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:23,710
do you feel like you've
achieved your dream?

135
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:29,260
And I have my whole life ahead
of me to achieve even Lord.

136
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,293
Okay.

137
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:33,550
Hey, I was good backpack. Katie here.

138
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,650
Big things that you believe Ravena
a in the life of a backpack kid,

139
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:39,170
but I got to catch his movie premiere.
Bye.

140
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,220
Yes. Is that okay? You show up.
Where do you want to go? Anywhere.

141
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,250
Do you get to price all
the time? Yeah. Sorry.

142
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,240
You're good. You're good. You want to go.
