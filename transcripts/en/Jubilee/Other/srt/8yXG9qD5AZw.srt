1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:03,360
You have an amazing smile.
I like how you smile with your whole face.

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:05,310
It makes me happy.

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,710
A viral New York Times article featured
36 questions that could supposedly make

4
00:00:14,711 --> 00:00:16,210
any two people falling in love.

5
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,380
We want it to see what would happen if
we ask these questions to two complete

6
00:00:20,381 --> 00:00:21,970
strangers on a blind date.

7
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,220
My name is Sonia. I'm from a city called
Sarnia outside of Toronto in Canada.

8
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,270
And I'm single.

9
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,740
I feel like my whole job is being in
front of cameras and I'm never nervous.

10
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:35,680
I'm a little nervous. I got a
little, I'm a little clammy.

11
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:38,620
I've never been on a blind date. So
this is, this is out of my element.

12
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:43,000
My name is James.
I am from Thailand and I'm single.

13
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:48,310
Have you ever been on a blind
date? I don't think so. No.

14
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:54,550
Yeah. No, I get that. Yeah,

15
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,260
it's like warm, but
it's not warm. It's not.

16
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:12,240
Hi. Hi. Hi. It's Tanya James. Gotcha.

17
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:17,320
Alright, so we're gonna have some
tea I guess. So. Cheers. Cheers.

18
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,930
That's going to I, you want to smell
myself? Yeah, it's really hot too.

19
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,450
We don't have napkins. You have questions,
so probably start so that this is not,

20
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:32,430
you want to go first? Sure.
Okay. Complete this sentence.

21
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:36,870
I wish I had someone with whom
I could share and ventures.

22
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:39,300
Hmm. I think it was the first
thing that came to my mind.

23
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:42,240
I think work is extremely important,
but I'm also,

24
00:01:42,241 --> 00:01:46,590
I feel very spontaneous where I'm like,
you know what? Today I'm going here.

25
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:48,940
I'm going to just like go to San
Diego for the day, or what the hell?

26
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:51,520
I got a copy of it. Yeah.
Being able to share it.

27
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:55,980
Ventures would be required
of someone. Yeah. Instead of
having to be like, no, no,

28
00:01:55,981 --> 00:02:00,150
we need to plan and do all that,
which I genuinely am and can be.

29
00:02:00,151 --> 00:02:03,180
It's good to have both. Yeah. Yeah. If
you're going like some were international,

30
00:02:03,181 --> 00:02:05,880
it's like, okay, let's
like look at some places.

31
00:02:05,881 --> 00:02:08,910
I think I'm also like very blessed
to have a schedule that allows me,

32
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:12,100
because I feel like a lot of people
don't getting it soon. There you go.

33
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,660
I'm believing. Yeah. Believing it more
regular job to become more flexible,

34
00:02:15,661 --> 00:02:17,250
so that's nice. That'll be good. Yeah.

35
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,480
When did you last sing to
yourself or to someone else?

36
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:25,890
I always sing to warm up my voice.
I have an audition or something.

37
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,430
Do you have a good singing voice or um,
my saint choir in high school.

38
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,350
So what would you say?

39
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:38,250
Um, no pressure. There's no
cameras. There was nobody.

40
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:42,440
No, of course not. For example,
a good song. Uh, do you know,

41
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:46,470
go steal cars for Rose Rose?
It's a little high for me.

42
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,910
I think I see a shiny,
Eh,

43
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:54,980
used to be a green towel.
No, no, no. I'm see he,

44
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,150
you remain alone.

45
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:00,780
The dots me

46
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:08,440
this, Huh? For something.
So then it was beautiful.

47
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:12,070
Thank you. So I had kind of a throwback
day and the other day I was like,

48
00:03:12,071 --> 00:03:16,030
I need something to go on
when I'm cleaning. And then
I got caught on incubus.

49
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:18,010
Okay. I got stuck on like
the morning view albums.

50
00:03:18,011 --> 00:03:22,330
I was like blaring some incubus cleaning
my room like a couple of days ago.

51
00:03:22,331 --> 00:03:27,310
So that was probably last time I sang.
Aw. What is your most treasured memory?

52
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,710
I have too many man. Aw,
that's a good feeling though

53
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:37,410
because of how unique my school was
and the people I was waiting, you know,

54
00:03:37,411 --> 00:03:39,330
international school,
everyone's from everywhere.

55
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:42,900
There was some weird thing too about my
grade where we kind of just overstepped

56
00:03:42,901 --> 00:03:47,460
any of these like I guess
social boundaries and like
everyone just got super

57
00:03:47,461 --> 00:03:50,040
close. Are you still friends
with a lot of them? Yeah.

58
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:54,240
Actually the reason I play pub g so much
is because most of my friends are my

59
00:03:54,241 --> 00:03:57,300
old school friends and they're
now they're in Thailand. Yeah.

60
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:59,070
So you know there's Latin see which sucks.

61
00:03:59,071 --> 00:04:02,470
But like they're the ones that got me
on it and I was like I don't want to do

62
00:04:02,471 --> 00:04:04,920
this as then suddenly we'd been
playing for like four months straight.

63
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,060
Isn't it crazy how gaming
can be such a bridge? Yeah.

64
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,080
And just like keep your conduct.

65
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:09,560
Yeah.

66
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,340
Cause people I haven't talked to in
years that just hopped on this train and

67
00:04:13,341 --> 00:04:15,420
suddenly we were like gaming
on the weekends together.

68
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:16,340
There was somebody that I,

69
00:04:16,341 --> 00:04:21,250
I played league of legends with for
like four years and I never met them.

70
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,950
And then randomly at an event in La,

71
00:04:23,951 --> 00:04:28,120
this person comes up to me and he's like
Sanja Coz we knew what each other look

72
00:04:28,121 --> 00:04:32,830
like from social media and we just so
happen to run into each other after five

73
00:04:32,831 --> 00:04:35,710
years of playing league of legends
together just randomly on the street.

74
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,350
It's crazy. I, it just like
connects people like that.

75
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:43,540
I feel like I kind of feel the same
way. I feel like I have a lot. One more,

76
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:46,860
I feel like I was like particularly
proud of myself was last summer I was

77
00:04:46,861 --> 00:04:49,540
hosting like a,
like a conference for a three.

78
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,870
There was a whole bunch of things kind
of leading up to it where I was told I

79
00:04:52,871 --> 00:04:55,630
was going to have a prompt her and
I didn't. So I had nothing prepared,

80
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,220
didn't have a teleprompter.

81
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,690
And it was like a minute before we were
alive and it was like tens of millions

82
00:05:01,691 --> 00:05:05,050
of people. Like they're like, all
right, 30 seconds. And I blanked. Oh.

83
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:09,460
And I had no idea. I didn't even
know what event I was at anymore.

84
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:13,630
I'm like, I gotta just say
words. And they're like, all
right, 10 seconds. I'm like,

85
00:05:13,631 --> 00:05:18,130
I don't even know my name. I
trust, I just spewed stuff out.

86
00:05:18,131 --> 00:05:21,780
And for the rest of the two hour show
I just like nailed it. I nailed it. Oh,

87
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:25,000
it was so proud of myself
because I'm like, I had nothing.

88
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,950
I had nothing prepared and I
didn't know how to do anything.

89
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:30,550
And after I did that, I was like, I'm
like, I feel like I can do anything now.

90
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:35,140
It's like the years of practice, like led
up to that in the worst circumstances.

91
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,420
It's like, all right. And
then it just worked out.

92
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,820
So, hey, that's awesome. That was rough.

93
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,720
What your most terrible memory?

94
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,510
Oh Man.
On the flip coin of what I just said,

95
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,960
I think I also have a lot
of terrible memory. Yes.

96
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:52,540
At one point I was living back with my
mom and things weren't really working out,

97
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:57,170
but she wasn't very communicative of
like why it wasn't working out in why she

98
00:05:57,171 --> 00:06:02,120
was frustrated and why things were bad.
And she told,

99
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,990
um, the children's aid society too,
that she didn't want me anymore.

100
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:10,100
And instead of like surrendering me,
she left the house,

101
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:13,760
she didn't tell me where she was going
and then she had the children's aid

102
00:06:13,761 --> 00:06:18,670
society and the police and just show
up and just randomly take me back into

103
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,910
foster care after,
you know,

104
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:22,590
I had been there for a couple
of years and then I finally,

105
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:25,730
it was free and I was with my mom. It was
just randomly, I was just any other day.

106
00:06:25,731 --> 00:06:27,230
It was like a Saturday.
I was just at home.

107
00:06:27,231 --> 00:06:31,400
I was like on MSN or like something and
I just heard a knock at the door and

108
00:06:31,401 --> 00:06:34,100
then my whole life was just
like shit flipped upside down,

109
00:06:34,101 --> 00:06:37,400
like in a blink of an eye and it
was just back in foster care again.

110
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:41,540
It just like re dug up all of those like
shitty emotions and everything that I

111
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:45,020
sort of pushed this side cause I'm like,
oh, I'm free now. But then it's like, no,

112
00:06:45,021 --> 00:06:48,770
I'm not. Yeah, it's not. How Fun.

113
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:50,983
What about you?

114
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,550
Um,
it was um,

115
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:59,900
a drunken Halloween night and someone
I had been kind of involved with,

116
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:05,180
she had gotten punched my bouncer.

117
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:11,130
Oh yeah, she got really angry too, cause
she knew the owner and she was like, no,

118
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:15,930
I want to go back in and talk to him. Ask
Him why this happened. Long story short,

119
00:07:15,931 --> 00:07:20,580
we ended up going back in and I was
trying to stop her without like physically

120
00:07:20,581 --> 00:07:22,680
stopping her and she
wasn't having any of that

121
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,020
and it basically ended up like
us getting jumped by like,

122
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:30,330
I don't know what the total
number of bouncers was,

123
00:07:30,331 --> 00:07:34,800
but it was definitely like five to seven
ish. In that moment I was just like,

124
00:07:34,801 --> 00:07:37,830
oh my God, am I going to die?
Is she going to die? Or we just,

125
00:07:37,831 --> 00:07:40,110
what is it going to happen? I don't
know. So it was just a really,

126
00:07:40,111 --> 00:07:41,570
really bad situation

127
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:44,790
I think. Any, any event that you like
a question, if you're going to look,

128
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:48,890
yeah, it's usually not one
that's, yeah, I'm sorry. Yeah,

129
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,490
I can't speak for her, but there's
no permanent emotional damage for me.

130
00:07:52,491 --> 00:07:55,820
So I'm to,
and I've learned from that situation.

131
00:07:55,821 --> 00:07:58,130
So when did you last cry?

132
00:07:58,131 --> 00:08:02,300
In front of another person or by herself?
There's two questions I guess.

133
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,990
I'm a very emotional person.

134
00:08:04,991 --> 00:08:09,991
I feel like two days ago I've been having
like a really emotional week and I'm

135
00:08:10,451 --> 00:08:11,830
not very close with my dad anymore.

136
00:08:11,831 --> 00:08:15,220
He's still in Canada and he'll
text me like once a month,

137
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,570
once like maybe twice a month.

138
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:19,120
And I've been feeling really down about
stuff that I've been doing and stuff

139
00:08:19,121 --> 00:08:20,320
that I've been working on projects.

140
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:25,480
And he said like he said something along
the lines of when you were younger I

141
00:08:25,481 --> 00:08:29,020
always saw you as an artist and I'm
proud of where you are or something like

142
00:08:29,021 --> 00:08:32,350
that. And I was like, cause it was just
perfect. It was like perfect timing.

143
00:08:32,351 --> 00:08:36,490
I was feeling shitty and it was just
like exactly what I needed to hear and it

144
00:08:36,491 --> 00:08:38,800
like really hit me.
What about you?

145
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:44,810
Last time I cry by myself was yesterday
cause I saw some video on reddit about

146
00:08:45,151 --> 00:08:49,860
two little girls who were like facetime
besties and their parents were besties

147
00:08:49,861 --> 00:08:52,710
and then they only met by facetime because
they live far away from each other.

148
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:56,140
But it was like the first
time they met in. Yeah,

149
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,240
I think like, yeah, it was so cute.
Okay, well now that I think about it,

150
00:09:00,241 --> 00:09:03,170
there was a really cute pit bull video.
I saw it yesterday.

151
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:07,110
It was like a pit bull. How goofy I isn't
this family just like loved it so much.

152
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:10,490
I hate it when cute stuff makes me cry.
It's like I'm so holy,

153
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,220
it's so wholesome but then like I'm
crawling over and it's like good.

154
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:18,810
It's happy to alternate sharing something
you consider a positive characteristic

155
00:09:18,811 --> 00:09:23,420
of your partner. Share a total
of three items. Oh, okay.
Alternate between the, okay.

156
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:26,470
There's like alternate between positive
and negative. Yeah. Tell me some negative.

157
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:31,490
Yeah. Geez. Okay. Um,
right because it's me for,

158
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,860
do you have a great sense of humor?
Thanks. I like your sense of humor. Yeah.

159
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,780
You have an amazing smile.

160
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:41,060
I like how you smile with your
whole face and it makes me happy.

161
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,950
Smile with like your like your eyes,
your everything.

162
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,370
Everything is engaged in your
smile. Thank you. I like it.

163
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:52,290
I like that you're humble but you
also know what your strengths are.

164
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:54,323
Thanks.

165
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,180
I wanted to say something about your hair.
We're too,

166
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,800
cause I really were reversed. We
have a similar sense of humor. Yeah.

167
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,490
Besides the humor thing, like I just
get a feeling that you've, you know,

168
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,200
even through like acting
classes and stuff like that,

169
00:10:04,201 --> 00:10:06,390
you've done a lot of like self
discovery and I feel like you're,

170
00:10:06,391 --> 00:10:09,360
you're pretty aware of who you are,
which is cool.

171
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,240
Your hair looks like it belongs
in a shampoo commercial.

172
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:18,360
Really? Yeah. I'll tell you it's actually
pretty dry but I'll take it. I liked the,

173
00:10:18,361 --> 00:10:22,290
I liked that you can be vulnerable. I feel
like a lot of people aren't, you know,

174
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:25,950
super open and they kind of, you know,
push things aside or they like don't,

175
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:28,260
aren't as communicative about things.

176
00:10:28,261 --> 00:10:30,630
But I feel like you seem
like you can be vulnerable.

177
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:35,870
I mean you're here having tea with me in
front of cameras so I appreciate that.

178
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,450
Thank you. This is the last one. Would
you go on a second day with your partner?

179
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:44,243
Aw

180
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,490
Yeah.
That took a while though.

181
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:53,610
I was gauging your reaction cause I was
like listen to you can, you can say no.

182
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:58,410
Oh I'm told it will be offensive to
answer first. Oh okay. Yeah. I don't know.

183
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:03,450
Yeah, I think it would. Yeah, no,
definitely. Would you as well? Uh,

184
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:06,480
I might have to,
I don't know about that one.

185
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:11,130
Everything was so great but then
she did fingers and I'm out.

186
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,280
Want me to top you up? Yeah,
final for final cheers.

187
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:16,933
Okay,

188
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:20,060
well cheers to that being catfished.
Yes,

189
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:25,740
just take it like a shot.
I don't know why Jay was like a habit.

190
00:11:25,741 --> 00:11:30,490
I was just like how it that is telling
me and then you'll see it's okay.

191
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,320
That's great.

192
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,610
