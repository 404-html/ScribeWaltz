1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,660
You have a beautiful smile. Thank
you. I have, when you smile,

2
00:00:03,661 --> 00:00:04,830
I think it's really authentic.

3
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:05,803
Okay.

4
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:14,340
A viral New York Times article featured
36 questions that could supposedly make

5
00:00:14,341 --> 00:00:15,840
any two people falling in love.

6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,010
We wanted to see what would happen if
we asked these questions to two complete

7
00:00:20,011 --> 00:00:21,600
strangers on a blind date.

8
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,360
My name is Charisse Gibbons and I'm
currently single. What do you look for?

9
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:32,070
Somebody who's a good listener,
someone who's really kind.

10
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:37,190
I also look for someone who I think can
have deep conversations and can take

11
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:43,290
things seriously but also can have
fun. No, that's kind of opposite,

12
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,630
but I liked that in someone.
My name is Paula Chung and I'm single,

13
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,250
very single. I feel kind of
nervous, kind of anxious,

14
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,810
kind of excited and I dunno,
uh, I don't know what to expect,

15
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:58,560
who do meet,

16
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,640
but I think it's going to be a good
time to just get to know a new person.

17
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,300
Have you ever been at a place?
I've never been on a blind date before.

18
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:12,150
It's my first time.
You like most nervous about?

19
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,160
Maybe the awkwardness that
there'll be in the beginning,

20
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,340
but I feel like once we get talking
then I think that'll go away.

21
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:27,260
Oh, hi. Nice to meet you.

22
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:31,500
I see you, Paulo and Charisse. Hi Karen.
Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you.

23
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,650
How are you from La area
originally? I'm from Brazil. Oh,

24
00:01:37,651 --> 00:01:40,900
browsing LADOT but as a
little boy to the bank.

25
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:45,180
How do you know Portuguese? I let
every two months. Really? Yeah,

26
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:48,420
but that's pretty much the extent of
what I know. Okay. What about you?

27
00:01:48,421 --> 00:01:52,100
Are you from la? I'm from
Orange County. All right. Um,

28
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,750
moved from the east coast with my
family when I was really young.

29
00:01:54,751 --> 00:01:58,110
So it's pretty much the majority
of what I know. Right. All right.

30
00:01:58,111 --> 00:02:02,640
Do you want some more tea before we begin?
I would love some. All right, cool. Yes,

31
00:02:02,641 --> 00:02:07,620
please. All right. All right.
Do you want to go first? Okay.

32
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:13,550
So do you have a secret
hunch about how you will die?

33
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,070
I know how I want to die,

34
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,700
like in a way where people feel
like that was pretty legendary.

35
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:24,240
Know that that's a way to go.
I don't know. I don't know.

36
00:02:24,241 --> 00:02:28,730
Like saving someone's life really
dramatic. Yeah. Korean dramas. Yes.

37
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,200
That's such a good answer.
How about you?

38
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:35,880
I'm afraid to say it because I don't want
to curse myself. You know what I mean?

39
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,753
No,
don't worry.

40
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:42,290
I've always been afraid that I would die
from some sort of disease or really bad

41
00:02:42,691 --> 00:02:46,530
car accident. Yeah. Okay.
Hopefully it will be quick.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was like,

42
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,740
oh shoot, I'm really gonna die in a car
accident and then, and then that's it.

43
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:52,740
No time to freak out. Yeah. You
can't even freak out. It's so quick.

44
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:56,730
Let's just leave that to God.
Can I see more to please? Yes.

45
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,493
Stressed.

46
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:04,690
When did you last sing to
yourself or to someone else?

47
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:09,670
Like 15 minutes ago in
the car. The car? Yeah.

48
00:03:09,671 --> 00:03:12,280
I was listening to some Whitney Houston.
What about you?

49
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,860
Last time I sang to myself,

50
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,300
maybe in the shower sometimes will,

51
00:03:18,301 --> 00:03:21,010
I'll be driving and my sister's next
to me and then when I started seeing,

52
00:03:21,011 --> 00:03:23,770
she's like, can you stop?
You're embarrassing me. Oh,

53
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,490
does that mean that you can show
me a little dance bay right now?

54
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,430
I think would just be like
a sh a shoulder, you know,

55
00:03:30,431 --> 00:03:32,860
like just like a little shimmy.
Yeah. Just shoot me. Right? Yeah.

56
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,770
You'll be like right next to
another car. I'll be like, hey look,

57
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,220
I think that will be enough.

58
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:43,270
For what in your life do
you feel most grateful?

59
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,720
I think most grateful for my family.

60
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:51,160
Very grateful for my parents,
my siblings too.

61
00:03:51,161 --> 00:03:53,110
I think as a whole week,

62
00:03:53,111 --> 00:03:55,660
kind of like compliment each
other and complete each other.

63
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:00,040
How many siblings do you have? I'm the
oldest. Oh. And then I have a brother,

64
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,460
a sister, and then the little
brother, three boys and one girl.

65
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:07,840
She suffers a little bit, but that's
crazy. Minus three girls and one boy.

66
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,240
Weird who set up this blind date.

67
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:18,250
Pretty good casting in this blind date
every year for the past three years,

68
00:04:18,251 --> 00:04:23,170
me and my siblings, I've been doing
a new year's video. Um, just for fun.

69
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,510
That's awesome.
And then we post it on Instagram.

70
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,820
I see this.
Oh my goodness,

71
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:39,810
you guys do this every year.
We started like three years ago.

72
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:44,920
Now it's starting to become sort of like
a tradition, but yeah, that's, that's my,

73
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:47,470
that's me and my siblings. Yeah.
You so much for showing me that

74
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:53,260
name. Three things. You and your
partner appeared to having common.

75
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:59,800
Can do this one together.
Korean. I'm half Korean. Um,

76
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:05,020
we've both been to Brazil. You
mentioned your dad's a pastor. Okay.

77
00:05:05,021 --> 00:05:09,430
My Dad's a pastor to
stop it. Oh my. A. Okay.

78
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,840
You know Richard, cheers. Cheers.

79
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:19,120
Cheers to the PKS pks out there.
Next question. We're good on this.

80
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:24,900
If you can wake up tomorrow having
gained any one quality or ability,

81
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:28,720
what would it be?
Do you have one?

82
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:34,120
Fearlessness will just so I can see,
see how much of it holds them back.

83
00:05:34,121 --> 00:05:38,080
Maybe not much. Well, but that'd be
interesting. Can I have to rethink mine?

84
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:43,170
Maybe mom was too superficial. It's
like, whoa. You're listening to though.

85
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,400
Um,
I wish I could fly.

86
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:49,420
Shoo the feeling of being able to fly.
We'll be awesome.

87
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,590
Is there something that you've
dreamed of doing for a long time?

88
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:58,610
Why haven't you done it?
I think I haven't do I dream about it?

89
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,330
I guess it's a desire.
Um,

90
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,680
I've wanted to somehow be in the movie.

91
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:10,970
Even if I die on that scene or I just
come out, I'm like, hey, and it gets shot.

92
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,440
Maybe that's like a small dream, but
yeah, it's, it's something that like, oh,

93
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:17,690
I think it would be interesting.
You know, similar to yours.

94
00:06:17,691 --> 00:06:21,530
I think mine was doing
something in film or TV.

95
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,040
I've always been afraid to do it
because it felt very vulnerable. Yeah.

96
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:29,210
We have like one life. Yeah,
that much time. Exactly.

97
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,590
It's got to take the chances and do it.

98
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:38,520
What is your most terrible memory?
I got arrested at a checkpoint.

99
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:42,630
I was 19. I remember sitting
in handcuffs on the curb,

100
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:47,580
like tearing up and just thinking,

101
00:06:47,581 --> 00:06:51,900
how am I going to tell my parents
what's going to happen next?

102
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:56,350
Big Life lesson for me.
Yeah. And that PK, PK.

103
00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:00,870
Okay. I know you all right.

104
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,950
I'm terrible memory.
The one I can think of right now.

105
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:09,540
I was on set and I was kind of
like learning everything I did,

106
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,350
like they didn't work out. So
like, Hey, can you shoot this?

107
00:07:13,351 --> 00:07:16,620
Then I would accidentally
step on something. Something
will fall. Oh, so like,

108
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:20,190
oh my goodness, like who
brought this guy's like, I
almost teared up. I was like,

109
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,140
oh my goodness,
this is so hard.

110
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:25,560
But then it turned into something really
positive later because I was like, wow.

111
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:30,180
But I'm so thankful. Despite being
super hard, um, I have this opportunity.

112
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:34,790
Alternate sharing something you consider
a positive characteristic of your

113
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:36,900
partner.
I'll start.

114
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:40,790
I really like your energy and openness.

115
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,430
I think that's a great
characteristic to have.

116
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:47,000
Just someone who's a good
conversationalist and easy to talk to.

117
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:52,490
I love the fact that you talked
about like, I want to be fearless,

118
00:07:52,491 --> 00:07:56,510
but I feel like you already are.
Like you do a lot of things.

119
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:59,850
You don't want to regret it and you
just do it. You're a family guy,

120
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:04,860
you really care about your family and
it's very evident that you guys are close.

121
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:09,890
I don't know how many times I talk to
people who are at least openly grateful

122
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,410
for their parents and for their siblings.
So that's cool.

123
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:17,430
You have a beautiful smile.
Thank you. When you smile,

124
00:08:17,431 --> 00:08:18,660
I think it's really authentic.

125
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:23,790
What do you go on a second
date with your partner?

126
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,800
Do we time this the answer or,
okay, go first. I'll go first.

127
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:34,630
I would. There's seems to be
other factors involved in,

128
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:37,580
in dating. Do you want to
get to know someone? Yeah.

129
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:42,420
Do you want to hear more about their
story in a safe setting and yeah,

130
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:46,130
I would totally do that. I would
totally ask you out on a second date.

131
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:50,870
I feel like, um, we really
connected. We had like what, an hour,

132
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,010
an hour and a half to talk right now,

133
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:55,920
but I know there's so much
more that you sure. Yeah.

134
00:08:55,921 --> 00:08:59,160
I don't know what's after
this, but I guess like, yeah,

135
00:08:59,161 --> 00:09:03,840
we could set up a time or something. I'm
still here. Yeah, sounds good to me. Cool.

136
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,160
Cool. I want to see another video.
Okay. Yeah. Oh, let me, let me,

137
00:09:08,161 --> 00:09:09,480
let me find it on the last year.

138
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,540
I feel like I've seen this.

139
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,770
I feel like I love your sister.

140
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,750
Yeah, my sister's pretty crazy. I
think you'll get along with my sister.

141
00:09:24,751 --> 00:09:26,970
She and he or she here?
No, she's in Brazil.

142
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:29,183
She's awesome.

143
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:33,680
Hey guys, it's Taylor and

episode of tea for two. Uh,

we wanted to ask you another
question for the comments below.

146

Complete this sentence. I wish I
had someone with whom I could share.

147
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:49,480
I wish I had someone whom I
can share this video with.

Hey guys, guys who I'm with, Charisse,
we did go on the second date.

153
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:14,140
Indeed we did. It was
horrible. What? Just kidding.

154
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:18,080
We'd be talking for hours. Nobody's
here anymore. So everybody's like gone.

155
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:21,670
But yeah, it was super fun. Yes.
Awesome. Great. Five silly shit.

156
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,090
Bye.
