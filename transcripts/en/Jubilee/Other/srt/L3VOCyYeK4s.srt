00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,390
password 8 charactersDo you feel like
it's good to be like forthright about

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,840
what you're looking for? Absolutely.
Why waste your time with this?

3
00:00:06,841 --> 00:00:10,260
Like well maybe like he'll
change or it'll work.

4
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:11,610
Yeah.

5
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,310
Cause if he's a Scorpio and
you don't want a Scorpio,

6
00:00:14,311 --> 00:00:18,660
it's like why waste your time get a
Libra like, oh my God. Libras are,

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,950
I mean at Capricorns are fine
too. Okay, wait. Oh, here we go.

8
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:27,690
Hey photo bomber.
No good

9
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,870
writing. You guys. This is
my makeup from yesterday.

10
00:00:34,871 --> 00:00:35,704
We'll just do it.

11
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,640
Okay, cool. Well how are you guys

12
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,313
Redo?

13
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:06,990
All right. Anyone who doesn't want to
go on a date with Angie? Three two, one.

14
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,140
Wait, but I can't text
this fast. So slow down.

15
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:21,850
Like if you're a Scorpio,
I'm not even into astrology either.

16
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:23,850
All I know is that they're really

17
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:24,823
mean.

18
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:40,720
Oh

19
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,553
sure.

20
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,120
I definitely do need a date.

21
00:01:48,121 --> 00:01:53,121
Somebody who's like down for Vegan
food once in a while all the time.

22
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,670
Mostly Vegan.
Possible.

23
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,960
I like everyone's Downey Vegan food.

24
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:12,850
Penny one's not down to eat
vegan food. Three, two, one.

25
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,213
Skirt.

26
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,480
Donuts are Vegan too.

27
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:24,261
I mean,

28
00:02:24,261 --> 00:02:29,261
I really do appreciate adventurous
sex just cause I'm an obviously an

29
00:02:29,451 --> 00:02:32,960
adventurous person.
If someone's down to have sex in the park,

30
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,630
I'm like all about it. Or, or
nine apart. Cause there's kids.

31
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:50,403
Hmm.

32
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:56,040
Do we have swipe on our phones? Is that
how we're doing? It's so fast. Yeah.

33
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,900
It's your thumbs. Okay. You can stay.

34
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,320
Okay.

35
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,640
Really? Everyone's down. I'm, I'm wait.

36
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:18,100
Thanks for your honesty.
Ooh.

37
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:22,463
Yeah.

38
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:26,360
You know, I really do love Brown
eyes. Like I'm going to start there.

39
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:31,430
We'll say brown hair, black hair. So
they have to have brown or black hair.

40
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:35,843
Oh,

41
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:42,443
okay.

42
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:48,803
Wow.

43
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:55,080
This counts.
That's something

44
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:58,640
I think so.

45
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:01,040
All right.

46
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,820
Are we on in here about Brown eyes
and Brown hair and black hair counts,

47
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,390
right? Oh yeah, sorry. Yeah,

48
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:11,230
and they both Brown eyes black and

49
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:18,020
I have one.
Okay.

50
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:20,940
Yeah,
I'd prefer somebody.

51
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:25,010
Ooh, it's not religious. Yeah.

52
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,790
No.

53
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:40,503
Okay.

54
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:09,640
I'm down for like, you know when
we're like senior citizens to get,

55
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:14,200
be like domestic partners. That's
the legal term. But other than that,

56
00:05:14,201 --> 00:05:18,280
no. No marriage, no kids. Honestly,

57
00:05:18,281 --> 00:05:21,200
no cats either. But, oh,

58
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:25,450
I do want a house with a backyard to
grow some strawberries. That's all.

59
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:32,973
Hmm.

60
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,920
Roll away.

61
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:21,200
Hey, yeah, those were all my questions.

62
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:24,340
That's that. Let's go have
sex on the beach now. Nothing.

63
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,660
I mean, that's what's really
weird. It was interesting.

64
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:38,290
We're in 2018 it feels like we're
definitely like going places.

65
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:42,980
I just think like, I know what I want
and if somebody knows that they want,

66
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:48,050
why not say it to manifest it?
You know,

67
00:06:48,051 --> 00:06:51,230
like people have said it straight
to my face before and like,

68
00:06:51,231 --> 00:06:56,150
that feels right. I don't know. Like
you're too young and it's like, okay,

69
00:06:56,151 --> 00:07:01,010
cool. I have no control over that. Or
like you smoke too much weed. It's like,

70
00:07:01,011 --> 00:07:04,070
well, I have control over that, but
fuck you. I'm not going to change. So

71
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,970
why waste time?
You know,

72
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:15,120
I do. Are we in exchange that?
Yeah, let's do that. Okay.

73
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,120
My neighbor,

74
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:22,730
I know, dude. No, I feel like now we're
going to run into each other there.

75
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,410
Um,
can I type it because I don't know.
