1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:06,190
Oh my God. Oh Wow, whoa.

2
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:13,650
So we were very nervous,

3
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,120
but at the same time we were excited to
come out of her comfort zone and just

4
00:00:18,121 --> 00:00:20,800
something different than what
we were shooting with. I Dunno,

5
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:24,960
I think I'm going to be a painter.
Other musicians,

6
00:00:24,961 --> 00:00:29,460
maybe dancers. Oh yeah.
Maybe it could be anything.

7
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:38,853
Youtube,

8
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,840
we come in and we usually
have music in front of us.

9
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:44,390
I really had no idea
anything can be thrown at us.

10
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,220
What if it's like a disco band?
I'd love that.

11
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:51,800
So we are all members of counties,
quartet string quartet based in La,

12
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:55,310
and we donate a portion of all our
proceeds to charitable organizations

13
00:00:55,311 --> 00:00:58,850
dedicated to animal. Hello,
my name is Maddie Martinez.

14
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:03,610
[inaudible] Maria cheese style.
My Dad,

15
00:01:03,611 --> 00:01:07,090
she's killed [inaudible] to edition
and it's very special to us.

16
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:22,093
Ah,

17
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:23,733
I'm ready.

18
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,313
Oh my God.

19
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,530
Other musicians.
That's great.

20
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,040
Well we could hear it walking in.

21
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:47,340
I was pretty psyched because I like
Mariachi music lights so joyous and you

22
00:01:47,341 --> 00:01:50,990
can't help but feel happy. And so
you're a Mariachi band. Yes, we,

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,990
what's the name of your group

24
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,760
that's Mariachi mean does make it kind of,

25
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:00,420
any other nation thinks that will
make it go. They think of all edge.

26
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:03,040
It's an a good patient of musicians.

27
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:07,930
I play specific instruments that are made
only for the sound of the Mariachi for

28
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:12,670
someone who was trained class play to try
to play other genres of music has been

29
00:02:12,671 --> 00:02:17,240
great in that regard. To explore other
donors and play like desperate cdot.

30
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,810
It's actually pretty fun.

31
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:24,600
And besides that we like to empower
women through our music and power people.

32
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,550
Do you know to keep going to
keep pushing to keep learning?

33
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,800
Vicki maybe we could take
like a classical tune.

34
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,400
Maybe we can add something with this.
I don't know.

35
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:36,440
I have a canon in d or
something. You can, okay.

36
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:39,890
We can take a piece that we know it's
a popular class when music piece,

37
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:42,710
but I'm thinking like we
start with something and I
mean like really passionate

38
00:02:42,711 --> 00:02:45,830
and serious.
And then after like one or two phrases,

39
00:02:45,831 --> 00:02:48,020
we'd kind of like more fit and
can second really fun thing.

40
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,320
When you play with a small group of
people, four people, three people,

41
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,600
you're all communicating,
you're all listening to each other.

42
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:56,720
There's still the basics of rhythm
and the chord structure is all there.

43
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:01,540
It's kind of scary at the
same time because you don't
know what kind of musical

44
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:02,380
level they are.

45
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:02,981
I was curious,

46
00:03:02,981 --> 00:03:06,850
could this fit themselves into this piece
without having music in front of them

47
00:03:06,851 --> 00:03:09,280
and they could immediately just learn
the chords and then they make it sound

48
00:03:09,281 --> 00:03:11,110
like a completely new version of it

49
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,350
guy's gonna come like jump in and try it.
Yeah.

50
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:19,190
Hours to it first.
What can you tone it is indeed.

51
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:30,860
So he started playing nicer feeling
thought, you know, the male would be okay.

52
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:44,270
Okay. So yeah. What do you guys
got? What do we got left Wednesday?

53
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,360
Wednesday is a fountain.

54
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,060
Ah,

55
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:58,380
classically trained musicians
tend to stick to the notes.

56
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:00,420
Mariachi players are amazing.

57
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:03,840
We did a lot of times it could
just learn it by here because debt,

58
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,510
the switch you can drop of a dime.

59
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:11,580
So block expressing her feelings and
release their emotions through music.

60
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,080
Oh,
okay.

61
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:19,080
I love that song. The guy, what's
the shallow? Reminds me of Madison.

62
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,210
Very goofy, very upbeat. Very funny.

63
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:42,840
I made up the lyrics and it was facey
cause they're like one minute and make,

64
00:04:42,841 --> 00:04:45,530
make up the lyrics.
I think they come at good.

65
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:51,070
I lost you and I thought I was
not going to find youth today.

66
00:04:51,141 --> 00:04:53,900
I found you all my love.

67
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,780
I very antsy to love you.

68
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:03,460
I believe that you are from Mars.
So it's kind of like,

69
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:07,880
whoa. Then I, I lost you and then I
found you and then, well yes you want to,

70
00:05:07,881 --> 00:05:10,400
you don't want it.
They're just

71
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:15,180
excited and happy and easy to work with
and good players will be linked to your

72
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:17,230
fingers.
Slow motion please like this.

73
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:18,993
Okay,

74
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,700
hold on.
I actually maybe stand up and show

75
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,570
high and mighty. Please
bold. He doesn't get word

76
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:33,480
to miss a rhino. Yeah,

77
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:43,920
yeah, yeah. Got It.

78
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,240
That makes it convenient though,
please.

79
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:54,893
I think should,

80
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,240
can I hear it one more time?

81
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:13,210
Is it lower penciling?
It has to be high pitched.

82
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:18,690
It depends on if the song has, you're
happy. You're gonna, you're gonna feel it.

83
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,330
Ooh. Woo. Thank you.

84
00:06:26,331 --> 00:06:30,950
Prying by your insight.
That's so special. Yeah. Yeah.

85
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,400
I'm really excited about what we did.
He was such a cool combination.

86
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,240
That was fun.
I'm looking forward to see.

87
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:42,500
It's fun and it's nice and it's super
classy with the beginning of this song and

88
00:06:42,501 --> 00:06:45,270
then getting to feel your style to it.

89
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:48,913
Oh,

90
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:52,330
I miss it.

91
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,350
We ready? Ready? Let's do this.

92
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,053
Yeah.

93
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:34,623
Okay.

94
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:50,563
Oh,

95
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,593
thank you.

96
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,710
Thank you. Good job.
Thank you guys. I know

97
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:14,600
that's it.
