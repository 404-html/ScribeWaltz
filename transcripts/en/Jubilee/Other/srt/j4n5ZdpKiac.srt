1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,080
He tried guilt tripping me into having
sex by sending me photos of him fake

2
00:00:04,081 --> 00:00:07,950
crying and implying that I owe him
sex for all that he does for me.

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,270
Guilt tripping for sex is like a really
threatening thing. You know? It's,

4
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:14,050
it's your body.
It's your choice.

5
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:25,493
Okay.

6
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:32,000
My name is Jennifer. I'm a mother.
I'm a pastor and I'm an author.

7
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:36,970
My name is Daniela and diamond Muslim,
Syrian American spoken word artists.

8
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,880
My name is in their brief core. I'm in
Punjabi sick woman. I'm an activist,

9
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,980
a writer and a sister.

10
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:49,980
My girlfriend's need for me to catalog
her life for Instagram constantly is

11
00:00:49,981 --> 00:00:53,420
slowly draining my soul.
I feel you.

12
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:57,790
I enjoy taking pictures
just as much as anyone else,

13
00:00:57,791 --> 00:01:01,810
but when I have to take 400 plus photos,
yes, you read that number, right?

14
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:06,460
It becomes difficult to help cope.
I've thought of taking caffeine. Oh,

15
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,450
Adderall weed or just running
into oncoming traffic. Oh my God.

16
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:14,970
Anyone have any healthier
alternatives as some of his, Scott,

17
00:01:14,971 --> 00:01:18,610
will this love hate relationship with
social media? I feel you because it's,

18
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:23,230
it becomes such a suffocating experience.
There's always that question of like,

19
00:01:23,231 --> 00:01:25,650
why am I taking this photo or video?
Exactly.

20
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:27,340
Maybe this is totally wrong assessment,

21
00:01:27,341 --> 00:01:30,490
but I feeling of like I want it to be
perfect, I want it to look perfect,

22
00:01:30,491 --> 00:01:31,700
I want it to be, you know. Right.

23
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:35,410
And there's probably some deeper stuff
in there that needs to be healed and

24
00:01:35,411 --> 00:01:39,190
dealt with and my advice would be
put healthy boundaries and just say,

25
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:43,120
here's the deal. Hey, we're going to
spend 15 minutes, 20 minutes, whatever.

26
00:01:43,121 --> 00:01:45,760
Set your boundary of like getting
you your picture that you want.

27
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:46,880
But after that we're not going to,

28
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,300
we're going to actually put our phones
away and just engage and enjoy each other.

29
00:01:49,301 --> 00:01:52,320
That's what I need. Right. So you get what
you need but I need to get what I need.

30
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:55,620
Yeah. Maybe he can be the one
to kind of address like what's,

31
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:59,280
what is the cause behind this
need for the increased photos?

32
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:05,160
My boyfriend and I are both virgins here
recently started begging for sex and

33
00:02:05,161 --> 00:02:06,080
when I wouldn't give in,

34
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:10,170
he tried guilt tripping me into having
sex by sending me photos of him fake

35
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:14,040
crying and implying that I owe him
sex for all that he does for me.

36
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:19,680
He later apologized for acting
that way. How do I seed? For me,

37
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:21,450
if I was in that situation,
I'd, I'd be like, okay,

38
00:02:21,451 --> 00:02:24,990
I really need you to honor this
boundary, right. Honor this thing.

39
00:02:24,991 --> 00:02:25,860
And if you can't,

40
00:02:25,861 --> 00:02:29,490
like I don't have to put a little bit
of distance because that would make me a

41
00:02:29,491 --> 00:02:33,720
little bit concerned of if he,
if he's not willing to honor this area,

42
00:02:33,721 --> 00:02:37,080
that's important to me. It's going
to be hard to trust in other areas.

43
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,920
As a survivor of domestic violence,

44
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:43,950
I can relate to a certain extent because
emotional manipulation is a big part

45
00:02:44,141 --> 00:02:48,760
that often goes unseen. Yeah. Um,
and so she mentioned guilt tripping.

46
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:52,030
That is an emotional abuse
even though he apologize.

47
00:02:52,031 --> 00:02:54,760
I would suggest kind of
maybe checking patterns.

48
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:57,100
Has this happened before and
in other areas, like you said,

49
00:02:57,101 --> 00:03:02,101
it breaks trust and if that it just
escalates into something worse and guilt

50
00:03:03,521 --> 00:03:07,430
tripping for a sex is like a really
threatening thing. You know, it's,

51
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:11,560
it's your body, it's your choice. When
should you have sex for the first time?

52
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:17,170
I've realized that you need to be
absolutely comfortable with the person.

53
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:19,510
You need to make sure that
they will respect you.

54
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:23,650
You need to make sure that they know
who you are, what your boundaries are.

55
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:27,370
Absolutely.
I think sometimes one side,

56
00:03:27,371 --> 00:03:31,210
often over romanticizes how committed
they are to that relationship and you

57
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,044
think you're ready,

58
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,780
but you have to dig deep and to know
what you're feeling and and just an

59
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,380
understanding that
you're on the same page.

60
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:42,370
When my husband I chose to do was to
not fully give ourselves until we were

61
00:03:42,371 --> 00:03:44,860
fully committed to each
other and got married.

62
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:48,490
I'm grateful that we chose that path
because in their safety in that knowing

63
00:03:48,491 --> 00:03:51,720
that you're giving yourself to somebody
who's going to forever be with you and

64
00:03:51,721 --> 00:03:52,570
be by your side.

65
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:57,850
My fiance is leaving me for another
woman whom he has had an emotional affair

66
00:03:57,851 --> 00:03:58,900
with for a month.

67
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:02,890
I don't know how I can ever trust a man
again or even find someone with the same

68
00:04:02,891 --> 00:04:07,750
priorities as me. I'm so devastated
and don't know what to do with myself.

69
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:13,810
That's really hard. That's
heavy. You like process that

70
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:20,640
when we're in pain and grief we don't
always think clearly or make good

71
00:04:21,101 --> 00:04:22,990
decisions, you know? So
being mindful of that,

72
00:04:22,991 --> 00:04:27,250
don't make any rash decisions
in that time and that place. Um,

73
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,350
there are good people out there.

74
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:34,180
I was in my early twenties when
this actually happened and you know,

75
00:04:34,181 --> 00:04:37,000
like all pain, all
breakups. This one was very,

76
00:04:37,001 --> 00:04:40,000
very painful and my personality
very much is, you know,

77
00:04:40,001 --> 00:04:44,800
if something huge happens to me, something
devastating happens, I will collapse.

78
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,490
And so don't put yourself through
that, talk about it, write about it.

79
00:04:48,491 --> 00:04:51,340
If that's what helps you,
it just let it out of your system.

80
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,030
Like my friends have said, I know
it's hard. I've been through as well.

81
00:04:55,031 --> 00:04:57,370
I've been through a divorce and
there are days where I'm like,

82
00:04:57,371 --> 00:05:00,360
I don't know if I want to trust, but then
I'll meet people and I'm like, no, I,

83
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,590
I can trust.
And I build it gradually.

84
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:07,870
Time gives you experiences that rebuilds
you to where you need to be later on.

85
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:11,170
And that's how it heals
you. So, yeah. So true.

86
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:16,070
My body has changed for the worst after
a major accident and I can't bring

87
00:05:16,071 --> 00:05:19,970
myself to be intimate with my boyfriend
because I'm scared he'll be repulsed by

88
00:05:19,971 --> 00:05:20,804
how I look.

89
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:25,160
Is it better to break off the relationship
since I can't give him what he wants?

90
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:29,900
It didn't want to say you're a Rockstar
for surviving this, you know, um,

91
00:05:29,901 --> 00:05:33,950
I can't even imagine what you've been
through, but just remember that, you know,

92
00:05:33,951 --> 00:05:38,250
you have not changed. I'm
sure your partner is still
thinks that way. Yeah. Yeah.

93
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:42,040
And probably all of us have
had at some point in our life,

94
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,830
like really painful things
that have happened that have
made us who we are today,

95
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:48,670
even though it's been a point
of great pain in her life.

96
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:52,600
Learning to see it as it's making me
who I am today, it's made me stronger.

97
00:05:52,601 --> 00:05:55,060
It's made me better. Right? I
think it's for a lot of women,

98
00:05:55,061 --> 00:05:58,700
it's like a lifetime journey that we
experienced. It's roller coasters.

99
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:02,640
When I was 11, um, I was
diagnosed with OCD and um,

100
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,310
something called Trichotillomania,

101
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:08,930
which is like a compulsive behavior of
hair plucking. And so ever since I was 10,

102
00:06:08,931 --> 00:06:09,410
11,

103
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:14,060
I had to wear eyeliner and eye brow pencil
and I've literally never said this to

104
00:06:14,061 --> 00:06:15,140
anyone.
So you are like,

105
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:22,670
as a kid I just liked registered that
like I'm ugly, I'm going to cry right now.

106
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:27,680
So I have had to wear makeup my whole
life and I've always felt like I can't

107
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:31,540
make eye contact with anyone.
I can't be seen and um,

108
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:35,330
went through a lot and I
like managed to control it.

109
00:06:35,331 --> 00:06:37,070
It still happens every once in a while.

110
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:40,760
But I always thought that if
I ever enter a relationship,

111
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:45,680
he would find that really ugly and leave.
And then on top of that,

112
00:06:45,681 --> 00:06:50,180
being a Muslim woman that wears the
head cover, I'm facing a lot of, um,

113
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,180
ironically it's not discrimination
from the outside world,

114
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,700
but it's like my own Muslim
communities. Like, you know,

115
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,520
a lot of men don't want a woman
that wears the head cover.

116
00:06:58,521 --> 00:07:03,470
And so I've had opportunities where I've
been rejected for choosing to practice

117
00:07:03,471 --> 00:07:05,120
my faith by my own people.

118
00:07:05,121 --> 00:07:09,470
And so I can totally relate
to that because it just, it's,

119
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:13,130
it's really unfair the pressures that
they put on a women's expectations.

120
00:07:13,131 --> 00:07:14,870
It's like you're not even seeing who I am.

121
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:19,550
It's just been this ongoing journey
of, no, I love who I am as a person,

122
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:21,410
but I don't know if I
love what I look like.

123
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:26,360
This is such a good example of
even our own perceptions, right?

124
00:07:26,361 --> 00:07:29,960
Because all I've been doing is staring
at how gorgeous you are. Right?

125
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,520
So from my perspective,

126
00:07:31,521 --> 00:07:36,521
I'm sitting here and I just think you're
so beautiful and yet you struggle with

127
00:07:36,741 --> 00:07:39,740
that. All of us can relate to that.
Right? And so thank you for sharing that.

128
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:44,180
My advice would be be honest.

129
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:47,180
If this is your intimate partner
who's chosen you for you,

130
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:50,870
they should have absolutely no problem
being there and supporting you and loving

131
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:54,740
you regardless of any physical or
even emotional changes that happen.

132
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:58,980
That's a relationship. Right? You know,

133
00:07:58,981 --> 00:08:03,981
sometimes we do forget that it's important
to uplift one another and we forget

134
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:07,500
that, you know, other
folks have troubles too.

135
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:10,500
And it's important to
help them and advise them.

136
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:15,180
We have way more in common than we have
in differences and these were amazing

137
00:08:15,181 --> 00:08:19,440
women to sit with today and just talk
to real life stuff that so many of us

138
00:08:19,441 --> 00:08:20,274
women face.

139
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:24,180
I ended up revealing a lot about myself
that I'm not usually comfortable sharing,

140
00:08:24,181 --> 00:08:28,750
but um, it felt like a safe space and
it just reminds me that we're all human,

141
00:08:28,751 --> 00:08:32,160
so we end up experiencing the
same things at the end of the day.

142
00:08:32,161 --> 00:08:34,650
And so it was just a unifying experience.
