1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,210
Did you say that I sniff out loud?

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:05,240
No,
but that's a good one.

3
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:12,143
Sorry.

4
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:23,230
Really like Quirky, unique,
fun and communicative

5
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:25,940
with a lot of love with a lot of love.

6
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:33,400
I'm going to play Africa by toto.
Oh God, I can't hear anything.

7
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,680
So this, let's do that. And He'd
hate to hear you say right now.

8
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:38,220
I'm tired of listening to Africa by toto.

9
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:44,180
By the very first time I saw a j
a I thought he was really nice.

10
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:51,310
He looked friendly.
So that's why we went and just chatted.

11
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:01,750
I didn't make the bed
this morning. Huh? Uh,

12
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:05,460
well I met her at an audition.
She recognized me and she's like,

13
00:01:05,461 --> 00:01:09,240
are you a j Rafael? Um, I used to listen
to you in middle school. She said,

14
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,600
I was really hoping that she would like
tweet about me so I could find her.

15
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:16,680
Sounds kind of creepy.

16
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,210
Um,
I said that he was,

17
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:24,010
he looked very friendly
and I don't actually,

18
00:01:24,011 --> 00:01:26,080
I don't think I said approachable,
but I meant to say look,

19
00:01:26,081 --> 00:01:30,310
friendly and approachable is so that's
why we ended up chatting in the corner of

20
00:01:30,311 --> 00:01:32,350
that audition at Disneyland.

21
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:36,110
Yes. What did she say? Ah, well,

22
00:01:36,111 --> 00:01:39,980
I said I was really hoping
that you would tweet about me.

23
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:41,280
Oh my God.

24
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:51,150
Our first date was when we went
to see Jo Koy at the Improv show.

25
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,980
I was reading your lips.
She literally said this,

26
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:59,160
our first date was that a Jo Koy concert.

27
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,440
I think that's when I first made it
clear that like, let's make this a date.

28
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,870
I said, Joe Quigg concert.
Did you read that?

29
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:09,110
My, yeah, I said that. I said, Jo Koy.

30
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:14,350
He forgets a lot of his own schedule.

31
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,240
Like I try to plan things,

32
00:02:16,241 --> 00:02:20,680
but then we forget that he has like
a shoot or something like that.

33
00:02:20,681 --> 00:02:25,120
So it's kind of just comes down to like
him being a little bit disorganized,

34
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:28,150
but that would be just one
thing that bugs me a little bit.

35
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,240
Sometimes I have to be like to clean.
It's like I liked it.

36
00:02:33,241 --> 00:02:37,780
Just throw my shoes at the
door or not make the bed.

37
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,510
She kind of nags at me
a little bit for that,

38
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:45,790
but it's fine is not even a big thing
really. It doesn't really buy. Okay.

39
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:46,750
The other day bothered me.

40
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:52,150
Did you say that I s I sniff out loud?

41
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,190
No,
but that's a good one.

42
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:02,380
Um, I said that you were a
bit disorganized. Okay. Yeah,

43
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:06,460
I know. It's just, I'm just so shocked.

44
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:10,800
I said one thing that bothers me is
that you don't let me be dislike.

45
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:20,600
I would just miss his presence.
I love when and where does hanging out.

46
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,130
We don't even have to be doing anything.

47
00:03:22,131 --> 00:03:26,150
We could be working on two separate
things at the same time or just sitting at

48
00:03:26,151 --> 00:03:29,780
home watching TV.
A lot of the little things in his little,

49
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:32,900
the little quirks and the little
weird things we do together.

50
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,610
A lot of like small things like,

51
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:39,090
like we make up a lot
of songs like every day.

52
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:44,740
If she was gone right now I would miss
her voice a lot because she already

53
00:03:44,741 --> 00:03:46,480
doesn't sing that much when she should.

54
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:51,290
Wait was the question if you went away
forever or like a week because I think I

55
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:55,400
answered it as if it was like as if
you left for like a couple of days.

56
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:58,910
It was like,
I love things that he does a little things

57
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:01,510
also in the context where
I thought you were dead.

58
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:07,790
Oh, I didn't answer it like that.
Oh, I'm gone a lot. So like yeah,

59
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:11,020
you can handle a couple of days. Yeah.
That's why. That's why it was no big deal.

60
00:04:11,021 --> 00:04:14,840
That's why I was like, I mean,
I wouldn't mrs like being there,

61
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I think our biggest fight has been about
something in his past that I have had

62
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,790
issues or I struggled to let go of.

63
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:38,330
It was a big fight that
happened a while ago,

64
00:04:38,331 --> 00:04:40,280
but it still comes up here and there.

65
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:46,440
A recent big one kind of stemmed from,

66
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,890
uh,
my ex girlfriend.

67
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,600
Um, yeah, I don't,

68
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:02,550
I don't know how much detail to go
into, but it just, you know, like the,

69
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:07,730
my past relationships or dislike a part
of me growing to be this man that I am

70
00:05:09,841 --> 00:05:14,340
for her now. I think it's hard to
explain that perspective sometimes.

71
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:17,430
Like she cuts off for acts as
completely and doesn't talk to them.

72
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:22,020
A lot of people like hate the
people that they bid with. And it's,

73
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,550
it's hard to say that
because I don't hate them.

74
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:32,480
I just wish she understood how much I
love her and how much I see her as the

75
00:05:33,961 --> 00:05:38,550
main person in my life, you know?
And I think she's seen a lot of that.

76
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:44,400
Whoever was like a main person in my life
and she is trying to fill their shoes,

77
00:05:44,401 --> 00:05:49,290
but like, they're, you know, they're
part of my past and she is like,

78
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,710
she's my present and my future.

79
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,730
I said our biggest fight has
been about a face in your path,

80
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:01,160
but I saw it. I couldn't read your
lips. He said ex girlfriends. So

81
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:06,650
there it is. Yeah. I mean, that's just
the way you are with everything. No,

82
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:11,270
you're not a person to cut people off
and you continue to like maintain your

83
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:15,200
relationships at the end
of the day. Uh, I love you.

84
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,580
I'm sorry if it's a big thing.
I Dunno.

85
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:25,530
I'm going to cry. Well, I,

86
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:30,840
I mean, I just, I know I love
you. Like, I know it's not like,

87
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:32,003
uh,

88
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:37,980
it's not something that I'm going to just
let define our relationship and define

89
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:38,814
why.

90
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:43,080
Like we would end our relationship because
it's so like what we have is way more

91
00:06:43,081 --> 00:06:46,680
than that. And even though we
have like bumps in the road,

92
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:51,480
I still love you and I'm always
going to live you. So yeah,

93
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:56,470
sorry, I'm crying. But yeah,
we struggle a lot. We do.

94
00:06:56,471 --> 00:06:57,304
Um,

95
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:02,720
but we work on it and we get through
every five or every struggle and I know we

96
00:07:03,241 --> 00:07:04,260
get stronger from it.

97
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,800
Um, I think maybe you don't
hear it enough for me,

98
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:09,620
but like they see a future with us.

99
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:11,203
I know

100
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:19,110
patience and learning that were
very different in the way we think.

101
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:24,310
Obviously you can't just
have one way of thinking.

102
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,780
You have to put yourself in the
other person's shoes. Balance.

103
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:33,670
I think the importance of quality time,
not just with us,

104
00:07:33,671 --> 00:07:38,410
but like quality time with myself too,
and to be a little more organized.

105
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:40,630
We're not always going to agree on things,

106
00:07:40,631 --> 00:07:44,800
but knowing that there's an end goal
and that we're still learning how to be

107
00:07:44,801 --> 00:07:47,680
adaptable to one another
at the end of the day,

108
00:07:47,681 --> 00:07:52,681
I think we both see a future with a
family and being married and all the cool

109
00:07:55,901 --> 00:07:58,980
stuff that comes with being together.
Yeah,

110
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:06,510
it feels like our relationship
is kind of like an adventure.

111
00:08:06,511 --> 00:08:10,560
Like I never really know what the next
step is where I've always been the person

112
00:08:10,561 --> 00:08:13,620
to always want to know what the next step
is. But with him it's been different.

113
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:16,780
A lot of my friends and people,
I haven't talked to her a lot of time,

114
00:08:16,781 --> 00:08:20,670
they see that I've like posted about my
girlfriend a lot and some they're like,

115
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:20,771
well,

116
00:08:20,771 --> 00:08:23,560
I've never seen you post this much about
your girlfriend and things like that.

117
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:28,650
I think people see like how much love
I have for her and I think it's because

118
00:08:29,051 --> 00:08:34,051
she's made me want to like be loud and
proud about who I am with her and and who

119
00:08:34,871 --> 00:08:35,704
we are together.

120
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:39,290
I don't know.
I love how it feels so natural with you,

121
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:43,580
and I've never had a relationship where
it felt this natural before and it

122
00:08:43,581 --> 00:08:45,520
happened when we didn't even expect it.

123
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:48,930
Even through all the ups and
downs and stuff, we still,

124
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,740
we still love each other through it.

125
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,020
You're worth every single
thing they go through.

126
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:00,463
We,

127
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,030
oh shoot.
