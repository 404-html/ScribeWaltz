1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,180
I'd seen all these negative things
saying, Oh, if you're a Trump supporter,

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:06,390
you're a Nazi, you're this, you're
that. And I'm not those things.

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,730
I love my country.
I love my president.

4
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:14,143
Okay.

5
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,960
Probably
three,

6
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,440
two,
one.

7
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,320
I disagree because I have literally
gotten death threats for expressing my

8
00:00:45,361 --> 00:00:48,720
public opinion on politics, on
supported the president. I mean,

9
00:00:48,721 --> 00:00:51,330
I'm not going to stop
expressing my opinion,

10
00:00:51,331 --> 00:00:53,880
but I still disagree that
I feel safe doing so.

11
00:00:53,881 --> 00:00:55,950
I think most Americans don't at this time.

12
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:01,370
I do not believe that
suppressing my opinions from
people does anything good for

13
00:01:02,251 --> 00:01:06,270
the, for the betterment of society, but
it's part member of the LGBT community.

14
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,890
It's pretty hard to hold those views.
Um,

15
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:14,160
and I just purposefully make a decision
that I'm going to be responsible for my

16
00:01:14,161 --> 00:01:18,420
own safety and um, I don't let
anybody intimidate me that way.

17
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:19,201
Me,

18
00:01:19,201 --> 00:01:23,400
I'm a skateboarder and an industry that
is pretty much dominantly liberal where

19
00:01:23,401 --> 00:01:26,940
the graphics are of Trump shaking hands
with the KKK. I've been spit on before.

20
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,080
I've been cursed at.

21
00:01:28,081 --> 00:01:31,620
I've had my board tried to be broken from
skateboarders even though I don't feel

22
00:01:31,621 --> 00:01:32,940
safe at wearing it publicly,

23
00:01:32,941 --> 00:01:36,030
I will continue to do so because
I will not have my voice silence

24
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:37,930
issues about

25
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:46,010
three two.
Why

26
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:56,070
I somewhat agree that they're
not important. Let me tell
you, let me explain why.

27
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:00,870
Because the same issues of the black
community affect all communities and if we

28
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:03,780
are Americans,
if we truly consider ourselves Americans,

29
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:08,520
my issues are no different from his
issued or hurry shoes or her issues or her

30
00:02:08,521 --> 00:02:10,290
issues or his issues,

31
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,860
whether you're white or
black or brown or green.

32
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:17,870
I'm going to say I strongly
disagree and all due respect.

33
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:21,080
I disagree because there are different
issues in the black community then are in

34
00:02:21,081 --> 00:02:25,220
other communities. There's higher crime
rates, there's higher abortion rates,

35
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:28,160
there's crime and violence
within this community.

36
00:02:28,161 --> 00:02:33,161
There's a lot of hatred
within my community being
black against police officers

37
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:36,110
and those are specific
to the black community.

38
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:40,390
That is a very good point, but we
as Americans, whether you're black,

39
00:02:40,391 --> 00:02:45,040
brown or white, you have a certain
obligation to the civil society.

40
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,180
So I have the obligation to stop
when the police officer says stop.

41
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,740
So I'm giving that as an example,

42
00:02:50,741 --> 00:02:55,741
which is happened in many cases where
abuse has followed because the black runs

43
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,540
and he fights back.

44
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,130
I agree with that,
but

45
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:05,130
what you just said, you took 20 seconds
to explain a black issue, so he,

46
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:09,100
it is a problem, but of course everyone
is responsible for that problem,

47
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:13,270
but this community is hurting and they're
just as American as everybody else.

48
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:20,670
Oh, ball three two. What

49
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:30,240
I strongly agree that we need the wall.
It's not a matter of racial issues,

50
00:03:30,241 --> 00:03:33,420
but national security, let
me say that first. First off,

51
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:36,150
every one out of every three
illegals comes with a federal crime,

52
00:03:36,151 --> 00:03:39,060
whether it's murder or rape
or even drug cartel. Also,

53
00:03:39,061 --> 00:03:40,320
we talked about black issues.

54
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:43,020
What about the illegal immigrants
that come that are dreamers,

55
00:03:43,021 --> 00:03:46,140
but what about the American black
dream or his dream is to be a lawyer.

56
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,200
His dream to go to college and his dreams
to become something and get out the

57
00:03:49,201 --> 00:03:52,470
hood. The Sally, we allow
these illegals to one pass.

58
00:03:52,471 --> 00:03:55,530
Those who are waiting for a long time
to illegally come to the country because

59
00:03:55,531 --> 00:03:57,780
there is a difference and it's
almost a slap in the face.

60
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,100
I do know at my school,
it's a public university.

61
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:05,780
They give out free college to
undocumented students. Yet here I am.

62
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,700
I come from a middle class family,

63
00:04:07,701 --> 00:04:10,400
but I don't get any scholarships
like I get very little.

64
00:04:10,401 --> 00:04:13,820
I can barely afford college at these
people who aren't even US citizens.

65
00:04:13,821 --> 00:04:18,150
They get all these benefits that I myself
as an American citizen can't get. Yeah,

66
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:22,870
I somewhat agree to this. I think
the wall is, is useful and essential,

67
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:28,260
but the real issue is what can we do
to make our country have a much easier

68
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:33,610
system to,
for people to come in in a legal fashion.

69
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:38,170
It's the procedure that is too
difficult, too long, too cumbersome.

70
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:43,030
We'd love to have him come in. They
benefit us, they help us to grow.

71
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,650
They provide new ideas,

72
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:50,100
but let's be rational about this and to
keep it equal with the citizens of this

73
00:04:50,141 --> 00:04:51,400
country who are already here.

74
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:53,613
Aye.

75
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,850
Three. Two. Why?

76
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,080
I guess the reason I somewhat agree,
it depends what you mean by a support.

77
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:11,690
If anyone Derris to mess with her,
I'm gonna kick their ass.

78
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:15,530
So like she's got my support 100% but
if you're asking me as a Christian,

79
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,860
I'm going to loves him and matter
what they are. We're all, like I said,

80
00:05:18,861 --> 00:05:21,860
it's an American issue and we're
all supposed to give this together.

81
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:25,370
If it's contrary to natural law,
which it is in my view,

82
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,770
then I don't agree with
it. However, I can,

83
00:05:27,771 --> 00:05:32,771
like you as a person with the LGBT
community that is in a pretty much has

84
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:36,470
morphed into a gay rights organization.

85
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:41,530
So they fight for rights that are
outside of the natural rights of the

86
00:05:43,131 --> 00:05:45,860
declaration of
independence, life, liberty,

87
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,520
and the pursuit of happiness within
the boundaries of natural law.

88
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:54,550
So that's why I don't support the
LGBT community in bear activism,

89
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:59,920
but I do support them as human beings
with the same rights as I have no extra

90
00:06:01,251 --> 00:06:05,600
rights, no extra right to
marry. Same Sex, but the same,

91
00:06:05,601 --> 00:06:06,860
right as I have

92
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:11,660
put your, put your right, say you
can marry whoever you want. Oh,

93
00:06:11,661 --> 00:06:13,100
very good. Okay. Good point.

94
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,090
There are a lot of features
in the LGBT community.

95
00:06:17,091 --> 00:06:18,950
There are a little bit hard to deal with.

96
00:06:18,951 --> 00:06:22,280
I don't identify with a lot of those
people identify as a transgender person,

97
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:26,510
not necessarily as a gay or lesbian
person. My wife on the other hand,

98
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:30,260
all of a sudden found herself
in a same sex marriage. Uh,

99
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,660
it was not something
that you signed up for.

100
00:06:32,661 --> 00:06:37,160
Same sex marriage is a different thing,
but who cares who you love?

101
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:42,490
I'm very active in the Republican Party
and I'm trying to make a big inroads

102
00:06:42,981 --> 00:06:47,981
with the religious freedom and the super
conservative religious people because

103
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:52,190
they need to learn to deal with me
because I'm going, I'm not going anywhere.

104
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:55,910
You know, you live your life,
you doesn't agree with my life.

105
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,660
I shouldn't feel compelled to affect
your life because I don't agree with it.

106
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,090
Is it good role model or are

107
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,300
three, two, one

108
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:13,400
hell yeah. Probably gonna
get a lot of flack for this.

109
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,540
I strongly agree. He's strong
and he is fighting for Americans.

110
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:21,140
He listens to what we want and yeah,
he doesn't always tweet the best stuff,

111
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:22,880
but I mean everybody's done that.

112
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:26,510
But the fact of the matter is that he
has principles and now he's standing for

113
00:07:26,511 --> 00:07:29,750
what he believes in and he's taking
us to the future. A safer, better,

114
00:07:29,751 --> 00:07:32,030
stronger America for all of us.

115
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:36,460
A reason why someone agrees because I
don't think any president should be a role

116
00:07:36,461 --> 00:07:39,750
model for children. I think there
should be a role model for American,

117
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:41,770
like American men and grown adults.

118
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:44,560
So I don't think Trump should be a role
model for children because if so he had

119
00:07:44,561 --> 00:07:47,560
to be PC all the damn time,
which does nothing but heard Americans.

120
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:50,050
He's the old school. Tell you
straight up, see your face.

121
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,470
The doctor that tells you the truth,

122
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:54,040
he tells you you got to lose a hundred
pounds and stop smoking and you'll die.

123
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:55,690
You get mad,
you might get assaulted,

124
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,520
but you find out he's only
one telling you the truth.

125
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:01,860
I somewhat agree as well because I think
that he's a good role model because he

126
00:08:01,861 --> 00:08:06,861
sets out what he's going to do and then
he goes and does it and he's also a good

127
00:08:07,081 --> 00:08:09,660
role model because of some
of the things he says,

128
00:08:09,661 --> 00:08:14,661
which is not acceptable and
that is what real life is about.

129
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:18,510
It's not that somebody is perfect
and never make some mistake.

130
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,160
People make mistakes.

131
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:24,330
They repent from their mistakes and
they go out and do something positive.

132
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:36,140
Three, two, one. Ah,
that's such a hard one.

133
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:40,960
I did lose a couple of friends.

134
00:08:40,961 --> 00:08:44,140
I went to school with a Trump shirt on
and I brought a Trump flag and waved it

135
00:08:44,141 --> 00:08:44,710
around.

136
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:48,670
I had a couple teachers get really mad
at me and that may have affected my grade

137
00:08:48,671 --> 00:08:51,730
at the end of the year,
even though I lost some relationships.

138
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:55,740
I've built really good friends and I
just really get along with who think

139
00:08:55,741 --> 00:08:58,920
similar to me or accept what I think.
They don't have to agree with me.

140
00:08:58,921 --> 00:09:02,580
But if you're in a community where
people can accept you for who you are,

141
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:05,520
those are the true people you need
to surround yourself in. I mean,

142
00:09:05,521 --> 00:09:09,450
I lost friends, family
members, supporters,

143
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,890
business associates.

144
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:16,070
When I came out for Donald Trump
in 2017 February at the grammys,

145
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:20,370
I wore dresses. I said make America
great again. So I knew I would, you know,

146
00:09:20,371 --> 00:09:25,320
create a stir but hitting number
one on iTunes, Amazon billboard,

147
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:30,180
my album rose to number one because of
Trump supporters. So I've lost things.

148
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:35,210
What I've also maintained this new
community based on who I truly am,

149
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:40,410
know any relationship that you lose as
a result of supporting Trump has no real

150
00:09:40,411 --> 00:09:44,040
relationship anyway because he's
only there temporarily. I mean,

151
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,930
this is what everybody keeps forgetting.
I mean,

152
00:09:45,931 --> 00:09:49,110
this guy is only going to be here
for what, another four or five years.

153
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:51,390
And so I want to remind everybody of that.
You know,

154
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:55,440
it's not the end of the world. Not
yet. It's getting there, but not yet.

155
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:03,330
Great again. Alright, three,

156
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:04,920
two,
one.

157
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,580
I mean it's Kinda easy.

158
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,530
Oh, come on. You can get over here.

159
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,860
I strongly agree. Um, there's some issues.

160
00:10:14,861 --> 00:10:18,520
The man has got some idiosyncrasies
to drive us all a little bit nuts,

161
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:22,300
but overall, I mean, he's a businessman.
He knows how to make business happen.

162
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,250
I mean, we're, we're talking the
fact that we're even talking Sherpa.

163
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,220
Some people are grumpy and
don't like what he tweets,

164
00:10:28,221 --> 00:10:30,740
but you're having conversations about it.
He's waking up.

165
00:10:30,741 --> 00:10:35,300
So he is making America great again, is
making America, dare I say it woke again.

166
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,530
Trump is making America great again,

167
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:42,030
but the people around him are trying to
undermine him. And even in his own party,

168
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:44,730
he can only do so much.
He's not a dictator.

169
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:46,860
And this is where we
have to remember that.

170
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:57,160
Okay.
That's

171
00:10:58,930 --> 00:10:59,110
right.
