1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,730
What do you think overall
was the hardest part?

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,850
The divorce.
It was the hardest,

3
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:16,550
you know, time of my life at least. Um,

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,320
it was just as there's a dark,
dark time.

5
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,050
So first off,

6
00:00:25,051 --> 00:00:29,340
can you just say your name and Jimmy Chai?

7
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,470
40 years old.

8
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,890
Taletha Chai,
41,

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,290
don't believe him.
Uh,

10
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:47,730
we were in college working for the,
uh,

11
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:52,740
the college newspaper and he came running
in and he had long hair at the time.

12
00:00:53,711 --> 00:00:55,570
It looked like an Asian Jesus.
I don't know.

13
00:00:55,571 --> 00:01:00,571
There was just something about him that
I liked and I hadn't even really heard

14
00:01:01,091 --> 00:01:03,310
him talk much.
Just something about his presence.

15
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:08,050
I like thought up something to ask him
and we just started talking from there.

16
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:12,493
Okay.

17
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,740
Uh,
she borrowed money from me.

18
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,780
There was a time when I'm at night where
we were just bored and just laying out

19
00:01:20,851 --> 00:01:23,370
the paper.
And so there was a,

20
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:28,610
a calendar of quotes on the date of the
table and if you want to say like these

21
00:01:28,921 --> 00:01:33,600
inspirational things. And so I
would tell her, hey, as a joke,

22
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:34,920
anytime someone walks to the door,

23
00:01:34,921 --> 00:01:38,220
I'm just going to sneak in a quote to
the person and just see if they catch it

24
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,100
and she would die laughing. Do you
know any way? Lessen the jokes.

25
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:47,100
I think I just want a little bit.
So that's when I knew so many, uh,

26
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,420
so many what you could
actually,

27
00:01:54,421 --> 00:01:55,920
I don't know if she wants
me to tell her this story,

28
00:01:55,921 --> 00:02:00,060
but I'm going to say it
anyway. Can you hear me? No.

29
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:05,850
One time she, um, she,

30
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:11,160
she was driving home and she had
to go to the bathroom to go pee.

31
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:14,430
And so instead of pulling over because
she was rushing home and I don't remember

32
00:02:14,431 --> 00:02:17,790
why she was rushing home,
but she had a coffee cup in her thing.

33
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:20,700
And so she peed in a coffee cup. She's
gonna hate me for this, by the way.

34
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,690
I know she didn't hit me,
but it's okay.

35
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:32,120
We just, without saying anything,
know what the other person,

36
00:02:32,121 --> 00:02:35,300
where they're going to go and what
they're going to say are almost like

37
00:02:35,301 --> 00:02:37,400
finishing each other's
sentences or something. Yeah.

38
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:43,500
She's a very, like probably the
most pure hearted person I know.

39
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:47,580
Like we have two beautiful daughters
right now and I wouldn't want anybody else

40
00:02:47,581 --> 00:02:51,680
to be the mother of my children.
Looking back,

41
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,930
it's like you forget the little moments,
you know?

42
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:57,500
Like I was telling him the story about
how we used to have the calendar,

43
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:00,440
remember never enough to close when
people walk in and you'd be dying that,

44
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,120
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

45
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:08,690
Things that other people would think
would just be so wrong with us as we're

46
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,100
like, no, that's that to be happening.

47
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:18,290
I knew I wanted to give me the mother
of my children because of who you are.

48
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:23,070
Like I knew you'd be an amazing mother.
It was just like a heads down delete.

49
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,230
Just going to be an amazing mom.

50
00:03:24,231 --> 00:03:26,180
And I wanted this woman to
be the mother of my children

51
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,110
early.
Yeah.

52
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:39,340
It wasn't what I would call a typical
dating courtship where it leads up to a

53
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:47,210
proposal. It was very up and down.
It was an emotional rollercoaster.

54
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:49,841
Well,

55
00:03:49,841 --> 00:03:53,920
we were still just so disconnected at
the time and so our communication really

56
00:03:53,921 --> 00:03:56,050
wasn't there. Like, I
don't know, we just sort of

57
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,320
let it pass by

58
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:06,840
that couple unit. Um, just
seems like 200 people, right?

59
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:07,230
Yeah.

60
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:10,410
I got to see the one thing that we found
common ground and always was Seinfeld

61
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:14,100
when Seinfeld was huge and the one
thing that would always bring us back

62
00:04:14,101 --> 00:04:17,490
together dating us, it's
like Seinfeld, okay,

63
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,830
we're finding those flashlights
all is good with the world.

64
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:28,460
I was on the living room floor and
I was playing with our two children.

65
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,960
It was just like late at night.

66
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:35,170
And I remember realizing all of a sudden
that I was very lonely and that um,

67
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,680
I felt like a single mom

68
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,553
and how

69
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:48,930
they were three and five,
they wouldn't remember a whole lot.

70
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:54,410
I just knew that the healthier route
would be to do this now and we weren't

71
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:58,920
where people that would not
want to live our life like that.

72
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:02,370
It was a lot of this is how
you're supposed to be. Like,

73
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,960
why won't you be like this?

74
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,260
No, to be honest with you, looking back,

75
00:05:14,261 --> 00:05:17,410
it was just more of a frustration from
my side and I blamed her for a lot of

76
00:05:17,411 --> 00:05:17,621
stuff.

77
00:05:17,621 --> 00:05:22,621
So I played a lot of victim and I felt
very stifled and looking back it was more

78
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:28,090
me than it was her. I knew we shouldn't
have been married to begin with,

79
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,790
so it wasn't like a,
I knew the marriage was over,

80
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:34,000
like we fought on our wedding
day the whole time. It was crazy.

81
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:38,950
We were so attached to the way it looked
like and on top of that I had pressure

82
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:40,743
from my family.

83
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:44,650
It wasn't fair to her and like she
had no shot to be honest with you,

84
00:05:44,651 --> 00:05:48,730
with me now looking back, oh my
gosh, I self sabotage the whole way

85
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,400
most of my life. It was just easier
to just keep everything inside,

86
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:59,060
deal with it myself and
just react to things.

87
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:02,360
And so I regret not telling you in a,

88
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:06,620
in a really productive
way what I needed most,

89
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,160
which was what a partnership

90
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:13,520
to walk next to each other.

91
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:21,520
It was just awkward bill
for a very long time.

92
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:26,380
Eventually just the friendship
started to come back. We,

93
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:31,530
we've, we talk about the same things.
We find the same things interesting. Um,

94
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:36,460
he is one of the longest relationships
that I've had in my life besides that

95
00:06:36,461 --> 00:06:38,980
we'd had in our lives besides
our parents and our siblings.

96
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,920
We just want to be the best
people we could possibly be.

97
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:47,020
Our marriage was filled with just holding
our faults to each other and you know,

98
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:51,280
holding, holding what was right or wrong
about each other against each other.

99
00:06:51,281 --> 00:06:54,790
And now we're really obsessed with that.

100
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:58,960
There is no right and there is no
wrong and we're really obsessed with,

101
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:03,940
I'm not giving up. We're really
obsessed with that. This is a process.

102
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:06,973
I mean,

103
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:10,140
to be honest with you,
if you look at our relationship now,

104
00:07:10,141 --> 00:07:14,190
people would think we're married because
we get along so well and I don't know

105
00:07:14,191 --> 00:07:18,510
too many couples that get along like us.
Whether you're married or not married.

106
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:23,790
It's difficult for my relationships
that I have now with girlfriends because

107
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:27,570
they don't understand this.
I can't.

108
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:30,090
And so that's why I don't have,
that's why I'm single.

109
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:31,380
Okay.

110
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,220
That

111
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:39,260
I value this relationship that has been
such a big part of who I am because we

112
00:07:43,381 --> 00:07:44,250
have children.

113
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:49,830
I know that we're going to have a
relationship for a really long time.

114
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,660
And

115
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:58,710
I guess just sometimes I imagine the
end of my life being able to look at you

116
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:01,080
and without saying a word no,

117
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:06,060
that we shared a pretty amazing journey.

118
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:13,820
I, I wish I was kinder to you.
I wish I was more understanding.

119
00:08:13,821 --> 00:08:18,230
I wish was more authentic
and wish I was there more.

120
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,800
She had no idea

121
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,540
what I regretted the most,

122
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:32,541
was not being open enough and are
really telling you what was on my mind.

123
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,960
For me it was I wish over kinder to you.

124
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:43,933
Okay.

125
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,850
Honest,
authentic,

126
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:52,940
loving and, and another thing that
I didn't say was like committed.

127
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:57,210
I was one foot in one foot out a lot
of ways. What was it fair to you?

128
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:00,290
Yeah,
we see the world the same way.

129
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:02,990
We just don't live in
the world the same way

130
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:07,690
we've been talked about us as
a unit in a very long time.

131
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:11,320
It's always about the kids.
So it's pretty interesting.

132
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,970
Yeah. To us. This is really
the only unit that we know.

133
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:19,780
I talked a little bit about just how
friendship was always just an underlying

134
00:09:19,781 --> 00:09:21,170
thing. Yeah. So

135
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,150
yeah, we were always really
good friends to each other.

136
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,640
Okay. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you. Yeah.

137
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:36,500
Okay.
