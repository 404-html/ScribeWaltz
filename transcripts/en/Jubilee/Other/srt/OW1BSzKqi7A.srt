1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,270
I started using cocaine and
Lsd when I was 12 years old.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,770
I stopped taking LSD when I jumped out
of a window and fractured two of my ribs.

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,880
However, I still use drugs
due to my depression and
because they helped me forget

4
00:00:11,881 --> 00:00:15,580
everything.
12 years old.

5
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:16,960
That's young.

6
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:43,950
My Dad has been a heavy alcoholic all my
life now he's suffering from liver and

7
00:00:44,471 --> 00:00:49,420
kidney failure because he won't stop
ounce speak to him anymore and ignore his

8
00:00:49,421 --> 00:00:50,254
calls.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I had a relative in my life who
also had a drinking problem.

10
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,910
There are a lot of feelings that come
with it and there's a lot of rage that

11
00:01:00,911 --> 00:01:05,650
comes with it. I don't blame you
for not wanting to talk to him, but

12
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,060
try if he can find it in yourself.
I'm not saying forgive.

13
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:16,250
I think that may help them a lot too
because it's an addiction as a disease.

14
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,720
I stole money from my boss to
support my gambling addiction.

15
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,650
He ended accuser accusing.
My mom was stealing it.

16
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:30,443
The reason I'm

17
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:35,670
this really like this was me to the t,

18
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:37,763
but

19
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:42,960
I have a lot of people around me that a
don't allow me to do this and if I do do

20
00:01:42,961 --> 00:01:46,400
it, they're there for me. If
you want the help, it's there.

21
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,480
At the age of 11,

22
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:57,540
I sought a comfort of pornography due
to feeling that my parents saw me as

23
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:58,993
inadequate.

24
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:03,910
Every moment I was anxious that my secret
would be exposed and that my perceived

25
00:02:03,911 --> 00:02:07,120
reality would become real.
That nobody could love me.

26
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:15,110
I've felt for a long time that nobody
could love me and I thought that my

27
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:18,810
parents didn't think that
I was adequate either.

28
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:23,090
And reaching for other things to fill
that hole is really common. Yeah.

29
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,430
And I can empathize with that.

30
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,230
I'm only 16.

31
00:02:29,231 --> 00:02:33,280
I've been valley addiction
with prescription pain
medication that I received for

32
00:02:33,281 --> 00:02:34,450
an injury three years ago.

33
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:44,430
Oh,
we read that one.

34
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,263
Okay.

35
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,630
I'm only 16 and barely addiction.

36
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:57,140
It's prescription pain medication that I
received for an injury three years ago.

37
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,430
I don't want to die this young,
but I'm too afraid.

38
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:01,653
Totally parents.

39
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:07,330
Um,

40
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:12,330
I know it's like to be I did to the drug
is 16 since I been getting high as this

41
00:03:12,741 --> 00:03:15,520
house.
14 surely 16 million got so much.

42
00:03:15,521 --> 00:03:18,060
Hope so much live for it and
I probably hear that a lot.

43
00:03:18,061 --> 00:03:22,360
And you don't believe it. I had no, I
didn't. It's hard to have that secret.

44
00:03:22,361 --> 00:03:27,010
I get it. But um, if you keep holding
that pain in, it's going to kill you.

45
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:34,210
My best friend is addicted to taking drugs
to help her cope with her depression.

46
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:39,070
And one of the few people who know it
feels like I'm carrying something heavy

47
00:03:39,071 --> 00:03:40,120
around with me.

48
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:47,390
I feel like you should try to talk to
her and help her get some help before it

49
00:03:49,741 --> 00:03:53,850
gets too late because
I had to deal with that.

50
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,980
I had to watch my own boyfriend
passed away because I'm,

51
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,180
I couldn't really help him.

52
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:13,783
Hmm.

53
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,200
Okay.

54
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:20,100
I am diagnosed with severe depression
and I'm addicted to cutting myself.

55
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,780
I've only told one person about this and
I know deep down they're disappointed

56
00:04:24,781 --> 00:04:27,720
in me. I wish someone could
support me without judgment.

57
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,003
Okay.

58
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:35,490
I've done a lot of things
to cope with my depression.

59
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:40,300
It's been almost a year since
the night,

60
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:44,600
and I never ever thought it was possible
to go that long without it ever.

61
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,930
If you don't believe in yourself and
no one's there to tell you that they

62
00:04:47,931 --> 00:04:52,490
believe in you, then I do.
And so many other people do

63
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:02,320
never talked about that before.
You know,

64
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,590
when we go to support groups
or meetings or whatever it is,

65
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,420
you put our problems out there because
unfortunately there's other people that

66
00:05:11,421 --> 00:05:15,320
have had this happen to them.
You know, we are not alone.

67
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:19,850
You know, there's always
somebody, no matter what it is.
