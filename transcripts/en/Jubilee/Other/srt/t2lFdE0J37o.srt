1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,090
So those would be sharp

2
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,130
minutes.

3
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:22,970
So where are we going to do,
we're going to pair you with an artist,

4
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:25,570
artists that you've never met
and never seen him before,

5
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:30,870
but in artists that typically people
wouldn't associated with your freedom and

6
00:00:31,661 --> 00:00:32,680
y'all are going to make
something together.

7
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:35,330
How are you feeling right now on
your emotional climate for it?

8
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:38,440
Anxious. Excited. Oh Man.

9
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,020
Where are you to do something really cool?

10
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:47,803
Great.

11
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:59,040
Hello? Hello. How's it going? Sorry,

12
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,120
I'm Jessica. Nice to meet
you. Nice to meet you. Okay.

13
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:07,640
Oh,
is it a violin?

14
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:11,690
I was completely surprised
when d sharp walks in.

15
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:16,960
I definitely automatically assumed that
it was going to be me with a dancer.

16
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:19,890
Yeah. And I do a lot of
like electronic music. Yeah.

17
00:01:19,891 --> 00:01:23,420
It's just like pop in things that you
wouldn't normally expect to see with a

18
00:01:23,421 --> 00:01:27,400
classical instrument. Okay,
cool. I actually had no idea.

19
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:29,590
I kind of had a feeling that it
wasn't going to be a musician,

20
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:34,220
but a pleasant surprise.
Okay. So all right. Well

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,230
yeah, no. So

22
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,390
we need to make something.

23
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,560
What made you like one of the,

24
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:58,390
what's it like kind of
one of those things?

25
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:03,140
No, it's like I say, well studied dance
in a college setting and I was like,

26
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,190
I want to do something like really like
Raunchy and out of the box and like I

27
00:02:07,191 --> 00:02:10,520
don't want anyone to know about it.
And then I went to class and my teacher,

28
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:14,300
she was like doing all this beautiful
stuff in the air and I was like,

29
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:18,530
she looks like a ballerina. As soon as
my first day was over I was like, why is,

30
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:21,230
why are no dancers doing pole?

31
00:02:21,231 --> 00:02:23,990
Because it's looked down
upon as like a sexual erotic.

32
00:02:23,991 --> 00:02:25,850
I mean that's why I took class.
I was the appeal for me.

33
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,340
Then when I showed up and saw
how beautiful it was, I was like,

34
00:02:28,341 --> 00:02:30,290
this is exactly what I do is just,
yeah,

35
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,240
different form.

36
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,890
So interesting because I feel like
I kind of had a similar path like,

37
00:02:35,891 --> 00:02:38,410
because you know,
starting with classical music,

38
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:41,650
I was going to always at rebel kids who
like I wasn't wanting to learn like the

39
00:02:41,651 --> 00:02:43,030
songs off the radio.

40
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,110
Yeah. We're the Weirdos, pretty
much doing stuff. We're like,

41
00:02:47,111 --> 00:02:48,460
why can't you do this?
Right.

42
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:52,150
If I think like laying down and
playing would be cool. Like,

43
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:55,730
and then like maybe if
you're walking through, um,

44
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:57,010
okay,

45
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,370
this is hard move if towards the beginning

46
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:01,203
of his life,

47
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:05,680
even a struggle between maybe it doesn't
really work out really beautifully at

48
00:03:05,681 --> 00:03:10,240
first. Yeah. And then we kind
of have, we both have a similar,

49
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:11,800
we'll go down with similar message

50
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,413
photo.

51
00:03:58,570 --> 00:03:59,230
Okay.

52
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:00,370
So this is just what it sounds like

53
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,320
great.
Today.

54
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:14,320
Like getting to play with d sharp is like
I love classical elements and the way

55
00:04:15,981 --> 00:04:19,310
he brings it into a more modern feel.

56
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:21,440
This is like my jam.

57
00:04:21,441 --> 00:04:25,550
Like I love hearing those ideas
taken into like this new way.

58
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:32,773
Okay.

59
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:35,990
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Okay.

60
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,960
I think it's really fascinating
how we have so much in common,

61
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:43,020
but even though we come from
completely different worlds,

62
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,850
our battle has still been
somewhat similar. Like
getting to where we are today.

63
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:52,840
I have not met anybody that's so like
me and so different than me at the same

64
00:04:52,841 --> 00:04:57,220
time. So I feel like we
get along perfectly because
we're very strong and what we

65
00:04:57,221 --> 00:05:00,370
liked, but we also are very
open to each other's ideas.

66
00:05:00,371 --> 00:05:02,380
So it was cool to collaborate.

67
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:09,820
Overall, I think it's going to be
good, but I don't know. We'll see.

68
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:14,260
I'm definitely nervous,
but, um, I'm excited and I'm
happy for this opportunity,

69
00:05:14,261 --> 00:05:16,610
so I'm excited to do it.
Yeah.

70
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,013
Rolling.

71
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,053
Oh,

72
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:51,440
