1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:01,700
Oh

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:05,920
know I heard a lot about Jose's story,
which reminds me a lot in my story.

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:09,670
I just want to be an encouragement to him
today. I get to know him a little bit.

4
00:00:09,671 --> 00:00:11,440
Spent some time with him.
Hang out.

5
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,530
Yeah,
it seems

6
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,300
[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

7
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:35,773
it was cover.

8
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,073
I love her.

9
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:50,840
How was 13 when I had my first drink,
it was at a party.

10
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:57,070
I was always a shy kid and it gave
me the courage to actually, you know,

11
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,033
talk to girls.

12
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:01,970
I liked that confidence and so I
wanted him more of it and more of it.

13
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,880
That's when I started
getting hooked on to it.

14
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,700
When I think about him, I get emotional
because right outside his door,

15
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:16,350
homelessness,
drugs in his face offer to him.

16
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:22,190
They see him on the corner.
I've seen him, you know,

17
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:24,530
make the wrong choices.

18
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:38,050
December 8th,
2010 it started off as a normal day.

19
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,710
You went to a party. We brought
alcohol. They brought, we'd never had,

20
00:01:42,711 --> 00:01:44,140
I've mixed drugs with alcohol,

21
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:49,190
but at the moment like I didn't care
when got drunk, I'm not spelled.

22
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:55,110
And when the party ended,
I remember walking outside.

23
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,560
As soon as I opened the door,
everything slowed down.

24
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,280
Every time I close my eyes,
I saw a bright light.

25
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,040
I was slowly given into it.

26
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:17,120
The paramedics rushed then.

27
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:20,983
Okay.

28
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,770
And I saw my mom for the first time.

29
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,330
It seemed as if she saw her son dead.

30
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:34,330
Well,
my heart just pretty much shut to pieces.

31
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,410
So he's framing 40 [inaudible] not always

32
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:48,540
you on business. Tell me more or less the,

33
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:53,320
is it too narrow? They knew
me. Smile. Okay. Synthetic

34
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,010
from my action,
I

35
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,240
could have lost everything.

36
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:05,610
Oh my mom must be important.

37
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:14,070
Right. There was when it hit me
that I was going the wrong way.

38
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:24,620
So I knew it was a, for nine years
now as a teacher and a coach,

39
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,310
all hate dot. Bob was,
basketball is stuck in my life.

40
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:32,530
Every time I stepped on the court,
like my mind would just go blank now.

41
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:36,890
Just focus on what was ahead of me,
drinking or smoking or whatever it was.

42
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:42,130
I didn't need all that. I just
needed a ball and a hoop anyway.

43
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:54,940
And you know, I went, in many cases
I would consider myself an underdog.

44
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:59,840
I'm not a big guy. I don't bring
a big presence to the court sound.

45
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:02,060
My Room wasn't an MBA. The people, they,

46
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:04,790
when you take the first class that
you don't expect much from them,

47
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,500
such as of German land

48
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,030
to become the first one of the
first class to come from Palo Alto.

49
00:04:11,031 --> 00:04:14,570
Like what did it take for him to actually
overcome all the obstacles that he

50
00:04:14,571 --> 00:04:15,404
went through?

51
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:22,240
Yeah. When things are rough, I
like Romans five, three to five.

52
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:27,390
It's about
how through your suffering,

53
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,200
like the end goal is joy.
Yeah.

54
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,620
I was ready to quit many times.

55
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:38,020
The toughest obstacle was probably finding
someone that would give me a chance

56
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,400
and uh,

57
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:43,780
and there are people who
had to call me and be like,

58
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,170
you're going to show up tomorrow
and you're going to go to practice.

59
00:04:47,171 --> 00:04:48,004
You're not going to quit.

60
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,073
Yeah,

61
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,220
no.
I heard a lot about Jose's story.

62
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,880
I just want to be an encouragement to him
today. I get to know him a little bit,

63
00:05:04,881 --> 00:05:06,650
spend some time with him,
hang out.

64
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,340
He's down there.

65
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:21,990
He thinks he's just doing drills for
the camera and it's all going to try to

66
00:05:21,991 --> 00:05:24,420
surprise him. Yeah, we'll see how it goes.

67
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:34,730
What was it

68
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:40,530
like trying not to jump around and,
you know, seemed like a little kid,

69
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:44,580
but I wanted to, but you nationally
to keep my cool. It's hard

70
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:50,250
to take in right now. I was
not expecting this, you know,

71
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:53,340
seeing you play and then now
I get to meet you in person.

72
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,970
If it's mind blowing.
We're all

73
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,340
in. You got to pay. You want to
Oh, oh, play me one on one? Yeah.

74
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:07,610
Okay. You going to get
right to it then, Huh? Yeah,

75
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,220
because he's been through
what he's been through.

76
00:06:10,221 --> 00:06:13,400
He has a solid foundation and understands

77
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:16,860
a lot more than a typical
18 year old night.

78
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,200
You can hear it in his voice so you can
see it. You can see it in his smile.

79
00:06:21,201 --> 00:06:23,690
And he talks a lot about, um, his joy.

80
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,590
The neat thing about it is if he
didn't go through, you know, the,

81
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,230
the addiction and, and, and
the drugs and the alcohol,

82
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:34,580
I think his perception or understanding
of joy would be different.

83
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:36,480
Okay.

84
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:40,950
I've caused my parents so much pain
and I caused myself a lot of pain.

85
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:44,220
I had to suffer, but you know,
I still have faith in God.

86
00:06:44,221 --> 00:06:49,221
I still pray every night before I go
to bed because that night I could have

87
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,750
easily gone round over in the streets,

88
00:06:51,751 --> 00:06:55,020
but someone was looking over
me that night, you know,

89
00:06:56,470 --> 00:07:01,240
you know, suffering, um, can look like
a lot of different things, but uh,

90
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,170
everything always happens for a reason.

91
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:05,860
Okay.

92
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:10,150
I still get haunted by that day. You
know, I can still hear my mom cry,

93
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:16,870
but that motivates me to keep going and
finishing strong and going to college

94
00:07:16,871 --> 00:07:17,740
and making them proud

95
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:24,480
just seem pretty similar. The two sales
look, assess it is not who you are. Yes.

96
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:25,583
Yep.

97
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,670
Hey,
thanks all for checking out Jose Story.

98
00:07:46,671 --> 00:07:50,540
Really appreciate Jeremy Lin for
coming out and thanks to Julie Project.

99
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:53,450
You know, they're doing a great job
of telling the story at all you guys.

100
00:07:53,451 --> 00:07:54,620
So hopefully you guys check it out.

101
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:57,990
Okay.
