1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,370
Just one wild day.
Ooh Bro.

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:06,210
Cause you hit me with your
car and I didn't even want
I hit this man with my car.

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:11,270
I'm sorry. Pause everything. What's
up y'all okay? You always interrupted.

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:14,370
Yeah, I'm as a writer. This is John and
we've been a place in candy confession.

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,830
Oh yes. It's about to get real. You're
a little bit too close to my crotch.

6
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:31,950
Oh, hey bro. Hey Dude. I feel
like I'm in time out right now.

7
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:37,620
Isn't minutes I looked right.
How do you get to know each other?

8
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:43,110
We came out the same womb. That was
a lie. That's a lie. We came out,

9
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:48,230
I came up the womb of the sister-in-law
of his mother were cousins.

10
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,280
Yeah,
that was a very complicated

11
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,660
uh, yes or no. Pineapple is good on pizza.

12
00:00:57,661 --> 00:01:01,440
I promise you if you kill you dog by now,

13
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:05,130
I don't understand why you
have trust issues like that.

14
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,880
You probably eat kit kats like without
breaking them apart. First of all,

15
00:01:08,881 --> 00:01:12,450
I don't eat cake cats. I got Kevin,
he son Miss me with that Nigga.

16
00:01:12,451 --> 00:01:17,010
He just had a rice crispy at Starbucks
on the right side of my mouth. But look,

17
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:20,970
this is what I'm trying to say.
Hmm. Pineapples is a fruit.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,920
You Eat Cherries on your pizza? No.
Apple. Nah. Huh? How about water Malone?

19
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:30,370
If pizza sauce had all of
those, I would try it. It's
like a fruit pizza, right? Oh,

20
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,880
let me change your color for you.
You're doing the wrong thing. Oh Bro.

21
00:01:32,881 --> 00:01:37,660
That's some pretty color though.
When you just like time, you feel me?

22
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:42,000
Like pineapple on my pizza, but I don't
want him to not be my friend no more.

23
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:46,520
So let me hit the,
never have I ever Friday while laugh,

24
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:51,900
Bro. Hey, what was in it right now?

25
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,590
You're just like,

26
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:01,950
cause I like, oh

27
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:08,600
hey. She says something. Oh Man.
I was like, hey. She was like,

28
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:13,470
Hey. And I was like, oh my God.

29
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:15,610
You laugh louder, right?
Yeah. It was like,

30
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,610
oh wait. Yes, Bro.

31
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,830
Oh Man, man, that was,

32
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:31,050
I just feel like farts has god gifts
God's gift saying like, Hey, it's okay.

33
00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:32,190
I'm funny and power.

34
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:40,110
Never have I ever questioned
if I'll ever make it. Dude,

35
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,510
I was walking across the street
this morning. I was like,

36
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,130
I don't know if I got what it takes.

37
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:52,800
So yes, if I've questioned it,
no, I have not questioned it.

38
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,830
I'm going make it.
Wait,

39
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:01,240
I'm lying. You know what I'm
saying? I have, I've questioned it,

40
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:05,140
but cause it's hard, bro. It's a
lot of talented people in the world.

41
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,680
A lot of funny people. A
lot of cute. Yeah. People.

42
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:12,020
I'm not even the most talented and
I'm pretty ugly. But the thing is,

43
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:17,180
I think that like,
I think for the most part I got nothing.

44
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:20,120
I just really think I really, honestly,
you shouldn't beat yourself up about that,

45
00:03:20,121 --> 00:03:24,830
bro, about being ugly or
being knocked down and you,
because you're both, no, I am.

46
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:28,880
I'm take courage.
You

47
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:35,180
pick up
yes or no.

48
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:37,160
I could beat you in a
street fight. Come on, Bro.

49
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:40,850
You don't want this dude
would win every fight we have.

50
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:45,950
I would win every fight. That's not
true. Look, it's about the heart.

51
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,580
You know what I'm saying? Now somebody's
saying no, it's about the fight, right?

52
00:03:49,581 --> 00:03:50,960
Yeah,
but it's not,

53
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:54,890
I got hard you remembering that dumb
and dumber where he just reached in and

54
00:03:54,891 --> 00:03:58,180
took homeboys heart. Oh, oh,

55
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:02,410
ever seeing King Kong? Nah. Yes, of
course. I started getting it bro.

56
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:07,070
You remember the part where my gene had
the dinosaur's mouth and he made his

57
00:04:07,071 --> 00:04:11,240
mouth go like that.
That's not what I would do to you know,

58
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:14,090
but I thought I'd bring that up cause
I really liked that movie scene.

59
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,730
However it was for you would
lose that hands facing site.

60
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:19,190
We will let me catch you in the streets.

61
00:04:19,191 --> 00:04:21,340
Just come in dressed
superman dude and I'm God

62
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:29,270
God, forgive me for that one. Never
have I ever divide my parents.

63
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:37,640
I think maybe both of us kind of like
deciding to follow our actual purpose and

64
00:04:37,641 --> 00:04:42,110
not listen to our parents and everybody
else that was speaking logically to us.

65
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:46,430
Like to wake up and say for him to
be like, Yo, I want to be a rapper.

66
00:04:46,431 --> 00:04:49,730
I wanted to pursue music full time. Or
for me to just wake up and be like, oh,

67
00:04:49,731 --> 00:04:51,080
I want to be a youtuber full time.

68
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,030
I want to have businesses and
I want to be like an actor.

69
00:04:53,031 --> 00:04:56,360
I want to be famous one day parents
don't see that and that doesn't make,

70
00:04:56,361 --> 00:04:58,940
that doesn't make sense cause then
it's just like, it's not their fault,

71
00:04:58,941 --> 00:05:00,350
it's just that they were
born in a different time.

72
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:03,620
I think a lot of parents don't realize
that we're born in a totally different

73
00:05:03,621 --> 00:05:07,160
generation and all this stuff is possible
through like social media and stuff

74
00:05:07,161 --> 00:05:07,994
like that.
You know,

75
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:13,450
I woke up yesterday and found my
face on the front of Apple Music,

76
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,660
one of the genres. I was like,
Oh snap, my face is right there.

77
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,590
You know what I'm saying? And it
brings you back to this. It's like, oh,

78
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:26,880
we can either aid the logical go to
school just like everybody else because

79
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:31,330
apparently it's like one in a
million people that makes this,

80
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,950
you know what I'm saying? That is able
to do this. But that's only half true.

81
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:41,280
If you put 100% in and you have people
that support you and let's be honest,

82
00:05:41,621 --> 00:05:44,260
if you're, you're good at it, you're
talented at what you're doing,

83
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:49,710
then there's no reason for you to not
succeed unless you just do something

84
00:05:50,621 --> 00:05:55,560
stupid. Yes sir. No, I'm done in
freestyle rap for you right now.

85
00:05:56,670 --> 00:06:01,150
Don't ever let go even mean beat. All
right, let's get table. Yeah, it was,

86
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:08,990
yeah. Yeah. Okay. Josh, he did.
As a writer sitting at the table,

87
00:06:08,991 --> 00:06:10,880
we're only talking about
the stories and you know,

88
00:06:10,881 --> 00:06:13,430
it ain't no fables then his freestyle,
they just Duke and you know,

89
00:06:13,431 --> 00:06:16,040
I can't remember at the time
I get on this, you know,

90
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,530
I'll be delighted to rec pool,

91
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,480
but I've got that green going to
get what you don't think. Glean.

92
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:25,130
I don't drink no name. What's
your, no, I'm leaving and you know,

93
00:06:25,131 --> 00:06:28,850
funny and I've got the money,
but I don't get fine. Red Light,

94
00:06:28,851 --> 00:06:32,030
green light and try to get them me.
But if I hit this Nigga yet,

95
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:35,820
it's going to be cleaned by, not a fair
fight, but I'm going to do it right. Yeah.

96
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,700
He said he gone take me like King Kong
but that ain't buys. Huh? Okay. Oh my bad.

97
00:06:40,701 --> 00:06:43,310
You want it to keep in mind that I
thought I had more cause that was low key

98
00:06:43,311 --> 00:06:45,060
whack to me and I wasn't
pleased with that.

99
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,390
They have are on days
and we have our off days.

100
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:56,210
And you going to say this was a on one
but yeah. Yours was low key clean though.

101
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:02,330
Never hired. Never have I ever
imagined. Yeah, we both came read

102
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,520
you that kid that nobody wants to be
called out. Like when they play popcorn,

103
00:07:08,521 --> 00:07:11,540
the class, they never say
your name. Never have I ever

104
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:17,840
there, have I ever imagined
beating up a complete stranger?

105
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,780
I had a beat up a complete
stranger. No, I'm just kidding.

106
00:07:20,781 --> 00:07:24,320
I got beat up by a complete stranger.
It's definitely cause I wasn't there.

107
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,610
That ain't that literally actually the
real reason bro. Come on. I got you bro.

108
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:33,470
Also, you would lose that
fight that we Nah. Ah, okay.

109
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:38,360
Well let me, the one thing that would
just make you say, that's enough.

110
00:07:38,361 --> 00:07:41,050
We got to throw hands.
Ooh.

111
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:46,350
Honestly we throw hands on.
Yeah, but like real, real life.

112
00:07:46,351 --> 00:07:51,120
Just like, look man, I'm like Loki
Authority type of stuff. Oh Bro. Okay.

113
00:07:51,121 --> 00:07:55,080
First of all, I mean by you
looking I'm door, let's get
that out. But that's crazy.

114
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,860
But um, okay. Um, let me see.

115
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:03,280
I feel like I'm a very
level headed person.

116
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:08,710
Very whatever you do would have to be
repeated multiple times or like talk to be

117
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:13,510
wild. Okay. Just one thing I'm
saying just one wild day Bro.

118
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:17,330
Cause you hit me with your car and not
anything. I hate this man with my car.

119
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,450
I'm sorry. Pause everything.
How's everything?

120
00:08:20,451 --> 00:08:23,570
I forgot I hit this barrier
with my cars on a snapchat too.

121
00:08:23,571 --> 00:08:25,340
Like I was doing in
snapchat. He's like, Yo,

122
00:08:25,341 --> 00:08:28,130
Mickey looked like you hit me with
your car cause I won't let them leave.

123
00:08:28,131 --> 00:08:30,440
Look at Jackie van over here. He talking
about he gonna give you what you like,

124
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:31,460
who you go. Yeah, we get here.

125
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:36,320
I laid out in the backseat and we went
to the mall right now. I was like, Bruh,

126
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:41,210
I'm going die. He said my best
friend hit me with his car.

127
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:47,090
I was like, sorry, what up
guys? It's your boy Jason.

128
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,930
It's your boy, and thank you so
much for watching that video.

129

We love you and we're so
grateful. Yes, indeed.
