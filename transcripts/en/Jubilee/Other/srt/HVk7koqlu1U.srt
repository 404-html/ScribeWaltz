1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,200
I'm Alexa. Nice to meet you. Just
like animals. I get that so often.

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:07,740
Alexa? Yeah, like Amazon or you got it.

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,380
I'm just glad it's like that
thing I can be like, Yo Alexa,

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:11,343
maybe this song.

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,740
Yeah,
I'm nervous if I'm being honest.

6
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,800
Do you feel like you'll know the person
even if you can't see them today?

7
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,430
I feel like I will.
Yes.

8
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:35,520
I'm pretty good about picking
up inflections of like
voices and everything and I

9
00:00:35,771 --> 00:00:38,500
can tell somebody who's being honest
with me or not by their voice,

10
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:40,210
so I feel like I'll do
really well with that.

11
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:48,540
Everyone who's not sitting play some
music. Kind of do your own thing.

12
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:56,530
Hi.

13
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:01,360
Hello. What's your name? I'm going
to go. What's your name? I'm Alexa.

14
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:05,230
Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. That's
a really cute name though. Oh, thank you.

15
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:10,390
How old are you? I'm 18 how
old are you? I'm 23 okay.

16
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,330
Do you have any goals in the future?

17
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,540
Ah, yes. One of my biggest
goals right now as to uh,

18
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:17,500
be able to have enough money to buy my mom

19
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:22,340
her own house. I would love that. My
name is Alexa. Oh, it was my mom's name.

20
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:26,090
Really? No, not really.
Oh, are you in school? Yes,

21
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:30,680
I'm studying to either be
a marine biologist or a
psychologist. Where do you go?

22
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,370
Oh, I go to bio lab. It's
a Christian college. That's
cool. So you're a Christian?

23
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:38,300
Yes, very much so. Or just a
little bit. Ah, very much so.

24
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:40,670
So are you like working or are you going
to school or something like that? I'm,

25
00:01:40,671 --> 00:01:43,710
I'm working on getting
work. Yeah, I'm broke.

26
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,910
So tell me a little about yourself.
What do you, what do you do right now?

27
00:01:46,911 --> 00:01:51,650
I'm a full time student. Okay. I
love all of the arts. So painting,

28
00:01:51,651 --> 00:01:53,900
photography, stuff like
that. How about you?

29
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:57,570
I uh, I'm actually really into
airplanes. Um, I'd say photography.

30
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:00,060
I do a little bit of camera
shoots and stuff like that.

31
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:03,710
So I guess we have something in common.
There was good.

32
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:04,723
Hi,

33
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,070
my name is Tyler. I'm going to
ask you a question really quick.

34
00:02:07,071 --> 00:02:09,140
This is really important.
If we went to yogurt land,

35
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,150
would you put chocolate
on new yogurt or fruit?

36
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:14,720
Cause that's like really important
to me. I felt both. Okay.

37
00:02:14,721 --> 00:02:19,620
You're already a freak. I can tell. This
is crazy. How are you? Um, awesome. Yeah,

38
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,160
I can tell your voice. You sound
like really energetic. Yeah.

39
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,210
Yeah.
I'm super outgoing and everything.

40
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:30,040
Oh goodness gracious.

41
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:32,913
Yeah.

42
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:37,540
I'm going to have to get rid of JV because
I just didn't feel like a connection

43
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:39,070
there with the one after.

44
00:02:39,071 --> 00:02:42,670
Caleb also just didn't really feel
like a straight connection there.

45
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:56,380
I'd say my ideal date would be,
I don't want to be too cliche,

46
00:02:56,381 --> 00:02:57,820
but long walks on the beach.

47
00:02:57,821 --> 00:03:02,510
But also I always wanted to go on a Ferris
wheel with one beautiful girl. Okay.

48
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:07,180
Mine would be probably driving
around and Pauli and up on the beach.

49
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,340
Pretend to know about
constellations and stuff.

50
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,700
So I'm going to tell you straight
off the bat like I suck at planning.

51
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:18,050
Do you know like those
retro like diamonds? Yes.

52
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,490
Like with the colors and
the lights and stuff.

53
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:22,850
I think that'd be a really good
location. Cute. Okay. All right. So,

54
00:03:22,851 --> 00:03:24,680
so bear with me half,
but a lot of thought into this.

55
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,790
So I'm working on getting my pilot's
license. I'm thinking you and me, we go,

56
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:32,360
we go, we hop into a little private
plane at the airport. Right? We take it,

57
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:35,150
we fly up the coast of
California and you know,

58
00:03:35,151 --> 00:03:36,620
there's little islands off the coast,
right?

59
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,930
We could go and kind of fly over
to one of the little islands.

60
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:41,870
Obviously you're into photography. You
bring your camera and get some nice shots.

61
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,320
We definitely need to share memes with
each other because my main game is crazy.

62
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,170
So like if you don't have good
tastes in means we can't be a thing.

63
00:03:48,171 --> 00:03:51,350
Like this is not going to work. Oh
trust me, I have an entire folder.

64
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,100
Might have to go buy a ring or
something. I don't know. Laughter.

65
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,810
I think laughter is really,
really cool.

66
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:00,490
I like to do like impressions and stuff
like that. So uh, like black pants.

67
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,750
Oh my gosh,
what is your name?

68
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:09,640
All right. So, um, I'm going to have
to get rid of, let's see, Miguel,

69
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,910
initially I felt kind of a connection,
but after that I just kind of,

70
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:16,660
it kind of went away a little bit.
And then whoever the third person was,

71
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,630
and it's because initially he just
immediately said he was bad at planning.

72
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,130
And I like someone who's really good at
planning and stuff like that because I

73
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:26,680
love being creative and
all that kind of stuff. So

74
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,330
I think for me personally,
if someone's not vocal,

75
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:40,310
if you're on a date or
whatever, explaining who you
really are, how you feel.

76
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:45,000
It goes. Very foreign in a relationship.
I would say most of the time Christian,

77
00:04:45,001 --> 00:04:48,270
like, you know, excessive
drinking or like smoking,

78
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:52,110
like a little bit's fine, but
like if it's excess, yeah,

79
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,480
a little bit hard to smoking
and drinking thing, you know?

80
00:04:54,481 --> 00:04:58,740
I wouldn't want to date someone who's,
he's a partier, you know, every weekend.

81
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:02,770
That's just not really my scene.
What's Gucci man?

82
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:07,310
I feel like I need someone who can like
twerk, you know? Like that's what I want.

83
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,930
I want.
So even if you can't do it that well,

84
00:05:08,931 --> 00:05:10,610
I want you to try it on
someone who can have fun.

85
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:15,170
I want to continue from where we last off.
What would you say is like a,

86
00:05:15,171 --> 00:05:16,610
a really big talent of yours?

87
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,080
I guess I can sing, but like I'm
not very confident with it. Okay.

88
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:26,070
I mean, I'm not like horrible, but I
don't really been public about it I guess.

89
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,593
Look you up.

90
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:36,830
Um, okay. First one's
going to have to be Tyler.

91
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,450
He was talking about
twerking and everything.

92
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,760
I haven't tried it so I
don't know if I can do it,

93
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,660
but he also didn't seem like he was
very serious about our relationship.

94
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:49,520
And then I'm going to have to,
uh, Caleb, no particular reason.

95
00:05:49,521 --> 00:05:52,580
Just wasn't really feeling it anymore.
I guess

96
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:00,790
I want to be able to say
that I can own a house,

97
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:04,080
but hopefully by the time I'm
30, you know, have my family set.

98
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:08,740
How many kids do you want? Hopefully
by like a boy and a girl to be honest.

99
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:12,220
And then maybe like three or four dogs.
So yeah,

100
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,560
I'm very slowly with that. Oh, nice.

101
00:06:14,561 --> 00:06:17,470
And I want the boy to be a
little older than the girl. See,

102
00:06:17,471 --> 00:06:21,820
I want it the other way around so the
girl can believe the boring for me.

103
00:06:21,821 --> 00:06:24,830
Something that's really important.
I'm trying to become a pilot and I,

104
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:28,030
I've joined the navy to try and achieve
that goal and I'm still working there.

105
00:06:28,031 --> 00:06:29,830
And that's something I
feel like for my partner,

106
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,410
I want them to be the same
mentality that I'm in.

107
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:35,620
You can't be in a relationship with
one person is motivated. Right.

108
00:06:35,621 --> 00:06:38,170
And the other person is, it doesn't
really care. I've got a lot,

109
00:06:38,171 --> 00:06:40,150
so I'm a musician actor,

110
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,950
but I'm also studying political science
and I want to be president of the United

111
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,990
States. So obviously, um, you know,

112
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:50,680
being with somebody that's like committed
but also like supportive and I can

113
00:06:50,681 --> 00:06:55,420
learn a lot from them, um, that, that
really means a lot to me. What about you?

114
00:06:55,820 --> 00:07:00,220
I'm leaning towards psychologists so I
can help teens with mental disorders and

115
00:07:00,221 --> 00:07:02,470
everything like that.
There's a lot of, I think,

116
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:06,540
genuine connection and you really
like care about people, you know,

117
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:10,750
because then you can look beyond where
they are and like see them for who they

118
00:07:10,751 --> 00:07:13,150
truly can be. And I think
that's super special. Yeah,

119
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,470
I'm kidding one.
Okay.

120
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,850
Um,
I'm just going to have to cut off Sam.

121
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:29,060
The vibe that I'm getting just isn't as
strong as the other two that I've been

122
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:29,923
getting.

123
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:36,383
Okay.

124
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:39,220
So no prompt here.
So I want to know a little bit about you.

125
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,330
Tell me about yourself. What
are your hobbies? I like to
dance. Um, wait, wait, wait,

126
00:07:43,331 --> 00:07:44,650
stop there. Stop there. Dance.

127
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:49,420
Are we talking like salsa or break dance
in here because I'm okay with both.

128
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,920
More so hip hop than anything. Okay,
that's cool. What else do you like?

129
00:07:53,921 --> 00:07:58,070
So you like dance, you like to sing? I
was thinking on my way here to every song.

130
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:01,390
That's awesome. That's cool.
But what about photography?

131
00:08:01,391 --> 00:08:05,710
I'm kind of curious about that. Do you
like portraits? Landscapes? My main focus,

132
00:08:05,711 --> 00:08:09,700
I guess you could say his portrait.
Um, I love shooting animals as well.

133
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,230
Like wildlife. Yeah. You love
taking a photo on me though.

134
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:18,460
So what's the hardest thing that you've
ever been through and how did you get

135
00:08:18,461 --> 00:08:22,000
through it and how did it affect
who you are uniquely today?

136
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:27,660
One of the hardest things I've had to
go through was probably middle school.

137
00:08:28,601 --> 00:08:33,601
Beginning of high school
because I struggled with a
lot of depression and self

138
00:08:34,241 --> 00:08:38,890
confidence. Um, I've overcame it by
like, I'm starting to love myself,

139
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:43,750
I'm super outgoing and I help people.
So helping people helps me. Yeah. Yeah.

140
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:44,910
That's amazing.

141
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:48,400
Why would definitely say like you have
to embrace who you are because it's

142
00:08:48,401 --> 00:08:52,810
unique and what you bring to the world
is different than any other person in the

143
00:08:52,811 --> 00:08:56,040
other individual. And it makes
you, you are today, you know?

144
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,293
Yeah,
yeah.

145
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,970
I think I have a decision.
All right,

146
00:09:09,971 --> 00:09:13,990
so I'm going to have to go with Joseph.

147
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:15,850
That last question that he asked me.

148
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:20,770
It shows me that he can actually get
really deep when he needs to be and that's

149
00:09:20,771 --> 00:09:22,270
the kind of stuff that I'm looking for.

150
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:24,460
Like I want someone who I
can have a ton of fun with,

151
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:28,210
but I can also be super serious
with when the time comes.

152
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:33,040
So that kind of set it over the bar
and that's what I'm looking for. So

153
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,590
thank
you.

154
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,970
I'm definitely more used to like talking
to people like face to face and being

155
00:09:47,971 --> 00:09:52,950
more real. So, so a weird
in a nutshell. Yeah.

156
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:53,920
As we,
this is all about

157
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:03,750
Yo. Nice. Nice to meet you. How are you?

158
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:06,530
I'm good. How are you
doing well, I'm doing well.

159
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:11,240
I didn't really envision you looking like
anything but I'm really happy or cute.

160
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:15,740
Thank you. Thank you. Yeah,

161
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:18,380
I know this kind of go somewhere I guess.

162
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:20,610
Well I got a girl.

163
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:22,483
What?

164
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:31,210
I'm really good. You're awesome though.
Like did this just happen? Dang. Okay

165
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:41,520
girlfriend. I do. Do I just show up?
I'm the only one that doesn't go here.

166
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:46,140
Why are you guys here? As for
single people? Yeah. Oh Dad.

167
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:48,920
I told my girlfriend like all about it
and everything and she said it sounds

168
00:10:48,921 --> 00:10:49,754
like a cool,

169
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:54,543
oh cool.

170
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,120
Okay.

171
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,970
I thought it was like a prank
on me. I was like okay, like,

172
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:08,530
and then everyone else was as surprised
as me and I was like guest not,

173
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:14,430
that is weird cause I totally went into
this thinking that I was going to end up

174
00:11:14,801 --> 00:11:17,320
with somebody who is
single and like looking,

175
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:19,780
but I mean I'm not hurt or anything.

176
00:11:19,781 --> 00:11:24,280
I'm just kinda confused as to
why he was here. But I mean,

177
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:29,740
it's whatever. I'm happy he
has a girlfriend, I guess,

178
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,220
cause he's,

179
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:34,150
he's actually a genuinely like really
cool person and he had everything that I

180
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:37,780
was looking for, so he must've had
everything that she was looking for.

181
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,300
So I hope that they're
happy and everything.

182
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:41,370
Yeah.
