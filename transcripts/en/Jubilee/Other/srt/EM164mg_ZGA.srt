1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,900
What part are you in the music and
beat boxing. Can we hear something?

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,013
You want to try it?

3
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:13,010
This is hard.
Oh

4
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:26,780
wait, no. Uh, no. Do you?

5
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:32,000
Oh Man. I was just told like I'm going
to beat box with some producer. Okay.

6
00:00:32,001 --> 00:00:34,830
I mean I just assume we're going
to make something. My name's Pete.

7
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:40,070
I'm a beat boxer. I go by Jay Luna
and I'm a producer, singer songwriter.

8
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,250
I just didn't know what to

9
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,350
expect,
you know,

10
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:55,460
like just walk in and I heard
that it's a music producer.

11
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:57,110
I have never worked with like a beat box.

12
00:00:57,111 --> 00:01:01,400
I usually just sounds around me or just
like other like producers and stuff.

13
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,610
Okay. So you said you're
a beatboxer, right? Yeah.

14
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:07,070
That's a crazy sound you can make.
Do

15
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:13,700
what the
birds flying

16
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,110
beatboxing is making
rhythm with your mouth.

17
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:24,260
Right. And then you have like the
special effects, you know, like Whoa,

18
00:01:24,261 --> 00:01:25,094
like what is that?

19
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:28,360
Definitely want to utilize all the
weird different sounds you can make.

20
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:31,360
And it's like really nice being a guy
who like dedicated pretty much the whole

21
00:01:31,361 --> 00:01:32,750
life to like rhythm, you know? So

22
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,200
let's tous with one of your songs.
No, no, no. I'm embarrassed.

23
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,700
I showed you might beat box. I
guess I will. I guess I will.

24
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,240
I think his voice is Great.

25
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,010
It's more like a mellow kind of like wave.

26
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:04,520
Okay. I think we're all
set. Hey man, that was sick.

27
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:09,320
Oh, I see. Yeah, I think it'd be cool
for you. Like maybe record you first.

28
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,120
I think kind of play off that.

29
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:11,791
All right.

30
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:16,380
Like just put down some rhythms like
go through five or six like slow fast.

31
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,070
Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Do you want
to do like a crazy role

32
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,270
that's not even humanly possible?

33
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,320
Let's compress the Shah.
Let's go.

34
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,640
He was definitely interesting to see how
he like reversed on the sound stretch.

35
00:02:46,641 --> 00:02:49,860
Some sounds. Is that laser
sound for sure. Oh yeah.

36
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:57,150
Hello? Do you want to
hear a record? Some stuff?

37
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,333
Yeah,
sure.

38
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:16,470
How's it just all comes out like garbage.
I'm just kidding.

39
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,670
Hey,

40
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:38,960
nice to meet you. Nice to
meet you. So I'm from Nigeria.

41
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:41,810
I'm from Delta State in Nigeria.
I'm from Nigeria.

42
00:03:41,811 --> 00:03:45,240
I'm from a non birthdays
ebook win. Hey. Hey.

43
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:48,470
Never made anything for like dancers.

44
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,980
I would like them to enjoy themselves
and feel comfortable dancing with them.

45
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:55,910
When I saw Jane, right? No, I was
like, what are these guys took up?

46
00:03:55,911 --> 00:03:58,740
I don't know if they like
make African beats and stuff.

47
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,610
So I guess for like dancing to
whatever you guys come up with. Yeah,

48
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,350
I think that's, I think that's what
it is. That makes most sense to me.

49
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:09,410
So what part are you in the museum
be boxing you beatboxing that's so,

50
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:12,330
can we hear something?
Oh sure.

51
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,030
I can't,
you want to try it?

52
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,210
Is this a bunch of instruments in there?
He has a hole put in Bandon.

53
00:04:28,211 --> 00:04:31,250
They're like, I've never made like a
beat box here before. What do I see?

54
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:34,450
How long have you been producing? Uh, I've
been through this for like three years.

55
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:38,590
Jay seems like an angel and he
just like grease everything. Okay.

56
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:43,810
Yeah,
definitely.

57
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,390
Just trying to figure out

58
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,600
like what kind of dancing do you
guys do or are solid dancing?

59
00:05:02,601 --> 00:05:07,370
It's basically the afrobeats describe
it really fast with like, your health

60
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,120
has a lot of like the group to it.

61
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:16,360
It's more like the beats he get me.

62
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,173
Yeah.

63
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,250
It's not every day you
become a recording artist.

64
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:42,780
I think my favorite part was
probably recording the girls.

65
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:46,410
That's when it kind of felt like they
all kind of came together where like we

66
00:05:46,411 --> 00:05:51,411
all kind of put it into a song and I
think that's the best feeling about

67
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,010
finishing. The whole credit
process felt really organic

68
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:01,780
to the Oakland, to the old
one. And that one man, Dad,

69
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:06,670
the guy like,

70
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:14,660
oh cool means waste the backside
basically I means is there.

71
00:06:15,171 --> 00:06:19,130
So we'll put the homies though the bodies,
they're like the waste of there.

72
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:22,520
That's how you kept the crowd basically.
So yeah, they hear that and it's like,

73
00:06:22,521 --> 00:06:24,950
it's time to dance.
You already know.

74
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:30,130
Well glad I go out of this one stems
more from South Africa and it's like, uh,

75
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:32,780
you've been your legging
and you bring your army.

76
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:37,160
Everything like bring it around
and then the shark or shark who is,

77
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:42,180
it's like you're moving, you're moving
and you can do it fast, do it for,

78
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,780
but didn't you pull your arms into it
and you're just rolling around with it?

79
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:45,703
That's so cool.

80
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:49,730
They were able to fuse our culture
and their cultures and their different

81
00:06:49,731 --> 00:06:53,480
talents together to bring together
a beat that we were able to frank.

82
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:00,410
That's it.

83
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:03,360
I listened to the song and I'm like,
he blocks him to,

84
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:07,140
the ladies are like dancing right
there. Boom. Really sick to watch.

85
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:10,080
I'm definitely excited.
The communication was there.

86
00:07:10,081 --> 00:07:12,450
It wasn't like really
rigid and like boring.

87
00:07:12,451 --> 00:07:14,070
We were able to like
laugh with each other.

88
00:07:14,071 --> 00:07:15,660
They joke with each other
about different things,

89
00:07:15,661 --> 00:07:18,330
so I'm super excited about Lilly.
Me.

90
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,890
Oh, oh yeah. We got to this

91
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,030
amazing copy.
Who?

92
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,250
Five, six, seven, eight

93
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:02,310
come a little closer.
A little closer.

94
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,720
Come a little closer.

95
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:25,383

97
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:50,043
Ooh,

98
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,110
awesome.
