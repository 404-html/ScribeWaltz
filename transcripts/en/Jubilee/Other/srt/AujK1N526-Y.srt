1
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:04,530
People see the end result, which is
a shiny red airplane. And they go,

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,860
well that's nice. You know, like
that's, that's cool. But like,

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:12,180
it's more to me than that's
the reflection. Everything
I had to do to turn that

4
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:35,080
growing up for me was like,
I did have energy,

5
00:00:35,081 --> 00:00:35,914
but I don't have anywhere to put it.

6
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,270
He Sky Surfing,

7
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:00,430
we love you so much.
And he teaches us cleaning.

8
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,490
So like at school, um, I was put
in special Ed. They didn't like,

9
00:01:06,491 --> 00:01:10,330
I just felt like nobody, nobody
believed like I was capable of anything.

10
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:17,200
It was just like being in timeout.
I would just sit there and,

11
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:18,900
okay.

12
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:19,890
Not really do a lot.

13
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,880
When you become like unconfident,
you don't know how to,
how to recover from that.

14
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:30,360
Oh,

15
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:35,300
I don't have a really good way
of being like other people.

16
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:37,130
Oh,

17
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:44,170
I was just bullied enough for teas
to where I thought I am weird.

18
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,490
I was really restless and at this school,
like the institution just does,

19
00:01:48,491 --> 00:01:49,600
it wasn't speaking to me at all.

20
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,390
I really needed to find something
that I was passionate about.

21
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,380
Oh,
you found it right at the right time.

22
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:00,610
Oh,

23
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:03,310
dad left in order the office and
picking you up. Don't take the bus.

24
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:06,220
And he picked me up from school that day
and there was a leak in the hangar and

25
00:02:06,221 --> 00:02:07,170
we had to fix some sheet rock.

26
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:14,030
Even from the day my dad gave me that
note in school like that was the beginning

27
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:18,180
of the chain that changes your life and
you never know what it is until you look

28
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,073
back.

29
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,240
First Time I came to the
airport and saw the airplane,

30
00:02:27,241 --> 00:02:31,260
I saw something I wanted to be involved
in for the rest of my life and at that

31
00:02:31,261 --> 00:02:36,040
point I was like, whatever
it takes. I met Matt Gugan,

32
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,250
probably the most influential personality

33
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,610
and Matt showed me help with things that
he was working on it and I was actually

34
00:02:42,611 --> 00:02:43,750
getting really interested
in. I was like, oh,

35
00:02:43,751 --> 00:02:47,590
this is how it works like this and
this is how this works. I was placing,

36
00:02:47,591 --> 00:02:50,170
the blocks are so long and now
coming out to this airport,

37
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,330
I felt like I was out of that box.

38
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:56,530
Mac put me on these floats
that need to be told apart.

39
00:02:56,531 --> 00:02:59,410
So there was like a couple thousand
rivets and I just started drilling on one.

40
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,980
I think having somebody
believe in me sparked the EXEC.

41
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,020
We were working on airplanes
now you know I'm 14,

42
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:10,720
we're working on airplanes and he
is expecting me to do at your job.

43
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:16,360
He knows not going to
be perfect at the time,

44
00:03:16,361 --> 00:03:18,430
but I kept trying really
hard and you recognize that

45
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:23,870
I started using my special ed hours
reading like ground school budget,

46
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:31,560
everything I didn't learn in Algebra.
Ended up learning in metal shop.

47
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,850
Now they have the contrast
like school doesn't care.

48
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,880
And then Mac and the people in the airport
like caring, like they believe in me

49
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,610
and I was kind of addicted to it.

50
00:03:42,611 --> 00:03:45,430
I just kept coming here and
eventually they start paying me.

51
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,740
I knew as a freshman I was at least going
to be a pilot as it have an airplane.

52
00:03:50,741 --> 00:03:55,110
I didn't know exactly I was going
to do it. Um, but this was a star

53
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,680
improve.
People say like if you want something,

54
00:04:00,681 --> 00:04:04,580
you have to want it more than you want
to breathe. Wanting that airplane,

55
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:07,350
there was no option to quit on it
because I was identifying with that

56
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:14,380
when I was in a hunt for the Cessna
one 70 Mack had already said,

57
00:04:14,381 --> 00:04:15,280
you should get a project.

58
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,630
My Dad called and said that his boss knew
where one was and Max is all you just,

59
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,950
you got to buy that one max,

60
00:04:20,951 --> 00:04:23,740
like Spitz's ice tea and it's dripping
out of his like white beard. I said,

61
00:04:23,741 --> 00:04:26,380
Okay Dad, you know, I guess,
I guess we're buying it.

62
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,710
When we found the plane, it
was green and white, somebody,

63
00:04:31,711 --> 00:04:33,740
he'd carve their name into it.

64
00:04:33,741 --> 00:04:38,090
So it was this old banged up fuselage
without any wings on or anything

65
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:43,250
and it was, it was a wreck,
but like it had the potential.

66
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:50,900
Yeah, it was excited. I mean I was only
15 and I know, and an airplane. Yeah,

67
00:04:50,901 --> 00:04:54,200
sure it can fly, but it didn't
matter. It still still upset.

68
00:04:54,201 --> 00:04:57,350
I owned an airplane and the registry,
so I own one.

69
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:04,180
When I was younger I was definitely more
impatient and wanting to get things,

70
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,100
wanting to do like the action and get
like get in it and get things done and

71
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:08,963
kicking.

72
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,210
People thought like, Oh, we
bought an airplane. He'll
get bored of it eventually.

73
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,550
I couldn't imagine not finishing it.

74
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:27,870
I would work like 10 hours a day and I
started building this plant up and things

75
00:05:27,871 --> 00:05:29,100
were,
things were looking pretty good,

76
00:05:29,101 --> 00:05:33,890
but nothing ever really goes according
to plan. A lot of help today going on,

77
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:38,190
Sam,
I just wish she knew what I even did.

78
00:05:38,191 --> 00:05:41,670
Earn a hundred bucks
so that goodbye screws.

79
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:48,450
I did some construction jobs.
I dug ditches.

80
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,510
I worked at a refinery to pay
for the rent on the hanger.

81
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:58,010
I even spent months up in Alaska fishing
for salmon and fish like years just to

82
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,210
earn as much as I could.

83
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,033
Okay.

84
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,890
I was out in these storms that are telling
them to 12 foot waves, 30 knot winds.

85
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:17,540
I officially am til 11:00 AM and then
again from 3:00 PM to 11:00 PM and you

86
00:06:19,301 --> 00:06:22,220
learn how to like sleep outside, like
lean against the war. I'm exhausted.

87
00:06:22,221 --> 00:06:23,490
Sleep outside,
put on,

88
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:27,720
try to like channel that warm air coming
out of the manifold that like getting

89
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,780
hypoxia or anything

90
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:36,620
fishing taught me a lot no matter what.
When it's time to fish,

91
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,510
I have a question.
You don't quit

92
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:50,580
building the plane itself
wasn't the hard part of it.

93
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,390
Okay.

94
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:55,030
The hardest thing has been,
you know,

95
00:06:55,031 --> 00:06:59,770
keeping motivated through the entire
process and like absolutely not taking no

96
00:06:59,771 --> 00:07:03,220
for an answer and doing whatever
it takes to really get that done.

97
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:08,693
Uh,

98
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,040
I couldn't imagine not finishing it.

99
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,430
I could probably go over every part
and just tell you like the experiences

100
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:26,150
building, just that or what
happened to get that part.

101
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:35,810
I was laying with a learning disability,
but by 21 I became a certified mechanic.

102
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,930
If finish college 708 quarters early,

103
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:41,510
I'm private pilot and I
built my own airplane.

104
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,200
I didn't let what anybody else
thought of me dictate what I do

105
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,250
doubt myself. And it's not
uncommon for me to doubt myself,

106
00:07:57,251 --> 00:08:01,360
but then I see how far the planes coming
and how much progress had maintenance,

107
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:05,450
and there's no way I can go back on that.
If you want something bad enough,

108
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:08,610
we truly want something bad enough,
then you have to make the sacrifices.

109
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:13,710
I could buy steak,
but I by airplane parts instead.

110
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,430
This is just the beginning of this.

111
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:22,800
What's next for me is to
have the experience of flying
a serp plan every state,

112
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:27,600
and that's really important to me because
I know that there's a lot more than

113
00:08:27,601 --> 00:08:31,530
just country to see, and the plane
is the perfect way you do that.

114
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:04,190
[inaudible].
