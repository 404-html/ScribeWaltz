1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,540
Can you sing something for us in touch
on that is that is the scariest thing.

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:06,420
That's only sing for me on my birthday.

3
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:14,010
Your birthday.
Happy Birthday to you.

4
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:16,800
Happy Birthday to

5
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:20,943
right.

6
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,433
Okay.

7
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:38,950
We met at a photo shoot where I had to
get covered and pepto Bismol it would end

8
00:00:39,111 --> 00:00:43,910
up looking like I was wearing a suit
of pink paint, but paint is toxic,

9
00:00:43,911 --> 00:00:46,420
so we use pepto Bismol instead.
So what

10
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,100
we met at a photo shoot,

11
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:56,820
I was in a suit with a gun and then
she was covered in Pepto Bismol.

12
00:00:57,970 --> 00:00:59,600
I was trying to be a gentleman
and just like, you know,

13
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:03,970
keep my eyes up here and not make her
feel uncomfortable for the photo shoot and

14
00:01:03,971 --> 00:01:05,620
stuff like that.
So I was just trying to,

15
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:10,260
to pick her brains and ask her what
she was into and Futurama Star Trek.

16
00:01:10,261 --> 00:01:13,540
And then she had the doctor who, and I
was like, oh man. Okay. She has a nerd.

17
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:15,460
All right,
we'll get along.

18
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:17,023
MMM.

19
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:23,160
I have a tendency to be too nice and get
walked over. And he made sure that I,

20
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,920
that that doesn't happen and
that I stand up for myself.

21
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:32,100
And he's also just always himself and
never feels the need to be anybody else.

22
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,660
I love you because you're
one of the sweetest,

23
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:40,360
nicest people I've ever met in my life.
I mean,

24
00:01:40,361 --> 00:01:44,470
you're nice to people I don't think
deserve to be nice to, you know, to, um,

25
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:50,220
when I'm emotional and thrown a fit or
just being over the top about something,

26
00:01:50,381 --> 00:01:53,110
you're always there to the
center mean you're just,

27
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:57,040
you're that little piece of me that I
didn't realize I needed until I met you.

28
00:01:59,160 --> 00:01:59,950
Okay.

29
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,720
I don't know if that's everything
I was supposed to say or not.

30
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:08,080
It's a lot easier when she's not
listening. Who said I love you first

31
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:13,200
she did by accident. Um, but I
was leaving for work. He was,

32
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:16,820
walked me to the door and was saying by
why left for work and then he asked for

33
00:02:16,821 --> 00:02:19,870
when I was like, okay, well I love
you, bye. And then close the door.

34
00:02:19,871 --> 00:02:23,290
And we both realized like I was on one
side of the door and he was on the other

35
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,020
and we both realize that it's the
first time you said it. And I was like,

36
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:28,330
what if he didn't mean to say that
I don't want to embarrass him.

37
00:02:28,331 --> 00:02:30,160
So I like started walking
to my car and I'm like,

38
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:33,610
but if he did realize it now I feel
so weird is I'm going to run back up.

39
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:37,450
So I ran back up to my apartment all the
way up the stairs and then ran up and I

40
00:02:37,451 --> 00:02:41,370
was like, did you just say I love you?
And he's like, yes, I did by accident.

41
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:44,550
I was like, well I love you
too. And then it all worked out.

42
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:50,280
She was on her way to work and I stay
in at her place just kind of like

43
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,650
accidentally. I was like,
all right, I love you, bye.

44
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,530
And then she left and then like
as soon as she shut the door,

45
00:02:55,531 --> 00:03:00,190
I remember being like, oh Geez, why don't
I do that? That was going to be weird.

46
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:02,260
But then yeah,
just like a movie,

47
00:03:02,261 --> 00:03:07,261
she came running right back in and just
kiss me real passionately and Israel

48
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:09,610
sweet and made me feel
better about everything.

49
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:11,383
So

50
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:13,530
putting on her seatbelt,

51
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:21,590
I uh, I think she gets caught
up in her own head though.

52
00:03:21,591 --> 00:03:24,440
I think that's her biggest
struggle is just, you know,

53
00:03:24,441 --> 00:03:28,610
wanting to make sure everybody's happy
around her and that everybody is treated

54
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,061
fairly.

55
00:03:29,061 --> 00:03:33,680
So she gets kind of in her head too much
and then I have to let her know that

56
00:03:33,681 --> 00:03:34,730
she's doing okay.

57
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,110
Did you talk about my theme?

58
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,033
So off.

59
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,130
Okay.

60
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:44,880
Um,
hey bitch.

61
00:03:44,881 --> 00:03:49,570
Maddix sometimes he just agrees with me
even though he has no idea what we're

62
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:50,423
saying.

63
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,540
I kept trying to make plans and nothing
was ever going to seem good enough and I

64
00:03:56,541 --> 00:04:00,080
was just going to keep postponing it
until something was perfect. So I finally,

65
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:04,760
me being the jerk I am and having
a really bad sense of humor,

66
00:04:04,761 --> 00:04:07,920
I thought April fools would be the
best day to do it. So I was like,

67
00:04:07,921 --> 00:04:11,620
you know what? This has to happen.
This is a beautiful day for it.

68
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,990
If we posted it online,
which we didn't. So anyways,

69
00:04:14,991 --> 00:04:16,960
we go up to this place called [inaudible].

70
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:22,190
I had previously gotten our dog Ava,
a little dog tag that just said,

71
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:24,560
do you want to watch cartoons with me?
You know,

72
00:04:24,561 --> 00:04:27,890
cause that's one of our big things is we
watch cartoons and we're big geeks and

73
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,640
we get to mountain now and I tell her
to take a look at the new dog tag.

74
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,760
So you're saying, do you want to
watch cartoons with me? And I go,

75
00:04:34,761 --> 00:04:38,660
well yeah know I'm bent over on one.
He was like, yeah, for forever with me.

76
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,770
And you know, she said yes. And
it was, it was pretty amazing.

77
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,530
He picked me up.

78
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:48,520
He had just gotten like a nicer button
down that I didn't recognize. He's like,

79
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:52,600
Oh yeah, just bought this today. I was
like, Oh nice. We go home. And he's like,

80
00:04:52,601 --> 00:04:56,110
well I kinda had a plan for us today. I
hope that's okay. And I was like, okay.

81
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:59,750
He said we were going hiking, but he
was wearing his nicer new button down.

82
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:02,140
I was like, are you sure you want to
wear that? Hiking, and he's like, oh,

83
00:05:02,141 --> 00:05:05,870
it'll be fine. I was
like, something's strange.

84
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:10,810
And then it goes to hug me in his heart
beating super fast. And I was like,

85
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,790
I think he's going to propose today.

86
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,020
He asked me to look at our dog's collar
and I immediately knew. I'm like,

87
00:05:17,021 --> 00:05:21,100
that's a very reared request.
I think something very
specific is about to happen.

88
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,790
He put a a a dog tag on our,

89
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:28,960
our dog's collar, uh, that said
one to watch cartoons with me.

90
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:32,380
And so I look at him and I'm like, wait,
what? And then he's like, I'm sorry.

91
00:05:32,381 --> 00:05:34,510
I wanted something
specific that I can say,

92
00:05:34,511 --> 00:05:36,430
do you want to watch
cartoons with me forever?

93
00:05:36,431 --> 00:05:40,240
And then got down on one knee and
proposed with his grandmother's ring.

94
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,470
And it was very cute.

95
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:49,180
He is my support in every single way.

96
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:53,140
And uh, he makes me
happy. He makes me laugh.

97
00:05:53,141 --> 00:05:56,920
He makes me take life a little
less seriously. So I think without,

98
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:00,260
I would just be lost completely

99
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:03,630
for the short version

100
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:09,220
and devastated. No, what
I would do without you,

101
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,340
man. I'm trying not to
use bad words, but man,

102
00:06:16,341 --> 00:06:18,980
it'd be scary not to have
you that wild to think about.

103
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,513
I don't like thinking about it.

104
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:23,090
Okay,

105
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:27,120
man, you're making me sound like the
Ice Queen, but I love you very much.

106
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:29,523
Okay.

107
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:33,860
We actually scripted that. Yeah, abuse.

108
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:38,810
I appreciate it guys. You're all
doing it. Awesome. Thank you guys.

109
00:06:38,811 --> 00:06:42,140
I hope we were abuse. I
don't know about you, man.

110
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:47,650
I feel pretty lonely right
now after watching that
video forever alone together,

111
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:54,080
my fellow sense, it's out there. Join
