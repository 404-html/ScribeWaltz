1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,530
Hey guys, what's up? My name is Peter
Sudara, so my name is Yoshi, Sodexo,

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:06,030
and today we're going to be
playing some candid confession.

3
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:17,390
Yoshi. Hi. Peter's
miss. Meet you. Meet you

4
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:22,830
face like,
oh,

5
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,780
is this not the dating one

6
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,520
dose and stuff like that?
Man, we already had going on.

7
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:36,520
What is your relationship to each other?
We're brothers. Yes, and I'm a better one.

8
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:39,370
The better one.
I've known him all his life.

9
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,790
He hasn't known me all my life though.
I've known him all my life,

10
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:46,780
so technically you haven't
known me all your life. Oh,

11
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:50,590
me and Yoshi are pretty open book.
We know each other very well or so.

12
00:00:50,591 --> 00:00:51,870
We think we're still,
we think so.

13
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:55,010
I'm kind of scared saying
that we're going to go.

14
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,760
Never have I ever hit on
one of your female friends?

15
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:08,500
Three, two, one? Nope.
Nope. Oh yeah. Well I,

16
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:13,420
I know you have. Every time I tell him,
I was like, hey, I liked this girl.

17
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:18,440
Wait, no, you know that's true.
That's true. Your first girlfriend,

18
00:01:18,441 --> 00:01:22,530
who wasn't going that I told him
that he thought she was cute.

19
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:27,400
I didn't know you were going for her work.
You? I don't know. I don't know. Thanks.

20
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:28,703
You

21
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:33,070
never have I ever blamed
something I did on you.

22
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,910
Ready? Three, two, one.
We do this all the time.

23
00:01:39,911 --> 00:01:43,720
I feel like our dynamic and
brothers is almost as twins.

24
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:46,390
Like you do something bad, you
blame it on me. I do something bad.

25
00:01:46,391 --> 00:01:46,901
I blame it on you.

26
00:01:46,901 --> 00:01:50,950
And then eventually we realize we should
just keep it to ourselves because I

27
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,510
know another one of us gets
in trouble. You know it.

28
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,090
I made us a lot closer as friends.

29
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,590
It's not like that's happened
in the recent years, not as TMI

30
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:07,870
love you like, okay. As a child,

31
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:10,480
as a child,
like maybe like three or four.

32
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:14,380
I remember peeing on
the floor on accident,

33
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:19,090
like I couldn't hold it and I was so
scared of getting in trouble and I blame

34
00:02:19,091 --> 00:02:22,330
that on your sheet because obviously as
a child you don't think about that stuff.

35
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:25,750
You're just like, oh my pants
are wet. But he's right there.

36
00:02:25,751 --> 00:02:29,170
So that could be him like you don't know.

37
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:36,890
I know. Oh my God, we were
such dumb kids who saying we,

38
00:02:36,891 --> 00:02:40,270
hold on,
I didn't do that.

39
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,360
I can't actually remember what I've done.
Use a big brain farts on me.

40
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:49,960
Oh yeah, totally. Yeah. That's
like, I guess kids are easy.

41
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:53,140
Never have I ever cried in front of you.

42
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:56,380
Oh, three, two, one

43
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:00,360
all the time.
We're emotional crybaby.

44
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,620
Both of us tears everywhere.
I mean, watching movies,

45
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:09,160
watching movies up.
You weren't like in all the floor.

46
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:13,480
Very sensitive dudes like we have.
We talk about our feelings a lot.

47
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:17,060
So a lot of times we'll argue and get
to a point of even tears. Tears. Yeah.

48
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:20,720
They were arguing and
yeah.

49
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,540
Never have I ever been jealous
because of a girl you've been with.

50
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:30,850
All right. Three, two, one. No, no.

51
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,480
Yeah. Somebody, it's like off, off limits.

52
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,760
I can't even look at that person.
It's weird.

53
00:03:36,761 --> 00:03:40,330
Like even that's also why I went like
the girls in the friends thing. I mean,

54
00:03:40,331 --> 00:03:45,200
obviously it didn't matter to you.
So, uh, and just kidding. You know, I,

55
00:03:45,201 --> 00:03:46,570
you know, I actually had no idea. Right.

56
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,270
I don't realize it until I
was older and I was like, Hey,

57
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:52,590
I was just totally harmonious that
you guys would have been so bad again.

58
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:56,420
Oh my gosh, yes. Holy Crap. Thank
you for saving me from that.

59
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:00,760
Yes or no. Sometimes I question, I dunno.

60
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:05,800
Sometimes I question if what I'm
doing has any meaning or value.

61
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,330
Okay. Uh, yeah, three, two, one

62
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,993
definitely.

63
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:18,060
Can I do that because
partially, no. Absolutely. So
that's a, that's a yes. Okay.

64
00:04:18,061 --> 00:04:19,500
Then I'll just take your head like,
okay.

65
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:23,370
Even if you thought about it a little bit,
but if you don't question it,

66
00:04:23,371 --> 00:04:26,700
then how do you know if all you're doing
is the right thing? Right. I agree.

67
00:04:26,701 --> 00:04:29,820
I think if you're, if you're questioning
it and you're still doing it,

68
00:04:29,821 --> 00:04:31,860
that's why it went nowhere.
The rest, but the same time.

69
00:04:31,861 --> 00:04:34,560
Because at first I was like, yes.
Sometimes I think about that,

70
00:04:34,561 --> 00:04:37,190
but then I always come to the conclusion
of like, of course, yeah, there's,

71
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,041
there's meaningful it.

72
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:41,070
That's why I do it because at the end
of the day you got to realize that like

73
00:04:41,071 --> 00:04:43,170
what you're doing can make a difference.

74
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:46,430
And as long as it makes a difference
in one person's life, dude. Yeah. Done.

75
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:50,840
And if you're not looking at it in that
way, why are you doing it? Fame. Money.

76
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,640
You're right.

77
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:56,490
I guess never have I ever felt
jealous of your accomplishments.

78
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:00,210
All right. Okay. Three, two, one.

79
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:02,571
I mean,
let's be honest,

80
00:05:02,571 --> 00:05:05,860
it's like when you first got power
rangers and I auditioned hard for it.

81
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:08,770
Like with Donald Trump,
jr knew how hard I was working for that.

82
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,190
So I told you that though. That's, I
think that's the main thing with us.

83
00:05:12,191 --> 00:05:16,150
Like both of us have spoken to each other.
Like if I'm feeling jealous about it,

84
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:17,160
I'll let you know.

85
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,860
You've known when I've been jealous of
stuff to like social media, social media.

86
00:05:20,861 --> 00:05:24,730
Yeah. Yours was definitely way more at
the top. At the beginning I was very like,

87
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:29,260
dude, I am nothing right
now. I'm a nobody. I was so
used to it buddy growing up.

88
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:31,960
Oh you're Yoshi is a little brother.
And then it became,

89
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:35,770
I'm Peter's brother and I was like, what
is going on? And I was like, I can't,

90
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,710
I can't ask him for help because I
want to just do my own social media.

91
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:41,920
But then when I was like, you know, I was
like, I'm just going to ask. I'm like,

92
00:05:41,921 --> 00:05:45,560
hey man, like what do I do with this whole
thing? And you were like, here, put this,

93
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:47,590
try this on with this. And I'm
like, oh yeah, that's cool.

94
00:05:47,591 --> 00:05:50,020
I would never think to put
those two things together.

95
00:05:50,021 --> 00:05:53,560
And now my social media is good and
it's because of me asking for your help.

96
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,860
Before I was like, no, he's not going
to help me. He's, he wants this for him.

97
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:01,760
I put it in my head that he wants to
be the guy who's like, oh, oh, you're,

98
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:04,200
you're Peter's brother.
I put that on him. I do.

99
00:06:04,201 --> 00:06:07,250
We never want to call him Peter's brother.

100
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:12,200
Just kidding. Go happens again,
please let me know. Absolutely.

101
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:17,650
That's what we do now. You know? Oh
man, you mean versus the world, right.

102
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:21,160
It's ups and down. Of
course it is. I shut up.

103
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:26,140
Never have I ever told you why I love you.

104
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:30,623
Okay.

105
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:38,920
Three, two, one. I don't really have,

106
00:06:38,921 --> 00:06:42,770
I think maybe if anything it's, it
would be more red for me. I don't know.

107
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:46,060
I don't know. I don't think we
have ever really talked about that.

108
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,510
We just kind of like new cause I mean
it's all this stuff that we talk about,

109
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:52,030
all of this, you know, we're
always supporting each other.

110
00:06:52,031 --> 00:06:56,080
We're trying to pull each other
even when it gets down bad. Yeah.

111
00:06:56,230 --> 00:07:01,230
It's like you're mad at me because
you love me and can see me do better.

112
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:06,780
You're an amazing big brother. I
know. Yeah. No, you really are.

113
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:10,410
You really are you? I, I
can't, I am so blessed.

114
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,150
It sounds like the most basic compliment.

115
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:16,230
I can't sit in there the way you're one
of the most genuine dudes I've ever met.

116
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,400
I am not that good of a dude to you.

117
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:25,490
I feel like I screwed up with you a
lot and yet you still look up to me and

118
00:07:25,621 --> 00:07:28,560
that's a big reason why I love you.

119
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,200
You have been the one that pushed
me to become the way that I am.

120
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:39,000
It's funny. I mean, I got that from
you. I think you did. I didn't do that.

121
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:43,710
And you say all this stuff about me and
my action, whatever, but me getting Cota,

122
00:07:43,711 --> 00:07:48,330
was you seeing something in that character
that I could do? And also yourself.

123
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:52,200
Sure. You just put an image
in my head and that was it.

124
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:57,390
It wasn't like it will be a director
and that's what I believe you can.

125
00:07:57,391 --> 00:08:00,000
And, and, and I'm ready to be
by your side when that happens.

126
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:05,090
Thanks for being good friend
and brother. Ah, I got you.

127
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,710
No, I don't want to do this again. No.

128
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:18,270
Oh, hi jubilee fam. I'm Ian. I'm Taylor.

129
