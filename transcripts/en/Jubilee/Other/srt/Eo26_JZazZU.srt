1
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:11,190
Sorry.
Excuse me.

2
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,910
There are people we encounter who
changed the trajectory of our lives.

3
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:19,050
Richard was one of them,
but let me start from the beginning.

4
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:26,530
It was the first day of college and you
know what that's like. Hi, I'm Mandy.

5
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,630
Mandy,
Mandy.

6
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:38,940
Yeah, that's me. Sum it
up. I was a nerd. Yup.

7
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,150
The type of near that builds extra credit
molecules for the first day of school.

8
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:52,190
Did you catch that? That's Natalie.
Well, we'll get back to her later. Hey,

9
00:00:58,820 --> 00:00:59,653
let me help

10
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:08,180
your freshmen
first lesson in college.

11
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,470
No where you're going.
Where are you headed anyway?

12
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:27,660
Needless to say,
it was a rough first day of school,

13
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,810
but for whatever reason
Richard was nice to be done.

14
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:38,070
Yeah. Finish last week. Did
you do phone 15 by any chance?

15
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,500
You know the one was the falling
methyl methacrylate. Yup.

16
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:46,410
Cause you want me with that one?
To be honest,

17
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,900
I don't exactly remember will be tossed.
But here's the important part.

18
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,960
During natural like this, do you want to
be a rocket scientist or something? No,

19
00:01:54,961 --> 00:01:57,210
actually I want to work
at a software company.

20
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,210
I actually interned at one last summer.

21
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:06,180
I'm jealous. That's my drink. Over time,

22
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:09,030
we became good study buddies
and eventually great friends.

23
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,960
Richard encouraged me to be more confident
and to step outside of my comfort

24
00:02:12,961 --> 00:02:14,940
zone.
Remember Natalie?

25
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:20,440
This covalent bond deals here.
It's about right,

26
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:25,840
right Andy. Andy. Oh yeah.

27
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,830
That's great. I mean, that's
right. Second to girl, isn't it?

28
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:36,220
Who is it? Silver. The blue.

29
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:42,600
One of my classes. Don't be so obvious.
She's cute. She could talk to her.

30
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,990
I want to know what to say.
Well,

31
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,140
let's start by telling her about
your Pokemon card collection. Really,

32
00:02:52,141 --> 00:02:56,310
he thinks she didn't like that. That was
just a job. Never tell anyone about that,

33
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:57,483
ever.

34
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,990
Why don't you start by introducing
yourself and never really talked to girls.

35
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,140
Andy, you're, you're like
one of the best guys. I know.

36
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,753
You can't really do it.

37
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:21,950
Turns out not only was really nice and
also need to help with the Oregon homer

38
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:26,330
spray.
Everything else starts to fall into place.

39
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:34,040
Hey Richard, I got that interview for the
internship at your company. That center.

40
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:38,930
Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God.

41
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:44,510
Richard. I'm terrible at interviews.
All right, let's try this one more time,

42
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,600
but I also learned that change
is never easy. So Mr. Park,

43
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:50,810
why don't you tell me why you
want to work for this firm? Well,

44
00:03:50,811 --> 00:03:54,350
I guess because I always wanted to use
my engineering background to help others.

45
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,680
All right. Now tell me about
your leadership experiences.

46
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,000
I don't have any. Yeah,
I wouldn't say that,

47
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:06,410
but actually that's fine because they
know you're a freshman and you don't

48
00:04:06,411 --> 00:04:10,370
really have that many anyways.
But you know, that reminds me.

49
00:04:10,371 --> 00:04:13,800
Have you ever thought about running
for Engineering Study President? No.

50
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:17,030
This is my last year as president and I
actually think you would do great job.

51
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,530
No, I don't. I don't run for anything if
dude, it's not a problem. Um, you know,

52
00:04:21,531 --> 00:04:24,990
I think you're well qualified. You're
passionate, you're super smart. You know,

53
00:04:24,991 --> 00:04:27,010
you helped me with my
homework all the time, dude.

54
00:04:27,011 --> 00:04:30,740
We can even make flyers and hot buttons
with your face on it and no, Richard,

55
00:04:30,741 --> 00:04:34,850
I'm not going to run for that. Can
we just get back to this? All right.

56
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,730
What would you say are
your greatest strengths?

57
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,020
Well,
I guess I'm good at engineering.

58
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:51,310
You're good. I engineering.
Dude. That's a terrible answer.

59
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:55,030
Try it again. Seriously. What do you
think are your greatest strengths?

60
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:00,910
Should, I don't know, Andy, can you
just think for one second? I mean,

61
00:05:00,911 --> 00:05:04,270
I can think of 10 things you're incredibly
good at and you came and think about.

62
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:08,710
One, just help me out here. We've been
doing this for two hours. I'm not you.

63
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:11,770
I can't be present. I can't
do this interview. Okay.

64
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:20,300
Funny thing about life is greatest fear
is often allowing ourselves imagine what

65
00:05:20,301 --> 00:05:21,134
we can become.

66
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:33,950
I never showed up for the interview. I
was afraid of failing, but to be honest,

67
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:36,100
I was more afraid of letting Richard down.

68
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,183
Okay.

69
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:06,090
It's Richard. I'm a senior and a couple
weeks and you haven't been in class.

70
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,010
Just wanted to check in on you

71
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:16,450
and later realized that Richard only
pushed me because he saw something in me

72
00:06:16,451 --> 00:06:20,440
that I hadn't seen him myself.
I can vouch for him.

73
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,980
He's incredibly smart and
he's a really great guy.

74
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:28,570
Please interview him for the summer
internship. Just give them a chance.

75
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,970
His belief in me inspired
me to believe in myself.

76
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:35,220
So I decided to take a leap of faith.

77
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,450
Hey,
need a hand.

78
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:49,600
There are people we encountered who
changed the trajectory of our lives.

79
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:53,590
Richard was one of them.
I wouldn't be who I am without Richard.

80
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:58,960
Very special person. Over the past year,
I've gotten to know this guy really well,

81
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:04,980
and I've had the privilege of forming an
incredible bond with him as his mentor.

82
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:10,940
So that's why today I'm extremely proud
to introduce him for the first time ever

83
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:15,880
as the next president of the
engineering society. My close friend,

84
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:17,283
Andy Party.

85
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:23,783
Thanks Richard.

86
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:28,710
I want to start by just
thinking everyone here today go.

87
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,360
How much of a privilege or greatest one
is someone who inspires to be what? No,

88
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:34,203
weekend.

89
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:44,270
Uh,

90
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:50,170
yeah.
