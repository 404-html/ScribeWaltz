1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,990
I love you because of
your money. Yeah. $43.

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:10,360
Can we go first? Yeah.
Okay. So does that mean

3
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:12,893
I think you

4
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:17,853
fix her hair?

5
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,260
Uh, I think well first thing that
comes to mind is just best friends.

6
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,620
Exactly. Even though it's like the
cheesiest thing in the world. Um,

7
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:37,980
well I didn't think it was a real thing
until we did it because we were actually

8
00:00:38,441 --> 00:00:40,210
best friends before,
before we did it. Yeah.

9
00:00:40,211 --> 00:00:44,660
So it was just this weird like seamless
transition thing. But um, I dunno.

10
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:47,020
Weird. We're very weird. Yes. Yeah.

11
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:50,013
Can you hear me?

12
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:56,950
I Hate Chicago. Okay. Yeah, no. See

13
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,250
my very,
very first impression of her,

14
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,490
I thought she was really
cute and she was super fun.

15
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,400
But then my next impression of her was
a few months later when I moved in with

16
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:11,220
her best friend and that's when
I like really got to know her.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,090
I don't like your haircut.

18
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:21,030
Sorry.
You're saying something Sassy right now.

19
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:27,370
So actually I hate telling us because
it sounds so like gross and millennial,

20
00:01:28,641 --> 00:01:33,530
but the first time I ever saw him was on
my snapchat story. It wasn't until like

21
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:40,050
six months later maybe that he
randomly moved in with my best friend.

22
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,800
We just started hanging out
as friends and became really,

23
00:01:44,801 --> 00:01:49,090
really good friends and it was
just this super platonic thing.

24
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:51,820
Um,
well I told them when I first saw you,

25
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:55,670
and it was on my friend's snapchat story,
such a millennial news.

26
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:04,980
It was August 8th, 2016. Um,

27
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:10,060
and we went to Sushi stop afterwards we
walked to Gelson's and bought Oreos and

28
00:02:10,281 --> 00:02:13,310
then came back to my apartment
and watched stranger things.

29
00:02:13,311 --> 00:02:17,510
I think our first date was
a at Sushi stop. August 8th,

30
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:23,030
uh, 20. What's this year?
[inaudible] 16, I think.

31
00:02:23,031 --> 00:02:27,440
Yeah. And then we stopped into the
grocery store right across the street,

32
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:32,270
got a pack of Oreos and then went back
to his place and watch stranger things.

33
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:35,070
What'd you say?
Oh,

34
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:40,130
I said our first date was
August 8th, 2016. Nice, Nice.

35
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:42,470
Let's see if she stopped. Yeah.
Did you tell him about the Oreos?

36
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:50,390
Okay, I'm glad I got the show right. Wow.

37
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,150
Oh Man. I guess the first
thing, she's so funny.

38
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:58,400
Then she'll like,
she'll be honest with you.

39
00:02:58,401 --> 00:03:00,310
She'll give you great advice and she'll

40
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:05,350
give you like advice to,
to better you as a person.

41
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:10,030
Ah, I don't know. He

42
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:15,830
is the nicest guy in the world.
Um,

43
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:21,160
he's really, uh, has no shame
in just a way that's like,

44
00:03:21,161 --> 00:03:24,580
he is super,
completely himself all the time,

45
00:03:24,581 --> 00:03:28,510
which is unreal and cool
and I love that about him.

46
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,140
And um, he makes me
laugh. He's really funny,

47
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:37,150
but I'm not going to tell him myself
that because then he'll get cocky.

48
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:41,950
So I said, you had no shame like
in just being yourself wherever,

49
00:03:41,951 --> 00:03:43,630
whenever,
which I think is cool.

50
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:48,670
Cool. I said you were super funny.
Wow. First thing I said, I mean,

51
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,970
so I said you were funny.

52
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,090
Really don't just calm down.

53
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:03,810
She has like seven Billy and
red notifications on her phone

54
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,520
and it didn't dry.
Like I,

55
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:10,410
if I have like one unread email I have
to like get rid of it and she has like

56
00:04:10,411 --> 00:04:15,411
6.5 million emails and like 48
notifications from some random APP.

57
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:20,610
She now two ways. Um,
but that's not, I mean,

58
00:04:20,611 --> 00:04:23,850
I dunno. It's like, you know, is
anything, it is kind of funny. Um,

59
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
but she's also a really great front seat
driver and she gets a little nervous

60
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,090
when I get close to cars
and stuff like that.

61
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,050
He, this is just going
to reflect poorly on me,

62
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,470
but he just touches me way too much.

63
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:45,500
But like his love language is physical
touch and mine's do I get really hot

64
00:04:47,251 --> 00:04:48,090
really easily.

65
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:53,300
So sometimes I'll just be sitting
there like in my own sadness and hot,

66
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:58,500
just this awful thing and, and he'll
like come up and like try to like,

67
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:01,960
you know, touch me or something like
that and I'm like, you gotta stop it.

68
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,560
You can't do that. This is another
thing that's like a good thing.

69
00:05:04,561 --> 00:05:09,060
But he never gets angry.
Just let it out sometimes.

70
00:05:09,061 --> 00:05:12,720
You know? Uh, we were on the way
here and I was telling him like,

71
00:05:12,721 --> 00:05:17,721
who will sit in a lane of traffic that
is not moving while the lane next to him

72
00:05:17,881 --> 00:05:22,230
is just zooming by because he's just
like content with wherever he's at,

73
00:05:22,231 --> 00:05:23,064
which is great.

74
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,460
I, there was one part where
I knew what you were saying.

75
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:30,500
I'm hot touch you all the time.

76
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:37,010
I knew it was my science. I
said he touches me too much.
I would just say, yeah. Uh,

77
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:40,730
I said that you have like 60 billion
unread notifications on your phone.

78
00:05:40,731 --> 00:05:42,530
It's true.
God.

79
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:46,970
And that doesn't mean that you're
a fantastic front seat driver.

80
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:54,230
I told him you're not aggressive
enough like rep rose. All right.

81
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:58,310
I probably look bad because my thing
was I was just complaining about things

82
00:05:58,311 --> 00:05:59,800
that are like good qualities to have

83
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:03,260
as a human being, you know?
Oh, he's two functioning.

84
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:08,820
He doesn't get angry, you
know, like don't do it.

85
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:10,523
But yeah,

86
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,110
wait a beat. Great. Stop.

87
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:18,440
Um, no, we,

88
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:23,020
I mean we honestly really haven't had
like a big fight or something like crazy,

89
00:06:23,021 --> 00:06:27,940
like scary thing or whatever
in a previous relationship.

90
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,220
Um,
but I had been,

91
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:35,850
someone had been disloyal to me to
say politely and so I had like not,

92
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:37,810
it wasn't,
I wouldn't say trust issues,

93
00:06:37,811 --> 00:06:42,811
but I was like pretty insecure about
and just other guys in general.

94
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:43,991
And I would just,

95
00:06:43,991 --> 00:06:47,980
it was like in my head that something bad
would happen if like she got too close

96
00:06:47,981 --> 00:06:49,300
to another guy or something like that.

97
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:53,860
I think it was kind of a good thing
that we like had these, you know,

98
00:06:53,861 --> 00:06:58,861
sometimes arguments or fights or whatever
about like this insecurity that I had

99
00:06:59,321 --> 00:07:01,690
to get over. And you know, she
was actually really great with it.

100
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:06,970
He had some trust issues at the
beginning of the relationship.

101
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:10,970
He didn't even, he was like,
I don't want to be that guy.
I don't, I don't, you know,

102
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,400
I want you to hang out with your friends.
I don't even care.

103
00:07:13,401 --> 00:07:16,790
But for some reason like it's
bothering me and I can't, you know.

104
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:21,410
And so that was just something we had
to work through a little bit because I

105
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,850
don't think I gave him enough
grace in the beginning of that. Um,

106
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,230
because I had a really hard time
understanding why it was happening.

107
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,640
I said when I was like annoying and

108
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:35,000
I said the same thing but not
in those words. Nice. Yeah.

109
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:43,050
It's really truly almost hard
to explain like everyone,

110
00:07:43,051 --> 00:07:44,970
like has this like ideal person and like,

111
00:07:44,971 --> 00:07:49,760
it's like a sheet of like kind of things
you think you want in a person, um,

112
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:51,150
or you think you need an a person.

113
00:07:51,151 --> 00:07:56,151
And then once you meet like the one that
just exceeds all of those expectations

114
00:07:57,241 --> 00:07:59,820
and like every way possible.

115
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,440
I just,
I wake up every day,

116
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,800
like truly want just wanting
to be hers or be with her,

117
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:14,550
hang out with her,
spend time with her or you know,

118
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:15,910
do something for her.

119
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:21,550
I love who she makes me
and I love who she is and,

120
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,830
and how she makes me a better person.
And just,

121
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:32,070
uh,
it yourself,

122
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,393
um,

123
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:38,970
who have like, no, he's
gonna make it worse.

124
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:42,680
Uh,
yeah,

125
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,900
this start to finish.

126
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,440
She's like as perfect
as you could get for me.

127
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,230
And that includes all of her,

128
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:57,710
her flaws and her accepting single one
of my flaws and me for everything that I

129
00:08:57,751 --> 00:09:00,870
am,
I can never find someone like her.

130
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:03,690
I don't think there's anyone
better out there for me.

131
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:06,343
So

132
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:13,300
I never have to be afraid of introducing
them to someone because I know that

133
00:09:14,391 --> 00:09:18,370
they're going to like him
because everyone does. Gosh,

134
00:09:18,371 --> 00:09:23,371
he's just so sweet and caring and loving,

135
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:28,220
like just so loving,
you know,

136
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,910
so much so that I get
annoyed by it sometimes,

137
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:35,920
but he really wants me to love myself,

138
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:43,250
really shows me how I now
believe I deserve to be loved.

139
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,900
I don't know. I just, I'm so bad though.

140
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:52,880
Uh, but you know, he, he's
so good. Okay. I'm done now.

141
00:09:52,881 --> 00:09:55,360
I can't, I can't do this anymore. It

142
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:01,070
freaks you out. Okay. You're done now.

143
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:04,000
So what'd you say?

144
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:08,560
I said that I love you
because of your money.

145
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,140
Yeah.
$43.

146
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:19,600
Nice honey. I said, I said, I, uh,

147
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:22,400
