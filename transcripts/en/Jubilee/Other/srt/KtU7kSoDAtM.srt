1
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:09,040
I think my boyfriend's cheating
on me with my godsister.

2
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,520
I had just transferred
to a new high school.

3
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,250
It was scary and know anybody there.

4
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:28,550
I thought that was going to be
my only problem in high school.

5
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:30,650
For the first time in my life,

6
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:35,680
I started to experience a release
of your issues with my health.

7
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:42,610
I had all of these scars and open wounds
on my back that I could never reach.

8
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,060
So here I was in this new high school,

9
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,720
live an immune system that was just
kind of falling apart on itself.

10
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:55,940
But there was one person there
who looked at me and said, hey,

11
00:00:55,941 --> 00:00:58,370
you are really amazing.

12
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,090
He would make me feel like
there was nothing wrong with me.

13
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:06,560
He would be with me when I was sick.
You would put lotion on my scars.

14
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:10,880
First three months of our relationship
I was really, really happy.

15
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:15,740
But after three months he
started to get possessive.

16
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:19,220
Everyone I was talking to
made him uncomfortable.

17
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:22,160
It kept cutting off.

18
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:27,760
People thinking one day I'll make the
right group of friends and he'll be okay

19
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:32,270
and then it started getting worse.

20
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:37,930
It didn't matter if it was my shoulder
or my arm or my hands or my thighs.

21
00:01:38,271 --> 00:01:43,271
He had had to be touching me and I kept
making all these excuses as to why it

22
00:01:45,141 --> 00:01:48,620
was okay.
So I kept going on like that.

23
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:54,360
After about a year and
a half to two years, um,

24
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:59,570
my family decided they wanted to send me
to the Philippines and my grandparents

25
00:01:59,571 --> 00:02:03,140
were over there and they want me to stay
with them. And when I finally told him,

26
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,650
he started crying, got really,
really upset and he said,

27
00:02:06,651 --> 00:02:11,150
you're going to be gone for a month.
Why do you have to go now? Why do you,

28
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:14,810
why do you need to be going to
the Philippines for a month?

29
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,210
I'll be here when you come back,

30
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:20,960
but please just come back right away.

31
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,140
And I felt guilty because I was actually
really glad that I didn't have phone

32
00:02:27,141 --> 00:02:30,770
service for a lot of it because I
had an excuse. I was like, I don't,

33
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,790
I can't contact you because I'm
with my family. I could just

34
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,630
explore and be free with my family.

35
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:42,470
We had taken these really cute
pictures in the Philippines.

36
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:47,690
My profile picture for the last year and
a half of our relationship was a photo

37
00:02:47,691 --> 00:02:52,520
of the two of us and I thought, you
know what? I think you'd like this one.

38
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:55,010
And I have,
it's been a year since I've changed it,

39
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:58,250
but then my godsister 30 commenting on it,

40
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:03,670
she thought it was really cute. And
then my boyfriend started commenting to,

41
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:09,070
this is the first time my boyfriend
has ever gone in along with a friend of

42
00:03:09,071 --> 00:03:09,700
mine.

43
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:14,380
This is the friend I needed to have in
my life so that my relationship can be

44
00:03:14,381 --> 00:03:16,690
okay.
The next day.

45
00:03:16,691 --> 00:03:21,691
He told me that the two of them had stayed
up until 7:00 AM webcamming with each

46
00:03:22,151 --> 00:03:26,960
other and just talking.
And I thought it was a little strange,

47
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:32,060
but it was kind of cute. And then
a couple of days later he told me,

48
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:36,410
I think we need to wait until you
come home if we're going to talk.

49
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:46,090
I kept asking him, what's going on? What
happened? Are you okay? And he said, no,

50
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,270
something's going on.
And it's not a good time to talk to you.

51
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:55,070
I was so upset. Like, why would you
just cut me out? Like personally,

52
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,100
I don't understand why
you're doing this to me.

53
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:00,520
It hit me that something was
going on between the two of them.

54
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:07,540
So I got angry and I
messaged him and I told him,

55
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:11,980
what are you doing?
What's going on between you two?

56
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:16,990
Cause I don't understand and why can you
talk to her? But you can't talk to me.

57
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,560
My grandparents,

58
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:26,650
I think my boyfriend's cheating
on me with my godsister,

59
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:34,030
the same boy that had been to their 50th
anniversary just a couple months ago.

60
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,060
The Guy, I told them I thought I
was gonna marry and I came home,

61
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,170
he met me at my house and um,

62
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,870
I had a box ready with all of his things.
He was smiling the whole time.

63
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:52,930
He told me, you know, I love you

64
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:55,613
and

65
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:00,690
my life will never be the same
because of you. That even at school

66
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:07,220
my ex would still comment on all the
things about our relationship that didn't

67
00:05:07,981 --> 00:05:08,814
work.

68
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:14,130
He specifically told me if there's one
thing I don't miss about our relationship.

69
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:17,700
I was taking care of
you when you were sick.

70
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:25,150
My health, it's all time low. Well,

71
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,660
it's like my body knew that he wasn't
there to take care of me anymore.

72
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:31,210
My hair started coming out.

73
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:36,760
I didn't have any energy
to get up out of my bed.

74
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:41,200
Everything about me was breaking
and everyone could see it.

75
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:46,180
I felt so bad because I knew
it was killing my parents,
but they were all I had.

76
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:52,650
I woke up 3:00 AM one night and I was
trying to get to the bathroom because my

77
00:05:53,711 --> 00:05:54,760
skin was stinking.

78
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:59,120
I heard my mom to my dad,

79
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:04,280
she was so upset. She's like,
this is getting so expensive.

80
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:09,980
We can't afford, zoo is forever. My
Dad was comforting her and telling her,

81
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:13,490
you know, we'll find a way to
pay for things and we'll be okay.

82
00:06:13,491 --> 00:06:15,680
And it didn't even sound
like he was convinced.

83
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:21,780
And I realized if there is nobody on
this earth that I am doing any good for

84
00:06:22,881 --> 00:06:26,720
anymore and if the two people I love most,

85
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:32,270
I am hurting.
I don't want to be here anymore.

86
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:36,530
Like I had had suicidal thoughts before,

87
00:06:36,531 --> 00:06:40,370
but this time I was sure
it went to the bathroom.

88
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,890
I took the rest of my steroids.

89
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:50,200
I snuck downstairs and there was about
a quarter bottle of vodka and a fridge

90
00:06:52,941 --> 00:06:57,860
that none of us had touched,
so I drank that with all of my pills

91
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:01,970
that went back upstairs to
my bed and I went to sleep.

92
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:07,520
I didn't want them to think it
was their fault when and if I died

93
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,850
the next morning I woke up,

94
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:17,630
I felt nothing and have a stomach ache.
I didn't have to go to the bathroom.

95
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:20,570
It was like I had never
taken the pills at all.

96
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:25,610
That was the worst feeling in the world.
After about a year,

97
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:31,130
I started getting better. My skin
started to heal up and I wasn't perfect.

98
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:34,140
I went to this one acupuncturist who said

99
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:41,230
it was because of my emotional state
that my body wasn't able to produce the

100
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:45,560
healthy bacteria.
It needed to make everything better.

101
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:50,060
Now it's five or six years later,

102
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,830
it's still hear his voice in the back
of my head. I wish I could forget,

103
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:57,503
but I'm here.

104
00:07:58,940 --> 00:07:58,980
Yeah.
