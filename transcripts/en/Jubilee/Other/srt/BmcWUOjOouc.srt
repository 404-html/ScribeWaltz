1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,170
How wasn't staring at you.

2
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:05,660
I see where I was looking at you making
sure it wasn't a dream. I was like, okay,

3
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:18,260
I'm Keyona Morrison.

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,100
I am 33 years old and
I'm a marketing manager.

5
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:27,120
My name is Cameron Morrison. I'm 33
years old and I'm a building engineer.

6
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,870
Were married for five years.

7
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:37,080
We have one and one on the way.
I'm nine months now,

8
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,990
so I should be having this baby any day.

9
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:43,643
Wow.

10
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,740
So I had just moved to La.

11
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:50,970
I had a friend in town who
was an aspiring actress.

12
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,040
She invited me to one of
her plays and we met there.

13
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,120
He kept asking me questions and looking
at me from across the room and I'm like,

14
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:06,960
Weirdo. She'll probably tell you that I'll
staring at her. But you know, I was uh,

15
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:11,580
actually trying to assure that there
was a connection. I thought there,

16
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:15,030
there might've been a connection to a,
one of the conversations she was,

17
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:19,950
she was pretty personable, easy going,
I saw you get up after party. Right.

18
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:24,630
And he kept staring at me. I wasn't
staring at you. I see where, all right.

19
00:01:24,631 --> 00:01:29,410
So one of the first day I was
wanting to show around La really, uh,

20
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:30,510
we went to Venice beach,

21
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,340
we had to kind of navigate around the
crowd and I was really impressed how well

22
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:39,060
she walked with me. And I think
that's one of the things that, that,

23
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,550
that told me I needed to
look for a second date.

24
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,200
He probably didn't tell you this part,

25
00:01:43,201 --> 00:01:45,420
but when he first picked
me up from my apartment,

26
00:01:45,421 --> 00:01:48,420
I told him the wrong address so
that he wouldn't know where I lived.

27
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,090
I know that he took me to Venice beach.

28
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:55,800
I just remember him like putting his
arm around me and us walking through the

29
00:01:55,801 --> 00:01:57,810
crowd and I just felt comfortable.

30
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:00,750
So we went to Venice beach after
I picked her up down the street.

31
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:03,360
Murphy,

32
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,010
I remember that we were walking
together like we knew each other.

33
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:13,370
We were comfortable. I think I came
home from work one day, you know,

34
00:02:13,371 --> 00:02:16,950
I'm just in the routine. Come up the
stairs, drop my stuff off at the door.

35
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,430
She was up, had the lights on and
uh, no, she wants to pray with me.

36
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:25,700
So we bought our heads and at the end
of the prayer she asked God to just

37
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,900
prepare us,
prepare our steps,

38
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:32,350
prepare me to be the father
that she was now pregnant with.

39
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:37,320
It was crazy. I found out I was on a
business trip, so I had to hold it.

40
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,280
I think I was gone for three
days. And you know, I tell my mom,

41
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,080
my sister on the phone
and then when I got home,

42
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:48,600
I had the pregnancy test.
I recorded him and his reaction,

43
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:53,190
I think I just gave it to him. He was
shocked and he just kept saying, wow,

44
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,050
wow,
you came home,

45
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:59,830
came up the stairs and I think
I just gave you the, we pray,

46
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:05,260
we prayed. And then at the end of the
prayer you ask God to, uh, oh my gosh.

47
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,160
Apparently I forget that prepared
me to be the father, you know, hey,

48
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,310
you're like,
wait a second.

49
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,840
It was pretty much everything I thought
he would be because I knew those

50
00:03:19,841 --> 00:03:24,460
qualities existed in him.
He's caring. So with Nala,

51
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:30,060
it's just on another level. He loves
the hell out of that girl. And,

52
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,400
and she loves him too.
She's strong mother.

53
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,190
I don't know how she
already knows what to do,

54
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:40,150
but it seems like she's been doing this
for a while. Yeah. That's impressive.

55
00:03:40,151 --> 00:03:43,690
I don't have doubts or reservations
about the next one coming in the world.

56
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:49,090
You're just a good dad. Like she's
got you wrapped around her finger,

57
00:03:49,091 --> 00:03:53,790
like she's going to be the spoiled little
girl because of you. That's all right.

58
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:01,940
I'm really just coming to terms with the
party being over and really mentoring.

59
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,420
Um,
a lot of time shooting myself in the foot

60
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:12,870
with my drinking. One time I
came home and you know, she,

61
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:17,530
uh, she said something
that really triggered me

62
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,673
and

63
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,690
you know, I know I yelled at her.
I don't know exactly what I say it,

64
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:26,200
but I know I was yelling at the
top of my lungs. She was fearful.

65
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:30,230
She was scared and uh,
wasn't pretty

66
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,240
definitely dealing with

67
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:38,990
Cameron's sobriety.

68
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:43,610
He's one way when he's sober
and then when he drinks,

69
00:04:43,611 --> 00:04:45,890
he's a completely different person.

70
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:51,440
He wasn't abusive at all or anything,
but it's just he changed.

71
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,560
They are things that are forgiven,

72
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:00,400
but they can't really be
forgotten without the alcohol,

73
00:05:02,331 --> 00:05:07,070
without the distractions.
He's everything.

74
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:07,821
I like,

75
00:05:07,821 --> 00:05:12,821
I know what his intentions are and
they would never to hurt me on purpose.

76
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:14,893
So,

77
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,513
okay.

78
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:23,940
Dealing with, you know, my drinking,
dealing with my smoking. Yeah.

79
00:05:23,941 --> 00:05:27,860
It just really making some,
some difficult changes with my life.

80
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:31,400
I forgave you,
but it's,

81
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:36,050
there are triggers that come up for
me and so it brings it all up again.

82
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:41,240
I'm way better at pushing them
out. I'm glad that, you know,

83
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:45,610
I have here forgiveness, you know, I
struggle with forgiving myself. You know,

84
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:48,980
I'm the one that hurts you the worst.

85
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:51,490
I know who you are

86
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,270
outside of that guy who over drink.

87
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:02,250
Well we've all done that and I feel
like since I did it in college and I've

88
00:06:03,381 --> 00:06:05,780
grown up,
like why can't you do the same thing?

89
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,270
But it just took you a
little longer to realize,

90
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,000
oh absolutely.

91
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:18,180
I see is getting old and retiring or
some kind of farm somewhere somewhere on

92
00:06:18,251 --> 00:06:19,084
the country.

93
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:25,390
I look at old couples and I think of
us like I think that Cameron and I are

94
00:06:25,581 --> 00:06:30,581
going to be one of those cute old couples
that are still enjoying life together.

95
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:36,190
I'm excited to see him evolve
as a father as well. I mean,

96
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,510
I don't know how he can get any better,
but I just,

97
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,810
I'm excited to see it
as we raise our kids.

98
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:46,830
I mentioned us on out of on
a farm somewhere, you know,

99
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:51,740
I guess. Yeah, but you know,

100
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:56,690
honestly wherever we are, it doesn't
matter as long as we were together. Yeah,

101
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:01,700
we're still walking
together. Yeah. Father God,

102
00:07:01,701 --> 00:07:03,830
we thank you for bringing us to this day.

103
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:09,170
We thank you for opening kiln and I up
to I see ourselves and to see the path

104
00:07:09,171 --> 00:07:11,000
that you've brought us down so far.

105
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:14,390
All the obstacles and hurdles
that you've gotten us over.

106
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,220
Thank you for the health of our children.

107
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:20,660
We thank you for this pregnancy and pray
for the health of the child that's on

108
00:07:20,661 --> 00:07:23,400
its way and we ask that you
just continue to be present,

109
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:28,370
get to continue to lead our way.
Amen.

110
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:34,163
Okay.

111
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:39,060
I say it's the moist were
back within a new, uh,

112
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,050
Morrison this design.
Scott Nolan Moon.

113
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,660
Ooh,
science here.

114
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:47,790
Huh?
