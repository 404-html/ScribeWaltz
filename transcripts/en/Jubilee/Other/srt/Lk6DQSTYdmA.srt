1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,830
Never have I ever kissed a girl

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:06,600
it I wanted to know

3
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:14,410
up

4
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:19,190
[inaudible]. I'm Corey brothers
or [inaudible]. My name's Rj.

5
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:23,220
You've been rather it's for 18 right?
18 years.

6
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:28,310
Now that I think about it, we don't talk
as much, but like we get each other.

7
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:33,200
All right. Never have I ever
made you clean up my mess.

8
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:34,573
Hey,

9
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,330
yeah.

10
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,970
Remember when your friend brought home
like a BB gun and we're not allowed.

11
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,080
We weren't allowed to shoot at the time.
As

12
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:50,930
I told Mom, knowing that she
directly anger towards you
because she was like, oh,

13
00:00:50,931 --> 00:00:54,290
you're the older brothers Lee out
to like be a role model and stuff.

14
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,170
Have you felt guilty about that?
I think I should

15
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:02,540
have got you in trouble, but I don't
know. Time heals all wounds, dude.

16
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:07,220
I said yes because I thought you meant
like a literal messy room in some ways.

17
00:01:07,221 --> 00:01:11,150
I don't want you to take care of my mess
if I can't be a good role model to you.

18
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:12,740
Then like

19
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,600
what's the point of me being
your older brother? Biologically,

20
00:01:16,601 --> 00:01:19,070
I'm your older brother, but I want
to be an older brother. You know,

21
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,553
okay.

22
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:26,630
Never have I ever, never have I ever
done something to fit in very to what,

23
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:29,010
what did you do to fit in?

24
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,480
So my friend was like,

25
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:34,660
oh do you don't have in this kickback
am I my house and stuff. Right.

26
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:37,240
I didn't know what a kickback
was. Right. So I want anyways.

27
00:01:37,241 --> 00:01:39,250
And I kinda like found
out while I was there.

28
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,130
I don't think of myself as wanting
to succumb to like peer pressure.

29
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,950
But I did that one time and it was,

30
00:01:44,951 --> 00:01:47,710
it was really stupid because like those
aren't even like my actual friends,

31
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,600
you know? It was just like a
bunch of people I met that night.

32
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:50,590
I know you're the older brother,

33
00:01:50,591 --> 00:01:53,430
but I'm still an older
brother to like our sisters.

34
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:55,390
I don't want to like be open
with it. Right. All right.

35
00:01:55,391 --> 00:01:57,910
I didn't want to like tell you one of the
family cause I know like stuff travels.

36
00:01:57,911 --> 00:01:58,090
Yes.

37
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:01,060
They understand that. Like
it was something that you
didn't want to do then. Yeah.

38
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:05,620
But they don't have to know that. I don't
think I've had something like yours.

39
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,030
I think it was just back in middle
school with my tight pants. Oh yeah.

40
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:14,280
Uh, never. Have I ever
lied to you? They a law.

41
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:18,430
No surprise as I feel like I've lied to
you and you knew it and then you lied to

42
00:02:18,431 --> 00:02:19,780
me. I knew it. Yeah.

43
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:24,760
I would always like come up with some
like bullshit excuse that. Oh my,

44
00:02:24,761 --> 00:02:26,380
like rising turnout or something.

45
00:02:26,381 --> 00:02:30,910
So I need you try me when I actually
just like totally forgot to ask you. Uh,

46
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,500
uh, let's see. What
have I lied to? I Dunno.

47
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:41,190
I just feel like I just try and make
myself sound better than I usually do.

48
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:48,770
Never have I ever been afraid
of the future? Three to one.

49
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:54,660
Pretty sure everyone
our age is freaking out.

50
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,530
Going in a film, it's like, I
don't really know what to do.

51
00:02:57,531 --> 00:02:58,790
I know a lot of people freelance.

52
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:02,050
I was with my friend and he told me
that the best way to get through,

53
00:03:02,051 --> 00:03:05,740
just to follow the rules, you have to
be a doctor, engineer or business major.

54
00:03:05,741 --> 00:03:09,910
Right. Those are like social
standards for kids like us.

55
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,650
And when he told like said that to me,
I was like super paranoid

56
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,150
when I got into USC is like sweet.

57
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:20,240
I know the direction that I'm going in
but I still have no idea like what I'm

58
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:20,980
supposed to do.

59
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:25,120
It's scary cause like mom and dad are
investing in us so much like everyone that

60
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:28,450
I've talked to, like it's the same
thing like no one has it figured out.

61
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:29,760
Cool, cool, cool.

62
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:38,460
Never have I ever wanted to
tell you something but didn't
to spare your feelings?

63
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:44,150
No. Countdown God. Well now okay.

64
00:03:44,151 --> 00:03:47,760
My bad feels quite awkward.
I can't think of any.

65
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,730
I mean it's all the same thing.
I know you can do better,

66
00:03:52,731 --> 00:03:54,050
you know that kind of thing.

67
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,190
Like there are things I wanted to tell
you but like I knew you already felt it

68
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:01,360
up until now. For the longest
time I thought you had
everything like sorted out.

69
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,091
Growing up with you,

70
00:04:02,091 --> 00:04:06,400
you are so optimistic about everything
and there was never a time where I felt

71
00:04:06,401 --> 00:04:09,460
like I had to tell you something.
A lot of the things I tell you anyways.

72
00:04:09,461 --> 00:04:12,550
It's just like it turns into
like this like joke are.

73
00:04:12,551 --> 00:04:14,200
We just like laugh it
off and it's like cool.

74
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:19,760
I'm like a role model to, you
know, I look up with Jaylen,

75
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:29,690
never have I ever felt like I
disappointed you in three, two,

76
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:30,613
one

77
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,670
wait, I still into your process.
I need you. You took your first.

78
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:39,630
It's like the same thing I've been
saying like whenever mom yells at me or

79
00:04:39,631 --> 00:04:41,820
whenever I feel like I messed up,

80
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:45,960
that's when I feel like I've disappointed
you and Jaylen and Kina like I just

81
00:04:45,961 --> 00:04:50,961
wanted to be this big blanket for you
guys to like be safe and I think when you

82
00:04:51,211 --> 00:04:54,360
left for college you left some
like pretty big shoes to fill.

83
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,780
You know what I mean?
And

84
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,970
it didn't feel as like super gradual.

85
00:04:59,971 --> 00:05:03,240
It just felt like all
these responsibilities were
dumped on me and it was like

86
00:05:03,241 --> 00:05:06,430
that expectation to be you like literally.
Yeah and body,

87
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:08,370
like your personality and mannerisms.
Like,

88
00:05:08,371 --> 00:05:11,670
I don't want you to like come back and
find out like her family's like super

89
00:05:11,671 --> 00:05:13,530
screwed up and stuff. You
know what I mean? Yeah.

90
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,350
Cause like you guys in shambles right
now? No, I'm just kidding. We're great.

91
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:21,550
Is that a lie? Are you guys okay?
Yeah, we're fine. Are you okay?

92
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:26,560
Are you okay? I'm killing it
here too. Yeah, I'm lit dude.

93
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,170
We were just talking about you.
Okay. The more you ask him, no more.

94
00:05:29,171 --> 00:05:32,650
I'm concerned like,
I don't think I've talked to you as much.

95
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,980
I just want to make sure that you're okay.
Keep your top like here all the time.

96
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:41,770
Okay. Okay. You guys okay?
We're great. How do you feel?

97
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:43,610
Okay.

98
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:47,810
I feel like we've both felt this way.
We just never like talked about it.

99
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,741
It's like understandable.

100
00:05:48,741 --> 00:05:51,140
Like I don't expect them to talk
to me about these kinds of things.

101
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,910
We've known each other for 18 years now,

102
00:05:52,911 --> 00:05:57,530
so I can like understand you
without having to like ask you or,

103
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:01,490
yeah. Talk about it. Hey, do you want
him to play one more question? Okay.

104
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,860
Never have I ever kissed the girl.

105
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:12,400
I wanted to. No surprise. There were
times when like I thought [inaudible].

106
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:15,170
He's like the ladies, man. I don't
know how he gets all these girls.

107
00:06:15,171 --> 00:06:18,860
He's like the silent
mysterious guy. I'm like, man,

108
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:21,560
for the longest time I've always
wanted to kiss, kiss the girl,

109
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:28,190
Dude,
you are incredible.

110
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:31,640
Look at us coming together and watching
the videos together. Such a family, right?

111
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:31,971
Yeah.

112
00:06:31,971 --> 00:06:35,080
We got more stuff for you right here to
subscribe and we have one video smooth.

113
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:40,010
We got all types of stuff. Anyway,
until next time, peace out.
