1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:05,090
It has been very easy to talk to you and
for you seem like a person who I would

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,410
have a good like day off with

3
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,400
a viral New York Times article,

4
00:00:17,401 --> 00:00:21,300
featured 36 questions that
could supposedly make any
two people falling in love.

5
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,470
We want it to see what would happen if
we ask these questions to two complete

6
00:00:25,471 --> 00:00:27,060
strangers on a blind date.

7
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,930
My name is Audrey.
I'm originally from St Louis,

8
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:35,280
Missouri and I am so single. And when
was the last time that you did it?

9
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:41,430
We're in this APP age, so you know,
I'll go on dates all the time.

10
00:00:41,431 --> 00:00:45,870
I Dunno.
But a real relationship has been awhile.

11
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,780
My name is Kelly and I'm from Atlanta.

12
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,340
My relationship status is whatever I want.

13
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,130
So I guess I'm will, I'm saying, oh,

14
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:04,510
I feel great. I had a great breakfast. Um,

15
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,650
it's beautiful outside and I'm ready
for a blind date. Let's do this.

16
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:14,380
I'm about to go on the weirdest
date I've ever been on.

17
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:26,460
Welcome to the weird date.
Oh, hello. Nice to meet you.

18
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:31,200
Nice to, I already said that. So I'll say
it again. Okay. Let's do the teeth. Okay.

19
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:36,330
I'm a little bit tasty.
Oh,

20
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:41,340
it's Kevin meal. So are we going to
do questions? I've already forgot.

21
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:46,110
Let's do it. If you are going to become
a close friend with your partner,

22
00:01:46,111 --> 00:01:49,770
please share what would be important
for him or her to know. Okay.

23
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:55,110
This is one that I'm going to say and
everybody's going to hear it and I'm okay

24
00:01:55,111 --> 00:01:56,110
with that.
Okay.

25
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:00,930
I think everybody who is my good friend
knows and accepts that I'm very gassy.

26
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:04,920
Okay. Hey, that happens.

27
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:09,930
Everybody eats, everybody fights
and it happens. It's a human thing.

28
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,130
I do a lot of them.
Your Professional. Yes.

29
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:18,270
That's what's cool. I need to know. Um,

30
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:23,600
I lose things constantly and I don't
have a wallet and I misplaced my keys,

31
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:30,240
my debit card and my license all the
time. Yeah. I have them all here today.

32
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:35,090
Wow. Yeah. Sorry. Good. It's the gassy.

33
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:40,560
Oh No. The action. What do you
value most in a friendship? Um,

34
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:44,430
giggles. Yeah. Yeah. I
just want to giggle. Yes.

35
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:47,970
It doesn't have to be more complicated
than that. You can make me laugh.

36
00:02:47,971 --> 00:02:48,990
What's laugh?
Yeah.

37
00:02:48,991 --> 00:02:52,990
I want to like almost pee my pants when
I think people from laughter. Yeah.

38
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:56,590
Not from incontinence. Um,
okay. What do you values?

39
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,650
Um,
just someone who's

40
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:03,430
chill with being themselves with you.
It's so nice.

41
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:07,240
Honesty and giggles. Yeah.
Yeah. Those two ingredients,

42
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:13,260
that's all you need. How do you feel
about your relationship with your mother?

43
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:18,300
I love her. Yeah. Good. She is awesome.

44
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:22,830
She's so kind and I wish you lived closer.
Yeah,

45
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:27,450
I know that feeling. Okay.
I have two moms. My older,

46
00:03:27,451 --> 00:03:32,130
my mom be, she is the kind of
person that everybody loves.

47
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:32,941
We automatically,

48
00:03:32,941 --> 00:03:37,320
she's like gregarious and like bright.

49
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:41,310
And then my mom and my
younger one is my birth mom.

50
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:46,150
And what is her name? If she's, she's
just mom. There's mom and mom. Mom.

51
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:51,090
Yeah.
She is like a genius.

52
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:56,300
He's really good at fixing things herself
and she's the kind of person who makes

53
00:03:56,341 --> 00:03:58,950
a lot of sacrifices for
other people, like, you know,

54
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:02,040
how did they meet with them
on a blind date? Incredible.

55
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:07,840
Name three things you and your
partner appear to have in common.

56
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,870
Okay. Let's talk about,
look at the striped shirt.

57
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,330
Black Pants.
So Alvin is checked off.

58
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:23,430
We are in arts in true,

59
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:28,270
we both would love to relax with
coffee and that's a great one.

60
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,460
That's like a very solid, yeah, yeah,

61
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,350
yeah. All right, next one then.

62
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:42,570
Oh Lord,
what is true love.

63
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,600
Okay.
Okay.

64
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:49,020
My current understanding
of what true love might be,

65
00:04:49,021 --> 00:04:54,021
it's just finding someone you can be
your full self with all the goods and the

66
00:04:54,871 --> 00:04:55,450
bads.

67
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:56,770
I totally agree.

68
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:00,610
It's like having an extension of yourself.

69
00:05:00,611 --> 00:05:03,490
You have to live with all of
the good and bads in you. Right.

70
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:07,360
And when you can like fully accept that
in somebody else and like be supported

71
00:05:07,361 --> 00:05:11,270
by them and support them through
anything, that's true. Laughs.

72
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,970
All right.

73
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:17,620
Share a personal problem
and ask your partners advice
on how she might handle it.

74
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:21,040
Okay. Ah, okay.

75
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:26,380
No problem. And I've got a few. Gosh,

76
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,710
my biggest issue right now,

77
00:05:29,711 --> 00:05:34,711
it's sort of funding the balance
between working a super demanding job.

78
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:42,720
Also finding time to simultaneously
pursue my own creative projects.

79
00:05:44,021 --> 00:05:48,340
So hard. Finding that balance
is my problem right now.

80
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:52,260
That's a very hard one. Yeah.
And I'm supposed to give
you advice. Right? I guess,

81
00:05:52,261 --> 00:05:56,940
I don't know. I think you're
doing a very normal struggle,

82
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:01,580
struggling like that.
It's only going to make you stronger.

83
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,140
Um, okay. Your personal
style problem you took mine,

84
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:12,230
you can have the same problem and
I can relate the same information.

85
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,660
I feel like it's in the exact same vein.
Okay.

86
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:20,910
But my personal problem is that I'm
worried that I don't have quite enough

87
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:27,541
direction in what I'm doing and
I'm worried that I'm floundering.

88
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:33,160
Sometimes it like crosses my mind that
like maybe I'm not working toward any

89
00:06:33,551 --> 00:06:34,384
goal right now.

90
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:39,680
That's so common for people pursuing
creative paths in any short.

91
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:44,880
But in terms of not having enough
direction, I'm sure that you do,

92
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
but I think just like finding the thing
that you want to say to the world that

93
00:06:50,371 --> 00:06:54,060
only you could say and sharing
that through your work.

94
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,480
Oh,
how do you do?

95
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,620
I'm working on it myself,
but

96
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:06,290
you of course have things that are
important to you and sort of putting those

97
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:11,291
out proudly and whatever artistic
shape that takes and standing by it.

98
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,450
And I know you can do that.
Yeah.

99
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,060
Oh,
thanks.

100
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:21,640
It's all about I want to see your
work and your performances. Yes,

101
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:25,550
we will. We can make
this continue. All right.

102
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,550
This might be the final question.
Done.

103
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:35,820
Oh, what'd you go on a second
date with your partner? Yes. Yeah.

104
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:40,030
Sounds good.
Already reached this conclusion.

105
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,580
We'll make this other thing.
I want to high five you again,

106
00:07:42,581 --> 00:07:45,000
but it's like we can do
it. Let's do it. Okay.

107
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:50,050
To good high fives today.
Were you looking at elbow?

108
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,890
I was looking for that.
Good day.

109
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:02,290
That's a wrap, folks. We
did it. Okay. He guys,

110
