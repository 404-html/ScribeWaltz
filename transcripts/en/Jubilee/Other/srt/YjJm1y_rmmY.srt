1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,860
Um, three, you look great.

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,630
A viral New York Times article featured
36 questions that could supposedly make

3
00:00:11,631 --> 00:00:13,160
any two people fall in love.

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,210
We wanted to see what would happen if
we ask these questions to two complete

5
00:00:17,211 --> 00:00:21,760
strangers on a blind date.
My name is Michael Joe.

6
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,790
Just turned 25, um, two weeks ago.

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,630
Pretty good. I'm feeling that
kind of existential dread,

8
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:35,290
um, quarter life crisis. I'm
kind of ready for something new.

9
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:37,000
Something less brief.

10
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:56,040
Hello. Hi. Hi Michael. It's
such a dramatic entrance.

11
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,350
My name is Andrew Morrison.
I have my own film production company.

12
00:01:01,351 --> 00:01:05,250
I work with clients in the
travel industry. Thank you.

13
00:01:05,251 --> 00:01:09,570
I just came from work.
This isn't like your everyday wear.

14
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:13,820
This is pretty much like what I wear to
work. So really a good fit. Good. Taylor.

15
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,650
Thank you. Thank you. Like I'm
not as, I wish I were. Yeah,

16
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:19,883
let's pour this

17
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:22,183
and

18
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:26,570
I don't think it's ready,
but I'm thirsty. The little

19
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:32,290
chairs, I guess you
don't do that with tape,

20
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,160
but I like your style.

21
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:35,483
Okay.

22
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:41,520
What do you do? Um, you want to
know that first? It's really random.

23
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:45,830
I buy rocks.
Things like kitchens,

24
00:01:45,831 --> 00:01:49,680
like countertops or like hamburger.
Yeah, sure. Kind of like that. Yeah.

25
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:56,120
Take four minutes and tell your partner
your life story in as much detail as

26
00:01:56,121 --> 00:01:56,954
possible.

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,590
You don't want to go first.
You go put the pressure on me.

28
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:02,480
I want to get to know you.
Okay.

29
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,080
Kirpan Seritos most of
my family lived in La.

30
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,880
I worked in fashion for a bit about four
years and it was on the manufacturing

31
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:14,990
side. I came to really
resent it. Really? Yeah.

32
00:02:14,991 --> 00:02:19,991
Because every negative image about like
the fashion industry is pretty true.

33
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,170
You know, that's how I found myself
buying rocks, I guess. Who Am about you?

34
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:30,330
Okay. Um, I am from a town
called Scandia in Minnesota.

35
00:02:30,331 --> 00:02:33,240
I grew up on a farm there.
I wanted to leave a lot earlier.

36
00:02:33,241 --> 00:02:35,700
I had been traveling the
world a lot with my father.

37
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,760
I would say what really kind of marked
and impacted my youth was I lost my aunt

38
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:47,960
and my father to cancer when I was kind
of ending high school and my grandmother

39
00:02:49,321 --> 00:02:54,030
had a stroke. All that kind of just
made me look at life differently.

40
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:59,090
I stopped looking at life as about just
saving up for retirement and four one ks

41
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:02,770
and Roth Iras and
structure and I was like,

42
00:03:02,771 --> 00:03:06,070
I'm going to hustle the seeds of all that.
We're um,

43
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,980
that I was an entrepreneur and
an artist or like living there.

44
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,220
Yeah.

45
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:16,640
If a crystal ball could tell you
the truth about yourself, your life,

46
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,760
the future or anything else,
what would you want

47
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,360
to know? Something I've been
thinking about a lot recently,

48
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:28,550
especially with that friendship question
is like what is the family that I'm

49
00:03:28,851 --> 00:03:33,230
going to end up with? Not too
long ago, my grandpa passed away.

50
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:38,980
The one thing that I remember one
of my family members saying was, um,

51
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:44,960
he was really lucky to have his entire
family in the area to be with him as he

52
00:03:44,961 --> 00:03:47,240
passed.
And that just got me thinking,

53
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:51,590
who are the family members that are going
to be with me at the end of my life?

54
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:56,120
Um, who are the friends I consider
my friends family as well. So

55
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,090
what you said about your Grandpa,
I mean that's, that's 100% true.

56
00:04:00,091 --> 00:04:04,410
When my dad was sick and my sisters
and I took care of him and you know,

57
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:07,170
that was something that
every day it was like,

58
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:08,970
it was almost like a song he would sing.

59
00:04:08,971 --> 00:04:12,630
He was just so grateful that we were all
there and we were like, well, of course.

60
00:04:12,631 --> 00:04:16,090
Once you've seen that, once you've
experienced it in some, to some degree,

61
00:04:16,091 --> 00:04:17,790
you realize how important that is.

62
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:25,730
Alternate sharing something you consider
a positive characteristic of your

63
00:04:25,731 --> 00:04:29,360
partner. Share a total of five items. Oh,

64
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,240
let's do it.
I want to go first.

65
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:35,960
Yeah,
I sense this sort of um,

66
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,800
compassion that you have really seems
like you care and that makes me trust you

67
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:45,170
even though I've just met you two,
I think.

68
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:51,220
I think you are brave for making a lot
of these choices you have in your life to

69
00:04:52,911 --> 00:04:55,670
follow the career paths that,
that you want.

70
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:59,150
You're making these choices and you're
following your heart and it seems like

71
00:04:59,151 --> 00:05:03,250
you have the willpower and the drive
to succeed. Three, you look great

72
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:11,210
for. I really just admire
that you are from this place.

73
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:16,240
You have that sort of glow and positive
energy that's represents Los Angeles and

74
00:05:16,251 --> 00:05:17,930
California. Hello, our sweat

75
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:22,100
glow.
And um,

76
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:26,980
not many people relax me,
but you've very relaxing,

77
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,540
very calming.

78
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:33,620
You have this groundedness to you that
I just desire but we'll never ever be.

79
00:05:34,271 --> 00:05:36,190
So I think that's such a gift.

80
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:40,930
I felt the same way about you honestly.
I'm not just like turning it around.

81
00:05:40,931 --> 00:05:44,020
Like when you first walked out, I
was like, this guy seems so chill.

82
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:46,780
I'm gonna have to ensure that
all of my Walkin's or that

83
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:51,820
long one mile space
though. No. Yeah, it was,

84
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,143
oh,

85
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:56,280
I find you extremely warm,

86
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,540
which I think is not common,

87
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:02,540
especially now hearing your story,

88
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:06,290
you definitely seem extremely
driven and I think that's awesome.

89
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:08,900
You don't just think of your
goals here and like, okay,

90
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:11,000
I'm going to start a business
so I'm going to do it.

91
00:06:11,001 --> 00:06:14,640
And you started a production company
and kind of to tie in with, uh,

92
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:19,070
the first point that I
made it seem very familiar.

93
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,333
Mm.

94
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,860
I find it fairly easy to open
up to you and you're very open,

95
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:30,190
which is, which is great. Yeah. Not
going to lie coming into this. Um,

96
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,830
I was pretty nervous. Yeah. You have
helped me realize. I'm glad you're here.

97
00:06:33,831 --> 00:06:34,760
That's really cool.

98
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,930
The final task is without speaking,

99
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:43,010
stare into each other's eyes for
four minutes, for four minutes.

100
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:47,480
So, um, let's do it. Okay.

101
00:06:58,770 --> 00:06:59,603
Hmm.

102
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:14,470
Michael is a very grounded,
empathetic,

103
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:17,890
and compassionate person.
He's a total feeler.

104
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,910
Looking at him, I would've said
he's fucking cool and dress well.

105
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,030
I want to get to know him so much more.

106
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:37,020
She's for sure kind of different from a
lot of the people I've met here in la.

107
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:39,690
Maybe I've grown accustomed to

108
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:45,950
community here and that's just kind
of what I expect everyone to be like.

109
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:51,780
He was just very different,
which I really liked.

110
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,753
Ooh,

111
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:07,230
I was so bizarre. Yeah. Really? Why?
Oh my God, I can feel the jet lag.

112
00:08:07,231 --> 00:08:10,320
No. Oh No. For like a brief minute,

113
00:08:10,321 --> 00:08:13,290
like everything got really
blurry except for your face.

114
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:15,180
I was just looking at a Monica

115
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:22,330
for now dean here and I'm glad you did
this and this inspired me to just have

116
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:27,300
more meaningful discussions with
people that I meet anywhere.

117
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:30,290
It was nice to kind of just open up to

118
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:33,880
someone you knew nothing about.

119
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,910
I would, I would definitely be
interested in a second thing, Michael.

120
00:08:40,911 --> 00:08:45,420
I think he's gonna do
great things in life. Yeah,

121
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,190
for sure.

122
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:47,023
MMM.

123
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,520
Whether it's as friends

124
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:54,050
explore something further.

125
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:01,370
This is actually kind of an amazing
experience to be flying in and meeting you

126
00:09:01,371 --> 00:09:05,480
right away. You're being like kind of
welcome. It's cool. Michael, welcome.

127
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,400
Hi, I'm Dan. Hi,

128
00:09:15,401 --> 00:09:19,090
I'm Taylor and thank you
so much for watching this
episode of tea for two and we

129
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:20,260

Thanks so much.

132
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:28,300
Okay.
