1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,240
You take one monopoly? Yeah,
I mean what did you give him?

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,880
Waterworks that ripped man.

3
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,460
Oh, grow cash. We board wants
the reference here. Go for it.

4
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:29,750
Kind of minority group.
My name is Kieran.

5
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,370
I am a senior banker.

6
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,930
The reason why I do what I do is to help
individuals with financial literacy.

7
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:42,200
You're absolutely.
My name is Amos and I'm a student,

8
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:46,460
a social media influencer
and a Christian apologist.

9
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:51,110
Wow, that's amazing. My
name is Michael Chang.

10
00:00:51,111 --> 00:00:54,680
I am a founder,
CEO of 11 recruiting.

11
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:58,660
I love finding people jobs and
creating dreams. Did a few roles for,

12
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:04,430
oh my goodness, this is no
Steve. My name is Josh Jackson.

13
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:06,590
I'm a video editor. It's
good. I love editing videos,

14
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:11,080
but doing it since I was 14 years old,
we're walking. We're just leaving.

15
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:14,710
That was pretty cool.
Goes

16
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:25,150
all right. It's 40 bucks. It's 40
bucks. You don't have a house yet,

17
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:27,810
so I didn't want the house. It's just
want to be a buck. He's window me.

18
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:30,370
I'm just trying to struggle out.
Struggling out here.

19
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:38,060
Okay, so how much would you chop off
a Lynn for? Like how much of a limb?

20
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:39,850
How about a foot? No, no,

21
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:43,910
that was [inaudible] fee and it will
be like a whole arm or the left nipple.

22
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:49,100
What? Not a less dominant
arm. Maybe a billion dollars.

23
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,890
I'd probably wouldn't, you
wouldn't owe any price? Yeah. Yeah.

24
00:01:51,891 --> 00:01:55,010
If you think about a body
part and how priceless it is,

25
00:01:55,011 --> 00:01:58,040
think about how much more precious
your life is like your soul.

26
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,633
Anyways,

27
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:08,550
I think I have to go to jail.
Are you going to jail dude? Dude,

28
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,470
you're incarcerated.
I be

29
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,740
answer this question or pay a hundred
to the bank. How much do you make?

30
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:28,600
I make 55 a year.
I think I made 24 k this past year.

31
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:33,800
May I am a student right now,
so I'm technically, um, yeah,

32
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:38,350
I, I'm a business owner, so
technically nothing. Um, uh,

33
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:43,440
but last year my w two was
$350,000. Okay. Can you talk me,

34
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,760
is it too old to be a dumpster?

35
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:49,820
Let me get your Baltic Gavin and
then you can have this. Yeah, right.

36
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,770
This is a loss for me,
but I'll hook it up and I'll help you.

37
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,860
So now you've got a double
take. I'm looking monopoly. Hey,

38
00:02:55,861 --> 00:03:00,570
don't you got to get assessed for his
decision? I am buying six houses. Oh,

39
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:04,080
why did you don't worry. You pass
go. You just give me your money.

40
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,230
I want to get my money, man. I'll
help you out once you get lower.

41
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:09,830
I told Mike the same thing.
Or are you playing to win now?

42
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:14,460
I'll just plan to be here.
The $250.

43
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:18,360
I would pay my rent. I actually
have my niece coming to visit me.

44
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:19,560
I actually thought about this.

45
00:03:19,561 --> 00:03:23,970
I was looking to donate it and it'll be
a great time to take her around and let

46
00:03:23,971 --> 00:03:28,680
her do things that she would like to do.
I probably would get some groceries.

47
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:33,070
Seriously.
Um,

48
00:03:33,071 --> 00:03:36,190
are you satisfied with the amount of
money you have right now at this point?

49
00:03:36,191 --> 00:03:39,070
Right now I'm pretty satisfied because
I'm pretty big on the whole like

50
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,690
minimalist movement. Like I
don't even have a couch or
nothing. I won't be busily.

51
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,730
Really depends on the mindset.
Right?

52
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,080
You want all this stuff or are
you kind of just like, I'm,

53
00:03:48,081 --> 00:03:51,760
I'm cool with sitting on the floor and
my crew was giving away Baltic avenue.

54
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,880
They ain't gonna let him
live that down are, you know,

55
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:58,240
I think that's going to cost the game.
Yeah. Seriously. No, no, we'll be okay.

56
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:00,580
He's the only person with
a monopoly right now.

57
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:03,880
I felt bad because he was in jail,
but we'll be okay. I'll go to jail.

58
00:04:03,881 --> 00:04:04,714
Do you want to trade?

59
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:08,490
What was the most financial lead
desperate time of your life?

60
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:09,810
How did you deal with it?

61
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:16,140
I'll go first. Uh, 2004 parents moved out.

62
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,260
So I basically got rid of,
uh, the place I was living at.

63
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,440
I literally ate TV dinners and microwave
food for like a whole year and a half.

64
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,660
I was actually 27 at that time.
Did you feel,

65
00:04:27,661 --> 00:04:30,570
because you were such an like
a low financial like area,

66
00:04:30,571 --> 00:04:34,110
did that give you like a dry Oh
fuck to like make a lot of money?

67
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:37,420
It's because I had to go through that
struggle. My emotional support was,

68
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,440
was limited. I saw was on the other
side. It was just the really good thing.

69
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:41,860
I knew I couldn't be successful.

70
00:04:41,861 --> 00:04:45,660
I knew I was going to be great at what
I'm doing. I just had to get through this.

71
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:49,230
I guess the most financially a difficult
time in my life was a pretty recently

72
00:04:49,231 --> 00:04:52,320
actually.
I was at a pretty constant freelance Gig,

73
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,450
like a thing where they would just
call me every week. It'd be like, Hey,

74
00:04:54,451 --> 00:04:55,350
can you come in these days?

75
00:04:55,351 --> 00:04:59,700
And one day they just stopped calling
so now I have to find something that's

76
00:04:59,701 --> 00:05:00,780
more like consistent.

77
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,080
Mine's was similar to Mike.

78
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,580
I was 22 I just was trying
to be a full time student,

79
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:10,330
full time work and then my grandmother
told me that my little brothers had to

80
00:05:10,331 --> 00:05:15,331
come live with me and I was already making
it on $100 a month with groceries and

81
00:05:15,341 --> 00:05:17,740
I had to come to the conclusion
that I couldn't play hero,

82
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,890
that I had to let my
grandmother know that, wow,

83
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:24,550
I thank you for raising them and continue
that. I need you to finish it for me.

84
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:28,600
It's better financially for me to take
care of myself to the bring anybody else

85
00:05:28,601 --> 00:05:31,840
with my sugar. It's awesome.
How's for standing for herself?

86
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:34,690
Thank you.
The imagery that I always say with that,

87
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:38,320
you know on the airplanes when they tell
you always put on your gas mask before

88
00:05:38,321 --> 00:05:41,790
you help others. Yeah. Oxygen
Mask you always put on their

89
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,560
gas masks.
I wouldn't be good.

90
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:50,760
I guess for me it would be my childhood
because I grew up super poor and like a

91
00:05:51,431 --> 00:05:55,180
lot of nights with no food and you know
going to sleep hungry and that's why I

92
00:05:55,181 --> 00:05:56,830
don't really idolize money or,

93
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:01,040
but rather I try to make friends and
try to hang out more. God's good.

94
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:02,310
I'm here today so you know.

95
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:05,783
Okay.

96
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:10,970
All right. Look, the three of us,
we need monopolies. He has us.

97
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,260
He has the ones we do. Yes. So we've
got to do a triple tray. So the spoof,

98
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:17,610
give him a green and he gives us,
if we give you both the green,

99
00:06:17,611 --> 00:06:20,820
so then you have monopoly. Yeah,
give a yellow. Then you'd get,

100
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:25,440
why would she listen? Yeah. The game
of monopoly is literally a month.

101
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,770
I got a big heart. Love that.
Now we're all in the game.

102
00:06:30,771 --> 00:06:33,350
Okay. All right. Now I just made
it fun. I love you for that.

103
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:34,510
We need more people in life.

104
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:45,210
What is a secret to money or success
that everybody should know to make money?

105
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:47,130
You have been willing to
be risk of money as well,

106
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:52,330
and I'm going to add to that and in
terms of not being attached to what money

107
00:06:52,731 --> 00:06:55,760
means to you,
if you disconnect that attachment to it,

108
00:06:55,790 --> 00:07:00,020
what dreams it could create,
then it opens up a lot of possibilities.

109
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:04,700
I feel like a secret to success is finding
happiness with what you got right now.

110
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:08,000
So if you're happy now and you get that
thing, and that's like a dessert meeting,

111
00:07:08,001 --> 00:07:11,060
you know, it's like, oh hey man. Yeah,

112
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,143
yeah,

113
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:19,050
yeah. He and can I pee real
quick? Okay, I'll be right back.

114
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,760
Roll the dice to highest roller,

115
00:07:20,761 --> 00:07:25,080
may dare the others to do anything to get
out of a dare. Pay $125 to the bank. Oh,

116
00:07:25,081 --> 00:07:27,770
that's good. On that dude,
you're going to bathroom. It's,

117
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:32,570
I'm only roll the dice and whoever
rolls the highest gets to create a deck

118
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:36,740
for him since he's not
here. Good. All right.

119
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:43,700
12
we made an agreement.

120
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:47,180
The highest role gets to create
a dare for you. What does it do?

121
00:07:47,181 --> 00:07:50,330
The running man for 15 seconds is the
running man the thing where you go just

122
00:07:50,331 --> 00:07:52,970
running, no running man. Running
man is an American thing.

123
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,560
It's like you come in
last place in a marathon.

124
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,490
What does it mean to be successful?
Success for me is uh,

125
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,600
having a roof over your head,

126
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:09,430
having food on the table
and most importantly having
a family and people that

127
00:08:09,431 --> 00:08:10,450
love you and you loved them.

128
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,830
To me, being successful is
alignment with your vision.

129
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:17,620
It doesn't have to be monetary or
business wise on your deathbed.

130
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:20,940
I don't think any one of us in this table
is going to be really like cherishing

131
00:08:20,941 --> 00:08:24,470
the car keys to our bins were like
the keys to our mansion. Yeah,

132
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,330
we agree with that. Yeah. Your success
is defined by the people who love you.

133
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:34,770
Wow. I like it. Didn't think
you would road so too. Okay.

134
00:08:34,771 --> 00:08:39,640
So I totally lost everything from
everything that you've gotten for 50 days,

135
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,540
so it's pretty bad.

136
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:47,160
Give him everything you own.

137
00:08:47,161 --> 00:08:51,870
If this is a reflection of how I
run my business and I'm not going

138
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:55,910
to, Hey, I'm glad I bought that house.

139
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,200
Look who came up with
40 maybe being generous.

140
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,713
Yeah,

141
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:08,510
let's cash out. It's probably his
counsel. You catch up this chart accounts,

142
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:11,670
but I'm not going to count shit.
