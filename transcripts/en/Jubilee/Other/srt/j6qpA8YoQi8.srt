1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,850
Hey does this, Stephanie
Vandenberg does this. Ana,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,700
we're going to play a game
and candid can fashion.

3
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:20,600
Um, uh, no, I am from Panama
and I moved to the lake,

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,940
become a special effects makeup artists
who have me, I'm Stephanie. Been Berg.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,890
I am a fashion designer and I'm a mother.
I heard you guys met in a peculiar way.

6
00:00:29,891 --> 00:00:31,450
Can you tell me the story of how you met?

7
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:32,410
Oh,

8
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:37,410
well we were in Panama and I was walking
down the street and I saw her and I was

9
00:00:38,531 --> 00:00:42,190
like, I really want to do her
makeup as a makeup artist.

10
00:00:42,191 --> 00:00:44,680
I saw her and to me she
was like the perfect model.

11
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:47,320
I went straight to her and I was like,
Ken,

12
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:50,530
either your makeup and let's like do
a photo shoot or something please.

13
00:00:50,531 --> 00:00:55,050
We basically set up a team and
we made an amazing photo shoot.

14
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:59,320
Yeah, that was amazing.
So who starts for anyone?

15
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,930
I go, okay, perfect.

16
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:05,270
Never have I ever guns Kimmy.
Dot.

17
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:10,070
Dye Pink dipping. I don't know.
What does that mean? I'm sorry.

18
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:13,300
When you go swimming completely naked.

19
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,750
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

20
00:01:17,751 --> 00:01:22,730
It was like when on vacation with friends.
Oh, I don't remember. So many times

21
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:26,860
maybe if I lay my own pool,
maybe I would do it.

22
00:01:26,861 --> 00:01:30,380
But like anywhere else I'm like, no. Uh,

23
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,910
never have I ever farted. Well, laughing

24
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:37,213
one, two, three,

25
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:44,120
I, I don't remember. Like I know
like if I would have done it,

26
00:01:44,121 --> 00:01:47,120
I would've never forgotten because
I would have paid as myself so much.

27
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:49,900
So since I don't have any memories
of that, I'd probably not.

28
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:54,850
That's the kind of things that happens,
like not a one time thing, you know,

29
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:57,180
it happens.

30
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:02,420
So never have I ever wanted to be famous.

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,830
So I want to create like really good
work and I want to be like the best I

32
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:14,140
possibly can in my profession.

33
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:17,440
But I'm scared of people
getting too involved with me.

34
00:02:17,441 --> 00:02:21,580
Like I still want to be able to go and
flip flops to the supermarket and no one

35
00:02:21,581 --> 00:02:23,020
caring about that.
So,

36
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,210
and know me,
it's like years ago in like,

37
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:29,880
I'm working as a model and I
wanted to get to get famous more.

38
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:33,060
Cause I think I said to I and then of
course you know by the understanding and

39
00:02:33,061 --> 00:02:33,960
with the years,

40
00:02:33,961 --> 00:02:37,080
you know you're not like searching
for this kind of things no more,

41
00:02:37,081 --> 00:02:39,900
but when you are very young
he won this kind of things.

42
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:41,631
Yes sir.

43
00:02:41,631 --> 00:02:46,370
No people have the wrong idea
about modeling and makeup.

44
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:48,830
Ooh

45
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:53,320
Yes. Oh yes. Oh you want to go first.

46
00:02:53,321 --> 00:02:58,321
Sometimes people think that makeup is
something that's superficial that has to

47
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:03,640
with vanity and it's not
true. For example, in my case,

48
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:08,710
makeup artistry is like painting,
drawing,

49
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:13,600
sculpting, et cetera. But
instead of having a blank canvas,

50
00:03:13,601 --> 00:03:15,190
your canvas is a human being.

51
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:20,430
So you are creating a living and a moving
work of art and that takes a lot of

52
00:03:21,161 --> 00:03:23,080
time and that takes a lot of effort.

53
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:26,470
But makeup can also
transform a person's life.

54
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:31,270
One time I had a client and either,
no, like she had, she had cancer.

55
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:34,600
When I finished doing her makeup,
she look in the mirror and she said,

56
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,560
today I don't feel sick.
That's powerful.

57
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:41,770
It can change the way a
person sees themselves.

58
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:45,780
That's why I believe that sometimes
people have a wrong idea of makeup.

59
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:50,260
I think, you know, like four
models mainly. We are also humans.

60
00:03:50,261 --> 00:03:53,560
You know what I mean? Oh,
well we are human beings.

61
00:03:53,561 --> 00:03:57,900
And for me starting modeling
was a way to escape. Uh,

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,650
also my family. We are
humans, you know? Okay.

63
00:04:02,651 --> 00:04:06,970
So never have I ever been jealous.
A few.

64
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,673
Um,

65
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,210
oh,

66
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:20,470
oh you, you want to, you want to know
why it's not now, but when I met you,

67
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:25,350
so this is like a very dark
topic. When I met you, uh,

68
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:27,490
I used to suffer from,

69
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:32,760
from like self image issues and eating
disorders and I saw you and I was like,

70
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:39,550
I wish I were a skinny as her.
And that's what I was,

71
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:44,551
the only thing I wanted back then I only
wanted to be skinny and I lost a lot of

72
00:04:46,631 --> 00:04:49,900
weight, a lot of weight. There
came a point where I basically,

73
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:53,380
I was eating too little, I was eating
too little and I thought that was okay.

74
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:57,820
And I was like sic row and it was the
skinniest person in the world and I was so

75
00:04:57,821 --> 00:05:02,710
happy. And then I got sick. I
felt so bad because I was like,

76
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:06,740
I thought this was going to make me happy
and I thought that this was like the

77
00:05:06,741 --> 00:05:10,060
ideal.
Then my body is rejecting this weight,

78
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:15,090
my buddy is rejecting this lifestyle
and this behavior and I analyze like my

79
00:05:16,871 --> 00:05:21,220
priority should be my health no
matter what and I'm healthy now.

80
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:26,350
And I'm like, Oh my God, you look
so pretty. You look so full of life.

81
00:05:26,351 --> 00:05:31,180
And I'm like still trying to accept it.
You know? It's not easy, but at least,

82
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:35,140
at least now I'm like, this is the
right thing. This is the right thing.

83
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:38,920
So yeah,
that's basically what happened.

84
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:42,910
And I'm so glad that I finally
could grow out of that.

85
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:48,300
Yeah, I'm glad. Yeah,
because you're shining,

86
00:05:48,301 --> 00:05:52,020
you don't need to
to be less.

87
00:05:52,021 --> 00:05:55,550
You'd be just to be you and a half has
no price. You know what I mean? Yeah.

88
00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:00,740
I had exactly the same one. I was
very young, I was 15 and I was,

89
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,270
I was probably a seeking for attention
or I don't know what I was exactly

90
00:06:05,271 --> 00:06:06,230
seeking for.

91
00:06:06,231 --> 00:06:10,880
I had troubles with my mom and I try
with my father and my stepmother was

92
00:06:10,881 --> 00:06:14,570
extremely controlling, manipulative
and all that. I was terrible.

93
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:18,200
I think what we all want all
to be so skinny and blah blah.

94
00:06:18,201 --> 00:06:21,320
But I think we are trying to to,
I don't know,

95
00:06:21,321 --> 00:06:26,210
there's a name motional problem. There
isn't a problem inside of us, you know,

96
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,630
and I'm, I'm happy that you
accept yourself the way you are.

97
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,650
I had to accept myself and when I
accepted I, everything was okay.

98
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:36,870
The next one,
yes or no,

99
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:39,280
I mess up a lot.

100
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,220
Okay.
Yes,

101
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,070
of course.
Yes.

102
00:06:46,071 --> 00:06:51,071
And we learn about an hour messing up
basically from all what we are doing.

103
00:06:52,001 --> 00:06:54,320
Yes. And we learn, we learn willow.

104
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:57,800
I feel that I take a
lot of risks in my life.

105
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:02,660
Like I do a lot of things that are very
risky and it's not always going to end

106
00:07:02,661 --> 00:07:06,230
up how you want it to and it's
not always going to end up well.

107
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,540
Yeah,
I miss a ball.

108
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:12,190
So because I put myself in in really
dangerous situations, you know,

109
00:07:12,191 --> 00:07:14,410
like I went to Panama like this,
you know,

110
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:19,680
I know that I invest a lot also in people.
I get emotionally invested a lot.

111
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,160
I get heartbroken,
but you know what I lived with,

112
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:24,900
I had to leave and live it to the fullest.

113
00:07:24,901 --> 00:07:29,310
I live at 100% so yes,
I miss a lot,

114
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:34,380
but it's, my life is like really
full and I really love. Exactly.

115
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,310
You know what I mean? Exactly.
Oh my God. Yay for them.

116
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:44,640
That is so yes or know your partner
knows how truly amazing they are.

117
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:47,760
Yes or no.
That's

118
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,833
Si.

119
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,440
Yeah. I think, you know,

120
00:07:55,830 --> 00:08:00,570
I feel that you know how amazing you
are because you've been through so much.

121
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,030
It doesn't matter how hard it is, you
always choose you. So you always see,

122
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,290
know how amazing you are
and how much you were worth.

123
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:11,130
And I really admire and respect
that of you because like in my case,

124
00:08:11,131 --> 00:08:14,490
it took me forever to really choose me,

125
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,980
but for me too, it takes
me forever. You know,

126
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:23,000
it's not a mall little by little,
but um, yeah, I know that you,

127
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:28,010
you know, so, oh, how amazing
you are. You're very positive.

128
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:30,200
It's hard to find positive people.
Trust me.

129
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:34,760
No, and it was hard for me
to be like five years ago.

130
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:38,780
People wouldn't say that of me.
Like I used to be really,

131
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:42,560
really depressed and really
anxious. Yeah. And I,

132
00:08:42,561 --> 00:08:44,840
it makes me really happy
that a person that,

133
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:49,990
that found me like later in the future
would see me this way because it means

134
00:08:50,361 --> 00:08:54,440
that I truly have changed and that's
everything that I ever worked for.

135
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,950
I'm glad I met you.

136
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,303
Yeah,
me too.

137
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,230
What's up jubilee fam.
