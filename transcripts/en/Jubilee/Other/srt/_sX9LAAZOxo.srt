1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,890
The only thing I ever really wanted
in my life was to be a mother.

2
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:07,400
That's the one thing I didn't get to them.

3
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,120
It was 24.

4
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,670
I woke up one morning and my bed was
completely soaked and I thought I'd peed

5
00:00:23,101 --> 00:00:26,460
the bed.
I was four and a half months pregnant,

6
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:32,610
but when I called the doctor, he had me
come in and my amniotic sac and broken,

7
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,640
I didn't know what to do.
I couldn't eat,

8
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,740
I couldn't sleep and I
couldn't stop crying because
nobody tells you when you're

9
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:44,670
young. There's a 20% chance that
you could have a miscarriage.

10
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:47,100
My marriage didn't work out.

11
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:51,780
A lot had to do with how hard it
is for a marriage to lose a child.

12
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,660
So that was my first miscarriage

13
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:59,550
and I moved to Mexico
and I got married again.

14
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:01,740
I got pregnant again

15
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,630
and I knew enough to double check
because I'd had a miscarriage.

16
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,750
So I went in and they told me that,
um,

17
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,780
I had what's called an incompetent cervix
and that just means that your cervix

18
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,350
doesn't stay shut.
That was pregnant for five months.

19
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:23,160
The doctor said to me
as I was miscarrying,

20
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,290
have you had an abortion?

21
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,970
Pretty much insinuating that maybe it
was my fault that I was having these

22
00:01:29,971 --> 00:01:30,804
problems.

23
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:37,340
That was 1995 and in 1996 I got
pregnant again with my daughter,

24
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:45,750
feral, feral. Alma means wild soul,

25
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,630
and I was pregnant five and a half months.

26
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:51,060
Every time it got to be a little bit more.

27
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,930
So the next time when I went in
and I knew I was going to lose

28
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:57,443
Pharrell,

29
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:02,370
I refused to let the baby out until
they promised to let me see her.

30
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:08,240
I moved again and I was living in the
Caribbean and in 1998 I got pregnant with

31
00:02:09,631 --> 00:02:14,631
Aiden and somehow I knew it
was a boy from the beginning,

32
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:17,430
so I had already named

33
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:22,170
Aiden means fiery one,

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,730
and my husband had already left.

35
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,070
By the time I found out it was pregnant,

36
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,470
he'd already decided he
wasn't going to stay,

37
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,130
even though I'd

38
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:42,110
already had three miscarriages and I knew
that being pregnant was a risk for me

39
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:47,610
and both physically and emotionally

40
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,213
I couldn't.

41
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,630
I couldn't not try.

42
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:59,780
When you're pregnant you
can't help but hope, hope

43
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:06,160
you imagine what your child will do
and the things that they'll have.

44
00:03:06,161 --> 00:03:11,161
B and I didn't tell anyone I was pregnant
because I thought for sure that I

45
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:16,591
wouldn't be able to keep the baby when
the doctor told me that I should not work

46
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:22,740
and I refused and I thought that if I
didn't give everything of myself up and I

47
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:26,980
kept working,

48
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,340
that if it didn't work out

49
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,190
might not hurt so much

50
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,550
and I was six months pregnant and
I was getting my regular checkups.

51
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,160
I was excited

52
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,510
and the doctor let me know that
something was wrong with Aiden.

53
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,780
My son had a rare genetic disorder.

54
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,590
They'd caused his kidney's
not the function properly.

55
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:01,080
It was going to toxify my system and
there was a high risk that I would die.

56
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:04,710
I needed to terminate the pregnancy
because the baby was going to suffocate in

57
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:06,450
utero and I was dead.

58
00:04:06,451 --> 00:04:11,451
I went to see a specialist
that I had seen before

59
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,760
and they told me the same thing.

60
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:21,150
He wouldn't be able to survive and
they just didn't even want me to leave.

61
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,360
They wanted me to just
take care of it right there

62
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,790
and I refused.
I didn't care.

63
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:34,710
I wanted so bad that there was
something that they could do

64
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:41,810
to save my son and I was
willing to die for that,

65
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:46,830
but I couldn't,
that wasn't going to fix the problem.

66
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:48,890
Okay.

67
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:53,120
It didn't matter what I was willing to
give up. My Mother didn't know what to do.

68
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,170
She was a nurse and she still
didn't know what to say.

69
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,620
So I left him,

70
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:04,070
take my stitches out
and they induced labor.

71
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:10,440
When I made the decision that I would
let the doctors do what they wanted,

72
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:15,180
I felt so guilty.
I felt

73
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:21,780
like I was giving up my child.

74
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,350
I don't really can't think
of anything worse to do.

75
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:31,380
I remember thinking that
I wish that my labor more,

76
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:34,080
I just wanted to feel something

77
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:40,880
because I felt so numb and Aiden was born

78
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:46,650
and they had forgotten to tell
me that he would be alive.

79
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,530
He was
considered a live birth,

80
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,700
so they had to wait
and you know,

81
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:00,650
do all the things you do to a new
baby and then they wrapped him up.

82
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:04,760
When they placed Aiden on my chest,

83
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:08,260
he was struggling and I heard his prayer.

84
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:14,930
It felt like funder to me.
It was definitely

85
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:19,010
wanted him to open his eyes so bad.

86
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I want it to be able to look in her eyes.
No,

87
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:33,170
but he was loved. I need for life
for about an hour and 40 minutes.

88
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,410
He took his last breath.

89
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:46,140
I felt like my heart stopped and I had
him cremated and I feel back to the

90
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:52,841
Caribbean and I sat in the
closet in my room and cry.

91
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:58,040
There was nothing to do to come from me.
It's one of those things I'm like,

92
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:59,390
but there's nothing to be sad.

93
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:05,330
There's nothing that's going to make it
better for so many years afterwards I

94
00:07:05,331 --> 00:07:10,331
would go to visualizations or meditations
or anything to try to be a better

95
00:07:12,651 --> 00:07:17,030
person. A lot of times they'll
tell you to visualize your,

96
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:22,100
you know, your pelvic bowl, your girdle
as like this golden orb of light.

97
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:23,660
And for many,

98
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:29,380
many years what I imagined it was
bio waste and something gone rotten.

99
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,700
I guess that's how I thought of my womb.

100
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:44,110
I think maybe the truth is I
have never fully grieved hidden.

101
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:53,010
Maybe that's why I'm here today.
Almost 20 years later,

102
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:54,941
I've been very lucky.

103
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:59,941
I have a lot of nieces and nephews and
I run a nonprofit that provides arts

104
00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:04,020
education to children,

105
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:08,880
and I get to use all my skills and
something I'm really passionate about.

106
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:14,750
So I came today to celebrate my
four children and honor them,

107
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,740
and maybe the owner,

108
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:23,580
the 10 years of my life
I spent invested in that.

109
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,590
Most people in my life don't even know
that I've been pregnant four times,

110
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:34,290
but every once in awhile
I get a mother's Day card.

111
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:40,230
Someone
who knows me and loves me,

112
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:46,020
and it's
beautiful

113
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:50,100
and painful at the same time.
