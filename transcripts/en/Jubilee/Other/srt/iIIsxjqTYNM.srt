00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,450
Every day,
youtube receives over 2 billion views.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,800
Imagine if just 1% of those
views inspired people to do good.

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:11,850
Now imagine if one penny was
donated for each of those fuse.

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,620
Enter the jubilee project.
For every video we make,

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,580
we recruit sponsors to donate a penny
for each view the video receives.

6
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:24,210
So by simply watching the video,
you're not only learning about the issue,

7
00:00:24,211 --> 00:00:26,520
but also helping to
raise money for a cause.

8
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:29,250
But we can't stop there.

9
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:34,080
Our vision is to create an online hub for
nonprofit organizations to raise funds,

10
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:38,340
spread awareness, and share best practices
through their own inspiring videos.

11
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:41,160
Verizon's $5,000 grants.

12
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,870
We'll make the realization of our vision
possible and through their wireless

13
00:00:45,871 --> 00:00:49,380
technology people around the world,
we'll be able to stream these videos,

14
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,960
raise money for nonprofit organizations,

15
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,250
and make a lasting impact
around the world. After all,

16
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:00,180
did you believe project beliefs
that doing good is contagious?
