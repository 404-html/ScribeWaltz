1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,980
Are you totally nervous too? Oh
yeah. On like dying right now.

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:09,660
A viral New York Times article featured
36 questions that could supposedly make

3
00:00:09,661 --> 00:00:11,190
any two people fall in love.

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:15,270
We wanted to see what would happen if
we ask these questions to two complete

5
00:00:15,271 --> 00:00:20,260
strangers on a blind date.
I'm Danny. I am single.

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,670
I've never really been in a relationship,
but um,

7
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,280
what I'm looking for an in
person. I Dunno, just fun

8
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:33,820
at this moment. I'm really
scared actually, but like,

9
00:00:33,821 --> 00:00:36,840
excited, nervous. Hopefully my
hands don't sweat or something.

10
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:50,670
Hi, I'm Danny. Andrew,
nice to meet you too.

11
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:55,280
I'm Andrew. I'm right now I'm just
trying to meet people and you know,

12
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:59,390
have a general idea of what type of
person that would like to meet but not

13
00:00:59,391 --> 00:01:03,060
trying to put on any blinders
and what can I TV like, um,

14
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:08,630
peppermint. Peppermint
is fun. Are you excited?

15
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,720
I'm excited and nervous. Yeah, me too.

16
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:18,390
Would you like to be famous and in
what way? No, no. Never really. No,

17
00:01:18,391 --> 00:01:19,224
I don't think so.

18
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:24,470
I feel like that would be like so much
pressure to have to like be something for

19
00:01:25,201 --> 00:01:29,640
everyone. I think you'd have
to be something for everyone
when she, no, not really.

20
00:01:29,641 --> 00:01:32,930
I mean, I wouldn't, I wouldn't feel
like obligated to be famous for,

21
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:36,220
I don't know.
Um,

22
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,690
I guess be famous for myself or
be famous for something I'm done.

23
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:43,140
I brought value like a famous singer.
I mean,

24
00:01:43,141 --> 00:01:46,560
it'd be cool to be talented
like that. Right. But um, no,

25
00:01:46,561 --> 00:01:48,120
I wouldn't want to change for people.

26
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,050
I feel like obligated it be who they
wanted me to be. If they like you,

27
00:01:52,051 --> 00:01:55,500
they like you. If they don't, they don't.
Yeah, I get that it got some tea. Yeah,

28
00:01:55,501 --> 00:01:59,400
that'd be great. It's that Steve
Know. I don't know if it is,

29
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,640
does it taste pepper many at all?
Is it just straight water?

30
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:07,360
It's just nice warm water. You want to
pour it back in or is that weird? Is that,

31
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:08,453
I don't think so.

32
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,620
It's going to go to all over or are
you totally nervous too? Oh yeah.

33
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:16,350
On like dying. Right. It's okay.

34
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:22,240
If a crystal ball could tell you the truth
about yourself, your life, the future,

35
00:02:22,241 --> 00:02:27,040
or anything else, what would you want
to know? Hold on. I want to know.

36
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:32,380
I would want to know who
and when I get married.

37
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:36,280
Really? Yeah. You would want to know
that. Yeah. That's cool. What about you?

38
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,780
What would you want to know? I don't know
that I'd want to know anything really.

39
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:41,450
Yeah,

40
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:44,910
like just being surprised by life and I
wouldn't want to know when I was going

41
00:02:44,911 --> 00:02:47,620
to die. No, I get it. Like
some people can sometimes,

42
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,600
like if you know you're going to die,

43
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:53,950
like you can really truly live because
you know you've got like limited time,

44
00:02:53,951 --> 00:02:55,990
but I'm not sure I would choose that.
Yeah.

45
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,900
I think it would change too much
how I would live. Like it wouldn't,

46
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,681
you wouldn't really live.

47
00:02:59,681 --> 00:03:03,190
You would be so focused on like
getting things done before. Yeah. Yeah.

48
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,710
I'll let you ask that. My five. All
right. I'm going to find a good one.

49
00:03:05,711 --> 00:03:09,850
Hence it doing this again. I'll see. Oh,
there we go. There we go. Crashed it.

50
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:15,220
I like your little sayings.
Crushed it sick. It's really
cool. It's very San Diego.

51
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,133
Cheers.

52
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:23,170
What roles do love and affection
play in your life? Oh Gosh. Yeah.

53
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,050
I think I get a lot of love and affection
from like my family and my close

54
00:03:29,051 --> 00:03:33,020
friends. So I don't know.
That's like a weird to ask.

55
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,480
Like what roles did they play?

56
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,190
Like a big one I guess for me cause
I like right now I'm so new to La.

57
00:03:39,191 --> 00:03:43,930
Like I don't have anybody here yet.
I know I will.

58
00:03:43,931 --> 00:03:48,300
But like what would be fun? I don't open
up easy. No. It's hard for me to get team.

59
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:49,870
Like it's not hard for
me to get to know people.

60
00:03:49,871 --> 00:03:51,760
Like I get to know people
really well and quickly,

61
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,270
but it's hard for me to really get to know
people. Like it takes a while. Exactly.

62
00:03:55,271 --> 00:03:59,260
Yeah, I get that. And I work all the
time. So right now I'm a personal trainer.

63
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,850
I work in Beverly Hills
as a personal trainer.

64
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,390
It's fun giving people to the point
of where like they fall in love with

65
00:04:04,391 --> 00:04:07,980
themselves. That's better than
they need us job. That's awesome.

66
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:11,040
That's really cool. I like you're
finding fulfillment in that too. Yeah.

67
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,500
Cause like not a lot of people
get to do that, you know,

68
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:17,580
find fulfillment in their jobs and I'm
young enough to where I can figure it out.

69
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:20,220
Yeah, totally. What was the
question? I don't remember

70
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:22,980
complete this sentence.

71
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,140
I wish I had someone with
whom I can share like

72
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:30,460
I want to just my life with.

73
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:34,660
It's like somebody that is always there
for you and you can like come home if

74
00:04:34,661 --> 00:04:37,020
you ever had a bad day
at work and be like,

75
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,600
this thing happened and they
just kind of are there for you.

76
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:44,710
The good and the bad thing.
Like, yeah. What about you?

77
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:51,350
Why cooking? Rarely. Oh my God. You Cook.
I'm a huge cook. I cook all the time.

78
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:54,850
What's your favorite food
and chicken popper? Gosh,

79
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:59,660
I saw Hungarian dish. I guess
my dad's family was. Yeah,

80
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:03,590
but it's like a chicken and like a
pep Rica grabby or love pepper gun.

81
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:06,050
It's so good. Yeah. I'm
gonna have to figure it out.

82
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:10,510
I can make it for you sometime.
I'll be down. Let's do it.
So cook off the we shut.

83
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:11,780
That'd be fun.

84
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:15,590
Tell your partner something
you like about them already?

85
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:20,360
Um,
I feel like you have a very like,

86
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:25,040
calming presence and I really enjoy that
where it's like I'm not as stressed.

87
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:29,590
That's good. Yeah. I'm super nervous so
it doesn't really come off. I feel like.

88
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:33,720
Yeah. I feel like my face is like
seizing up because I'm so nervous. No,

89
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:36,580
you seem very like chill and like that.
Yeah.

90
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,110
I was gonna say like you seem
very like relaxed and easy going,

91
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:42,810
which is not something I've
run into in La at all. Really.

92
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:46,480
Like after the first couple of weeks I
was like not going give me them to be

93
00:05:46,481 --> 00:05:51,270
here. Like it's just gonna be hard. Yeah,
you're very genuine. That's what it is.

94
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:55,080
Okay. It's genuine. It was nice.
Really. I don't know. Real,

95
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:59,750
which is so hard because I feel like la
is a city that worships everything and

96
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:03,810
how I use nothing. Yeah. Gosh.

97
00:06:03,811 --> 00:06:08,220
Final task without speaking. Stare into
each other's eyes for four minutes.

98
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:12,960
Four minutes. That's a
long time. Oh my gosh.

99
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:17,130
Okay.
We'll you for four minutes pretty easily.

100
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:20,410
We can't talk while you're looking
at each other for four minutes.

101
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:23,230
It's a challenge. I'm always
down for a child. Oh my God.

102
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,650
I don't think anybody's ever
looked at numbers. 40 minutes.

103
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:48,860
Yeah.
Okay.

104
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:59,260
I was definitely really,
really, really, really, really,

105
00:06:59,261 --> 00:07:04,261
really nervous and I got a lot less
nervous and it was very different than I

106
00:07:05,201 --> 00:07:07,390
expected.
She was really cool.

107
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:13,580
She's like super pretty.
I feel like a lot of it was,

108
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,620
I was like, wow, this guy's really
attractive. Sweet, down to Earth,

109
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:23,300
just generally nice person.
Then I was thinking, wow,

110
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:27,650
nobody's ever looked at me this
long or like this ever I think.

111
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,930
And it felt really nice.

112
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,760
I felt like everything she
was was like real. Hmm.

113
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:44,503
I like that.

114
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,720
That was a lot easier.

115
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:05,180
It went so good. She's like,
beautiful. So there's that

116
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:11,090
and he's so nice. So I was like,
really? That was really fun.

117
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:15,190
They're probably gonna ask us like,
what'd you go out again? But yeah.

118
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:18,760
Should we run it for him?
And I kind of expected it to be like,

119
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:21,820
you guys want to go on a second
date? Sure. Yeah, let's do it.

120
00:08:21,821 --> 00:08:24,880
And then like follow me on
Instagram. Cool. Here's my handle.

121
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,360
And then like never talk again
like our pictures occasionally,

122
00:08:28,361 --> 00:08:33,190
but like I don't get a feeling like
that is what's going to happen.

123
00:08:33,191 --> 00:08:36,940
So we'll see. I might be totally wrong.
I've totally misread this, but we'll see.

124
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,140
Do you want to go out again
again? I would love to. Yeah. Um,

125
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:44,110
I have a day off Saturday. I have Saturday
off. You want to do something? Yeah,

126
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:48,530
we say, okay, we should do the hike to
the Hollywood sign. Oh yeah. I'm sorry.

127
00:08:48,531 --> 00:08:51,200
I feel like that's like a very
like, hey, welcome to la thing.

128
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,070
Rolling.
Okay.

129
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:00,690
Hey guys. Hi. So this is our first date.

130
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:04,520
Second date. The second day technique
is the first day was bill. All right.

131
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,280
Technically second day we're going
to go hiking on the Hollywood sign,

132
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:12,390
but it was like a hundred degrees, so
that was a no go. So we went to the beach,

133
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:16,320
flip the camera around as a foot
around. We'll just go like, okay.

134
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:21,180
They have those in California.
Apparently.

135
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:25,890
I've been told allegedly we're
not sure yet. Anyway, yeah,

136
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:30,060
that's, that's it. There
we go. Thanks. Bye.

137
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:32,200
Yeah.
