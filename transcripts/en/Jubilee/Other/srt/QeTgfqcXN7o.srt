1
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:03,370
I've always wanted to
drive across the country.

2
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:10,440
I just never thought I
quit my job to do it.

3
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:22,140
Let me back up
as long as I can remember,

4
00:00:22,141 --> 00:00:24,300
I wanted to make films,
tell stories,

5
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,930
but having traditional parents
that wasn't safe for them.

6
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:33,040
You know the meme that goes, Hey dad, I
want to be an actor, and he says, son,

7
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,710
it's pronounced doctor.
That was my life.

8
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:40,480
So I took the traditional route and
studied computer science on the side.

9
00:00:40,481 --> 00:00:42,550
I made films,
tried to make a difference,

10
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:48,220
but ultimately I took the job that every
parent can brag about at dinner parties

11
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:52,480
coming out of college, I took a job
thinking I would change the world, help.

12
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:55,510
I thought I was the
change at the beginning.

13
00:00:55,511 --> 00:00:58,270
I made the most of every day
and it was novel and exciting.

14
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,760
I was working with interesting people
and I made it my mission to learn

15
00:01:03,761 --> 00:01:08,080
something new. Every day I had a spark,

16
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:12,490
learn, innovate, fail, repeat,

17
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:25,710
creepy.
But over time

18
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:28,620
things started to change.

19
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,080
The novelty was gone

20
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:38,550
and my life became routine.

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:51,850
I drank the same coffee,
made the same calls,

22
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:53,980
took the same route to work

23
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,230
each day was a copy of itself.

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,140
One day while I was working,

25
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:09,880
I came across this design website
and had a list of rules, life rules.

26
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,310
I started reading them.

27
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:17,210
Rule number two 33 never fucking so

28
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:24,960
well.
Number one 68 make a fucking difference.

29
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:26,323
Ooh,

30
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:34,200
we're on number two oh five
get in over your fucking head.

31
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:41,940
Rule number 58
is your fucking hang out.

32
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,263
Okay.

33
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:56,360
Those rules that could back to
me every day since I read them

34
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,060
my whole life,
I tried to live by those rules.

35
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,280
I had broken every fucking one.

36
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:17,210
When I first started working, I thought
it was going to make a difference.

37
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:18,440
Okay?

38
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,170
And now I realized I was
just another employee,

39
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:23,843
nothing number.

40
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,470
I didn't want to wake up at the end of
my career realizing that all they did was

41
00:03:32,471 --> 00:03:33,304
survive.

42
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,500
Just another drop in the bucket who
went along to pay off his mortgage is

43
00:03:40,501 --> 00:03:44,890
student debt.
So I finally did it.

44
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:51,430
I pack my stuff,
closed out my projects and gave my notice.

45
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:55,983
I quit.

46
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,230
Trust me.
It's much easier said than done.

47
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,293
Okay?

48
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:15,350
Honestly,
I'm not looking to be happy.

49
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:19,110
Some days I'm miserable in aching.

50
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,400
I'm interested in,
and that's where the living room,

51
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:26,303
right

52
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:37,730
as I drive across the country, I'm going
to places far outside my comfort zone.

53
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Places I've never heard
of. Small towns, people,

54
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,873
they're countless stories,

55
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:54,200
landscapes I never knew existed.
Sunrises and sunsets.

56
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:01,940
I sleep in the car on
the road in $20 motels.

57
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:10,770
Breathing air is so fresh.
It makes my heart race

58
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:15,960
at times. It's grueling and
I love every moment of it.

59
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:56,620
I've always wanted to tell stories
about real people that changed lives,

60
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:58,790
and I'm going to do just that.

61
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:05,750
My name is Tamra Chavon and I'm out to
tell the stories of those who are finding

62
00:06:05,751 --> 00:06:09,710
their own way. The ones who, who've
swam upstream for what they believe in,

63
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:13,370
the ones who left the life of
safety for something greater.

64
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:19,010
The ones who were cast aside only to
make their own path, the innovators,

65
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:24,320
the trendsetters,
some might call them the crazy.
