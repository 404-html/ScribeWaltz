1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,120
Asian stereotypes and
jokes are so played out.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,090
It's the same shit that we've
heard for the last 50 years.

3
00:00:06,091 --> 00:00:08,750
Like miss me with that.
It's so boring. It, yeah.

4
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:09,643
This point,

5
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,160
is it better than mirror

6
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:33,530
three two

7
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:38,640
no.

8
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,770
Wait, describe American
food though. I just,

9
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:50,040
I just thought of hamburgers and like
a loaf and meatloaf and mashed potatoes

10
00:00:51,161 --> 00:00:53,800
and stuff. So I'm like, of course
Asian foods better than that.

11
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,280
I was just denied Asian
food for a long time.

12
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,680
My mom wanted to be Caucasian.

13
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:04,710
She wanted me to grow up as a white person
and I think I was maybe 10 or 11 when

14
00:01:04,781 --> 00:01:09,570
I truly like experienced Korean cuisine.
Oh my God,

15
00:01:09,571 --> 00:01:10,860
this is amazing.

16
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,170
What's she saying? I find a really
common cause when I grew up, you know, I,

17
00:01:14,171 --> 00:01:15,670
my parents were boat people from Vietnam.

18
00:01:15,671 --> 00:01:19,750
Like they wanted us to assimilate as
much as possible and not be made fun of.

19
00:01:19,751 --> 00:01:22,990
So I love Asian food too.
I am, but I'm from Texas,

20
00:01:22,991 --> 00:01:27,040
so I grew up in like chicken fried steak
and biscuits and all kinds of stuff.

21
00:01:27,041 --> 00:01:28,270
So I fucking love marriage.

22
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:33,023
Wow.

23
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,280
Three, two. Wow.

24
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:48,570
My Dad doesn't care.
He's happy no matter if I'm happy.

25
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:51,540
My mom never specifically said it,

26
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:56,541
but it was almost like if I don't
bring home a Korean or a Caucasian,

27
00:01:56,951 --> 00:02:00,640
which is her preference, like I don't
know if she's going to disown me.

28
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:05,470
I don't know what will she kind of push
away a little bit from me and I don't

29
00:02:05,471 --> 00:02:08,320
want that. My parents,
at one point in time,

30
00:02:08,321 --> 00:02:11,590
we're very happy like you need to
marry like a Vietnamese person,

31
00:02:11,591 --> 00:02:14,050
but as I got older,
I understood why for them,

32
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:16,990
because it's more about we just wanna
be able to relate to the person that

33
00:02:16,991 --> 00:02:19,600
you're actually with so we
can talk to them too. For me,

34
00:02:19,601 --> 00:02:23,260
it's really interesting because I'm
actually married to a black woman.

35
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:28,090
I'm Chinese Malaysian,
but I grew up with a white father,

36
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,980
like white people were
definitely always an option,

37
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:33,850
but then you know other groups
of people, it's like, well,

38
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,800
we're not really sure that
they're like that. Great.

39
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,600
That often seems to be the case.

40
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:41,440
It's like you can date white or Asian
and and everyone else off the table for

41
00:02:41,441 --> 00:02:42,274
some reason.

42
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:43,470
Yeah.

43
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:48,040
Asian stereotypes are three.

44
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,750
Two wow

45
00:02:55,730 --> 00:03:00,310
are funny. I like, oh wait,

46
00:03:00,311 --> 00:03:03,700
somewhat disagree.
We're not judging you.

47
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,040
Making in your head during my head is

48
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:12,110
like stereotypes are a reflection of
perceived behavior and also I write comedy

49
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:20,930
and so I'm constantly thinking of ways
to maybe subvert a stereotype to get a

50
00:03:22,381 --> 00:03:22,651
laugh.

51
00:03:22,651 --> 00:03:27,651
I feel like it's always dangerous though
because you never know if the joke is

52
00:03:28,051 --> 00:03:29,580
going to be perceived as like,

53
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:33,240
oh they're making fun of the stereotype
or the reinforcing the stereo

54
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:36,770
tight, but even then you're saying like
the stereotype itself is not funny,

55
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:40,220
but you're some version of it is okay,

56
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,620
so maybe I'll move down.
See

57
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:49,260
I think I'm just like tired of like
Asian stereotypes and jokes are so played

58
00:03:49,261 --> 00:03:53,490
out. It's the same shit that we've heard
for the last 50 years and like American

59
00:03:53,491 --> 00:03:57,720
culture than like miss me with that.
It's so boring at this point.

60
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,100
I don't find it funny.
Well,

61
00:03:59,101 --> 00:04:04,101
I totally understand from another
point of view how that's absolutely

62
00:04:04,141 --> 00:04:09,060
inappropriate for from a personal
level. I'm not offended, I'm not hurt.

63
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:13,770
Some of them are like, yeah, that's kind
of true. What's an example? I guess?

64
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,840
Yeah,
actually I might move again.

65
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,590
You don't like for
instance me as a Korean,

66
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:23,550
like if I were to say something about
like how I feel like a lot of Koreans

67
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:27,370
behave like Koreans love uh,

68
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,040
k pop like boy bands.

69
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:33,150
It could be funny and it's not
necessarily an offensive stereo

70
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:37,670
but the growing up with like Asian men
have small penises and they'll all sorts

71
00:04:37,671 --> 00:04:39,920
of other emasculating kind of stereotypes.

72
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:43,880
Those kinds of stereotypes play into
like why can't I be the love interest

73
00:04:43,881 --> 00:04:46,550
because I have a small penis
but I don't actually know that.

74
00:04:46,551 --> 00:04:49,420
And why does it matter? Well you're
talking about is like a stereotype.

75
00:04:49,421 --> 00:04:52,490
It's been put upon Asians by non Asians.

76
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,770
If we agents want to talk about like
subcultures and Asia and like make fun of

77
00:04:55,771 --> 00:04:59,720
shit totally down. Might find it
funny to see how the joke is totally.

78
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,270
I guess like when you say when,

79
00:05:01,271 --> 00:05:03,800
when the statement is Asian
stereotypes are funny.

80
00:05:03,801 --> 00:05:08,270
I'm often thinking western
stereotypes about Asians. I'm like no,

81
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:11,040
it's not funny.
Okay.

82
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,970
Asian people easier.

83
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:17,860
Three.
Two.

84
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,293
Why?

85
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:26,460
When did you say it has an easier,

86
00:05:26,461 --> 00:05:29,090
I think at discounts in the amount
of work that's gone into building,

87
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:33,570
building those communities. Are
People working up towards, you know,

88
00:05:33,571 --> 00:05:36,420
becoming professionals or
white collar professionals?

89
00:05:36,421 --> 00:05:39,240
Like I don't think they
have Asians have it easier.

90
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,900
I think many Asians have
just fought harder. I don't,

91
00:05:42,901 --> 00:05:44,670
I'm not saying the
other communities don't.

92
00:05:44,671 --> 00:05:47,580
I just think that I think
they have earned it.

93
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:52,790
I think that part of like
how white supremacy works
to kind of like cover up is

94
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:53,671
they say like,

95
00:05:53,671 --> 00:05:58,671
well if this one group of minorities is
doing well then there can't be racism in

96
00:05:59,661 --> 00:06:00,494
this country.

97
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:05,530
We as Asian Americans have to understand
that we are props for white supremacy.

98
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:11,750
When we buy into the idea that all of
this stuff that we've gotten is purely

99
00:06:11,751 --> 00:06:14,330
through our hardware.
I do think Asians who have an easier,

100
00:06:14,331 --> 00:06:17,960
just because we're not
portrayed so negatively. Yeah,

101
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:21,980
we don't have as many like
overtly negative stereotypes
that are like thrown at

102
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:22,710
us.
You know?

103
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:26,730
I mean like you look at immigration and
like nobody's freaking out about Asians

104
00:06:26,731 --> 00:06:27,780
coming into the country,

105
00:06:27,781 --> 00:06:31,180
which I feel like it's just been
interesting to me to see you,

106
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:36,190
especially also like Asian Americans that
are okay with it because it's not them

107
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,790
right now. And that sense I'm like, oh,

108
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:43,791
we must have it easier because we're
not concerned about what's happening to

109
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,820
other people.

110
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,460
Three, two, one

111
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,700
super conflicted on this one.

112
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,940
I went to the motherland,
um,

113
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,570
maybe like five years ago and I thought
that it was just going to be like so

114
00:07:10,571 --> 00:07:14,500
much fun and they were going to like be
accepting and for the most part they are.

115
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:18,640
But when I went there I
realized like I'm not from here.

116
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:21,550
Like it was really pretty obvious.

117
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:25,620
I mean I definitely want to connect
to the culture that I was born into,

118
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:30,810
but also a huge part of my identity
is my queerness. And in Malaysia,

119
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:35,040
Lgbtq people definitely don't have the
same legal protections if they have any

120
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:35,970
protections at all.

121
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:40,590
And so that is painful to know that
if I went back I wouldn't be accepted.

122
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:43,070
It's a funny thing that happens
when I go back to China.

123
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:45,650
Just like the feeling
that I never get here,

124
00:07:45,651 --> 00:07:50,450
which is like when you walk onto a
public street you feel like you're not

125
00:07:50,451 --> 00:07:54,500
identified by what you look like,
which is amazing. But that being said,

126
00:07:54,501 --> 00:07:57,260
like I feel culturally I'm American,

127
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:01,280
I love being here and I think that being
like an individual with freedom is like

128
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:05,090
part of who I am in the sense that I
wouldn't necessarily fit in in China.

129
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,910
And I feel like so much of the time
we're like asked to be like, well,

130
00:08:07,911 --> 00:08:11,360
are you Asian? Are you American? It's
like, no, like I'm Asian American.

131
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:14,360
I don't think we have to be that for this.

132
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,583
Is it

133
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,970
three, two, one?

134
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:32,390
Yeah,
it's important to me.

135
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:37,530
No, it's okay. We just want
to know what you think. Yeah,

136
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:42,790
I mean like I think I think about
this a lot is like sometimes I

137
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:45,400
get thin,

138
00:08:45,401 --> 00:08:50,401
I'm Asian and then like it's kind of
jarring to being reminded than I am.

139
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,110
And so like

140
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:56,160
were you raised like with strong cultural

141
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,500
values and stuff?
I was raised,

142
00:08:58,501 --> 00:09:01,650
I'm a military brat and so
even though I grew up in Korea,

143
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,740
it was on the military base
and so it was like an American,

144
00:09:04,741 --> 00:09:08,730
a high school in like a small American
city in the middle looks song.

145
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:11,580
Me and my brother were
usually the only Asian kids.

146
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:16,260
So I remember kind of like do I want to
stand out as like the only Asian kid or

147
00:09:16,261 --> 00:09:18,330
do I just want to be
another one of the kids?

148
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:21,080
I think there can be balanced in that
and that was the biggest problem I had

149
00:09:21,081 --> 00:09:24,510
growing up is that I didn't know I
wanted to be American so bad. I just,

150
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:28,610
I thought I had to choose a side and
then eventually I was like, look,

151
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,920
both are part of going him.
But what his

152
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:32,420
further this

153
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:35,900
strongly agree part is I have a
three year old child is half Chinese,

154
00:09:35,901 --> 00:09:40,430
half Vietnamese and I don't want him to
live with the confusion that I grew up

155
00:09:40,431 --> 00:09:41,180
with.

156
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,460
For me like it actually,

157
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:47,720
I feel a lot of pain still and a lot of
grief because when we moved to the u s

158
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:52,550
and you know this was like in a time
still where you need to speak to your kids

159
00:09:52,551 --> 00:09:56,660
in English, they have to just know English
and anything else will confuse them.

160
00:09:56,690 --> 00:10:01,690
So my mom stopped speaking to me and Haka
and I forgot that language and we also

161
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:06,140
didn't really celebrate any
cultural traditions, you know,

162
00:10:06,141 --> 00:10:10,130
Chinese or Malaysian or Chinese Malaysian.
I have no idea what that really is.

163
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:13,790
And so, um, my culture is important to me,

164
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:17,580
but I'm still like trying to find my
way back to it. Like do you grow up?

165
00:10:17,581 --> 00:10:19,440
You're like socialized to fit in,
right.

166
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:22,880
And often means casting aside like
the culture that you grew up in check,

167
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:24,540
we're all experienced it to
some degree of like, hey,

168
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,940
should I like look into
like where I came from more?

169
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,640
It's a great thing if you can
be proud of where you came from.

170
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:32,040
I'm glad that we're connecting to that.

171
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,470
That was so fun. That was
interesting. Very, very,

172
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,570
can I be friends with all of the ones?

173
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:52,090
