1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,300
[inaudible]

2
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:09,980
in 1997 a psychologists conducted an
experiment that could lead any two people

3
00:00:09,981 --> 00:00:12,380
to fall in love using just 36 questions.

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:16,850
We took those 36 questions and ask
them to three complete strangers

5
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:21,200
just to see what happens.

6
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:40,183
Tell refreshing.

7
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:54,910
All right.
When did you last sing to yourself?

8
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:01,300
I sing all the time, so I
see you too. My girlfriend,

9
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,060
my homie in Georgia,

10
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:12,190
the first school hang
man, she just go nuts.

11
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:15,790
Romantic. I wish I had that
talent. The thing to my girlfriend,

12
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,570
she called me on the phone. They love
it. Whatever you do, they love it.

13
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:20,463
That's great.

14
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:22,380
All right.

15
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:30,360
What is the greatest
accomplishment of your life?

16
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:36,800
I would say the greatest accomplishment
of my life is being able to reach my

17
00:01:36,801 --> 00:01:41,440
dream of being a pro wrestler
around eight years old. Um,

18
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:45,680
you know, I discovered
professional wrestling and I
was glued to the television.

19
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:49,490
Um, my father was abusive, you
know, I didn't have a father figure,

20
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:54,230
so the people that I watched on TV were
like my heroes and right then I knew

21
00:01:54,231 --> 00:01:57,110
that one day I wanted to be a
professional wrestler. That was my dream.

22
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:02,420
I developed a fan base of a
lot of children that don't
have like a father figure.

23
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:06,710
Being able to do that for kids.
Um, it's really important to me.

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,833
Okay.

25
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:13,230
Two doors and we see it without them.

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,820
There would be no change in me.

27
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:23,130
I was just wild and crazy
when I was young. Um,

28
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:26,640
and so I was a bad kid,
honestly afraid of nothing.

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,110
Talk to security. I'm like eight,
nine, just like what is wrong with you?

30
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,720
And so that's a lack of love.

31
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:38,310
And so not having a father and a
mom to really love you. But yeah,

32
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:41,620
just my daughters,
when they came to soften me,

33
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,600
I was combing their hair
and picking out clothes,

34
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,170
wearing dresses and for
them to make them smile.

35
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:52,230
And that was the greatest accomplishment
of all the things that I've done.

36
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,540
I respect you for that man.
Yes,

37
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:58,620
I would say for myself is
the greatest accomplishment.

38
00:02:58,621 --> 00:03:00,510
It would definitely be as a trainer,

39
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,340
like being with actually change
someone's life in a positive way.

40
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:07,050
Growing up I was like
very skinny kid and um,

41
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:12,040
I was bullied a lot.
And so I was pretty,

42
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:16,150
I was an angry person and so I just
started training my room and it became

43
00:03:16,151 --> 00:03:19,930
something that I realized was much
more positive than breaking things.

44
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:22,750
It's amazing, man. Thank
you. That's amazing.

45
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:26,220
You guys are very genuine.
I'm really, I really do it

46
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:28,510
Myra you for that. Thank you very
much. You're welcome. Thank you.

47
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:33,550
What is your most terrible memory?

48
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:37,983
Oh,

49
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:42,680
I can go first.
I was playing tennis.

50
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:46,440
I hit a ball and it hit on the bullies.
Um,

51
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:50,240
I remember him jumping
behind me and strangling me.

52
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:55,160
There were people around me and, uh,
instead of like standing out for me,

53
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,580
everyone was just laughing,
uh,

54
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:01,730
ridiculing me while it was like being
strangled and choked on the ground.

55
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,310
It was just a time where I really was
just going through a lot of mental

56
00:04:07,311 --> 00:04:08,144
battles.

57
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:13,190
That was the time where I
would contemplate oftentimes
like suicidal thoughts at

58
00:04:13,191 --> 00:04:14,024
times.

59
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,430
And so I would say that is like probably
one of the more terrible memories from

60
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,293
alive.
Yeah.

61
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,873
Yeah.

62
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,470
Um, one of my most terrible
memories is when I was 16,

63
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:29,490
I was shoplifting because all the kids
at school are wearing like all the fancy

64
00:04:29,491 --> 00:04:32,850
clothes, like Nautica and Tommy
Hilfiger. And I wanted to be cool,

65
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,520
but we didn't have money so I would
steal clothes and I got caught.

66
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,410
I was only 16 years old.

67
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:40,890
I didn't know what to expect and
I was like crying and everything.

68
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:44,490
The security guard called my grandparents
and they were really disappointed in

69
00:04:44,491 --> 00:04:48,060
me. And then they put me in
juvenile hall for a month.

70
00:04:48,061 --> 00:04:49,860
That was the scariest
experience of my life.

71
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,250
I realized that I need to change my life.
So I stopped stealing,

72
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,180
never stole again.

73
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:59,010
So I think we have our terrible memories
for a reason to teach us and it allows

74
00:04:59,011 --> 00:05:02,250
us to grow stronger. They're just
hurdles that we have to jump over.

75
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,720
Mine is been sick for like 12 years and
I was just depressed seeing everyone

76
00:05:10,861 --> 00:05:12,090
smile and happy.

77
00:05:12,091 --> 00:05:16,490
And here I am taking four or five
naps a day trying to survive,

78
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:20,850
losing jobs. And, uh, you never
say, why do you need, and you'd say,

79
00:05:20,851 --> 00:05:22,710
why do you need what
you're actually saying?

80
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:27,240
Why not her or him give that to her?
And that's not fair.

81
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:28,410
So why not you?

82
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:34,310
What roles do love and affection,
play?

83
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,570
Love.
That word could change someone's life.

84
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:42,640
I just learned to say I love you.

85
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:48,570
And that was recently I told my nephew
that I love and he cried because his

86
00:05:49,841 --> 00:05:54,780
father,
they did some studies who they spoke to,

87
00:05:54,781 --> 00:05:55,614
snow floods

88
00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:00,290
and one that is current
stack the snowflake.

89
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:03,980
It's just terrible looking and wanted.
They spoke love to.

90
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,860
It's just so beautiful
and it never changed.

91
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:10,730
So that's what happens when you speak
life into people and will you help them

92
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:14,940
raise your vibrations in your energy?
I love that sense.

93
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,120
Totally agree with that.
Life is all about love.

94
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:22,110
It's okay for a man to have
affection and show affection.

95
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:26,130
It doesn't make him weak at all.
It's not unmanly for Amanda cry.

96
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:28,350
I've always been an emotional person.

97
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:31,440
So like if a wrestler has to retire
or someone that I really looked up to

98
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:35,910
watching the TV, watching them make
their speech, I've shed tears, you know,

99
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:39,480
to that like, so things
like that, you know,

100
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:43,880
we were given those tiers for a reason.
How do you feel about it,

101
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:48,620
your relationship with your mother?
Obviously like I said,

102
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:52,540
I didn't have one, but people
say I talk like her. Um,

103
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,430
she was a humanitarian basis.

104
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,040
She spoke wise and she was
involved with the community.

105
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:01,620
That's all she cared about.
So I just try to harm her.

106
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:07,810
My story with my mother is
very touching. It's sad. Um,

107
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:10,530
I'm proud of her in some ways,

108
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,850
but I'm also disappointed in other ways.
You know,

109
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,260
she was a single mom and she was
using drugs as we were growing up.

110
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:22,950
She wasn't there very much, but
I know she loved us, but it just,

111
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:26,880
she had outside influences from
the men that she was bringing in.

112
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:30,670
We were evicted out of our house
when I was 19 years old. Um,

113
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:33,780
I ended up taking care of my 12 year
old brother and then my mom ended up

114
00:07:33,781 --> 00:07:34,530
homeless.

115
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:39,530
My mom was homeless for 10
years and unfortunately it's
hard to help people that

116
00:07:39,961 --> 00:07:42,030
really don't want the help.
You know,

117
00:07:42,031 --> 00:07:45,510
she went to a Rehab facility and
she got off drugs for a little bit,

118
00:07:45,511 --> 00:07:47,760
but then she relapsed and got
back along and it was very,

119
00:07:47,761 --> 00:07:52,650
very frustrating and there was a period
of time we're writing communicate with

120
00:07:52,651 --> 00:07:56,760
her and right now she's trying to get
her life back in order. I love my mom.

121
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:02,030
I'm just praying and I'm hoping that
she can stay clean and I just wanted to

122
00:08:02,341 --> 00:08:03,240
know that I do love her

123
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:08,980
just because our F my own
family dynamic is something I,

124
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:13,260
I don't generally share with the public.
I know she loves me and you know,

125
00:08:13,261 --> 00:08:17,190
we love, I love her too, but it's
very challenging to communicate.

126
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:20,820
And um,
and that is what I will say for that

127
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:31,460
complete this sentence. I wish I
had someone with whom I could share

128
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:38,520
life. I would say I'm single right
now. So this is something that, um,

129
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:42,300
I don't know if I'm like really
searching for it right now yet. Uh,

130
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,970
but I think definitely in the future or
would like to be able to share life with

131
00:08:46,971 --> 00:08:48,500
someone.
Yeah,

132
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,410
you'll get it. I believe that sometimes
it comes to you when you least expect it.

133
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,830
And that's what I learned.
The universe handled that

134
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,390
like with mine came last year.
It wasn't exciting nervous,

135
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:05,400
it's just she just came along.
She was really,

136
00:09:05,401 --> 00:09:08,630
she was so, yeah, you can't look forward.

137
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,130
It's kind of the universe
will do the work.

138
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:14,550
It's like a mailman when you put
a letter in the mailbox, right.

139
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:18,570
You don't go keep, you don't go to that
mailbox everyday or to the and say, hey,

140
00:09:18,571 --> 00:09:21,900
did you met with my letter off?
It's the PostNet his job now.

141
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:27,120
So do it and leave it alone if
it's four years going to happen.

142
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,100
And that's how relationships
are too. Hmm. Yeah. So,

143
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:41,203
well,

144
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:48,600
I would say someone who I can grow with
substantially in many aspects of life.

145
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:52,020
I think the perfect woman that most
people would agree with would be someone

146
00:09:52,021 --> 00:09:52,854
that's supportive,

147
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:58,320
is motivating you can grow with and that
you can learn from someone with a great

148
00:09:58,321 --> 00:10:03,270
personality and a determination and a
drive and a woman that is also independent

149
00:10:03,271 --> 00:10:07,800
as well and that will support you and
what you want to do and that will always

150
00:10:07,801 --> 00:10:11,180
listen to you and that somebody
that you can confide in. Yeah,

151
00:10:11,181 --> 00:10:13,410
I believe that would
make up a perfect woman.

152
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:17,710
Okay.
There is no terrific women,

153
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,910
no man,

154
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:24,830
whatever comes to you and it
agrees with chest spirit. Yes.

155
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:29,030
Your twin flame, that's perfect because
everybody's not going to understand you.

156
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:33,860
You guys can be the panda helmets
when you're riding motorcycles.

157
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:38,060
That's perfection. There's personally
cause you guys invited. Yeah.

158
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,633
Man,

159
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,970
that's a great thing about you as you
can really put things into perspective.

160
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,250
Definitely.
Thank you.

161
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:50,320
Tell the other two what
you like about them.

162
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:54,280
Be Very honest this time saying things
that you might not say to someone you've

163
00:10:54,281 --> 00:10:55,114
just met.

164
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:02,840
What I admire about you
is how honest you are. Um,

165
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:07,030
you offer amazing perspective
on everything. Um,

166
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,930
you seem very spiritual and comfortable
with who you are as a person and who

167
00:11:10,931 --> 00:11:14,250
have you grown into. And then for
you, your life story is amazing.

168
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,570
What you've been through and how you
overcame the bullying and everything. Um,

169
00:11:17,571 --> 00:11:20,040
I really admire that about you.
Thank you very much. You're welcome.

170
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:21,820
Yeah,
I will say that about you too.

171
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:25,440
Cause hurt people usually hurt
people and we didn't take that route.

172
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:30,480
So that's commendable.
Your whole aura five is peaceful.

173
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,230
You can't keep a piece without chaos.

174
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:37,740
All of the chaos in your life has
given you peace. That's beautiful man.

175
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,860
I would say one thing I really
admired about you right now,

176
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:45,300
you're very insightful. Like what
you said earlier about why me. Right?

177
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:48,790
And that was kind of like,
wow. Yeah, I mean, yeah,

178
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,030
I really admire your vulnerability.

179
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,450
You being able to share those challenging
circumstances in life and it's an

180
00:11:55,451 --> 00:12:00,220
honor to be here, both of you, both
of you guys at kings, you know,

181
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,690
for lunch he'd been through and
like I said, you can lead a war.

182
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:06,720
You can lead an army. Maybe
you don't think so. The,

183
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,770
all the things that you been prepared
for your whole life prepared you for.

184
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,630
You can't become a shot in master
unless you go through the training.

185
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,720
I think they spiked it
actually. Oh, did they?

186
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,110
That's it.

187
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:37,690
And so by the end of the afternoon,
David Curtis and Damon,

188
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,630
three men who had never met before,

189
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:43,840
had drank about three liters
together and became pretty friendly

190
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:52,690
in the next episode. And unlikely trio
of young folk shed some tears over tea.

191
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:55,900
Also check out some of her other work.

192
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,410
You might enjoy it until next time.
