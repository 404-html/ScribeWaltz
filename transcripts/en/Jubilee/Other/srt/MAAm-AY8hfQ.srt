1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,830
He is a famous dance move.

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,820
Please come on.
I know if the world's ready for that.

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:06,450
Okay.

4
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,340
It's just real small movements
in the knees. Handed the head.

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:13,960
Go Darling.

6
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,540
I am Jake Scott.

7
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:30,440
I am 27 years old and I am a musician

8
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:32,470
and I'm Rachel Scott.

9
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:36,610
I am 30 years old and I am
an actress and a writer.

10
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:41,530
Friends for five years, dating
four years, married two years,

11
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:42,923
two and a half.

12
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:48,430
Can you hear me?
I can read your lips.

13
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:55,000
I had just moved to la like five days
before and I got invited to go play

14
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:55,863
ultimate Frisbee.

15
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:58,780
I was totally going there thinking
I'm not going to meet a girl.

16
00:00:58,781 --> 00:01:02,590
I just moved to this new city like
I have no plans for meeting girls.

17
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,430
And then I met Rachel and I was like,
oh crap,

18
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,100
this girl is something else.

19
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:12,940
It was made known to me by
all of her friends like, hey,

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,660
she's totally still into her ex boyfriend,
so just don't get your heartbroken.

21
00:01:16,661 --> 00:01:19,000
And I was like, yeah, cool.
Thanks for the advice,

22
00:01:19,001 --> 00:01:22,240
but I'm gonna I'm going to proceed
forward here because if I didn't try,

23
00:01:22,241 --> 00:01:24,310
I knew that I would never
forgive myself for that.

24
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,960
It must have been a Saturday because
we were playing ultimate frisbee.

25
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:34,800
I had gone through a breakup in January.
We met in July. He stood out to me,

26
00:01:34,801 --> 00:01:39,600
but I was like, I was not
on the market, so I was just
like, oh, this is a nice guy.

27
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,040
We started hanging out a lot. I
was like, I know who I'm marrying.

28
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:47,280
It's this other guy over here and also
I can't stop hanging out with Jake and

29
00:01:47,281 --> 00:01:49,170
all my friends are like, okay, we get it.

30
00:01:49,171 --> 00:01:51,810
You can stop telling us you don't like
Jake. Why do you keep bringing up Jake?

31
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:54,060
And I was like, yeah, I don't like
Jake. Okay. I don't like Jake.

32
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:59,010
But he was unlike anyone I had met and
our connection was unlike anything I had

33
00:01:59,011 --> 00:02:01,170
met.
But that was confusing at first for me.

34
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,340
I said, we met at Frisbee. Me Too.

35
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,780
I said there was a lingering ex boyfriend
who is still occupying her affection

36
00:02:10,781 --> 00:02:11,490
at the time.

37
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:15,090
Same. I mean how can we forget
that this was a drama for

38
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:22,000
so long story short,
I finally am done with ex boyfriend.

39
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:25,530
Tell him and then about
a month later I see Jake.

40
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:28,890
It was like a curtain had been
pulled back so he picks me up.

41
00:02:28,891 --> 00:02:30,570
We go to Joan's on third,

42
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:34,370
we went to Joan's on third in studio
city cause we both love that place.

43
00:02:34,371 --> 00:02:35,200
It's like our favorite

44
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,900
and I know that sounds crazy but I
remember sitting there thinking if I don't

45
00:02:37,901 --> 00:02:41,410
marry this guy, I just really felt
at peace with him in that moment.

46
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:45,400
And then we wanted to hike. We were
there for a long time just talking.

47
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:49,750
I guess after that we would, back
to his apartment, we got Thai food.

48
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:53,860
I had bought this like behemoth
bottle of cheap red wine.

49
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,050
I was like trying to be smooth
and coolest stuff like that.

50
00:02:56,051 --> 00:03:00,130
Then the bag just rips out from the
bottom of the bottle smashes. He cleans

51
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:02,510
it up, he gets us another
bottle of wine and I was,

52
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:06,460
I mean it was just like really showed
his heart the way he handled that very

53
00:03:06,461 --> 00:03:07,294
small moment.

54
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:12,130
We went on a walk and we ended up with
this like hill where we overlooked la.

55
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:19,820
Okay, you're talking about Narnia.
Yeah. You did forgot about Narnia. Oh,

56
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:23,060
this is the best part of the date.
I actually couldn't hear anything.

57
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:27,000
It was in my hands doing
this. You did this and I was
like, oh my gosh. Narnia. No,

58
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:31,080
her name is where I knew
I loved Rachel will.

59
00:03:31,081 --> 00:03:32,610
You knew before I knew that,

60
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,180
but that was like confirmation to me
cause it was like this is the most perfect

61
00:03:36,181 --> 00:03:37,350
moment of my life.

62
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,510
I said at first I had made this weird,

63
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:48,810
silly commitment to myself that I was
only going to say I love you to a person.

64
00:03:50,261 --> 00:03:52,360
When I knew I could follow up on it,

65
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,720
I want to mean it when I say it and
I want to only say it to one person.

66
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:59,800
Hopefully we went on a trip
with my family to Paris.

67
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:04,150
It was the last night at the trip, I had
written Rachel this really long letter.

68
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,170
And um,

69
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:10,360
I told her that I loved her for the
first time and I actually proposed at the

70
00:04:10,361 --> 00:04:15,010
end of the letter. So I said, I love
you for the first time when I proposed

71
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:21,100
no, I think I might cry. Um, so he said,

72
00:04:21,101 --> 00:04:26,101
I love you first and the reason it's
making me cries because I just had such a

73
00:04:27,131 --> 00:04:30,460
history of like throwing my heart around.
And I had said,

74
00:04:30,461 --> 00:04:31,660
I love you a million times.

75
00:04:31,661 --> 00:04:36,040
And so to think that this whole time
there was some guy holding out to only say

76
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:38,240
it to one person and that I'm
that one person that's really,

77
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:42,920
um, amazing. I want it to mean it.

78
00:04:42,921 --> 00:04:47,360
And I wanted to know that I could say
that and know that I had waited to say

79
00:04:47,361 --> 00:04:49,880
that to one person than I knew I could be.

80
00:04:49,881 --> 00:04:51,650
You would be the only
person I never say it to.

81
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:55,530
And you are the only person I've
ever said it to. No, I'm crying.

82
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,720
I always want to come across as perfect.

83
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:09,990
And so ultimately what that means is
sometimes I would hide things from her and

84
00:05:09,991 --> 00:05:11,160
I wouldn't be honest,

85
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:16,340
I'd lie like making decisions on how to
manage money and there were times when I

86
00:05:17,491 --> 00:05:22,200
would make some mistakes over here,
but then I would just be like, oh,

87
00:05:22,201 --> 00:05:23,280
I'm going to take care of this.

88
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:26,070
I don't need to share this because
I'll take care of it, I'll handle it,

89
00:05:26,071 --> 00:05:26,904
I'll handle it.

90
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:31,260
And I would hide things from her until
ultimately I couldn't hide him anymore.

91
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:35,110
Seeing Rachel's face when

92
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:39,570
she found out that I was
lying to her about anything,

93
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:43,200
it's just like the most heartbreaking
thing I've had to go through.

94
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,013
Hell man.

95
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:52,310
Being in a relationship where I'm
truly vulnerable for the first time,

96
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:55,390
I think with that comes out
the best and the worst of you.

97
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:58,430
And when I'm sad or feel
I cover it with anger,

98
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:03,610
I can get so mad and then I'll be
mad at him and I'll be aware of like,

99
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,890
oh, this is whatever I'm angry
at isn't really his fault.

100
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:10,670
But it's hard to let go of anger in those
moments because what I'll do is I'll

101
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:13,490
go out in the world and give my best to
everyone else and then come home and be

102
00:06:13,491 --> 00:06:17,420
exhausted and if something's gone wrong
in my day, I'll take it out on him.

103
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,200
If that happens enough,
you know,

104
00:06:19,201 --> 00:06:24,201
it's affects him and so it really makes
you start dealing with your stuff that

105
00:06:24,621 --> 00:06:28,670
you've kind of put away in corners and
not dealt with or made excuses for.

106
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:32,930
The consequences of my actions
now don't just affect me.

107
00:06:32,931 --> 00:06:37,710
They affect you too. And it's made
me grow up in a lot of ways. Yeah.

108
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,820
If you would look on paper at the
things that we've gone through,

109
00:06:40,821 --> 00:06:44,120
like we haven't had like any
traumatic event happened to us,

110
00:06:44,121 --> 00:06:48,590
but like being so connected,
like your souls are connected,

111
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:51,700
you don't just wake up knowing how
to do that the right way. You know,

112
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:52,231
Andy,

113
00:06:52,231 --> 00:06:56,800
you come into marriage typically thinking
you're doing well and then it exposes

114
00:06:56,801 --> 00:06:59,080
all these things in the relationship.

115
00:06:59,081 --> 00:07:03,880
And so I think to have a
healthy relationship you have
to be healthy individuals

116
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,510
through getting healthy on our own.
The marriage and turn becomes healthier.

117
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:09,663
Yeah.

118
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:17,020
I love how Rachel feels so
passionately about everything.

119
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:25,780
She sees the beauty in humanity and in
the world and it is such a joy to have

120
00:07:28,971 --> 00:07:33,110
her in my life because it makes me see
the beauty and everything like in just

121
00:07:33,111 --> 00:07:36,350
little things that I would just walk past
and never think about. Like she just,

122
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:40,400
she feels, it's so deeply, she's
like the color and my world.

123
00:07:40,401 --> 00:07:45,401
Like you are so much better
than I could've ever dreamed
and you honestly make

124
00:07:46,671 --> 00:07:48,050
me such a better man.

125
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:49,710
Yeah.

126
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:51,840
I am super up and down.

127
00:07:51,841 --> 00:07:56,841
I feel a lot and he is so steady
and he's also really taught me about

128
00:07:57,901 --> 00:08:00,300
vulnerability and intimacy because again,

129
00:08:00,301 --> 00:08:04,920
I had so many past relationships where
I was never truly intimate or truly

130
00:08:04,921 --> 00:08:09,921
vulnerable is just given me a safe
place to be myself and to actually be

131
00:08:09,931 --> 00:08:11,940
intimate and vulnerable with someone.

132
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:17,790
You really are everything to me.
So I was going to say,

133
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:22,380
you are my world and I'm truly
would be in shambles without you.

134
00:08:22,381 --> 00:08:25,230
I have no idea.
I'd probably be dead in a ditch somewhere.

135
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,660
Farmer in Ohio,
Ohio is great,

136
00:08:29,661 --> 00:08:33,170
but you know, it's hard for me
to talk about the way I feel,

137
00:08:33,171 --> 00:08:38,171
but I really do love you and you
are truly the only person for me,

138
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:41,210
like really?
If you left or died,

139
00:08:41,211 --> 00:08:46,211
I would just be happily single because
you are the only person I want to be

140
00:08:46,881 --> 00:08:49,900
with.
I really am so thankful for you.

141
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:53,283
Let me do

142
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,660
it's breakfast

143
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,230
together while she's sleeping
in your high school sweater.

144
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:04,210
Never seen anything better.

145
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:09,840
It's the season three.
You watch

146
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:15,570
evening or
