Speaker 1:          00:01          Whoa.

Speaker 2:          00:18          Hello everyone. Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and my name is Paul. Today's topic is the Hungarian language or my job and he has, as it's called in Hungarian. Hungarian is not just another European language. There's nothing else quite like it for starters, it's not an Indo European language. So when you look at a map and see that Europe's Hungarian speaking areas are surrounded by Indo European languages, you have to ask yourself, how did Hungarian get there? Most Hungarian speakers live in the carpathian basin, bordered by the Carpathian mountains to the north, east and south. That includes not only around 10 million speakers in Hungary, but also in areas of the basin in neighboring countries, including Romania, Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia, Austria, Slovakia, and Ukraine. The largest Hungarian speaking minority is in northwestern and central Romania were around 1.2 million people speak at or around 6% of the country's population.

Speaker 2:          01:20          All of these Hungarian areas in the car pay the invasives. We're part of the Kingdom of Hungary until 1920 when many areas were seated to other countries. But how did they get there in the first place? Hungarian is a member of the eugric branch of the urologic language family, which originated in the vicinity of the Ural Mountains, which separate Europe from western Siberia. The urologic languages include two main groupings, semiotic, which was the first group to branch off from your Alec and Pheno eugric around 2000 bce or maybe earlier Finnell eugric split into protal Eugric, the ancestor of the eugric branch, and Prodo Finnick, the ancestor of the Finnick languages, including finish and Astonian. Prodo eugric remained a unified language for more than a millennium until Hungarian diverged from it around 800 bce. There's some debate about whether the Hungarian ethnic group, the man jars, originated to the west or to the east of the euro mountains.

Speaker 2:          02:17          But at some point around 2000 years ago, they became nomadic in response to changes in climate and landscape, and began gradually migrating towards the West, eventually reaching the Carpathian basin in the ninth century, both while settled near the Ural Mountains and while migrating west, the madge, ours had extensive contact with Turkic peoples. For instance, the my jars formed part of a tribal alliance with Turkic tribes called on. No good meaning 10 tribes, which was based in the northern Black Sea area. This, by the way, is the most likely origin of the term Hungarian and it's equivalent Udon Gotti and Latin uhmm [inaudible] in Greek and own Goodie in Podo Slavic after the owner Guler alliance disintegrated, they became part of the cozaar connate, a Turkic Empire covering much of the Caucasus region and the Black Sea area for a time. They collected taxes from Slavic people on behalf of the Kossar's until they became politically independent from the Kossar's in the year eight 30 this interaction with Turkic tribes and political entities led to significant Turkic influence on the Hungarian language.

Speaker 2:          03:22          It's hard to give an exact count of the number of Turkic loan words in Hungarian, but this lexicon contains around 500 loan words from old Turkic. Also, the old Hungarian script developed from the [inaudible] script, the Turkic runic script that was used by the Kossar's in the ninth century. The majora's. We're carrying out frequent raids in Europe and in the year 896 they crossed the Carpathian mountains under the leadership of outer pod and began settling in the Carpathian basin by the year 1000, uh, Christian kingdom was established under King Stephen. The first under him Hungarian began to be written in the Latin Alphabet, but for some time the old Hungarian script was used as well for vernacular writing. It was used by the [inaudible] until at least the 17th century and since the early 20th century, it has undergone a revival to some extent with limited use for symbolic and cultural reasons.

Speaker 2:          04:19          Stephen the first also med Latin, the sole official language of Hungary. And it remains so until the 19th century, the old Hungarian period, the old Hungarian period conventionally begins with the settlement of the car pay the invasive. This is around the time of the earliest fragments of written Hungarian, which date back to the 10th century and a written than the old Hungarian script. Isolated words written in the Latin alphabet can be found dating back to the mid 11th century. And the oldest extensive texts is from 1192 the late 12th century. Hungarian has changed relatively little since the old Hungarian period, but due to contact with other languages and the assimilation of other tribes, it has absorbed words from a variety of languages, including German and the erotic and Slavic languages as well as Latin and the Turkic languages we've already discussed. Middle Hungarian, the Middle Hungarian period began with the printing of the first books in Hungarian.

Speaker 2:          05:19          During much of this period, the Ottoman occupation of central and southern Hungary took place and the Habsburg empire ruled the northern and northwestern areas, which likely brought some additional Turkic, specifically Turkish and dramatic influences to the language modern Hungarian. In the 18th and 19th centuries, Hungarian underwent a language reform in order to standardize it, to make it more suitable for literature and to make it more suitable for the sciences. They revived old vocabulary, used existing routes and fx station to create new words and introduced some dialectal words on a national level in order to expand the vocabulary. In 1836 it became the official language alongside Latin, and in 1844 it became the sole official language of Hungary. From 1867 to 1918 the kingdom of Hungary was part of the Union of Austria, Hungary. In 1920 after Austria, Hungary is involvement in the first world war.

Speaker 2:          06:15          The treaty of Triano redrew the borders of Hungary and assigned many of its areas to neighboring countries based on the ethnic composition of their populations. This resulted in the current situation in which millions of Hungarian speakers live outside of Hungary in neighboring countries, despite the fact that Hungarian has ancient connections to other urologic languages today, it's similarities to them are not immediately obvious, and despite the fact that Hungarian vocabulary has been widely influenced by other languages, the borrowed words are mostly older words that are further obscured through compounding and affixation. For example, the word Goomba, meaning mushroom. This was borrowed from old slavonic Goomba. In modern Bulgarian, it's Guba and in Super Mario brothers, it's Goomba.

Speaker 2:          07:05          But this word can also form a compound word with this word here, Sienna meaning species. Goma Fayetta means fungus to make it plural. We add a k Goma ferric. Then there might be a case ending gum buffet cat. Now what's in the accusative case? You may be thinking, Hey, that beginning part is still recognizable to speakers of Bulgarian. Yeah, maybe. But in other Slavic languages, that route is not so commonly used anymore or has changed more than it has in Bulgarian. Like in Slovak. It's who the main point I'm getting at is that a lot of the loan words in Hungarian or not immediately recognizable, but anyway, that brings us to the most important question. What's Hungarian? Like? Hungarian is an a gluten native language, meaning that words are made up of a linear sequence of morphemes that each contribute a piece of meaning to the word.

Speaker 2:          07:54          So let's start with this word. Vital meaning city. For the plural, we add oh vital, she'll meaning cities and for words ending in a vowel, you just add. For the first person, singular possessive. We add boom of auto show, meaning my city. Now let's make it a location of [inaudible] means in my city. This here, by the way, it was the definite article, which we'll look at a little later. So you can see how we start with the root word and add suffixes to it to add meaning, but the suffixes are not always exactly the same. For example, Jeb meaning pocket for this word, the plural would be Jeff Beck. My pocket [inaudible] my pockets in the plural [inaudible] in my pocket. [inaudible] them in my pockets or champagne, Ben. So what's up with all the ease instead of the oes and the a is we saw in the first word, well, Hungarian features something called vowel harmony.

Speaker 2:          08:52          This means that the vowels which appear and suffixes depend on the vowel in the final syllable of the word. So the suffix is in the first example. Vitals are in harmony with the vowel. Oh, and the suffix is in the second example, Jeb are in harmony with the vowel e. The exact value used also depends on the type of suffix. We can also see vowel harmony and a gluten nation in Hungarians verb conjugations. The base form of the verb meaning to write is ead for regular verbs. These verb endings here are added to verbs with one of the following vowels in the final syllable. The base form of the verb, meaning to drive or to lead is visit. These verb endings here are added to verbs with one of the following vowels in the final syllable, either shorts he or long Ie. The base form of the verb meaning to sit is these endings right here are added to verbs with any of these vowels in the last syllable, but there's more. These conjugations you see here are indefinite conjugations.

Speaker 2:          09:55          Transitive verbs in Hungarian have different conjugations depending on whether the object is definite or indefinite. Let's take the verb to write in. Edo means I write or just eeoc because Hungarian is pro drop, meaning the subject pronouns can be dropped. Edo Call Amit, I write something beat Oak Ridge. Can you vet I write the book here we have a direct object and edge is an indefinite article Util mcha and Yvette. I write the book is a definite article and you dome is the definite conjugation. Hungarian verbs also have past tense forms, both definite and indefinite ones with almost no exceptions. There is no separate form for future tense, but the future can be expressed using the infinitive of a verb plus the present tense of the verb folk knee. So I will write a book is evening, so we'll catch you Yvette and I will write, the book is [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          10:56          There are also numerous prefixes which can be added to verbs, some of which add a new shade of meaning to the verb and others which completely changed the meaning of the verb before we saw the verb, which means to sit as in you are currently in a seated position. If you want to express the meaning of sit as in sit down, you add the prefix net load and it can also mean to serve like in this phrase, meaning to serve a prison sentence. [inaudible] to say sit up. In other words, to stop slouching. You say fed who bevel means sit in sometimes used for getting into a car and Lou means to sit still or to sit away from the prefix. [inaudible] means away. This word also means blow over or subside. And before we saw the verb visit, meaning drive or lead, and it also means to conduct electricity live as that means drive down like from a hill or from the capitol to the countryside.

Speaker 2:          11:57          But it also means deduce bev as it means to drive into. And it also means introduce, in other words to put into practice fan of as that means mislead or deceive. And there are numerous more the way that these prefixes, ultra or the meanings of words is not always consistent. So you can't always just put two and two together, but sometimes that works. There are also a couple of types of suffixes that can be attached to the verb to change its meaning, but at depending on vowel harmony or that that show causation. For example, visit means drive or lead visit. That means make someone drive and after that you can add verb endings to conjugate it, like visit the drink. We make someone drive and that's the indefinite form. By the way, visit that Duke is the definite form visit that you Daniella as, oh this means we make Daniel drive the car.

Speaker 2:          12:55          Leather is the instrumental case suffix, which is used here to show who is being caused to do something. It's basic forms are evolve and vel depending on vowel harmony. But when attached to announce ending in a consonant, The v assimilates to the final consonant resulting in germination, uh, doubled. Consonant Oz is the definite article before we saw the form awe, but when the noun begins with a vowel, then the form Oz is used. The term at the end of our tote is the accusative case ending, which is used to indicate the direct object cases. One of the most notorious aspects of the Hungarian language is it system of cases which are attached to nouns. There are 18 cases though. Some people will say there are more. Look at these tables for the noun meaning car. This looks pretty intimidating. However, most of these case endings function in a similar way to prepositions in English, except that they are after the word.

Speaker 2:          13:53          In other words, they're like post positions. Take the date of case form. Oh, don't fuck. This means to the car. The instrumental case, oh, dovall would mean by car the terminated case. Oh de League would mean something like as far as the car. For example, if you were going to walk until you reached the car, the ines IV case, oh bum would mean in the car, the ablative case, outdoor coil would mean away from the car and so on. So thinking of them as post positions rather than case endings might make it a little less intimidating. And it may look like there are separate forms for plural nouns, but the really aren't. The plural forms simply have the plural suffix [inaudible] and then the case endings are added after that. The only tweak to that is the double consonant in the instrumental case that we saw before, as well as in another case called the translative case. Unlike in many other languages, cases only affect nouns, not adjectives or articles. In addition to cases, there are also possessive suffixes and these can be used together with various case endings. Oh Dome my car. And to express this fully, we need to use the definite article [inaudible] I am in my car as oh towed your car and she shit cause I'm walking away from your car. Or maybe it would be as [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          15:20          I'm walking away from your car with the emphasis on your car. Hungarian word order is not set in stone. When something appears before the verb, it is emphasized, so by moving the Noun to the beginning, we are placing emphasis on it. The verb prefix or pre verb l meaning away also moves out of the way when something else is placed in front of the verb to emphasize it, it's like the main verb is handing the emphasis over to whatever comes before it, but if there's a pre verb in the way, the main verb can't pass the emphasis, but if the pre verb gets out of the way, then there's nothing blocking the emphasis from being handed over. Since these pre verbs can be split from the main verb, they can be referred to as co verbs. Let's add an adverb to this sentence as shit [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          16:07          This means I'm walking slowly away from your car with no particular emphasis now loves sean shade. That'll cause a toto. This means I'm walking slowly away from your car with the emphasis on slowly when there's an explicit subject placing it before the verb places emphasis on it. If there's no pre bourbon, the way Michael [inaudible], Michael is walking slowly away from your car. This sentence has no particular emphasis, but let's get the pre verb out of the way. My good shape that allison has, oh, toto Michael is walking slowly away from your car here. The emphasis is on Michael because it comes right before the verb. My coolest [inaudible] Michael is walking slowly away from your car. Again, the emphasis here is on La Shaunn slowly because it comes right before the verb. This position right before the verb is the most emphatic if the verb comes at the beginning before an explicit subject than the verbus emphasized, but for this sentence, the meaning wouldn't really make sense.

Speaker 2:          17:14          A couple of notes on Hungarian phonology and orthography in terms of phonology and orthography Hungarians, not exactly the simplest language out there. There are 14 vowels. This includes seven pairs of short and long equivalent with the acute accents indicating long vowels. One of the immediately noticeable features is the double acute accent to show the long equivalents of the vowels with uhmm louts. There are also 30 consonants for a total of 44 letters in the Hungarian alphabet, but some of the consonants consist of two or three orthographic letters. These consonants with Y, our palatalized consonants, and there are these others. See s equals chuck, D, Z, s equals j, e, s, z equals C and Z, s equals g. In addition to palatalized consonants, another common phonological and orthographic feature is germination lengthened consonants that are represented by double consonants in writing. If you see a sentence that contains double consonants, consonants followed by Y and multiple acute accents, Uhmm, louts or a double a cute accent, then you're almost certainly looking at Hungarian.

Speaker 2:          18:24          Let's look at one final sentence in Hungarian and break it down. Now, everybodyokay Hash, mathematic ab, that damage cabbies album. The sentence means I'm not hungry because I already ate lunch at a cafe word for word. It's no, I am hungry because already I have lunch, a cafe in first we see the negation word Nem. This word doesn't change and you just put it before the part of the sentence that you want to make negative. There are other forms of negotiation as well, but this is the basic way in indicative sentences. Next we see video which means I am this ending. Oh is a typical present tense ending meaning I with its vowel harmonizing with this a vowel awe. But this verb is a rather special one in irregular verb. Removing oak would give you the third person singular present tense form. But for this verb, [inaudible] is the second person singular and the third person singular is Vaughn. It also has a different past tense stem voight and it's also the only Hungarian verb with its own inflected. Future tense form. Other verbs express the future using two verbs like we saw before.

Speaker 2:          19:35          A Hash is the word for hungry. The singular form of this word is always the same and has never inflected for gender or case and be that, um, is the first person singular past tense of the verb, meaning to have lunch and the identity which has the base form and Ba da them is the first person singular past tense inflection and vowel harmony determines that it's dumb. Not Dumb. This is the indefinite conjugation. But for the first person singular past tense, the definite and indefinite forms are actually the same edge is the indefinite article. Got Album is the word for cafe with the NSF case ending bond. In other words, it's like a post position meaning him, and it's worth noting that this ending is bond, not Ben, because it's in harmony with the, Oh, at the end of Kava is old. As you can probably see, Hungarian is quite different from any Indo European language and it's different from any other language.

Speaker 2:          20:33          In Europe. It's a gluten native grammar and it's now in cases which functions somewhat like post positions are somewhat similar to other pheno eugric languages, but there are also differences and it contains much less Finnell eugric vocabulary than you might expect. But despite being different, Hungarian is really not as complicated as people make it out to beat. The noun cases aren't that hard to wrap your head around. If you think of them like post positions, vowel harmony isn't that hard to get used to because there are a limited number of variations and indefinite and definite conjugations work very logically. It just takes some time to get used to them. And other aspects of Hungarian are quite simple. For example, there's no grammatical gender at all and adjectives and articles are not inflected for case which makes dealing with the cases much simpler. The main point I'm getting at is that after digging into Hungarian a little bit, just enough to make this language profile, I've come away with the impression that it's not as complicated as I had been led to believe.

Speaker 2:          21:30          So if you're interested in the Hungarian people or the Hungarian culture or the country of Hungary, then don't be scared to start learning the Hungarian language as well. The question of the day to native speakers of Hungarian, what language or languages do you think share the most similarities with Hungarian and to learners of Hungarian? What aspects of the language have you found most challenging and what has been more straight forward? Be sure to follow Lang, focus on facebook, twitter, and instagram. And once again, thank you to all of my patrion supporters, especially the amazing ones right here on the screen. Who are my top tier patrons? So many thanks to them as always and to everyone else. Thank you for watching and have a nice day.
