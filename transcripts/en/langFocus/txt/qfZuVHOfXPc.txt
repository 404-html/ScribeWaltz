Speaker 1:          00:00          Philippians, I love the Philippines. I've been there three times already. I'm probably going there for a fourth time pretty soon. Good evening everyone. Welcome to my office space slash language lab. This is where I do my work. This is where I study when I'm studying a language. Um, and I wanted to talk to you about, uh, the next language that I'm thinking of picking up the language or the main national language of this place, which is Philippians. I love the Philippines. I've been there three times already. I'm probably going there for a fourth time pretty soon, so I thought it might be fun to learn a bit. It's a catalog. I don't actually have to really learn it because most people in Philippines speak English really quite well. Not everyone, but most people speak English well enough that I don't need to learn tagalog, but if I'm going to spend that much time in the Philippines then it would make sense to, to try to learn some of the language and just have some fun with it and see how far they take it.

Speaker 1:          01:07          My main project right now is French, so tagalog catalogs not going to be my main thing, but I want it to give it a go, have some fun with it and if I go back there numerous times, maybe I'll study and improve a little bit each time and just have that basic knowledge I can use. So let's have a look at how I'm going to do it. Where I'm going to start. Okay. We're going to jump right into my computer just like this. Here we go. Alright. So here we are inside my computer. You can see I'm on a page right here with this image of a pimsleur program. This is pimsleur Tagalog. Pimsleur is a language course that is all audio. You don't use any text. Usually you don't learn the grammar explicitly. You just, uh, you learned through listening and responding and repeating with the CD.

Speaker 1:          01:56          Now it, they market it really heavily and they, they talked like this one program will make you fluent and stuff, but it's not the be all end all. But I really like to use some kind of audio program at the beginning when I start learning a language because I want to get familiar with the phonology, the sounds, the pronunciation quite quickly, both for understanding them and for producing them. Uh, so I like to get some program like this so I can focus on the cds, learn them, go over them a few times if I need to. Uh, this one is 30 lessons, so it usually takes like a month if you do one lesson per day. Uh, but after I do the first couple of lessons and just get familiar with the basic sounds, then I'm going to, I'll keep doing this program. But after the first couple of lessons, I'm going to find a teacher so I can get some more practice producing the language and using it a building my oral communication skills.

Speaker 1:          02:50          So I'm going to use something called Iot Talky, which is a, it's a website that matches you with tutors or teachers of the language want to learn. So there's a scroll down the list here, a dropdown menu. You can find the language of your choice. Here is fulfilled Pino or Tagalog, so let's click on that and I want someone who also speaks English. That's most people in Philippines, so let's browse and see how many teachers are available. All right. We could see there are a lots of Gallo teachers available and the prices are very good. Fit for this is like five to $10. This is $5 per hour. This woman charges six to $9 per hour, basically about $5 per hour. So the prices are awesome because Philippines is a developing country, so to them maybe that's good money, but it's important to point out that these are our tutors.

Speaker 1:          03:48          They're not always professional teachers who give you a structured lesson, but that's what I want. I want someone to practice speaking with just so I can practice making sentences, practice getting exposure to the language that I hear and can produce it with someone and see if they understand. So it's all about building oral communication skills. So step one is get familiar with the sound. Step two is find a teacher. Start to produce the language and use the sounds and learn to understand them. In a speaking situation, another resource I'm going to use is this, this is the lonely planet Filipino or Tagalog phrase book. I really liked using phrase books when I start learning a language because they give me a lot of examples of very simple basic sentences so it gives me a good chance to internalize the sentence structure so I can just go over examples, examples, examples with simple vocabulary and then I can start to substitute some of the words, change out the words to make my own sentences following the same pattern of the sentence that's right in front of me and the book and also you have the English right next to the language so you can.

Speaker 1:          04:55          You can compare the sentences and figure out which words mean what in the other language. So that gives you a good sense of how to build sentences from their component pieces. So I really liked to do that phrase. Books are really useful if you use them correctly in that when I'm also going to use a more traditional kind of textbook. This one, Tagalog for beginners. I'm going to start with the kindle version just because I want to use it today and it comes with some audios as well. Uh, if I like it, I'll get the paper back because I generally don't like to get language books on kindle, but I just want it today, so I'm going to get it. This one according to the reviews as the best. I haven't looked at it, but I'm going to go for this one because of the reviews.

Speaker 1:          05:36          I like to have some kind of traditional textbook when I'm studying a language because it gives me a bit of that conscious understanding of, uh, of the language. So with the phrase book that can just do it on my own. I can figure things out, but they're always going to be times when I'm somewhat confused or I want some confirmation of what I'm. So these traditional textbooks usually give you the grammar and the vocabulary and all that with some explanation of how to use them and what they mean. So I'm going to have those components. I'm going to have the pimsleur for, uh, getting familiar with the sounds of the pronunciation. Then I'm going to find a teacher, start talking right away. Then I'm going to use the phrase book and I'm going to get familiar with the sentence structure and I'm going to do some traditional learning study a little bit in this textbook every day, so those are the things I'm planning to do. I'm going to get started and enjoy learning tagalog and we'll see how it goes. Alright, now it's time to edit this video. Let me move this down. Here we go. Let's move this one down here.
