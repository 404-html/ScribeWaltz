Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello everyone. My name is Paul and I'm from Canada.

Speaker 2:          00:08          Oh Shit. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:19          Hello everyone. Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and my name is Paul. Today we'll be going way back to see how we're all connected. Well, not all of us, but about half of us. Around 46% of the people on Earth speak an Indo European language as their native language throughout Europe, South Asia, the Americas and beyond. The Indo European language family contains languages as diverse as English, Hindi, Persian, Russian, Armenian, and Greek languages, which on the surface may seem to have nothing in common, but they actually do all Indo European languages developed from Prodo Indo European. According to the most widely accepted theory prodo Indo European was spoken around 6,500 years ago on the Eurasian Steppe of eastern Ukraine, southern Russia, and the Caucasus. The Indo Europeans were the first or among the first people to domesticate horses, which greatly increased their ability to travel and migrate over the following three Millennia.

Speaker 1:          01:16          Indo European people migrated far and wide, conquering new lands on horseback and bringing their language with them as it developed into different varieties, which eventually grew into different branches of the Indo European language family. The Indo Europeans first migrated into Europe, Anatolia, and Central Asia. Then later into northern India and Iran. As migration continued deeper into Europe and Central Asia. There's an alternate theory based more on archeological evidence that suggests that the Indo European languages began in Anatolia several thousand years earlier and spread with the expansion of agriculture. There are no written records of Prodo Indo European and it's early offshoots, so the best we can do is to theorize and imagine. However they happened to take place during these migrations, Prodo Indo European split into numerous different languages which would gradually developed into entire branches of the Indo European language family. Those branches are and a Anatolian, which is now extinct, tow Korean, which is also extinct Italia and Celtic, which may share a common he tello, Celtic ancestor, Armenian and Albanian, which each consists of just one language as far as we know, Hellenic Germanic, Balto, Slavic, which split into the Baltic and Slavic branches and into Iranian, which split into the ironic and indic branches.

Speaker 1:          02:33          All of these branches and their individual languages have been developing in different regions with different influences for thousands of years, so they are now very different from each other, but through comparative study we can see that Indo European languages share a common word stock as well as some phonetic. Again, historically speaking, some grammatical tendencies. There are a significant number of cognitive words in Indo European languages. By the way, the word cognate comes from Latin [inaudible], which means born together. These words were indeed born together in Prato Indo Europeans, and if we're aware of the sound changes that have taken place, we can identify cognates. For instance, the word meaning bear or carry. In Sanskrit, it's the hod. In Greek, it's pad. In modern Greek. This might be pronounced like an f sound, but in ancient Greek it was actually an aspirated pup sound. In Latin, it's fed in Gothic, it's by it.

Speaker 1:          03:26          In old English, it's bad. They all come from Prodo Indo European by head, and my pronunciation of these different languages is probably not perfect, but I'm just giving it a shot myself. I should point out that the Prodo Indo European words are theoretical reconstructions and that there's no way of knowing for sure what they sounded like, but these words here are fairly recognizable. Some are a little less recognizable. In English, we have the word work, which comes from old English. We had a, and in modern Greek, the word for work is edit goal, which was Aragon in ancient Greek and in some texts there was an alternate form whether gone, they both stem from the pro Indo European word, wedding film Indo European languages can be divided into two classes, the chem tomb languages and the sultan languages. [inaudible] is the word for 100 in Avastin, an ancient Iranian language.

Speaker 1:          04:17          Centum is the word for 100 in Latin. These two words illustrate a sound shift that occurred in Indo European languages. Prodo Indo European had a palatalized k sound that was distinct from the regular vilar k sound, a palatalized consonant sounds kind of like it's followed by a y sound like cure as opposed to cook in the Septum languages. This palatalized sound remained a separate phoneme from cup and it became a civil and sound like a sub or a show. So the Prodo Indo European word for 100 cutone became Chatam in Sanskrit, Shim Taz in Lithuanian, and in many Slavic languages. It's stole. These words have all developed and diverged quite a bit. But if you're aware of the sound shift from a k sound to an s sound, you can recognize these cognates more easily in the Ken tomb languages. The twoK sounds merged together, or in the case of the dramatic branch shifted to an h sound.

Speaker 1:          05:11          So cute. Tome became centum in Latin and hey catone in Greek cunt in Welsh and honed in old English. So let's take a look at these two words. In English hundred and sent, we usually think of hundred as a native Germanic word and sent as a lone word from Latin, but these are actually cognitive. First, let's take away the ending of the word ribbed, which comes from a suffix, meaning count or number that let's change the h back to a k and now you can kind of see the resemblance. See the resemblance. Remember that the sea in insent was originally pronounced like a k, Cook and Latin. Also, remember that d is the voice equivalent of tea, so you can often see these sounds alternating and related languages. Some core words have been preserved in many or even all Indo European languages. These include some animals.

Speaker 1:          06:02          For example, Prodo Indo, European equals. This means horse. You know that equestrian animal in Latin, it's equis. In ancient Greek, it was keep us. In Sanskrit, it's Ashford and in Persian it's aspect. The Latin and Greek examples are to him examples, but in Greek it seems that the k sound assimilated to the pcaob next to it. The Sanskrit in Persian examples are sought them. Examples, since you can see that the k sound became shuck and suck, it also seems that the w sound shifted to a v sounded Sanskrit and to uh, be sound in Persian and those are sound changes that take place frequently in various different languages. Other frequent cognates include the numbers from one to 10 words referring to family members, agricultural words and various natural phenomena like the words for tree and wood in Prodo Indo European Dodo or Dre, you in old English today, Ale in Gothic put a u in ancient Greek Dota, which actually meant spear in Sanskrit Daadab in old church slavonic don't evolve in Armenian zod this shared vocabulary.

Speaker 1:          07:08          It might be hard to spot when you're not looking for it, but when you start to notice the sounds that commonly alternate in those cognates, for example, the voiceless t and the voice deep, then cognit start to be more obvious. Indo European languages have developed so far from pro Indo European that grammatically they are very diverse and they have many features that other Indo European languages don't share. But because Prodo Indo European was a highly inflected language, all of its descendants are inflected language is to some extent by inflection, I mean that words change form to reflect grammatical functions like number person, tense mood case. One example is the verb endings we find in various Indo European languages in Prodo Indo European, the reconstructed singular forms for the verb to bear our pedal or the head of me, the head of seat, that a t and in Sanskrit the had Ami Darcy Bahati in Latin Fedele fetis fed it in old English better or Bentyl biddies biddies in many languages, including English.

Speaker 1:          08:15          These inflections have been lost to a large extent. In modern English, we only retained the third person inflection. He bears or she bears, but English still had the second person inflection until the early modern English period. So if you read a King James Bible, you'll see the sentence, thou barest record of myself. This is the second person form and val means you cases pro Indo European nouns had inflections for eight grammatical cases. Sanskrit maintained all eight cases and so did the ancient Iranian language of Estin Latin retained six cases and old English had for modern English. Nounce do not have case endings and that's also true for many other Indo European languages like most of the romance languages, when language is no longer have case inflections, the function of nouns is indicated more by word order and by the use of prepositions. But many modern Indo European languages do have numerous cases like most Balto, Slavic languages, which have six to eight cases, German and Icelandic, which have four cases and modern Greek, which also has four.

Speaker 1:          09:17          So the connection between the modern Indo European languages may not be obvious, but when we look back historically at how those languages have developed and the different stages of those languages, we can find more connections. The question of the day, if you speak in Indo European language, did you discover any new connections between your language and others during this video? Let us know in the comments down below.
