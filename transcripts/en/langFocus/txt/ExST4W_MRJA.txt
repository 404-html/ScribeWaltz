Speaker 1:          00:00          Follow lane, focus on facebook, twitter, and instagram. Hello everyone. Welcome to the Lange focus channel. Uh, my name is Paul. Today's video is the third installment in the mystery languages series. Maybe you've seen mystery languages one and two. If not, you can find them right here. But here's how it works. I'll play you a sample of a language and then I'll show you a written sample of the language and you can make an educated guess as to what that language is. And don't worry if you can't get the exact language correctly. The important thing is that you tell us your guesses and your reason for your guesses in the comments down below. And that will start a lot of interesting discussions. So let's get right into the first language. Please listen.

Speaker 2:          00:39          Yo, Miss [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] it's an example is [inaudible]. [inaudible] was purse.

Speaker 1:          00:54          Now let's see some written samples of that language. Kwong Costa show. This means how much is this Anisa lovable. This means where's the toilet bodily Mr pocket boxes plow. This means speak more slowly, please. [inaudible] this means could you write it please? So what language is it?

Speaker 1:          01:18          The language is Catalan, a romance language spoken mostly in eastern Spain as well as in Andorra and in part of France. If you guessed Spanish or Portuguese or another romance language, then you're not too far off. In fact, Katelyn has 85% lexical similarity with Spanish, but the two are only partly mutually intelligible. Catalan is part of the Occidental Romance sub family along with oxytocin. It's always interesting to take a look at a romance language that you're not too familiar with because you might see some features of one romance language and some different features from another romance language. If we look at the sentence again for three area, looks like the Spanish word for could this word [inaudible]. It seems kind of like a clear in French [inaudible] in Italian, which mean to write. And this phrase, see you plow seems like silver plate in front, so you can see why some people say that learning to romance languages helps you understand a fair bit of the others, at least in writing. Okay. Onto the next language. Please listen. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. And again, let's have a look at some written samples in Gemini. This means, how are you when said to a male [inaudible] work in decibels, this means pleased to meet you. Sim, my no, this means, what is your name when said to a male Aerosol Kaya to note, and this means, where are you from? So what language is it?

Speaker 1:          02:53          The languages? I'm Horic, I'm horic is a language spoken in Ethiopia by around 22 million people. It's a member of the Semitic language family, meaning that it's related to Arabic and Hebrew, but it's not intelligible with those languages. I've studied Hebrew and Arabic in the past, but I can't understand. I'm Arik at all. But there are a couple of cognates I can see in these written samples like the word for name Sim in Arabic, the word is Islam and in Hebrew it's Shim here and I'm horic summer is your name with the suffix being a possessive pronoun. In Arabic you'd say is muck and in Hebrew you'd say a Shim Heart. Also mum is the word for what? Which might be related to the Arabic word math and the Hebrew word mark. Okay. Onto the next language, please listen.

Speaker 3:          03:37          Kiva Gosiger very challenging. [inaudible] the unit mini van [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          03:54          and again, let's see some written samples of this language. This means pleased to meet you. I'm going to [inaudible] this means where are you from?

Speaker 3:          04:06          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          04:08          this means long time. No, see [inaudible]. This means have a good journey. So what languages it, it's the Tamil language. Tamil is the language spoken in southern India as well as in Sri Lanka as well as by Tamil communities overseas and places like Malaysia. And Singapore is a dravidian language, which is unrelated to the Indo European languages spoken in northern India. Tamil has a long literary history reaching back to around 2,600 years ago. The temple script is an aggregator, meaning a script in which consonants and vowels are written together as units, which can't be separated. Come to think of it, the [inaudible] script that we had a glance at earlier is also an avid reader. Well, I hope you had fun guessing today's mystery languages.
