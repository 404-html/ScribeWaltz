Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello everyone. Thank you for tuning into the lane focus channel. My name is Paul. Today we're going to talk about a common question related to language learning. Can adults learn a second language the same way that they learned their native language as a kid in a lot of the marketing surrounding different language programs and the courses that you can buy, you'll often see that you'll see them justify their methodology by saying this is the way you learned as a kid or when you were a kid, you didn't need written materials, you just listened and all that kind of thing, so I wanted to talk about that. Is it, is it actually possible and is it practical to learn that way when you're an adult? So let's get into it. First of all, adults learn differently from infants and toddlers. It's been proven through studies that there is definitely a critical age range after which it becomes more difficult to learn a language.

Speaker 1:          00:50          When you are an infant, you are using both hemispheres of your brain for language learning and that process, that way of learning usually lasts until you're about two years old and then it starts to change. It starts to become localized in your left brain and your right brain starts to be deemphasized. Now it doesn't happen immediately right away, but that process continues from about age two until you reach puberty, so around the time of puberty, so after you reach puberty, your language learning processes. Now a very left brain process, it's much more of an intentional. It's much more of an intentional kind of study rather than just an intuitive absorption of information from your environment. So it definitely does become different. Let me play devil's advocate for a minute. Let's just hypothetically say that yes, we can learn the same way that we learned as infants.

Speaker 1:          01:39          Is that practical? Should we learn that way? I would say that it's really impractical for an adult to learn their second language the same way they learn their native language because adults just have a very different lifestyle than little kids or infants do. When you're an infant, you spend about a year just sitting there listening to the language before you actually say anything, just absorbing the sounds. You're internalizing the phonology before you actually produce it. As an adult, do you have a year to sit around doing that? I know I don't. I have too many things. I want to study too many things I want to do and experience to many other languages I want to get to in the future. I don't have a year to just sit and listen, so unless you were an infant or maybe unless you're retired or unemployed and have nothing to do, then I guess a year of just sitting and listening is probably a waste of your time.

Speaker 1:          02:24          Am I right about that? Now, also related to time is this kid spent so much time in an immersive environment, 10, 12 hours a day, their whole waking life. They are surrounded by that language. When their kids at school, at home, in their environment, on tv, everything is in that language. Now you probably have a job that's in your native language. You probably have a circle of friends that speak your native language and your family probably speaks your native language, so do you really have 10 to 12 hours a day to be immersed in your second language and even if you are in that country, even if you moved to a country where that language is spoken, do you really have a circle of native speakers who are talking to you all the time, the same way that adults talk to babies or toddlers all the time.

Speaker 1:          03:09          When you're a toddler, people are trying to talk to you, right? They're trying to encourage you to speak and they're trying to help raise you by speaking to you, but when you're an adult, most people just don't really care that much. If you are going to learn their language to support you, but they're not going to sit there intentionally talking to you all the time just to give you an opportunity to practice. So you probably have like one hour a day, two hours a day, three hours a day. Whatever it is that you have to focus on that language, but you can't be immersed in it all day, every day, the same way that a child can, so that means that you have to strategize and use that time available to you in the best way that you can. So as adults we try to look for ways to accelerate our learning and one of the ways we do that is by cutting out things that we really don't need to learn right now.

Speaker 1:          03:52          So tell me this. When you learn a second language as an adult, do you really care how to say ladybug or how to say Choo Choo train, or do you care what the sound is that a bunny rabbit makes like boing, boing, boing, whatever it is, do you care about all the Onomatopoeia that appear in comic books like Bam, boom, smash, sap, Pow Kaboom, Kapow, splat? Do you care about all those sounds? Do you really need to learn those words in that language? Probably not. When you're an adult, you need to cut out the things that are not necessary and focus on what's most relevant to your adult life and it's probably not things that are relevant to kids a lot of the time now, this is partly a matter of efficient use of time, but it's also a matter of what kind of language is appropriate to use as an adult.

Speaker 1:          04:35          Now kids speak like kids and they usually speak that way for years and years and years until they become more influenced by the literary language and they start to speak more like adults who can be taken seriously, but you as an adult probably want to be taken seriously fairly early on, especially if you're using the language for work or for business. So you don't have 15 years to spend on speaking like a kid before you learn to speak more like an adult. Right? Yeah. So like I looked at the earnings report and stuff and it was really cool and stuff, but my boss was like, that's really dumb. As adults, we're at some disadvantages when it comes to learning a second language, but we also have some advantages and one of them is our ability to analyze what our learning needs are and to focus our attention on meeting those needs so you can look at your goals for the language, what situations you will use the language in, and then focus on what you need in order to achieve those goals, so that's your advantage.

Speaker 1:          05:28          You should use that advantage. You don't have to spend years and years building a base the way kids do in order to achieve your goals. Another thing that makes learning as an adult difference is that your self concept affects the way you learn. When you're a little kid, you are carefree. You don't worry about anything. You don't really have an ego yet. You don't think about your relation to the world and what's allowed and what's not allowed and things you can do, things you can't do. You don't really have that concept yet. You just do whatever the heck you want and as an adult you can't be like that. You have all of these layers of self concept that have developed throughout the years. You've developed an ego, you've developed a sense of your relation to other people into the world and you think, I can do these things.

Speaker 1:          06:11          I can't do these things if I do this thing, people will react a certain way. If I do this thing, people will react differently, so that causes a lot of mental blocks towards learning, especially when it comes to languages for some reason. If you think that you're not that smart or if you think that you're not that socially savvy so you can't communicate with people, you might self sabotage when practicing or learning a language, that kind of thing, or you might self sabotage because you think that it doesn't match your environment. Like if your friends are all into sports and they're all into music and you're into studying a language, maybe you'll be a nerd or maybe you'll be different than them. That kind of thing. You start to be conscious of that sort of thing. As an adult or as little kids aren't conscious of that.

Speaker 1:          06:55          They don't give a shit. They just do whatever they want and it's all about them. So in order to learn the way a kid learns, you kind of have to get back into that childlike headspace and forget about the world and just focus on yourself and it's hard for adults to do that. I mean in some ways, maybe we can learn from the way kids learn, but at the same time it's quite difficult. That doesn't really fit into the way we live and you would have to remove a lot of layers of your self concept in order to do that and that would take some effort. That's kind of a separate mission from here. A language learning mission, so it's much more practical in the short term as adults to set up a very intentional program of learning that can motivate you through some of those things that discourage you and actually push you forward so that we can do that through setting up a learning program and thinking about our goals and visualizing our goals and that kind of thing to.

Speaker 1:          07:46          Because we're going to have those blocks and we're going to have those times when we hesitate. Because of that self concept, as adults, we can get through that as kids. You don't need to, so we don't really need those strategies. So I think that's another big difference between adult learners and child learners, especially when it comes to languages for sure. So the hype that you can learn a second language, the way that babies learn their native language is exactly just that hype. Do you think babies learn their native language by listening to eight hours of audio on a language CD? Of course not. So take it for what it is. It's marketing hype. You can see through. It doesn't mean they're bad learning materials, but just don't buy into the marketing hype. Right. This is Lang. Focus on Paul. Thank you for watching. Have a good day. Bye now. This goes back to my first time visiting Egypt in 1997. I was in a backpack of resort called the hub and I met a number of girls who were there selling bracelets. They were selling little trinkets, souvenirs to tourists, like me, inner dialogue inside our head. It's kind of a voice that's constantly narrating our lives and commenting on what's happening around us.
