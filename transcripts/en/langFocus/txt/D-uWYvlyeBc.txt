Speaker 1:          00:00          Hey Paul, when are you going to finish? What do you mean? When are you going to finish talking about I talky? Oh, I'm already finished. Okay, good. Because you have a language video to make. Oh, that's right. What language does it today finish? Yeah, yeah, I'm finished. Hello everyone. Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and my name is Paul. Today I'm going to talk about the Finnish language. As you probably know, finish is the majority language spoken in Finland. It has about 5.4 million native speakers with 4.9 million of them living in Finland, which is about 90% of the population of Finland. It's one of the two official languages of Finland along with Swedish, which is spoken by about 5% of the population and there were also finished speaking minorities across the border in Russia, in Norway and in Sweden. You may have seen my video on the north dramatic languages.

Speaker 1:          00:50          It's this one right here and you might remember that I specifically excluded finish from that video. That's because even though Finland is a Nordic country with geographic and historical connections to Scandinavia, the Finnish language is not an north Germanic language. In fact, it's not even an Indo European language. It is part of the Finnish language group, which is a branch of the urologic language family. Other members of the finet group, our Estonian Cornellian, Ludic Vips, ingredient votech and Livonians, but finish is the most widely spoken language in the Finnish language group. All the Finnick languages developed from Prodo Finnick, which was spoken around 3000 years ago. The first stage was early Prodo Finnick. Then during the middle protal finnick period, some changes took place in that language and it's split into two protos Samak, the ancestor of the Cemak languages and late Prodo Finnick, which ultimately became the most recent ancestor of all the Finnick languages.

Speaker 1:          01:44          It's worth noting that finished contains a significant number of Germanic loan words, some of them which are clearly ancient in origin. For example, kooning gas, which means king do lead, which means chair, and it comes from the same root as stool and gold loops, which means school from words like these, we can see that the ancient fins had extensive contact with Germanic peoples. Linked Prodo Finnick diverged into three dialects, eastern Prodo, Finnick, northern Prodo, Finnick and southern Prodo Finnick. These three dialects of Lake Prodo finnick mixed with each other and the resulting mixes of influences developed into the dialects that make up the Finnish language. Around the 12th Century and 13th century Ce Sweden conquered Finland and made it a province of their country and for the next few hundred years, Swedish was the language of administration and during this time the middle low German was the Lingua Franca of commerce in the area and Latin was the language of religion.

Speaker 1:          02:37          Swedish and middle low German left an additional dramatic influence on finished, which during that time was strictly a language of daily communication. Finished did not really become a written language until the 16th century. When a finished bishop named Mikael Agricola created the first comprehensive writing system for the language. He based that system on the orthography of German, Swedish, and Latin, and it still forms the basis of the finished writing system today, although there have been changes since then. In 1809 Russia seized Finland from Sweden in a war and made it an autonomous state as part of the Russian empire. The official language and the language of the elite remained Swedish, but finished national feeling and a desire to make the Finnish language dominant began to increase in 1835 these feelings were amplified by the publication of culliver law or work of epic poetry written by alias Loon wrought with stories from carilion and finish folklore and mythology.

Speaker 1:          03:28          Luna [inaudible] also played an important role in the development of standard finish in 1863 finish became an official language in Finland alongside the Swedish language and they both remain official languages today and with a new sense of national identity emerging Finland eventually gained independence from Russia in 1917 before standard finish was created. The Finnish language consisted of a number of dialects that could be roughly divided into eastern and western dialects. The Western dialects are the ones upon which standard finish was largely based. From what I understand these days, the dialects mostly consist of differences in accent, but outside of Finland there are a few interesting dialects that are officially considered to be different languages even though they are intelligible with standard finish. This includes the Corelli in language and Russia may Anchia Lee, which is spoken by a Finnish minority and Sweden and Kevin, which is spoken by a minority in Norway.

Speaker 1:          04:20          So what is the Finnish language like? Well, it shares some features with the other members of the Finnish language group. Some of those features are no grammatical gender. There was no distinction between masculine, feminine or Neuter, not even in the personal pronouns. Hum. It means both he and she, and interestingly, Finland was one of the first countries to grant women the right to vote and it was one of the first to have a female president. So maybe gender equality is just built into the language and way of thinking. Hey, you never know. Next no articles. Articles are the words like [inaudible] or the in English. English speakers often wonder how you can communicate without those articles, but the context usually provides enough meaning that you don't actually need the articles. Next finish has some prepositions in English. Those are words showing location or relationship like two or apps or on, but finish has many more post positions.

Speaker 1:          05:10          These are similar to prepositions in function, but they come after the word that they add meaning to rather than before. Here's an example sentence with the post position already on Coppola. Guess Scala. The sentence means the market is in the center of town. Toady means market on is similar to his Kalpa me is town. The end at the end of [inaudible] is the genitive case showing possession and then after Kelp lumion we have cascadilla which is the post position, which means in the middle, so it's supposed to position because it comes after the now Kalpa me next, lots of grammatical cases, 15 to be precise. That means that now it's personal pronouns and adjectives have 15 different forms depending on their function in the sentence. We can't look at all 15 right now, but let's look at an example. Finish has the accusative case which marks a direct object and that's common in lots of languages.

Speaker 1:          05:58          It can be shown with an end at the end of the word or it can be shown with nothing just left blank at the end of the word, but there is also something called the positive case. This also marks a direct object. If the object is only part of a whole or if the action is incomplete or if the action is negative shift, go call on this sentence means will you eat the fish should means you eat. Cool. Here's a question. Marker. Color is fish and the end at the end of color is the accusative case showing that the action will be completed and that the whole fish will be eaten. Just cacala means do you eat fish? So again, shoot is you eat, cook, it's the question marker. Color is fish and the [inaudible] at the end of color is the positive case which shows that there's no completed action.

Speaker 1:          06:43          There's no completed action because there's no specific fish being eaten. This is just a general question. Next, you may have noticed in the above example sentences that the present tense and future tense are the same. That's right in finished. There is no future tense, but the future can be indicated in a couple of ways. When you see a present tense verb with an accusative case object like this that indicates the future because it shows that the action will be complete at some point. When you see a present tense verb with the part of the case like this, that indicates present tense because the action is not a completed action, so what must be happening now? The future can also be clarified with a time expression. Here's an example of demonstrating that there is no future tense in Finnish fluid. This means I read one woman.

Speaker 1:          07:27          This means I will read to moral who am in not means tomorrow, and that time expression is what indicates that this action will take place in the future. Next, there are a lot of long words and finish because of a gluten nation and because of compound words finishes in a gluten native language, meaning that words can be formed by attaching together pieces that add meaning to the word. Without those pieces changing, you just attach them together. In English we might use separate words like conjunctions and prepositions, but in finished special endings can be added to a word stem. Here's an example starting with the word for house.

Speaker 2:          07:59          Hello. Hello Sir. Hello, is sonny boy's soon again. Hello. So Nikki go

Speaker 1:          08:09          and the few additional features of finish. Number one, the main stress always goes on the first syllable of the word. Number two, there was no equivalent of the verb to have in finish. Number three finish has negative verb conjugations. That means that instead of using a negation word like not, it has an entirely different form of the verb to show that it's negative. Finish is clearly a very interesting language that might be quite different from the languages that you're used to speaking and learning. But it's finished as hard to learn as people say it is. Well, I can't tell you from personal experience, but it seems to me that if you've never learned a language from the finet group, we're from the your relic language family before, then you'll probably have to bend your mind a little bit to understand how that language works and that'll probably take more focus and effort then learning a language that's more similar to your own, but as is always the case, your passion, any language or culture will carry you through the challenges of learning that language. So if you're fascinated by finished, you really should go for it. Okay. The question of the day for finished speakers, how noticeable or the finished dialects today, can you tell where a finished speaker was from just by hearing them speak and a different question for people who've studied finish, how challenging is finished to learn? Did you find it quite tough or did you just find it different? Let us know in the comments down below. Thanks again to all my patrion supporters for your continued support and everyone else. Thank you for watching and have a nice.
