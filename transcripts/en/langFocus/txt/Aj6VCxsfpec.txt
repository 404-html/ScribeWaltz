Speaker 1:          00:00          Hi Guys. Today I'm going to talk about this book, teach yourself Arabic and I'm going to tell you whether it is a genius work of art or a piece of crap from hell.

Speaker 2:          00:16          Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:17          good afternoon guys. I'm going to talk today about a book and CD program that I used in the past to study Arabic. Uh, it's called teach yourself Arabic from the infamous teach yourself series a in it's this book right here by Jack smarts and Francis El Toro for or something like that. I don't know how to say his last name, first of all. That's a, I should say upfront. I want to be careful that we're talking about the same book. There are actually two books called teach yourself Arabic. This one right here is the old one from 1991. This one is basically focused on, uh, on receptive skills on reading and listening to Arabic. It's not really focused on conversational or communicative Arabic. That one is kind of universally lambasted by people who buy it because when they buy a teacher yourself booked, they're hoping to learn to communicate.

Speaker 1:          01:10          Most people, I think. And that book is basically based on um, reading and listening to the news in Arabic. That's really the purpose of that book. So we're gonna focus on this one, which is the new one published in 2001 and it has a much more community communicative, conversational focus and it's much more suitable for the average learner who buys teach yourself. So we'll talk about this. It's a pretty good book but it has some weaknesses. So I want to talk about those just to give you an idea and that will help you maybe use the book better. So first of all, the book is based on, well it's teaching you modern standard Arabic. That is the formal kind of Arabic, the standard Arabic that is used in newspapers. It's used in the media and it's used kind of as a tool to to communicate across dialects because Arabic has a lot of different dialects.

Speaker 1:          02:06          So when people want to communicate with a speaker of another dialect, they kind of, they incorporate some of the standard language into their speech to make it understandable for the other person. So this is, this is all about modern standard Arabic, but it teaches it in a way that is communicative, conversational and helps you to interact in daily situations. So that's kind of rare. There are some other books now that, that do the same thing, but a few years ago this was kind of the only, the only popular book like that, the only common book like that. And it was kind of rare to find in modern standard Arabic book that did that. Um, so it's good for that and it's good in the language that it teaches. Like if you look at unit one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, those they teach good language that's useful in daily situations in the vocabulary of presents I think is useful, presented in a logical order.

Speaker 1:          03:01          Um, it gives you a lot of experience with different language skills. So it's not only just the reading and the listening, but it gives you a chance to do some writing exercises and that gives you a chance to do some grammar exercises. It's got a good balance of skills, I find. Of course you're not speaking with someone, you're not. No one's listening to you and giving you feedback unless you have a private teacher. But it covers all of the bases to whatever extent a book like this can. So it is a regular teacher self book even though it's based on a modern standard Arabic. So it's good, uh, good in that sense. The strange thing about this book is that it switches gears suddenly, like the first seven units are based on good conversational situations, daily life situations. Then in unit eight it switches gears and throws you in head first into this traditional story about Sinbad, the sailor, and I think it's actually an authentic text from a book, from some old book and it's written in very kind of archaic Arabic and they throw you in head first and you're reading this going, wait, I haven't learned this stuff yet.

Speaker 1:          04:06          Why am I reading about Sinbad, the sailor using these archaic sentence structures? So I found that unit quite frustrating and it made me want to stop using the book to be honest, because there were things in that story that I couldn't find in this book that I couldn't find them in, uh, on the internet and Google as trying to s to search and find what these grammatical structures mean, but it couldn't. Um, so I think the idea that they had was to force you to, to understand the main meaning without understanding everything. But if they do that without explaining that, and they do that suddenly, even though the first seven units were kind of different than it's a shock to your system and you're going to get frustrated. So I found unit eight was annoying. Unit nine was similar because they threw you in to a bunch of advertisements, like the advertisements from a newspaper or a magazine.

Speaker 1:          05:00          Uh, and there were some apartment ads, like looking for an apartment and the exercises ask you questions and you have to answer it based on these advertisements. But the advertisements are full of words that you haven't seen before and it's just really hard to decipher them. Uh, and there's not a lot of guidance or explanation about the goal of that exercise. So if they had said like, do the goal here is just a scan for important information, don't worry about everything, then maybe it would be easier for learners to get through and not worry about the stuff they're missing. But it doesn't really do that. It just throws you in, you confused because you're expected to deal with all this language you haven't learned yet. So that's a weakness of this book cause that that element, it's written by two people and I have the feeling that uh, units one to seven were written by one person, unit eight and nine, and some of the others were written by someone else.

Speaker 1:          05:54          That could be true. I'm not sure. Um, later on in the book, some of the chapters get back to that communicative focus and that's good. But some of them are still unclear. And there were, there are some sections where you're thrown in head first without adequate guidance. I feel. Um, another weakness of the book is that at some vocabulary appears in the exercises or in the texts that is not taught. It's not given to you in the book and it's not in the glossary at the back of the book. So for, uh, for, um, a new learner who has just bought one of these books and doesn't have an arsenal of dictionaries and grammar reference books and stuff yet that's really frustrating. Uh, it's one of the most frustrating things to look in the glossary and not find the word you're looking for, especially when it appears in this book.

Speaker 1:          06:46          Um, they're also very simple words. I tried to look up, like I remember when I was using this book, I remember thinking to myself like almost every time I went to look up a word in the glossary, it wasn't there. Even when it was a really simple English word, I would look it up and it wouldn't be there. And I would always be thinking, why isn't that word in this book? Why isn't it in the glossary? That's such a simple, basic word. It should be in here. Um, so the glossary is not up to snuff, I think. Um, and they should really make sure that everything we're expected to, uh, expected to deal with. All the words were expected to understand it should be taught in this book. So they don't do that. To get around that, you need to have a good dictionary and to know how to look up words in that dictionary using the root or whatever the system is.

Speaker 1:          07:32          So get a dictionary and that will help you out a lot with this. So with that said, it's good. It's, it does teach good language and it teaches good situations and I think, um, uh, it, it teaches modern standard Arabic in a way that is useful for you to use as a communication tool. So just be prepared for those weaknesses if you get this book. Uh, just that there are some parts that throw you in head first without a lot of support. If you're an inductive learner, if you're someone who likes to figure things out without a lot of help, then you might enjoy that and just slugged through it and find that fun. Um, but if you're a more traditional deductive learner, and you like to get the instruction up front, and then, uh, no, everything that comes after that, then this book might frustrate you a bit, but it's good. I'll give it 3.5 stars out of five. Not the best, but not the worst. All right. Thank you for listening and have a nice,
