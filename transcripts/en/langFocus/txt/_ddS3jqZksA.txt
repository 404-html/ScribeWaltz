Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello everyone. Welcome to the Lange focus channel. My name is Paul. Thank you for tuning in. Today's topic is reactivating a language that you haven't used in a long time. A lot of colleague lights and a lot of language and fuzziest. They'll say things like ice be 15 languages or I speak 20 languages or you make your 30 or 40 or crazy numbers like that, and that can be really intimidating because most of us think I could never learn that many languages. I'm just a normal person. I don't have that much talent. But what most of those people are saying is that they have learned that many languages well during their lifetime. They usually can't switch between all of those languages whenever they want without taking some time to reactivate the language and kind of get back into it. So they kind of need some preparation time before they can speak that language again.

Speaker 1:          00:50          Now most people usually have some languages that are kind of in the front of their brand, their active languages that can switch between them. I think that's usually like three or four languages. I think it depends on the person and how often they use all of those in their life. But in my experience it's three or four. And in my observation of other people, it seems to be three or four the other languages aside from that kind of recede into the background and they'd become dormant. And in order to use those languages you have to reactivate them, get back into them. So if somebody said to me right now, okay, you're going to Israel tomorrow, you have to be able to speak Hebrew tomorrow, I would kind of panic because I haven't spoken Hebrew in about 12 years. So it would take me a few days, it would take me a week to take me a couple of weeks to get back into Hebrew to the point where I was confident speaking it, even though I would say that 12 years ago I was conversationally fluent in Hebrew and I could read it pretty well too.

Speaker 1:          01:42          I would still need some time to refresh my, my language skills and get back into things because it's receded into the background for sure. So how do you reactivate a language like that that's become dormant? Well, you basically need to just dive right back into it and see where your weaknesses lie and see what you can do and see what you can to do. And the best way to do that is by interacting with someone and using the language communicatively. Now, recently I did that at work. I realized that one of my coworkers is a native Hebrew speaker, so I tried having a conversation with him and Hebrew and I could do it kind of, but I realized that a lot of things that slipped my mind and I wasn't nearly at the level that I was 12 years ago, which is to be expected.

Speaker 1:          02:22          I wasn't surprised. I was actually surprised by how well I could speak Hebrew who had this point after 12 years of dormancy. But uh, that experience was important because it showed me, okay, these are the things I'm forgetting. These are the things that are not such a problem. The things that are usually the first to slip and go away. When the language becomes dormant is the vocabulary. Vocabulary goes away really quickly and sometimes it's even really basic vocabulary. You know, things like apple, things like car words like sleep and stuff like that often will just disappear from your, from your memory and it's in there passively. Usually usually your passive skills will kind of remain intact and when you hear those words you'll understand them, but when it's time to speak, they won't come up. I would say that that's definitely true for vocabulary and to some extent also for verb conjugations in my experience, but in my experience it's not that way for syntax or word order.

Speaker 1:          03:14          I don't really have any trouble building Hebrew sentences or making sentences in the language. It's mostly a problem of vocabulary and to some extent the verb conjugations. Usually there's also a kind of lack of fluency and it takes you longer to get the sentences out. I don't think that's a problem with the grammar or sentence structure though. I think that's typically a problem with vocabulary because you have these ideas you want to express, but you don't know how to bring up the words to express those ideas. So you slow yourself down in order to retrieve those words and look for the vocabulary to express what you want to say. And sometimes you end up paraphrasing or explaining it in a different way and that just slows down your fluency. I don't think it's a problem with her sentence structure. To me in my experience, that's usually something that sticks longterm.

Speaker 1:          03:59          Now assuming that you learned the language quite well the first time around, and by well I mean conversationally fluent, then it's basically a matter of refamiliarizing yourself with those things that you've forgotten so that they can become active instead of passive so that you can use them productively. You can speak using those elements and you can write using those elements, not just understand them when you encountered them. Sell the two steps of that are encountering those language elements passively with books or with videos and audio and then giving yourself a chance to use it. So I have some old Hebrew materials that are used to use back in the day that I can use to refamiliarize myself passively with some of these language elements. So I have this one Hebrew in three months. This one I think is out of print, but I really liked these in three months series by you go, they're all really good if you could find them online.

Speaker 1:          04:47          But this is the Hebrew one. Let me look at a sentence and just see if it reminds me of things that I've forgotten. Uh, it says here on this page and Neil Patella hood's a nickel, a chef shunted sally flatwoods. Key. O'Neil have Leo or backwards. Uh, so that means he's talking about a marathon and he says, I want to run and I think I need to run because I love being outside. Okay. Uh, probably that's all familiar to me. I wouldn't have forgotten any of those words. The next sentence, uh, a of Albert holds up. We laid low [inaudible] the Shabbat. Okay. So he says, but on the other hand when he says, but in any case, maybe I shouldn't because I had a cold on Saturday, so the word [inaudible] which means in any case, I don't think I would've remembered that unless I saw it written right here.

Speaker 1:          05:32          But now it's coming back to me just seeing it once and also the word Nazella, that means like a cold. I haven't thought of that word in 12 plus years, so I wouldn't have been able to pull that word up out of my memory and produce it. But now that I've seen it, I'm starting to remember cases when I used this word back in the day. So I think this is already being refreshed in my memory and I'll be able to use those words in the near future. Another book I used is this one mastering Hebrew, which is actually one of the FSI books, the free public domain ones that you can get for free on the Internet in pdf form. But the Hebrew one's good. Let me look at something in this. Let's see. Uh, he says there's a shot, a middleware, the ls there, Shiva, the Shiva is, and look dumb again.

Speaker 1:          06:18          And he'd say [inaudible] and they'll have the book. Okay. So he says, at what time do you get up? And the other guy says around seven and the first guy says, it's seven. That's early in. The second guy says, yes, I need to make breakfast for my family. So I'm most of those words, we're still kind of familiar to mix. They're quite basic, but the word mittal hour to get up, I don't think I would have been able to remember that. And now that I'm thinking about that word, I'm remembering other related works like shown malware shut on mail order that that's like an alarm clock, a clock that wakes you up. So I'm remembering related words and it's kind of becoming like a web. Like I remember one word. Then I remember related words and other things. And now I'm thinking of some sentences with that word that I made a long time ago.

Speaker 1:          07:03          So it all comes back when you just start to refamiliarize yourself with some things that have become dormant. So those are two textbooks that I've used in the past. I also like to use phrase books like this. This is the lonely planet Hebrew phrase book. These ones are quite good. I like the lonely planet. His books, they're good to just flip through and just read simple sentences, read simple phrases, and just review basic vocabulary because most of the vocabulary in here, his daily life vocabulary, it's quite practical. So it's good. It's a good way to just to get that core vocabulary back into your, your active vocabulary. So if I just opened to a random page, let's see if I can do it. It says, okay, uh, [inaudible] uh, can you write this down please? A Little Sean? I don't know if I would have remembered the word Leo Sharm without seeing it right here.

Speaker 1:          07:53          So, uh, I probably would have said like half Shah [inaudible] is it possible to rate this? I probably would have said let's solve instead of real sean. But when you're writing something down, like on a list, you just show them is the better word to use. So it's good that aside here, another example, let's see. Um, [inaudible] at the bank. Ah, okay. When do they open the bank? When does the bank open? Probably those words are okay. I would have remembered those materials when [inaudible] comes from pat documents to open. So I would've remembered these words, I think. But let's see if Shar Lao viola guns [inaudible] uh, can I transfer money here from my bank? So that one, I think I would've remembered most of those words except Leah via, which is to transfer. Um, but now that I've seen it, I'm remembering a speech that they saw by Benjamin Netanyahu on tv like 12 years ago where he said something like, uh, uh, good luck. Bye. [inaudible] new [inaudible]. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          08:58          means like, uh, this is his Zionist philosophy you said on there by bringing all the vast majority of Jews to Israel, can we fulfill the dream of Zionism? So she was saying bring, he said they hired via ems to transfer them here. So I just remembered that after seeing the word in this, this phrase book right now. So that's the kind of thing you can do. It just refamiliarize yourself with those language elements. And then you start to connect them with other elements that you've learned with other situations. You've used the men, and then you start to get that snowball effect. So that's one of the things you can do. Also, in recent months with Hebrew, I've been watching some, some youtube videos in Hebrew. Uh, that wasn't planned. It was just that I stumbled upon some interesting videos. There were street interviews done partly and Hebrew. So listening to the Hebrew passively reminded me of some of those language elements. So remember it a lot of vocabulary and it improved my listening skills again, but that's, I'll just riff familiarization. It's also important to produce the language, right? So I'm going to take some Hebrew lessons to get back into producing Hebrew verbally and we'll see how it goes. I'll probably just start practicing those elements that I've been reviewing and all of these books.

Speaker 1:          10:09          But sit, uh, Num Sheer Laguna Bezalel Oh, I'd see lockers or legal claims. Uh, I need any hot say, let's say l there's metal at the palm of our last shelf money and this amount. [inaudible]. So basically in conclusion, I just want to say don't feel that you have some kind of pressure to learn to be fluent in multiple languages and to always be able to speak them all the time. Most people who are language and fuzziest are polyglots there can't do that. They need to actually prioritize certain languages. Those are usually the ones that they're currently using, the ones that are currently relevant to their life. They're focused on using those ones and keeping them active. And the other ones they have learned in the past received them become dormant. But that's okay because if you ever need them, you just need a bit of notice and then you can reactivate them by re familiarizing yourself with some of the things that have slipped out of your memory and then producing them so you can get them back into your active language ability.

Speaker 1:          11:08          So don't sweat it. Don't feel any kind of pressure. Don't take on some kind of ego identity. Like, I need to speak all these languages because I'm a polyglot or whatever. It. Don't do that to yourself. Just relax and have fun. Enjoy the languages. No, that there will always be there. Especially if you've learned the language quite well, then it will always be there. You just need to re activate it, so don't even worry about it. All right, this is Paul. Thank you for watching. Have a good nights. When you're an infant, you spend about a year just sitting there listening to the language before you actually see anything. Just absorbing the salads. You're internalizing the phonology before you actually produce it as an adult that you have a year to sit around doing that. I know I don't. So I've been talking about focusing the grand sense, like in terms of your large goals and that kind of thing, but of course the focus is also important in the moment because we live in such a distraction prong world.
