Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello everyone. Welcome to the Internet and my name is today we're going to look at the differences between Chinese and Chinese. Well, what I mean is we'll be looking at two of the many Chinese languages, Mandarin and Cantonese. As I mentioned in my video on Chinese. Chinese is not a single language, but rather a number of dialect groups that are united by a common writing system. The spoken languages are different and generally mutually unintelligible, which is definitely the case with Mandarin and Cantonese, which are both Semitic languages or Chinese languages spoken in China. Mandarin is spoken by 960 million native speakers, mainly in the north of China, but as now used all over mainland China and Taiwan as the official language of government, media and education, and it's one of the four official languages of Singapore as well. Cantonese on the other hand is spoken by 50 to 60 million native speakers in Hong Kong. Macau go on zillow and some adjacent areas as well as in Chinese diaspora communities around the world. It's part of the wider UAA branch of Chinese. Before we get into the main room.
