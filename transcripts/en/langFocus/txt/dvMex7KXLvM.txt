Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello everyone. Welcome to the Lange focus channel. My name is Paul. Today I want to talk about knowing your learning style. Most people rely on other people or on their materials to teach them, but I want you to be empowered and to be able to direct your own language learning. That's why today we are going to look at your learning style and how to use it to learn more efficiently. Different people learn differently. We all have a unique learning style that is based on the type of sensory information that we prefer. These kinds of sensory information are called learning modalities and there are four of them. Some people say three, I'm going to say for they are visual, auditory, reading and writing and kinesthetic. You can remember those learning modalities based on the acronym Mark V, a r k students generally have a dominant modality, but they do use a combination of all the different modalities. Some people will say, for example, I'm a visual learner, but really what they mean is that I am primarily a visual learner with some of the other modalities as well. There are some people who don't really have one strongly dominant modality and they call those people.
