Speaker 1:          00:00          Quiz time or the following words? Chinese or Japanese first? Yes, it's Japanese next. It's Chinese. Next. Actually this is both Chinese and Japanese and finally, actually this is neither. This is ty. What you thought. All Asian languages are the same.

Speaker 1:          00:25          Hello everyone. Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and my name is Paul. Today's topic is the question how similar our Chinese and Japanese, a lot of people look at a map of Asia and see how close to Japan and China are or they might look at a sample of Chinese and Japanese writing and think that something looks similar and they might conclude that the two languages are similar, but are they really similar? Well, the short answer is no. They are completely different languages, but Japanese has been highly influenced by Chinese and it's vocabulary and then it's writing systems. Chinese and Japanese do not share any common origin and they don't belong to the same language. Family, the Chinese languages belonged to the CNO, to Betson language. Family in Japanese as far as we know belongs to the Japonica language. Family phonology. First off, the phonology of the language is, is very different with the most basic difference being that Chinese is a tonal language.

Speaker 1:          01:13          While Japanese is not a tonal language is one in which there are tones or pitches that helped determine the meaning of the words you use if you use the wrong tone than the meaning of the word changes. Here's an example, the word for teacher sure. And the word for naive slow. Sure. And the word for old fashion. So I'm sure that Chinese teachers get called naive and old fashion all the time by mistake or maybe not by mistake. In Japanese, there are basically no tones like this that determine the meaning of words. In Japanese, there is something called pitch accent, which means that the syllables of a word have either a higher pitch or a lower pitch, but they're not like the tones and Chinese because they typically don't determine the meaning of the word. They're more like stress. In English structure, the structure and grammar of the two languages is completely different.

Speaker 1:          02:01          At the most basic level, Chinese is an Svo language, while Japanese is an Sov language. Here's an example in Chinese. Sure. This means he speaks Chinese and you can see s the o subject verb object and here's that sentence translated into Japanese, how they walk to go google on Nasim us here we can see s o v subject, object, verb and you can see there are some extra little words in Japanese that don't exist in the Chinese sentence. For example, Japanese has the topic marker Wa which doesn't exist in Chinese and Japanese also has the object marker all which doesn't exist in Chinese. Chinese is an analytic language, which basically means that you create a sentence by a placing independent elements side by side. Analytic languages like Chinese do not use inflection. Inflection means modifying words to indicate some kind of grammatical meaning like plural, gender, tenths or case.

Speaker 1:          02:55          You don't change any part of a word in order to change its meaning. Instead, you can add to the meaning of that word by adding an extra word next to it. Japanese, on the other hand, it's an a glutinous of language that uses inflection. A gluten native language is used a lot of affixes. Rather than just placing independent worlds side by side, you attach additional pieces to words to add or modify. Meaning this kind of inflection in Japanese means that Japanese words are often longer than Chinese words and that it may take a few words in Chinese to translate one Japanese word. In these Chinese sentences, we can see that there's no inflection or this sentence means I go to school or choose this sentence means I went to school, so no part of the verb is changed to indicate the past tense. We can show the past tense by just adding a time expression.

Speaker 1:          03:42          Now these similar sentences in Japanese show inflection. The sentence means I go to school [inaudible] I went to school. Once I see what [inaudible] does and the polite form of I go to school [inaudible] I want to go to school. What does she wear? De Gaulle, achy tie. In this Japanese example, we use inflection, changing the word to the Eqi form, and then we use a gluten nation to attach a form that shows intention tied in Chinese though there's no inflection or agglutination, you just add an extra word like this. That's just a brief sample of how different the grammar is in Japanese and Chinese. Basically they're completely different languages when it comes to their grammatical structure, vocabulary and Chinese characters. The one area in which there is some similarity between Chinese and Japanese is in vocabulary and in the use of Chinese characters. During a period of great Chinese influence between the fifth and ninth century Ce, there was a huge amount of borrowing from early middle Chinese into Japanese.

Speaker 1:          04:37          Japanese originally had no written form, so Chinese began to be used as the literary language and as the language of science and religion, Chinese vocabulary began to be borrowed into Japanese and the Chinese writing system was gradually adapted to fit the Japanese language. So not only were at vocabulary board, but the Chinese characters that represent them were also adopted. 60% of the vocabulary words used in Japanese are of Chinese origin. But that includes all of the words in the dictionary. And that includes a lot of very specialized academic and formal vocabulary that's mainly used in writing and spoken Japanese. The number of Chinese loan words used as much lower at about 18% the borrowed words were almost all Chinese nouns, even though in Japanese they might be used as verbs or as adjectives. That's just one way in which the vocabulary is used differently. But also with the pronunciation of those Chinese words that were borrowed into Japanese changed to match the Japanese phonological system.

Speaker 1:          05:27          And that included the loss of the tones of those words. And also these words were borrowed a long time ago, which means that the words have also changed in pronunciation in Chinese. So the pronunciation has diverged quite a bit, meaning that modern Japanese pronunciation and modern Chinese pronunciation of similar characters or words is quite different. And it's also important to point out that mandarin was not the standard form of Chinese back in those days when those vocabulary words were borrowed into Japanese. So even at the time they were borrowed, the pronunciation was different from standard Chinese today. And what I understand, the modern Japanese pronunciation of those lone words is often more similar to modern cantonese than it is to Mandarin. These examples show how the same words are pronounced very differently. In Japanese ended Mandarin, the word for family in Japanese, it's cut date and actually in Japanese the meaning is more like household or home and in Mandarin Jab him.

Speaker 1:          06:17          Next, the word for death in Japanese, she bolt and amendment to the wall next to word four season in Japanese key set to and in Mandarin Gpa and the word for home country in Japanese vocal group and in Mandarin or so you can see that these words look the same and they have basically the same meaning, but they sound very different. So Chinese vocabulary represented by Chinese characters were borrowed into Japanese, but those Chinese characters were also them applied to native Japanese vocabulary that had a related meaning for those Chinese loan words. That means that a Chinese speaker can often look at a native Japanese word and understand its core meaning without knowing that Japanese words, because the Chinese character is used to represent it. So Chinese people can often read a text in Japanese and they can make sense of the basic meaning of it based on the Chinese characters, but they won't understand all the details.

Speaker 1:          07:07          And the same is true in reverse. Japanese people can look at a Chinese texts and kind of make sense of the meaning of it based on the Chinese characters that they know. But it is easy to misunderstand the details of what's written, especially if they have zero knowledge of the other language. Here are some Japanese example sentences that have the same Chinese characters, but the meaning is very different because of the inflection that's used. Nicole [inaudible], that means the cat eats fish, Nicola suck and [inaudible]. That means the cat doesn't eat fish. Nicola suck. Another topic. That means the cat ate fish in the past tense. Nicola [inaudible] Samadhi, the cap plans to eat fish. Nicola [inaudible] data. That means the cat was eaten by a fish. So a Chinese speaker of reading these sentences would get the core meaning of the Chinese characters, but they would miss some meaning in the inflection.

Speaker 1:          07:53          For example, the negative or the past tense or intention or the passive form. Especially. The last example could be highly misunderstood, so imagine you're an English speaker reading something with English long words. It might look something like this, Catholic glofish, blah, blah, blah. Of course, even after just a little bit of study in Japanese or Chinese speaker could probably learn enough to understand basic Japanese sentences like that. For me, as someone who's studied Japanese two, a relatively advanced level, the same as true in reverse. When I was in Taiwan last year on the subway for example, I could read a lot of the advertisements and I would get most of the meaning. I wouldn't understand all of the Chinese characters, but I would get usually three out of four of them and the fourth one would be new to me because in Chinese there are a lot of characters that actually aren't used in Japanese at all, but just getting three out of four of them was often enough to understand the basic meaning of that advertisement.

Speaker 1:          08:41          But of course I had no idea how to pronounce those Chinese characters and if I tried to read them out loud like the Japanese, I would hear laughter from both my girlfriend and from local bystanders. It might seem strange that I can look at a Chinese character in Chinese and understand what it means without knowing how to say it, but think of it as a symbol, like a number. The number seven right here is pronounced differently in different languages, but when you see it, you know what it means, no matter how you pronounce it. Chinese characters are kind of like that except that they represent a much wider range of meanings. The Chinese characters used in any particular sentence can be very different from those used in the other language for a sentence of similar meaning and in Japanese there are a lot of compound words that were created from Chinese characters, but those compound words don't actually exist in Chinese.

Speaker 1:          09:23          These are called Wasa Congo, which means something like Chinese vocabulary created in Japan. Here are some examples of Wasa icon will, some were created to represent things unique to Japan, like Ninja Geisha and others were created during the Meiji period to represent western concepts like democracy, men shoes. So even though you might recognize a lot of characters when you look at some texts in the other language, they might be used in a very different ways. So the meaning will be unclear. A Chinese speaker might be confused by Wasi Kango when they tried to read some Japanese and Japanese people might be confused when they read Chinese because there are a lot of Chinese characters that were never boiled into Japanese in the first place or they're not used in modern Japanese. But in either case, even basic knowledge of the other language would help in reading comprehension quite a bit.

Speaker 1:          10:09          Japanese returned moen words in Chinese, so as we've discussed already, lots of Chinese vocabulary was borrowed into Japanese, but some Japanese vocabulary has also been borrowed into Chinese. A moment ago I mentioned Wasa Kango, Japanese vocabulary created from Chinese roots vocabulary that didn't exist in Chinese, but some of those Lasa Kango have actually been borrowed from Japanese into Chinese. Some sources say that such vocabulary accounts for around 30% of modern Chinese vocabulary. Of course, the way those returned loan words are pronounced as based on the modern Chinese pronunciation of the Chinese characters. Here are some examples. The word for history in Japanese that Kishi in Mandarin, the shoe, the word for industry in Japanese Kogel in mandarins, the word for electron or electronic in Japanese. Then cheat in Mandarin and the word for injection in Japanese to shop in Mandarin jewel. Sure. The word for philosophy in Japanese. Tetsu got goats in Mandarin.

Speaker 1:          11:10          Yeah, the workforce system in Japanese, Cato and in Mandarin. She told him, and most Chinese people these days are probably not even aware that those words were borrowed from Japanese. It's also important to point out that in mainland China, simplified Chinese characters are now used as opposed to the traditional Chinese characters used in Taiwan and Hong Kong. That means that someone from mainland China may have some more trouble recognizing Japanese Kanji than someone from Taiwan. For example, someone short, Chinese and Japanese are very different languages, especially the spoken languages. Even though there was a lot of vocabulary borrowed from Chinese in the Japanese and the little bit from Japanese into Chinese, only in writing are those two languages somewhat intelligible because of the Chinese characters that are used. So the question of the day for Japanese speakers, what's your experience when you look at Chinese texts, are you able to understand the basic meanings based on the Chinese characters and similarly for Chinese speakers? What happens when you look at a Japanese texts? Can you understand the basic meaning or do you get confused because of the different way that the Chinese characters are used? Thanks again to all my patrion supporters and I want to say thanks to all the new subscribers who joined this month. There are a lot of you and you are very welcome and very appreciated. Thank you for watching. Have a nice.
