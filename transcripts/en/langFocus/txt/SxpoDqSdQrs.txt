Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello everyone. Welcome to the Lange focus channel. My name is Paul. Today I'm going to be talking about a language learning tool called memorize. I tend to be a traditional kind of learner. I focus on using textbooks on audio listening materials are not communicating with native speakers. Those are the staples of my typical study routine, but a lot of people ask me about things like memorize. So I decided to give, memorize a try and give you my review and tell you my impression. So first of all, what is memorize? Well, memorize is a language learning platform that's available on your desktop computer or on your smartphone. And it is basically a system for memorizing using flashcards with a spaced repetition system. So it's similar to something like [inaudible] in which you use a flashcard and to learn a word and then you review it at graduated intervals.

Speaker 1:          00:49          Those intervals get longer each time you review the word, so maybe the first time you review it two minutes later, but then after that the next review comes 10 minutes later, the next one comes 30 minutes later, that kind of thing. So you're increasing the interval between the reviews of the flashcard each time. That's what I mean by a spaced repetition system memorizes used primarily for language learning, but you can use it for other kinds of information to like geography or biology or whatever information you could put on flashcards. You can make flashcards and use them in the memorized system. One of the pillars of the memorize approach is science. They claim to have a lot of legitimate science behind their approach behind their technology with one of the founders of memorize being a neuroscientist and the other one being an award winning master of memory, someone who's won a lot of memory contests, that kind of thing.

Speaker 1:          01:39          The science of memorize focuses on two things in coding and testing. So the first thing that memorize is focused on is encoding new information into your memory. And that is done by using something called memes. What memes are is they are kind of multimedia bits of information that can help you connect to that new information to something you already know. So it could be an image. So you're associating that new phrase or a word with an image that is familiar to you. It could be a funny sentence or a shocking sentence, something like that. It could be a mnemonic device. Any of these kinds of things that can help you connect that new information, make some connections and retrieve that memory later. Those can be used as memes.

Speaker 1:          02:24          If you're an experienced language learners, and you might be good at coming up with memes of your own off the top of your head, but if you're not, or if you just need extra ideas, then you get these memes within the memorize system that are provided for you. So those memes are for the purpose of encoding new information into memory. The second scientific principle that memorize this, focused on his testing. So after you have encoded that new information as a memory, then the next thing is to test yourself. That is to prompt yourself to recall that information later on before you forget it. And when you do recall that information, that strengthens the memory. Okay, next I'll talk about the content. And by that I mean the courses and the flashcards that you can learn from inside the memorized system. Memorize content is organized into courses and each of those courses consists of a bunch of flashcards and those courses are created by memrise users.

Speaker 1:          03:18          They're not created by the founders of memorize or their employees, the created by you, the people who use memorize. So anyone who has the desktop version of memorize can create a course anytime they want. And that means that there's a huge variety of courses available. There are tons of courses on memorize. Okay, so I'm going to talk about the positives and the negatives of memorize. And then after that I'll give you my final thoughts in summary on this tool for language learning. So the positives, number one is just the sheer number of courses available. The amount of content on memorize is staggering. If you look at the courses available at the languages available, there's just tons and tons to choose from. So it's like being a kid in a candy store. It's really a lot of fun just to browse through there and think about what course do you want to try next.

Speaker 1:          04:04          So let's take a look at the selection inside. Memorize plumps. Here we are on the memorize homepage, and if I click on the courses button over here, we'll see some of the featured courses on the front page. So we have learned basic Russian learn, basic Brazilian, that et Cetera. So at least ones are particularly popular. So they are featured on the front page, but these are not the only language courses available. Let's look at the left hand sidebar and see some of the others. So this is, these are the top categories, the most popular languages, but look down below that and we can look at all categories. So you see there are some other subjects like Trivia and memory training, history, geography. But let's look at languages looked at that. We've got all languages or language is broken down into regions. So let's click on for example, African and see how many languages there are.

Speaker 1:          04:52          You can see there's a big long list of African languages, Zulu, Kosa, Wallace, Somali. There's all these languages. Let's have a look up above at, let's see, Asian and Pacific. Let's see. So a lot of the Asian languages are here. Indonesian, Korean, Thai, Vietnamese. So even I knew even the, I knew language from Japan, which is a very endangered language even nowadays. So there's a lot of languages that are much less widely studied that courses are available for it. Let's choose a language and click on it just to see the variety of courses that you can get just for that one language. So let's click, let's not click the top one because that would be too obvious. Let's click, let's see, how about Italian? Let's go for that. So we've got learn basic Italian, I don't know exactly what it consists of, but it says learn Italian vocab and grammar verbs, phrases.

Speaker 1:          05:44          And down here, let's see, intermediate, Italian, Italian verbs and expressions, introductory Italian, the 500 most common Italian verbs, hacking, Italian, elementary, Italian. So these are all different courses by users. Some of them might cover similar things, so you probably don't want to do all of the courses, but there's a lot to choose from, which is part of the fun of looking around inside memorize, so you don't have to start at the beginning and follow a linear path with any kind. Of course, you can jump around and skip around a little bit. You can do multiple courses at the same time. It's really up to you. It's nice to have that flexibility. Okay. The second positive thing is that the system of encoding and testing, it's quite effective in my opinion. I tried out some to gallows and French courses, but I also tried out a Turkish course because Turkish is a language that I've never studied and I got a chance to see how it feels to learn a language from scratch using memorize.

Speaker 1:          06:36          I didn't get really, really far with that course. I just did a few lessons in it, but I had a chance to see how well I remembered things and I felt that I remembered the words quite well because I was prompted to recall the words at times when I was just about to forget them. And that's actually really good in spaced repetition and the goal is that you want to retrieve the word right before you forget it because the more effort it takes to recall and retrieve that word, the the more you will strengthen that memory. So it felt like the memorize system had really strategically timed when I needed to review that word right on the edge of forgetting it, which is good. I also found the memes quite useful. I'm an experienced language learner. I'm pretty good at coming up with my own memes.

Speaker 1:          07:18          But having a bunch of crowdsourced memes to choose from makes it just really easy and quick. And sometimes you see one that really you connect with and you want to use more than your own, and that just makes everything easier and smoother. So so there, why not? It's useful. Okay. So now for a couple of negative things, the first negative point is that memorize is not really a comprehensive language learning system. It's basically a flashcard drilling system with spaced repetition. So it's not something I would use to learn a language completely from scratch all by itself. You don't really get any explanation about the grammar or phonology or anything like that. So sometimes when it's practicing with memorize, I would be looking at a word and thinking why are the letters pronounced this way? I would, I really would like to have some explanation of the phonology or things like that.

Speaker 1:          08:04          But of course there is none. So I'm pretty good at to do sing that stuff from examples just from experience. And that's the way I think. But I think a lot of people really need to have that explanation. And even for me, it's good to have it. It makes it easier. So just the lack of explanation and that was the lack of presentation of the language concepts makes it less than a full language learning course. It's really just drilling vocabulary of phrases and translation of sentences. So that means that basically you should use memorize along with another course that is more comprehensive. Okay. The second negative thing is that the user generated courses are both a blessing and a curse. Like I said before, they're a blessing because there's such an, an awesome amount of variety and such a selection to choose from. But at the same time, there's not really a lot of quality control and there's no standardization of the courses.

Speaker 1:          08:52          Some of them are a lot better than others. Some of them seem to introduce words in a really strange order or they start with things that in the beginning that you don't need yet and that kind of stuff. So I found that I really had to search around and try a few different courses to see which one fit my needs and then if it didn't fit my needs, just leave that course and join a different one. So you have to look around, shop around a little bit before you decide what course to use. So that's a little bit different than some other language learning platforms that have been kind of refined and standardized more so that you kind of always know that you're getting a course that they themselves have developed and focused on. Basically to sum up my positives and negatives, I would say that memorize is actually a really useful tool for drilling vocabulary and for drilling sentences and maybe doing some sentence to sentence translation and it's a fun tool to use so it's good as a supplement.

Speaker 1:          09:41          It's good to get that extra source of input of the language. It's just a useful tool but it's not a comprehensive language learning program so I wouldn't stick to only memorize unless you're just dabbling in a language on the side. Like if you're focused on French and you want to learn a bit of Portuguese, then just use memorize. For some Portuguese that would be fine. But if you are really taking a language seriously, I would have a comprehensive main course and then use memorize as an extra additional helpful tool, which it is. So that's all from my impressions. But how about you? Have you tried memorize? If you have, then I ask you to leave your comments down below. Tell me what you thought of it, was it useful for you? And if you have some tips on how to use it more effectively, then please write that as well. Thank you very much for watching the langue focus channel.
