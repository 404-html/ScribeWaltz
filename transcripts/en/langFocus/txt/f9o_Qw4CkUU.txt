Speaker 1:          00:03          Hello everyone, thank you for tuning into the lane focus channel. My name is Paul. Today's topic is the Fsi free courses that are available online. So what does the Fsi that is the foreign service institute and that is where American diplomats or foreign service workers do their intensive language training before they are placed abroad. Now why does that matter to us to language learners? Will it's because the Fsi materials, at least the older Fsi and materials that they use for their intensive language study are available in the public domain and you can get them on the Internet for free. So that's very relevant to us. Anything that's free makes us pay a close attention, doesn't it? Well, you can also get them in hard copy format. You can get some repackaged versions like this. This one is called mastering Hebrew, but this is actually the Fsi Hebrew course.

Speaker 1:          00:53          Just some, uh, some entrepreneur repackage them and decided to sell it. I also have this one mastering French and I have this one which is called. It's just Saudi Arabic. This is the Saudi Arabic of course from the FSF. So you can buy them in hard copy format if you are willing to spend some money, if you want the free one or if you want to try them, then they're public domain, find them on the Internet and I'll give you a link where you can find them later. So let's talk a little bit about the pros and cons of these FSI materials. First of all, the pros, the first thing is there are free. So how can you go wrong with free materials? Even if they suck, then you stopped using them and you've lost nothing, right? So you can download them, try them out, see how it goes.

Speaker 1:          01:33          They're free. What more could you ask for? The second thing is that they are quite dense courses. There is quite a lot of material that you can use that you can get through there. The Hebrew one is about 550 pages. The French one, well this is only one quarter of it right here on this in this volume, but this is 250 pages. It's altogether, it's 900 or a thousand pages and the Arabic one is 250 pages, so there's quite a lot of material for you to use and there's hours and hours of audio to go with it, so it's just a lot that you can use. If you do work through that material, you'll gain a good working knowledge of the language that will probably also be very good for your sentence level fluency because they just drilled the hell out of you. There are so many drills in these courses and there are question and answer drills, substitution drills, transformation drills, just drills, drills, drills.

Speaker 1:          02:18          Not all the time but a lot of the time and it really helps you just spit out the sentences more quickly. It really helps improve your fluency and to produce sentences on the go when you need to so you don't have to spend as much thinking time to produce your sentences. After finishing the FSI Hebrew course, there was a huge jump in my fluency. I could produce sentences much more rapidly. I actually studied with the Fsi course between two trips to the Middle East. On the first trip I couldn't really produce sentences very quickly and on my second trip there, after using the Fsi course, everybody told me, wow, you speak like a native speaker. I guess they're flattering me a little bit, but basically doing so many drills helped me to to speak fluently and without lot of pausing and hesitation. They're also good because the language presented is based on everyday common situation.

Speaker 1:          03:05          Things like meeting someone for the first time, ordering a ticket at the station, inviting someone out, that kind of thing, talking about the weather. Those are the way they introduce the language at the beginning of the lessons and then after that they expand upon that by drilling the hell out of you, but they introduced the language using those common situations so everything you learn is quite useful and relevant and it's thematically based in each chapter, so that helps you remember all of the new material you're learning now for the cons or the bad. These courses are mind numbingly boring. At least some of them and at least at times they can be really, really drill intensive and I remember sitting there in the middle of these courses sometimes just counting down the minutes saying, okay, 10 more minutes, 10 more minutes, I'm almost done, and just praying for the end because they really are boring.

Speaker 1:          03:50          You need to be motivated yourself. These courses will not motivate you. They're really dry a lot of the time and you just have to push through them and that requires you to bring your own motivation to the table. Another downside is that the audio materials are just not that high quality because they were produced in the 19 sixties and seventies quite a long time ago and the new cds that you might get are still based on those original master tapes. So sometimes they're not clear, they're a bit fuzzy and they're just not really. They're not really as good of a model as a digital audio recording would be a modern recording, so I would recommend that if you do use these Fsi materials, you get some other more modern digitally recorded audio materials so that you can copy the pronunciation of a native speaker clearly.

Speaker 1:          04:33          Right. Another downside is that these courses are not really made to be used as standalone materials. They're made to be a manual for a classroom course that is taught by an instructor and the instructor in these courses is supposed to give you extra activities that help you get more interactive experience and sometimes in some of the books you can see notes to the instructor like, please do this, please prepare an activity for this purpose and that kind of thing. But obviously those activities are not in the book. They were up to the instructor of the classroom course. So these books don't come with a classroom course. You have to get that experience, that extra component that the teacher would be responsible for. You have to get done on your own, so really you need to just get experience communicating and interacting with native speakers. You need to take some lessons.

Speaker 1:          05:19          You get to talk with friends who speak that language, just do that in addition to these courses, so in conclusion, most people find these Fsi courses really just too boring to drill intensive, but I do marginally recommend them for people who are just having trouble with fluency and having trouble with sentence structure. People who take a long time to think about their sentences and piece them together. If you want to gain that automaticity, that fluency, then you want to just practice with some drills. These are really good for drills. That's basically the main thing I recommend them for and if you want to just be able to spit out sentences more quickly than by all means try these out. Check out their drills, but bring your own motivation to the table because these are boring and also just be prepared for some unclear audio. Don't expect 2015 level audio quality for because you won't get it. So supplement with some other audio that you can model your pronunciation after. Thank you for tuning into the length focus channel. Have a good night. Talk to you later. Something that has been all the rage recently, something called duo lingo. Now this is a totally free language learning platform. It has a online desktop version and also a smartphone version. It's quite good. Um, I like it, but I think it's quite expensive and that seems to be one of the common complaints is just the price.
