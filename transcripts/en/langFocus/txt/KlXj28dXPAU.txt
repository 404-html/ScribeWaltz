Speaker 1:          00:06          Hello everyone. Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and my name is Paul. Today's topic is a language that some of you have probably never heard of, but it's a fascinating topic and one that's definitely worth a look. The topic is catch you up and then catch you up. The language is sometimes referred to as Luna see me, which means the people's language. If we include all varieties of catch you up. It is by far the most widely spoken native language in South America with between eight and 10 million speakers spread out across Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador, as well as northern Argentina and southern Columbia. Spanish is now the dominant language and all of those countries, but of course that wasn't always the case. Even if you haven't heard of Catchoua, you've most definitely heard of the Inca civilization whose capital was located at Cusco in present day Peru and who's empire was the largest in the Americas in the pre colonial period, and as their empire expanded the language spread to new areas because it became the general language or the Lingua Franca of the areas under the empire's control, the origin of catch, what is debated with some people saying that it originated in the Cusco area and others saying that it originated in the central coastal area of Peru.

Speaker 1:          01:14          Throughout the time of Inca rule. Catch well was not a written language. Records were only kept in kibbutz. A system of nodded strings that serve as symbols or mnemonic reminders of information keepers are not fully understood, but they are not thought to represent the sound or the structure of catch you up. Instead, they simply provide reminders of information to be passed down, orally catch what did not become a written language until the Spanish conquest of the Inca empire, which took place between 1532 and 15 slash 70 to catch what continued to be spoken as a Lingua Franca. After the Spanish conquest and the Catholic church used to catch why in its efforts to convert people spreading the language even further. The oldest written record of catch you up is a book written in 15, 60 by the missionary Domingo de Santo Tomas called Grammar or art of the general language of the Indians of the royalty of Peru.

Speaker 1:          02:06          After the Tupac Amaru rebellion of 1780, the colonial power band catch you up from public use even catch what texts that were pro colonial or pro Catholic were banned and the language began to decline after the Spanish American wars of independence from Eighteen, oh, eight to 18, 33 gets you ahead a brief revival, but it has gradually lost prestige and declined in use. One of the main reasons for the decline of catch you up is the use of Spanish as the language of education and of the media and the use of Spanish as the main language of national economies and with economic development comes increased urbanization. When people move from their local area to a major city, it's necessary to speak Spanish with the majority of people who don't speak catch you up. Spanish is often thought of as the language of prestige and of economic opportunity, so speakers of catch you up or people whose parents speak catch you up often see it as something low prestige and to avoid some ketchup speaking parents, avoid speaking, catch you up with their children at home and instead speak to them in Spanish.

Speaker 1:          03:06          Even in researching this video and then looking for volunteers to read the catch with samples, some people told me that they themselves don't speak, catch you up, but that their friend's parents speak Quechua or that their uncle or aunt's be Peru was the first country to make catch you on official language in 1975 along with Imr and other native languages in Bolivia. It's been an official language along with 35 other native languages since 2006 in Bolivia. Each regional government is officially bilingual, choosing both Spanish and one of the other official languages in Ecuador. Catch has had semi official status since 2009. Spanish is the main official language, but catch one shoe are referred to as official languages for intercultural relations even though catch what began to be written after the Spanish conquest is still mainly a spoken language and it isn't really written all that much and there are various different standards of orthography. This is partly because catch was spoken differently in different places.

Speaker 1:          04:07          Catch what is not really a single language. Rather it is a series of closely related groups of dialects and those groups have dialects that have a high level of mutual intelligibility, can be considered languages. If there were one standard written language that was widely accepted and widely used throughout all the different areas, then it might be able to be called a single language because of that unifying force, but there is no such standard language catch what is divided into two major dialect categories. Catch will one and catch what to which are fairly distinct from each other, but there's a dialect continuum within each category. Catch well. One is spoken in central Peru and to sometimes referred to as whitewash. Catch what too, which is sometimes called [inaudible] can be further subdivided into three dialect groups. There's [inaudible] in northern Peru. Catch what to be northern catch well also known as kitchen which has spoken mainly in Ecuador and southern Columbia and catch what to see southern catch you up, which includes the catch was spoken around Cusco in Bolivia and in Argentina.

Speaker 1:          05:09          Southern catch well is the most commonly spoken and the Cusco dialect is often seen as the de facto standard variety of catch. Well, even though it really isn't, the dialects within each of these groups are largely intelligible and there is some degree of intelligibility between the different groups. The lowest degree of intelligibility is between casual one and catch what to even if both varieties are located in Peru. The difference between a one and catch. What [inaudible] seems to have resulted from a split from catch will the main differences between them or in vocabulary and morphology. There are differences in pronunciation to, but there are also pronunciation differences within each group. So what is catch like? Let's look at some of the features of catch you up focusing on southern catch. Well, syntax catch while isn't Sov language subject, object, verb. Let's take a look at an example sentence.

Speaker 1:          06:02          This means Maria builds a house word for word. It's Maria House object marker, build, third person singular. You can see that the basic order is subject, object, verb. The subject comes at the beginning of the sentence when there's an explicit subject, but it's possible to have a complete sentence without the subject at the beginning, like lassie, todd, who won the end suffix at the end is a subject suffix, so it's often not necessary to have a subject at the beginning. Agglutination, one of catch was main features is that it's highly a gluten itself. Let's look at an example of a gluten nation using a noun.
