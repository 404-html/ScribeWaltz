Speaker 1:          00:00          Today I think I'll compare Portuguese with a special dialect of Portuguese called Spanish.

Speaker 1:          00:14          Hello everyone. Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and my name is Paul. Today's topic is how similar or Spanish and Portuguese, as you probably know, Spanish and Portuguese are both Ibero Romance languages that share a common origin. There are different enough that they are definitely considered different languages, but they're also closely related and quite similar in many ways. On paper, the two languages look very similar and speakers of either language can generally read the other language without too much trouble. The spoken language is however, are more different from each other and less mutually intelligible than the written forms and Portuguese speakers typically understand spoken Spanish better than Spanish speakers understand Portuguese because Portuguese speakers as smart. Well actually it's mostly because of the difference in pronunciation between the two languages, but we'll get into that a little later. Spanish and Portuguese share about 89 percent lexical similarity, meaning that 89 percent of the words have a cognate or an equivalent in the other language. Now, that doesn't always mean that 89 percent of the words will be the same because some of the different words are very basic and common words, and even though cognate words often look and sound quite similar, there are other cognates that have developed quite differently and now sound and look quite different. For instance, this pair of cognates clearly resemble each other in Spanish and in Portuguese.
