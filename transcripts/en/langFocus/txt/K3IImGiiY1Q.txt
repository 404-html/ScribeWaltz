Speaker 1:          00:01          Hi there.

Speaker 2:          00:02          Licensee, Deutsche, Deutsche. No, sorry, I don't speak Dutch.

Speaker 2:          00:09          Hello language, enthusiastic. Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and my name is Paul. Today I'm going to talk about the German language. German is a very important language that deserves all of our attention. It is spoken by $95 million native speakers mainly in central Europe, but it's also spoken by an additional 10 to $15 million second language speakers, especially in eastern Europe. It is the majority language and an official language in Germany of course, but also Austria, Switzerland, Liechtenstein and the south tyrol region of northern Italy. It's also an official language in Luxembourg and Belgium, but it's not a majority language there. German is the most widely spoken language in the European Union. It is also one of the most widely taught languages in the world with between 75 and 100 million people. Having studied it as a foreign language in both the United States and in Europe, it is the third most widely taught foreign language.

Speaker 2:          01:03          Did you know that one 10th of the world's books are published in German. German is also the second most widely used scientific language. I know some doctors and all of them have some reading knowledge of German because so much scientific research has documented in German, so are you starting to get an idea of why German is important? German is a member of the West Germanic language family, which also includes Dutch, Africans, Friesian, English and Yiddish. The West Germanic languages are part of the wider Germanic language family. So let's take a look at the origins of the dramatic language family. Wait, actually no, I did this in my last video, so I'm just going to play that part again while I go get a coffee and I'll be right back. All Germanic languages developed from Provo Germanic, which was spoken around 500 bce. Protoje dramatic possibly originated in Scandinavia, and different varieties of Germanic began to emerge with migration. Runic inscriptions from the second century ce show us that by that time, pro dramatic had began to separate into distinct western, eastern and northern dialects.

Speaker 1:          02:09          Oh, sorry. Are you guys waiting for me?

Speaker 2:          02:12          Well, let's move on. The West dramatic dialects were probably closely related enough to be mutually intelligible until about the eighth century ce, but at that time something was happening that would split their dramatic language family and give birth to the German language as we know it today. That was the hydromatic sounds shift or the hydromatic continental shift. Some west Germanic varieties underwent a number of sound changes, nine consonants changed to be precise and this created two distinct groups of Germanic dialect, high German or Deutsche and low German or plot doidge and just out of interest, let me pronounce these words a different way. High Deutsche and flat, which maybe there's a connection with English high German dialects arose in the southern areas of Germany which are at a higher elevation. That's why they're called hydrogen. The low German dialects existed in the northern part of Germany at a lower elevation and also in the Netherlands.

Speaker 2:          03:07          These terms do not refer to high end low status, but rather to the elevation of the areas they were spoken in, hydrogen can be further subdivided into two segments, upper German and central German. So what were the sound changes that took place? Well, let's take a look. These consonant changes took place in three stages. In the first stage, these consonants changed. Interval calendly, that means between vowel sounds, the p sound that became a foot, this to sound became a sub, and the sound became a cup. Here's an example for the English word. For Sleep. In Low German it's sloppy, but in German it's in the second stage. These continents changed at the beginning of a word and also in some other context, like if they are the second letter in a double consonant or after an l or an r sound book became per foot like a p and an f.

Speaker 2:          03:59          together the sound became a son. It sounds like a ts sound even though it's written with a z and the sound became a like a k sound followed by cup. Here's an example for the English word Tame. In lower German it's tem, but in high German it's, I'm in the third stage. Three more consonants changed. The book sound became a Po that the sound became a ta in the sound became a CCO. Here's an example for the English word for day in lower German, it's f, but in high German it's talk. Now all of these sound changes took place in upper German, in the south, but some of them didn't take place in central German and some of them didn't take place in standard German, but we'll get to standard German in a minute. So some of you might be thinking, well, how did these sounds just switch.

Speaker 2:          04:47          Well, they didn't instantly switch. They gradually changed over a period of a few centuries, probably between the fifth century and 18th century ce over the centuries, the dialect continuum of low German had high German grew more and more distinct until there were varieties that were quite incomprehensible, so someone from the south in Bavaria would have trouble communicating with someone from Hamburg in the north. But of course that was before standard German. The dialects of low German are often said to be a separate language from high German and there are often sent to be halfway between high German and Dutch. Now the low German dialect actually crosses the border into the eastern part of the Netherlands where low German has also spoken, but these days the low German dialects in the north of the country are mostly fading and basically only older people speak them. Younger people might understand them, but they tend to use standard German instead, but when did standard German come into the picture?

Speaker 2:          05:40          Standard German, which by the way is also called Hochdeutsch in German, so don't be confused between hydrogen and standard German, originated as a written literary language that developed over a few hundred years as writers tried to write in a way that would be understood by the largest number of people possible from different dialect areas, but perhaps the most important factor in the development of standard German was the translation of the Bible into German by Martin Luther in the year 15, 22. He based his translation on the sex in dialect of central German, while including some vocabulary from other dialects as well. Virtually all speakers of German dialects owned a copy of the new Bible and studied it effectively popularizing this form of written German. Originally there was no single way to pronounce this written form of German, but eventually the dialect of Hanover became the standard for pronunciation of standard German.

Speaker 2:          06:35          Standard German includes some of the sounds of the High German continental shift, but not all of them because it was influenced by the dialect of Hanover, so standard German began as a written language, but as it became the language of education, it became more widespread as the formal spoken language and it also influenced the local dialects. Today, pretty much everyone can speak standard German, even if they speak a local dialect casually and many local dialects have become largely replaced by standard German, especially the low German dialects in the north of the country, but there are still some dialects that are quite distinct and still thriving like the Bavarian dialect in the South East German is considered a plurry centric language. That means that there are multiple standard varieties of the language. There is one standard language in Germany, one in Australia and one in Switzerland. All of these standard varieties are pretty much the same except for some differing vocabulary, but of course those are the standard language of Switzerland and Austria and also south to roll, which is related to Austria, have their own dialects as well.

Speaker 2:          07:36          The Austrian dialects or related to the Bavarian dialects in South East Germany and the Swiss dialects are related to the element of dialects in southwest Germany. Maybe you saw my video about the languages of Switzerland. It's this one right here and in that video I talked about how the Swiss German dialects are kind of incomprehensible to speakers of standard German unless they also speak in dialect from the border area, but of course that's talking about the Swiss German dialects. Swiss Germans can speak standard German even if they tend to use it less than people in Germany. Of course they might pronounce standard German with a different accent, but that's no big deal in Austria and south to roll. The situation is similar. There are dialects that might be hard to understand for people from some other German speaking countries, but of course standard German is the bridge. These countries are all part of the German sprocket, Rome.

Speaker 2:          08:27          Wow. So which means the geographic area over which that language is spoken, and within that sprocket round standard German is the doc sprocket. That profit, that means the umbrella language under which all of those dialects can come together. Those two German terms I just used brock and are common linguistic terms and I think that shows just how much influence the German language has over academic areas of research like linguistics. So what is the German language like? Well, it's closely related to English, which is obvious when we look at the most basic sentences. Here's an example. I buy books often.

Speaker 3:          09:02          It's cold for whole fish booster. Each cow, Hoy who shot

Speaker 2:          09:08          hear the word order is Svo, like in English, except that the adverb comes before the object instead of after it. Here's another example with an important twist. I will buy the book today.

Speaker 3:          09:19          You've added a spool quite often each voucher, just calvin.

Speaker 2:          09:26          In this case, we see one of the most confusing things for learners of German, which is the placement of the second verb at the end of the sentence. So if there's a helping verb like will or voucher, it is in the normal Svo position, but the main verb goes at the end. Another example, the book was interesting

Speaker 3:          09:43          just via to the sun does va into the sand.

Speaker 2:          09:49          And one more example, I like people who work hard

Speaker 3:          09:53          ish. Mark mentioned to your hot button issue, mark mentioned the heart operation.

Speaker 2:          10:01          Another thing that learners have German find challenging is the case system in German, in German pronouns and nouns changed form depending on their function in the sentence, but along with them, the articles and adjectives also change. Here's an example of German grammatical cases using the now meaning table,

Speaker 3:          10:19          the acting dean, Trish just deem Tisha did. Tisha, Tisha, yeah, sure.

Speaker 2:          10:30          You can see that the change takes place not only in the noun but also in the definite article as well. The word for table is a masculine nouns in German, but there are actually three genders in German. There are masculine nouns, feminine nouns and Neuter Nouns, and for each of them, the case forms are different, and all of these different forms also apply to adjectives which drives learners crazy. So while German is closely related to English, the devil is in the details, even though most of the other Germanic languages are classified as category one. Languages by the Fsi, German is classified as category two, it's closely related to English and they have a lot in common in terms of the general syntax and vocabulary, but when it comes to the fine details of grammar, there are some challenges for learners, but as always, if you are interested in German speaking cultures and countries, or if you would like to benefit from the widespread use of German, then don't hesitate to start learning. All challenges become adventures when you become fascinated. The question of the day German speakers, do you think there's anything unique or special or interesting about your local variety of German and how do other varieties of German sound to you? Let us know in the comments down below and everyone else jump in and let's discuss. Thank you for watching and have a nice.
