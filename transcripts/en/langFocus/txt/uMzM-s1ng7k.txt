Speaker 1:          00:09          Hello everyone. Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and my name is Paul. Today we'll be answering the question how similar our Spanish and Italian, Spanish and Italian are both members of the romance language family, which developed from dialects of vulgar Latin, which were spoken throughout the Roman Empire. For more information on their history and development, check out my video on the romance language family right here, like any pair of romance languages. Spanish and Italian have a lot in common and they are mutually intelligible to some extent, especially in the written form and when spoken slowly and clearly some speakers of Spanish and Italian report that they are able to have extended conversations with speakers of the other language provided that they both speak slowly and clearly and they stopped to clarify unfamiliar vocabulary, but despite their similarity, Spanish and Italian are also different in many ways. Let's examine both of the languages together and we'll see just what's similar and different above them.

Speaker 1:          01:03          Vocabulary, Spanish and Italian have about 82 percent lexical similarity. That means that 82 percent of the words in either language will have cognate vocabulary in the other language. Let's look at some examples of Spanish and Italian cognates in Italian, Jada, dino, and in Spanish. How these means garden in Italian postal and in Spanish. Wisdom. This means place in Italian fjord and in Spanish, Florida. This means flower in Italian, bobby Lee, and in Spanish probably this means probable or likely in Italian and it's Spanish. What this means port, those pairs of words are quite obvious. Cognates. Let's look at a couple of less obvious cognates as well. In Italian feeding, you in Spanish, equal in Italian, he avi in Spanish or in Italian? Up ended Spanish. Gotcha. Now let's look at a couple of sentences to see how many of the words are similar. First in Spanish is still agenda and an Italian stone agenda on porn.

Speaker 1:          02:11          Liberal. This means I'm reading a good book, so when these two sentences, all of the vocabulary is equivalent or cognate. Another example in Spanish, and she took him yet in Italian ob zone, you'll notice all these sentences mean I need to change a little money. The way to express need is different than the two sentences in Spanish, yet necessito and in Italian it's ob zone. Your d in Spanish, the way to say a little is wouldn't buckle. In Italian, it's wouldn't pull. In Italian, you can also say wouldn't buckle, which is correct, but it's more common to say, wouldn't pull next the preposition like have his day in Spanish and it's deep. In Italian, the word for money is in Spanish and it's solid in Italian. So in this case you can see that some of the vocabulary is the same or equivalent, but not all of it.

Speaker 1:          03:02          And one more example in Spanish and in Italian Dayville Trovata. When a banker, these sentences mean I need to find a bank. In these sentences we see need expressed in different ways than in the last pair of sentences. In Spanish it's tango, k, in Italian it's devil, but in Spanish it's also possible to say table and obvious cognitive devil. The word meaning to find is also different. In Spanish it's English, but in Italian it's Audi. Actually the Spanish word can also mean to meet and there's a different Italian word, England throughout it, which is a cognitive angle, but it only means to meet, not to find. Next you can see that the words for bank are cognates, but interestingly they have different gender. In Spanish, it's masculine, which we can see from the article soon and the Oh, at the end of uncle and an Italian. It's feminine, which we can see from the article Una and the a at the end of bunker.

Speaker 1:          03:55          So from these examples we can see that there's a lot of crossover between Spanish vocabulary and Italian vocabulary, but there are also some false friends to watch out for false friends. No, I don't mean to face to people who talk behind your back. I mean words that look and sound similar and either language and likely share a common origin, but they have a different meaning or usage in each language. For example, in Spanish, but on the door mean soon in Italian, put on top means ready in Spanish. Whether that means to keep or to guard in Italian Guata dot, it means to look at in Spanish means office. In Italian, Oficina means workshop. There's a different word in Italian you, which means office in Spanish means pregnant, but in Italian means embarrassed. False friends like these are a common source of confusion for people who learn a language that's similar to one.

Speaker 1:          04:50          They already know. If we only look at lexical similarity, Spanish has more in common with Portuguese than it does with the Italian and the Italian has more in common with French than it does with Spanish. In either case, it's 89 percent lexical similarity, but Spanish and Italian are more similar and pronunciation than those other pairs of languages which can sometimes lead to more intelligibility. Pronunciation Spanish has five. Vowel sounds, a e, a. Oh, Italian also has these five vowels. Sounds plus two additional ones. Italian has to east sounds open. He at like the in bed and closed. He a like the vowel sound in say it also has to. Oh, sounds open. Oh, off like the Oh and pop and the closed. Oh, sound. Oh, like the. Oh, and pope and both Spanish and Italian have a similar role. Take our sound. One notable difference between Spanish and Italian pronunciation is that almost all Italian words end in a vowel, but in Spanish, this is not the case.

Speaker 1:          05:49          For example, in Italian custody, which means to cost, but in Spanish it's goes to the Italian word, ends in a vowel while the Spanish word ends in a continent. If you watch out for this, you'll notice it quite a lot. Pronunciation and orthography in both Spanish and Italian, C and g become soft when followed by I or II, but the soft sound is different in each language. In Spanish, the soft see sounds like thug or sung. In Italian, it sounds like in Spanish, the soft g sounds like in Italian it sounds like Joe, for example, in Spanish and in Italian to Ta, this means city in Spanish and it means people, but in Italian it's Gente in Spanish, and it either means general. In Italian it's Gen ed Ali. Some words like those above are cognates. That sound different. There are other words that sound similar but have to be written differently to reflect their sound.

Speaker 1:          06:50          The word for what in Spanish is k spelled with q and an Italian. It's k spelled with a c, H in Spanish. If you want to have the hard c sound before I or II, you have to spell it as q. You in Italian, you have to spell it as c, h and while c h always represents a hard c sound and Italian and Spanish at represents the sound like an English, so in Italian you have joke gelatto spelled with cei at the beginning, but in Spanish you have that day spelled with C, h in Spanish you have wonder meaning when and Glenda, meaning how much, and in Italian you have quandl and quantile. In Spanish you can't write it with q you because that always represents a hard c sound, so the words would end up sounding like a and comfortable. Some of the differences in pronunciation and orthography between Spanish and Italian are fairly systematic.

Speaker 1:          07:40          For example, he in Italian often becomes, I eat in Spanish for example. Temple becomes the MPO. Then day becomes the ending and went an Italian. You Have Sc, SF or sp or st at the beginning of a word in Spanish. These are often proceeded by an IEP. For example, [inaudible] in Italian becomes as could to be in Spanish and especially in Italian becomes a speciality in Spanish. One other thing to note is that double consonants are very common in Italian, but in Spanish most consonants can't be doubled. For example, in Italian got Dole means cat, but in Spanish it's that the end in Italian means cup, but it's in Spanish grammar. The general word order of Spanish and Italian is very similar. Have a look at these two sentences in Spanish and in Italian, Louis, no money, no money. You can see that there's some different vocabulary, but the sentences are translatable.

Speaker 1:          08:43          Word for word. Notice that in both languages, the subject Pronoun is normally optional because the verb is conjugated for person and number. Another example in Spanish or in Italian? Well, your scrotum. This means I wrote him a letter, so here hear the word order is still exactly the same, and notice that the object Pronoun comes before the conjugated verb. In this case, the auxiliary verbs in both languages. Italian grammar has a couple of complications. That Spanish doesn't have. Articles, articles in Italian or more complicated than it. Spanish in Spanish. The indefinite articles, our own for masculine nouns and owner for feminine nouns. Also in Italian, it's Oona Una, but boone becomes uno before words beginning and s or z, followed by another continent and Una becomes an apostrophe before unowned, beginning with a vowel, so in Italian we have past, but we student debt and we have key ave, but when Italiana, Spanish and Italian, both have four basic definite articles in Spanish.

Speaker 1:          09:46          They are for masculine singular law, for feminine, singular, for masculine, plural, less feminine, plural. In Italian, the ill for masculine, singular law for feminine, singular for masculine, plural, and lay for feminine plural, but it'll becomes low before words beginning with Srz plus another continent and it becomes l apostrophe before a vowel and eat becomes leaky before s or z plus another continent, so we have it'll pass support at all, but law students which are both masculine singular and we have ipass it, but the identity which are both masculine plural, also both law and lay become l apostrophe before vowel possessive pronouns. The way possessive pronouns are used is also a little bit different. In Italian, possessive pronouns are normally used together with a definite article except when we talk about family members, but in Spanish the definite article is not required. So in Italian you have Lamina beachy collector and it's Spanish.

Speaker 1:          10:49          You have music later, so notice in Spanish there's no definite article law. Another difference to notice here is that in Spanish there is no distinction between masculine and feminine possessive pronouns. In Italian there's mia for feminine singular and meal for masculine singular, but in Spanish there's just me for both verbs. The verb tense is used and the way that verbs are conjugated is really quite similar in both languages. Of course, the exact conjugations are not quite the same, but they are fairly similar. Here's a sentence, meaning they will live in New York. The verb to live in Italian is vivacity and in Spanish it's Bev is the sentence in Italian lovato and New York. In Spanish, they just maybe then we can see that the third person, plural, future tense conjugation is similar, but notice that the Italian one ends in a double consonant and vowel. Now let's look at a sentence in the past, in the present, perfect.

Speaker 1:          11:42          To be precise, this sentence means she bought too many things in Italian layout and it's Spanish. Yet the present perfect tense is formed the same way in both languages. First, here is the auxiliary verb, meaning to have have edit in Italian or in Spanish. That's followed by the past participle of the verb, meaning to buy [inaudible] in Italian and in Spanish. One thing to note about the present perfect tense is that an Italian, most verbs take the auxiliary verb, Aveda to have, but some verbs take std meaning to be as their auxiliary verb. That's similar to in French, but in Spanish the only auxiliary verb is I've added meaning to have, so in Italian there's a in Toronto, meaning he entered, but in Spanish it's I am data. Those are just a couple of examples, but basically all verb tenses and all verb forms have an equivalent or a parallel in the other language bringing it altogether.

Speaker 1:          12:41          Let's just look at a couple more sentences and see what we find along the way. This sentence means Maria is less intelligent than her sister in Spanish as is of manner and an Italian mother. Men though he did the suicide ella. Here we can see that the word order is the same and we can basically translate the sentence is word for word. The third person, female form of the verb to be is similar but slightly different. The word for less is similar but slightly different. The word for intelligent is similar, but in Spanish the g sound is softened to a cup while an Italian, it's softened to a job and the Italian word has a doubled l. The preposition used is also different. The possessive Pronoun is similar, but in Spanish there is no gender distinction and the word for sister is different in the two languages, as you can see, Spanish, Italian have a lot of similarities including basically the same word, order, similar grammar, a lot of similar vocabulary and generally speaking, similar pronunciation, but there are still significant differences, particularly in vocabulary, pronunciation and slash or photography.

Speaker 1:          13:46          They are different enough that they are unmistakably two different languages, but they're similar enough that there is a certain degree of mutual intelligibility and that degree of mutual intelligibility can probably be greatly increased by studying even the basics of the other language, but producing the other language accurately is obviously another matter and that would require dedicated study. Okay. The question of the day for native speakers of Spanish and Italian, how well can you understand the other language both in speech and in writing and have you ever tried to converse with a speaker of the other language using only your native languages? How did that work out and for learners of Spanish and Italian? How much does your knowledge of one of those languages help you make sense of the other? Let us know in the comments down below. Be sure to follow Lang, focus on facebook, twitter, and Instagram, and as always I would like to say thank you to all of my patrion supporters, especially these ones right here on the screen for their monthly pledges. Thank you for watching and have a nice.
