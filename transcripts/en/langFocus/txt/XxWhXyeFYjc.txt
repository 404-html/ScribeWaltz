Speaker 1:          00:00          Wake the fuck up the Americans. I'm here to talk some sense into you. Well, hold on a second. I'm Canadian and when I say Americans, I'm including Canadians in that because Canadians admitted we're really just the 51st state. We're like California with Igloos. So Canadians, Americans, same thing anywhere. What was I saying? We've got the Americans. I'm here to talk some sense into you as a nation. We suck with languages. 43% of all people around the world are bilingual. That includes over 50% of the people in Europe and in some countries like Indonesia and Philippines, virtually everybody is bilingual and it's very common in a lot of countries for people to speak three, four, or even five languages on a regular basis. But in America, only 20% of the people are bilingual. And guess what? Almost all of those people are immigrants or the children of immigrants amongst homegrown Americans, very few are bilingual. And in the northern province of Canada at the situation is not much different. Most of the people who are bilingual are immigrants or Francophone Canadians, French speaking, Canadians, anglophone. Canadians are generally modeling. You will, very few of them are bilingual. In Australia, the numbers are even worse. And in Europe, guests which countries have the lowest levels of bilingualism?

Speaker 1:          01:21          So at the point I'm making is that angler phones basically do not become bilingual. I don't want to say that anglophones are lazy, but why the hell are we so damn lazy? Well, obviously it's because of a lack of incentive. English is the international language. So why should I put in all this time and effort to speak another language when other people will just speak English with me? Isn't it Kinda sorta arrogant to expect all the other people to put in all the effort to accommodate us? Anybody who has traveled has probably seen Americans or other anglophones getting frustrated with the locals when they couldn't speak English. But if those anglophones had ever learned a second language for themselves, maybe they would be able to understand and empathize with that other person and find a way to communicate with them. The truth is English is not spoken by most people in the world despite the fact that it's the de facto international language.

Speaker 1:          02:14          Most people simply don't speak English unless you stick to the men tourist traps and who likes cheesy tourist traps. Knowing another major language can greatly help you communicate around the world. If there's also no guarantee that English will be the international language for much longer. Not too long ago, the international language was French, and in the future, maybe it will be Chinese or Spanish. Who knows? Well, it probably won't be Chinese, but you never know. The number of Spanish speakers is growing rapidly, and a lot of Spanish speaking countries are in the process of developing rapidly. So Spanish could become much more important than the near future. But even if.
