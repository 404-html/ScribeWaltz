Speaker 1:          00:00          How similar are Japanese and Korean? The. Hold on. Okay. Now we can start. Hello everyone. Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and my name is Paul. How similar our Japanese and Korean. That is the question of the day. Japan and Korea are geographically very close to each other and at first glance they look like similar countries with similar cultures in a way, but just how similar are the Japanese and Korean languages? Well, the short answer is they are closer to each other than they are to any other languages and they are remarkably similar in some ways, but in other ways they're also very different and they are certainly not mutually intelligible. Disclaimer, I don't speak very much Korean, but I do speak Japanese and I am aware of the differences and similarities between them. Let's look at the similarities in terms of grammar, vocabulary, pronunciation, and the writing systems.

Speaker 1:          00:59          When it comes to syntax and grammar, Japanese and Korean are very similar. Japanese and Korean sentences can often be translated word by word with each word in one sentence, having an equivalent in the other. Let's look at a couple of Korean and Japanese sentences side by side, and we can see the similarities. Again, I don't really speak much Korean, so with my pronunciation is terrible. Koreans, please forgive me in English, I am a student in Korean. None. Then huck saying either in Japanese, what Tashi duck say this. You can see that these sentences are translatable word by word that each word in the first sentence has an equivalent in the second sentence in the exact same position, so if they are directly translatable. One thing I want to point out is the topic marker. That's the second word. In each of these sentences, that topic, Margaret, is something that's kind of unique to Japanese and Korean topic.

Speaker 1:          01:50          Marker points out the topics of a sentence that's different from the grammatical subject, the overarching focus or topic of the sentence. Another thing I want to point out is the last word. In each sentence. In Korean it's EDA and in Japanese it's destitute. In both cases that's like a popular, like the word is in English, so in both Japanese and Korean. This is a standalone word that is placed usually at the end of the sentence in Korean and undone in Japanese. What does you up and easily will know me much, so again, we see that the topics marker is the second word in each sentence, but a more important thing that I want to point out here is the Sov word order. That means subject, object, verb, so we can see that the subject is what? Touchy or it's not in Korean, and then we have the object next to the object is water.

Speaker 1:          02:41          In Korean it's and in Japanese it's music and then we have the verb at the end. So in Korean law seemed that Indian Japanese nomi must, but before the verb there is an interesting little word that we don't have an English and that is an object marker. So that's another thing that we find in both Japanese and Korean used in exactly the same way in exactly the same position in the census, even though the grammar and sentence structure of the two languages is remarkably similar, the vocabulary is remarkably different. If a Japanese speaker heard Korean without any prior exposure, they probably wouldn't understand any of the words at all or maybe just a word here and there, but that doesn't mean that those words aren't related. Korean and Japanese both inherited a large number of loan words from Chinese. Approximately 60 percent of the vocabulary in either language comes from Chinese.

Speaker 1:          03:33          If there are so many Chinese loan words in both languages, then why are they not mutually comprehensible? Well, it's important to note that for both languages in daily conversation and informal speech, that Chinese loan words are not used nearly as much as they are in writing. Also, the Chinese loan words are different in either language to enter the languages in the form of Chinese characters, but the pronunciation of those characters became adapted to fit the phonological system of either language. So let's look at some examples. The first example is just the name of those Chinese characters themselves. In Chinese, in Korean, I'm job in Japanese Kanji so you can see that the pronunciation started as an answer, but it diverged and became different in Korean and Japanese even though it's the same two characters at some other examples in Korean sap team in Japanese, Shashi and photograph the were forcing her in Korean.

Speaker 1:          04:30          In Japanese costumes. The word for promise in Korean. Yuck. Sold in Japanese. Yeah, because so cute. Those examples sound quite similar, but sometimes they sound really quite different, but if we look at the romanized world, sometimes we can see the similarities. This is the word for telephone in Korean children. Wow. In Japanese then? Well, so those come from the same characters, but again, they're rendered differently in pronunciation. The next word is school in Korean. How you'll in Japanese got cold. Another example is university in Korean, in Japanese got Tofu in Korean to boot in Japanese soul food. The word for SPA or hot spring in Korean. On John, in Japanese on sand. So you can see that sometimes the words are clearly related, but when you're listening to the language being spoken, you probably wouldn't be able to catch those words. Chinese loan words aside.

Speaker 1:          05:28          There are also some Japanese loan words that have entered the Korean language. The word for cheers when you're having a drink and Korean going pay in Japanese come by. The Japanese word for bag in Korean it's in Japanese. It's come on. There are also a lot of words that are native to both Korean and Japanese that might be related to each other. The word for island in Korean, in Japanese Shima the word for village in Korean. In Japanese, Buddha. There are a lot of words like that that I don't really think are connected, but linguists think might be connected. Interestingly though, some of the grammatical particles have very similar pronunciations in the two languages. For example, the word for above. In Korean we ate in Japanese who a question particle co in Korean, the double continent, the Double Cup in. In Japanese it's cut the word for two or towards.

Speaker 1:          06:22          In Korean it's a and in Japanese it's a the subject marker, so this is different from the topic. Margaret, the subject marker is in Korean, got for eat in Japanese, it's just got so basically Korean and Japanese have a lot of vocabulary that are related but not the same. It's probably enough to help you remember that word if you study it, but not necessarily enough to pick up that word when you're hearing it in conversation, and of course most of the spoken vocabulary seems to be unrelated or they're words that have very ancient connections to each other. Now let's look at the different pronunciation of the two languages. In some ways they're similar. The basic phonetic sounds of the two languages are quite similar, but the way those phonetic sounds are arranged to create syllables is different in the two languages. In Japanese, basically every syllable has to end in a vowel.

Speaker 1:          07:12          You cannot have a word that ends in a solid consonant like cut. It has to be something like customer with a vowel added to the end, but in Korean you can have a consonant at the end of a syllable. That's why in one of the words that we compared before the word promise, in Japanese, it's yet grew so poor. You need those vowels after the continence, but in Korea, and it's yet another difference is that in Japanese, the pronunciation of consonants doesn't change depending on their position in the word, they just are always the same, but in Korean there are consonants and that can change depending on whether they're at the beginning of the word in the middle of the word or at the end of the word. Korean also has a greater variety of vowels and diphthongs, so in general, Korean pronunciation is just more complex than Japanese pronunciation. One thing that is completely different between the two languages is there writing systems.

Speaker 1:          08:02          Japanese is written using a combination of Chinese characters and two syllables. Those is consist of characters that represent entire syllables rather than just individual phonetic sounds. The Japanese writing system is quite complex and since you need to learn more than 2000 congee to be able to read at an adult level, it can take quite a lot of time and effort to learn. Korean, on the other hand, is written in the humble alphabet, which is one of the simplest writing systems in the world. Korean used to use Han Chinese characters in the same way that Japanese uses congee and combination with Ido gonna Kinda Kinda. But they've done away with that and now they're just using the simplified writing system of humble, humble. Alphabet consists of individual phonetic symbols that are arranged together to create syllables. In this example for hunch, this is the sound for like an h.

Speaker 1:          08:51          This is the sound. This is the sound for like an end. This is the sound for a job for sure. And this is ah, so whereas Japanese requires you to learn 92 syllabary symbols and 2000 congee in Korea and you just have to learn 24 phonetic symbols and you can use those to represent any new words that you learned. So to summarize, Korean and Japanese are very similar in terms of sentence structure and grammar and they both have a large number of Chinese loan words, but the native vocabularies are quite different as is the pronunciation which makes these two languages mutually unintelligible. On top of that, the two writing systems are now completely different with the new modern Korean system, completely avoiding Chinese characters these days. My feeling is that Japanese and Korean did originate from the same language a very long time ago, but they've been diverging for a long time, perhaps about 2000 years so that now they're very different even though structurally they're quite similar.
