Speaker 1:          00:06          Hello everyone. Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and my name is Paul. Today's topic is the Japanese language or as it's called in Japanese. Japanese has around 126 million native speakers making it the ninth most spoken language in the world. If we focus on native speakers alone, it's spoken mainly in the Northeast Asian nation of Japan and also to a limited extent in some immigrant communities and amongst some elderly people living in Japan's former colonies like Korea and Taiwan. Japanese belongs to the Japonica language family, which also includes the endangered Yuku on languages of Okinawa and the Emami islands, but the early history of Japanese and its relationship to other languages is largely unknown. There are theories that the Japanese and Korean languages share a common ancestor and there are theories that Japanese and Korean are part of a wider language family called the [inaudible] language family, which also includes the Turkic languages, Mongolian and the tongue gooseneck languages, but the alltech language family and the connection between Japanese and Korean are theoretic there hotly debated and are not generally accepted.

Speaker 1:          01:15          There are also theories that Japanese are rose from contact between the language of the aoe people who migrated from the North East Asia and mainland into Japan two to 3000 years ago and the language or languages of the Jomon people who were already living there. But the nature of the languages that these two groups of people spoke is not clearly known. Japanese was not a written language in its early history during the [inaudible] period, which leaves us very little evidence of what it was actually like during that time in the third century ce, the Yamato States in Japan established relations with China and the next 600 years would be a period of heavy Chinese influence during which the rulers and the elite sought to emulate many aspects of Chinese culture. Written Chinese was probably introduced to Japan in the fourth century and since Japanese had no written form, classical Chinese became the first literary language used by the elite.

Speaker 1:          02:08          Later Chinese characters began being adapted to write Japanese. The earliest examples we have of Japanese writing are from the eighth century and there are two forms, cumbersome and manual. Ghana come Boone's. What's the writing of Japanese in classical Chinese style using Chinese characters to represent the meaning of Japanese words. These texts were essentially Chinese, but were intended to be readable in Japanese. Manual in Ghana was a way of writing Japanese entirely in Chinese characters with most of the characters representing the phonetic sound of the underlying Japanese syllables. For example, the Japanese word for Mountain Yama was written using these two Chinese characters for their phonetic value rather than using the Chinese character, which means mountain, which is the character used today and not one Chinese character was used for each sound. Numerous different characters could be used to represent the same sound. For example, the syllable car.

Speaker 1:          03:07          It could be represented by any of the following characters, writing Japanese characters phonetically using Chinese characters that had no connection to the meaning must have felt like a lot of unnecessary hard work. So two systems of simplified phonetic characters developed from the manual Ghana System in the eighth and ninth centuries. In order to simplify the writing process. These two systems where she had a gunner and Katakana, one of the main uses of these new kinds of systems was to annotate, to combine texts so that Japanese speakers could read these classical Chinese or Chinese style texts as though they were Japanese. Chinese characters represented the meaning of the content words while come up provided the pronunciation as well as the grammatical elements and inflections that were not present in Chinese. Some diacritic markers also indicated how to change the word order when reading the text in Japanese.

Speaker 1:          03:58          This method of annotating Chinese texts with Kona was the precursor to the modern Japanese writing system. Through this process of trying to make the written Chinese language fit with the spoken Japanese language, a huge amount of Chinese vocabulary entered Japanese Chinese characters where sometimes annotated to be pronounced with their Chinese pronunciation known as on your me and sometimes pronounced as a native Japanese word with a similar meaning. These pronunciations are known as who Naomi. Such Chinese words have become an integral part of Japanese comprising 60% of the total vocabulary, particularly in writing. During the late middle Japanese period from the year 1185 to 16 hundreds Japanese continued to develop and move to closer towards modern Japanese pharmacologically. In particular towards the end of this time period in the year 1543 the first Europeans visited Japan and some European vocabulary entered Japanese through contact with traders and missionaries.

Speaker 1:          04:56          This contact mostly came to a halt during the period of national isolation from 1603 to 1853 during this time, contact with foreigners was strictly limited to a couple of specific places like the Dutch trading post dead Jima in Nagasaki. A significant number of Dutch loan words did enter Japanese during this time period. Some of them common everyday words like from clueless, from lump, from coffee, from cope. These words are examples of lone words aside from Chinese borrowings and compounds. Normally loan words from European languages, which are normally written in Katakana. This period of isolation took place during the Ed Oh period during which the Capitol moved from conside to adal. Present Day Tokyo and the Ed or dialect became the standard variety of Japanese after this period of isolation ended in 1853 interaction with the.
