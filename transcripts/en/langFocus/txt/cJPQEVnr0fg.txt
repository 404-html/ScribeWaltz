Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello everyone, welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and my name is Paul. Today's topic is the Korean language or hungle name as it's called in Korean and actually in North Korea. It's called Tucson. My Korean is one of the major languages of Northeast Asia. It's spoken as a first language by a total of around 80 million people, including around $50 million in South Korea, $25 million in North Korea and around two point 5 million in China, including the Yom [inaudible] and Chung back Korean autonomous areas, which are both in Gelian province near the border with North Korea. It's also spoken by minorities in Japan, Russia, and numerous other countries throughout the world. The roots of the Korean language are unclear and are the subject of much debate. Some think it's a member of the altruistic language family alongside Turkic Mongolian and 10 gooseneck and Japonica languages, but these days the alltech language family is no longer widely accepted or shall we say it's unproven.

Speaker 1:          00:58          Others think that Korean shares ancient roots with the dravidian languages of southern India and Sri Lanka, and there's another theory that Korean derives from the Austronesian language family, but there's no definitive proof for any of these theories, so Korean is often defined as a language isolate. The sole member of the chorionic language family. The lack of evidence for any of these theories is largely because of the lack of samples of older Korean writing. The oldest samples that we are aware of are less than a thousand years old and the written in Chinese characters making them hard to decipher old Korean. The first century ce marks the beginning of the three kingdoms period on the Korean Peninsula and Manchuria the kingdoms were picked. J and Sheila. It's not known for sure just how closely the languages of these kingdoms were related. They may have all been closely related dialects of old Korean or they may have been distinct members of the chorionic language family from limited information, mainly place names.

Speaker 1:          01:56          It appears that the languages were similar but not exactly the same. There may have been two groups have chorionic languages with a group including Pouliot, Co gooyow and pull your Pec Jay and the hunting group, which included Shinola in South Korea. It's widely believed that Shinola is the direct ancestor of modern Korean in North Korea. It's widely believed that go google is the direct ancestor of modern Korean. During the Unified Sheila period, beginning in the seventh century, when Sheila conquered the other kingdoms, the Shilla variety became the dominant language of the peninsula. This is the form of old Korean that became the ancestor of Middle Korean. Korea has been tremendously influenced by China throughout its history due to invasion attempts, alliances, and extensive trade. The influence on Korean culture includes stunning influence on the Korean language. Since Korean didn't have its own writing system, it adopted the Chinese writing system and used it well into the era of Middle Korean and a huge amount of Chinese vocabulary entered Korean through the literary language, Middle Korean.

Speaker 1:          03:03          When the Korea Dynasty began in the 10th century, the capital moved to case on, so the case on dialect became the prestige language. It seems that by this time the peninsula basically spoke the same language, so this was simply a dialectal change. The first written record of Korean that we know of beyond place names comes from this time period, the sources Chinese and gives a few hundred examples of Korean words written phonetically using Chinese characters. One feature of Middle Korean is that it featured for tones and on top of that Chinese loan words still retained their tones as well. These tone distinctions have disappeared in modern standard Korean, but there are a couple of dialects that do retain some of these distinctions. We know that Middle Korean had tones because there were markings indicating tone in the hungle writing system, which was created in 1444 by king say Joan, the great of the Chosun Dynasty humble was created to increase literacy among the poor and people without a formal education.

Speaker 1:          04:00          Prior to the creation of hungle Korean went through a number of different writing systems that use Chinese characters in various ways to represent Korean. None of which were an ideal match for Korean or very easy to learn in the beginning. Elites and scholars opposed the introduction of hungle, but over the following centuries it became widespread and humble is such an ingenious writing system that it's really hard to imagine how it wouldn't have become widespread for a long time. Korean was often written and published in a mixed script using hunch on Chinese characters for content, words and hungle for functional or grammatical words and inflections. It was quite similar to how Japanese is still written today. Speaking of Japanese, Korea was occupied by Japan from 1910 until 1945. During the occupation, Japanese was made. The official language and policies were implemented that would have replaced Korean with Japanese if the occupation had not been ended.

Speaker 1:          04:55          Japanese was made the language of education except for Korean class and speaking Korean at school was band. Koreans were pressured to replace their Korean names with Japanese names and Korean language. Newspapers were ordered to shut down. These assimilationist policies were gradually introduced and speed it up in the later years of the occupation. Thankfully, the Korean language survived to the occupation, but a significant amount of Japanese vocabulary. It was absorbed into the language in the decades since the occupation ended. Hungyo have gradually become deemphasized in favor of hungle. Nowadays, most texts are written entirely or mostly in hungle with hunch up, mainly used to prevent possible ambiguity between homophones and in North Korea. Specifically hunch shot were eliminated from all official publications in 1949. I'm going to speculate that the growing emphasis on hungle was partly a reaction to the Japanese occupation, that a growing sense of Korean sovereignty made the Korean people want to use more of their nations homegrown script.

Speaker 1:          05:54          The existence of the hungle script is now every year on hungle day, October ninth in South Korea and on chosen Google Day, January 15th in North Korea. Both Koreas have a literacy rate of over 99 percent. So I guess there is reason to celebrate. So what's Korean like? Well, there's a lot to say about Korean and there's no way I can give a complete comprehensive overview of the whole language in a single video, but we'll look at some of it's important features. Hungle hungle is a fantastic writing system that you can learn to read very quickly. There is a basic set of consonant and vowel symbols that are arranged together to form compact syllables. This says hungle this symbolist, Huh? This is, this is, this is, this is, and this is, oh, this system is ingenious. Because once you get used to the most common combinations of symbols, then you can instantly recognize them.

Speaker 1:          06:49          The consonant symbols fall into groups of different letters. These continents are vilar, and the basic shape shows the tongues position in the mouth. This point indicates the place of articulation near the back of the mouth. These consonants are alveolar and the basic shape shows the tongue touching the roof of the mouth. These consonants are bilabial and the basic shape shows a mouth with two lips. These consonants are dentals, and the basic shape shows the place of articulation at the upper teeth. These consonants are glottal, and the basic shape shows that the place of articulation is in your throat. Vocabulary. In most current examples of written Korean, all or almost all of the words are written in Hungle, including native Korean words. And Sign, oh, Korean words, words of Chinese origin, believe it or not, sign. Oh, Korean words account for over 60 percent of Korean vocabulary.

Speaker 1:          07:39          There are most prevalent in formal and academic vocabulary, but they're very common in everyday speech as well. Let's look at the Chinese vocabulary that appears in the following sentences. This sentence means, do you like your teacher? Some of the same names were. He'll notice the word sunsetting, which means teacher. This word is of Chinese origin. This sentence means what's your phone number? So novel and allowable. All the words for telephone and number are of Chinese origin. When Korean is written in a mixed hungle hunt, just script. You can more easily identify it, the Sino Korean words, and you can more easily distinguish between words that sound the same because they are written with different Chinese characters, but these days they are mainly written in hungle. Korean also contains more recent loan words from other languages, mainly English words like choose soup, meaning juice, poor meaning fork, send, do, eat, see meaning, sandwich.

Speaker 1:          08:33          Obviously the pronunciation of these words has naturally changed and become suited to Korean phonology. Some loan words are abbreviated or used in ways that the original words were not used. For example, the word said con means Selfie, which came from the words self and camera. Another example I usually ping means window shopping and comes from the words I and shopping sentence structure. Korean is a verb, final language with the verb. At the end of the sentence, a typical sentence is Sov. This sentence means I play baseball. None in Yagoona Hale. Here's the subject. Now here's the object. Yeah, Gu, and here's the verb. Hail. It's also possible to say the sentence with no subject if it's clear from the context, but let's go back to the original sentence for a minute. In addition to the subject, object and verb, there are two other words in the sentence. These words are particles.

Speaker 1:          09:27          Words that are placed after nouns to indicate their function or relationship to other words in the sentence. Little is a direct object marker showing that, yeah, Gu baseball is the object of the verb. A little is the form that follows a word ending in a vowel. Oh, is the form that follows words ending in a consonant, noon is a topic marker. The form that comes afterwards ending in a consonant is earned, not is the subject of the sentence, but it's also the topic that means now is information that has previously been mentioned or as clear from the context and that it's the topic being elaborated on. There are also subject markers. He after a consonant and Qa after a vowel subject, markers are used to introduce new information or to introduce the importance of existing information. In other words, to emphasize it, we could change the sentence above to make not the subject. Degas, yeah, I alluded hail, notice that not is pronounced as nay when followed by ca and the pronunciation of changes to God. In this sentence, Degas shows that I is the new information or emphasized information. This might be said in response to a question asking who plays baseball in English. We might stress this subject like I play baseball. Here's another example of when you might use the subject marker.

Speaker 1:          10:49          This sentence means my mother entered the room. Actually, this part literally means our mother, but it's used to mean my when referring to your own ingroup. Anyway, in this case, my mother is new information because before that she wasn't present, she wasn't in the room, so the subject particle is suitable. Here, this word here a is another particle showing direction, like the English preposition to or into, but technically speaking, since the particle comes after the Noun, it's a post position rather than a preposition. In Korean modifiers come before the things that they modify. That means that adjectives come before nouns. Dual pins on this means a tall mountain. This is the word for tall and this is the word for mountain. This part connects the adjective to the gnome. Longer modifiers also come before the noun. You want them to modify it. This phrase means the mountain.

Speaker 1:          11:42          I want to climb. Degas, older bullshit. Pleasanton, word for word. This phrase is I subject marker. Climb, want connector mountain. But if we take the whole modifying clause, a single unit, this modifier plus Noun pattern is like saying the, I want to climb the mountain. So whereas in English, the modifier would come after the nouns. In Korean, it comes before. By the way, this sentence could mean a mountain. I want to climb with indefinite meaning. Korean doesn't have definite or indefinite articles. So definiteness can be understood from context verbs and adjectives. Every sentence in Korean must end in either a verb or an adjective, and verbs and adjectives act very similar to each other in Korean, with both being conjugated, for pastor, non past and for different politeness levels. First, let's look at verbs. The dictionary form of verbs all end in de, for example, this verb meaning to stop and this verb meaning to sleep.

Speaker 1:          12:40          In order to conjugate these verbs, you remove and you are left with the verb stem which you add affixes to. So let's conjugate these verbs in the present tense or non past tense. To be precise. This sentence means he stops eating coonamble d'amato. So look at how we conjugate the verb to stop the stem is model. The informal, present tense ending is ah, and the polite suffix is your. So this is the informal, polite conjugation for verb stems, whose final vowel sound is awful, or Oh, this verb ends in a consonant, but when the verb ends in a vowel, then only you'll is added. For example, Coonan's Hale, he sleeps notes that with either of these verbs you could remove your to make an informal non polite sentence. In other words, a more casual sentence. If the stem ends in it's replaced with audio. Here's an example with the verb meaning to try and sit down.

Speaker 1:          13:38          Could do it. In this sentence means they try. If the last vegetable of the stem is all or eat or a combined vowel, then or are y'all, is added to the stem. Look down again, we have the verb meaning to eat. Non In this sentence means I eat pogie. Let's take a look at how the past tense is formed by changing some of those sentences into the past. Before we had this sentence, Cunanan look on io, meaning he stops eating. Let's change this to. He stopped eating in the past Coonan sale. He Sleeps Coonan tail, he slept coconut soil. Let's remove the polite suffix, your for a moment. Notice that the past tense form equals the present tense form with this affix saw attached then to make it polite, we can add your future tense. Korean technically doesn't have a future tense, only passed and non passed, but there are ways to express the future, the most common being, the probable future for them.

Speaker 1:          14:43          To use the probable future form, you add a little cardio to the verb stem. None in this sentence means I'm going to eat Takagi. When talking about things aside from yourself, the probable future refers to things that you think are likely to happen, but when referring to yourself, it shows determination rather than speculation. So we can translate this as I'm going to eat typography or I shall eat meat. By the way, I'm probably pronouncing this word to you, the way it's pronounced in Japanese. I live in Japan, so I've eaten a lot more top pogie here than in Korea. Adjectives when an adjective is in the predicative position, in other words, after the subject, then it functions similarly to a verb and is conjugated. Honeydew Pio, the sentence means the mountain is tall, the present tense, affix and polite affix are added to the adjective stem, just like a verb, and we can make this past tense to honeymoon.

Speaker 1:          15:37          Paso, the mountain was tall. This is conjugated, just like the past tense verb speech levels. When looking at verbs in the previous section, we looked mainly at the informal polite forms of verbs like Mateo from my Ada and I briefly mentioned that we could make the informal non polite form by removing your like Mata. These are two of seven politeness levels and Korean. Luckily for learners, not all, seven of them are commonly used, three or maybe four are commonly used. The other two are formal, polite, Manzanita, and formal, non polite Munda. The informal polite form is used when speaking to friends and acquaintances. Colleagues have a similar status to you, shop staff, et Cetera. The informal non polite form is used when speaking to very close friends, a brother or sister, someone a few years younger than you or someone you want to be rude to. The formal polite form is used when speaking to someone of higher status than you and people you are meeting for the first time.

Speaker 1:          16:40          The formal non polite form is basically a neutral forum that you can use when you don't know who the reader or listener is. In other words, when you're speaking to many types of people, it can also be used in speaking to friends of the same age range. Let's look at a couple more sentences in Korean and see what we find. This sentence means I have a bicycle but I don't have a car. None in has he been tackled so word for word it's I topic marker, Bicycle Subject Marker. There is, but car subject marker. There isn't. This sentence shows us how to express possession or have in Korean. The topic of the sentence is the possessor. Then the thing that is possessed is the subject of the sentence with a subject marker followed by the existence verb meaning there is or there are. Then we start a new sentence with but and there is a subject car with a subject marker followed by the negative verb of existence.

Speaker 1:          17:34          Meaning there isn't or there aren't. Notice that there's no topic in the second sentence. The topic can be skipped if it's already clear. Another sentence. This means this food is delicious. Did you cook it? You Michigan? Less so the word for word, it's this food topic marker, delicious, informal, polite, conjugation. You subject, marker. Cooking did informal, non polite conjugation. This first sentence follows a very common pattern. Here's the subject which is also the topic of the sentence with a topic marker and before the known we can see the demonstrative. He meaning this and here we have the adjective which is conjugated like a verb. In the second sentence, the subject is the word for you, followed by the subject marker. Ca Yodlee is the word for cooking or cuisine, and [inaudible] is the verb. Meaning do conjugated in the past tense, informal, non polite form. This is the same as the informal polite form with the syllable you'll removed from the end of both sentences when talking directly to someone.

Speaker 1:          18:36          It's very common to drop the subject. Pronouns, for example, God is so, but in this case, the subject and subject marker ca are included to emphasize you like did you cook it as opposed to someone else? Next, we see something very common and important. In Korean, we have a verb that consists of two parts, unknown of Chinese origin, followed by the verb, which means to do or to make. Many, many Korean verbs are constructed this way. For example, Eda meaning to work, meaning to study. There are also some words of English origin that form verbs. This way, for example, how will have meaning to shower. Let's look at one last sentence. Can you tune this sentence means she is a good student word for word, it's she topic marker. Good connector student. Be Informal, polite. So here we have the subject which is also the topic with a topic marker.

Speaker 1:          19:34          Then we have the adjective meaning good, and since it comes before the gnome, there's a connector. Huck saying means student and the verb is at the end. This verb is the informal polite form of EDA, which basically means to be and usually comes after nouns. There's also a negative form of this verb, Anita, so we could make this sentence negative like this Cunanan swoon. Now the sentence means she is not a good student. Noticed that in the negative form of this sentence, the subject marker, he comes after us saying, so with this particular verb, you have the topic and then the compliment actually becomes the subject of the sentence. There's really so much more I could say about Korean and there's no way I can cover everything in a single video, but hopefully that gave you a taste of the language and sparked your interest. In some ways, Korean is strikingly similar to Japanese, but in some ways it's quite different. You might want to check out my video from a couple of years ago on the differences and similarities between Korean and Japanese.
