Speaker 1:          00:00          Hey Mahmud, can you help me read this Arabic message I got and I can't recognize any of the words. Oh, that's not Arabic. Hello everyone. Welcome to the Lange focus channel. My name is Paul. In a recent video I talked about the Persian language which is spoken in Iran, Afghanistan and Tajikistan because Iran is located in the Middle East next to Iraq. A lot of people wonder if the Persian language and Arabic are related. Well they are not directly related but they have influenced each other. Persian and Arabic belonged to completely different language families, which means that they have separate origins. Arabic is a Semitic language and it comes from the same root language as Hebrew, Aramaic, phoenician, go riddick, et cetera. Persian on the other hand is an Indo European language, the shares common roots with the languages of northern India as well as most of the languages in Europe such as English, French and German.

Speaker 1:          00:53          Therefore, Persian and Arabic have very different grammar and the way that words are constructed is completely different. Semitic languages have a unique system of mostly three letter roots, and these three that are roots are put into templates that form the shape of different words. For example, the Arabic root for learn, which in English is like drs. If you want to say, I learn, you take those three root letters and you add them into this template here and say odd reus Persian does not have this system of putting the root into templates. The root words stay in one piece and affixes are attached to it. So let's look at an example in Persian using the root word done, which means no, the first word is [inaudible], which means to know. So if we add the ethics Istan, that creates the infinitive of the verb. The next word is dawn Nash, which means knowledge. So the ethics ash creates an abstract now than if we take that word and we add another ethics at the end. Donesh Monday, that means scientist. So that creates a concrete now. So you can see that nothing is changing with the route where.
