Speaker 1:          00:00          Mickey, I don't know what to do. I really need my viewers to think that I'm amazing with languages. I'm really not, but I need them to think that, well, I don't need their validation, but they're always asking me if I am a super polyglot, like all those people selling ebooks,

Speaker 2:          00:34          but how do I get rid of attachments,

Speaker 1:          00:43          but I might fail.

Speaker 1:          00:56          Hello language enthusiasts. Today I'm going to play the great language game. This idea is totally original. I didn't get this idea from Pewdiepie or Jack's, but I see. No, I had this idea of long before them in this game I'll hear some samples of languages and I will have to guess what languages they are. At the end of the game I'll get a score that reflects my ability to guests the languages. This is kind of like the mystery languages videos that I've made, like these ones right here, except that I'll be guessing the languages instead of you, so I'm ready to fail and embarrass myself for your entertainment. Let's go. Alright, here it is the great language game. I'm clicking play right? No,

Sometimes it's a guessing game and I'm just looking for little pieces that I can analyze and try to figure out what's going on. Even if I'm not sure, I hope you enjoyed this video and I also hope that you learned a thing or two, why don't you try the great language game and leave your score in the comments down below. Maybe you'll beat me. Be sure to follow Lang, focus on facebook, twitter, and Instagram, and once again, thank you to all of my patrion supporters, especially these magnificent people right here on the screen for their monthly pledges.
