Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello Youtube artificial intelligence bots. Please don't demonetize me. This video has nothing to do with brexit and there's absolutely nothing offensive about the word cockney. Today I want to examine a unique and extremely creative form of English slang called cockney rhyming slang. Cockneys are traditionally defined as people living within earshot of the bow bells of the Saint Marie Leveaux church in the east end of London, but the term cockney has come to refer to working class Londoners in various parts of the city and surrounding areas. Cockney rhyming slang was first mentioned in a book published in 1859 and had probably begun to be used in the 1840s so what the heck is it? Okay, I'll give you the most basic and cliche example of cockney rhyming slang.

Speaker 2:          00:45          I went up the Alpha one Perez,

Speaker 1:          00:47          the phrase apples and pears is a substitute for the word stairs. So you take a word that rhymes with the original word and then use it to create a pair of related words. That pair of words now represents the original word in this case stairs. Here's the most interesting part. The second word of the pear, the one that rhymes with the original word is usually left out as in, I went up the apples, but how are you supposed to know what it means? Well, originally this kind of slang was not meant to be understood by everybody. It was created by street merchants and criminals in order to prevent other people from understanding what they were talking about, but it soon became a colorful form of expression rather than just covert communication. Let's look at some more classic examples. We'll start with the word house. A rhyming word is mouse a complimentary where it is cat. So cat and mouse means house.

Speaker 2:          01:38          I went inside the canton mass and the apple and pears,

Speaker 1:          01:41          theoretically possible to shorten both of the rhymes and say the sentence,

Speaker 2:          01:45          I went inside the car and up the air force.

Speaker 1:          01:48          But it would probably be said the long wait in order to be less confusing. Here's another example using an animal word. The original word is phone. Phone rhymes with bone. What animals are normally associated with bones. Dogs of course. So dog and bone means a phone. So there's this sentence, pause this. The dog meaning passed me the phone in cockney speech, sometimes the plural pronoun us can be used with the singular meaning instead of me. Here's one more sort of household object freezer. A rhyming pair is Mona Lisa. Notice here that in my North American accent, Lisa and freezer don't run, but the cockney dialect and most dialects of England or non Roddick, meaning that the are consonants are only pronounced before.
