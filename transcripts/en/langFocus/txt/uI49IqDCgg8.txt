Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello everyone. Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and my name is Paul. Today's topic is the African's language. A couple of weeks ago I released a video on the Dutch language, which you can find right here. This is kind of a followup to that video because Afrikaans is a descendant of Dutch. That means that just like Dutch Afrikaans is a west Germanic language. Afrikaans has a total of about 7.1 million native speakers with 6.8 5 million of those in South Africa and that's about 13.5% of the South African population that makes it the third most widely spoken language in South Africa and it's the majority language in the western half of the country. That means Northern Cape and Western Cape provinces. It's the native language of about 61% of white South Africans and it's the native language of more than three quarters of quote unquote colored South Africans, about 3.4 million people in South Africa. The term colored, it means people love mixed racial background.

Speaker 1:          00:53          I didn't choose that term myself. It's also the native language of 4.6% of Asian South Africans. It's also the native language of 1.5% of black South Africans. That's about 600,000 people and there are 10 to 15000002nd language speakers in South Africa in Namibia. It's the native language of 10 or 11% of people, including 60% of the white population. It's also widely used as a Lingua Franca and most people can speak it as a second or third language. So how did the story of Afrikaans Begin? Dutch speaking settlers arrived in southern Africa in the year 1652 when the Dutch east India company set up a resupply station at Cape Town for its ships travelling to the Indian subcontinent and to Southeast Asia. Their goal was to get fresh water, food, and other supplies for their long sea journeys. When the local [inaudible] people, people who speak [inaudible] Sawn languages, we're unwilling to meet the trade demands of the Dutch east India company. The company drove them out of the area, into the inland and replaced them with European settlers and with slaves from other parts of Africa.

Speaker 1:          01:54          Most of the farmers who were known as borrowers were former laborers of the Dutch east India company, and most of them were Dutch, but some of them were French or German, too upset with the conditions placed upon them by the Dutch east India company. The European settlers began expanding inland so they could farm outside of the area controlled by the company. The Dutch east India company wanted to prevent this inland expansion, so they outlawed the expansion and did European immigration and increased the number of slaves. Instead, some of the slaves were brought from the Indian subcontinent and from present day Malaysia and Indonesia, Britain's seized control of the Cape Colony in 1815 and began to import British settlers. The British eventually took steps to eliminate slavery and to put heavy restrictions on the border of farmers. Large numbers of bowlers migrated further inland to escape British rule setting up their own communities and encountering various native African communities along the way.

Speaker 1:          02:43          After a series of conflicts with the British called the bowral wars, South Africa became a unified British colony until its independence in 1961 but this is lang focus. We're supposed to focus on languages. Why is all this history important? Well, it's to help you imagine the conditions under which the language spoken by those Dutch settlers changed and eventually became Afrikaans. Exactly. How Africans developed is a highly debated subject with some people insisting that it's a natural direct descendant of Dutch. While other people insist that it's actually a creole language that arose when slaves and laborers attempted to learn Dutch. If you're not sure what creole languages are, you can have a look at my video on pigeon and Creole languages right here. Nobody knows exactly what processes caused Afrikaans to develop, but it's unlikely that either of those two theories is 100% true. In the early years of the Cape Colony, there was a continuous stream of Dutch speaking immigrants as well as other Europeans who learn Dutch as a second language.

Speaker 1:          03:35          There were also many local speakers of [inaudible] languages who learned Dutch as a second language and there were also African and Asian slaves who learned Dutch as a second language. Local Africans and slaves most likely spoke a Dutch based pigeon language at some point. Typically a creole language arises when a pidgin language becomes the native language of the next generation, usually without a lot of influence from speakers of the original standard language. For example, slave owners or colonial settlers, but in the case of Africans, there was always extensive contact with native speakers of Dutch, more specifically the emerging dialect called Cape Dutch. On top of that standard Dutch and not Cape Dutch was the language that was taught in schools. Both of these factors would help. Cape Dutch remain relatively similar to standard Dutch, so even if Afrikaans is a creole language, it's more like a partial creole or a semi creole language to creole languages that I'm familiar with.

Speaker 1:          04:24          Our top pcn and be slammer which are spoken in Melanesia and they are english-based creoles. Both of those languages consist of mainly English vocabulary, but with the syntax, grammar and phonology of an oceanic language. They're essentially new languages that got their vocabulary from English, but Afrikaans is not like that. It's grammar became simplified, but the syntax of the language is basically the same as Dutch and it's phonology is also close to Dutch. So it seems that Africans developed from a form of Dutch that was influenced by second language speakers rather than a completely new creole language featuring Dutch vocabulary. That's my personal assessment, but I'm sure some people will disagree and that's fine. Africans continued to develop until it was legally recognized as its own language in 1925 so how was Afrikaans different from Dutch lone words? The vocabulary of Africans was influenced by the various languages that it came in contact with.

Speaker 1:          05:14          For example, Molay, the word meaning almost comes from the Malay word hum being the word bio meaning much comes from the Malay Word Been Yak Portuguese. The word combat meaning blanket comes from the Portuguese word. Who would the word cuddle? Meaning Catalan closure comes from the Portuguese word. Cool. How we have a similar word, corral and English cohesin languages. The words for a lot of things in the local African environment came from Khoisan languages. For example, plants and animals. This animal is called a Kudu. Good Dude. But the overwhelming majority of Africans vocabulary is Dutch, more than 90% or as high as 95% spelling. Africans underwent some spelling simplifications to make the written language more reflective of the spoken language. I won't mention all of the changes, but here are some examples. The Dutch diagraph Ij pronounced, I became just a y in Afrikaans. So we have the Dutch word could ice, which is spelled like this in Africans, but Dutch words ending with Lij, k pronounced as Lik are spelled l I K and Africans.

Speaker 1:          06:15          And that's a more accurate reflection of the real pronunciation. Lay Look. Lilach Dutch t I o n became Sio iom in Africans. So we have the Dutch word not show now and this became the spelling and Africans, these Dutch diphthongs, which are actually pronounced identically by many Dutch speakers, all became spelled, oh you in Afrikaans. So the Dutch words and though are spelled like this in Afrikaans, though, there are also some other spelling changes that represent new pronunciations and Africans, for example, Afrikaans merged the Dutch consonants,Z and s two a single celled spelt s so the Dutch word became so in Afrikaans, a similar phonetic change can also be found in the northern Netherlands, but it's not represented in writing only in speech. Afrikaans also merged together. The Dutch sounds represented by c h and g to a single sound spelled g and again a similar emerging also happened in the Netherlands, but not in spelling, only in sound in Afrikaans.

Speaker 1:          07:14          When the g sound is proceeded by an estimate as written as sk. So we have the Dutch word soul and the Africans word school between two vowels. The Dutch g and V consonants are omitted in Africans. Look at these Dutch words, oh, hood that Ethan, and now the Afrikaans equivalents the end. Notice that the second vowel requires a diacritic so that we know to pronounce these as two separate vowels and not as one diphthong. There are many more spelling changes, but those are a few examples to give you a sense of how things changed. Verbs, the verb system and Afrikaans is quite simple compared to Dutch. First of all, the simple past isn't used except for eight basic verbs for all other verbs. The perfect tense is used instead, which is also a possible in Dutch too. So here's the Dutch sentence, meaning I watched a cake and now here's the African sentence pack.

Speaker 1:          08:02          It's a cake. So notice that we use the perfect tense in Afrikaans because there is no past tense. But this African sentence is similar to the Dutch perfect 10th sentence. [inaudible]. But notice that the way the past participle is formed is a little different. Also notice that the form of the verb for have is different. These are both the present tense form of the verb, meaning to have the one in Dutchess conjugated for first person singular, but Africans verbs don't change according to person or a number. So the Dutch verb will change and other sentences. But in Afrikaans it will always be hate. There was also no plu perfect tents in Africans who perfect is like had watched instead. The perfect form would be used. So let's just jump into a few more examples, sentences and look at these differences as well as some others. The next sentences mean I talked to my children in Dutch.

Speaker 1:          08:46          You kept mets men getting it into grouts and an Afrikaans. I could fit my goodness. First of all, notice the difference in personal pronouns in Dutch and an Afrikaans and then notice the different forms of the verb meaning to have the next word met means width. And next we can see that the possessive pronouns are different in Dutch and an Afrikaans May. Next is the word for children, but notice that the plural form is different. Notice that the word order is exactly the same and that the second verb goes at the end in Afrikaans, which is the same as in Dutch and also the same as in German. The next sentences mean did you have a good new year? First in Dutch have gi hooten, new hub and an Afrikaans and English. It's like have you a good new year? Head again. We see the different forms of the verb meaning to have.

Speaker 1:          09:35          Then we see the different spelling of the personal pronoun. Yeah, Yay. Meaning you. Then we have the indefinite article, which has been shortened in Afrikaans. Then notice that the word for good is slightly different. Then after that, notice the slight difference in the words for a new year. And finally the past participle of the verb meaning to have is the same in both sentences. Now let's look at a similar sentence, but with a little change. This one means did he have a good new year in Dutch? Hey Cy, a hoot, new Yamaha and an Afrikaans. Look at the first word and notice that the Dutch verb conjugation changes. This is the third person singular form of the verb. The verb form stays the same in Afrikaans and next we see that the personal pronoun, high e meaning he is spelled differently. After that, the rest of the words are the same as in the sentence is up above.

Speaker 1:          10:17          The next sentences mean we will live. We will die in Dutch, Missoula, Lavan, Zilla, Stephan, and in Afrikaans on Saul starbuck. Notice here that the subject Pronoun for week is different in Dutch, the subject pronouns as va, but the object pronoun similar to us in English, his aunts in Africans owns is both the subject and the object Pronoun. Next, notice that the future tense in Dutch is formed using Xulane plus the infinitive in Afrikaans. It's formed by using sal plus the verb and there really isn't an infinitive and Afrikaans, so there's just one single verb form. This part here is the same as the present tense form, so we can see that there are some differences between Dutch and Africans, but generally the vocabulary is very similar and probably very easy to recognize. Once you're aware of those general differences and the word order is basically the same.

Speaker 1:          11:06          So how well can Dutch speakers and African speakers understand each other? The answer to this question depends on who you ask, but generally they seem to be mutually intelligible to a moderate level. With African speakers being able to understand the Dutch better than Dutch speakers can understand. Afrikaans, there are a couple of important factors and intelligibility. One of them is accent. I've heard from a few Dutch people and from a few Africans people that they can understand certain speakers of the other language very well but other speakers are a partner to understand and that might be because certain Dutch dialects have pronunciation that is more similar to Africans than others and there are also a lot of second language speakers of Afrikaans who's accent might be difficult for native Dutch speakers to understand. Another factor is register register means the level of formality used. Now if the speakers of both languages use the standard formal variety of their language and they don't use any local variations or slang, then they'll probably understand each other much better.

Speaker 1:          11:58          Formal speech basically resembles the written language and the speakers of either language can basically understand the other one when it's written. A common question that I see written on the Internet is should I learn Afrikaans before learning Dutch? Would that help me to learn Dutch later on? I would say that that's probably a bad idea to learn afrikaans just because you want to learn Dutch later, it's probably would end up confusing you when you learn Dutch later on because Dutch is similar to Africans, but more complex. I would say that the best reason to learn Afrikaans would be because you have a deep cultural interest in South Africa and you want to spend some time in that country or in Namibia. So the question of the day for speakers of Africans and Dutch, how well can you guys understand each other? Leave your comments and your experiences down below. And for everyone else, I don't have a question of the day. So why don't you ask a question to the Africans and Dutch speakers? That sounds good. Be sure to follow lane, focus on facebook, twitter, and instagram. And I want to say thanks to all of my patrion supporters for continuing to make Lang focus possible. Thank you for watching and have a nice day.
