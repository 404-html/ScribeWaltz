Speaker 1:          00:05          Hello everyone. Welcome to the Lange focus channel. In. My name is Paul. Today's topic is the languages of Italy. As you probably know, Italy is located in Europe on the Mediterranean Sea and shares borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia in San Marino. Why not call this video the Italian language?

Speaker 1:          00:26          That's because Italian, as we normally think of it, is not the only language of Italy in Italy. There have historically been many different local varieties of speech that developed from Vulgar Latin. These dialects differ significantly from one locale to another, but they can be grouped together with other similar dialects and those groups have dialects, can be considered regional languages. One of these groups have dialects, is Tuscan for Tulsa, Donald, which forms the basis of standard Italian to be precise. The Tuscan dialect of Florence spoken in the 15th, 16th centuries formed the basis of standard Italian. The modern Tuscan dialects, which vary from place to place, are spoken by around three point $5, million people, mainly in Tuscany, Umbria, and a couple of locales on the islands of Sardinia and Corsica. Standard Italian on the other hand, is spoken by most of Italy, 60 million people. It's now learned universally by Italians because it's the language of education and the media and in many areas, especially urban areas, it has largely replaced the traditional regional languages in most of the country, say from around Rome to the north.

Speaker 1:          01:31          The regional languages are used mostly amongst the elderly and in more casual speech, especially outside of the larger cities in the south of the country, specifically in companion, Calabria and Sicily as well as Sardinia. Regional languages are more widely spoken, but the trend is that the regional languages are fading for the most part. Why? When it's only became a nation in 18, 61, the policy was to Italian people in all the different regions of the new country. This was done by making Italian the sole language of education and of media and of government. Also internal migration of people seeking new industrial jobs brought the speakers of different regional languages together, forcing them to speak standard Italian in order to communicate in such regions. Notably in the north, the regional languages have faded more quickly. Data from the Italian National Institute of Statistics shows that around half of Italians speak mainly Italian with their families and friends, and this number rises to 72 point eight percent when speaking to strangers, about 33 percent of people speak both Italian and their dialect with family and friends, and 19 percent with strangers.

Speaker 1:          02:38          Sixteen percent speak only their dialect with their families. 13 point two percent speak only in dialect with their friends and five point four percent with strangers. Notice that I wrote the word dialect with quotation marks. We have to be careful with that word dialect because it might suggest that these regional languages are varieties of standard Italian varieties of Tuscan, but they are not varieties of Italian or Tuscan from which Italian derived they developed in parallel with Tuscan their dialect in the sense that there are many different local varieties of speech, but they are not dialects of one single language. These dialects are often quite different from each other and they are grouped together based on their historical development. There are common features and their mutual intelligibility and can be thought of as languages, but most of these languages are not standardized and exactly how to group the dialects together is not always clear and standard Italian spread and began to replace the traditional regional languages.

Speaker 1:          03:33          Some features of those traditional languages made their way into standard Italian in each area. This resulted in different dialects of standard Italian, mostly different accents and also some casual vocabulary adopted from those regional languages. Some of Italy's language groups are recognized as historic language minorities such as Albanian, German, Greek, Slovenian, Croatian French Frankel, provont sal for Julian Ladene, oxytocin, Katelyn and Sardinian. Some of these are not romance languages and some of them are national languages or regional languages in other nearby countries. It's also worth noting that the language is on this list that are specific to Italy all have standard written forms which may be part of the reason they are recognized as minority languages and not mere dialects. Other such languages with standard written forms are Piedmontese, the European and Venetian. The regional language with the largest number of speakers is neapolitan or mobility. It is spoken by around five point 7 million people, primarily in bustled, Lazio, a brute, so and Malisa Pouliot, Basilicata and parts of Calabria like standard Italian and Tuscan.

Speaker 1:          04:43          It is part of the Italo Dalmatian branch of the romance languages and it has some degree of intelligibility for speakers of Italian, but it's also influenced by Spanish, French and Arabic. This is not one of the recognized minority languages and is often considered a dialect. In Italy, though it's very reasonable to consider it a separate language. The second most widely spoken is Sicilian or Siciliano. It is spoken by around four point 7 million people, primarily in Sicily and in parts of Calabria. It is also an Italo Dalmatian language like Neapolitan Sicilian has been influenced by foreign languages. Greek, Arabic, Spanish, Katelyn and French. Sicilian is sometimes said to be the oldest romance language, meaning it was the earliest language to split off from vulgar Latin, but not everyone accepts this idea. This is not one of the recognized minority languages, either another is Venetian or Veneto, which is spoken by around three point $9 million people in the Veneto region as well as a neighboring Trentino Alto, our Dj and Friuli Veneto Julia.

Speaker 1:          05:47          The nation was a language of prestige and the time of the Venetian republic and Venetian was an important part of the Mediterranean Lingua Franca, also known as severe, a regional pigeon language spoken between the 11th and 19th centuries. This is also not one of the recognized minority languages. Next is Lombard or Lombardo, which is spoken by three point 6 million people, mainly in the lumbar region and parts of neighboring regions. It is part of the Gallo Italia Romance Branch, along with the Durian and Piedmontese Piedmontese or pmo and pays is spoken by around one point 6 million people mainly in the Piedmont region of northwestern Italy. The gear in or Laguna is spoken by around 500,000 people in the [inaudible] region. Another Gallo metallic language is Emilia-romagna. All this language consists of two closely related dialect groups, a million and Roman Yoel. It is spoken by around one point seven, 3 million people, mainly in the region of Emilia Romania.

Speaker 1:          06:47          This is not a recognized minority language. Next is Sardinian or suicide to do. It is spoken by around 1 million people, mainly on the island of Sardinia. Sardinian is not part of the Italo Dalmatian branch, but forms of separate Sardinian branch of romance languages, so it's less intelligible for speakers of Italian. Then Neapolitan or Sicilian. Sardinian is a recognized minority language. Next is Freudian or foot lung, which is spoken in the northeastern region of Friuli by around 600,000 native speakers. It is a retail romance language that is related to another language in northeast Italy. Ladene as well as the role. Much language spoken in Switzerland for Julian is a recognized minority language. Ladene is also a recognized minority language and a spoken by around 50,000 people. There are also the central Italian dialects or the [inaudible]. They are spoken in Lazio, Umbria, central Medicaid, the southern part of Tuscany, and part of a brutal.

Speaker 1:          07:47          These dialects are closely related with each other and with Tuscan, and they're all part of the Tallow Dalmatian branch. These are thought of as Italian dialects rather than separate languages, even though they didn't develop from Tuscan, but developed as sister dialects to Tuscan. There are around 3 million speakers of these dialects. Keep in mind that the number of speakers for these regional languages might be misleading because virtually everybody has also fluent in standard Italian and their use of the regional languages might be limited to certain situations. For example, in communicating with their elderly relatives in smaller numbers, there are also the languages spoken in neighboring countries either as regional or national languages. German through are about 293,000 speakers in northern areas of Italy adjacent to Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Franco provolone solve has around 90,000 speakers in the north near France, mostly in Piedmont. Albanian has around 80,000 speakers.

Speaker 1:          08:41          Slovene has around 70,000 speakers near the border with Slovenia. Oxytocin has around 40,000 speakers in Piedmont and the Judea. Katelyn is spoken by around 20,000 people in the city of alligator on Sardinia, which began as a Katelyn settlement. Keeping in mind that the regional romance languages are generally considered dialects in Italy. I thought it would be fun to have a look at some of them at see how similar or different they are. Let's look at standard Italian Neapolitan Sardinian and for Uli in it, allegedly, this means I would like something to read word for word. It's would like first person singular, something to read and to Neapolitan whooley causality. Judah here, the words all correspond and if you're looking for it, you can see the connection between the words, but the words are also different enough to make comprehensive difficult neapolitan words are often shorter than the Italian equivalence with final vowels or final syllables reduced.

Speaker 1:          09:38          In Italian, there's vote a. This becomes valueless in Neapolitan. I've also seen this spelled with an e at the end. Neapolitan spelling is not standardized. Italian quality causa is Qaqc course in Neapolitan. The Italian preposition dot meaning from or buy, but also used to be for an infinitive like this becomes our in the Apollo. Isn't the word for reed is similar except the final vowel sound after our is more like the Schwab in the Apollo written more like an ah sound. Unstressed. Vowels often sounds like Schwab in the Apollo isn't and these reduced vowels are sometimes not written in Sardinian. You have all the lead, unlike an Italian Neapolitan in which the Personal Pronoun Ego was dropped here, it's included and didn't Sardinian it's Ia, but I believe this can also be dropped in. Sardinian boldly is the conditional form of the verb which comes from the same root as the Italian Neapolitan once, but it takes on a different form and Sardinian here.

Speaker 1:          10:36          Quality Coza is represented by two words, I believe means some on its own. Here at the preposition is slightly different and then we have the verb meaning to read, which is obviously related to the others, but the infinitive is formed differently and in Freeland evil that is here we see the personal pronoun. He in Freeland, this can't be dropped. The verb here clearly comes from the same root as the others, but this one takes on quite a different form and as a learner of Italian, I might mistake this for the Italian word velocity, which means to fly. The word for something is out. I don't actually know the root of this word, but the way I'll remember it is that it sounds like the middle of quality. Cool. Now I'll never forget this word here. Notice the slightly different preposition and notice the infinitive of the verb, meaning to read.

Speaker 1:          11:26          This looks quite different from the Italian word, but it looks rather similar to the French word Leah or Spanish layer. So far. You can probably notice a lot of similarity when you look at the sentences, but there's also enough difference to make these mutually unintelligible to a large extent. When they're spoken Miano date that is solely owned Digi. This sentence means they told me that we will arrive around 11:00 word for word. It's to me, they have said that we will arrive around the 11 in the Apollo written modernity took here we see that the object pronoun contracts with the verb and notice again that a neapolitan, the final vowel becomes reduced to a Schwa sound. The main verb here that he is the equivalent of Ditto in Italian, d sounds in Italian, often correspond to our sounds in Neapolitan. The Word K is pronounced cook when unstressed and contracts with the following verb because of its initial vowel sound, the Italian word or got a mall is a vm in Neapolitan pay is the equivalent of pad in Italian, meaning for the wounded she becomes liquid in the show.

Speaker 1:          12:37          Once again, notice all those reduced sounds in Sardinian monthly. Now do by region. Here we can see that similar to the other languages in Sardinia in the past can be expressed by using the auxiliary verb, meaning to have, even though it looks quite different, the unsound is a hint. The main verb, however, is different. I'll speculate that this for now is related to the Latin verb. Not meaning to tell or narrate, though I'm not sure. Okay. In Italian is cut the future tenses from differently and Sardinian with an auxiliary verb. Here, instead of [inaudible], we see a candidate which is similar to the Italian preposition, a controller, which means beside here we have a different definite article and wounded. She becomes wound Digi inferiorly and inferiorly and it seems that rather than use a specific indirect object, pronouns to preposition is used with the object pronouns like to me here on dee dee is the past tense, formed the same way as an Italian Neapolitan, but with different forms.

Speaker 1:          13:46          Here we have the subject pronouns which is not necessary and the other languages, and here we have the verb for arrive, but you might not have immediately recognized it because it begins with a single are rather than an a and a double are told is the preposition meaning around and dish is own. She will do it for a trestle. This sentence means I have two brothers and three sisters, word for word. It's have first person, singular present tense, two brothers and three sisters in Neapolitan. Doing good grief. Raga in the Italian sentence, notice that the verb for how is a form of the verb of ETA, but in the Neapolitan sentence, it's taking the. This is similar to the word used in Spanish. In Italian there's a word like this, tenacity, which would be 10 goal in the first person singular, but that means to hold in your hand, not to have in the general sense here. The word for to is slightly different. Here. The word for brothers is flat rather than fill out daily, and the word for sisters is also shortened Soda Rather Than Soda. And notice that the production of the endings make the gender of nouns somewhat unclear. In this case, of course, we know because of their meaning, but with other nouns, the gender might be less clear in Sardinian.

Speaker 1:          15:04          Here's the verb tense is similar to the Neapolitan. One Tango to is deuce rather than do it, and three is today's rather than three. Both the verb and the numbers remind me of Spanish here next. Friday's and Saudis mean brother and sister respectively, and notice that they formed the plural by adding an s. This is how it's done in many romance languages, but not in standard Italian in which the final vowel of the word indicates number in for Julian. Again, we see that the Pronoun can't be dropped in for your lead. Here we see the verb to have, which is a cognate with the verb and the Italian sentence. Unlike the ones in the Neapolitan and Sardinian sentences, it's pronounced it, but you can see a connection with the French word a to his dose, like in Spanish. The word for brother is basically the same as the Sardinian word, and the plural is formed by adding s.

Speaker 1:          15:58          The word for sister Sol is like the French word, so as you can see from these examples, there's a lot of linguistic diversity in Italy with regional languages and their local dialects having their own colorful features that reflect the history and the traditions of their speakers. Many of these languages and dialects are endangered and risk being completely replaced by standard Italian. In the coming generations. There are some efforts to preserve these languages, but will they succeed? And that brings me to the question of the day for people who speak both Italian and another language of Italy, how often do you use your traditional local language and in what situations and for learners of Italian has the influence of these traditional languages and dialects ever affected your communication with native speakers? Let us know in the comments down below. Be sure to follow lane, focus on facebook, twitter, and instagram. And once again, thank you to all of my wonderful patrion supporters, especially these ones right here on the screen for their monthly pledges. Thank you for watching and have a nice day.
