<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is Paul and you are watching the </v>

2
00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:04.503
<v Speaker 1>lane focus channel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today I'm going to talk about language </v>

3
00:00:06.931 --> 00:00:10.920
<v Speaker 1>learning edge number three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that edge is meditation,</v>

4
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.230
<v Speaker 1>so you might be thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the heck does meditation have to do</v>

5
00:00:19.231 --> 00:00:20.580
<v Speaker 1>with language learning?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

6
00:00:20.581 --> 00:00:23.670
<v Speaker 1>it has a couple of big benefits that can</v>
<v Speaker 1>really affect your results,</v>

7
00:00:23.671 --> 00:00:26.460
<v Speaker 1>so I wanted to share it with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something that I do all the time,</v>

8
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.790
<v Speaker 1>but I want to make clear that this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>not religious meditation.</v>

9
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.953
<v Speaker 1>If you have your own religion and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>worried that maybe this is Buddhism or </v>

10
00:00:33.871 --> 00:00:35.760
<v Speaker 1>some other religion that uses </v>
<v Speaker 1>meditation.</v>

11
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.710
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not teaching you that.</v>

12
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:38.603
<v Speaker 1>I'm just talking about how to relax your</v>
<v Speaker 1>body and also your mind so that you can </v>

13
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:47.060
<v Speaker 1>focus and learn more efficiently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

14
00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:49.473
<v Speaker 1>well let me talk about some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefits that meditation has for your </v>

15
00:00:52.421 --> 00:00:53.254
<v Speaker 1>language learning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of them is that it puts you in an </v>

16
00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:56.163
<v Speaker 1>ideal learning state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>puts you in something called an Alpha </v>

17
00:00:58.331 --> 00:00:59.164
<v Speaker 1>state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means that your brain waves are </v>

18
00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:01.563
<v Speaker 1>moving at a slower speed than they are </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you normally go throughout your </v>

19
00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:09.120
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you normally go about your day,</v>

20
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.270
<v Speaker 1>you are in a Beta state in your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>waves are moving.</v>
