00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:09.673
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2
00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.970
<v Speaker 2>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Welcome to the line focus channel and my</v>

3
00:00:12.971 --> 00:00:13.804
<v Speaker 2>name is Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Today I'm going to talk about the </v>

4
00:00:15.671 --> 00:00:17.530
<v Speaker 2>Turkish language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

5
00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.393
<v Speaker 2>right off the bat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first thing I want to say is that </v>

6
00:00:19.991 --> 00:00:20.824
<v Speaker 2>there is a Turkish language because </v>
<v Speaker 2>Turkey is situated at the edge of the </v>

7
00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:25.743
<v Speaker 2>Middle East.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people think that Turkey is an </v>

8
00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.470
<v Speaker 2>Arabic country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is not an Arabic country.</v>

9
00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:30.423
<v Speaker 2>The language of Turkey is Turkish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although there is a small Arabic </v>

10
00:00:33.431 --> 00:00:34.264
<v Speaker 2>speaking minority in Turkey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are around 75 million native </v>

11
00:00:37.061 --> 00:00:40.240
<v Speaker 2>speakers of Turkish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That includes 10 to 15 million people in</v>

12
00:00:40.241 --> 00:00:42.880
<v Speaker 2>southeastern Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's mainly in the part of Turkey,</v>

13
00:00:42.881 --> 00:00:43.714
<v Speaker 2>that's located in Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also as a minority language in the </v>

14
00:00:46.211 --> 00:00:47.044
<v Speaker 2>Balkan area,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it includes 60 to 65 million people </v>

15
00:00:49.631 --> 00:00:52.330
<v Speaker 2>in Anatolia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the part of Turkey that's located</v>

16
00:00:52.331 --> 00:00:55.540
<v Speaker 2>inside of Asia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now those numbers are for Turkish,</v>

17
00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:56.403
<v Speaker 2>but there are other languages inside the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Turkic language family that have a </v>

18
00:00:59.531 --> 00:01:02.530
<v Speaker 2>relatively high degree of mutual </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligibility,</v>

19
00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.160
<v Speaker 2>and some people consider those languages</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be dialects of Turkish.</v>

20
00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.993
<v Speaker 2>So if we include those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the number might be as high as 109 </v>

21
00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.193
<v Speaker 2>million people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let's back up and look at the </v>

22
00:01:12.191 --> 00:01:13.024
<v Speaker 2>classification of Turkish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because Turkey is located partly inside </v>

23
00:01:15.731 --> 00:01:16.564
<v Speaker 2>of Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might have thought that Turkish is </v>

24
00:01:17.561 --> 00:01:18.394
<v Speaker 2>an Indo European language or a Slavic </v>
<v Speaker 2>language and because part of Turkey is </v>

25
00:01:21.581 --> 00:01:24.850
<v Speaker 2>located on the edge of the Middle East,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might have thought that Turkish is a</v>

26
00:01:24.851 --> 00:01:27.010
<v Speaker 2>Semitic language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is none of the above.</v>

27
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.340
<v Speaker 2>The Turkic language family is a separate</v>
<v Speaker 2>family unto itself.</v>

28
00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:31.203
<v Speaker 2>The Turkic languages are sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought to be a part of larger language </v>

29
00:01:34.061 --> 00:01:36.220
<v Speaker 2>family called the [inaudible] language </v>
<v Speaker 2>family,</v>

30
00:01:36.221 --> 00:01:37.054
<v Speaker 2>which includes some other language </v>
<v Speaker 2>groups like the Mongolian language </v>

31
00:01:39.221 --> 00:01:42.730
<v Speaker 2>family that Japonica and the chorionic </v>
<v Speaker 2>language family amongst others,</v>

32
00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.930
<v Speaker 2>but this is not a generally accepted </v>
<v Speaker 2>theory bilinguist it tends to be debated</v>

33
00:01:46.931 --> 00:01:49.510
<v Speaker 2>and these days it seems to be fairly </v>
<v Speaker 2>discredited.</v>

34
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.930
<v Speaker 2>Turkish is part of the ohs branch of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Turkic language family.</v>

35
00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:53.763
<v Speaker 2>It also includes Azerbaijani,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is sometimes called Azeri Turkish </v>

36
00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.610
<v Speaker 2>as well as Turkmen as well as some other</v>
<v Speaker 2>languages like Qashqai,</v>

37
00:02:00.611 --> 00:02:01.444
<v Speaker 2>which is spoken in some parts of Iran.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The languages of the ohs branch are all </v>

38
00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:05.763
<v Speaker 2>mutually intelligible to some extent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and these are the languages that are </v>

39
00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:11.500
<v Speaker 2>sometimes considered to be dialects of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Turkish Azeri.</v>

40
00:02:11.501 --> 00:02:15.040
<v Speaker 2>Turkish is spoken in Azerbaijan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>them as well as parts of Iran,</v>

41
00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.390
<v Speaker 2>Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dagestan,</v>

42
00:02:16.391 --> 00:02:19.780
<v Speaker 2>and Georgia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it has 26 million native speakers.</v>

43
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.440
<v Speaker 2>Turkmen has 8 million native speakers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including 3.5</v>

44
00:02:23.441 --> 00:02:27.820
<v Speaker 2>million in Turkmenistan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2 million in northwestern Iran and 1.5</v>

45
00:02:27.821 --> 00:02:28.654
<v Speaker 2>million in northwestern Afghanistan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All Turkic languages descended from a </v>

46
00:02:32.051 --> 00:02:34.570
<v Speaker 2>theoretical language called [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 2>Turkish.</v>

47
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:37.130
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

48
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.300
<v Speaker 2>The Turkic peoples originated in Central</v>
<v Speaker 2>Asia and through migration they expanded</v>

49
00:02:41.301 --> 00:02:42.134
<v Speaker 2>over a wide area extending all the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>from Siberia down through China and </v>

50
00:02:45.741 --> 00:02:46.574
<v Speaker 2>Central Asia through the Middle East,</v>
<v Speaker 2>up into the Balkan area and even north </v>

51
00:02:50.061 --> 00:02:50.894
<v Speaker 2>of the Black Sea owes Turkic the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ancestor language of modern day Turkish </v>

52
00:02:54.201 --> 00:02:55.034
<v Speaker 2>language as well as all the languages of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ohs branch was brought to Anatolia </v>

53
00:02:58.581 --> 00:03:02.800
<v Speaker 2>by the Seljuk Empire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Turkic Empire in the 11th century Ce.</v>

54
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:03.783
<v Speaker 2>The seljuk empire had previously adopted</v>
<v Speaker 2>Islam and they were admirers of Persian </v>

55
00:03:07.301 --> 00:03:11.080
<v Speaker 2>culture and they were influenced by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Persian language and the Arabic language</v>

56
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.930
<v Speaker 2>person became the administrative and </v>
<v Speaker 2>literary language.</v>

57
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.420
<v Speaker 2>While Arabic was used for religious </v>
<v Speaker 2>purposes,</v>

58
00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.420
<v Speaker 2>but Turkish was still spoken by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>average common people.</v>

59
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.250
<v Speaker 2>Later when the Ottoman empire a rose in </v>
<v Speaker 2>place of the Seljuk Empire,</v>

60
00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.153
<v Speaker 2>the official language would be a form of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Turkish that was highly influenced by </v>

61
00:03:27.251 --> 00:03:28.084
<v Speaker 2>Persian and Arabic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This form of Turkish became known as </v>

62
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:31.690
<v Speaker 2>ultimate Turkish.</v>

63
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.120
<v Speaker 2>Ottoman Turkish was big stone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Turkish grammar,</v>

64
00:03:34.121 --> 00:03:36.880
<v Speaker 2>but with some influence from Persian and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Arabic grammar,</v>

65
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.600
<v Speaker 2>but it was the vocabulary that was most </v>
<v Speaker 2>influenced by Persian and Arabic.</v>

66
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.890
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes up to 88% of the vocabulary </v>
<v Speaker 2>used was Persian and Arabic.</v>

67
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.990
<v Speaker 2>This was the language of the elite </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

68
00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.440
<v Speaker 2>not the language of the common people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which had much less foreign influence,</v>

69
00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.630
<v Speaker 2>although it did still have some foreign </v>
<v Speaker 2>influence.</v>

70
00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.880
<v Speaker 2>When the modern republic of Turkey was </v>
<v Speaker 2>founded.</v>

71
00:03:54.881 --> 00:03:55.714
<v Speaker 2>In 1923 Mustafa came out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ataturk created the Turkish language </v>

72
00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.800
<v Speaker 2>association to initiate a reform of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Turkish language.</v>

73
00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.560
<v Speaker 2>He essentially got rid of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>administrative language,</v>

74
00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:06.443
<v Speaker 2>Ottoman Turkish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he replaced it with a new standard </v>

75
00:04:08.231 --> 00:04:09.064
<v Speaker 2>language based on the everyday common </v>
<v Speaker 2>language spoken in Istanbul and effort </v>

76
00:04:12.911 --> 00:04:16.690
<v Speaker 2>was made to replace Persian and Arabic </v>
<v Speaker 2>words with native Turkish words.</v>

77
00:04:16.691 --> 00:04:20.230
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes those were archaic Turkish </v>
<v Speaker 2>words that were brought back to life and</v>

78
00:04:20.231 --> 00:04:21.064
<v Speaker 2>sometimes they were newly created </v>
<v Speaker 2>Turkish words taken from Turkish roots </v>

79
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.880
<v Speaker 2>and other big changes that Turkish was </v>
<v Speaker 2>switched from the Arabic alphabet,</v>

80
00:04:27.881 --> 00:04:31.030
<v Speaker 2>the Arabic writing system to a modified </v>
<v Speaker 2>Latin alphabet,</v>

81
00:04:31.031 --> 00:04:33.520
<v Speaker 2>which was much more suitable for reading</v>
<v Speaker 2>and writing.</v>

82
00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.353
<v Speaker 2>Turkish Arabic has only three short </v>
<v Speaker 2>vowels and three long vowels while the </v>

83
00:04:38.321 --> 00:04:39.154
<v Speaker 2>Turkish language has eight vowels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that created a lot of confusion in </v>

84
00:04:42.101 --> 00:04:42.934
<v Speaker 2>reading and writing in Turkish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the literacy rates had always been </v>

85
00:04:45.311 --> 00:04:46.144
<v Speaker 2>very low,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but after switching to the Latin </v>

86
00:04:47.801 --> 00:04:49.990
<v Speaker 2>alphabet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the literacy rates skyrocketed.</v>

87
00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.913
<v Speaker 2>What the common people haven't always </v>
<v Speaker 2>accepted the suggestions by the Turkish </v>

88
00:04:53.861 --> 00:04:54.694
<v Speaker 2>language association.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So some of those foreign loan words in </v>

89
00:04:56.921 --> 00:05:00.040
<v Speaker 2>Turkish still exist alongside and native</v>
<v Speaker 2>Turkish words.</v>

90
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.140
<v Speaker 2>So sometimes there are two words for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same thing,</v>

91
00:05:02.141 --> 00:05:06.190
<v Speaker 2>one Turkish and one Persian or Arabic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they might have the same meaning,</v>

92
00:05:06.191 --> 00:05:07.024
<v Speaker 2>but they're used in a slightly different</v>
<v Speaker 2>way or have a slightly different sense </v>

93
00:05:09.491 --> 00:05:10.324
<v Speaker 2>to the meaning before I mentioned the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Azeri language as well as the Turkmen </v>

94
00:05:13.061 --> 00:05:13.894
<v Speaker 2>language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are sometimes considered a </v>

95
00:05:14.751 --> 00:05:15.584
<v Speaker 2>dialects of Turkish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they are actually more similar to </v>

96
00:05:18.191 --> 00:05:22.450
<v Speaker 2>the Turkish that was spoken before </v>
<v Speaker 2>auditors reform of the Turkish language.</v>

97
00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:25.630
<v Speaker 2>That is to say that they use more </v>
<v Speaker 2>Persian and Arabic loan words.</v>

98
00:05:25.631 --> 00:05:30.040
<v Speaker 2>Then the modern day standard Turkish of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Turkey uses and also Azerbaijan.</v>

99
00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.460
<v Speaker 2>Turkmenistan were under the control of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the USSR for a long time.</v>

100
00:05:33.461 --> 00:05:36.910
<v Speaker 2>So there are also some Russian loan </v>
<v Speaker 2>words and from what I understand,</v>

101
00:05:36.911 --> 00:05:37.744
<v Speaker 2>there are a lot of funny </v>
<v Speaker 2>misunderstandings between the different </v>

102
00:05:39.581 --> 00:05:42.340
<v Speaker 2>varieties of Turkish Azerbaijani or </v>
<v Speaker 2>Azeri.</v>

103
00:05:42.341 --> 00:05:43.174
<v Speaker 2>Turkish was always referred to as </v>
<v Speaker 2>Turkish until the Soviet Union </v>

104
00:05:46.031 --> 00:05:46.864
<v Speaker 2>controlled Azerbaijan and they changed </v>
<v Speaker 2>the name of that language as a way of </v>

105
00:05:49.811 --> 00:05:54.040
<v Speaker 2>trying to create an identity for those </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that was separate from the people</v>

106
00:05:54.041 --> 00:05:54.874
<v Speaker 2>in Turkey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was another divide and conquer </v>

107
00:05:56.531 --> 00:05:57.364
<v Speaker 2>tactic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just from reading some comments around </v>

108
00:05:58.791 --> 00:05:59.624
<v Speaker 2>the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the level of intelligibility between </v>

109
00:06:01.341 --> 00:06:02.174
<v Speaker 2>standard Turkish and Azeri Turkish </v>
<v Speaker 2>varies from 60% to 90% but even for the </v>

110
00:06:07.371 --> 00:06:08.204
<v Speaker 2>people who understand less of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems that they get used to it quite </v>

111
00:06:10.881 --> 00:06:11.714
<v Speaker 2>quickly and it's simply a matter of </v>
<v Speaker 2>familiarity and a little bit of </v>

112
00:06:14.121 --> 00:06:14.780
<v Speaker 2>adjustment.</v>

113
00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:15.613
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one guy wrote in his comment that if a </v>

114
00:06:17.091 --> 00:06:19.820
<v Speaker 2>Turkish person takes an airplane to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Azerbaijan,</v>

115
00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:22.490
<v Speaker 2>maybe in the morning he won't really </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand very well,</v>

116
00:06:22.491 --> 00:06:24.890
<v Speaker 2>but by the afternoon he'll be completely</v>
<v Speaker 2>fluent.</v>

117
00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.873
<v Speaker 2>And if that is the case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I would definitely say that those </v>

118
00:06:27.381 --> 00:06:29.510
<v Speaker 2>are just two dialects of the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>language.</v>

119
00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:32.570
<v Speaker 2>So let's look at some features of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Turkish language.</v>

120
00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:33.493
<v Speaker 2>Turkish is an a gluten native language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A glutenous of means that the words are </v>

121
00:06:36.891 --> 00:06:40.250
<v Speaker 2>comprised of pieces that all add to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning of the word.</v>

122
00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:41.113
<v Speaker 2>So whereas in English,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might express something with a few </v>

123
00:06:43.221 --> 00:06:44.300
<v Speaker 2>words.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In Turkish,</v>

124
00:06:44.301 --> 00:06:47.150
<v Speaker 2>that might just be one word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or it might be fewer words,</v>

125
00:06:47.151 --> 00:06:47.984
<v Speaker 2>because instead of using an extra word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just add an extra piece to the word </v>

126
00:06:51.171 --> 00:06:52.004
<v Speaker 2>you're already using,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that means you can sometimes get </v>

127
00:06:53.481 --> 00:06:54.314
<v Speaker 2>some surprisingly long words in Turkish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's look at an example of a gluten </v>

128
00:06:57.981 --> 00:06:59.500
<v Speaker 2>nation thought to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

129
00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:04.770
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to bscs Tattoo bscs Lik Tattoo</v>
<v Speaker 2>bscs licked Larry [inaudible] that in.</v>

130
00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:08.870
<v Speaker 2>Then that'd be a sizzling that in done </v>
<v Speaker 2>mish,</v>

131
00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:13.070
<v Speaker 2>so you can see that if we add a piece to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the end of the word,</v>

132
00:07:13.071 --> 00:07:13.904
<v Speaker 2>we're adding to the meaning of the word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This way of attaching suffixes to the </v>

133
00:07:16.881 --> 00:07:17.714
<v Speaker 2>end of a word is also used to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>plural forms possessive forums and to </v>

134
00:07:20.631 --> 00:07:21.464
<v Speaker 2>show grammatical case for announce.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's look at an example for the plural </v>

135
00:07:24.621 --> 00:07:25.300
<v Speaker 2>form</v>

136
00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:26.680
<v Speaker 3>bash,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bash,</v>

137
00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:27.910
<v Speaker 3>lad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>f,</v>

138
00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:29.043
<v Speaker 3>F,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lad.</v>

139
00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:32.200
<v Speaker 2>Let's look at another example with </v>
<v Speaker 2>possession this time,</v>

140
00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:34.770
<v Speaker 3>Taser,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Taser,</v>

141
00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:37.710
<v Speaker 3>Taser,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Taser,</v>

142
00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:38.573
<v Speaker 3>knees.</v>

143
00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:42.620
<v Speaker 2>Let's look at an example of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>grammatical cases in Turkish.</v>

144
00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:45.030
<v Speaker 2>There are six grammatical cases in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Turkish.</v>

145
00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:46.033
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't know what a grammatical </v>

146
00:07:46.821 --> 00:07:47.654
<v Speaker 2>case is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that means that the form of the noun </v>

147
00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.920
<v Speaker 2>changes depending on its function.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the sentence,</v>

148
00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:55.970
<v Speaker 2>the word we're using his tree arch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our June,</v>

149
00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:57.763
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible],</v>

150
00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.460
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible],</v>

151
00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] [inaudible].</v>

152
00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:04.513
<v Speaker 2>So you can see that the form of that now</v>
<v Speaker 2>changes depending on what function it </v>

153
00:08:07.341 --> 00:08:10.070
<v Speaker 2>fulfills in that sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how hard is Turkish to learn?</v>

154
00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:12.110
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that depends on your native language.</v>

155
00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:14.840
<v Speaker 2>If your native language is an a gluten </v>
<v Speaker 2>native language,</v>

156
00:08:14.841 --> 00:08:17.060
<v Speaker 2>or if you know another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a glutenous of language,</v>

157
00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:19.580
<v Speaker 2>then Turkish might seem more familiar to</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

158
00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:22.460
<v Speaker 2>But if you have never spoken a language </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that before,</v>

159
00:08:22.461 --> 00:08:25.070
<v Speaker 2>you might have to get used to a whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>new way of thinking.</v>

160
00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:25.963
<v Speaker 2>But the good news is that Turkish </v>
<v Speaker 2>grammar is very systematic and very </v>

161
00:08:28.611 --> 00:08:29.240
<v Speaker 2>consistent.</v>

162
00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:30.073
<v Speaker 2>And so was the writing system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Turkish is almost entirely a phonetic </v>

163
00:08:32.691 --> 00:08:33.524
<v Speaker 2>language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That means that for each sound there is </v>

164
00:08:34.971 --> 00:08:37.010
<v Speaker 2>one letter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you read a word,</v>

165
00:08:37.011 --> 00:08:39.770
<v Speaker 2>you know how to pronounce it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you know how to say a word,</v>

166
00:08:39.771 --> 00:08:41.510
<v Speaker 2>you know how to write it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as always,</v>

167
00:08:41.511 --> 00:08:43.670
<v Speaker 2>if you're deeply fascinated with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>culture,</v>

168
00:08:43.671 --> 00:08:44.504
<v Speaker 2>then it doesn't matter if the language </v>
<v Speaker 2>is challenging because you will be </v>

169
00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:47.263
<v Speaker 2>motivated enough to get past those </v>
<v Speaker 2>challenges and you'll enjoy it every </v>

170
00:08:50.271 --> 00:08:51.104
<v Speaker 2>step of the web.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you happen to be very interested </v>

171
00:08:53.241 --> 00:08:57.750
<v Speaker 2>in Turkey or in Azerbaijan or or other </v>
<v Speaker 2>places where a tricky is just spoken,</v>

172
00:08:57.751 --> 00:09:00.660
<v Speaker 2>then don't hesitate to start learning </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Turkish language.</v>

173
00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:02.670
<v Speaker 2>Thank you for watching the langue focus </v>
<v Speaker 2>channel.</v>

174
00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:06.510
<v Speaker 2>What should the question of the day be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't decide between a couple.</v>

175
00:09:06.511 --> 00:09:07.344
<v Speaker 2>So I'll give you two choices.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So people who speak Turkish or have </v>

176
00:09:09.421 --> 00:09:10.254
<v Speaker 2>studied Turkish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think that Azeri Turkish and </v>

177
00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:15.240
<v Speaker 2>Turkmen or the same language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dialects of the same language?</v>

178
00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:16.133
<v Speaker 2>How well do you understand each other?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And another question that I'm curious </v>

179
00:09:19.201 --> 00:09:20.034
<v Speaker 2>about Turkish people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you tried to read Ottoman Turkish </v>

180
00:09:22.681 --> 00:09:24.780
<v Speaker 2>from that period,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how well do you understand it?</v>

181
00:09:24.781 --> 00:09:25.614
<v Speaker 2>Are there too many loan words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>too much Persian and Arabic for you to </v>

182
00:09:27.781 --> 00:09:28.614
<v Speaker 2>understand more?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it close enough that you can </v>

183
00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:32.970
<v Speaker 2>understand it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let us know in the comments down below.</v>

184
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.020
<v Speaker 2>Everyone else comment as you wish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have a nice day.</v>

185
00:09:58.610 --> 00:09:59.443
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
