00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:03.660
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Lange focus channel.</v>

2
00:00:03.661 --> 00:00:05.670
<v Speaker 1>My name is Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for tuning in.</v>

3
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.680
<v Speaker 1>Today's topic is reactivating a language</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you haven't used in a long time.</v>

4
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.970
<v Speaker 1>A lot of colleague lights and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>language and fuzziest.</v>

5
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.990
<v Speaker 1>They'll say things like ice be 15 </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages or I speak 20 languages or you</v>

6
00:00:18.991 --> 00:00:21.540
<v Speaker 1>make your 30 or 40 or crazy numbers like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

7
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:22.553
<v Speaker 1>and that can be really intimidating </v>
<v Speaker 1>because most of us think I could never </v>

8
00:00:25.801 --> 00:00:28.190
<v Speaker 1>learn that many languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just a normal person.</v>

9
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't have that much talent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what most of those people are saying</v>

10
00:00:31.891 --> 00:00:36.210
<v Speaker 1>is that they have learned that many </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages well during their lifetime.</v>

11
00:00:36.211 --> 00:00:37.044
<v Speaker 1>They usually can't switch between all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those languages whenever they want </v>

12
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.513
<v Speaker 1>without taking some time to reactivate </v>
<v Speaker 1>the language and kind of get back into </v>

13
00:00:45.451 --> 00:00:46.284
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they kind of need some preparation </v>

14
00:00:47.401 --> 00:00:49.680
<v Speaker 1>time before they can speak that language</v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

15
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.873
<v Speaker 1>Now most people usually have some </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages that are kind of in the front </v>

16
00:00:53.371 --> 00:00:54.204
<v Speaker 1>of their brand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their active languages that can switch </v>

17
00:00:55.861 --> 00:00:56.694
<v Speaker 1>between them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's usually like three or </v>

18
00:00:58.291 --> 00:01:00.990
<v Speaker 1>four languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it depends on the person and how</v>

19
00:01:00.991 --> 00:01:02.820
<v Speaker 1>often they use all of those in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

20
00:01:02.821 --> 00:01:06.900
<v Speaker 1>But in my experience it's three or four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in my observation of other people,</v>

21
00:01:06.901 --> 00:01:11.040
<v Speaker 1>it seems to be three or four the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages aside from that kind of recede</v>

22
00:01:11.041 --> 00:01:13.500
<v Speaker 1>into the background and they'd become </v>
<v Speaker 1>dormant.</v>

23
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.950
<v Speaker 1>And in order to use those languages you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to reactivate them,</v>

24
00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.620
<v Speaker 1>get back into them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if somebody said to me right now,</v>

25
00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.620
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to Israel tomorrow,</v>

26
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.180
<v Speaker 1>you have to be able to speak Hebrew </v>
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow,</v>

27
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.140
<v Speaker 1>I would kind of panic because I haven't </v>
<v Speaker 1>spoken Hebrew in about 12 years.</v>

28
00:01:28.141 --> 00:01:28.974
<v Speaker 1>So it would take me a few days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would take me a week to take me a </v>

29
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:32.603
<v Speaker 1>couple of weeks to get back into Hebrew </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the point where I was confident </v>

30
00:01:35.191 --> 00:01:36.024
<v Speaker 1>speaking it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though I would say that 12 years </v>

31
00:01:37.591 --> 00:01:38.424
<v Speaker 1>ago I was conversationally fluent in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hebrew and I could read it pretty well </v>

32
00:01:41.521 --> 00:01:42.180
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

33
00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.930
<v Speaker 1>I would still need some time to refresh </v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

34
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:45.793
<v Speaker 1>my language skills and get back into </v>
<v Speaker 1>things because it's receded into the </v>

35
00:01:48.661 --> 00:01:51.510
<v Speaker 1>background for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how do you reactivate a language like</v>

36
00:01:51.511 --> 00:01:53.160
<v Speaker 1>that that's become dormant?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

37
00:01:53.161 --> 00:01:53.994
<v Speaker 1>you basically need to just dive right </v>
<v Speaker 1>back into it and see where your </v>

38
00:01:56.851 --> 00:01:59.550
<v Speaker 1>weaknesses lie and see what you can do </v>
<v Speaker 1>and see what you can to do.</v>

39
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:00.413
<v Speaker 1>And the best way to do that is by </v>
<v Speaker 1>interacting with someone and using the </v>

40
00:02:02.941 --> 00:02:04.950
<v Speaker 1>language communicatively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

41
00:02:04.951 --> 00:02:08.940
<v Speaker 1>recently I did that at work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I realized that one of my coworkers is a</v>

42
00:02:08.941 --> 00:02:09.774
<v Speaker 1>native Hebrew speaker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I tried having a conversation with </v>

43
00:02:12.151 --> 00:02:15.180
<v Speaker 1>him and Hebrew and I could do it kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

44
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.043
<v Speaker 1>but I realized that a lot of things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>slipped my mind and I wasn't nearly at </v>

45
00:02:19.441 --> 00:02:22.080
<v Speaker 1>the level that I was 12 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to be expected.</v>

46
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.913
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't surprised.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was actually surprised by how well I </v>

47
00:02:25.381 --> 00:02:28.800
<v Speaker 1>could speak Hebrew who had this point </v>
<v Speaker 1>after 12 years of dormancy.</v>

48
00:02:28.801 --> 00:02:31.380
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that experience was important because it</v>

49
00:02:31.381 --> 00:02:32.041
<v Speaker 1>showed me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

50
00:02:32.041 --> 00:02:35.040
<v Speaker 1>these are the things I'm forgetting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are the things that are not such a</v>

51
00:02:35.041 --> 00:02:37.740
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The things that are usually the first to</v>

52
00:02:37.741 --> 00:02:41.400
<v Speaker 1>slip and go away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the language becomes dormant is the</v>

53
00:02:41.401 --> 00:02:42.234
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vocabulary goes away really quickly and </v>

54
00:02:44.491 --> 00:02:46.980
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it's even really basic </v>
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary.</v>

55
00:02:46.981 --> 00:02:48.120
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things like apple,</v>

56
00:02:48.121 --> 00:02:48.954
<v Speaker 1>things like car words like sleep and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that often will just </v>

57
00:02:51.811 --> 00:02:52.644
<v Speaker 1>disappear from your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from your memory and it's in there </v>

58
00:02:54.901 --> 00:02:58.140
<v Speaker 1>passively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usually usually your passive skills will</v>

59
00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.240
<v Speaker 1>kind of remain intact and when you hear </v>
<v Speaker 1>those words you'll understand them,</v>

60
00:03:01.241 --> 00:03:03.550
<v Speaker 1>but when it's time to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they won't come up.</v>

61
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:04.593
<v Speaker 1>I would say that that's definitely true </v>
<v Speaker 1>for vocabulary and to some extent also </v>

62
00:03:07.961 --> 00:03:08.794
<v Speaker 1>for verb conjugations in my experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in my experience it's not that way </v>

63
00:03:12.791 --> 00:03:14.470
<v Speaker 1>for syntax or word order.</v>

64
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:15.483
<v Speaker 1>I don't really have any trouble building</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hebrew sentences or making sentences in </v>

65
00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:19.834
<v Speaker 1>the language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's mostly a problem of vocabulary and </v>

66
00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:22.834
<v Speaker 1>to some extent the verb conjugations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usually there's also a kind of lack of </v>

67
00:03:25.751 --> 00:03:28.660
<v Speaker 1>fluency and it takes you longer to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sentences out.</v>

68
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's a problem with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>grammar or sentence structure though.</v>

69
00:03:31.931 --> 00:03:32.764
<v Speaker 1>I think that's typically a problem with </v>
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary because you have these ideas </v>

70
00:03:36.251 --> 00:03:37.084
<v Speaker 1>you want to express,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't know how to bring up the </v>

71
00:03:39.701 --> 00:03:40.534
<v Speaker 1>words to express those ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you slow yourself down in order to </v>

72
00:03:43.331 --> 00:03:44.164
<v Speaker 1>retrieve those words and look for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary to express what you want to </v>

73
00:03:47.081 --> 00:03:49.690
<v Speaker 1>say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes you end up paraphrasing or</v>

74
00:03:49.691 --> 00:03:53.140
<v Speaker 1>explaining it in a different way and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that just slows down your fluency.</v>

75
00:03:53.141 --> 00:03:55.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's a problem with her </v>
<v Speaker 1>sentence structure.</v>

76
00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.953
<v Speaker 1>To me in my experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's usually something that sticks </v>

77
00:03:58.031 --> 00:03:58.864
<v Speaker 1>longterm.</v>

78
00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.853
<v Speaker 1>Now assuming that you learned the </v>
<v Speaker 1>language quite well the first time </v>

79
00:04:01.721 --> 00:04:02.554
<v Speaker 1>around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and by well I mean conversationally </v>

80
00:04:04.601 --> 00:04:05.434
<v Speaker 1>fluent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's basically a matter of </v>

81
00:04:06.761 --> 00:04:07.594
<v Speaker 1>refamiliarizing yourself with those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that you've forgotten so that </v>

82
00:04:10.391 --> 00:04:11.224
<v Speaker 1>they can become active instead of </v>
<v Speaker 1>passive so that you can use them </v>

83
00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:15.213
<v Speaker 1>productively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can speak using those elements and </v>

84
00:04:17.171 --> 00:04:18.004
<v Speaker 1>you can write using those elements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just understand them when you </v>

85
00:04:20.561 --> 00:04:21.394
<v Speaker 1>encountered them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sell the two steps of that are </v>

86
00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.823
<v Speaker 1>encountering those language elements </v>
<v Speaker 1>passively with books or with videos and </v>

87
00:04:27.311 --> 00:04:30.220
<v Speaker 1>audio and then giving yourself a chance </v>
<v Speaker 1>to use it.</v>

88
00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.113
<v Speaker 1>So I have some old Hebrew materials that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are used to use back in the day that I </v>

89
00:04:34.031 --> 00:04:34.864
<v Speaker 1>can use to refamiliarize myself </v>
<v Speaker 1>passively with some of these language </v>

90
00:04:38.621 --> 00:04:39.454
<v Speaker 1>elements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I have this one Hebrew in three </v>

91
00:04:40.601 --> 00:04:42.130
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This one I think is out of print,</v>

92
00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.310
<v Speaker 1>but I really liked these in three months</v>
<v Speaker 1>series by you go,</v>

93
00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.230
<v Speaker 1>they're all really good if you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>find them online.</v>

94
00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:48.363
<v Speaker 1>But this is the Hebrew one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me look at a sentence and just see </v>

95
00:04:50.711 --> 00:04:52.840
<v Speaker 1>if it reminds me of things that I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>forgotten.</v>

96
00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:54.253
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it says here on this page and Neil </v>

97
00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.830
<v Speaker 1>Patella hood's a nickel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a chef shunted sally flatwoods.</v>

98
00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.850
<v Speaker 1>Key.</v>
<v Speaker 1>O'Neil have Leo or backwards.</v>

99
00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:01.753
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that means he's talking about a </v>

100
00:05:02.861 --> 00:05:03.694
<v Speaker 1>marathon and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to run and I think I need to run </v>

101
00:05:07.511 --> 00:05:09.520
<v Speaker 1>because I love being outside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

102
00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.130
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably that's all familiar to me.</v>

103
00:05:12.131 --> 00:05:13.630
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't have forgotten any of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>words.</v>

104
00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:15.250
<v Speaker 1>The next sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

105
00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.330
<v Speaker 1>a of Albert holds up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We laid low [inaudible] the Shabbat.</v>

106
00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:20.350
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he says,</v>

107
00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:22.810
<v Speaker 1>but on the other hand when he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in any case,</v>

108
00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.840
<v Speaker 1>maybe I shouldn't because I had a cold </v>
<v Speaker 1>on Saturday,</v>

109
00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.560
<v Speaker 1>so the word [inaudible] which means in </v>
<v Speaker 1>any case,</v>

110
00:05:29.561 --> 00:05:32.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I would've remembered that</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless I saw it written right here.</v>

111
00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:33.693
<v Speaker 1>But now it's coming back to me just </v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing it once and also the word </v>

112
00:05:36.041 --> 00:05:37.750
<v Speaker 1>Nazella,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that means like a cold.</v>

113
00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.240
<v Speaker 1>I haven't thought of that word in 12 </v>
<v Speaker 1>plus years,</v>

114
00:05:40.241 --> 00:05:41.074
<v Speaker 1>so I wouldn't have been able to pull </v>
<v Speaker 1>that word up out of my memory and </v>

115
00:05:44.051 --> 00:05:45.820
<v Speaker 1>produce it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now that I've seen it,</v>

116
00:05:45.821 --> 00:05:48.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm starting to remember cases when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>used this word back in the day.</v>

117
00:05:48.941 --> 00:05:49.774
<v Speaker 1>So I think this is already being </v>
<v Speaker 1>refreshed in my memory and I'll be able </v>

118
00:05:53.471 --> 00:05:54.304
<v Speaker 1>to use those words in the near future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another book I used is this one </v>

119
00:05:58.191 --> 00:06:01.850
<v Speaker 1>mastering Hebrew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is actually one of the FSI books,</v>

120
00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:02.993
<v Speaker 1>the free public domain ones that you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>get for free on the Internet in pdf </v>

121
00:06:06.171 --> 00:06:08.720
<v Speaker 1>form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the Hebrew one's good.</v>

122
00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.330
<v Speaker 1>Let me look at something in this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>

123
00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.690
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he says there's a shot,</v>

124
00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.350
<v Speaker 1>a middleware,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ls there,</v>

125
00:06:16.351 --> 00:06:17.460
<v Speaker 1>Shiva,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Shiva is,</v>

126
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:18.790
<v Speaker 1>and look dumb again.</v>

127
00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:20.510
<v Speaker 1>And he'd say [inaudible] and they'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>have the book.</v>

128
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:22.790
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he says,</v>

129
00:06:22.791 --> 00:06:23.624
<v Speaker 1>at what time do you get up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other guy says around seven and </v>

130
00:06:26.661 --> 00:06:28.220
<v Speaker 1>the first guy says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's seven.</v>

131
00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:30.080
<v Speaker 1>That's early in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second guy says,</v>

132
00:06:30.081 --> 00:06:32.120
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to make breakfast for my family.</v>

133
00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:36.350
<v Speaker 1>So I'm most of those words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're still kind of familiar to mix.</v>

134
00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:38.780
<v Speaker 1>They're quite basic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the word mittal hour to get up,</v>

135
00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:40.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I would have been able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember that.</v>

136
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:43.610
<v Speaker 1>And now that I'm thinking about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>word,</v>

137
00:06:43.611 --> 00:06:44.444
<v Speaker 1>I'm remembering other related works like</v>
<v Speaker 1>shown malware shut on mail order that </v>

138
00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:50.930
<v Speaker 1>that's like an alarm clock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a clock that wakes you up.</v>

139
00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:55.610
<v Speaker 1>So I'm remembering related words and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of becoming like a web.</v>

140
00:06:55.611 --> 00:06:56.444
<v Speaker 1>Like I remember one word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I remember related words and other </v>

141
00:06:58.251 --> 00:06:59.084
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now I'm thinking of some sentences </v>

142
00:07:00.531 --> 00:07:02.750
<v Speaker 1>with that word that I made a long time </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>

143
00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:03.853
<v Speaker 1>So it all comes back when you just start</v>
<v Speaker 1>to refamiliarize yourself with some </v>

144
00:07:07.341 --> 00:07:08.174
<v Speaker 1>things that have become dormant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those are two textbooks that I've </v>

145
00:07:11.871 --> 00:07:12.704
<v Speaker 1>used in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also like to use phrase books like </v>

146
00:07:14.511 --> 00:07:15.344
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the lonely planet Hebrew phrase </v>

147
00:07:16.741 --> 00:07:18.020
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These ones are quite good.</v>

148
00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:19.610
<v Speaker 1>I like the lonely planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His books,</v>

149
00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:23.120
<v Speaker 1>they're good to just flip through and </v>
<v Speaker 1>just read simple sentences,</v>

150
00:07:23.121 --> 00:07:26.900
<v Speaker 1>read simple phrases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just review basic vocabulary because</v>

151
00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:29.720
<v Speaker 1>most of the vocabulary in here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his daily life vocabulary,</v>

152
00:07:29.721 --> 00:07:31.520
<v Speaker 1>it's quite practical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's good.</v>

153
00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:35.390
<v Speaker 1>It's a good way to just to get that core</v>
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary back into your,</v>

154
00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:39.440
<v Speaker 1>your active vocabulary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I just opened to a random page,</v>

155
00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:42.170
<v Speaker 1>let's see if I can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says,</v>

156
00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:43.240
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

157
00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:47.750
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you write this down please?</v>

158
00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:49.243
<v Speaker 1>A Little Sean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I would have remembered </v>

159
00:07:50.871 --> 00:07:53.840
<v Speaker 1>the word Leo Sharm without seeing it </v>
<v Speaker 1>right here.</v>

160
00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:54.630
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

161
00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:55.463
<v Speaker 1>I probably would have said like half </v>
<v Speaker 1>Shah [inaudible] is it possible to rate </v>

162
00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:00.943
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably would have said let's solve </v>

163
00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:04.100
<v Speaker 1>instead of real sean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you're writing something down,</v>

164
00:08:04.101 --> 00:08:06.320
<v Speaker 1>like on a list,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just show them is the better word to</v>

165
00:08:06.321 --> 00:08:08.000
<v Speaker 1>use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's good that aside here,</v>

166
00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:10.000
<v Speaker 1>another example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's see.</v>

167
00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:12.410
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] at the bank.</v>

168
00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:13.873
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

169
00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:16.520
<v Speaker 1>When do they open the bank?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When does the bank open?</v>

170
00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:17.503
<v Speaker 1>Probably those words are okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have remembered those materials </v>

171
00:08:19.761 --> 00:08:24.761
<v Speaker 1>when [inaudible] comes from pat </v>
<v Speaker 1>documents to open.</v>

172
00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.140
<v Speaker 1>So I would've remembered these words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

173
00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:32.400
<v Speaker 1>But let's see if Shar Lao viola guns </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] uh,</v>

174
00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:36.080
<v Speaker 1>can I transfer money here from my bank?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that one,</v>

175
00:08:36.081 --> 00:08:39.110
<v Speaker 1>I think I would've remembered most of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those words except Leah via,</v>

176
00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.920
<v Speaker 1>which is to transfer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

177
00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:41.983
<v Speaker 1>but now that I've seen it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm remembering a speech that they saw </v>

178
00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:49.310
<v Speaker 1>by Benjamin Netanyahu on tv like 12 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago where he said something like,</v>

179
00:08:49.311 --> 00:08:50.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

180
00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:51.750
<v Speaker 1>good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bye.</v>

181
00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:56.750
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] new [inaudible]. [inaudible]</v>

182
00:08:58.220 --> 00:08:59.140
<v Speaker 1>means like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

183
00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:00.143
<v Speaker 1>this is his Zionist philosophy you said </v>
<v Speaker 1>on there by bringing all the vast </v>

184
00:09:03.811 --> 00:09:06.720
<v Speaker 1>majority of Jews to Israel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can we fulfill the dream of Zionism?</v>

185
00:09:06.721 --> 00:09:07.554
<v Speaker 1>So she was saying bring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said they hired via ems to transfer </v>

186
00:09:10.261 --> 00:09:11.094
<v Speaker 1>them here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I just remembered that after seeing </v>

187
00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:15.870
<v Speaker 1>the word in this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this phrase book right now.</v>

188
00:09:15.871 --> 00:09:16.704
<v Speaker 1>So that's the kind of thing you can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just refamiliarize yourself with </v>

189
00:09:19.651 --> 00:09:20.484
<v Speaker 1>those language elements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you start to connect them with </v>

190
00:09:22.411 --> 00:09:24.990
<v Speaker 1>other elements that you've learned with </v>
<v Speaker 1>other situations.</v>

191
00:09:24.991 --> 00:09:25.824
<v Speaker 1>You've used the men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you start to get that snowball </v>

192
00:09:27.901 --> 00:09:29.760
<v Speaker 1>effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's one of the things you can do.</v>

193
00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:32.670
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in recent months with Hebrew,</v>

194
00:09:32.671 --> 00:09:35.790
<v Speaker 1>I've been watching some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some youtube videos in Hebrew.</v>

195
00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:37.260
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't planned.</v>

196
00:09:37.261 --> 00:09:40.560
<v Speaker 1>It was just that I stumbled upon some </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting videos.</v>

197
00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:42.840
<v Speaker 1>There were street interviews done partly</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Hebrew.</v>

198
00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:43.703
<v Speaker 1>So listening to the Hebrew passively </v>
<v Speaker 1>reminded me of some of those language </v>

199
00:09:46.921 --> 00:09:47.754
<v Speaker 1>elements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So remember it a lot of vocabulary and </v>

200
00:09:49.561 --> 00:09:51.870
<v Speaker 1>it improved my listening skills again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's,</v>

201
00:09:51.871 --> 00:09:52.704
<v Speaker 1>I'll just riff familiarization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also important to produce the </v>

202
00:09:55.621 --> 00:09:56.340
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

203
00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:57.173
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to take some Hebrew lessons</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get back into producing Hebrew </v>

204
00:10:01.081 --> 00:10:01.914
<v Speaker 1>verbally and we'll see how it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll probably just start practicing </v>

205
00:10:04.621 --> 00:10:07.470
<v Speaker 1>those elements that I've been reviewing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all of these books.</v>

206
00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:11.600
<v Speaker 1>But sit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

207
00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:16.920
<v Speaker 1>Num Sheer Laguna Bezalel Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd see lockers or legal claims.</v>

208
00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:20.010
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need any hot say,</v>

209
00:10:20.011 --> 00:10:24.800
<v Speaker 1>let's say l there's metal at the palm of</v>
<v Speaker 1>our last shelf money and this amount.</v>

210
00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:27.630
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>So basically in conclusion,</v>

211
00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:28.703
<v Speaker 1>I just want to say don't feel that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have some kind of pressure to learn to </v>

212
00:10:31.921 --> 00:10:32.754
<v Speaker 1>be fluent in multiple languages and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>always be able to speak them all the </v>

213
00:10:35.641 --> 00:10:36.474
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people who are language and </v>

214
00:10:37.701 --> 00:10:39.840
<v Speaker 1>fuzziest are polyglots there can't do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

215
00:10:39.841 --> 00:10:42.600
<v Speaker 1>They need to actually prioritize certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>

216
00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:45.030
<v Speaker 1>Those are usually the ones that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>currently using,</v>

217
00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:47.020
<v Speaker 1>the ones that are currently relevant to </v>
<v Speaker 1>their life.</v>

218
00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:49.440
<v Speaker 1>They're focused on using those ones and </v>
<v Speaker 1>keeping them active.</v>

219
00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:53.040
<v Speaker 1>And the other ones they have learned in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the past received them become dormant.</v>

220
00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:55.590
<v Speaker 1>But that's okay because if you ever need</v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

221
00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:56.603
<v Speaker 1>you just need a bit of notice and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can reactivate them by re </v>

222
00:10:59.381 --> 00:11:00.214
<v Speaker 1>familiarizing yourself with some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that have slipped out of your </v>

223
00:11:02.581 --> 00:11:03.414
<v Speaker 1>memory and then producing them so you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can get them back into your active </v>

224
00:11:07.141 --> 00:11:07.980
<v Speaker 1>language ability.</v>

225
00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:10.500
<v Speaker 1>So don't sweat it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't feel any kind of pressure.</v>

226
00:11:10.501 --> 00:11:13.860
<v Speaker 1>Don't take on some kind of ego identity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

227
00:11:13.861 --> 00:11:17.130
<v Speaker 1>I need to speak all these languages </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm a polyglot or whatever.</v>

228
00:11:17.131 --> 00:11:18.330
<v Speaker 1>It.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't do that to yourself.</v>

229
00:11:18.331 --> 00:11:20.730
<v Speaker 1>Just relax and have fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Enjoy the languages.</v>

230
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.500
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there will always be there.</v>

231
00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:24.900
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you've learned the </v>
<v Speaker 1>language quite well,</v>

232
00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:28.380
<v Speaker 1>then it will always be there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just need to re activate it,</v>

233
00:11:28.381 --> 00:11:30.240
<v Speaker 1>so don't even worry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

234
00:11:30.241 --> 00:11:31.650
<v Speaker 1>this is Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for watching.</v>

235
00:11:31.651 --> 00:11:34.350
<v Speaker 1>Have a good nights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're an infant,</v>

236
00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:35.513
<v Speaker 1>you spend about a year just sitting </v>
<v Speaker 1>there listening to the language before </v>

237
00:11:38.281 --> 00:11:40.920
<v Speaker 1>you actually see anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just absorbing the salads.</v>

238
00:11:40.921 --> 00:11:41.754
<v Speaker 1>You're internalizing the phonology </v>
<v Speaker 1>before you actually produce it as an </v>

239
00:11:44.851 --> 00:11:47.070
<v Speaker 1>adult that you have a year to sit around</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing that.</v>

240
00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:48.143
<v Speaker 1>I know I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I've been talking about focusing the </v>

241
00:11:49.681 --> 00:11:50.514
<v Speaker 1>grand sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in terms of your large goals and </v>

242
00:11:52.501 --> 00:11:53.334
<v Speaker 1>that kind of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but of course the focus is also </v>

243
00:11:54.721 --> 00:11:58.770
<v Speaker 1>important in the moment because we live </v>
<v Speaker 1>in such a distraction prong world.</v>
