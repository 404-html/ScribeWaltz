00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:09.163
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and </v>

4
00:00:11.001 --> 00:00:14.570
<v Speaker 1>my name is Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today's topic is the Celtic languages.</v>

5
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:15.793
<v Speaker 1>Celtic languages are today spoken mainly</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the British isles where they've </v>

6
00:00:18.441 --> 00:00:21.110
<v Speaker 1>existed alongside English since the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Middle Ages.</v>

7
00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:22.693
<v Speaker 1>The numbers are not exactly clear </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the Celtic languages have gone </v>

8
00:00:25.251 --> 00:00:28.940
<v Speaker 1>through declines and revivals and people</v>
<v Speaker 1>have varying degrees of ability,</v>

9
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:30.980
<v Speaker 1>so we'll take these numbers with a grain</v>
<v Speaker 1>of salt,</v>

10
00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.910
<v Speaker 1>but there are around a million speakers </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Celtic languages in total.</v>

11
00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:40.330
<v Speaker 1>That includes Welsh with around 508,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>speakers and around 310,000</v>

12
00:00:40.941 --> 00:00:41.774
<v Speaker 1>fluent speakers mainly in Wales.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there's Irish Gaelic which has </v>

13
00:00:45.831 --> 00:00:46.664
<v Speaker 1>around 80,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>proficient speakers who use it outside </v>

14
00:00:48.681 --> 00:00:49.514
<v Speaker 1>of school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but around 2 million people have at </v>

15
00:00:50.871 --> 00:00:51.704
<v Speaker 1>least some knowledge of it mainly in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ireland and to some extent in Northern </v>

16
00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:55.663
<v Speaker 1>Ireland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they're Scottish Gaelic which has </v>

17
00:00:57.081 --> 00:01:00.680
<v Speaker 1>around 57,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>native speakers and around 87,000</v>

18
00:01:00.681 --> 00:01:03.560
<v Speaker 1>people with some knowledge of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>language mainly in Scotland.</v>

19
00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.730
<v Speaker 1>There is also a small Scottish Gaelic </v>
<v Speaker 1>community of around 2,300</v>

20
00:01:07.731 --> 00:01:10.400
<v Speaker 1>people in Cape Breton Nova Scotia in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada.</v>

21
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.260
<v Speaker 1>Then there's the Breton language spoken </v>
<v Speaker 1>by around 226,000</v>

22
00:01:15.261 --> 00:01:17.750
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mainly in the Brittany region of France,</v>

23
00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.400
<v Speaker 1>that figure of 226,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>include students in bilingual schools.</v>

24
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.190
<v Speaker 1>Then there's the cornish language spoken</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Cornwall,</v>

25
00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.010
<v Speaker 1>which came close to extinction in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>19th century,</v>

26
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.873
<v Speaker 1>but has undergone a revival and now has </v>
<v Speaker 1>a few thousand fluent speakers and then </v>

27
00:01:33.171 --> 00:01:35.690
<v Speaker 1>there's the manx language spoken on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Isle of Man,</v>

28
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:36.553
<v Speaker 1>which has only around a hundred native </v>
<v Speaker 1>speakers and a couple thousand people </v>

29
00:01:39.171 --> 00:01:40.004
<v Speaker 1>who can speak some makes today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not spoken by a very large </v>

30
00:01:42.801 --> 00:01:43.634
<v Speaker 1>number of people and they're mostly </v>
<v Speaker 1>limited to the British isles and to </v>

31
00:01:45.951 --> 00:01:46.784
<v Speaker 1>Brittany in France,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but historically the Celtic languages </v>

32
00:01:48.861 --> 00:01:51.980
<v Speaker 1>were spoken over a much larger area than</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are today.</v>

33
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:53.263
<v Speaker 1>During the first millennium bce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were spoken across much of Europe </v>

34
00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.863
<v Speaker 1>from the Iberian Peninsula all the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>over to the Black Sea and even in parts </v>

35
00:01:59.961 --> 00:02:00.830
<v Speaker 1>of Asia Minor.</v>

36
00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:01.723
<v Speaker 1>One probable Prodo Celtic culture was </v>
<v Speaker 1>the earned field culture of central </v>

37
00:02:04.971 --> 00:02:08.570
<v Speaker 1>Europe in the late Bronze Age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a flourishing culture from around</v>

38
00:02:08.571 --> 00:02:09.404
<v Speaker 1>1200 bce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's language was at least likely an </v>

39
00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.380
<v Speaker 1>early form of Celtic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if not protocol t,</v>

40
00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.180
<v Speaker 1>and we think so partly based on place </v>
<v Speaker 1>name evidence,</v>

41
00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:18.223
<v Speaker 1>protal Celtic developed into various </v>
<v Speaker 1>Celtic languages which were spoken over </v>

42
00:02:21.111 --> 00:02:21.944
<v Speaker 1>a wide area in Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The earliest attested tested Celtic </v>

43
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.880
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The pontic language,</v>

44
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.930
<v Speaker 1>the language of the goal of culture that</v>
<v Speaker 1>descended from the earned field culture.</v>

45
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.853
<v Speaker 1>There are about 140 the pontic </v>
<v Speaker 1>inscriptions that were discovered in </v>

46
00:02:33.801 --> 00:02:34.634
<v Speaker 1>northern Italy and southern Switzerland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These inscriptions date from around 550 </v>

47
00:02:38.421 --> 00:02:39.254
<v Speaker 1>bce to 100 bce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The gullah culture had strong </v>

48
00:02:42.321 --> 00:02:44.810
<v Speaker 1>connections with the neighboring house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That culture,</v>

49
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.800
<v Speaker 1>the major celtic culture at that time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these languages on the European mainland</v>

50
00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:49.663
<v Speaker 1>and in Asia Minor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll refer to as the continental </v>

51
00:02:51.621 --> 00:02:52.454
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>

52
00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.220
<v Speaker 1>This is a geographic grouping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a linguistic one,</v>

53
00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.083
<v Speaker 1>and there are no particular linguistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>innovations that would make them a </v>

54
00:02:58.461 --> 00:02:59.294
<v Speaker 1>linguistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here are some continental Celtic </v>

55
00:03:00.971 --> 00:03:01.804
<v Speaker 1>languages that might ring a bell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the goldfish language spoken in </v>

56
00:03:04.401 --> 00:03:05.234
<v Speaker 1>dl within Presente de France and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Galician spoken in Asia minor around </v>

57
00:03:09.791 --> 00:03:10.750
<v Speaker 1>present day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ankara,</v>

58
00:03:10.751 --> 00:03:14.170
<v Speaker 1>Turkey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The continental Celtic languages are all</v>

59
00:03:14.171 --> 00:03:15.004
<v Speaker 1>extinct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Celtic speakers began to die out or </v>

60
00:03:16.901 --> 00:03:17.734
<v Speaker 1>become assimilated into the Roman </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture by around 200 bce before the </v>

61
00:03:21.821 --> 00:03:24.400
<v Speaker 1>death and assimilation of Celtic </v>
<v Speaker 1>speakers on the mainland,</v>

62
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.040
<v Speaker 1>some Celtic speakers migrated to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>British isles.</v>

63
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.933
<v Speaker 1>The Celtic languages that developed in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the British isles are known as the </v>

64
00:03:30.251 --> 00:03:31.084
<v Speaker 1>insular Celtic languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The insular Celtic languages are still </v>

65
00:03:33.731 --> 00:03:34.564
<v Speaker 1>alive today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are two groups of insular Celtic </v>

66
00:03:36.311 --> 00:03:39.250
<v Speaker 1>languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cute Celtic or Goy Delek languages which</v>

67
00:03:39.251 --> 00:03:40.750
<v Speaker 1>include Irish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scottish,</v>

68
00:03:40.751 --> 00:03:45.751
<v Speaker 1>and makes Gaelic and the PA Celtic or </v>
<v Speaker 1>nick languages which include Breton,</v>

69
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.200
<v Speaker 1>cornish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Welsh.</v>

70
00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.130
<v Speaker 1>These two groups of insular Celtic </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages are not intelligible with each</v>

71
00:03:51.131 --> 00:03:51.964
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but within each group there is some </v>

72
00:03:53.021 --> 00:03:56.140
<v Speaker 1>degree of intelligibility depending on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the dialect being spoken.</v>

73
00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:57.333
<v Speaker 1>The two groups of insular Celtic </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages evolved from a common </v>

74
00:03:59.741 --> 00:04:03.070
<v Speaker 1>ancestor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The oldest known insular Celtic language</v>

75
00:04:03.071 --> 00:04:06.880
<v Speaker 1>is a form of Archaic Irish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes called Primitive Irish.</v>

76
00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.893
<v Speaker 1>It is found in the argument scriptions </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the early fourth century CE </v>

77
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.690
<v Speaker 1>organism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an alphabet that was used to write Irish</v>

78
00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.100
<v Speaker 1>as a group from primitive Irish into old</v>
<v Speaker 1>Irish and was used until about the ninth</v>

79
00:04:18.101 --> 00:04:18.934
<v Speaker 1>century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Old Irish eventually developed into the </v>

80
00:04:20.921 --> 00:04:21.754
<v Speaker 1>modern Irish Gaelic up today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Speakers of old Irish also migrated to </v>

81
00:04:25.781 --> 00:04:26.614
<v Speaker 1>Scotland where it eventually developed </v>
<v Speaker 1>into Scottish Gaelic and to the Isle of </v>

82
00:04:30.761 --> 00:04:34.660
<v Speaker 1>man where it evolved into banks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While primitive Irish,</v>

83
00:04:34.661 --> 00:04:37.320
<v Speaker 1>a rosen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ireland common [inaudible] Rosen,</v>

84
00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.360
<v Speaker 1>Great Britain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Common Bottleneck is the ancestor of all</v>

85
00:04:40.361 --> 00:04:42.640
<v Speaker 1>the PA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Celtic or [inaudible] languages.</v>

86
00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:43.803
<v Speaker 1>The pick dish language which went </v>
<v Speaker 1>extinct by the twelfth century Ce may </v>

87
00:04:46.901 --> 00:04:47.734
<v Speaker 1>have been a sonic language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's possible that pick dish was </v>

88
00:04:49.991 --> 00:04:52.390
<v Speaker 1>related to sonic but not descended from </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

89
00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.410
<v Speaker 1>Over the course of a few centuries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>protonic dialects evolved into Welsh,</v>

90
00:04:56.411 --> 00:04:57.640
<v Speaker 1>cornish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Breton,</v>

91
00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:59.560
<v Speaker 1>and come brick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is extinct.</v>

92
00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.040
<v Speaker 1>The Celtic languages were under great </v>
<v Speaker 1>pressure during this time.</v>

93
00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.110
<v Speaker 1>Breton is in fact spoken in continental </v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe in the Brittany region of France,</v>

94
00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.120
<v Speaker 1>even though it's an insular Celtic </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

95
00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:13.330
<v Speaker 1>It has been spoken there since the sixth</v>
<v Speaker 1>century CE,</v>

96
00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:17.260
<v Speaker 1>when some Celtic speakers fled during </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Anglo Saxon invasion of Britain.</v>

97
00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:19.053
<v Speaker 1>Coexistence with English Britain was </v>
<v Speaker 1>ruled by the Romans from 43 Ce to 410 </v>

98
00:05:23.861 --> 00:05:26.290
<v Speaker 1>seat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but after the departure of the Romans,</v>

99
00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.630
<v Speaker 1>the Anglo saxons began to invade </v>
<v Speaker 1>Britain.</v>

100
00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.823
<v Speaker 1>In Britain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Anglo saxons conquered the Celtic </v>

101
00:05:31.421 --> 00:05:34.300
<v Speaker 1>peoples and either eliminated them or </v>
<v Speaker 1>intermarried with them,</v>

102
00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:35.163
<v Speaker 1>depending on the source,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you consult eventually replacing the </v>

103
00:05:37.121 --> 00:05:40.660
<v Speaker 1>Celtic languages with old English,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not in Wales and Cornwall,</v>

104
00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:43.330
<v Speaker 1>which remained Celtic in Scotland.</v>

105
00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:47.470
<v Speaker 1>Gaelic speakers from Ireland migrated to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the west coast around the same time that</v>

106
00:05:47.471 --> 00:05:52.471
<v Speaker 1>Anglo saxons migrated to the east coast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then Scottish Gaelic began to develop in</v>

107
00:05:52.721 --> 00:05:53.554
<v Speaker 1>Scotland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gaelic coexisted with the old English </v>

108
00:05:55.511 --> 00:05:59.060
<v Speaker 1>dialects that would later develop into </v>
<v Speaker 1>Scotts and Scotts English,</v>

109
00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.930
<v Speaker 1>and in the year 17 or seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scotland formed a union with England and</v>

110
00:06:02.931 --> 00:06:04.760
<v Speaker 1>Wales,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Kingdom of Great Britain.</v>

111
00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:05.893
<v Speaker 1>After that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scottish Gaelic began to diminish and </v>

112
00:06:07.671 --> 00:06:11.030
<v Speaker 1>use partly because English was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>language of universal education.</v>

113
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:16.330
<v Speaker 1>Scottish Gaelic is today considered </v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely endangered by UNESCO as World</v>

114
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:19.790
<v Speaker 1>Language Project Wales came under the </v>
<v Speaker 1>control of England in the year 12,</v>

115
00:06:19.791 --> 00:06:20.624
<v Speaker 1>82.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welsh has continued to be spoken until </v>

116
00:06:22.581 --> 00:06:24.440
<v Speaker 1>the present day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for a long time.</v>

117
00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:25.303
<v Speaker 1>English was given preference as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>official language and in the 19th and </v>

118
00:06:28.161 --> 00:06:28.994
<v Speaker 1>20th centuries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welsh declined rapidly in favor of </v>

119
00:06:31.281 --> 00:06:32.114
<v Speaker 1>English,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but efforts have been made to conserve </v>

120
00:06:33.711 --> 00:06:34.544
<v Speaker 1>the Welsh language and everybody learns </v>
<v Speaker 1>at least some of it in school and some </v>

121
00:06:37.551 --> 00:06:40.370
<v Speaker 1>people take their entire public school </v>
<v Speaker 1>education in Welsh,</v>

122
00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:41.353
<v Speaker 1>and as I mentioned before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it currently has hundreds of thousands </v>

123
00:06:43.341 --> 00:06:44.270
<v Speaker 1>of native speakers.</v>

124
00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:47.600
<v Speaker 1>Cornwall was under English control by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mid 19th century.</v>

125
00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:51.950
<v Speaker 1>Their language began to disappear after </v>
<v Speaker 1>England passed the act of uniformity and</v>

126
00:06:51.951 --> 00:06:52.970
<v Speaker 1>15,</v>
<v Speaker 1>58.</v>

127
00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:56.750
<v Speaker 1>This was a law that made English the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sole language of church services.</v>

128
00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:57.643
<v Speaker 1>The cornish language almost became </v>
<v Speaker 1>extinct and it was actually a </v>

129
00:07:00.001 --> 00:07:00.834
<v Speaker 1>temporarily declared extinct by UNESCO,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a revival movement in the 20th </v>

130
00:07:04.731 --> 00:07:05.564
<v Speaker 1>century has given new life to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>language and it is now taught in some </v>

131
00:07:08.031 --> 00:07:08.864
<v Speaker 1>schools and there are now about 300 </v>
<v Speaker 1>fluent cornish speakers on the isle of </v>

132
00:07:12.321 --> 00:07:13.154
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The manx language is in a similar </v>

133
00:07:14.331 --> 00:07:16.490
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It almost became extinct,</v>

134
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:17.383
<v Speaker 1>but a revival movement has resulted in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>few hundred fluent speakers of the </v>

135
00:07:20.271 --> 00:07:21.104
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is also a manx language primary </v>

136
00:07:22.851 --> 00:07:23.684
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're creating a new generation of </v>

137
00:07:24.861 --> 00:07:25.694
<v Speaker 1>make speakers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ireland became an English colony from </v>

138
00:07:27.711 --> 00:07:28.544
<v Speaker 1>1169 to 1949.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Irish remained the majority language </v>

139
00:07:32.151 --> 00:07:35.420
<v Speaker 1>there until the 19th century when it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>overtaken by English.</v>

140
00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:39.170
<v Speaker 1>Despite strong intentions to support and</v>
<v Speaker 1>revive the Irish language,</v>

141
00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.660
<v Speaker 1>it continues to decline in favor of </v>
<v Speaker 1>English.</v>

142
00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:42.523
<v Speaker 1>It is taught in schools,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not many people use the language of </v>

143
00:07:44.751 --> 00:07:48.320
<v Speaker 1>their own volition outside of schools </v>
<v Speaker 1>and similar to Scottish Gaelic,</v>

144
00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:49.173
<v Speaker 1>it is considered definitely endangered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Brittany region became part of </v>

145
00:07:53.751 --> 00:07:56.570
<v Speaker 1>France in the 16th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In France.</v>

146
00:07:56.571 --> 00:07:59.630
<v Speaker 1>There is no official recognition of any </v>
<v Speaker 1>regional languages.</v>

147
00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:00.673
<v Speaker 1>The majority of Breton speakers today </v>
<v Speaker 1>are in their sixties or older and the </v>

148
00:08:03.711 --> 00:08:06.270
<v Speaker 1>number of speakers could be dropping by </v>
<v Speaker 1>$10,000</v>

149
00:08:06.271 --> 00:08:07.104
<v Speaker 1>per year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is considered severely endangered by </v>

150
00:08:09.051 --> 00:08:09.884
<v Speaker 1>UNESCO.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now let's look at some features of </v>

151
00:08:12.261 --> 00:08:16.220
<v Speaker 1>Celtic languages in general.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Celtic languages feature vsl,</v>

152
00:08:16.221 --> 00:08:17.054
<v Speaker 1>word order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually Continental Celtic languages </v>

153
00:08:18.951 --> 00:08:19.784
<v Speaker 1>probably had freer word order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's focus on the Living Celtic </v>

154
00:08:22.551 --> 00:08:25.010
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's an example of vsl word order.</v>

155
00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:25.873
<v Speaker 1>In Irish Gaelic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This sentence means I saw the man this </v>

156
00:08:28.131 --> 00:08:31.580
<v Speaker 1>morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Honickman farrier margin word for word.</v>

157
00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:36.170
<v Speaker 1>It's see past tense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I the man on morning.</v>

158
00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:38.210
<v Speaker 1>You can see that it's vs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

159
00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:39.133
<v Speaker 1>another sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This one means the man was painting a </v>

160
00:08:41.061 --> 00:08:41.894
<v Speaker 1>chair yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He and Ferric Pancho cohere in a word </v>

161
00:08:45.111 --> 00:08:47.420
<v Speaker 1>for word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's be in past tense.</v>

162
00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:51.770
<v Speaker 1>The man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>progressive paint chair yesterday.</v>

163
00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:52.783
<v Speaker 1>You can see that it's vsl with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>auxiliary verb coming in first position </v>

164
00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:58.890
<v Speaker 1>and the main lexical verb coming after </v>
<v Speaker 1>the subject,</v>

165
00:08:58.980 --> 00:08:59.813
<v Speaker 1>and then there's the object next Celtic </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages feature inflected </v>

166
00:09:03.661 --> 00:09:04.494
<v Speaker 1>prepositions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are basically a combination of a </v>

167
00:09:06.331 --> 00:09:10.350
<v Speaker 1>preposition and a personal pronoun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at an example from Welsh.</v>

168
00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:11.423
<v Speaker 1>The preposition meaning on his ad and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the stem that comes before inflections </v>

169
00:09:15.601 --> 00:09:20.601
<v Speaker 1>is at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we have on me out of notch on us,</v>

170
00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:25.440
<v Speaker 1>on you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>singular on you,</v>

171
00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:28.020
<v Speaker 1>plural,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on him,</v>

172
00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:32.460
<v Speaker 1>on her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of in on them,</v>

173
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:33.833
<v Speaker 1>out of a similar kind of inflected </v>
<v Speaker 1>preposition exists in Semitic languages </v>

174
00:09:38.491 --> 00:09:39.690
<v Speaker 1>like Hebrew and Arabic.</v>

175
00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:43.590
<v Speaker 1>Next Celtic languages feature initial </v>
<v Speaker 1>consonant mutations.</v>

176
00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:46.530
<v Speaker 1>That is a change in the consonant at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning of a word,</v>

177
00:09:46.531 --> 00:09:48.900
<v Speaker 1>depending on its context.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

178
00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:52.500
<v Speaker 1>if the word is preceded by a definite </v>
<v Speaker 1>article in the genitive case,</v>

179
00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:57.180
<v Speaker 1>let's take a look at this in Irish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we have the word for men fair,</v>

180
00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:58.433
<v Speaker 1>but if we want to say of the men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it becomes unfair and it's similar for </v>

181
00:10:03.001 --> 00:10:05.460
<v Speaker 1>the date of case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we want to say to the men,</v>

182
00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:10.520
<v Speaker 1>it becomes to unfair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the unfair.</v>

183
00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:14.430
<v Speaker 1>It may be hard to hear a difference in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that continent,</v>

184
00:10:14.431 --> 00:10:17.850
<v Speaker 1>but there is a sort of softening of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>f sound in some dialects.</v>

185
00:10:17.851 --> 00:10:21.750
<v Speaker 1>That mutated consonant sounds something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a v sound in other dialects.</v>

186
00:10:21.751 --> 00:10:26.310
<v Speaker 1>It's silent not only continent </v>
<v Speaker 1>mutations,</v>

187
00:10:26.311 --> 00:10:30.810
<v Speaker 1>but also vowel mutations occur in Celtic</v>
<v Speaker 1>languages as a morphological device.</v>

188
00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:31.733
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at some examples from Welsh </v>
<v Speaker 1>that will mutations can be used in </v>

189
00:10:34.831 --> 00:10:35.664
<v Speaker 1>forming different parts of speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes a sold the noun hio meaning son </v>

190
00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.410
<v Speaker 1>becomes the adjective.</v>

191
00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:44.220
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

192
00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:45.053
<v Speaker 1>meaning Sunny Vale mutations can also be</v>
<v Speaker 1>used in the formation of a plural who </v>

193
00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:54.410
<v Speaker 1>becomes a so the singular noun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cool meaning boat becomes God,</v>

194
00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:58.200
<v Speaker 1>meaning boats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Celtic languages,</v>

195
00:10:58.201 --> 00:11:02.760
<v Speaker 1>also feature and impersonal verb form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>serving as a passive or in transitive.</v>

196
00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:04.043
<v Speaker 1>An example from Welsh discussion means I</v>
<v Speaker 1>teach the scared means is taught or one </v>

197
00:11:11.191 --> 00:11:12.024
<v Speaker 1>teaches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is an impersonal verb that is not </v>

198
00:11:13.921 --> 00:11:17.720
<v Speaker 1>conjugated for person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>An example from Irish Munoz,</v>

199
00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:20.730
<v Speaker 1>I teach moon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cer is taught,</v>

200
00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:21.713
<v Speaker 1>one teaches in English.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no specific verb form </v>

201
00:11:24.081 --> 00:11:24.914
<v Speaker 1>dedicated to the passive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to use an auxiliary verb plus </v>

202
00:11:27.391 --> 00:11:30.300
<v Speaker 1>the past participle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has some other functions as well.</v>

203
00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:34.050
<v Speaker 1>Differences between the PA Celtic </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages and the q Celtic languages.</v>

204
00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:37.560
<v Speaker 1>These two groups of languages have had </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of years to divert,</v>

205
00:11:37.561 --> 00:11:38.394
<v Speaker 1>so there are a lot more differences </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the two branches than there are </v>

206
00:11:40.861 --> 00:11:41.694
<v Speaker 1>between the languages within them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are a lot of cognate words shared </v>

207
00:11:44.701 --> 00:11:45.534
<v Speaker 1>between the two groups of languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you could say that they are distant </v>

208
00:11:48.001 --> 00:11:48.834
<v Speaker 1>cognates because sound changes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>spelling changes have made the words </v>

209
00:11:51.631 --> 00:11:52.650
<v Speaker 1>unrecognizable.</v>

210
00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:54.280
<v Speaker 1>In many cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the labels,</v>

211
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:55.143
<v Speaker 1>PA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Celtic and q Celtic reflect the way </v>

212
00:11:56.561 --> 00:11:58.810
<v Speaker 1>these two groups developed from Provo </v>
<v Speaker 1>Celtic.</v>

213
00:11:59.020 --> 00:11:59.853
<v Speaker 1>If we look at the cognates that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>shared between both branches in the PA </v>

214
00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:05.140
<v Speaker 1>Celtic branch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are words that commonly begin with</v>

215
00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:06.430
<v Speaker 1>P or b.</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

216
00:12:06.431 --> 00:12:10.030
<v Speaker 1>in the queue Celtic branch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they begin with C or k or q.</v>

217
00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:12.700
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The word for what in Irish,</v>

218
00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:13.563
<v Speaker 1>it's Cain and in Welsh it's bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are some other common sound </v>

219
00:12:17.381 --> 00:12:18.970
<v Speaker 1>differences too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

220
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:21.550
<v Speaker 1>words beginning with s followed by e or </v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

221
00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:22.473
<v Speaker 1>which make a shift sound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the Delek languages often begin with </v>

222
00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:26.373
<v Speaker 1>h in the languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the word for old in Irish is Shan </v>

223
00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:31.473
<v Speaker 1>ended Welsh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's and despite their coexistence with </v>

224
00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:36.243
<v Speaker 1>English over the centuries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Celtic languages are very distinct </v>

225
00:12:38.891 --> 00:12:39.724
<v Speaker 1>from English and they're an important </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the history and the culture and </v>

226
00:12:42.251 --> 00:12:46.600
<v Speaker 1>identity of the United Kingdom and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ireland as well as Brittany in France,</v>

227
00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:51.310
<v Speaker 1>but today most of the Celtic languages </v>
<v Speaker 1>are considered to be endangered with the</v>

228
00:12:51.311 --> 00:12:52.144
<v Speaker 1>English language and French dominating </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether the Celtic languages survive or </v>

229
00:12:55.361 --> 00:12:57.400
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depends on the communities to which they</v>

230
