<v Speaker 2>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lang focus channel or your up.</v>

3
00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:10.810
<v Speaker 2>I want to talk about something called </v>
<v Speaker 2>code switching.</v>

4
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.280
<v Speaker 2>Gang goal cutie pie article.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Though</v>

5
00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.830
<v Speaker 2>some people are monolingual and speak </v>
<v Speaker 2>just one language.</v>

6
00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:19.723
<v Speaker 2>Other people are bilingual or </v>
<v Speaker 2>multilingual and speak more than one </v>

7
00:00:22.371 --> 00:00:23.204
<v Speaker 2>language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bilingual or multilingual people </v>

8
00:00:24.801 --> 00:00:28.400
<v Speaker 2>sometimes switch back and forth between </v>
<v Speaker 2>two or more different languages.</v>

9
00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.600
<v Speaker 2>This is called code switching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One situation in which code switching is</v>

10
00:00:32.601 --> 00:00:35.180
<v Speaker 2>common is within immigrant families.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

11
00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.260
<v Speaker 2>let's imagine a Russian family moves </v>
<v Speaker 2>from Russia to the United States and the</v>

12
00:00:39.261 --> 00:00:42.020
<v Speaker 2>children grow up speaking Russian as </v>
<v Speaker 2>their native language,</v>

13
00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.390
<v Speaker 2>but they learned English outside of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>home.</v>

14
00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.210
<v Speaker 2>When the children in that family speak </v>
<v Speaker 2>to their siblings,</v>

15
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.700
<v Speaker 2>they might code switch between Russian </v>
<v Speaker 2>and English.</v>

16
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:50.953
<v Speaker 2>Another situation in which code </v>
<v Speaker 2>switching is common is in certain </v>

17
00:00:53.571 --> 00:00:54.404
<v Speaker 2>countries where a native language is </v>
<v Speaker 2>spoken alongside a former colonial </v>

18
00:00:57.501 --> 00:00:58.334
<v Speaker 2>language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One example that comes to mind is in </v>

19
00:00:59.841 --> 00:01:00.674
<v Speaker 2>India where Hindi English code switching</v>
<v Speaker 2>is Coleman and another example is in </v>

20
00:01:04.011 --> 00:01:06.830
<v Speaker 2>Philippines where Tagalog English code </v>
<v Speaker 2>switching is Coleman.</v>

21
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.590
<v Speaker 2>You may have seen my earlier video on </v>
<v Speaker 2>die glossier,</v>

22
00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:10.453
<v Speaker 2>which means switching between two </v>
<v Speaker 2>different languages or two different </v>

23
00:01:12.921 --> 00:01:15.590
<v Speaker 2>forms of a language in different </v>
<v Speaker 2>situations.</v>

24
00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.440
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>formal versus informal situations.</v>

25
00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:19.363
<v Speaker 2>Code switching is different in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people switch languages in a single </v>

26
00:01:22.011 --> 00:01:26.180
<v Speaker 2>situation within a single conversation </v>
<v Speaker 2>and sometimes within a single sentence.</v>

27
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:27.283
<v Speaker 2>Code switching is largely unpredictable </v>
<v Speaker 2>and speakers often impulsively switch </v>

28
00:01:30.891 --> 00:01:31.724
<v Speaker 2>languages without any conscious choice </v>
<v Speaker 2>in code switching one language is the </v>

29
00:01:35.271 --> 00:01:36.104
<v Speaker 2>dominant language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Normally the native language of the </v>

30
00:01:37.821 --> 00:01:38.654
<v Speaker 2>group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is sometimes called the Matrix </v>

31
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.610
<v Speaker 2>language and the additional language is </v>
<v Speaker 2>called the embedded language.</v>

32
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.133
<v Speaker 2>The Matrix language lays out the basis </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the communication and then </v>

33
00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.770
<v Speaker 2>utterances from the additional language </v>
<v Speaker 2>are embedded into the matrix language.</v>

34
00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:52.783
<v Speaker 2>There were various reasons that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>might switch from their matrix language </v>

35
00:01:55.311 --> 00:01:57.320
<v Speaker 2>to an embedded language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Number one,</v>

36
00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.183
<v Speaker 2>directive function.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People switch languages to either </v>

37
00:02:00.351 --> 00:02:03.260
<v Speaker 2>include or exclude other people from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation.</v>

38
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.273
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you want to tell secrets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you switched to a language that the </v>

39
00:02:06.651 --> 00:02:09.230
<v Speaker 2>people around you don't understand or </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe the opposite.</v>

40
00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:10.093
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you want to end a private </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation and reengage with the </v>

41
00:02:12.681 --> 00:02:13.514
<v Speaker 2>people around you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you switched to a language that they </v>

42
00:02:14.901 --> 00:02:16.280
<v Speaker 2>do understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Number two,</v>

43
00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.143
<v Speaker 2>expressive function.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People include the embedded language in </v>

44
00:02:19.401 --> 00:02:21.560
<v Speaker 2>order to express some part of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>identity.</v>

45
00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:22.723
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to show their connection to a </v>

46
00:02:24.051 --> 00:02:24.884
<v Speaker 2>certain country or culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in some cases it might be an </v>

47
00:02:27.201 --> 00:02:30.920
<v Speaker 2>expression of status through association</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the prestigious outgroup.</v>

48
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.120
<v Speaker 2>Number three referential function.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone who is unable to express an idea</v>

49
00:02:35.121 --> 00:02:35.954
<v Speaker 2>easily in one language switches to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other language in order to express it </v>

50
00:02:38.781 --> 00:02:39.614
<v Speaker 2>more easily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This seems to be very common among </v>

51
00:02:41.181 --> 00:02:43.010
<v Speaker 2>bilingual children in immigrant </v>
<v Speaker 2>families.</v>

52
00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.810
<v Speaker 2>Number four,</v>
<v Speaker 2>phatic function.</v>

53
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.010
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes a speaker switches languages </v>
<v Speaker 2>or repeat something in both languages in</v>

54
00:02:49.011 --> 00:02:50.030
<v Speaker 2>order to emphasize it.</v>

55
00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.220
<v Speaker 2>Number five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>metal linguistic function.</v>

56
00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.360
<v Speaker 2>This is reporting something in the other</v>
<v Speaker 2>language or commenting on something said</v>

57
00:02:56.361 --> 00:02:57.980
<v Speaker 2>in the other language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

58
00:02:57.981 --> 00:02:58.814
<v Speaker 2>you're speaking in Japanese,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you quote a lyric from an </v>

59
00:03:00.821 --> 00:03:02.980
<v Speaker 2>English language song without </v>
<v Speaker 2>translating it.</v>

60
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.080
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you'll say something in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>embedded language,</v>

61
00:03:05.081 --> 00:03:08.770
<v Speaker 2>but then you explain it or add further </v>
<v Speaker 2>commentary in the Matrix language.</v>

62
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.903
<v Speaker 2>Number six poetic function.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The speaker says certain words or mixed </v>

63
00:03:12.581 --> 00:03:13.414
<v Speaker 2>jokes in the embedded language for </v>
<v Speaker 2>amusement or for some kind of artistic </v>

64
00:03:16.061 --> 00:03:16.894
<v Speaker 2>purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Code switching takes a few different </v>

65
00:03:18.461 --> 00:03:20.230
<v Speaker 2>forms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here are some of the main ones.</v>

66
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:21.213
<v Speaker 2>Number one inter sentential switching in</v>
<v Speaker 2>which the language switches for entire </v>

67
00:03:24.821 --> 00:03:26.830
<v Speaker 2>sentences or clauses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

68
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.140
<v Speaker 2>a bilingual Spanish English speaker </v>
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>

69
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.000
<v Speaker 2>sometimes I'll start a sentence in </v>
<v Speaker 2>English.</v>

70
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.601
<v Speaker 2>He tell him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

71
00:03:31.601 --> 00:03:33.070
<v Speaker 2>and a spaniel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Number two,</v>

72
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.963
<v Speaker 2>interest sentential switching in which </v>
<v Speaker 2>the speaker switches languages within </v>

73
00:03:36.731 --> 00:03:37.990
<v Speaker 2>the clause or sentence boundaries.</v>

74
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.860
<v Speaker 2>Here's an example from a bilingual </v>
<v Speaker 2>English Portuguese speakers speech.</v>

75
00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.430
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>may you Luca [inaudible] window.</v>

76
00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.080
<v Speaker 2>This means I don't know my place in this</v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

77
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.380
<v Speaker 2>Number three extra sentential or tag </v>
<v Speaker 2>switching.</v>

78
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.820
<v Speaker 2>A tag from one language is inserted into</v>
<v Speaker 2>an utterance in another language.</v>

79
00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.013
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bilingual English Japanese speaker </v>

80
00:03:57.701 --> 00:04:00.850
<v Speaker 2>might say it's a good movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They show meaning it's a good movie,</v>

81
00:04:00.851 --> 00:04:01.684
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's look at a couple of cases of code </v>

82
00:04:04.061 --> 00:04:06.460
<v Speaker 2>switching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first one is from the Indian movie,</v>

83
00:04:06.461 --> 00:04:07.294
<v Speaker 2>the three idiots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Matrix language is Hindi and the </v>

84
00:04:09.461 --> 00:04:12.790
<v Speaker 2>embedded language is English.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The background to this scene is that the</v>

85
00:04:12.791 --> 00:04:16.810
<v Speaker 2>director of a university is welcoming </v>
<v Speaker 2>the incoming freshmen students.</v>

86
00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.860
<v Speaker 3>Hi John Lott.</v>

87
00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:30.603
<v Speaker 2>Now let's take a look at the sentence we</v>
<v Speaker 2>just heard the sentence means don't </v>

88
00:04:33.461 --> 00:04:36.310
<v Speaker 2>forget,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see he receives 400,000</v>

89
00:04:36.311 --> 00:04:40.810
<v Speaker 2>applications a year and of those only </v>
<v Speaker 2>200 are selected you.</v>

90
00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.040
<v Speaker 2>The first clause of this sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't forget it's an English.</v>

91
00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:46.383
<v Speaker 2>This is interesting potential code </v>
<v Speaker 2>switching because the switching occurs </v>

92
00:04:48.791 --> 00:04:49.624
<v Speaker 2>at the clause boundary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is probably done to draw attention </v>

93
00:04:52.181 --> 00:04:54.460
<v Speaker 2>to the phrase which is the phatic </v>
<v Speaker 2>function.</v>

94
00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:55.593
<v Speaker 2>Applications is also an English </v>
<v Speaker 2>switching within the clause or sentence </v>

95
00:04:58.481 --> 00:04:59.314
<v Speaker 2>boundaries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suspect that this words in English </v>

96
00:05:00.851 --> 00:05:01.684
<v Speaker 2>because it's referring to college </v>
<v Speaker 2>applications and words related to </v>

97
00:05:04.571 --> 00:05:05.404
<v Speaker 2>academic affairs are probably said very </v>
<v Speaker 2>frequently in English select is also an </v>

98
00:05:09.131 --> 00:05:09.964
<v Speaker 2>English.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is interest sentential switching </v>

99
00:05:11.261 --> 00:05:12.094
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the speaker or the script writers </v>

100
00:05:13.661 --> 00:05:14.494
<v Speaker 2>probably chose to say this word in </v>
<v Speaker 2>English in order to emphasize the </v>

101
00:05:16.811 --> 00:05:17.644
<v Speaker 2>importance of this action of selecting </v>
<v Speaker 2>the freshmen students and of course you </v>

102
00:05:21.361 --> 00:05:22.194
<v Speaker 2>as an English.</v>

103
00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.560
<v Speaker 2>This is interesting essential because it</v>
<v Speaker 2>occurs at the clause boundary.</v>

104
00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:26.603
<v Speaker 2>This word was probably set apart and set</v>
<v Speaker 2>an English in order to emphasize the </v>

105
00:05:29.791 --> 00:05:32.430
<v Speaker 2>selection of these particular students.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>

106
00:05:32.431 --> 00:05:36.480
<v Speaker 2>that's the phatic function in general.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The speaker in this scene might be using</v>

107
00:05:36.481 --> 00:05:39.000
<v Speaker 2>English because he's the director of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>university,</v>

108
00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:42.000
<v Speaker 2>and English is seen as an integral part </v>
<v Speaker 2>of academic life.</v>

109
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:45.450
<v Speaker 2>Let's look at a second example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This time from the Filipino movie,</v>

110
00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.890
<v Speaker 2>My baby love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

111
00:05:46.891 --> 00:05:50.550
<v Speaker 2>the background to the scene is that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>young woman's father and the young man's</v>

112
00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:51.443
<v Speaker 2>aunts have started dating each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's take a look at the whole scene </v>

113
00:05:53.791 --> 00:05:54.624
<v Speaker 2>first.</v>

114
00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:56.740
<v Speaker 3>That long</v>

115
00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:02.400
<v Speaker 4>mopping,</v>
<v Speaker 4>personal libre,</v>

116
00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:07.500
<v Speaker 4>excusing [inaudible] mommy go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll be in [inaudible].</v>

117
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.520
<v Speaker 4>So I'm people in it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

118
