<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and </v>

2
00:00:09.211 --> 00:00:10.044
<v Speaker 1>my name is Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today's topic is the Japanese language </v>

3
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.213
<v Speaker 1>or as it's called in Japanese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Japanese has around 126 million native </v>

4
00:00:19.941 --> 00:00:23.600
<v Speaker 1>speakers making it the ninth most spoken</v>
<v Speaker 1>language in the world.</v>

5
00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:24.493
<v Speaker 1>If we focus on native speakers alone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's spoken mainly in the Northeast </v>

6
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.873
<v Speaker 1>Asian nation of Japan and also to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>limited extent in some immigrant </v>

7
00:00:31.971 --> 00:00:36.140
<v Speaker 1>communities and amongst some elderly </v>
<v Speaker 1>people living in Japan's former colonies</v>

8
00:00:36.141 --> 00:00:36.974
<v Speaker 1>like Korea and Taiwan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Japanese belongs to the Japonica </v>

9
00:00:39.951 --> 00:00:40.784
<v Speaker 1>language family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which also includes the endangered Yuku </v>

10
00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.220
<v Speaker 1>on languages of Okinawa and the Emami </v>
<v Speaker 1>islands,</v>

11
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:47.143
<v Speaker 1>but the early history of Japanese and </v>
<v Speaker 1>its relationship to other languages is </v>

12
00:00:50.481 --> 00:00:53.660
<v Speaker 1>largely unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are theories that the Japanese and</v>

13
00:00:53.661 --> 00:00:57.950
<v Speaker 1>Korean languages share a common ancestor</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there are theories that Japanese and</v>

14
00:00:57.951 --> 00:00:58.784
<v Speaker 1>Korean are part of a wider language </v>
<v Speaker 1>family called the [inaudible] language </v>

15
00:01:01.671 --> 00:01:02.504
<v Speaker 1>family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which also includes the Turkic </v>

16
00:01:03.591 --> 00:01:04.424
<v Speaker 1>languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mongolian and the tongue gooseneck </v>

17
00:01:06.141 --> 00:01:06.974
<v Speaker 1>languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the alltech language family and the </v>

18
00:01:09.261 --> 00:01:10.094
<v Speaker 1>connection between Japanese and Korean </v>
<v Speaker 1>are theoretic there hotly debated and </v>

19
00:01:13.551 --> 00:01:14.990
<v Speaker 1>are not generally accepted.</v>

20
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:16.213
<v Speaker 1>There are also theories that Japanese </v>
<v Speaker 1>are rose from contact between the </v>

21
00:01:19.011 --> 00:01:19.844
<v Speaker 1>language of the aoe people who migrated </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the North East Asia and mainland </v>

22
00:01:23.061 --> 00:01:23.894
<v Speaker 1>into Japan two to 3000 years ago and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>language or languages of the Jomon </v>

23
00:01:28.071 --> 00:01:28.904
<v Speaker 1>people who were already living there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the nature of the languages that </v>

24
00:01:32.271 --> 00:01:34.850
<v Speaker 1>these two groups of people spoke is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly known.</v>

25
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.990
<v Speaker 1>Japanese was not a written language in </v>
<v Speaker 1>its early history during the [inaudible]</v>

26
00:01:38.991 --> 00:01:39.824
<v Speaker 1>period,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which leaves us very little evidence of </v>

27
00:01:41.391 --> 00:01:45.050
<v Speaker 1>what it was actually like during that </v>
<v Speaker 1>time in the third century ce,</v>

28
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:45.943
<v Speaker 1>the Yamato States in Japan established </v>
<v Speaker 1>relations with China and the next 600 </v>

29
00:01:50.001 --> 00:01:50.834
<v Speaker 1>years would be a period of heavy Chinese</v>
<v Speaker 1>influence during which the rulers and </v>

30
00:01:54.111 --> 00:01:57.500
<v Speaker 1>the elite sought to emulate many aspects</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Chinese culture.</v>

31
00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.480
<v Speaker 1>Written Chinese was probably introduced </v>
<v Speaker 1>to Japan in the fourth century and since</v>

32
00:02:02.481 --> 00:02:03.314
<v Speaker 1>Japanese had no written form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>classical Chinese became the first </v>

33
00:02:06.141 --> 00:02:08.180
<v Speaker 1>literary language used by the elite.</v>

34
00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.200
<v Speaker 1>Later Chinese characters began being </v>
<v Speaker 1>adapted to write Japanese.</v>

35
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.153
<v Speaker 1>The earliest examples we have of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Japanese writing are from the eighth </v>

36
00:02:15.651 --> 00:02:20.640
<v Speaker 1>century and there are two forms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cumbersome and manual.</v>

37
00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:21.493
<v Speaker 1>Ghana come Boone's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the writing of Japanese in </v>

38
00:02:24.681 --> 00:02:25.514
<v Speaker 1>classical Chinese style using Chinese </v>
<v Speaker 1>characters to represent the meaning of </v>

39
00:02:28.851 --> 00:02:32.030
<v Speaker 1>Japanese words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These texts were essentially Chinese,</v>

40
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.520
<v Speaker 1>but were intended to be readable in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Japanese.</v>

41
00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:35.683
<v Speaker 1>Manual in Ghana was a way of writing </v>
<v Speaker 1>Japanese entirely in Chinese characters </v>

42
00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:40.663
<v Speaker 1>with most of the characters representing</v>
<v Speaker 1>the phonetic sound of the underlying </v>

43
00:02:43.731 --> 00:02:46.490
<v Speaker 1>Japanese syllables.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

44
00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.353
<v Speaker 1>the Japanese word for Mountain Yama was </v>
<v Speaker 1>written using these two Chinese </v>

45
00:02:50.871 --> 00:02:55.070
<v Speaker 1>characters for their phonetic value </v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than using the Chinese character,</v>

46
00:02:55.071 --> 00:02:55.904
<v Speaker 1>which means mountain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the character used today and </v>

47
00:02:58.671 --> 00:03:01.480
<v Speaker 1>not one Chinese character was used for </v>
<v Speaker 1>each sound.</v>

48
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.930
<v Speaker 1>Numerous different characters could be </v>
<v Speaker 1>used to represent the same sound.</v>

49
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.090
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the syllable car.</v>

50
00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.090
<v Speaker 1>It could be represented by any of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>following characters,</v>

51
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.883
<v Speaker 1>writing Japanese characters phonetically</v>
<v Speaker 1>using Chinese characters that had no </v>

52
00:03:15.041 --> 00:03:19.030
<v Speaker 1>connection to the meaning must have felt</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of unnecessary hard work.</v>

53
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.013
<v Speaker 1>So two systems of simplified phonetic </v>
<v Speaker 1>characters developed from the manual </v>

54
00:03:23.551 --> 00:03:26.110
<v Speaker 1>Ghana System in the eighth and ninth </v>
<v Speaker 1>centuries.</v>

55
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.330
<v Speaker 1>In order to simplify the writing </v>
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>

56
00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.390
<v Speaker 1>These two systems where she had a gunner</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Katakana,</v>

57
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.970
<v Speaker 1>one of the main uses of these new kinds </v>
<v Speaker 1>of systems was to annotate,</v>

58
00:03:34.971 --> 00:03:35.804
<v Speaker 1>to combine texts so that Japanese </v>
<v Speaker 1>speakers could read these classical </v>

59
00:03:38.711 --> 00:03:42.160
<v Speaker 1>Chinese or Chinese style texts as though</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were Japanese.</v>

60
00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.053
<v Speaker 1>Chinese characters represented the </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning of the content words while come </v>

61
00:03:46.031 --> 00:03:50.470
<v Speaker 1>up provided the pronunciation as well as</v>
<v Speaker 1>the grammatical elements and inflections</v>

62
00:03:50.471 --> 00:03:51.304
<v Speaker 1>that were not present in Chinese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some diacritic markers also indicated </v>

63
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.940
<v Speaker 1>how to change the word order when </v>
<v Speaker 1>reading the text in Japanese.</v>

64
00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.013
<v Speaker 1>This method of annotating Chinese texts </v>
<v Speaker 1>with Kona was the precursor to the </v>

65
00:04:02.441 --> 00:04:03.274
<v Speaker 1>modern Japanese writing system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Through this process of trying to make </v>

66
00:04:06.491 --> 00:04:09.970
<v Speaker 1>the written Chinese language fit with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the spoken Japanese language,</v>

67
00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:10.923
<v Speaker 1>a huge amount of Chinese vocabulary </v>
<v Speaker 1>entered Japanese Chinese characters </v>

68
00:04:14.381 --> 00:04:15.214
<v Speaker 1>where sometimes annotated to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>pronounced with their Chinese </v>

69
00:04:17.531 --> 00:04:18.364
<v Speaker 1>pronunciation known as on your me and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes pronounced as a native </v>

70
00:04:21.881 --> 00:04:22.714
<v Speaker 1>Japanese word with a similar meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These pronunciations are known as who </v>

71
00:04:25.821 --> 00:04:26.654
<v Speaker 1>Naomi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Such Chinese words have become an </v>

72
00:04:28.421 --> 00:04:32.680
<v Speaker 1>integral part of Japanese comprising 60%</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the total vocabulary,</v>

73
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:33.633
<v Speaker 1>particularly in writing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>During the late middle Japanese period </v>

74
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.233
<v Speaker 1>from the year 1185 to 16 hundreds </v>
<v Speaker 1>Japanese continued to develop and move </v>

75
00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:44.270
<v Speaker 1>to closer towards modern Japanese </v>
<v Speaker 1>pharmacologically.</v>

76
00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:45.303
<v Speaker 1>In particular towards the end of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>time period in the year 1543 the first </v>

77
00:04:49.391 --> 00:04:50.224
<v Speaker 1>Europeans visited Japan and some </v>
<v Speaker 1>European vocabulary entered Japanese </v>

78
00:04:54.041 --> 00:04:56.320
<v Speaker 1>through contact with traders and </v>
<v Speaker 1>missionaries.</v>

79
00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:57.723
<v Speaker 1>This contact mostly came to a halt </v>
<v Speaker 1>during the period of national isolation </v>

80
00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:02.373
<v Speaker 1>from 1603 to 1853 during this time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>contact with foreigners was strictly </v>

81
00:05:07.181 --> 00:05:12.040
<v Speaker 1>limited to a couple of specific places </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the Dutch trading post dead Jima in</v>

82
00:05:12.041 --> 00:05:15.220
<v Speaker 1>Nagasaki.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A significant number of Dutch loan words</v>

83
00:05:15.221 --> 00:05:17.350
<v Speaker 1>did enter Japanese during this time </v>
<v Speaker 1>period.</v>

84
00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:22.390
<v Speaker 1>Some of them common everyday words like </v>
<v Speaker 1>from clueless,</v>

85
00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.230
<v Speaker 1>from lump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from coffee,</v>

86
00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.233
<v Speaker 1>from cope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These words are examples of lone words </v>

87
00:05:31.511 --> 00:05:33.760
<v Speaker 1>aside from Chinese borrowings and </v>
<v Speaker 1>compounds.</v>

88
00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:36.130
<v Speaker 1>Normally loan words from European </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages,</v>

89
00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:37.023
<v Speaker 1>which are normally written in Katakana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This period of isolation took place </v>

90
00:05:40.121 --> 00:05:44.220
<v Speaker 1>during the Ed Oh period during which the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Capitol moved from conside to adal.</v>

91
00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:45.303
<v Speaker 1>Present Day Tokyo and the Ed or dialect </v>
<v Speaker 1>became the standard variety of Japanese </v>

92
00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:53.920
<v Speaker 1>after this period of isolation ended in </v>
<v Speaker 1>1853 interaction with the.</v>
