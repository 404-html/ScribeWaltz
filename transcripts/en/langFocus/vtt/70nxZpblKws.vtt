00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:14.553
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and </v>

4
00:00:16.331 --> 00:00:17.164
<v Speaker 1>my name is Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today's topic is the Malay language or </v>

5
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.790
<v Speaker 1>Bahasa Melayu as it's called in Malay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People outside of Southeast Asia may not</v>

6
00:00:24.791 --> 00:00:25.624
<v Speaker 1>be very familiar with Malaya,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if we include all speakers of all </v>

7
00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:29.194
<v Speaker 1>varieties of Malay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is one of the top 10 most widely </v>

8
00:00:31.481 --> 00:00:34.390
<v Speaker 1>spoken languages in the world and when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>say widely,</v>

9
00:00:34.391 --> 00:00:39.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean by a large number of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has around 77 million native speakers</v>

10
00:00:39.131 --> 00:00:39.964
<v Speaker 1>and around 173000002nd language speakers</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a total of about $250 million </v>

11
00:00:44.891 --> 00:00:45.790
<v Speaker 1>speakers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

12
00:00:45.791 --> 00:00:47.170
<v Speaker 1>different sources give different </v>
<v Speaker 1>numbers,</v>

13
00:00:47.171 --> 00:00:48.004
<v Speaker 1>but something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's spoken in Malaysia where it has </v>

14
00:00:49.811 --> 00:00:50.644
<v Speaker 1>around 18 point $5,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million native speakers out of a </v>

15
00:00:52.571 --> 00:00:53.404
<v Speaker 1>population of around 32 million people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Malaysia is an ethnically and </v>

16
00:00:55.961 --> 00:00:56.794
<v Speaker 1>linguistically diverse place with large </v>
<v Speaker 1>communities of people speaking Chinese </v>

17
00:00:59.771 --> 00:01:03.280
<v Speaker 1>and Indian languages as well as numerous</v>
<v Speaker 1>indigenous minority languages.</v>

18
00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.620
<v Speaker 1>Everyone in Malaysia now learns Malaya </v>
<v Speaker 1>at school,</v>

19
00:01:05.621 --> 00:01:06.454
<v Speaker 1>but some speakers of other languages </v>
<v Speaker 1>either aren't fluent in Malay or they </v>

20
00:01:09.131 --> 00:01:12.160
<v Speaker 1>choose not to speak it very much after </v>
<v Speaker 1>they graduate from school.</v>

21
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.550
<v Speaker 1>Singapore is another ethnically diverse </v>
<v Speaker 1>place where Malays are a minority.</v>

22
00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.160
<v Speaker 1>The Malay language is spoken by around </v>
<v Speaker 1>700,000</v>

23
00:01:18.161 --> 00:01:20.590
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were 13 percent of the population.</v>

24
00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.053
<v Speaker 1>It has also spoken by around 266,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>people or about 64 percent of the </v>

25
00:01:26.351 --> 00:01:27.810
<v Speaker 1>population of Brunei.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

26
00:01:27.811 --> 00:01:30.130
<v Speaker 1>That.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not an idiot.</v>

27
00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:31.550
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>

28
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.880
<v Speaker 1>In English we say Brunei.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

29
00:01:33.881 --> 00:01:36.550
<v Speaker 1>You slaughtered the word Bruny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

30
00:01:36.551 --> 00:01:38.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm Bernay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like I was saying,</v>

31
00:01:38.951 --> 00:01:39.784
<v Speaker 1>it's spoken by around 266,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>people or 64 percent of the population </v>

32
00:01:43.631 --> 00:01:44.464
<v Speaker 1>of ru.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has also spoken by around 1 million </v>

33
00:01:46.151 --> 00:01:48.580
<v Speaker 1>people in southern Thailand adjacent to </v>
<v Speaker 1>peninsular,</v>

34
00:01:48.581 --> 00:01:51.390
<v Speaker 1>Malaysia and Malaya spoken by around 11 </v>
<v Speaker 1>point two,</v>

35
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.760
<v Speaker 1>3 million people in Indonesia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's only part of the story.</v>

36
00:01:54.761 --> 00:01:58.030
<v Speaker 1>There were also about $43,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million native speakers of Bahasa,</v>

37
00:01:58.031 --> 00:02:02.560
<v Speaker 1>Indonesia and around 155 second language</v>
<v Speaker 1>speakers have Bahasa Indonesia.</v>

38
00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.740
<v Speaker 1>So what's Bahasa Indonesia?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

39
00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:05.583
<v Speaker 1>when speaking of the Malay language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need to distinguish between Malaya </v>

40
00:02:07.781 --> 00:02:08.614
<v Speaker 1>dialects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which vary from place to place and the </v>

41
00:02:10.421 --> 00:02:11.254
<v Speaker 1>standardized forms of the language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first standardized form of the </v>

42
00:02:13.571 --> 00:02:14.404
<v Speaker 1>languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but has some value which is used in </v>

43
00:02:15.701 --> 00:02:16.600
<v Speaker 1>Malaysia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brunei,</v>

44
00:02:16.601 --> 00:02:17.434
<v Speaker 1>and Singapore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and functions as an umbrella language </v>

45
00:02:19.091 --> 00:02:19.680
<v Speaker 1>for all of them.</v>

46
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.513
<v Speaker 1>Malaya dialects that are spoken there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second standardized form of the </v>

47
00:02:22.931 --> 00:02:26.680
<v Speaker 1>language is Bahasa Indonesia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is used in Indonesia and functions as</v>

48
00:02:26.681 --> 00:02:27.514
<v Speaker 1>a Lingua Franca between speakers of </v>
<v Speaker 1>different languages because there are </v>

49
00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:30.693
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of languages in Indonesia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I planned to focus specifically on </v>

50
00:02:33.131 --> 00:02:35.170
<v Speaker 1>Indonesia and in a different video in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the future.</v>

51
00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.123
<v Speaker 1>This is interesting in Malaysia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the official name of Malaya is Bahasa </v>

52
00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.440
<v Speaker 1>Malaysia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning the language of Malaysia.</v>

53
00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.740
<v Speaker 1>Instead of Bahasa Melayu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means the language of the Malays.</v>

54
00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.310
<v Speaker 1>This name was chosen to show that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>language is a language for all Malaysian</v>

55
00:02:48.311 --> 00:02:50.500
<v Speaker 1>citizens and not only for ethnic </v>
<v Speaker 1>malaise,</v>

56
00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.130
<v Speaker 1>but some people want to change the name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Back to Bahasa Melayu history.</v>

57
00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.113
<v Speaker 1>Malaya is the most widely spoken </v>
<v Speaker 1>language in the Austronesian language </v>

58
00:02:57.941 --> 00:02:58.774
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Austronesian can most likely be </v>

59
00:03:00.521 --> 00:03:04.510
<v Speaker 1>traced back to a common ancestor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Prodo Austronesian in what is now Taiwan</v>

60
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.220
<v Speaker 1>around 5,200</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>

61
00:03:06.221 --> 00:03:08.620
<v Speaker 1>various dialects of rose from protocol </v>
<v Speaker 1>Austronesian,</v>

62
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:09.513
<v Speaker 1>one of them being Polynesian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which began splitting up into various </v>

63
00:03:12.851 --> 00:03:13.684
<v Speaker 1>languages around 4,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago as Austronesian people </v>

64
00:03:15.821 --> 00:03:17.620
<v Speaker 1>expanded to the south from Taiwan.</v>

65
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:18.603
<v Speaker 1>The Malayan Polynesian sub branch </v>
<v Speaker 1>includes most of the Austronesian </v>

66
00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.800
<v Speaker 1>languages outside of Taiwan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Prodo maleic language,</v>

67
00:03:23.801 --> 00:03:24.634
<v Speaker 1>the ancestor of all Malaya dialects </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably originated on the island of </v>

68
00:03:27.611 --> 00:03:32.410
<v Speaker 1>Borneo more than 2000 years ago before </v>
<v Speaker 1>it speakers migrated west to Sumatra and</v>

69
00:03:32.411 --> 00:03:35.500
<v Speaker 1>the Malay peninsula old Malala,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the beginning of the common era.</v>

70
00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.790
<v Speaker 1>And by that I mean after the year one ce</v>
<v Speaker 1>or one add same thing.</v>

71
00:03:39.791 --> 00:03:40.624
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a time of great Indian influence in </v>

72
00:03:42.551 --> 00:03:44.750
<v Speaker 1>the region and during this time old </v>
<v Speaker 1>Molay,</v>

73
00:03:44.751 --> 00:03:47.380
<v Speaker 1>he merged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was highly influenced by Sanskrit and</v>

74
00:03:47.381 --> 00:03:48.214
<v Speaker 1>written in Indian scripts like hot lava,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the oldest known inscriptions of old </v>

75
00:03:51.311 --> 00:03:52.750
<v Speaker 1>Malaya,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Kudu come Buki,</v>

76
00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.470
<v Speaker 1>which were found in Sumatra and date </v>
<v Speaker 1>back to the seventh century ce,</v>

77
00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:57.363
<v Speaker 1>the oldest old mill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a manuscript that still exists today is </v>

78
00:03:59.501 --> 00:04:00.740
<v Speaker 1>the 10th of June,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tonna,</v>

79
00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.260
<v Speaker 1>a legal text from the 14th century still</v>
<v Speaker 1>before Islam was widespread in the area,</v>

80
00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:06.220
<v Speaker 1>classical Malay.</v>

81
00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.030
<v Speaker 1>Islam soon became dominant in the area </v>
<v Speaker 1>and trade with the Muslim world,</v>

82
00:04:10.031 --> 00:04:12.520
<v Speaker 1>increased,</v>
<v Speaker 1>resulting in a lot of Arabic and Persian</v>

83
00:04:12.521 --> 00:04:17.020
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary entering the language and </v>
<v Speaker 1>resulting in the adoption of the script.</v>

84
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.033
<v Speaker 1>John [inaudible] is a version of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Arabic script that was modified to suit </v>

85
00:04:20.231 --> 00:04:22.600
<v Speaker 1>the Malay language during the Malacca </v>
<v Speaker 1>sultanates,</v>

86
00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.300
<v Speaker 1>which was like a kingdom and its </v>
<v Speaker 1>successor,</v>

87
00:04:25.301 --> 00:04:26.134
<v Speaker 1>the Johor Sultanate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Malaya became widely used as a Lingua </v>

88
00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.820
<v Speaker 1>Franca.</v>
<v Speaker 1>During this time,</v>

89
00:04:30.821 --> 00:04:31.654
<v Speaker 1>Islamic literature greatly affected the </v>
<v Speaker 1>language with more Arabic and Persian </v>

90
00:04:34.661 --> 00:04:35.494
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary entering Malaya,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and because Malacca was a busy </v>

91
00:04:38.081 --> 00:04:40.690
<v Speaker 1>international port with people from </v>
<v Speaker 1>various countries,</v>

92
00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.480
<v Speaker 1>Malaysia also absorbed vocabulary from </v>
<v Speaker 1>different languages,</v>

93
00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.080
<v Speaker 1>Tamil and Chinese languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>During this classical malaise period,</v>

94
00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.973
<v Speaker 1>Malaya evolved into something relatively</v>
<v Speaker 1>similar to the Bahasa Melayu and Bahasa </v>

95
00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.873
<v Speaker 1>Indonesia have today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were actually two forms of melee </v>

96
00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:56.350
<v Speaker 1>that became widespread during this time </v>
<v Speaker 1>period.</v>

97
00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.380
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was the formal classical malave,</v>

98
00:04:58.381 --> 00:05:01.360
<v Speaker 1>which was the state language and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>language of courts and literature,</v>

99
00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:03.940
<v Speaker 1>and there was bizarre Malaya or Malaysia</v>
<v Speaker 1>Passata,</v>

100
00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:06.940
<v Speaker 1>a low language spoken by traders as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lingua Franca.</v>

101
00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:07.803
<v Speaker 1>Throughout the archipelago bizarre </v>
<v Speaker 1>Malaya is thought to have been a pigeon </v>

102
00:05:10.121 --> 00:05:12.310
<v Speaker 1>language featuring vocabulary from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Malaya,</v>

103
00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.370
<v Speaker 1>but influenced by other languages such </v>
<v Speaker 1>as Chinese languages,</v>

104
00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:16.323
<v Speaker 1>and there will also local Malaya </v>
<v Speaker 1>dialects that varied from place to </v>

105
00:05:18.431 --> 00:05:19.870
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Premodern molay.</v>

106
00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.140
<v Speaker 1>In the 19th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>European colonial powers were dominating</v>

107
00:05:23.141 --> 00:05:26.230
<v Speaker 1>the region with the Dutch in Indonesia </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the British and Malaysia.</v>

108
00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:27.753
<v Speaker 1>During this time period,</v>
<v Speaker 1>improvements to the printing press made </v>

109
00:05:29.651 --> 00:05:30.484
<v Speaker 1>Malaya books and newspapers more widely </v>
<v Speaker 1>available to the common people so that </v>

110
00:05:33.581 --> 00:05:34.414
<v Speaker 1>literary Malay or classical ballet was </v>
<v Speaker 1>no longer just the language of the </v>

111
00:05:37.481 --> 00:05:38.314
<v Speaker 1>courts and the elite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the literary Malaya of the Malacca and </v>

112
00:05:40.451 --> 00:05:42.370
<v Speaker 1>the Johor Sultanates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

113
00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.233
<v Speaker 1>classical ballet was recognized by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>British and the Dutch as the standard </v>

114
00:05:46.571 --> 00:05:49.090
<v Speaker 1>form of the language and became the </v>
<v Speaker 1>language of education.</v>

115
00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:49.983
<v Speaker 1>One notable change during the colonial </v>
<v Speaker 1>period was the adoption of the Roomi </v>

116
00:05:52.781 --> 00:05:53.614
<v Speaker 1>writing system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the use of Roman characters to write </v>

117
00:05:55.301 --> 00:05:56.134
<v Speaker 1>molay instead of the script and English </v>
<v Speaker 1>loan words began to trickle into </v>

118
00:06:01.071 --> 00:06:03.050
<v Speaker 1>Malaysia and the areas under British </v>
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>

119
00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:04.063
<v Speaker 1>Modern Malaya,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the abundance of Malaya literature in </v>

120
00:06:05.811 --> 00:06:06.644
<v Speaker 1>the 19th century sparked new enthusiasm </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the language and Malaya linguists </v>

121
00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:13.010
<v Speaker 1>began their efforts to standardize and </v>
<v Speaker 1>modernize the language.</v>

122
00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:15.200
<v Speaker 1>In 1936,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Malays scholars,</v>

123
00:06:15.201 --> 00:06:18.230
<v Speaker 1>the above,</v>
<v Speaker 1>published a series of books called Alita</v>

124
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:19.063
<v Speaker 1>Bahasa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in which he updated the grammar of </v>

125
00:06:20.121 --> 00:06:23.660
<v Speaker 1>classical ballet forming the basis of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bahasa Melayu in Bahasa,</v>

126
00:06:23.661 --> 00:06:25.850
<v Speaker 1>Indonesia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In both Malaysia and Indonesia,</v>

127
00:06:25.851 --> 00:06:26.684
<v Speaker 1>the standard form of Malaya became an </v>
<v Speaker 1>important part of their respect of </v>

128
00:06:29.091 --> 00:06:32.060
<v Speaker 1>nationalist movements and their struggle</v>
<v Speaker 1>for independence.</v>

129
00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.000
<v Speaker 1>When Indonesia declared independence in </v>
<v Speaker 1>1945,</v>

130
00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:35.893
<v Speaker 1>Bahasa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indonesia became the national language </v>

131
00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:40.750
<v Speaker 1>and when Malaysia became independent in </v>
<v Speaker 1>1957 Bas,</v>

132
00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:41.593
<v Speaker 1>I'm ally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You became the national language </v>

133
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:45.500
<v Speaker 1>dialects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bahasa Malaysia was the standard form of</v>

134
00:06:45.501 --> 00:06:48.230
<v Speaker 1>Malaya used in Malaysia and Singapore </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then Bruni,</v>

135
00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:50.660
<v Speaker 1>and it's the form of the language taught</v>
<v Speaker 1>in schools,</v>

136
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:51.583
<v Speaker 1>but there are numerous spoken dialects </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Malaya that very not only from </v>

137
00:06:53.841 --> 00:06:54.674
<v Speaker 1>country to country but also from state </v>
<v Speaker 1>to state and from town to town with </v>

138
00:06:57.441 --> 00:06:59.600
<v Speaker 1>differences in pronunciation and </v>
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary.</v>

139
00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:00.553
<v Speaker 1>The Malays spoken at Saba and what tends</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be more similar to that spoken in </v>

140
00:07:03.771 --> 00:07:04.604
<v Speaker 1>Brunei and Singapore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but different from the dialects in west </v>

141
00:07:06.501 --> 00:07:07.334
<v Speaker 1>Malaysia and some states in west </v>
<v Speaker 1>Malaysia are known for being quite </v>

142
00:07:09.771 --> 00:07:11.150
<v Speaker 1>divergent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

143
00:07:11.151 --> 00:07:13.360
<v Speaker 1>the dialects of Colombia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Colombian borders,</v>

144
00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.980
<v Speaker 1>Thailand to the north where a similar </v>
<v Speaker 1>dialects spoken.</v>

145
00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:19.400
<v Speaker 1>The differences that in on everyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>learns standard Malaya at school,</v>

146
00:07:19.401 --> 00:07:22.040
<v Speaker 1>but in southern Thailand everyone learns</v>
<v Speaker 1>tie at school.</v>

147
00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:22.993
<v Speaker 1>This makes cross dialect communication </v>
<v Speaker 1>harder for speakers of Malaysia and </v>

148
00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:26.444
<v Speaker 1>Thailand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for speakers of other Malaya </v>

149
00:07:27.621 --> 00:07:30.260
<v Speaker 1>dialects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Standard Malaysia's a unifying force and</v>

150
00:07:30.261 --> 00:07:33.800
<v Speaker 1>speaking a little more formally can help</v>
<v Speaker 1>people bridge communication gaps.</v>

151
00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:37.850
<v Speaker 1>Standard Malaya is also the form of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Malaya learned by non malaise at school.</v>

152
00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:38.803
<v Speaker 1>So Standard Malaya,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes the language of inter ethnic </v>

153
00:07:40.641 --> 00:07:43.430
<v Speaker 1>communication though some people choose </v>
<v Speaker 1>to speak English instead.</v>

154
00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:46.520
<v Speaker 1>So what is my lay like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like most Austronesian languages,</v>

155
00:07:46.521 --> 00:07:47.354
<v Speaker 1>Malaya is not a tonal language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has simple phonology and every </v>

156
00:07:49.791 --> 00:07:52.070
<v Speaker 1>written character represents only one </v>
<v Speaker 1>sound.</v>

157
00:07:52.071 --> 00:07:55.280
<v Speaker 1>In most cases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has a simple Svo sentence structure,</v>

158
00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:56.120
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

159
00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:56.590
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

160
00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:57.750
<v Speaker 2>Mark can tell you</v>

161
00:07:58.050 --> 00:07:59.490
<v Speaker 1>meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I eat vegetables,</v>

162
00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't eat meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now let's add a modal verb.</v>

163
00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:05.720
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not my.</v>

164
00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:08.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to eat meat.</v>

165
00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:09.980
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not my conducting.</v>

166
00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:11.710
<v Speaker 2>I told me no Zuzu.</v>

167
00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:15.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to eat meat or drink milk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Malaya grammar is simple.</v>

168
00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:17.880
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no grammatical gender.</v>

169
00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:20.713
<v Speaker 1>There are also no noun cases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was also no plural form in </v>

170
00:08:25.311 --> 00:08:27.800
<v Speaker 1>Malaysia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to make a plural explicit,</v>

171
00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:30.260
<v Speaker 1>you reduplicate the word or repeat the </v>
<v Speaker 1>word.</v>

172
00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:31.460
<v Speaker 2>Oh</v>

173
00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:32.300
<v Speaker 1>means a person</v>

174
00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:33.470
<v Speaker 2>all around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all around</v>

175
00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:36.070
<v Speaker 1>means people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And speaking of autumn,</v>

176
00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:37.093
<v Speaker 1>fun fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ordnung means person in Malaysia who </v>

177
00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:43.100
<v Speaker 1>done means forest in Oregon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cooten means forest person,</v>

178
00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:45.620
<v Speaker 1>also known as Orangutang.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

179
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:50.023
<v Speaker 1>If you want to modify a noun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you add the modifying word after the </v>

180
00:08:52.731 --> 00:08:54.950
<v Speaker 1>Noun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the word for book book.</v>

181
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:58.280
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now let's add a demonstrative pronoun to</v>

182
00:08:58.620 --> 00:08:59.453
<v Speaker 1>that book or with a possessive Pronoun </v>
<v Speaker 1>Crusader my book or Buku Buku saying my </v>

183
00:09:05.341 --> 00:09:09.690
<v Speaker 1>books or with an adjective inexpensive </v>
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>

184
00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:10.733
<v Speaker 1>In Malaysia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is no copy of the verb to be at </v>

185
00:09:12.571 --> 00:09:15.900
<v Speaker 1>least in regular speech and there is no </v>
<v Speaker 1>definite or indefinite article,</v>

186
00:09:15.901 --> 00:09:19.200
<v Speaker 1>so we could also mean the book is </v>
<v Speaker 1>expensive,</v>

187
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:24.150
<v Speaker 1>but to be more clear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might say prepositions in Malaya are</v>

188
00:09:24.151 --> 00:09:26.450
<v Speaker 1>very straightforward and intuitive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>

189
00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:29.700
<v Speaker 1>but I tell Daddy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can I come from Canada?</v>

190
00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:35.140
<v Speaker 1>Now I want to go to the night market at </v>
<v Speaker 1>dot.</v>

191
00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:39.270
<v Speaker 1>There was a discount for students in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this sentence.</v>

192
00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:43.490
<v Speaker 1>Other means there is one of the things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes learning my life fund is that</v>

193
00:09:43.491 --> 00:09:44.324
<v Speaker 1>there are no verb conjugations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The form of the verb stays exactly the </v>

194
00:09:46.581 --> 00:09:48.620
<v Speaker 1>same regardless of whether it's in </v>
<v Speaker 1>present tense,</v>

195
00:09:48.621 --> 00:09:49.880
<v Speaker 1>past tense or future tense.</v>

196
00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:53.820
<v Speaker 1>So we have the verb meaning to eat in </v>
<v Speaker 1>present tense on in past tense,</v>

197
00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:55.583
<v Speaker 1>in future tense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mock on the tents is determined by </v>

198
00:09:57.511 --> 00:09:58.344
<v Speaker 1>specifying a time period like goodman he</v>
<v Speaker 1>will eat later or by using an adverb </v>

199
00:10:03.711 --> 00:10:07.290
<v Speaker 1>before the verb game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He will eat,</v>

200
00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:10.223
<v Speaker 1>he already ate or her down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is currently eating what he's eating </v>

201
00:10:15.091 --> 00:10:17.280
<v Speaker 1>now and there are some other adverts </v>
<v Speaker 1>like this,</v>

202
00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:22.200
<v Speaker 1>but of course it's not quite that simple</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we have the verb game to eat,</v>

203
00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:23.153
<v Speaker 1>but we also have the verb Dema came to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be eaten and they're going to be eating </v>

204
00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:31.350
<v Speaker 1>accidentally and we have the verb moment</v>
<v Speaker 1>came to consume.</v>

205
00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:34.920
<v Speaker 1>Then we have moma tend to feed something</v>
<v Speaker 1>to someone.</v>

206
00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:38.340
<v Speaker 1>These are examples of one of my most </v>
<v Speaker 1>challenging features for learners.</v>

207
00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:41.730
<v Speaker 1>It's system of building words from roots</v>
<v Speaker 1>and affixes up above.</v>

208
00:10:41.731 --> 00:10:42.564
<v Speaker 1>We created some new verbs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we can also create other types of </v>

209
00:10:44.641 --> 00:10:46.680
<v Speaker 1>words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not Kenyan food.</v>

210
00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:49.730
<v Speaker 1>Matt gain someone who eats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so boomer.</v>

211
00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:50.793
<v Speaker 1>Nagging means a mediator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Malaya makes extensive use of this kind </v>

212
00:10:53.861 --> 00:10:54.694
<v Speaker 1>of affixation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at one more example of using </v>

213
00:10:56.411 --> 00:10:58.690
<v Speaker 1>the root word [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means to teach.</v>

214
00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:03.860
<v Speaker 1>I didn't teachings to learn to teach </v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

215
00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:10.220
<v Speaker 1>to be taught in transitive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as in I'm being taught be a gay gain,</v>

216
00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:15.090
<v Speaker 1>transitive as in the lesson is being </v>
<v Speaker 1>taught to study,</v>

217
00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:20.700
<v Speaker 1>to be studied by student,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now gay teacher,</v>

218
00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:21.860
<v Speaker 1>Bombilla,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gauteng,</v>

219
00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:22.883
<v Speaker 1>learning bird to be educated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of these affixes might seem </v>

220
00:11:27.261 --> 00:11:28.094
<v Speaker 1>overwhelming at first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're fairly systematic and once </v>

221
00:11:30.021 --> 00:11:32.720
<v Speaker 1>you get used to the function of all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the different affixes,</v>

222
00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:33.703
<v Speaker 1>then it helps you to understand words </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you've never heard before and it </v>

223
00:11:36.171 --> 00:11:38.540
<v Speaker 1>helps you to guess how to say words that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know yet.</v>

224
00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:43.450
<v Speaker 1>Standard Malaya is a very user friendly </v>
<v Speaker 1>language for learners,</v>

225
00:11:43.451 --> 00:11:46.150
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're used to learning </v>
<v Speaker 1>more complex languages.</v>

226
00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:47.193
<v Speaker 1>The biggest challenge that you'll likely</v>
<v Speaker 1>face as the difference between the </v>

227
00:11:49.271 --> 00:11:50.104
<v Speaker 1>formal language and the casual language </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the dialectal variation that you'll </v>

228
00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:57.370
<v Speaker 1>especially different pronunciation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but by learning the standard polite form</v>

229
00:11:57.371 --> 00:11:58.204
<v Speaker 1>of malaria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you form a good basis for communication </v>

230
00:11:59.921 --> 00:12:02.920
<v Speaker 1>and you can learn the more colloquial </v>
<v Speaker 1>style of communication as you go.</v>

231
00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:06.490
<v Speaker 1>Stay tuned for a future episode in which</v>
