00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.750
<v Speaker 1>Wake the fuck up the Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm here to talk some sense into you.</v>

2
00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:04.890
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold on a second.</v>

3
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:05.843
<v Speaker 1>I'm Canadian and when I say Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm including Canadians in that because </v>

4
00:00:09.151 --> 00:00:11.940
<v Speaker 1>Canadians admitted we're really just the</v>
<v Speaker 1>51st state.</v>

5
00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.150
<v Speaker 1>We're like California with Igloos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Canadians,</v>

6
00:00:15.151 --> 00:00:17.010
<v Speaker 1>Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing anywhere.</v>

7
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.800
<v Speaker 1>What was I saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got the Americans.</v>

8
00:00:19.801 --> 00:00:22.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm here to talk some sense into you as </v>
<v Speaker 1>a nation.</v>

9
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:23.543
<v Speaker 1>We suck with languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>43% of all people around the world are </v>

10
00:00:27.841 --> 00:00:28.674
<v Speaker 1>bilingual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That includes over 50% of the people in </v>

11
00:00:31.291 --> 00:00:34.380
<v Speaker 1>Europe and in some countries like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Indonesia and Philippines,</v>

12
00:00:34.381 --> 00:00:35.214
<v Speaker 1>virtually everybody is bilingual and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very common in a lot of countries </v>

13
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.170
<v Speaker 1>for people to speak three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>

14
00:00:40.171 --> 00:00:43.020
<v Speaker 1>or even five languages on a regular </v>
<v Speaker 1>basis.</v>

15
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.430
<v Speaker 1>But in America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only 20% of the people are bilingual.</v>

16
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:48.563
<v Speaker 1>And guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost all of those people are </v>

17
00:00:50.541 --> 00:00:54.590
<v Speaker 1>immigrants or the children of immigrants</v>
<v Speaker 1>amongst homegrown Americans,</v>

18
00:00:54.591 --> 00:00:55.424
<v Speaker 1>very few are bilingual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in the northern province of Canada </v>

19
00:00:58.371 --> 00:01:02.450
<v Speaker 1>at the situation is not much different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of the people who are bilingual are</v>

20
00:01:02.451 --> 00:01:05.660
<v Speaker 1>immigrants or Francophone Canadians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>French speaking,</v>

21
00:01:05.661 --> 00:01:07.430
<v Speaker 1>Canadians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anglophone.</v>

22
00:01:07.431 --> 00:01:09.890
<v Speaker 1>Canadians are generally modeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You will,</v>

23
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.650
<v Speaker 1>very few of them are bilingual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Australia,</v>

24
00:01:12.651 --> 00:01:15.200
<v Speaker 1>the numbers are even worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in Europe,</v>

25
00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.560
<v Speaker 1>guests which countries have the lowest </v>
<v Speaker 1>levels of bilingualism?</v>

26
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.913
<v Speaker 1>So at the point I'm making is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>angler phones basically do not become </v>

27
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.320
<v Speaker 1>bilingual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say that anglophones are</v>

28
00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:31.650
<v Speaker 1>lazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but why the hell are we so damn lazy?</v>

29
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:32.753
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously it's because of a lack of </v>

30
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.410
<v Speaker 1>incentive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>English is the international language.</v>

31
00:01:37.411 --> 00:01:38.244
<v Speaker 1>So why should I put in all this time and</v>
<v Speaker 1>effort to speak another language when </v>

32
00:01:41.131 --> 00:01:43.050
<v Speaker 1>other people will just speak English </v>
<v Speaker 1>with me?</v>

33
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:44.423
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it Kinda sorta arrogant to expect </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the other people to put in all the </v>

34
00:01:48.091 --> 00:01:48.924
<v Speaker 1>effort to accommodate us?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody who has traveled has probably </v>

35
00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:52.644
<v Speaker 1>seen Americans or other anglophones </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting frustrated with the locals when </v>

36
00:01:55.621 --> 00:01:56.454
<v Speaker 1>they couldn't speak English.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if those anglophones had ever </v>

37
00:01:59.191 --> 00:02:01.170
<v Speaker 1>learned a second language for </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>

38
00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.310
<v Speaker 1>maybe they would be able to understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>and empathize with that other person and</v>

39
00:02:05.311 --> 00:02:06.144
<v Speaker 1>find a way to communicate with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The truth is English is not spoken by </v>

40
00:02:09.691 --> 00:02:10.524
<v Speaker 1>most people in the world despite the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that it's the de facto </v>

41
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.400
<v Speaker 1>international language.</v>

42
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:15.593
<v Speaker 1>Most people simply don't speak English </v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you stick to the men tourist </v>

43
00:02:18.421 --> 00:02:21.090
<v Speaker 1>traps and who likes cheesy tourist </v>
<v Speaker 1>traps.</v>

44
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.193
<v Speaker 1>Knowing another major language can </v>
<v Speaker 1>greatly help you communicate around the </v>

45
00:02:24.991 --> 00:02:25.824
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there's also no guarantee that </v>

46
00:02:26.971 --> 00:02:29.940
<v Speaker 1>English will be the international </v>
<v Speaker 1>language for much longer.</v>

47
00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.300
<v Speaker 1>Not too long ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the international language was French,</v>

48
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.420
<v Speaker 1>and in the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it will be Chinese or Spanish.</v>

49
00:02:36.421 --> 00:02:37.920
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

50
00:02:37.921 --> 00:02:40.590
<v Speaker 1>it probably won't be Chinese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you never know.</v>

51
00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.300
<v Speaker 1>The number of Spanish speakers is </v>
<v Speaker 1>growing rapidly,</v>

52
00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:44.403
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of Spanish speaking countries </v>
<v Speaker 1>are in the process of developing </v>

53
00:02:47.261 --> 00:02:48.094
<v Speaker 1>rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Spanish could become much more </v>

54
00:02:49.781 --> 00:02:51.670
<v Speaker 1>important than the near future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But even if.</v>
