<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:05.053
<v Speaker 2>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and </v>

3
00:00:06.951 --> 00:00:10.850
<v Speaker 2>my name is Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did Greek influence English?</v>

4
00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.210
<v Speaker 2>That is the question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As I mentioned in my recent video on the</v>

5
00:00:14.211 --> 00:00:15.044
<v Speaker 2>Greek language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Greek is a language that has influenced </v>

6
00:00:17.031 --> 00:00:17.864
<v Speaker 2>many others including English.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The most remarkable way that Greek has </v>

7
00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.000
<v Speaker 2>influenced English isn't it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>vocabulary.</v>

8
00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.893
<v Speaker 2>In my previous video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I briefly mentioned that around six </v>

9
00:00:26.181 --> 00:00:29.270
<v Speaker 2>percent of the vocabulary of English is </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Greek origin,</v>

10
00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.930
<v Speaker 2>but that some estimates reach as high as</v>
<v Speaker 2>12 or 15 percent.</v>

11
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.650
<v Speaker 2>This depends on how you measure it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can measure type frequency,</v>

12
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:37.543
<v Speaker 2>the percentage of the total number of </v>
<v Speaker 2>words with no regard for how often </v>

13
00:00:40.341 --> 00:00:43.220
<v Speaker 2>they're used or you can measure a token </v>
<v Speaker 2>frequency,</v>

14
00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.490
<v Speaker 2>meaning the proportion of words in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>given speech or text,</v>

15
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.060
<v Speaker 2>so words that are more frequently used </v>
<v Speaker 2>account for a larger proportion.</v>

16
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:51.673
<v Speaker 2>There's a huge number of words of Greek </v>
<v Speaker 2>origin that are used in specialized </v>

17
00:00:54.531 --> 00:00:56.240
<v Speaker 2>areas of the sciences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>medicine,</v>

18
00:00:56.241 --> 00:00:59.750
<v Speaker 2>and technology that aren't used very </v>
<v Speaker 2>often in regular speech.</v>

19
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:00.763
<v Speaker 2>So if we measure type frequency,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the percentage of Greek words will be </v>

20
00:01:03.561 --> 00:01:06.590
<v Speaker 2>higher because less common words are </v>
<v Speaker 2>given equal weight.</v>

21
00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:07.693
<v Speaker 2>If we measure a token frequency,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the percentage will be lower because </v>

22
00:01:10.311 --> 00:01:14.510
<v Speaker 2>less common words are counted less.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that the figure of six percent</v>

23
00:01:14.511 --> 00:01:15.344
<v Speaker 2>is based on token frequency and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>higher figures are based on type </v>

24
00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:18.813
<v Speaker 2>frequency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some Greek words were borrowed directly </v>

25
00:01:20.781 --> 00:01:24.080
<v Speaker 2>from Greek into English.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of these were borrowed early in the</v>

26
00:01:24.081 --> 00:01:27.920
<v Speaker 2>history of English like church from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Greek word [inaudible],</v>

27
00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.353
<v Speaker 2>which entered old English as cute chick </v>
<v Speaker 2>and some were borrowed later in the </v>

28
00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.180
<v Speaker 2>early modern English period.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

29
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.073
<v Speaker 2>autonomy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This word entered English directly from </v>

30
00:01:37.941 --> 00:01:41.450
<v Speaker 2>ancient Greek out to nomia in the 16 </v>
<v Speaker 2>twenties,</v>

31
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.710
<v Speaker 2>but a larger number of Greek words </v>
<v Speaker 2>entered English indirectly through Latin</v>

32
00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.260
<v Speaker 2>or through Latin than French.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

33
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.153
<v Speaker 2>museum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This comes from the Latin word </v>

34
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.450
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning library or study,</v>

35
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.630
<v Speaker 2>and that comes from the ancient Greek </v>
<v Speaker 2>word Moose sale,</v>

36
00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.000
<v Speaker 2>which meant place of study,</v>
<v Speaker 2>library,</v>

37
00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.520
<v Speaker 2>museum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or school of art or poetry.</v>

38
00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:02.743
<v Speaker 2>And if we go back even further to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>original meaning of the ancient Greek </v>

39
00:02:05.571 --> 00:02:06.404
<v Speaker 2>word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it meant the seat or shrine of the </v>

40
00:02:08.001 --> 00:02:08.834
<v Speaker 2>muses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The nine muses were the daughters of </v>

41
00:02:10.491 --> 00:02:11.324
<v Speaker 2>Zeus in the Masani.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were goddesses who symbolized the </v>

42
00:02:13.671 --> 00:02:16.100
<v Speaker 2>arts and sciences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another example,</v>

43
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.190
<v Speaker 2>the word olive entered the English </v>
<v Speaker 2>language around the twelfth century ce,</v>

44
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.330
<v Speaker 2>either from old French bullies or </v>
<v Speaker 2>directly from Latin Oliva or Oliva,</v>

45
00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.670
<v Speaker 2>which in turn comes from the Greek word </v>
<v Speaker 2>a lie.</v>

46
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.240
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the word chaos comes from the Greek word</v>

47
00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.153
<v Speaker 2>cows and entered English in the 14th </v>
<v Speaker 2>century via Latin than French </v>

48
00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:42.820
<v Speaker 2>catastrophe entered English and the 15 </v>
<v Speaker 2>thirties from Latin catastrophe from the</v>

49
00:02:43.101 --> 00:02:43.934
<v Speaker 2>Greek word catastrophe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was originally pronounced as </v>

50
00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.510
<v Speaker 2>cholesterol pay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning and overturning or a sudden end.</v>

51
00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.260
<v Speaker 2>The word democracy entered English in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the 15 seventies.</v>

52
00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:55.243
<v Speaker 2>It came from the middle French word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They mccloskey which in turn came from </v>

53
00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.840
<v Speaker 2>medieval Latin Democrat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which came from ancient Greek.</v>

54
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.550
<v Speaker 2>The word paragraph entered English in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the late 14,</v>

55
00:03:06.551 --> 00:03:07.384
<v Speaker 2>hundreds via medieval Latin and French,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it comes from the Greek word </v>

56
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.873
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was originally pronounced as </v>

57
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:14.633
<v Speaker 2>paddock it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I pause and there are many more words </v>

58
00:03:16.811 --> 00:03:17.644
<v Speaker 2>like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the largest number of Greek words to </v>

59
00:03:19.481 --> 00:03:22.090
<v Speaker 2>enter English.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're actually newly created words.</v>

60
00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.760
<v Speaker 2>They were newly created using Greek </v>
<v Speaker 2>morphemes,</v>

61
00:03:24.761 --> 00:03:27.940
<v Speaker 2>but they're words that hadn't existed in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Greek before that point.</v>

62
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.000
<v Speaker 2>And then those words were borrowed from </v>
<v Speaker 2>Latin into English.</v>

63
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.280
<v Speaker 2>Some are formed from only Greek </v>
<v Speaker 2>morphemes,</v>

64
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.110
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>photography.</v>

65
00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.770
<v Speaker 2>This word was created in 1834 by </v>
<v Speaker 2>combining photo,</v>

66
00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.470
<v Speaker 2>which meant lights in ancient Greek and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ancient Greek suffix graffel meaning</v>

67
00:03:44.471 --> 00:03:47.320
<v Speaker 2>to scratch or to scrape,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but later meaning to right.</v>

68
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:50.980
<v Speaker 2>And if you're wondering how those </v>
<v Speaker 2>different meanings are related to scrape</v>

69
00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.903
<v Speaker 2>and to write well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think about how people used to write </v>

70
00:03:53.951 --> 00:03:54.784
<v Speaker 2>thousands of years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They used to scrape letters into stone </v>

71
00:03:56.921 --> 00:03:57.754
<v Speaker 2>tablets.</v>

72
00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.640
<v Speaker 2>Another word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>xenophobia or xenophobia.</v>

73
00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.060
<v Speaker 2>This word was created in 19 Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three from the Greek root,</v>

74
00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:08.350
<v Speaker 2>phenols meaning alien and phobia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning fear.</v>

75
00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.053
<v Speaker 2>Other words were formed from a </v>
<v Speaker 2>combination of both Greek and Latin </v>

76
00:04:12.521 --> 00:04:13.960
<v Speaker 2>morphemes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

77
00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.823
<v Speaker 2>television.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This word was created from the Greek </v>

78
00:04:16.421 --> 00:04:19.270
<v Speaker 2>morpheme t lay meaning far or at a </v>
<v Speaker 2>distance.</v>

79
00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.390
<v Speaker 2>And the French word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vco meaning site.</v>

80
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.480
<v Speaker 2>This word entered English via French.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another example,</v>

81
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:26.463
<v Speaker 2>automobile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first part comes from ancient Greek </v>

82
00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:30.520
<v Speaker 2>autos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning self.</v>

83
00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.260
<v Speaker 2>And the second part comes from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>French word [inaudible],</v>

84
00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.950
<v Speaker 2>which means moving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which came from Latin moby.</v>

85
00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.600
<v Speaker 2>These movable sociology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first part comes from the Latin word</v>

86
00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.490
<v Speaker 2>Celsius,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning comrade,</v>

87
00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:45.640
<v Speaker 2>and the second part comes from the Greek</v>
<v Speaker 2>morpheme loggia,</v>

88
00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:46.773
<v Speaker 2>meaning discourse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now just have a look at them morphemes </v>

89
00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.073
<v Speaker 2>that are highlighted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've probably seen many more words </v>

90
00:04:52.091 --> 00:04:52.924
<v Speaker 2>that feature these same Greek morphemes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are lots of common Greek roots in </v>

91
00:04:56.711 --> 00:04:57.940
<v Speaker 2>English,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

92
00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.790
<v Speaker 2>and throat meaning man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crone or Chron,</v>

93
00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.870
<v Speaker 2>meaning time them meaning people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>head meaning child.</v>

94
00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:06.243
<v Speaker 2>There are also many Greek affixes app or</v>
<v Speaker 2>an meaning without by or bio meaning </v>

95
00:05:11.051 --> 00:05:11.884
<v Speaker 2>life or living thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hyper meaning excessive micro meaning </v>

96
00:05:15.191 --> 00:05:20.191
<v Speaker 2>small geo meaning earth or geography,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anti meaning against it,</v>

97
00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.140
<v Speaker 2>a suffix that forms adjectives and many </v>
<v Speaker 2>more.</v>

98
00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:28.150
<v Speaker 2>A huge number of these newly coined </v>
<v Speaker 2>words exist in areas of academia,</v>

99
00:05:28.151 --> 00:05:29.320
<v Speaker 2>medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>science,</v>

100
00:05:29.321 --> 00:05:30.154
<v Speaker 2>and technology because the huge </v>
<v Speaker 2>advancements in these areas over the </v>

101
00:05:32.831 --> 00:05:33.664
<v Speaker 2>past 500 years required the creation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>lots of new vocabulary in the field of </v>

102
00:05:37.661 --> 00:05:38.830
<v Speaker 2>medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

103
00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:40.620
<v Speaker 2>Latin words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both old and new,</v>

104
00:05:40.621 --> 00:05:43.420
<v Speaker 2>newly coined ones were often used for </v>
<v Speaker 2>anatomy.</v>

105
00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:47.200
<v Speaker 2>While Greek words were used for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>names of illnesses or specializations.</v>

106
00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.810
<v Speaker 2>A lot of these specialized words are not</v>
<v Speaker 2>used in daily conversation very often,</v>

107
00:05:52.811 --> 00:05:53.644
<v Speaker 2>but without them it will be very </v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult to talk about these advanced </v>

108
00:05:56.081 --> 00:05:56.914
<v Speaker 2>fields of study.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also worth noting that these words </v>

109
00:05:58.911 --> 00:06:00.560
<v Speaker 2>are not exclusive to English.</v>

110
00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:01.393
<v Speaker 2>A lot of them are used in other </v>
<v Speaker 2>languages as well when talking about </v>

111
00:06:03.741 --> 00:06:04.574
<v Speaker 2>those fields of study.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here are a couple of hints on how to </v>

112
00:06:06.561 --> 00:06:10.460
<v Speaker 2>recognize Greek vocabulary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most words starting with Ph are Greek.</v>

113
00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:12.403
<v Speaker 2>Some vowels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spellings give us a hint like aee or </v>

114
00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:15.620
<v Speaker 2>oee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Together,</v>

115
00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:20.240
<v Speaker 2>if you see a wide between consonants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's likely a Greek word.</v>

116
00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:23.780
<v Speaker 2>If a word starts with any of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>consonant clusters,</v>

117
00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:26.090
<v Speaker 2>then it's almost certainly a word of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Greek origin.</v>

118
00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:27.643
<v Speaker 2>Some of these clusters can't be </v>
<v Speaker 2>pronounced in English like ps or pen or </v>

119
00:06:31.221 --> 00:06:32.054
<v Speaker 2>Gen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the first letter is dropped in </v>

120
00:06:33.381 --> 00:06:34.214
<v Speaker 2>pronunciation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>An interesting example back in the 19 </v>

121
00:06:37.221 --> 00:06:39.080
<v Speaker 2>fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>professor sandol phones,</v>

122
00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:39.923
<v Speaker 2>the Lotus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Greek economist and the 75th prime </v>

123
00:06:42.441 --> 00:06:43.274
<v Speaker 2>minister of Greece gave two speeches in </v>
<v Speaker 2>which she addressed the audience in </v>

124
00:06:46.101 --> 00:06:46.934
<v Speaker 2>English,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but using exclusively words of Greek </v>

125
00:06:48.771 --> 00:06:51.740
<v Speaker 2>origin with the exception of grammar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>words like articles,</v>

126
00:06:51.741 --> 00:06:53.390
<v Speaker 2>prepositions and conjunctions.</v>

127
00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:54.313
<v Speaker 2>All of the content where it's wearing </v>
<v Speaker 2>Greek here is a piece of one of those </v>

128
00:06:56.901 --> 00:06:57.734
<v Speaker 2>speeches which he gave to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>International Bank for Reconstruction </v>

129
00:07:00.321 --> 00:07:01.154
<v Speaker 2>and development.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is Zeus and that's them up on our </v>

130
00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:03.853
<v Speaker 2>epoch for the dynamism of our economies </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the heresy of our economic methods </v>

131
00:07:07.671 --> 00:07:08.504
<v Speaker 2>and policies that we should agonize </v>
<v Speaker 2>between the seller of numismatic </v>

132
00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:14.330
<v Speaker 2>plethora and the curb dis of economic </v>
<v Speaker 2>anemia.</v>

133
00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:18.290
<v Speaker 2>It is not my idiosyncrasy to be ironic </v>
<v Speaker 2>or sarcastic,</v>

134
00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:19.153
<v Speaker 2>but my diagnosis would be that </v>
<v Speaker 2>politicians are rather crypto plethora </v>

135
00:07:22.181 --> 00:07:23.014
<v Speaker 2>wrists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although they emphatically stigmatized </v>

136
00:07:24.651 --> 00:07:25.484
<v Speaker 2>numismatic plethora,</v>
<v Speaker 2>energize it through their tactics and </v>

137
00:07:27.621 --> 00:07:28.454
<v Speaker 2>practices.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our policies have to be based more on </v>

138
00:07:30.441 --> 00:07:33.140
<v Speaker 2>economic and less on political criteria.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

139
00:07:33.141 --> 00:07:37.340
<v Speaker 2>let's break that down a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first part it is Zeus is anathema on</v>

140
00:07:37.341 --> 00:07:38.174
<v Speaker 2>our epoch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This means it is [inaudible] curse or a </v>

141
00:07:40.541 --> 00:07:44.570
<v Speaker 2>punishment on our time or era.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In a typical English sentence,</v>

142
00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.990
<v Speaker 2>you might expect to see God in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>context instead of Zeus,</v>

143
00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:49.153
<v Speaker 2>for the dynamism of our economies and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the heresy of our economic methods and </v>

144
00:07:52.461 --> 00:07:53.150
<v Speaker 2>policies.</v>

145
00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:55.400
<v Speaker 2>Here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's saying that Zeus is punishment,</v>

146
00:07:55.460 --> 00:08:00.460
<v Speaker 2>is for the uncontrolled activity of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>economies and our economic heresy,</v>

147
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:03.950
<v Speaker 2>meaning violating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>accepted economic ideas,</v>

148
00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:05.083
<v Speaker 2>and next he'll explain what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>punishment is that we should agonize </v>

149
00:08:07.911 --> 00:08:08.744
<v Speaker 2>between the seller of numismatic </v>
<v Speaker 2>plethora and the coverup this of </v>

150
00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:14.480
<v Speaker 2>economic anemia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now these two words here,</v>

151
00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:17.990
<v Speaker 2>Scylla and Charybdis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are actually characters from Greek</v>

152
00:08:17.991 --> 00:08:20.780
<v Speaker 2>mythology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are to mythical sea monsters,</v>

153
00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:25.100
<v Speaker 2>too dangerous monsters that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult to navigate between because if</v>

154
00:08:25.101 --> 00:08:27.770
<v Speaker 2>you move away from one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you move toward the other.</v>

155
00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:31.430
<v Speaker 2>Their names here are indicating to </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous situations,</v>

156
00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:35.390
<v Speaker 2>so the first of those two dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 2>situations is numismatic plethora.</v>

157
00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:40.540
<v Speaker 2>Numismatic means related to coins or </v>
<v Speaker 2>currency and plethora means abundance or</v>

158
00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:44.510
<v Speaker 2>a lot of these two words together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>me and inflation,</v>

159
00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:47.210
<v Speaker 2>meaning there's too much currency in </v>
<v Speaker 2>circulation,</v>

160
00:08:47.211 --> 00:08:50.450
<v Speaker 2>so prices increase.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the second dangerous situation,</v>

161
00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.420
<v Speaker 2>the curb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is economic anemia.</v>

162
00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:56.640
<v Speaker 2>Anemia meaning stagnation or loss of </v>
<v Speaker 2>energy.</v>

163
00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:00.120
<v Speaker 2>Most of the second part is probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>easier to understand,</v>

164
00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.073
<v Speaker 2>but let's look at one part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my diagnosis would be that </v>

165
00:09:03.601 --> 00:09:06.360
<v Speaker 2>politicians are rather crypto plethora,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrists.</v>

166
00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:10.880
<v Speaker 2>Now this word requires a look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crypto means secret and plethora.</v>

167
00:09:10.881 --> 00:09:13.050
<v Speaker 2>Wrists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>remember that word before Plethora,</v>

168
00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:16.440
<v Speaker 2>which means abundance or a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it's.</v>

169
00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:19.050
<v Speaker 2>That's an affix showing the dewar of an </v>
<v Speaker 2>action.</v>

170
00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.153
<v Speaker 2>So Plethora.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wrists are people who create an </v>

171
00:09:21.841 --> 00:09:24.120
<v Speaker 2>abundance of money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They create inflation,</v>

172
00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:28.080
<v Speaker 2>although they emphatically stigmatize </v>
<v Speaker 2>numismatic plethora,</v>

173
00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.330
<v Speaker 2>although they speak badly about </v>
<v Speaker 2>inflation,</v>

174
00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:33.390
<v Speaker 2>they energize it through their tactics </v>
<v Speaker 2>and practices.</v>

175
00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:37.560
<v Speaker 2>He's saying that politicians are </v>
<v Speaker 2>secretly creating inflation despite what</v>

176
00:09:37.561 --> 00:09:39.600
<v Speaker 2>they say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just an excerpt,</v>

177
00:09:39.601 --> 00:09:40.434
<v Speaker 2>but I'll leave a link to the full </v>
<v Speaker 2>version of the two speeches in the </v>

178
00:09:42.571 --> 00:09:44.340
<v Speaker 2>description below.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

179
00:09:44.341 --> 00:09:45.174
<v Speaker 2>the irony of me describing that speech </v>
<v Speaker 2>in standard English is that I've </v>

180
00:09:47.851 --> 00:09:51.810
<v Speaker 2>probably used a lot of words of Greek </v>
<v Speaker 2>origin myself without realizing it.</v>

181
00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:52.793
<v Speaker 2>So the question of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were you surprised to discover how much </v>

182
00:09:55.171 --> 00:09:56.004
<v Speaker 2>English vocabulary comes from Greek?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Were you surprised by any of the </v>

183
00:09:58.831 --> 00:10:00.180
<v Speaker 2>examples?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>

184
00:10:00.181 --> 00:10:03.450
<v Speaker 2>feel free to leave additional examples </v>

<v Speaker 2>and Instagram,</v>
