<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and </v>

2
00:00:02.931 --> 00:00:06.210
<v Speaker 1>my name is Paul today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is just a quick video to talk about</v>

3
00:00:06.211 --> 00:00:07.044
<v Speaker 1>an interesting linguistic phenomenon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that might come up in some of </v>

4
00:00:09.781 --> 00:00:14.070
<v Speaker 1>my videos in the future and that is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>topic of language isolates.</v>

5
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:15.143
<v Speaker 1>Often when I talk about languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talk about the family that language </v>

6
00:00:17.941 --> 00:00:21.600
<v Speaker 1>belongs to and how it's related to other</v>
<v Speaker 1>languages in that family.</v>

7
00:00:21.601 --> 00:00:22.434
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hebrew and Arabic are sister languages </v>

8
00:00:24.751 --> 00:00:25.584
<v Speaker 1>of the Semitic language family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>French and Italian are sister languages </v>

9
00:00:28.801 --> 00:00:29.634
<v Speaker 1>of the romance language family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but did you know that there are some </v>

10
00:00:32.101 --> 00:00:34.740
<v Speaker 1>languages that have no family </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever.</v>

11
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.030
<v Speaker 1>Those are called language isolates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A language isolate as far as we know,</v>

12
00:00:39.031 --> 00:00:42.240
<v Speaker 1>has no genetic relationship with any </v>
<v Speaker 1>other language.</v>

13
00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:43.074
<v Speaker 1>That means that it does not descend from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same ancestor language as any other </v>

14
00:00:46.681 --> 00:00:47.514
<v Speaker 1>language that we know of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are basically a language family </v>

15
00:00:50.101 --> 00:00:51.570
<v Speaker 1>with only one member.</v>

16
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:52.553
<v Speaker 1>Some commonly known language isolates </v>
<v Speaker 1>are the Basque language which is spoken </v>

17
00:00:55.591 --> 00:00:59.730
<v Speaker 1>in parts of France and Spain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also the new language which is spoken in</v>

18
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.610
<v Speaker 1>Hokkaido and northern Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people say Korean,</v>

19
00:01:02.611 --> 00:01:03.444
<v Speaker 1>although that one is disputed and also </v>
<v Speaker 1>some native American languages as well </v>

20
00:01:07.051 --> 00:01:09.450
<v Speaker 1>as some languages on the island of New </v>
<v Speaker 1>Guinea.</v>

21
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:10.403
<v Speaker 1>New Guinea happens to be the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>linguistically diverse place on the </v>

22
00:01:12.661 --> 00:01:14.280
<v Speaker 1>planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to know more about it,</v>

23
00:01:14.281 --> 00:01:18.170
<v Speaker 1>check out this video right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are there language isolates?</v>

24
00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.043
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one possible reason is that that </v>

25
00:01:20.341 --> 00:01:23.940
<v Speaker 1>language used to belong to a family that</v>
<v Speaker 1>had numerous languages in it,</v>

26
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.983
<v Speaker 1>but that one particular language became </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominant and replaced all of the others </v>

27
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:30.623
<v Speaker 1>or maybe all the other languages in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>family were replaced by a different </v>

28
00:01:33.781 --> 00:01:34.860
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

29
00:01:34.861 --> 00:01:38.760
<v Speaker 1>a language of a conquering army,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one particular group refused to give</v>

30
00:01:38.761 --> 00:01:41.430
<v Speaker 1>up and their language became a language </v>
<v Speaker 1>isolate.</v>

31
00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:42.463
<v Speaker 1>It is possible for a new language </v>
<v Speaker 1>isolate to arise if that community of </v>

32
00:01:45.901 --> 00:01:46.734
<v Speaker 1>people is completely separated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely isolated from other </v>

33
00:01:49.291 --> 00:01:51.780
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's because children have the ability</v>

34
00:01:51.781 --> 00:01:55.590
<v Speaker 1>to spontaneously create new language in </v>
<v Speaker 1>these modern times.</v>

35
00:01:55.591 --> 00:01:58.230
<v Speaker 1>That happens most often with sign </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>

36
00:01:58.231 --> 00:01:59.064
<v Speaker 1>There have been numerous cases around </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world of children in deaf schools </v>

37
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:02.693
<v Speaker 1>spontaneously creating new sign </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages that are completely unrelated </v>

38
00:02:05.761 --> 00:02:07.110
<v Speaker 1>to any others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the world,</v>

39
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.003
<v Speaker 1>some linguists say that if you took a </v>
<v Speaker 1>group of infants and you raised them in </v>

40
00:02:10.711 --> 00:02:11.544
<v Speaker 1>an environment with no language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they would spontaneously create </v>

41
00:02:14.011 --> 00:02:14.844
<v Speaker 1>their own language isolate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is just a quick video to introduce </v>

42
00:02:17.311 --> 00:02:18.144
<v Speaker 1>that linguistic concept that some people</v>
<v Speaker 1>have been talking about in response to </v>

43
00:02:20.971 --> 00:02:24.480
<v Speaker 1>some of my videos in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one about Japanese and Korean.</v>

44
00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.850
<v Speaker 1>If you have any comments about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>topic,</v>

45
00:02:26.851 --> 00:02:30.120
<v Speaker 1>leave them down below,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but stay tuned for another feature video</v>

46
00:02:30.121 --> 00:02:32.070
<v Speaker 1>coming soon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for watching.</v>

47
00:02:32.071 --> 00:02:32.990
<v Speaker 1>Have a nice.</v>
