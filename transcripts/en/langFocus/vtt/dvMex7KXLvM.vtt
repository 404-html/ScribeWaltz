<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Lange focus channel.</v>

2
00:00:03.001 --> 00:00:03.834
<v Speaker 1>My name is Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today I want to talk about knowing your </v>

3
00:00:06.421 --> 00:00:07.254
<v Speaker 1>learning style.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people rely on other people or on </v>

4
00:00:10.321 --> 00:00:14.070
<v Speaker 1>their materials to teach them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I want you to be empowered and to be</v>

5
00:00:14.071 --> 00:00:16.170
<v Speaker 1>able to direct your own language </v>
<v Speaker 1>learning.</v>

6
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.160
<v Speaker 1>That's why today we are going to look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>your learning style and how to use it to</v>

7
00:00:20.161 --> 00:00:23.250
<v Speaker 1>learn more efficiently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Different people learn differently.</v>

8
00:00:23.251 --> 00:00:24.084
<v Speaker 1>We all have a unique learning style that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is based on the type of sensory </v>

9
00:00:26.851 --> 00:00:27.684
<v Speaker 1>information that we prefer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These kinds of sensory information are </v>

10
00:00:30.631 --> 00:00:33.390
<v Speaker 1>called learning modalities and there are</v>
<v Speaker 1>four of them.</v>

11
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.140
<v Speaker 1>Some people say three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to say for they are visual,</v>

12
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.740
<v Speaker 1>auditory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reading and writing and kinesthetic.</v>

13
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.670
<v Speaker 1>You can remember those learning </v>
<v Speaker 1>modalities based on the acronym Mark V,</v>

14
00:00:44.671 --> 00:00:48.600
<v Speaker 1>a r k students generally have a dominant</v>
<v Speaker 1>modality,</v>

15
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.360
<v Speaker 1>but they do use a combination of all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>different modalities.</v>

16
00:00:51.361 --> 00:00:52.920
<v Speaker 1>Some people will say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

17
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.933
<v Speaker 1>I'm a visual learner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but really what they mean is that I am </v>

18
00:00:55.861 --> 00:00:59.520
<v Speaker 1>primarily a visual learner with some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the other modalities as well.</v>

19
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:00.683
<v Speaker 1>There are some people who don't really </v>
<v Speaker 1>have one strongly dominant modality and </v>

20
00:01:04.321 --> 00:01:05.250
<v Speaker 1>they call those people.</v>
