00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.043
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and </v>

2
00:00:03.061 --> 00:00:03.894
<v Speaker 1>my name is Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today we'll be discussing the question </v>

3
00:00:06.331 --> 00:00:10.680
<v Speaker 1>how similar our metropolitan French and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Quebec French or Quebecois.</v>

4
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:11.783
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how similar is the French spoken in </v>

5
00:00:13.261 --> 00:00:14.094
<v Speaker 1>France to the French spoken in Quebec.</v>
<v Speaker 1>French is one of the world's major </v>

6
00:00:17.131 --> 00:00:17.964
<v Speaker 1>languages and it's spoken in dozens of </v>
<v Speaker 1>different countries and everywhere that </v>

7
00:00:20.971 --> 00:00:21.804
<v Speaker 1>it's spoken,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the standard variety or the formal </v>

8
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:24.263
<v Speaker 1>variety that's learned at school and </v>
<v Speaker 1>used in the media is essentially the </v>

9
00:00:26.821 --> 00:00:27.654
<v Speaker 1>same as metropolitan French based on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Parisian variety of French in informal </v>

10
00:00:32.041 --> 00:00:32.790
<v Speaker 1>speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

11
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.540
<v Speaker 1>there is some variation with local </v>
<v Speaker 1>differences in accents and vocabulary.</v>

12
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:37.523
<v Speaker 1>There's one major variety of French that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is particularly distinct from </v>

13
00:00:40.321 --> 00:00:43.200
<v Speaker 1>Metropolitan French,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that is the French chef Quebec,</v>

14
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.170
<v Speaker 1>a culturally distinct French speaking </v>
<v Speaker 1>province in Canada.</v>

15
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.860
<v Speaker 1>French speakers from France often say </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they have trouble understanding the</v>

16
00:00:49.861 --> 00:00:51.150
<v Speaker 1>French spoken in Quebec.</v>

17
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.100
<v Speaker 1>I should point out that the formal </v>
<v Speaker 1>variety of French Houston,</v>

18
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.090
<v Speaker 1>Quebec is virtually identical to </v>
<v Speaker 1>metropolitan French.</v>

19
00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.043
<v Speaker 1>The differences lie in the informal </v>
<v Speaker 1>varieties of Quebec and an informal </v>

20
00:01:01.141 --> 00:01:01.974
<v Speaker 1>speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There can be a considerable amount of </v>

21
00:01:03.241 --> 00:01:04.074
<v Speaker 1>difference,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but why is Quebec French distinct from </v>

22
00:01:05.851 --> 00:01:09.060
<v Speaker 1>Metropolitan French?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason lies in the settlement of new</v>

23
00:01:09.061 --> 00:01:12.090
<v Speaker 1>France and the later isolation of Quebec</v>
<v Speaker 1>from France.</v>

24
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.103
<v Speaker 1>New France was an area in North America </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was colonized by France before the </v>

25
00:01:16.741 --> 00:01:18.960
<v Speaker 1>creation of Canada and the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States,</v>

26
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.440
<v Speaker 1>the first settlers in new France.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not mainly from the Paris area,</v>

27
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.070
<v Speaker 1>but from regions like Normandy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Brittany were regional sister.</v>

28
00:01:26.071 --> 00:01:30.390
<v Speaker 1>Languages of French lung doyle were </v>
<v Speaker 1>spoken rather than French itself,</v>

29
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.690
<v Speaker 1>but since French settlers were </v>
<v Speaker 1>outnumbered by English settlers,</v>

30
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.470
<v Speaker 1>the King of France,</v>
<v Speaker 1>King Louis the 14th sent female settlers</v>

31
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.333
<v Speaker 1>mainly from the Paris area to help </v>
<v Speaker 1>bolster their numbers through marriage </v>

32
00:01:40.861 --> 00:01:41.694
<v Speaker 1>and childbirth.</v>

33
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.280
<v Speaker 1>Since these women were mainly from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Paris area,</v>

34
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.950
<v Speaker 1>they brought with them their Parisian </v>
<v Speaker 1>variety of French,</v>

35
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.873
<v Speaker 1>which contributed to the decline of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>regional languages and the adoption of </v>

36
00:01:50.941 --> 00:01:51.774
<v Speaker 1>French among the settler population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course the interaction between </v>

37
00:01:54.871 --> 00:01:59.100
<v Speaker 1>speakers of different regional languages</v>
<v Speaker 1>encouraged the use of French as a Lingua</v>

38
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.090
<v Speaker 1>Franca.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a result.</v>

39
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.983
<v Speaker 1>The language that developed in new </v>
<v Speaker 1>France was similar to the language </v>

40
00:02:03.421 --> 00:02:04.254
<v Speaker 1>spoken by the king and the aristocracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but was also influenced by the regional </v>

41
00:02:07.771 --> 00:02:08.604
<v Speaker 1>languages of the settlers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The French language became adopted </v>

42
00:02:10.981 --> 00:02:12.810
<v Speaker 1>throughout the various regions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>France.</v>

43
00:02:12.811 --> 00:02:16.020
<v Speaker 1>Later after the French Revolution of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>late 18th century,</v>

44
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.520
<v Speaker 1>the variety of French that became the </v>
<v Speaker 1>new widespread standard language was not</v>

45
00:02:20.521 --> 00:02:22.440
<v Speaker 1>the French of the king and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>aristocracy,</v>

46
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.393
<v Speaker 1>but rather the French of the bourgeois </v>
<v Speaker 1>class who led the revolution prior to </v>

47
00:02:27.031 --> 00:02:30.090
<v Speaker 1>the French Revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>New France had already been conquered by</v>

48
00:02:30.091 --> 00:02:33.960
<v Speaker 1>the British in 1760 and it's elite had </v>
<v Speaker 1>returned to France.</v>

49
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.883
<v Speaker 1>The British soon decided to allow the </v>
<v Speaker 1>French speaking population in what is </v>

50
00:02:37.861 --> 00:02:38.694
<v Speaker 1>now Quebec to continue using their </v>
<v Speaker 1>language as a way to prevent them from </v>

51
00:02:41.731 --> 00:02:44.310
<v Speaker 1>joining the American revolution against </v>
<v Speaker 1>the British,</v>

52
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.530
<v Speaker 1>which was taking place to the south.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come back,</v>

53
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.160
<v Speaker 1>therefore remained under British rule,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but was isolated from France.</v>

54
00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.640
<v Speaker 1>The French language in Quebec began </v>
<v Speaker 1>developing in its own direction.</v>

55
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.550
<v Speaker 1>While the French spoken in France </v>
<v Speaker 1>developed in its own direction.</v>

56
00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:57.603
<v Speaker 1>The vocabulary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The vocabulary of Quebec French differs </v>

57
00:02:59.891 --> 00:03:02.350
<v Speaker 1>from that of Metropolitan French in </v>
<v Speaker 1>several ways.</v>

58
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.393
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the two varieties of French have taken </v>

59
00:03:04.961 --> 00:03:07.720
<v Speaker 1>in loan words from English during </v>
<v Speaker 1>different time periods.</v>

60
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:08.673
<v Speaker 1>The French of Quebec was infused with </v>
<v Speaker 1>English vocabulary during the period </v>

61
00:03:11.471 --> 00:03:16.210
<v Speaker 1>from 1850 to 1960 for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the word for job in Quebec,</v>

62
00:03:16.211 --> 00:03:21.211
<v Speaker 1>French there is in metropolitan French </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Quebec,</v>

63
00:03:22.121 --> 00:03:26.050
<v Speaker 1>French weird and Metropolitan French </v>
<v Speaker 1>visa.</v>

64
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:27.483
<v Speaker 1>In Quebec,</v>
<v Speaker 1>French there's chum meaning a male </v>

65
00:03:29.651 --> 00:03:30.484
<v Speaker 1>friend or a boyfriend and in </v>
<v Speaker 1>metropolitan French that would be me or </v>

66
00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.150
<v Speaker 1>the coupon in Quebec,</v>
<v Speaker 1>French,</v>

67
00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.960
<v Speaker 1>there's fun in metropolitan French,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a museum.</v>

68
00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.873
<v Speaker 1>Fun also appears in the phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a direct translation of the </v>

69
00:03:47.081 --> 00:03:50.140
<v Speaker 1>English expression to have fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Metropolitan French,</v>

70
00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.003
<v Speaker 1>it would be send Musey expressions like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this are called calcs or lone </v>

71
00:03:54.881 --> 00:03:55.714
<v Speaker 1>translations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another example is this is translated </v>

72
00:03:59.411 --> 00:04:03.520
<v Speaker 1>from English that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In metropolitan friendship would be sad.</v>

73
00:04:03.521 --> 00:04:08.260
<v Speaker 1>You songs and then Quebec French people </v>
<v Speaker 1>say to me,</v>

74
00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:09.123
<v Speaker 1>you're welcome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in metropolitan French they would </v>

75
00:04:10.841 --> 00:04:12.100
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do the young.</v>

76
00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.640
<v Speaker 1>The old venue means welcome in all </v>
<v Speaker 1>varieties of French,</v>

77
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.190
<v Speaker 1>but not your welcome in response to </v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>

78
00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:21.790
<v Speaker 1>Note that these are informal Quebecois </v>
<v Speaker 1>words,</v>

79
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.580
<v Speaker 1>which are not considered proper and </v>
<v Speaker 1>formal Quebec French,</v>

80
00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.010
<v Speaker 1>which mirrors the standards of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Metropolitan French.</v>

81
00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:28.473
<v Speaker 1>Since 1960 there have been French </v>
<v Speaker 1>language protection laws in Quebec and </v>

82
00:04:32.021 --> 00:04:34.420
<v Speaker 1>the general distaste towards English </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems.</v>

83
00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:36.190
<v Speaker 1>Metropolitan French,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the other hand,</v>

84
00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.530
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have the same protective </v>
<v Speaker 1>attitude,</v>

85
00:04:38.531 --> 00:04:41.650
<v Speaker 1>and in recent decades has been more </v>
<v Speaker 1>influenced by English,</v>

86
00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.520
<v Speaker 1>so it contains recent English loan words</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are not used in Quebec.</v>

87
00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:47.740
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in metropolitan French,</v>

88
00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.840
<v Speaker 1>they say email,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in Quebec,</v>

89
00:04:49.841 --> 00:04:51.130
<v Speaker 1>French they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

90
00:04:51.131 --> 00:04:54.010
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Metropolitan French,</v>

91
00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:59.050
<v Speaker 1>there's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Quebec they say stop signs in France,</v>

92
00:04:59.621 --> 00:05:00.690
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop.</v>

93
00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:02.890
<v Speaker 1>This is not really a part of the French </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

94
00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.260
<v Speaker 1>It's just an international used street </v>
<v Speaker 1>sign.</v>

95
00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:06.153
<v Speaker 1>But in Quebec,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sign say another aspect of </v>

96
00:05:09.611 --> 00:05:13.600
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary that differs is that there </v>
<v Speaker 1>are some words or expressions in Quebec,</v>

97
00:05:13.601 --> 00:05:14.434
<v Speaker 1>French that seem older or more </v>
<v Speaker 1>traditional to speakers of metropolitan </v>

98
00:05:17.321 --> 00:05:18.154
<v Speaker 1>French.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Quebecois word for shoes is in </v>

99
00:05:21.461 --> 00:05:22.294
<v Speaker 1>metropolitan French.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's detial sue the Quebecois word for </v>

100
00:05:25.691 --> 00:05:28.150
<v Speaker 1>car or Shell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In France,</v>

101
00:05:28.151 --> 00:05:31.150
<v Speaker 1>it's [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>In France,</v>

102
00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:36.270
<v Speaker 1>Shar means tank as in tank of war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another example is the way to say I miss</v>

103
00:05:36.761 --> 00:05:40.570
<v Speaker 1>you in Quebec,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's [inaudible] in France.</v>

104
00:05:40.571 --> 00:05:41.404
<v Speaker 1>That would sound rather old fashion and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way people would usually say it is </v>

105
00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:45.533
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

106
00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:47.753
<v Speaker 1>The French of Quebec also contains </v>
<v Speaker 1>numerous slang expressions and swear </v>

107
00:05:50.741 --> 00:05:52.930
<v Speaker 1>words that are taken from the Catholic </v>
<v Speaker 1>religion.</v>

108
00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:55.540
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps the most famous where word of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Quebec is.</v>

109
00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.930
<v Speaker 1>Others include car lists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning chalice,</v>

110
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.033
<v Speaker 1>a c meaning host or communion bread.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These words are only offensive and </v>

111
00:06:04.881 --> 00:06:08.030
<v Speaker 1>Quebec and nowhere else in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Francophone world as far as I know,</v>

112
00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.890
<v Speaker 1>and the French of Quebec has also just </v>
<v Speaker 1>developed some of its own vocabulary and</v>

113
00:06:12.891 --> 00:06:14.270
<v Speaker 1>expressions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

114
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:19.300
<v Speaker 1>to go shopping in Quebec,</v>
<v Speaker 1>friendships in metropolitan French,</v>

115
00:06:19.371 --> 00:06:21.500
<v Speaker 1>it's cld,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kooks Clg,</v>

116
00:06:21.501 --> 00:06:22.334
<v Speaker 1>shipping grammar written French in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Quebec is grammatically identical to </v>

117
00:06:26.901 --> 00:06:27.734
<v Speaker 1>metropolitan French,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but an informal speech you might hear </v>

118
00:06:29.871 --> 00:06:30.704
<v Speaker 1>some differences in grammar too is used </v>
<v Speaker 1>after verbs as a yes or no question </v>

119
00:06:34.461 --> 00:06:37.400
<v Speaker 1>marker that's in blown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means,</v>

120
00:06:37.401 --> 00:06:40.300
<v Speaker 1>do you have a girlfriend in metropolitan</v>
<v Speaker 1>French [inaudible]?</v>

121
00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:41.410
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

122
00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:42.733
<v Speaker 1>Notice here that is being used as a yes </v>
<v Speaker 1>or no question marker and not as a </v>

123
00:06:46.521 --> 00:06:47.354
<v Speaker 1>pronoun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also notice the Quebecois word for </v>

124
00:06:49.041 --> 00:06:49.874
<v Speaker 1>girlfriend bloomed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means is it ready in metropolitan </v>

125
00:06:54.711 --> 00:06:56.120
<v Speaker 1>French.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be sip.</v>

126
00:06:56.121 --> 00:07:00.560
<v Speaker 1>Sam Is cusip saying here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>notice that the subject is third person.</v>

127
00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:03.620
<v Speaker 1>To be clear too is nothing but a </v>
<v Speaker 1>question marker here.</v>

128
00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:04.483
<v Speaker 1>It's not the second person Pronoun too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also used for emphasis or </v>

129
00:07:08.241 --> 00:07:09.530
<v Speaker 1>exclamation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

130
00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.100
<v Speaker 1>that's so shocking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seats.</v>

131
00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:15.740
<v Speaker 1>You should come next.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Quebec,</v>

132
00:07:15.741 --> 00:07:16.574
<v Speaker 1>French cook is used as the relative </v>
<v Speaker 1>pronoun more often than in metropolitan </v>

133
00:07:20.151 --> 00:07:21.600
<v Speaker 1>French.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just Shush.</v>

134
00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:25.310
<v Speaker 1>I leave Casey business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means I'm looking for the book that</v>

135
00:07:25.311 --> 00:07:26.144
<v Speaker 1>I need in metropolitan French.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This would be [inaudible] and in a </v>

136
00:07:32.061 --> 00:07:32.894
<v Speaker 1>sentence with an embedded question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Metropolitan French you use a </v>

137
00:07:35.601 --> 00:07:36.434
<v Speaker 1>relative pronoun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in Quebec French the interrogative </v>

138
00:07:38.541 --> 00:07:43.160
<v Speaker 1>pronoun is used.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should I say this means I do what I want</v>

139
00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:48.520
<v Speaker 1>in metropolitan French [inaudible] next </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Quebec French.</v>

140
00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:50.113
<v Speaker 1>The explicit subject of a sentence is </v>
<v Speaker 1>often said as a tag with a pronoun as </v>

141
00:07:53.691 --> 00:07:56.330
<v Speaker 1>the subject in the main clause.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

142
00:07:56.570 --> 00:08:01.570
<v Speaker 1>mall bus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means my boss makes me so angry.</v>

143
00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:03.013
<v Speaker 1>Notice how the subject,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my boss is set aside at the beginning </v>

144
00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:06.223
<v Speaker 1>separate from the main clause and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Pronoun e which is a contraction of </v>

145
00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:12.800
<v Speaker 1>eel appears in the main clause in </v>
<v Speaker 1>metropolitan French.</v>

146
00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:17.830
<v Speaker 1>This would be in Quebec,</v>
<v Speaker 1>French pla towards mound.</v>

147
00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:23.360
<v Speaker 1>This means his plan is to travel around </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

148
00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:27.310
<v Speaker 1>In metropolitan French it would be so </v>
<v Speaker 1>pushy ewg.</v>

149
00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:29.293
<v Speaker 1>This type of tag is also used in </v>
<v Speaker 1>metropolitan French but as much more </v>

150
00:08:32.391 --> 00:08:33.740
<v Speaker 1>common in Quebec,</v>
<v Speaker 1>French.</v>

151
00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:38.240
<v Speaker 1>Next there are some differences in </v>
<v Speaker 1>imperative forms in Quebec French.</v>

152
00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:44.620
<v Speaker 1>This means tell me or tell it to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Metropolitan French denim you can see</v>

153
00:08:45.501 --> 00:08:50.501
<v Speaker 1>that the object Pronoun La is positioned</v>
<v Speaker 1>differently and now the negative form in</v>

154
00:08:52.821 --> 00:08:57.120
<v Speaker 1>metropolitan French in the deeper you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can see that in the negative,</v>

155
00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:58.560
<v Speaker 1>the syntax is quite different.</v>

156
00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:03.000
<v Speaker 1>In Metropolitan French,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the object Pronoun Ma is used instead of</v>

157
00:09:03.001 --> 00:09:06.930
<v Speaker 1>the French emphatic Pronoun Wa often </v>
<v Speaker 1>pronounced where in Quebec,</v>

158
00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:11.100
<v Speaker 1>and it comes before the verb as does the</v>
<v Speaker 1>object Pronoun Look in Quebec,</v>

159
00:09:11.101 --> 00:09:11.934
<v Speaker 1>French,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they come after the verb as they do in </v>

160
00:09:13.591 --> 00:09:14.424
<v Speaker 1>the affirmative accent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably the biggest difference between </v>

161
00:09:18.061 --> 00:09:18.894
<v Speaker 1>the French of Quebec and Metropolitan </v>
<v Speaker 1>France simply lies in accent without </v>

162
00:09:22.261 --> 00:09:24.660
<v Speaker 1>previous exposure to the French spoken </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Quebec.</v>

163
00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:27.750
<v Speaker 1>French speakers from Europe typically </v>
<v Speaker 1>have trouble understanding it,</v>

164
00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:28.643
<v Speaker 1>and this differs depending on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>socioeconomic background and the region </v>

165
00:09:31.741 --> 00:09:32.574
<v Speaker 1>of the speaker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The consonants are not so different for </v>

166
00:09:34.501 --> 00:09:35.334
<v Speaker 1>the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are some differences in </v>

167
00:09:37.291 --> 00:09:40.490
<v Speaker 1>Quebec,</v>
<v Speaker 1>French before the vowels e and Oo,</v>

168
00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:41.693
<v Speaker 1>the consonants to enter become enza gg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas in metropolitan French it's </v>

169
00:09:48.271 --> 00:09:49.104
<v Speaker 1>pronounced two d.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are several different rotate </v>

170
00:09:52.021 --> 00:09:55.800
<v Speaker 1>sounds used throughout Quebec,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including trill sounds as opposed to the</v>

171
00:09:55.801 --> 00:09:58.140
<v Speaker 1>Uvula fricative of Metropolitan French.</v>

172
00:09:58.290 --> 00:09:59.123
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is also true in France where some </v>

173
00:10:00.811 --> 00:10:01.644
<v Speaker 1>regional accents have trills rather than</v>
<v Speaker 1>fricatives and in Quebec in formal </v>

174
00:10:05.341 --> 00:10:09.210
<v Speaker 1>speech and in many areas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the uvular fricative is also used.</v>

175
00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:13.200
<v Speaker 1>So the situation in Quebec and Francis </v>
<v Speaker 1>similar except that in France,</v>

176
00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:18.000
<v Speaker 1>the shift towards the uvular fricative </v>
<v Speaker 1>is more advanced vowels.</v>

177
00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:21.060
<v Speaker 1>One difference is that nasal vowels are </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite different.</v>

178
00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:22.081
<v Speaker 1>In Quebec,</v>
<v Speaker 1>French,</v>

179
00:10:22.081 --> 00:10:22.914
<v Speaker 1>there's CAF,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in metropolitan French there's </v>

180
00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:28.710
<v Speaker 1>another difference is that in Quebec,</v>
<v Speaker 1>French,</v>

181
00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:32.640
<v Speaker 1>long vowels and nasal vowels become </v>
<v Speaker 1>diphthongs in open syllables.</v>

182
00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:35.210
<v Speaker 1>So in Quebec,</v>
<v Speaker 1>French we have fights,</v>

183
00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:39.090
<v Speaker 1>but in metropolitan French there's sit </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Quebec,</v>

184
00:10:39.091 --> 00:10:42.390
<v Speaker 1>French,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have pi in metropolitan French,</v>

185
00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:43.253
<v Speaker 1>it's damn related to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quebec French retain some long vowels </v>

186
00:10:47.551 --> 00:10:50.850
<v Speaker 1>from older French that have become short</v>
<v Speaker 1>in metropolitan French.</v>

187
00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:53.400
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in metropolitan French,</v>

188
00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:57.040
<v Speaker 1>these two words sound the same mate </v>
<v Speaker 1>mate,</v>

189
00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:58.530
<v Speaker 1>but in Quebec,</v>
<v Speaker 1>French,</v>

190
00:10:58.531 --> 00:10:59.364
<v Speaker 1>they don't.</v>

191
00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:03.690
<v Speaker 1>My Net,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are just a couple of examples,</v>

192
00:11:03.691 --> 00:11:06.360
<v Speaker 1>but there are numerous distinctions like</v>
<v Speaker 1>these intervals.</v>

193
00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:09.810
<v Speaker 1>Some words also become contracted in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Quebec,</v>

194
00:11:09.811 --> 00:11:11.220
<v Speaker 1>French,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

195
00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:14.580
<v Speaker 1>sue meaning on followed by a definite </v>
<v Speaker 1>article,</v>

196
00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:15.443
<v Speaker 1>gets contracted sill say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now let's look at a few sentences to </v>

197
00:11:23.011 --> 00:11:24.360
<v Speaker 1>compare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the sentence,</v>

198
00:11:24.361 --> 00:11:28.170
<v Speaker 1>meaning I fell in love with her because </v>
<v Speaker 1>she's beautiful in Quebec.</v>

199
00:11:28.171 --> 00:11:29.004
<v Speaker 1>French.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She tell him down that I called Kenny </v>

200
00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:36.630
<v Speaker 1>van and in metropolitan French she vm </v>
<v Speaker 1>Udin Pascali Bill.</v>

201
00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:40.970
<v Speaker 1>Here we can see a quebecois expression </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tome Bay on the Moon [inaudible],</v>

202
00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:44.400
<v Speaker 1>which is a calc of the English </v>
<v Speaker 1>expression fall in love with,</v>

203
00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:45.443
<v Speaker 1>and here we see two different phrases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning because I called Tsca is an </v>

204
00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:49.553
<v Speaker 1>older phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is obsolete and metropolitan </v>

205
00:11:51.301 --> 00:11:53.190
<v Speaker 1>French,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's still used in Quebec.</v>

206
00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:54.593
<v Speaker 1>Another pair of sentences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This time they mean I want to go out </v>

207
00:11:57.131 --> 00:11:58.570
<v Speaker 1>with my friends on the weekend</v>

208
00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:01.540
<v Speaker 2>in Quebec,</v>
<v Speaker 2>French off to Hong Gang,</v>

209
00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:02.550
<v Speaker 2>often salmon</v>

210
00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:08.260
<v Speaker 1>and in metropolitan French [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 1>weekend in the Quebec French sentence we</v>

211
00:12:08.721 --> 00:12:09.554
<v Speaker 1>see on gun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means with a group of friends or </v>

212
00:12:11.721 --> 00:12:12.554
<v Speaker 1>colleagues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This phrase is strictly a Quebecois </v>

213
00:12:14.271 --> 00:12:15.104
<v Speaker 1>phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when Metropolitan French you'd say </v>

214
00:12:16.581 --> 00:12:17.740
<v Speaker 1>something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>evict me.</v>

215
00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:20.820
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Next we see the phrase of fantasy man,</v>

216
00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:23.870
<v Speaker 1>which means on the weekend in </v>
<v Speaker 1>metropolitan French,</v>

217
00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:27.320
<v Speaker 1>the usual term is the weekend or in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>context,</v>

218
00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:28.183
<v Speaker 1>so weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is an [inaudible] that has not </v>

219
00:12:30.281 --> 00:12:31.114
<v Speaker 1>entered Quebec French due to its </v>
<v Speaker 1>language protection efforts in </v>

220
00:12:33.761 --> 00:12:35.890
<v Speaker 1>metropolitan French.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone might say,</v>

221
00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:36.813
<v Speaker 1>fend to some man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to refer to the end of the workweek </v>

222
00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:42.483
<v Speaker 1>like Thursday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Friday before the weekend.</v>

223
00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:44.820
<v Speaker 1>Now let's look at one last pair of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sentences.</v>

224
00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:48.360
<v Speaker 1>This time they mean I'm going to park </v>
<v Speaker 1>the car here and ride my bike</v>

225
00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:50.240
<v Speaker 2>in Quebec,</v>
<v Speaker 2>French.</v>

226
00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:52.560
<v Speaker 2>Should we be back?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll show you see your motives</v>

227
00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:57.580
<v Speaker 1>and Metropolitan French choosy guide of </v>
<v Speaker 1>which you receive a porn movie loo.</v>

228
00:12:57.930 --> 00:12:58.763
<v Speaker 1>Here we see a uniquely Quebecois phrase </v>
<v Speaker 1>park in the Shah with the verb that </v>

229
00:13:03.181 --> 00:13:04.014
<v Speaker 1>comes from the English word park and </v>
<v Speaker 1>again we see the word Sha meaning car </v>

230
00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:11.420
<v Speaker 1>and notice that the words for bicycle </v>
<v Speaker 1>are different in Quebec,</v>

231
00:13:11.421 --> 00:13:12.254
<v Speaker 1>the common word is BC clit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This word isn't a lone word from </v>

232
00:13:14.841 --> 00:13:15.860
<v Speaker 1>English.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

233
00:13:15.861 --> 00:13:18.680
<v Speaker 1>it appeared in French before the word </v>
<v Speaker 1>bicycle appeared in English.</v>

234
00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:19.663
<v Speaker 1>It's a standard French word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but is generally considered old </v>

235
00:13:21.801 --> 00:13:25.900
<v Speaker 1>fashioned to speakers of metropolitan </v>
<v Speaker 1>French who mainly use the word veilleux.</v>

236
00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:28.223
<v Speaker 1>As we've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the French of Quebec has a number of </v>

237
00:13:29.791 --> 00:13:32.820
<v Speaker 1>different features that distinguish it </v>
<v Speaker 1>from metropolitan French,</v>

238
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.390
<v Speaker 1>but it seems to me that people sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 1>exaggerate these differences.</v>

239
00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:38.700
<v Speaker 1>There are significant differences in </v>
<v Speaker 1>accent,</v>

240
00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:39.593
<v Speaker 1>but that seems like something that would</v>
<v Speaker 1>cease to be much of a problem with </v>

241
00:13:41.941 --> 00:13:43.530
<v Speaker 1>significant exposure to it.</v>

242
00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:44.633
<v Speaker 1>In terms of vocabulary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quebec has its own informal expressions </v>

243
00:13:47.641 --> 00:13:48.474
<v Speaker 1>and slang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so do other French speaking areas </v>

244
00:13:50.071 --> 00:13:50.904
<v Speaker 1>including Paris in terms of grammar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are some little things here and </v>

245
00:13:53.431 --> 00:13:57.150
<v Speaker 1>there but nothing too shocking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course formal French in Quebec is</v>

246
00:13:57.151 --> 00:14:00.780
<v Speaker 1>very close to formal French in France,</v>
<v Speaker 1>albeit with a different accent.</v>

247
00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:04.410
<v Speaker 1>The question of the day for native </v>
<v Speaker 1>speakers of French from Quebec,</v>

248
00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:05.333
<v Speaker 1>from your point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how different is your variety of French </v>

249
00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:11.620
<v Speaker 1>from the French spoken in Europe and for</v>
<v Speaker 1>native speakers of French from Europe?</v>

250
00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:12.603
<v Speaker 1>How well can you understand the French </v>
<v Speaker 1>spoken in Quebec and for learners of </v>

251
00:14:16.161 --> 00:14:16.994
<v Speaker 1>French,</v>
<v Speaker 1>assuming that you're learning </v>

252
00:14:17.871 --> 00:14:18.704
<v Speaker 1>metropolitan French,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think of the French spoken </v>

253
00:14:20.901 --> 00:14:23.120
<v Speaker 1>in Quebec?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it hard to make sense of?</v>

254
00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:25.740
<v Speaker 1>Be sure to follow Lang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>focus on facebook,</v>

255
00:14:25.741 --> 00:14:26.574
<v Speaker 1>twitter and instagram and once again </v>
