00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:01.143
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and </v>

2
00:00:03.311 --> 00:00:06.580
<v Speaker 1>my name is Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today we'll be answering the question,</v>

3
00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.490
<v Speaker 1>how are British English and American </v>
<v Speaker 1>English different?</v>

4
00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:10.503
<v Speaker 1>One of the most commonly asked questions</v>
<v Speaker 1>by learners of English and hopefully </v>

5
00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:14.643
<v Speaker 1>native speakers of English.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll learn a thing or two from this </v>

6
00:00:16.331 --> 00:00:17.164
<v Speaker 1>video as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The truth is that both British English </v>

7
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.760
<v Speaker 1>and American English have numerous </v>
<v Speaker 1>varieties,</v>

8
00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.490
<v Speaker 1>in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>various accents and dialects.</v>

9
00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:25.413
<v Speaker 1>So for the main part of this video I'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>try to focus on the most standard non </v>

10
00:00:28.631 --> 00:00:31.570
<v Speaker 1>regional variety of each one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Disclaimer,</v>

11
00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm not American,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually Canadian,</v>

12
00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:34.773
<v Speaker 1>but I'm confident that we will someday </v>
<v Speaker 1>be Americans after the invasion </v>

13
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.560
<v Speaker 1>standard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Canadian English is very,</v>

14
00:00:40.561 --> 00:00:41.394
<v Speaker 1>very close to general American English,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I will say the American English </v>

15
00:00:44.491 --> 00:00:45.324
<v Speaker 1>samples myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless there's some specific need to </v>

16
00:00:47.311 --> 00:00:50.220
<v Speaker 1>distinguish between American and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Canadian pronunciation.</v>

17
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:51.563
<v Speaker 1>There are several ways in which British </v>
<v Speaker 1>English and American English are </v>

18
00:00:53.851 --> 00:00:56.160
<v Speaker 1>different vocabulary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>accent,</v>

19
00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.590
<v Speaker 1>spelling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the grammar vocabulary.</v>

20
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.960
<v Speaker 1>Let me just throw a bunch of examples at</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

21
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.350
<v Speaker 1>In the U s people generally say garbage </v>
<v Speaker 1>or trash.</v>

22
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.050
<v Speaker 1>While in the UK they generally say </v>
<v Speaker 1>rubbish.</v>

23
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.770
<v Speaker 1>Both literally and figuratively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The game was rubbish.</v>

24
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:12.383
<v Speaker 1>Americans go on vacation while Brits go </v>
<v Speaker 1>on holiday and that's also possible in </v>

25
00:01:16.501 --> 00:01:17.334
<v Speaker 1>American English.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the u s people rent apartments while </v>

26
00:01:20.221 --> 00:01:25.221
<v Speaker 1>in the UK they rent flats in the u s if </v>
<v Speaker 1>your apartment is that street level,</v>

27
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.530
<v Speaker 1>then you live on the first floor and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>person above you.</v>

28
00:01:28.531 --> 00:01:30.780
<v Speaker 1>It lives on the second floor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the UK,</v>

29
00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:31.643
<v Speaker 1>you live on the ground floor and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>person above you lives on the first </v>

30
00:01:34.261 --> 00:01:35.094
<v Speaker 1>floor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that person above you is unable or </v>

31
00:01:37.981 --> 00:01:42.870
<v Speaker 1>just too lazy to take the stairs in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>u s they'd take the elevator in the UK,</v>

32
00:01:42.871 --> 00:01:46.590
<v Speaker 1>they'd take the lift.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're bored at home in the U s you</v>

33
00:01:46.591 --> 00:01:50.220
<v Speaker 1>might turn on the TV while in the UK you</v>
<v Speaker 1>would turn on the telly.</v>

34
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.103
<v Speaker 1>When you step outside of your building </v>
<v Speaker 1>to go for a walk in the u s you might </v>

35
00:01:55.141 --> 00:02:00.141
<v Speaker 1>walk on the sidewalk while in the UK you</v>
<v Speaker 1>walk on the pavement and if you're tired</v>

36
00:02:00.511 --> 00:02:03.090
<v Speaker 1>of walking in the u s you might take the</v>
<v Speaker 1>subway.</v>

37
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.290
<v Speaker 1>In the UK,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you take the underground in the U S it's</v>

38
00:02:07.291 --> 00:02:10.200
<v Speaker 1>perfectly okay to wear pants when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>riding the subway.</v>

39
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.020
<v Speaker 1>But in the UK you'd better where some </v>
<v Speaker 1>trousers too,</v>

40
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.883
<v Speaker 1>because pants means underpants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And specifically women's underpants are </v>

41
00:02:18.091 --> 00:02:20.940
<v Speaker 1>sometimes referred to as knickers in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>UK.</v>

42
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.410
<v Speaker 1>So when someone overreacts to something </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the u s you might say,</v>

43
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.040
<v Speaker 1>don't get your panties in a bunch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in the UK you would say,</v>

44
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.780
<v Speaker 1>don't get your knickers in a twist.</v>

45
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.750
<v Speaker 2>Paul,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how dare you be so crude?</v>

46
00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.450
<v Speaker 2>I can't show this video to my six year </v>
<v Speaker 2>old students.</v>

47
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.010
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't even worry about that.</v>

48
00:02:37.011 --> 00:02:39.110
<v Speaker 1>They'll just watch it on their phones </v>
<v Speaker 1>during recess.</v>

49
00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.780
<v Speaker 1>Going back to the word pants for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment,</v>

50
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.660
<v Speaker 1>it can also be used in British English </v>
<v Speaker 1>as an adjective,</v>

51
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.350
<v Speaker 1>meaning something is crappy or it sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

52
00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.110
<v Speaker 1>that's how album his pants in American </v>
<v Speaker 1>English,</v>

53
00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.300
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that album sucks.</v>

54
00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.853
<v Speaker 1>Excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for the U S I'll try to focus on </v>

55
00:02:57.111 --> 00:02:57.944
<v Speaker 1>general American English and for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll try to focus on received </v>

56
00:03:01.121 --> 00:03:01.954
<v Speaker 1>pronunciation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are the accents you're likely to </v>

57
00:03:03.641 --> 00:03:08.641
<v Speaker 1>hear on CNN and the BBC respectively are</v>
<v Speaker 1>sounds American English is roddick,</v>

58
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:10.713
<v Speaker 1>meaning that our sounds are always </v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly pronounced British English is </v>

59
00:03:13.901 --> 00:03:18.220
<v Speaker 1>non Roddick meaning that the r sound is </v>
<v Speaker 1>not pronounced unless it's followed by a</v>

60
00:03:18.221 --> 00:03:20.200
<v Speaker 1>vowel sound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen to the difference.</v>

61
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.410
<v Speaker 1>My father's in the car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my father's in the car.</v>

62
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.590
<v Speaker 1>Let's focus on two words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Father,</v>

63
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.150
<v Speaker 1>father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>car,</v>

64
00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:29.163
<v Speaker 1>car.</v>

65
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.620
<v Speaker 1>Notice that the final r sound is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>pronounced in British English.</v>

66
00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.390
<v Speaker 1>Father ends in a simple Schwab vowel </v>
<v Speaker 1>like father and in car.</v>

67
00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.110
<v Speaker 1>The vowel sound is linkedin in place of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the r sound car.</v>

68
00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:42.783
<v Speaker 1>Now the thing about British non Roddick </v>
<v Speaker 1>accents that I find pretty wild is </v>

69
00:03:45.701 --> 00:03:46.534
<v Speaker 1>something called the intrusive are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means that people sometimes add an </v>

70
00:03:49.811 --> 00:03:52.360
<v Speaker 1>r sound to a word that doesn't actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>have one.</v>

71
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.790
<v Speaker 1>If it's followed by a vowel in the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>word.</v>

72
00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.013
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the sentence I saw a film in British </v>

73
00:03:58.181 --> 00:04:00.190
<v Speaker 1>English.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sometimes sounds like this.</v>

74
00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:01.143
<v Speaker 1>I saw a film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can hear that there's an r sound </v>

75
00:04:03.191 --> 00:04:04.024
<v Speaker 1>connecting saw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I once had a British on the job </v>

76
00:04:07.121 --> 00:04:09.100
<v Speaker 1>trainer and I remember she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hello,</v>

77
00:04:09.101 --> 00:04:11.590
<v Speaker 1>my name is Paula and I will be your </v>
<v Speaker 1>trainer today.</v>

78
00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.450
<v Speaker 1>I remember thinking polar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

79
00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.120
<v Speaker 1>You can't say your own name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't just her.</v>

80
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.990
<v Speaker 1>That was the intrusive are t sounds in </v>
<v Speaker 1>British English.</v>

81
00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.853
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I must emphasize that I'm talking about </v>

82
00:04:22.511 --> 00:04:25.330
<v Speaker 1>the accent referred to as received.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pronunciation.</v>

83
00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.600
<v Speaker 1>T sounds are pronounced as hard teas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in other words,</v>

84
00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:29.493
<v Speaker 1>voiceless to sounds in the u s they </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes sound like an alveolar tap </v>

85
00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:35.463
<v Speaker 1>instead of to an Alveolar stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This normally occurs in an unstressed </v>

86
00:04:39.311 --> 00:04:43.870
<v Speaker 1>syllable between two vowel sounds or </v>
<v Speaker 1>between a vowel and a roddick sound like</v>

87
00:04:43.871 --> 00:04:44.704
<v Speaker 1>an Rsl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in the u s people say butter in the </v>

88
00:04:48.131 --> 00:04:52.060
<v Speaker 1>UK,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say butter in the u s stop fighting</v>

89
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.190
<v Speaker 1>in the UK.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stop fighting.</v>

90
00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:55.503
<v Speaker 1>You may have also noticed that the ow </v>
<v Speaker 1>sound in the word stop was a little </v>

91
00:04:58.091 --> 00:04:59.830
<v Speaker 1>different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which brings me to,</v>

92
00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:01.780
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sounds in the word stop.</v>

93
00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.660
<v Speaker 1>The American oh sound is an unrounded </v>
<v Speaker 1>vowel.</v>

94
00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:08.140
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while the British oh sound is rounded or</v>

95
00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:09.820
<v Speaker 1>another example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hot,</v>

96
00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:11.083
<v Speaker 1>hot.</v>

97
00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.840
<v Speaker 1>There's also the o Diphthong in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>word?</v>

98
00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.550
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the UK,</v>

99
00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:18.790
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the UK the sound is a Schwab followed</v>

100
00:05:18.791 --> 00:05:23.791
<v Speaker 1>by an as input show show a sounds in </v>
<v Speaker 1>other words,</v>

101
00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.620
<v Speaker 1>sounds represented by the letter a are </v>
<v Speaker 1>in UK.</v>

102
00:05:29.621 --> 00:05:33.550
<v Speaker 1>English normally becomes an ass out in </v>
<v Speaker 1>American English for example,</v>

103
00:05:33.551 --> 00:05:38.551
<v Speaker 1>in the UK Hoff and in the u s half words</v>
<v Speaker 1>without in British English remain pretty</v>

104
00:05:40.721 --> 00:05:45.721
<v Speaker 1>similar in American English in the UK </v>
<v Speaker 1>cat end to the u s cat.</v>

105
00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:51.340
<v Speaker 1>An exception is a small set of words in </v>
<v Speaker 1>which the AE is followed by a double are</v>

106
00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:56.080
<v Speaker 1>in which case the vowel is pronounced as</v>
<v Speaker 1>air in the u s in the UK,</v>

107
00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:57.063
<v Speaker 1>Mary in the U s Mary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because of the difference in the u s </v>

108
00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.933
<v Speaker 1>Mary and Mary sound the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carrie and Carrie sound the same </v>

109
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:07.663
<v Speaker 1>spelling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>American and British spellings are </v>

110
00:06:09.441 --> 00:06:12.200
<v Speaker 1>largely the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are a few notable differences.</v>

111
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:14.810
<v Speaker 1>This is in large part because Noah </v>
<v Speaker 1>Webster,</v>

112
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.000
<v Speaker 1>whom the webster dictionary is named </v>
<v Speaker 1>after,</v>

113
00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:17.863
<v Speaker 1>made an effort to reform English </v>
<v Speaker 1>spelling in the 17 hundreds in order to </v>

114
00:06:20.901 --> 00:06:22.790
<v Speaker 1>make the word spelled the way they </v>
<v Speaker 1>sounded.</v>

115
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.833
<v Speaker 1>This resulted in some spelling changes </v>
<v Speaker 1>in American English most but not all </v>

116
00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:32.210
<v Speaker 1>words that ended Ari in the UK and in Er</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the u s for example,</v>

117
00:06:32.211 --> 00:06:35.000
<v Speaker 1>center theater,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meter somber.</v>

118
00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:36.883
<v Speaker 1>Some words that end in nce in the UK are</v>
<v Speaker 1>spelled with an se in the u s license </v>

119
00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:47.170
<v Speaker 1>defense offense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some words with ou in the UK are spelled</v>

120
00:06:47.421 --> 00:06:50.540
<v Speaker 1>with oh in the u s color,</v>
<v Speaker 1>favor,</v>

121
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:52.160
<v Speaker 1>honor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>labor,</v>

122
00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:53.203
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ending I s e became izze in the u s </v>

123
00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:00.020
<v Speaker 1>organize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apologize.</v>

124
00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:04.760
<v Speaker 1>A similar change also occurs in other </v>
<v Speaker 1>contexts where the s is voiced.</v>

125
00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:08.810
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes a sound analyze cozy.</v>

126
00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:13.400
<v Speaker 1>There are verbs ending with El that take</v>
<v Speaker 1>a double l in British English.</v>

127
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:15.980
<v Speaker 1>When a suffix is added in American </v>
<v Speaker 1>English,</v>

128
00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:19.160
<v Speaker 1>there's no double l traveled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>canceled,</v>

129
00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:20.053
<v Speaker 1>marvelous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're wondering how the last one </v>

130
00:07:21.801 --> 00:07:22.634
<v Speaker 1>fits in with the others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember that marvel is a verb and then </v>

131
00:07:25.341 --> 00:07:28.880
<v Speaker 1>an adjectival suffix is added to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Grammar.</v>

132
00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:30.013
<v Speaker 1>There were only very minor grammatical </v>
<v Speaker 1>differences between British English and </v>

133
00:07:32.811 --> 00:07:33.644
<v Speaker 1>American English auxiliary verbs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>British people use Shell for the future </v>

134
00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:40.940
<v Speaker 1>much more than Americans as well as to </v>
<v Speaker 1>ask for advice or an opinion.</v>

135
00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:45.710
<v Speaker 1>Some difference in preposition use in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the u s people say on the weekend,</v>

136
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:46.783
<v Speaker 1>but in the UK they say after the weekend</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the u s people say different </v>

137
00:07:50.421 --> 00:07:53.900
<v Speaker 1>from or different them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the UK they say different from or</v>

138
00:07:53.901 --> 00:07:54.734
<v Speaker 1>difference too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are some different past tense </v>

139
00:07:58.251 --> 00:07:59.540
<v Speaker 1>forms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

140
00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:00.403
<v Speaker 1>in American English,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the past tense of the word learn is </v>

141
00:08:02.391 --> 00:08:03.224
<v Speaker 1>learned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While in British English it's more </v>

142
00:08:04.551 --> 00:08:05.840
<v Speaker 1>common to say learnt.</v>

143
00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.360
<v Speaker 1>Actually both forms are used in either </v>
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>

144
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:10.940
<v Speaker 1>but there is more of a tendency towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>one form.</v>

145
00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:12.013
<v Speaker 1>This is true for other words like </v>
<v Speaker 1>dreamed versus drempt burned versus </v>

146
00:08:15.321 --> 00:08:17.990
<v Speaker 1>burnt leaned versus linked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

147
00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:23.000
<v Speaker 1>Another example in the u s the past </v>
<v Speaker 1>tense of dive is usually dove.</v>

148
00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:24.800
<v Speaker 1>In the UK,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's dived.</v>

149
00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:29.210
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the American form developed by </v>
<v Speaker 1>analogy with drive and drove.</v>

150
00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:30.253
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>differences like these are not </v>

151
00:08:31.281 --> 00:08:33.420
<v Speaker 1>consistent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you'll notice some different paths,</v>

152
00:08:33.421 --> 00:08:34.254
<v Speaker 1>tense forms here in their past </v>
<v Speaker 1>participles sometimes past participles </v>

153
00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:39.133
<v Speaker 1>half a different form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The most well known example is for the </v>

154
00:08:41.151 --> 00:08:41.984
<v Speaker 1>verb get in the u s there's get got </v>
<v Speaker 1>gotten but in the UK it's get got got </v>

155
00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:51.680
<v Speaker 1>both forms got and gotten have existed </v>
<v Speaker 1>since the middle English period,</v>

156
00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.380
<v Speaker 1>but Godson has fallen out of use in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>UK.</v>

157
00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:55.853
<v Speaker 1>Got It.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can Be used in American English in the </v>

158
00:08:57.871 --> 00:09:02.871
<v Speaker 1>form have got but with the meaning of </v>
<v Speaker 1>have not have received or have become.</v>

159
00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:06.210
<v Speaker 1>I haven't gotten the eviction notice </v>
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>

160
00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:09.510
<v Speaker 1>I haven't got the eviction notice yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

161
00:09:09.511 --> 00:09:14.511
<v Speaker 1>let's check a couple more sentences and </v>
<v Speaker 1>see what we encounter in the u s I think</v>

162
00:09:14.581 --> 00:09:18.630
<v Speaker 1>we need a lawyer in the UK.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I reckon we needed a solicitor.</v>

163
00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:21.420
<v Speaker 1>You'll notice that a couple of words </v>
<v Speaker 1>here are different.</v>

164
00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.640
<v Speaker 1>British people often use the word </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible],</v>

165
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:26.970
<v Speaker 1>which means think or suppose Americans </v>
<v Speaker 1>know this word,</v>

166
00:09:26.971 --> 00:09:27.804
<v Speaker 1>but rarely use it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and while Americans would typically </v>

167
00:09:29.731 --> 00:09:33.630
<v Speaker 1>refer to a professional legal consultant</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a lawyer in the UK,</v>

168
00:09:33.631 --> 00:09:34.464
<v Speaker 1>they often say solicitor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a type of lawyer that does </v>

169
00:09:36.691 --> 00:09:39.480
<v Speaker 1>consultation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The type of lawyer who represents you in</v>

170
00:09:39.481 --> 00:09:40.314
<v Speaker 1>court in the UK is usually a barrister.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While in the U s they're usually </v>

171
00:09:43.501 --> 00:09:44.334
<v Speaker 1>referred to as attorneys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another sentence in the U s I'm going </v>

172
00:09:48.751 --> 00:09:53.040
<v Speaker 1>for a beer with my friends in the UK.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going for a pint with my mates.</v>

173
00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:57.510
<v Speaker 1>Notice that British people often say </v>
<v Speaker 1>pint where Americans would say beer.</v>

174
00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.240
<v Speaker 1>Brits also say beer as a countable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now unlike this,</v>

175
00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:04.110
<v Speaker 1>but pint is frequently used and notice </v>
<v Speaker 1>that Britt's often say mate,</v>

176
00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:05.910
<v Speaker 1>where Americans would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>friend,</v>

177
00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:07.693
<v Speaker 1>the differences between British English </v>
<v Speaker 1>and American English might seem </v>

178
00:10:10.251 --> 00:10:11.084
<v Speaker 1>surprising or a music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but remember in this video I'm zooming </v>

179
00:10:13.701 --> 00:10:15.740
<v Speaker 1>in on the differences and focusing on </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

180
00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:17.660
<v Speaker 1>For the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're actually the same.</v>

181
00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:21.890
<v Speaker 1>There are some minor differences in </v>
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary and pronunciation and grammar</v>

182
00:10:21.891 --> 00:10:24.620
<v Speaker 1>and spelling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but any native speaker with a little bit</v>

183
00:10:24.621 --> 00:10:25.454
<v Speaker 1>of exposure to the other look quickly </v>
<v Speaker 1>adapt to these differences and be able </v>

184
00:10:28.161 --> 00:10:30.710
<v Speaker 1>to understand the other variety without </v>
<v Speaker 1>any problem.</v>

185
00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:31.843
<v Speaker 1>The differences are sometimes greater if</v>
<v Speaker 1>we focus on regional dialects and socio </v>

186
00:10:35.151 --> 00:10:37.430
<v Speaker 1>elects of British English and American </v>
<v Speaker 1>English.</v>

187
00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:38.473
<v Speaker 1>While most Americans probably have no </v>
<v Speaker 1>trouble understanding received </v>

188
00:10:41.031 --> 00:10:43.670
<v Speaker 1>pronunciation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they may have some trouble understanding</v>

189
00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:48.290
<v Speaker 1>cockney English or the Jordy accent of </v>
<v Speaker 1>northeastern England or other varieties.</v>

190
00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:51.050
<v Speaker 1>But as far as standard non regional </v>
<v Speaker 1>speech goes,</v>

191
00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:53.000
<v Speaker 1>I'd say that the differences are </v>
<v Speaker 1>minimal.</v>

192
00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:53.983
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>learners of English who focus on one of </v>

193
00:10:55.611 --> 00:10:56.444
<v Speaker 1>the two varieties will likely have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit of trouble understanding the </v>

194
00:10:58.941 --> 00:11:01.520
<v Speaker 1>other until they gained significant </v>
<v Speaker 1>exposure to it.</v>

195
00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:02.683
<v Speaker 1>The question of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what other differences between American </v>

196
00:11:04.851 --> 00:11:07.250
<v Speaker 1>and British English are you aware of in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this video?</v>

197
00:11:07.251 --> 00:11:10.100
<v Speaker 1>I was only able to give a limited number</v>
<v Speaker 1>of examples,</v>

198
00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:12.920
<v Speaker 1>so add yours in the comments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be sure to follow Lang,</v>

200
00:11:14.541 --> 00:11:16.220

<v Speaker 1>And once again,</v>
