00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:01.273
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2
00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:02.760
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3
00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:05.250
<v Speaker 1>Paul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4
00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.440
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] Burke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cornell,</v>

5
00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

6
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:11.663
<v Speaker 1>I've been studying Indonesian for six </v>
<v Speaker 1>months and 17 days and I still can't </v>

7
00:00:15.241 --> 00:00:16.500
<v Speaker 1>introduce myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going</v>

8
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.353
<v Speaker 2>and Andrea.</v>

9
00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:24.760
<v Speaker 1>Hi Guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is Paul.</v>

10
00:00:24.761 --> 00:00:25.594
<v Speaker 1>Today I want to talk to you about one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most important elements of learning </v>

11
00:00:29.531 --> 00:00:32.800
<v Speaker 1>a language of studying a language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that is consistency.</v>

12
00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.250
<v Speaker 1>This is one of my mottos is consistency </v>
<v Speaker 1>is king.</v>

13
00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.820
<v Speaker 1>If you read my blog or something you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever talked to me about languages,</v>

14
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.190
<v Speaker 1>you probably heard me say that slogan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that model,</v>

15
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.430
<v Speaker 1>the consistency is king.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

16
00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:46.443
<v Speaker 1>the people who really get good at </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages are the people who study </v>

17
00:00:50.411 --> 00:00:51.244
<v Speaker 1>consistently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They study every day come hell or high </v>

18
00:00:53.291 --> 00:00:54.124
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't find excuses to skip the </v>

19
00:00:56.271 --> 00:00:57.104
<v Speaker 1>studying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people who don't really learn as </v>

20
00:00:59.531 --> 00:01:00.364
<v Speaker 1>much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people who,</v>

21
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.493
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't get that good that people would </v>

22
00:01:02.701 --> 00:01:04.220
<v Speaker 1>learn just a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

23
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.220
<v Speaker 1>those are the people who just study </v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever,</v>

24
00:01:06.221 --> 00:01:07.030
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it,</v>

25
00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.690
<v Speaker 1>the people who don't study consistently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just study based on a whim.</v>

26
00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.710
<v Speaker 1>So I like to think about consistency in </v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple of ways.</v>

27
00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.720
<v Speaker 1>The first way is like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

28
00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.850
<v Speaker 1>your language ability is like a bucket </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a small hole in the bottom,</v>

29
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:23.373
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

30
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:24.223
<v Speaker 1>so the water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the liquid inside is your language </v>

31
00:01:25.841 --> 00:01:26.674
<v Speaker 1>ability and if you stopped studying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there's a slow leak and your </v>

32
00:01:30.941 --> 00:01:34.210
<v Speaker 1>ability will slowly diminish if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't talk about the bucket.</v>

33
00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.750
<v Speaker 1>But if you top up the bucket every day </v>
<v Speaker 1>by studying,</v>

34
00:01:37.751 --> 00:01:40.130
<v Speaker 1>then you can maintain the level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

35
00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.550
<v Speaker 1>consistently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can maintain a certain level or even</v>

36
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.260
<v Speaker 1>raise the level of the liquid inside the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bucket.</v>

37
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.960
<v Speaker 1>But it's when you stop studying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're not consistent,</v>

38
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.153
<v Speaker 1>then gradually day by day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each day a little bit of the liquid </v>

39
00:01:52.341 --> 00:01:54.680
<v Speaker 1>leaks out the bottom and the level </v>
<v Speaker 1>diminishes.</v>

40
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.960
<v Speaker 1>So that's like your language ability </v>
<v Speaker 1>going down.</v>

41
00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:58.063
<v Speaker 1>So if you've ever studied a language for</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple months and then you took a few </v>

42
00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:02.743
<v Speaker 1>weeks off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like maybe you just lost motivation or </v>

43
00:02:04.221 --> 00:02:05.870
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you came back to it.</v>

44
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:06.703
<v Speaker 1>You probably noticed if you probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>felt that you had lost the majority of </v>

45
00:02:10.701 --> 00:02:12.230
<v Speaker 1>what you had learned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

46
00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:13.503
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's because you had that little </v>

47
00:02:14.241 --> 00:02:18.320
<v Speaker 1>bit of liquid in the bucket.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it gradually mostly leaked out.</v>

48
00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.390
<v Speaker 1>There was probably some residue in </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

49
00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:21.283
<v Speaker 1>a few drops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you probably lost a lot of the meat </v>

50
00:02:23.451 --> 00:02:24.980
<v Speaker 1>of what you had learned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

51
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.150
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one,</v>

52
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one example.</v>

53
00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:28.783
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

54
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:29.633
<v Speaker 1>if you've ever been a couple of years </v>
<v Speaker 1>into studying a language like a year or </v>

55
00:02:32.211 --> 00:02:34.280
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you took a few weeks off,</v>

56
00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.460
<v Speaker 1>you probably noticed that your level had</v>
<v Speaker 1>diminished a bit.</v>

57
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.353
<v Speaker 1>Probably it had gone down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you probably didn't feel like you </v>

58
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:42.523
<v Speaker 1>lost most of what you've learned because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's that gradual diminishment is that </v>

59
00:02:45.921 --> 00:02:48.290
<v Speaker 1>gradual lowering of the level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a slow leak.</v>

60
00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.030
<v Speaker 1>So the more of a beginner you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

61
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.320
<v Speaker 1>the more of your ability you will lose </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're not consistent.</v>

62
00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:55.643
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the way to always maintain your </v>

63
00:02:56.691 --> 00:02:57.524
<v Speaker 1>level and to keep increasing it is to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>consistent and top up the bucket every </v>

64
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.853
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's one way I like to think about </v>

65
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:05.523
<v Speaker 1>your consistency of and studying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other way I like to think about it </v>

66
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.230
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

67
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.040
<v Speaker 1>in terms of investing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you invest money over time,</v>

68
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you do it consistently,</v>

69
00:03:17.141 --> 00:03:19.690
<v Speaker 1>you can gain compound interest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

70
00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.750
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that means that you make interest on the</v>

71
00:03:22.751 --> 00:03:23.584
<v Speaker 1>money that you invest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you make interest on the </v>

72
00:03:25.151 --> 00:03:27.330
<v Speaker 1>interest as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

73
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.510
<v Speaker 1>this is similar to a phenomenon that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've noticed when studying consistently.</v>

74
00:03:31.511 --> 00:03:35.710
<v Speaker 1>When you study every day consistently </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you don't take days off,</v>

75
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.933
<v Speaker 1>you're learning kind of takes on a life </v>
<v Speaker 1>of its own and you end up learning more </v>

76
00:03:40.211 --> 00:03:42.910
<v Speaker 1>than you would expect from the amount </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're studying.</v>

77
00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.430
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

78
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.620
<v Speaker 1>that's partly because just your brain is</v>
<v Speaker 1>learning,</v>

79
00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:48.723
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the off time when you're not </v>

80
00:03:49.691 --> 00:03:50.524
<v Speaker 1>studying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of processing things in the </v>

81
00:03:51.671 --> 00:03:52.660
<v Speaker 1>background all day.</v>

82
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.020
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but basically if you are consistent,</v>

83
00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.883
<v Speaker 1>then you can get your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your learning to sort of critical mass </v>

84
00:04:00.131 --> 00:04:00.964
<v Speaker 1>where it starts to take on a life of its</v>
<v Speaker 1>own and you learn more than you would </v>

85
00:04:03.911 --> 00:04:06.610
<v Speaker 1>have if you had studied that same number</v>
<v Speaker 1>of days.</v>

86
00:04:06.611 --> 00:04:10.000
<v Speaker 1>But with breaks in between.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's really important to,</v>

87
00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:11.223
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to always keep investing on a daily </v>

88
00:04:13.391 --> 00:04:15.480
<v Speaker 1>basis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>investing regularly so they could,</v>

89
00:04:15.481 --> 00:04:18.310
<v Speaker 1>you can get that compounding effect in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your learning.</v>

90
00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:19.383
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's another way I like to think </v>

91
00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:20.930
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's the,</v>

92
00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.340
<v Speaker 1>the bucket with a hole in the bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then there's compounding interest.</v>

93
00:04:24.341 --> 00:04:25.174
<v Speaker 1>There's those two ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the most important point is study </v>

94
00:04:28.481 --> 00:04:29.770
<v Speaker 1>every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be Consistent.</v>

95
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.040
<v Speaker 1>Also put in a certain amount of time </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyday.</v>

96
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.970
<v Speaker 1>Try to commit as much time to it as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can.</v>

97
00:04:33.971 --> 00:04:37.780
<v Speaker 1>But more important than that is to do it</v>
<v Speaker 1>consistently every day.</v>

98
00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.740
<v Speaker 1>How do you be consistent?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the question that remains.</v>

99
00:04:41.741 --> 00:04:46.600
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people intend to be consistent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they end up taking a lot of time,</v>

100
00:04:46.601 --> 00:04:47.434
<v Speaker 1>often being inconsistent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those people usually are taking </v>

101
00:04:52.511 --> 00:04:55.210
<v Speaker 1>action based on how they feel at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>

102
00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.310
<v Speaker 1>They wake up in the morning and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

103
00:04:57.311 --> 00:04:58.450
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm tired today.</v>

104
00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.250
<v Speaker 1>A screw it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to study today.</v>

105
00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:01.503
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're basing their actions on the </v>

106
00:05:03.461 --> 00:05:04.294
<v Speaker 1>feeling of that moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is something you can't really </v>

107
00:05:06.221 --> 00:05:06.911
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

108
00:05:06.911 --> 00:05:11.170
<v Speaker 1>the way you feel depends on all sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 1>different factors out of your control.</v>

109
00:05:11.171 --> 00:05:14.260
<v Speaker 1>It depends on maybe what you ate </v>
<v Speaker 1>yesterday.</v>

110
00:05:14.261 --> 00:05:17.440
<v Speaker 1>It depends on the weather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It depends on how well you slept,</v>

111
00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:19.510
<v Speaker 1>depends on stress at work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these things.</v>

112
00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:20.563
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can't really control it that </v>

113
00:05:21.881 --> 00:05:25.720
<v Speaker 1>easily unless you're always monitoring </v>
<v Speaker 1>all those things really closely.</v>

114
00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.033
<v Speaker 1>So the way to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way to take action should be based </v>

115
00:05:29.561 --> 00:05:30.394
<v Speaker 1>on your vision for your outcome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you want to get out of learning </v>

116
00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:35.584
<v Speaker 1>that language.</v>

117
00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.850
<v Speaker 1>And also based on just the commitment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a commitment to achieving that outcome,</v>

118
00:05:39.851 --> 00:05:40.684
<v Speaker 1>achieving that vision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say you want to be a French </v>

119
00:05:43.091 --> 00:05:44.770
<v Speaker 1>English translator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's your dream.</v>

120
00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:47.740
<v Speaker 1>So you have to have that vision in mind </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the future,</v>

121
00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.180
<v Speaker 1>that goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what will that look like?</v>

122
00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:53.140
<v Speaker 1>And then a commitment to work hard every</v>
<v Speaker 1>day to achieve then,</v>

123
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.180
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then in that case,</v>

124
00:05:55.181 --> 00:05:56.014
<v Speaker 1>if you have that vision and commitment </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you up in the morning and you're </v>

125
00:05:58.101 --> 00:06:02.390
<v Speaker 1>tired or you're hung over or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you will just tell yourself,</v>

126
00:06:02.391 --> 00:06:03.890
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel like it today,</v>

127
00:06:03.891 --> 00:06:06.050
<v Speaker 1>but I have that vision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the commitment.</v>

128
00:06:06.051 --> 00:06:09.050
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to do it anyway because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not based on the feeling.</v>

129
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.333
<v Speaker 1>So that's how you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how you can be consistent is by </v>

130
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:14.030
<v Speaker 1>doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

131
00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:18.230
<v Speaker 1>Don't let it be based on a feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A feeling is changing by the moment.</v>

132
00:06:18.231 --> 00:06:22.550
<v Speaker 1>It's out of your control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A base it on your vision and commitment.</v>

133
00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:24.020
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hope that's helpful.</v>

134
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:26.410
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much for listening and </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk to you,</v>

135
00:06:26.411 --> 00:06:27.244
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

136
00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:33.913
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
