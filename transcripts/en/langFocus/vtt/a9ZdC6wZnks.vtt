<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Lange focus channel.</v>

2
00:00:02.561 --> 00:00:03.394
<v Speaker 1>This is just a quick mini video to </v>
<v Speaker 1>answer a frequently asked question that </v>

3
00:00:06.191 --> 00:00:09.370
<v Speaker 1>I get on my channel and that is what is </v>
<v Speaker 1>a Lingua Franca.</v>

4
00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.190
<v Speaker 1>Lingua Franca is a phrase that I use a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot on the channel.</v>

5
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:13.463
<v Speaker 1>A Lingua Franca is a language that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>used for communication between people </v>

6
00:00:16.721 --> 00:00:20.460
<v Speaker 1>who speak different native languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here are a couple of examples,</v>

7
00:00:20.461 --> 00:00:23.260
<v Speaker 1>situations of when a Lingua Franca is </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessary.</v>

8
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.273
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are many languages spoken in a </v>

9
00:00:25.661 --> 00:00:29.410
<v Speaker 1>particular area or amongst different </v>
<v Speaker 1>ethnic groups and they need the language</v>

10
00:00:29.411 --> 00:00:31.840
<v Speaker 1>to communicate with one another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another example,</v>

11
00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:35.470
<v Speaker 1>there is trade between two different </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries that have no common language.</v>

12
00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:37.713
<v Speaker 1>Example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three at a professional conference for </v>

13
00:00:39.221 --> 00:00:40.054
<v Speaker 1>experts from different countries who </v>
<v Speaker 1>have different native languages on a </v>

14
00:00:42.611 --> 00:00:43.444
<v Speaker 1>global scale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The current largest Lingua Franca is </v>

15
00:00:45.461 --> 00:00:46.294
<v Speaker 1>English,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are other various Lingua </v>

16
00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.380
<v Speaker 1>Franca is on a regional level and on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>national level.</v>

17
00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.950
<v Speaker 1>An example of a regional Lingua Franca </v>
<v Speaker 1>is the French language.</v>

18
00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:54.813
<v Speaker 1>In Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are a lot of different languages </v>

19
00:00:56.321 --> 00:00:57.154
<v Speaker 1>spoken in Africa and in a large portion </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the continent they use French as </v>

20
00:01:00.131 --> 00:01:02.830
<v Speaker 1>their language of communication as their</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lingua Franca.</v>

21
00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:04.323
<v Speaker 1>An example of a national Lingua Franca </v>
<v Speaker 1>is in Pakistan where there are various </v>

22
00:01:07.991 --> 00:01:08.824
<v Speaker 1>different languages spoken,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but or Redo the national language is </v>

23
00:01:11.141 --> 00:01:13.780
<v Speaker 1>used as the Lingua Franca between those </v>
<v Speaker 1>different groups.</v>

24
00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.823
<v Speaker 1>And other similar situation is in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Philippines where they have to Lingua </v>

25
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.110
<v Speaker 1>Franca us kind of what they mixed the </v>
<v Speaker 1>two Lingua Franca.</v>

26
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.520
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they have to gallog and </v>
<v Speaker 1>English and those are used as the Lingua</v>

27
00:01:24.521 --> 00:01:27.490
<v Speaker 1>Franca between people from different </v>
<v Speaker 1>regions of the country.</v>

28
00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.013
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes there are both National Lingua</v>
<v Speaker 1>Franca is and more local Lingua Franca </v>

29
00:01:32.591 --> 00:01:33.424
<v Speaker 1>is within a country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if we take the example of </v>

30
00:01:35.021 --> 00:01:35.854
<v Speaker 1>Philippines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a region where Ilocano is the </v>

31
00:01:38.231 --> 00:01:39.064
<v Speaker 1>main language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So someone from the Ilocanos speaking </v>

32
00:01:41.081 --> 00:01:43.270
<v Speaker 1>region meet someone from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

33
00:01:43.271 --> 00:01:47.170
<v Speaker 1>the BCO speaking region.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll probably use the national Lingua</v>

34
00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:48.003
<v Speaker 1>Franca,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is tagalog or English or use both </v>

35
00:01:49.811 --> 00:01:50.530
<v Speaker 1>of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

36
00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:51.363
<v Speaker 1>but if that same person meets someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the Ilocanos speaking region who </v>

37
00:01:54.581 --> 00:01:57.370
<v Speaker 1>speaks a different language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a minority language,</v>

38
00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:58.383
<v Speaker 1>then they'll probably use that local </v>
<v Speaker 1>language Ilocano as the Lingua Franca </v>

39
00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.170
<v Speaker 1>because just in that one region there </v>
<v Speaker 1>are various languages spoken.</v>

40
00:02:05.171 --> 00:02:08.650
<v Speaker 1>So the Lingua Franca you use depends on </v>
<v Speaker 1>who you're speaking to.</v>

41
00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.710
<v Speaker 1>So you're sort of leveling up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you speak to someone in your region,</v>

42
00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.100
<v Speaker 1>you can't understand them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Use that regional Lingua Franca.</v>

43
00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.060
<v Speaker 1>If you speak to someone from a different</v>
<v Speaker 1>region used the national Lingua Franca.</v>

44
00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.313
<v Speaker 1>So it sounds all kind of complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but basically it means speak the </v>

45
00:02:22.781 --> 00:02:25.360
<v Speaker 1>language that helps you communicate with</v>
<v Speaker 1>that person the best.</v>

46
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

47
00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:29.373
<v Speaker 1>The term Lingua Franca itself comes from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the name of a language that was spoken </v>

48
00:02:32.591 --> 00:02:35.650
<v Speaker 1>in this way in the Mediterranean region </v>
<v Speaker 1>for hundreds of years.</v>

49
00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:36.723
<v Speaker 1>It was kind of a creole romance language</v>
<v Speaker 1>that had a lot of vocabulary from </v>

50
00:02:39.881 --> 00:02:42.280
<v Speaker 1>different Mediterranean languages mixed </v>
<v Speaker 1>into it.</v>

51
00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.820
<v Speaker 1>One English source from 1632 referred to</v>
<v Speaker 1>this language as bastard Spanish.</v>

52
00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:51.213
<v Speaker 1>So to wrap up and clarify,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Lingua Franca is a language that is </v>

53
00:02:54.011 --> 00:02:57.940
<v Speaker 1>used for communication between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>speakers of different native languages.</v>

54
00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.490
<v Speaker 1>I hope that clarifies things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for watching.</v>

55
00:03:00.491 --> 00:03:01.720
<v Speaker 1>Have a nice day.</v>
