<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Internet and my name is </v>

2
00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.060
<v Speaker 1>today we're going to look at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>differences between Chinese and Chinese.</v>

3
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.063
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I mean is we'll be looking at two </v>

4
00:00:12.661 --> 00:00:16.230
<v Speaker 1>of the many Chinese languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mandarin and Cantonese.</v>

5
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.670
<v Speaker 1>As I mentioned in my video on Chinese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese is not a single language,</v>

6
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.533
<v Speaker 1>but rather a number of dialect groups </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are united by a common writing </v>

7
00:00:24.901 --> 00:00:25.734
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The spoken languages are different and </v>

8
00:00:27.661 --> 00:00:28.494
<v Speaker 1>generally mutually unintelligible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is definitely the case with </v>

9
00:00:31.141 --> 00:00:31.974
<v Speaker 1>Mandarin and Cantonese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are both Semitic languages or </v>

10
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.500
<v Speaker 1>Chinese languages spoken in China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mandarin is spoken by 960 million native</v>

11
00:00:40.021 --> 00:00:42.120
<v Speaker 1>speakers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mainly in the north of China,</v>

12
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.133
<v Speaker 1>but as now used all over mainland China </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Taiwan as the official language of </v>

13
00:00:46.381 --> 00:00:48.150
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>media and education,</v>

14
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.510
<v Speaker 1>and it's one of the four official </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages of Singapore as well.</v>

15
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:57.380
<v Speaker 1>Cantonese on the other hand is spoken by</v>
<v Speaker 1>50 to 60 million native speakers in Hong</v>

16
00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.253
<v Speaker 1>Kong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Macau go on zillow and some adjacent </v>

17
00:00:59.791 --> 00:01:03.420
<v Speaker 1>areas as well as in Chinese diaspora </v>
<v Speaker 1>communities around the world.</v>

18
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.600
<v Speaker 1>It's part of the wider UAA branch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese.</v>

19
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.520
<v Speaker 1>Before we get into the main room.</v>
