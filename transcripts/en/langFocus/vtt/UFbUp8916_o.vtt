00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:09.653
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and </v>

2
00:00:11.171 --> 00:00:12.004
<v Speaker 1>my name is Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today I'm going to talk about the </v>

3
00:00:13.771 --> 00:00:16.590
<v Speaker 1>Kurdish language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas Curtis Spoken,</v>

4
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.090
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an interesting question.</v>

5
00:00:18.091 --> 00:00:21.630
<v Speaker 1>Kurdish is the language of the Kurdish </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and ethnic group who did not have</v>

6
00:00:21.631 --> 00:00:22.464
<v Speaker 1>their own independent country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They mostly live in the Kurdistan </v>

7
00:00:24.721 --> 00:00:25.554
<v Speaker 1>region,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which consists of much of southeast </v>

8
00:00:26.911 --> 00:00:27.744
<v Speaker 1>Turkey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>northeastern Syria and northern Iraq in </v>

9
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.850
<v Speaker 1>northwestern Iran,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well as some other isolated areas and</v>

10
00:00:32.851 --> 00:00:36.750
<v Speaker 1>the former Soviet Union Kurdish as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>majority language spoken in those areas,</v>

11
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.410
<v Speaker 1>there are approximately 30 million </v>
<v Speaker 1>native speakers of Kurdish.</v>

12
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.380
<v Speaker 1>That includes around 14.5</v>
<v Speaker 1>million in Turkey,</v>

13
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.450
<v Speaker 1>5.6</v>
<v Speaker 1>million in Iraq,</v>

14
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.480
<v Speaker 1>6 million in Iran and around 2 million </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Syria.</v>

15
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.710
<v Speaker 1>It also includes a Kurdish diaspora </v>
<v Speaker 1>living outside of the Kurdistan region,</v>

16
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.110
<v Speaker 1>most notably in Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Persian.</v>

17
00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:55.973
<v Speaker 1>Kurdish is a member of the indoor </v>
<v Speaker 1>running and branch of the Indo European </v>

18
00:00:58.351 --> 00:00:59.184
<v Speaker 1>language family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're as Persian belongs to the </v>

19
00:01:00.661 --> 00:01:01.890
<v Speaker 1>southwestern sub branch.</v>

20
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.140
<v Speaker 1>Kurdish belongs to the northwestern </v>
<v Speaker 1>sub-branch.</v>

21
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.120
<v Speaker 1>Persian and Kurdish share many </v>
<v Speaker 1>similarities,</v>

22
00:01:06.121 --> 00:01:06.954
<v Speaker 1>but they're not mutually intelligible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The history of the Kurdish language is </v>

23
00:01:09.661 --> 00:01:12.330
<v Speaker 1>the subject of much speculation for much</v>
<v Speaker 1>of its history.</v>

24
00:01:12.331 --> 00:01:14.640
<v Speaker 1>The Kurdish language was not a written </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

25
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:15.523
<v Speaker 1>Folk Tales and poetry were passed down </v>
<v Speaker 1>orally from generation to generations </v>

26
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.403
<v Speaker 1>with few exceptions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The earliest written Kurdish texts come </v>

27
00:01:21.631 --> 00:01:22.464
<v Speaker 1>from the 15th century and later there </v>
<v Speaker 1>was one known poem from the seventh </v>

28
00:01:25.441 --> 00:01:27.570
<v Speaker 1>century written in the garden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He dialect,</v>

29
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.183
<v Speaker 1>but technically the granny dialect is </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually a separate language from </v>

30
00:01:31.951 --> 00:01:32.940
<v Speaker 1>Kurdish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

31
00:01:32.941 --> 00:01:34.230
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is getting confusing.</v>

32
00:01:34.231 --> 00:01:36.930
<v Speaker 1>Let me back up for a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the Kurdish language?</v>

33
00:01:36.931 --> 00:01:40.650
<v Speaker 1>Is that one unified language that all </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kurdish people can understand and speak?</v>

34
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:41.850
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not really.</v>

35
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.750
<v Speaker 1>It's a collection of related dialects </v>
<v Speaker 1>spread out across a continuum,</v>

36
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.290
<v Speaker 1>meaning that the language changes </v>
<v Speaker 1>gradually over a geographic distance.</v>

37
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.630
<v Speaker 1>There are three main dialect groups of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kurdish.</v>

38
00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.110
<v Speaker 1>Could Umangi Sorta Tony and pat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hello honey.</v>

39
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.620
<v Speaker 1>The most widely spoken is could Umangi </v>
<v Speaker 1>with around 20 million native speakers.</v>

40
00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:59.633
<v Speaker 1>It is the major dialects spoken in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Turkey as well as in Syria and some </v>

41
00:02:02.581 --> 00:02:03.414
<v Speaker 1>parts of Iraq and parts of Iran.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second most widely spoken is sorta </v>

42
00:02:07.081 --> 00:02:09.750
<v Speaker 1>knee with six or 7 million native </v>
<v Speaker 1>speakers,</v>

43
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:10.613
<v Speaker 1>mainly in Iraq and Iran.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The third most widely spoken is hello </v>

44
00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:15.043
<v Speaker 1>ani,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is spoken by about 3 million </v>

45
00:02:16.531 --> 00:02:20.310
<v Speaker 1>people in some Kurdish areas in Iran and</v>
<v Speaker 1>one district in Iraqi Kurdistan.</v>

46
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.020
<v Speaker 1>These three dialects have a relatively </v>
<v Speaker 1>low degree of mutual intelligibility,</v>

47
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.830
<v Speaker 1>so some people consider them to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinct languages and not just dialects</v>

48
00:02:28.831 --> 00:02:29.664
<v Speaker 1>of one language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The differences between these dialects </v>

49
00:02:31.411 --> 00:02:32.244
<v Speaker 1>have been compounded by the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Kurds are spread out across several </v>

50
00:02:34.711 --> 00:02:38.880
<v Speaker 1>different countries and have no central </v>
<v Speaker 1>media or a school system and haven't had</v>

51
00:02:38.881 --> 00:02:39.714
<v Speaker 1>much interaction with the other areas of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kurdistan and there has also been some </v>

52
00:02:42.511 --> 00:02:45.360
<v Speaker 1>influence from the official languages of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the countries where they live.</v>

53
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.060
<v Speaker 1>Could Umangi is written in a Latin </v>
<v Speaker 1>alphabet like Turkish,</v>

54
00:02:48.061 --> 00:02:48.894
<v Speaker 1>while [inaudible] is written in a pair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so Arabic script Atla one is written in </v>

55
00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.973
<v Speaker 1>either script on top of these main </v>
<v Speaker 1>critic dialects or critic languages </v>

56
00:02:56.281 --> 00:02:57.114
<v Speaker 1>depending on how you look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were also some other languages by </v>

57
00:02:59.561 --> 00:03:01.680
<v Speaker 1>some Kurds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a few million Kurds speaky.</v>

58
00:03:01.681 --> 00:03:02.514
<v Speaker 1>There's as that or go annie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which form a separate sub branch of the </v>

59
00:03:05.381 --> 00:03:06.214
<v Speaker 1>northwestern Iranian languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're still quite closely related to </v>

60
00:03:09.221 --> 00:03:11.950
<v Speaker 1>the Kurdish dialect and since they are </v>
<v Speaker 1>spoken by Kurds,</v>

61
00:03:11.951 --> 00:03:15.820
<v Speaker 1>some people consider them to be Kurdish </v>
<v Speaker 1>dialects for reasons related to cultural</v>

62
00:03:15.821 --> 00:03:16.870
<v Speaker 1>and ethnic identity.</v>

63
00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:18.773
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

64
00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.470
<v Speaker 1>A big part of the story of Kurdish is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the desire for linguistic freedom.</v>

65
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:23.633
<v Speaker 1>In Turkey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Kurdish language was heavily </v>

66
00:03:24.601 --> 00:03:25.434
<v Speaker 1>suppressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For decades it was illegal to print </v>

67
00:03:27.091 --> 00:03:27.924
<v Speaker 1>Kurdish language materials.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a prohibited language and </v>

68
00:03:30.351 --> 00:03:31.184
<v Speaker 1>government institutions and schools and </v>
<v Speaker 1>in public it was prohibited to speak it </v>

69
00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.630
<v Speaker 1>even though not everyone followed that </v>
<v Speaker 1>rule in public.</v>

70
00:03:36.631 --> 00:03:37.464
<v Speaker 1>That was the rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These days those policies have been </v>

71
00:03:39.061 --> 00:03:39.894
<v Speaker 1>relaxed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Kurds still wants certain freedoms </v>

72
00:03:41.281 --> 00:03:42.114
<v Speaker 1>like the right to use the Kurdish </v>
<v Speaker 1>language as the language of instruction </v>

73
00:03:44.311 --> 00:03:45.144
<v Speaker 1>and regional schools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a similar situation in Syria </v>

74
00:03:47.521 --> 00:03:50.640
<v Speaker 1>and Iraq where the language was made </v>
<v Speaker 1>illegal and heavily suppressed.</v>

75
00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.580
<v Speaker 1>From what I understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iran has not aggressively suppressed the</v>

76
00:03:53.581 --> 00:03:55.380
<v Speaker 1>Kurdish language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they have discouraged.</v>

77
00:03:55.381 --> 00:03:58.380
<v Speaker 1>It's use and promoted assimilation to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Persian language.</v>

78
00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.580
<v Speaker 1>There was one country where Kurdish is </v>
<v Speaker 1>an official language and that is Iraq.</v>

79
00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:03.533
<v Speaker 1>And there was one area where Kurds have </v>
<v Speaker 1>official autonomy and that's in Iraqi </v>

80
00:04:06.601 --> 00:04:07.434
<v Speaker 1>Kurdistan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is run by the Kurdish regional </v>

81
00:04:08.791 --> 00:04:09.624
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are Kurdish is the language of </v>

82
00:04:10.711 --> 00:04:11.544
<v Speaker 1>instruction in schools and it's used in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the media since there are speakers of </v>

83
00:04:15.541 --> 00:04:18.420
<v Speaker 1>both Karangi and Serani dialects in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Iraqi Kurdistan,</v>

84
00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.120
<v Speaker 1>the government promotes both of them in </v>
<v Speaker 1>schools and in the media.</v>

85
00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.360
<v Speaker 1>There was now also another defacto </v>
<v Speaker 1>autonomous Kurdish region,</v>

86
00:04:24.361 --> 00:04:25.194
<v Speaker 1>and that is in Syria and Kurdistan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is known as Brittle Java due to the </v>

87
00:04:27.991 --> 00:04:28.824
<v Speaker 1>civil war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Syrian government is no longer in </v>

88
00:04:30.271 --> 00:04:31.104
<v Speaker 1>control of the area and all restrictions</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the Kurdish language are now </v>

89
00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:34.523
<v Speaker 1>irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Schools have introduced a new Kurdish </v>

90
00:04:36.091 --> 00:04:37.620
<v Speaker 1>curriculum taught in Kurdish.</v>

91
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.780
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

92
00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:39.613
<v Speaker 1>The form of Kurdish used in Syria and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kurdistan is Kurmanji with Kurdish </v>

93
00:04:42.711 --> 00:04:47.030
<v Speaker 1>autonomy and Kurdish language schools </v>
<v Speaker 1>now existing in both Iraq and in Syria,</v>

94
00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.073
<v Speaker 1>the curtis language might become </v>
<v Speaker 1>stronger and more standardized in the </v>

95
00:04:50.331 --> 00:04:52.460
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what exactly is Kurdish like?</v>

96
00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:53.383
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that depends on what variety of Kurdish </v>

97
00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.313
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's take a look at both could </v>

98
00:04:56.401 --> 00:04:58.400
<v Speaker 1>Umangi and after that we'll look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorta Annie.</v>

99
00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.953
<v Speaker 1>Here are a few interesting features of </v>
<v Speaker 1>could Umangi could a bungee nouns are </v>

100
00:05:02.421 --> 00:05:05.000
<v Speaker 1>all either masculine or feminine and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are four.</v>

101
00:05:05.001 --> 00:05:07.970
<v Speaker 1>Now in cases it is generally an Sov </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

102
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.160
<v Speaker 1>They'll certain sentences are Svo put </v>
<v Speaker 1>'em on.</v>

103
00:05:10.161 --> 00:05:10.994
<v Speaker 1>Ge has something called Ergot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tivity could Mangi has prepositions and </v>

104
00:05:13.821 --> 00:05:17.030
<v Speaker 1>post positions and it also has something</v>
<v Speaker 1>called circle positions.</v>

105
00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.380
<v Speaker 1>Let's have a look at the nouns and their</v>
<v Speaker 1>cases first could Manji has four.</v>

106
00:05:20.381 --> 00:05:21.214
<v Speaker 1>Now in cases nominative or bleak </v>
<v Speaker 1>construct and Vocativ the case endings </v>

107
00:05:24.201 --> 00:05:26.810
<v Speaker 1>are different depending on the gender </v>
<v Speaker 1>and number of the knelt.</v>

108
00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.450
<v Speaker 1>Here's an example with the word for men,</v>

109
00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.840
<v Speaker 2>middle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>middle of the row,</v>

110
00:05:32.841 --> 00:05:33.900
<v Speaker 2>v,</v>
<v Speaker 2>neuro,</v>

111
00:05:33.901 --> 00:05:35.220
<v Speaker 2>Vicky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>neuro,</v>

112
00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:38.660
<v Speaker 2>neuro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>neuro,</v>

113
00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:40.110
<v Speaker 2>Vin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the roof.</v>

114
00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:41.970
<v Speaker 2>Name Neuro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

115
00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:46.410
<v Speaker 1>Now here's an example of using the word </v>
<v Speaker 1>for Woman Jin.</v>

116
00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:51.920
<v Speaker 2>Ginny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just you know Janeka Ginny Shin,</v>

117
00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.510
<v Speaker 2>she none.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shinon Junin [inaudible],</v>

118
00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:58.383
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

119
00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:58.920
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>

120
00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:59.753
<v Speaker 4>You may have noticed that the plural </v>
<v Speaker 4>case endings are the same for both </v>

121
00:06:01.891 --> 00:06:05.370
<v Speaker 4>genders because it could Umangi gender </v>
<v Speaker 4>applies only to singular nouns,</v>

122
00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:06.750
<v Speaker 4>not to plural nouns.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

123
00:06:06.751 --> 00:06:07.584
<v Speaker 4>let's look at some examples,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sentences and could Umangi here we'll </v>

124
00:06:09.811 --> 00:06:11.820
<v Speaker 4>see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That could Umangi is generally sov.</v>

125
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.300
<v Speaker 3>This means I see the men,</v>

126
00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.273
<v Speaker 4>middle one dabine him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if we translate this sentence </v>

127
00:06:18.771 --> 00:06:20.990
<v Speaker 4>directly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like Aye man.</v>

128
00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.883
<v Speaker 4>C as equals I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>middle of equals man and is the oblique </v>

129
00:06:26.661 --> 00:06:27.494
<v Speaker 4>case marker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And also the plural marker and to be </v>

130
00:06:29.211 --> 00:06:33.590
<v Speaker 4>name is c so you can see that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>sentences Sov with the object coming in.</v>

131
00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:34.453
<v Speaker 4>The middle positions I'm quoted in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this means we are Kurdish or we are </v>

132
00:06:40.431 --> 00:06:41.264
<v Speaker 4>Kurds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If we tried to translate this sentence </v>

133
00:06:42.651 --> 00:06:45.920
<v Speaker 4>directly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like we Kurds are m equals,</v>

134
00:06:45.921 --> 00:06:50.450
<v Speaker 4>we couldn't equals curd in equals r.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the present tense Copula.</v>

135
00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.370
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can see that this is Sov.</v>

136
00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.620
<v Speaker 4>The sentence doesn't actually have an </v>
<v Speaker 4>object,</v>

137
00:06:54.621 --> 00:06:55.454
<v Speaker 4>but it has something called a compliment</v>
<v Speaker 4>which comes in the same position as the </v>

138
00:06:58.011 --> 00:06:58.844
<v Speaker 4>object.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now why does the Noun in the first </v>

139
00:07:00.051 --> 00:07:02.120
<v Speaker 4>sentence happen?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ending on it marked in yellow,</v>

140
00:07:02.121 --> 00:07:02.954
<v Speaker 4>but in the second sentence there isn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>one and that's because nominative case </v>

141
00:07:05.481 --> 00:07:08.240
<v Speaker 4>has no ending in either singular or </v>
<v Speaker 4>plural and good manji.</v>

142
00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:12.410
<v Speaker 4>So we only know it's plural from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>context and hear the context is that the</v>

143
00:07:12.411 --> 00:07:14.330
<v Speaker 4>subject is we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so we know what's plural.</v>

144
00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:17.900
<v Speaker 4>Could Umangi exhibit something called </v>
<v Speaker 4>Ergot?</v>

145
00:07:17.901 --> 00:07:18.734
<v Speaker 4>Tivity in ergots of languages,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the subject of a verb sometimes </v>

146
00:07:21.231 --> 00:07:23.540
<v Speaker 4>functions as though it's the object of a</v>
<v Speaker 4>sentence.</v>

147
00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:24.523
<v Speaker 4>It could Umangi.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This happens when the verb is in one of </v>

148
00:07:26.031 --> 00:07:29.900
<v Speaker 4>the past tenses.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The agent that is the doer of the action</v>

149
00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:30.763
<v Speaker 4>is in the oblique case,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like an object and the patient that is </v>

150
00:07:33.891 --> 00:07:36.560
<v Speaker 4>the receiver of the action is in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>nominative case,</v>

151
00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:37.543
<v Speaker 4>like a subject.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The verb then takes an ending to agree </v>

152
00:07:40.101 --> 00:07:40.934
<v Speaker 4>with the patient.</v>

153
00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.280
<v Speaker 3>Men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh deet.</v>

154
00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:47.700
<v Speaker 4>We would translate this as I saw him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's more like by me.</v>

155
00:07:47.701 --> 00:07:50.700
<v Speaker 4>He was seen literally word for word.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's me.</v>

156
00:07:50.701 --> 00:07:51.534
<v Speaker 4>He saw,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the verb ending confirms that he is </v>

157
00:07:53.701 --> 00:07:57.690
<v Speaker 4>actually the receiver of the action.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We as dictum,</v>

158
00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:02.370
<v Speaker 4>this means he saw me or by him I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>seeing word by word.</v>

159
00:08:02.371 --> 00:08:03.780
<v Speaker 4>It's him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw,</v>

160
00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:04.673
<v Speaker 4>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the verb ending confirms that I as the </v>

161
00:08:06.691 --> 00:08:07.524
<v Speaker 4>receiver of the action.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So here him as the ending for the first </v>

162
00:08:09.901 --> 00:08:12.660
<v Speaker 4>person singular and that matches the </v>
<v Speaker 4>patient of the sentence.</v>

163
00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.190
<v Speaker 4>And that's I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in this case,</v>

164
00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:17.220
<v Speaker 4>I find ergotism it quite difficult to </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrap my head around.</v>

165
00:08:17.221 --> 00:08:19.620
<v Speaker 4>It's not founded most Indo European </v>
<v Speaker 4>languages.</v>

166
00:08:19.621 --> 00:08:20.454
<v Speaker 4>It's found in Kurdish,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's found in Pashto and it's founded </v>

167
00:08:22.561 --> 00:08:24.600
<v Speaker 4>some of the northern Indian languages.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

168
00:08:24.601 --> 00:08:26.700
<v Speaker 4>If we want to make that last sentence </v>
<v Speaker 4>negative,</v>

169
00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:29.340
<v Speaker 4>we simply add a negative prefix to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>verb.</v>

170
00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:34.230
<v Speaker 4>We as Ned Itam,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this means he didn't see me.</v>

171
00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.153
<v Speaker 4>This is an example of how it could </v>
<v Speaker 4>Umangi uses lots of different affixes </v>

172
00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:42.990
<v Speaker 4>could Umangi has prepositions which come</v>
<v Speaker 4>before noun phrases or pronouns and post</v>

173
00:08:42.991 --> 00:08:45.570
<v Speaker 4>positions which come after noun phrases </v>
<v Speaker 4>or pronouns.</v>

174
00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:46.583
<v Speaker 4>But it also has circle positions which </v>
<v Speaker 4>wraparound the noun or pronoun or the </v>

175
00:08:49.801 --> 00:08:51.840
<v Speaker 4>entire Noun phrase.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For example,</v>

176
00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:56.010
<v Speaker 3>the bed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This means in front of the bed,</v>

177
00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:56.973
<v Speaker 4>Marlo Darek care.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This means there's a tree in front of </v>

178
00:09:00.601 --> 00:09:01.434
<v Speaker 4>our house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if we try to read the sentence word </v>

179
00:09:03.031 --> 00:09:05.010
<v Speaker 4>by word,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's in front house,</v>

180
00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:08.400
<v Speaker 4>hour of tree,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is now,</v>

181
00:09:08.401 --> 00:09:10.890
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if have is the part that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>should have separated,</v>

182
00:09:10.891 --> 00:09:11.724
<v Speaker 4>but the point there is that in front of </v>
<v Speaker 4>is split into two pieces and surrounds </v>

183
00:09:14.821 --> 00:09:17.790
<v Speaker 4>the noun phrase.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now let's look at some of those.</v>

184
00:09:17.791 --> 00:09:18.624
<v Speaker 4>Could Umangi sentences again and we'll </v>
<v Speaker 4>compare them to some sorta nice </v>

185
00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:22.280
<v Speaker 4>sentences.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>

186
00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:25.300
<v Speaker 4>here are the sentences for ic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the men in Guzman,</v>

187
00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:29.470
<v Speaker 4>g as literal one dabine him in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So Danny.</v>

188
00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:35.700
<v Speaker 4>Now one difference that you can see is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that the preposition is different in the</v>

189
00:09:35.701 --> 00:09:36.534
<v Speaker 4>two different languages.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So in could Umangi it's as that means I </v>

190
00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:42.780
<v Speaker 4>but in [inaudible] it's mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why does it mean?</v>

191
00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:43.823
<v Speaker 4>Well in [inaudible] men is the first </v>
<v Speaker 4>person singular pronoun in the Oblique </v>

192
00:09:46.981 --> 00:09:47.814
<v Speaker 4>case,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like an object Pronoun while as is the </v>

193
00:09:49.711 --> 00:09:50.544
<v Speaker 4>nominative case.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But in sort I need the pronouns have no </v>

194
00:09:52.501 --> 00:09:53.334
<v Speaker 4>cases.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's just one word and that word </v>

195
00:09:54.931 --> 00:09:58.200
<v Speaker 4>has been another different word here is </v>
<v Speaker 4>pll con,</v>

196
00:09:58.230 --> 00:09:59.063
<v Speaker 4>which is the word for man in I need,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's different from the could Manji </v>

197
00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:02.663
<v Speaker 4>word Middot van.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think this is just an alternate word </v>

198
00:10:04.411 --> 00:10:05.244
<v Speaker 4>for man in [inaudible] I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I need the word middle of means </v>

199
00:10:07.591 --> 00:10:09.000
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>More as inhuman.</v>

200
00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:11.520
<v Speaker 4>Now both words for men here have the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ending on,</v>

201
00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:13.650
<v Speaker 4>but it's actually different in both </v>
<v Speaker 4>languages.</v>

202
00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:16.500
<v Speaker 4>In could Manji it's the oblique case,</v>
<v Speaker 4>plural marker.</v>

203
00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:19.110
<v Speaker 4>But and so the need,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are no cases so and so donny,</v>

204
00:10:19.111 --> 00:10:19.944
<v Speaker 4>it's just the general plural marker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now the sentences for we are Kurds in </v>

205
00:10:24.931 --> 00:10:28.960
<v Speaker 4>could Umangi quoted then and in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So Danny,</v>

206
00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:32.550
<v Speaker 4>now here again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can see that the pronoun is different</v>

207
00:10:32.551 --> 00:10:35.160
<v Speaker 4>in the two languages.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the first person plural pronoun.</v>

208
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:36.150
<v Speaker 4>But in putting on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gee,</v>

209
00:10:36.151 --> 00:10:38.460
<v Speaker 4>it's m and then saw danny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's Emma.</v>

210
00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:41.550
<v Speaker 4>And in both languages we have the </v>
<v Speaker 4>present tense Copula in.</v>

211
00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:44.230
<v Speaker 4>The only difference here is the </v>
<v Speaker 4>orthography and could on,</v>

212
00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:45.990
<v Speaker 4>gee,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a space before the coffee love.</v>

213
00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:50.490
<v Speaker 4>Now the sentences for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw him in good Umangi men.</v>

214
00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:55.790
<v Speaker 4>Oh deet and in Solani mean own Dick,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these sentences look quite similar.</v>

215
00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:57.143
<v Speaker 4>The sorani sentence has an extra m </v>
<v Speaker 4>attached to the object of the sentence </v>

216
00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:04.930
<v Speaker 4>that m is actually an ethics </v>
<v Speaker 4>representing the subject in a soda.</v>

217
00:11:04.931 --> 00:11:06.030
<v Speaker 4>Any pass 10 sentence.</v>

218
00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:09.030
<v Speaker 4>The subject is represented as an ethics </v>
<v Speaker 4>before the verb.</v>

219
00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:11.940
<v Speaker 4>Here the subject is also stated overtly </v>
<v Speaker 4>as men,</v>

220
00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:14.960
<v Speaker 4>but the sentence is possible without </v>
<v Speaker 4>that first word in court.</v>

221
00:11:14.961 --> 00:11:19.680
<v Speaker 4>Manji it's not like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now the sentences for he saw me in could</v>

222
00:11:19.681 --> 00:11:24.681
<v Speaker 4>Umangi we as dictum and in so Danny Oh </v>
<v Speaker 4>money.</v>

223
00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:26.393
<v Speaker 4>This example is similar to the last one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can see that the pronouns are </v>

224
00:11:29.161 --> 00:11:32.730
<v Speaker 4>different and Sony,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because Sony has no case distinction and</v>

225
00:11:32.731 --> 00:11:33.564
<v Speaker 4>we can see that and put them on g.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The verb has an ending that the Sadhana </v>

226
00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:38.940
<v Speaker 4>verb doesn't have in the chronology </v>
<v Speaker 4>sentence and objects.</v>

227
00:11:38.941 --> 00:11:40.920
<v Speaker 4>Suffix is attached to the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>verb.</v>

228
00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:42.450
<v Speaker 4>And so Dani,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the other hand,</v>

229
00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:47.480
<v Speaker 4>a subject affix is added before the verb</v>
<v Speaker 4>and here are the sentences for he didn't</v>

230
00:11:47.941 --> 00:11:52.941
<v Speaker 4>see me in [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 4>We as [inaudible] and in Daneen.</v>

231
00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:54.043
<v Speaker 4>Oh [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now this sentence is basically the same </v>

232
00:11:56.441 --> 00:11:58.150
<v Speaker 4>as the last one except that it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>negative.</v>

233
00:11:58.210 --> 00:11:59.043
<v Speaker 4>And we can see that put them on g and </v>
<v Speaker 4>Sorta knee using negation in the same </v>

234
00:12:01.361 --> 00:12:02.194
<v Speaker 4>way she wrote the sentences for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a tree in front of our house in </v>

235
00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:07.043
<v Speaker 4>could Umangi the bed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Marlo Medda Dora care and in saw </v>

236
00:12:11.361 --> 00:12:13.810
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] that it kid Lebron </v>
<v Speaker 4>Guatemala.</v>

237
00:12:13.811 --> 00:12:14.644
<v Speaker 4>Come on in the quarter Manji sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have a circle position that wraps </v>

238
00:12:17.681 --> 00:12:20.290
<v Speaker 4>around the noun phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but in the sorta and he's sentenced,</v>

239
00:12:20.291 --> 00:12:21.124
<v Speaker 4>there is a preposition that comes before</v>
<v Speaker 4>the noun phrase and the preposition </v>

240
00:12:23.871 --> 00:12:24.704
<v Speaker 4>that's totally different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the noun phrase itself is also </v>

241
00:12:26.651 --> 00:12:27.484
<v Speaker 4>somewhat different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My love means house and could Umangi </v>

242
00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:33.910
<v Speaker 4>while model means house and sorta need </v>
<v Speaker 4>and may means hour increment g one.</v>

243
00:12:33.911 --> 00:12:34.744
<v Speaker 4>And so donny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yet mun the egg after mal is an </v>

244
00:12:37.241 --> 00:12:38.074
<v Speaker 4>indefinite article which doesn't exist </v>
<v Speaker 4>in [inaudible] and the [inaudible] is a </v>

245
00:12:41.021 --> 00:12:43.630
<v Speaker 4>connector which also isn't used in </v>
<v Speaker 4>liquid laundry sentence.</v>

246
00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:47.810
<v Speaker 4>So as you can see there are some </v>
<v Speaker 4>significant differences between couldn't</v>

247
00:12:47.811 --> 00:12:48.880
<v Speaker 4>Manji and sorta knee.</v>

248
00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:50.990
<v Speaker 1>So which variety of Curtis should you </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn?</v>

249
00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:51.943
<v Speaker 1>Well if you're planning on spending some</v>
<v Speaker 1>time in the Kurdistan region than it </v>

250
00:12:54.021 --> 00:12:57.200
<v Speaker 1>would make sense to learn the variety of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the place where you planned to spend the</v>

251
00:12:57.201 --> 00:12:58.034
<v Speaker 1>most time and in the future you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>always learn to adapt and speak a </v>

252
00:13:00.411 --> 00:13:01.244
<v Speaker 1>different dialect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By extension is Kurdish at difficult </v>

253
00:13:03.261 --> 00:13:04.340
<v Speaker 1>language to learn?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

254
00:13:04.341 --> 00:13:07.880
<v Speaker 1>there are some things like urgh activity</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are probably challenging for people</v>

255
00:13:07.881 --> 00:13:08.714
<v Speaker 1>who have never encountered them before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but probably some of the most </v>

256
00:13:11.121 --> 00:13:11.954
<v Speaker 1>challenging things will be the dialectal</v>
<v Speaker 1>variation in the language and the lack </v>

257
00:13:14.991 --> 00:13:19.190
<v Speaker 1>of a single standard language as well as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a general lack of learning materials.</v>

258
00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:21.050
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from what I understand,</v>

259
00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:21.913
<v Speaker 1>if you have a previous knowledge of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Persian that will help you a great deal </v>

260
00:13:24.291 --> 00:13:25.124
<v Speaker 1>in learning Kurdish and critics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are also all very welcoming and </v>

261
00:13:28.131 --> 00:13:28.964
<v Speaker 1>friendly and very enthusiastic about </v>
<v Speaker 1>helping you to learn their language and </v>

262
00:13:31.671 --> 00:13:33.860
<v Speaker 1>that kind of support is always very </v>
<v Speaker 1>encouraging.</v>

263
00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:34.933
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question of the day for Curtis </v>

264
00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:37.013
<v Speaker 1>speakers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how easy is it for you to communicate </v>

265
00:13:38.721 --> 00:13:40.880
<v Speaker 1>with speakers of other varieties of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kurdish?</v>

266
00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:43.700
<v Speaker 1>And do you consider them all dialects of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a single language,</v>

267
00:13:43.701 --> 00:13:45.650
<v Speaker 1>or do you consider them distinct </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages?</v>

268
00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:46.753
<v Speaker 1>And for people who've studied Kurdish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did you find challenging about the </v>

269
00:13:49.161 --> 00:13:49.994
<v Speaker 1>language and in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was your experience with the </v>

270
00:13:51.861 --> 00:13:52.694
<v Speaker 1>language?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd like to hear about it in the </v>
