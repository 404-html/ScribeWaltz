00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:00.983
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and </v>

2
00:00:02.821 --> 00:00:06.390
<v Speaker 1>my name is Paul today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not a feature video.</v>

3
00:00:06.391 --> 00:00:07.224
<v Speaker 1>This is just a special video in which </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to make a little announcement </v>

4
00:00:09.601 --> 00:00:13.230
<v Speaker 1>and then I'm going to answer some </v>
<v Speaker 1>frequently asked questions that a lot of</v>

5
00:00:13.231 --> 00:00:17.640
<v Speaker 1>people ask me in the comments of videos </v>
<v Speaker 1>and also in private messages.</v>

6
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:18.653
<v Speaker 1>So the first announcement that I want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make is that I have created a patriotic </v>

7
00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:23.483
<v Speaker 1>account.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now maybe you don't know what Patrion </v>

8
00:00:25.141 --> 00:00:25.974
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Patrion is a service that allows you to </v>

9
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:28.763
<v Speaker 1>basically support your favorite youtube </v>
<v Speaker 1>creators by pledging to give them a </v>

10
00:00:32.521 --> 00:00:36.720
<v Speaker 1>certain amount of money each month and </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of money that you decide.</v>

11
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.320
<v Speaker 1>Now I want to say right away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to do this.</v>

12
00:00:40.321 --> 00:00:41.154
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to give any money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is basically like a voluntary </v>

13
00:00:44.101 --> 00:00:46.800
<v Speaker 1>subscription feed that you can pay if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you want,</v>

14
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.790
<v Speaker 1>but the amount is up to you so it can be</v>
<v Speaker 1>as little as $1.</v>

15
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:51.623
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the cool things about </v>
<v Speaker 1>Patrion is that everyone can give just </v>

16
00:00:54.601 --> 00:00:55.950
<v Speaker 1>$1,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not everyone,</v>

17
00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:56.843
<v Speaker 1>but if you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can give $1 and if a lot of people </v>

18
00:00:59.071 --> 00:00:59.904
<v Speaker 1>give $1,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that amount of money kind of adds </v>

19
00:01:01.621 --> 00:01:03.210
<v Speaker 1>up in the creator gets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

20
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.430
<v Speaker 1>a significant amount.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the cool thing about it.</v>

21
00:01:05.431 --> 00:01:09.750
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of a collective way to support</v>
<v Speaker 1>your favorite creators as a team.</v>

22
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:10.703
<v Speaker 1>So the reason I'm doing that is because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've put in a lot of time and effort </v>

23
00:01:13.591 --> 00:01:14.424
<v Speaker 1>into making the videos and basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot of time that I could be </v>

24
00:01:17.401 --> 00:01:20.220
<v Speaker 1>putting into different work that pay </v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

25
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.280
<v Speaker 1>I do get a little bit of money from some</v>
<v Speaker 1>advertising on youtube,</v>

26
00:01:23.281 --> 00:01:26.070
<v Speaker 1>but it's just a small amount.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not really a lot,</v>

27
00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because according to my statistics,</v>

28
00:01:28.741 --> 00:01:32.370
<v Speaker 1>about 70% of people use ad blockers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's okay.</v>

29
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.770
<v Speaker 1>I don't really mind if you do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's up to you.</v>

30
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.690
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is all voluntary.</v>

31
00:01:36.691 --> 00:01:39.570
<v Speaker 1>If you want to support the channel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Patrion is a way to do that.</v>

32
00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.030
<v Speaker 1>Even if you like to use an ad blocker or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

33
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.893
<v Speaker 1>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically have a look at the Patrion </v>

34
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:45.773
<v Speaker 1>page that I've created.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you think that Lang focus deserves a </v>

35
00:01:48.601 --> 00:01:49.434
<v Speaker 1>little donation every month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a dollar or whatever you want to give </v>

36
00:01:51.481 --> 00:01:53.610
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be highly appreciated.</v>

37
00:01:53.611 --> 00:01:54.444
<v Speaker 1>But if not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then don't worry about it because I'll </v>

38
00:01:55.981 --> 00:01:56.814
<v Speaker 1>still love you just as much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She'll still be a valued viewer and all </v>

39
00:01:59.941 --> 00:02:01.620
<v Speaker 1>of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so don't even stress about it.</v>

40
00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:02.543
<v Speaker 1>It's completely voluntary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the link to that Patrion page is </v>

41
00:02:05.461 --> 00:02:06.294
<v Speaker 1>down below in the description.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So onto a few frequently asked </v>

42
00:02:09.901 --> 00:02:10.734
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the first frequently asked question </v>

43
00:02:12.451 --> 00:02:13.111
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paul,</v>

44
00:02:13.111 --> 00:02:15.120
<v Speaker 1>how many languages do you speak?</v>

45
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.750
<v Speaker 1>Now this is a strange question to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>asked because it kind of feels like,</v>

46
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:19.763
<v Speaker 1>because I'm making the videos that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people think I'm a language master or a </v>

47
00:02:22.771 --> 00:02:26.670
<v Speaker 1>language guru or one of those things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't think of myself like that.</v>

48
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:27.523
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I'm a language master.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just someone who's very passionate </v>

49
00:02:30.031 --> 00:02:32.010
<v Speaker 1>about languages and very interested in </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

50
00:02:32.011 --> 00:02:35.460
<v Speaker 1>And I'm also very passionate about </v>
<v Speaker 1>learning because the teacher,</v>

51
00:02:35.461 --> 00:02:36.294
<v Speaker 1>but also I just love learning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I know why people are asking that </v>

52
00:02:38.941 --> 00:02:41.040
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'll try to give you my answer.</v>

53
00:02:41.041 --> 00:02:42.720
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you which language is that.</v>

54
00:02:42.721 --> 00:02:45.750
<v Speaker 1>I've basically invested a lot of time </v>
<v Speaker 1>into studying that.</v>

55
00:02:45.751 --> 00:02:46.584
<v Speaker 1>I've studied in depth in that I have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>significant amount of knowledge of it </v>

56
00:02:49.471 --> 00:02:51.780
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean I'm really advanced that </v>
<v Speaker 1>those languages,</v>

57
00:02:51.781 --> 00:02:54.600
<v Speaker 1>but it means I put that time and effort </v>
<v Speaker 1>into them.</v>

58
00:02:54.601 --> 00:02:58.260
<v Speaker 1>So the first one that I studied back in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the day was Hebrew.</v>

59
00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.273
<v Speaker 1>In University I studied biblical Hebrew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in my free time I also studied </v>

60
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.720
<v Speaker 1>modern Hebrew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also studied biblical,</v>

61
00:03:04.721 --> 00:03:05.554
<v Speaker 1>Aramaic and university and at the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>time I studied old English or Anglo </v>

62
00:03:08.501 --> 00:03:09.334
<v Speaker 1>Saxon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we can throw that in there and it's </v>

63
00:03:10.421 --> 00:03:12.670
<v Speaker 1>not a spoken language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'll throw that in there.</v>

64
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.863
<v Speaker 1>I've also studied Arabic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I studied modern standard Arabic and </v>

65
00:03:16.181 --> 00:03:17.014
<v Speaker 1>also some Arabic dialects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically Palestinian and to some </v>

66
00:03:20.141 --> 00:03:23.830
<v Speaker 1>extent Egyptian as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've also of course studied Japanese.</v>

67
00:03:23.831 --> 00:03:24.664
<v Speaker 1>As you might know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I live in Japan and I've been studying </v>

68
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.920
<v Speaker 1>Japanese for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've also studied Indonesian.</v>

69
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.250
<v Speaker 1>I've also studied French.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've also studied tagalog.</v>

70
00:03:33.251 --> 00:03:37.690
<v Speaker 1>I've also studied Esperanto and I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>also recently been studying Italian.</v>

71
00:03:37.691 --> 00:03:38.524
<v Speaker 1>So those are the ones I've really put </v>
<v Speaker 1>time and effort into studying quite a </v>

72
00:03:41.501 --> 00:03:43.360
<v Speaker 1>lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I'm forgetting any,</v>

73
00:03:43.361 --> 00:03:45.460
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's probably the main ones.</v>

74
00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.100
<v Speaker 1>There are other languages that I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>studied to a basic level,</v>

75
00:03:48.101 --> 00:03:50.920
<v Speaker 1>but I don't really know them enough to </v>
<v Speaker 1>say that I know them.</v>

76
00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.530
<v Speaker 1>And there are some languages that I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>also read.</v>

77
00:03:53.531 --> 00:03:57.010
<v Speaker 1>Like I have passive knowledge of them </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I've studied related languages,</v>

78
00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.160
<v Speaker 1>but I've never specifically studied </v>
<v Speaker 1>those languages themselves.</v>

79
00:04:00.161 --> 00:04:02.410
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese and Spanish,</v>

80
00:04:02.411 --> 00:04:03.244
<v Speaker 1>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can often make sense to them when I'm </v>

81
00:04:04.601 --> 00:04:06.580
<v Speaker 1>reading them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've never studied them.</v>

82
00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:07.653
<v Speaker 1>There are also other languages that I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>just studied from a linguistic point of </v>

83
00:04:10.271 --> 00:04:11.104
<v Speaker 1>view.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I want to see how those languages </v>

84
00:04:12.281 --> 00:04:13.114
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I examined them and sometimes the </v>

85
00:04:14.411 --> 00:04:17.080
<v Speaker 1>language profile videos I make are kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of like that.</v>

86
00:04:17.081 --> 00:04:19.120
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm just interested in those </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>

87
00:04:19.121 --> 00:04:22.390
<v Speaker 1>So I examine them and study and learn </v>
<v Speaker 1>about those languages.</v>

88
00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.850
<v Speaker 1>But I haven't necessarily studied those </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>

89
00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.540
<v Speaker 1>Basically I consider myself a language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enthusiasm,</v>

90
00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:28.930
<v Speaker 1>someone who loves languages.</v>

91
00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.973
<v Speaker 1>I don't call myself a polyglot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to make a video called </v>

92
00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.720
<v Speaker 1>Canadian guys speaks 25 languages or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

93
00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.050
<v Speaker 1>Like that's not really the purpose of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this channel.</v>

94
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.950
<v Speaker 1>That channel is called Lang focus </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I want to focus on the languages</v>

95
00:04:41.951 --> 00:04:42.784
<v Speaker 1>and not really on me and my own ability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another frequently asked question I get </v>

96
00:04:46.301 --> 00:04:47.980
<v Speaker 1>is Paul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you do for a living?</v>

97
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.930
<v Speaker 1>Is it related to languages?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

98
00:04:49.931 --> 00:04:50.950
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of a,</v>

99
00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.863
<v Speaker 1>I'm an instructor at a university and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>teach English as a foreign language to </v>

100
00:04:55.511 --> 00:04:56.344
<v Speaker 1>students in Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So originally part of the reason I made </v>

101
00:04:58.721 --> 00:04:59.554
<v Speaker 1>the length focus channel was kind of to </v>
<v Speaker 1>inspire my students so I have some </v>

102
00:05:02.261 --> 00:05:03.094
<v Speaker 1>videos to show them and I could show </v>
<v Speaker 1>them that my hobby is language learning </v>

103
00:05:06.071 --> 00:05:09.730
<v Speaker 1>and I could give them some extra </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation to work hard to study English</v>

104
00:05:09.731 --> 00:05:10.564
<v Speaker 1>because they could see that their </v>
<v Speaker 1>teacher is doing that to another </v>

105
00:05:13.061 --> 00:05:17.020
<v Speaker 1>frequently asked question I get is Paul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's your educational background?</v>

106
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.150
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have two university degrees.</v>

107
00:05:19.151 --> 00:05:24.010
<v Speaker 1>My first university degree was in </v>
<v Speaker 1>English with a linguistics focus.</v>

108
00:05:24.011 --> 00:05:24.844
<v Speaker 1>So it wasn't a literature degree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a linguistics degree in the </v>

109
00:05:27.131 --> 00:05:27.964
<v Speaker 1>English department.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that means I studied the history of </v>

110
00:05:30.281 --> 00:05:32.170
<v Speaker 1>English,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I studied English grammar,</v>

111
00:05:32.171 --> 00:05:33.004
<v Speaker 1>I studied English phonology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I studied a dialectal differences in </v>

112
00:05:36.131 --> 00:05:36.964
<v Speaker 1>English.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I studied all of those kinds of things </v>

113
00:05:38.381 --> 00:05:42.070
<v Speaker 1>about the English language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also had a minor in religious studies.</v>

114
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.933
<v Speaker 1>Basically all of my credits that went </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards that minor where courses in </v>

115
00:05:46.391 --> 00:05:47.224
<v Speaker 1>biblical Hebrew and Biblical Aramaic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to study those languages and I </v>

116
00:05:50.381 --> 00:05:51.214
<v Speaker 1>figured out that I could get a minor in </v>
<v Speaker 1>religious studies by just taking those </v>

117
00:05:54.431 --> 00:05:55.630
<v Speaker 1>courses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I did.</v>

118
00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:59.450
<v Speaker 1>I also have a second university degree </v>
<v Speaker 1>that one is in education.</v>

119
00:05:59.451 --> 00:06:00.284
<v Speaker 1>So after I finished my first degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went back to university and did a </v>

120
00:06:02.691 --> 00:06:06.860
<v Speaker 1>second degree in education and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>what allows me to be a teacher and do my</v>

121
00:06:06.861 --> 00:06:10.340
<v Speaker 1>current job at the university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's just a little bit about me.</v>

122
00:06:10.341 --> 00:06:11.174
<v Speaker 1>It seems like some of the viewers want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get to know a little bit more about </v>

123
