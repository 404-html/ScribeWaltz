00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:02.483
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for tuning into laying focus </v>

2
00:00:04.291 --> 00:00:05.124
<v Speaker 1>TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am your host Paul and today we're </v>

3
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:10.650
<v Speaker 1>going to talk about the difference </v>
<v Speaker 1>between informal and formal language and</v>

4
00:00:10.651 --> 00:00:14.040
<v Speaker 1>which one you should focus on learning </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're learning a new language.</v>

5
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.410
<v Speaker 1>We have two special guests with us </v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

6
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.210
<v Speaker 1>They both happened to be cousins of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mine.</v>

7
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.630
<v Speaker 1>One is my cousin Fred and the other is </v>
<v Speaker 1>my cousin Ivan.</v>

8
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.340
<v Speaker 1>So welcome to both of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>

9
00:00:23.341 --> 00:00:24.750
<v Speaker 1>what's up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

10
00:00:24.751 --> 00:00:25.584
<v Speaker 1>so let's start off by talking about some</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the differences between formal </v>

11
00:00:28.021 --> 00:00:28.854
<v Speaker 1>language and informal language and later</v>
<v Speaker 1>on we'll get into which one you should </v>

12
00:00:32.131 --> 00:00:34.170
<v Speaker 1>focus on learning when you learn a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

13
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.540
<v Speaker 1>So far more frank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to start with you.</v>

14
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:37.553
<v Speaker 1>Would you tell us a little bit about </v>
<v Speaker 1>formal language and how it differs from </v>

15
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.243
<v Speaker 1>informal language?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Formal speech usually mirrors the </v>

16
00:00:43.801 --> 00:00:46.380
<v Speaker 1>written language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when people are speaking formally,</v>

17
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.140
<v Speaker 1>they are speaking with the written </v>
<v Speaker 1>language in mind.</v>

18
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.033
<v Speaker 1>They might be seeing the sentences </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside their head as they are saying </v>

19
00:00:52.561 --> 00:00:54.720
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are keeping grammar and mind.</v>

20
00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:55.583
<v Speaker 1>They're conscious of grammar and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>constructing those sentences carefully </v>

21
00:00:58.111 --> 00:01:00.930
<v Speaker 1>to follow the rules of grammar that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>learned in school.</v>

22
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.590
<v Speaker 1>And they might be using some vocabulary </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they see written in books,</v>

23
00:01:04.591 --> 00:01:07.050
<v Speaker 1>but they don't usually use in casual </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>

24
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.980
<v Speaker 1>And maybe the most important thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most important differences that they</v>

25
00:01:10.981 --> 00:01:13.620
<v Speaker 1>are enunciating all of the words very </v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly.</v>

26
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.843
<v Speaker 1>So the people who find the formal </v>
<v Speaker 1>language quite easy to learn are people </v>

27
00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:21.090
<v Speaker 1>who are visual learners and people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are kind of analytical.</v>

28
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.780
<v Speaker 1>So that gets them thinking about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>different pieces of the sentence and how</v>

29
00:01:24.781 --> 00:01:25.614
<v Speaker 1>to put them together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those kinds of people learn the formal </v>

30
00:01:27.931 --> 00:01:28.764
<v Speaker 1>language quite easily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're typically tend to be quite </v>

31
00:01:30.901 --> 00:01:33.150
<v Speaker 1>introverted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm this type of person,</v>

32
00:01:33.151 --> 00:01:34.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm this type of learner.</v>

33
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.690
<v Speaker 1>I find it quite easy to learn the formal</v>
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>

34
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.553
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively easy to learn the formal </v>

35
00:01:38.731 --> 00:01:39.564
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find it easier to learn how to </v>

36
00:01:40.891 --> 00:01:41.724
<v Speaker 1>understand news broadcasts in a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>language than I do to understand casual </v>

37
00:01:45.451 --> 00:01:46.284
<v Speaker 1>conversations on the street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the type of learner I am </v>

38
00:01:48.481 --> 00:01:49.314
<v Speaker 1>naturally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just because of my personality and my </v>

39
00:01:51.181 --> 00:01:53.130
<v Speaker 1>learning style.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a visual learner.</v>

40
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm introverted and I'm quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>analytical.</v>

41
00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:57.870
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all very interesting.</v>

42
00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.150
<v Speaker 1>So let's hear from informal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ivan,</v>

43
00:02:00.151 --> 00:02:00.984
<v Speaker 1>can you tell us a little bit about </v>
<v Speaker 1>informal language and how that's </v>

44
00:02:03.001 --> 00:02:03.834
<v Speaker 1>different from the formal language that </v>
<v Speaker 1>frank described and the people who </v>

45
00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.940
<v Speaker 1>learned a formal language really easily.</v>
