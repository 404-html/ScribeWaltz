00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.320
<v Speaker 1>An English speaking Canadian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking about Hebrew in Japanese,</v>

2
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:10.610
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is up with that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How are you doing today guys?</v>

3
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.880
<v Speaker 1>This is a video that I've filmed for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>different channel,</v>

4
00:00:17.881 --> 00:00:19.440
<v Speaker 1>a Japanese channel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

5
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.530
<v Speaker 1>it's a video about the Hebrew language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's in Japanese.</v>

6
00:00:22.531 --> 00:00:23.364
<v Speaker 1>So it might seem strange to hear me </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about the Hebrew language in </v>

7
00:00:26.821 --> 00:00:30.630
<v Speaker 1>Japanese since I'm neither a native </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaker of Japanese or Hebrew,</v>

8
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.170
<v Speaker 1>but this was for a Japanese audience on </v>
<v Speaker 1>another channel.</v>

9
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.890
<v Speaker 1>But rather than recreate this whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>video in English,</v>

10
00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.660
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to just put subtitles on it so </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can check it.</v>
