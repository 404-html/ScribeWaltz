1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.190
<v Speaker 1>So it turns out I have to take a </v>
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>

2
00:00:02.191 --> 00:00:03.024
<v Speaker 1>credit and university,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to take the easiest </v>

3
00:00:05.191 --> 00:00:06.390
<v Speaker 1>language in the world.</v>

4
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:17.713
<v Speaker 1>Good day everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the most common questions about </v>

5
00:00:20.301 --> 00:00:23.330
<v Speaker 1>language learning is what is the easiest</v>
<v Speaker 1>language to learn?</v>

6
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:24.793
<v Speaker 1>Now there is no exact answer to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>question that applies to everyone </v>

7
00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:30.290
<v Speaker 1>because it depends on a few different </v>
<v Speaker 1>factors.</v>

8
00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.560
<v Speaker 1>So the factors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it depends on or your native language,</v>

9
00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:34.603
<v Speaker 1>any other languages you happened to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>learned and also the complexity of the </v>

10
00:00:38.691 --> 00:00:39.524
<v Speaker 1>language in question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if your native language is English </v>

11
00:00:42.861 --> 00:00:47.360
<v Speaker 1>than the easiest language for you is </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably the one that's the most similar</v>

12
00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:48.750
<v Speaker 1>to English.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

13
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:49.653
<v Speaker 1>and if it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then maybe you've learned another </v>

14
00:00:50.931 --> 00:00:53.420
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you've learned French,</v>

15
00:00:53.421 --> 00:00:54.254
<v Speaker 1>then maybe the language that's easiest </v>
<v Speaker 1>for you to learn as the one that's most </v>

16
00:00:57.051 --> 00:00:57.884
<v Speaker 1>similar to French because you've already</v>
<v Speaker 1>learned a lot of the concepts of those </v>

17
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.060
<v Speaker 1>that those languages have in common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've already done a lot of the work</v>

18
00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:06.140
<v Speaker 1>in the past already.</v>

19
00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.750
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it could be your native language,</v>

20
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.670
<v Speaker 1>the one that's closest to your native </v>
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>

21
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.350
<v Speaker 1>closest to other languages you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>learned,</v>

22
00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:17.060
<v Speaker 1>and it also another factor is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>complexity of that language.</v>

23
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.880
<v Speaker 1>So it could be a language that's similar</v>
<v Speaker 1>to your own,</v>

24
00:01:19.881 --> 00:01:22.880
<v Speaker 1>but if that language happens to be quite</v>
<v Speaker 1>complex,</v>

25
00:01:22.881 --> 00:01:23.714
<v Speaker 1>then maybe that's not the easiest one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's kind of a balance of those </v>

26
00:01:26.031 --> 00:01:28.010
<v Speaker 1>different factors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's.</v>

27
00:01:28.011 --> 00:01:28.844
<v Speaker 1>There's no precise formula,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we have an idea just from those </v>

28
00:01:32.751 --> 00:01:37.751
<v Speaker 1>factors now the American Foreign Service</v>
<v Speaker 1>Institute that trains American diplomats</v>

29
00:01:38.421 --> 00:01:39.254
<v Speaker 1>to go overseas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what trains them in language skills </v>

30
00:01:41.121 --> 00:01:45.560
<v Speaker 1>before their placement overseas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've done a lot of research into this</v>

31
00:01:45.561 --> 00:01:46.394
<v Speaker 1>topic as it relates to English speakers </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're training their American </v>

32
00:01:50.061 --> 00:01:52.370
<v Speaker 1>staff to go abroad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're English speakers,</v>

33
00:01:52.371 --> 00:01:53.204
<v Speaker 1>but they're learning other languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they have a lot of data about how </v>

34
00:01:55.731 --> 00:01:59.930
<v Speaker 1>many hours it takes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about how intensively they have to study</v>

35
00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.330
<v Speaker 1>these different groups of languages.</v>

36
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.940
<v Speaker 1>So they have it categorized into four </v>
<v Speaker 1>different groups.</v>

37
00:02:04.941 --> 00:02:07.640
<v Speaker 1>Is Category One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are the easiest languages to learn</v>

38
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.100
<v Speaker 1>for native English speakers than they've</v>
<v Speaker 1>got two,</v>

39
00:02:10.101 --> 00:02:10.641
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>

40
00:02:10.641 --> 00:02:14.840
<v Speaker 1>and then five is the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The group of most difficult languages to</v>

41
00:02:14.841 --> 00:02:18.890
<v Speaker 1>learn and those people studying those </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages study for I believe,</v>

42
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:19.753
<v Speaker 1>88 weeks full time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's like 88 weeks I guess a year </v>

43
00:02:23.661 --> 00:02:25.130
<v Speaker 1>and a half,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

44
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.233
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who study the category one </v>

45
00:02:27.651 --> 00:02:31.130
<v Speaker 1>languages I think are in there for 23 or</v>
<v Speaker 1>24 weeks full time.</v>

46
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.690
<v Speaker 1>So it's almost times four if you learn a</v>
<v Speaker 1>level five language.</v>

47
00:02:35.691 --> 00:02:39.290
<v Speaker 1>So which ones are in level one the </v>
<v Speaker 1>easiest category?</v>

48
00:02:39.291 --> 00:02:40.124
<v Speaker 1>They are uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Germanic languages such as a Dutch </v>

49
00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:45.583
<v Speaker 1>Africans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the northern Germanic languages from </v>

50
00:02:46.851 --> 00:02:48.410
<v Speaker 1>Scandinavia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sweden,</v>

51
00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.940
<v Speaker 1>a Swedish or Norwegian and Danish not </v>
<v Speaker 1>finished.</v>

52
00:02:52.941 --> 00:02:53.774
<v Speaker 1>That's separate language group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you've got the romance </v>

53
00:02:56.331 --> 00:02:57.164
<v Speaker 1>languages like French and Spanish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Italian and Portuguese and I believe </v>

54
00:03:00.911 --> 00:03:02.740
<v Speaker 1>also Romanian is in there.</v>

55
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.370
<v Speaker 1>So those ones are the most closely </v>
<v Speaker 1>related to English.</v>

56
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:07.773
<v Speaker 1>You've got the dramatic ones like Dutch </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Afrikaans and I think those are </v>

57
00:03:10.751 --> 00:03:14.680
<v Speaker 1>probably the most closely related to </v>
<v Speaker 1>English and the easiest to learn.</v>

58
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.020
<v Speaker 1>I haven't actually studied those </v>
<v Speaker 1>personally,</v>

59
00:03:17.021 --> 00:03:20.560
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of people say that Dutch is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the easiest for English speakers.</v>

60
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:21.783
<v Speaker 1>I have studied French and French has </v>
<v Speaker 1>been the easiest language that I have </v>

61
00:03:26.261 --> 00:03:29.770
<v Speaker 1>personally studied.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to think it was Indonesia because</v>

62
00:03:29.771 --> 00:03:30.604
<v Speaker 1>Indonesia is really simple and really </v>
<v Speaker 1>straightforward and I made really fast </v>

63
00:03:33.431 --> 00:03:34.264
<v Speaker 1>progress in it and I could communicate </v>
<v Speaker 1>an Indonesian after studying for just a </v>

64
00:03:37.781 --> 00:03:39.780
<v Speaker 1>couple of months before a trip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

65
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.953
<v Speaker 1>but when I started to study French I </v>
<v Speaker 1>realized how much of an advantage that </v>

66
00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:45.213
<v Speaker 1>shared vocabulary is because English </v>
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary is something like 35 percent </v>

67
00:03:49.541 --> 00:03:50.374
<v Speaker 1>French.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when I would look at a French text I </v>

68
00:03:52.091 --> 00:03:52.924
<v Speaker 1>would recognize a lot of the keywords </v>
<v Speaker 1>already and I can basically understand </v>

69
00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.020
<v Speaker 1>half of the text without ever having </v>
<v Speaker 1>studied French.</v>

70
00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.853
<v Speaker 1>So after a few weeks I could basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>read and after a few months I could </v>

71
00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:08.190
<v Speaker 1>communicate and speak not fluently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I could make myself understood and I</v>

72
00:04:08.381 --> 00:04:12.700
<v Speaker 1>could understand pretty much whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>was said to me face to face,</v>

73
00:04:12.701 --> 00:04:15.010
<v Speaker 1>at least not on the radio and not third </v>
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

74
00:04:15.011 --> 00:04:15.844
<v Speaker 1>but face to face I could understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So French has been definitely the </v>

75
00:04:18.821 --> 00:04:20.710
<v Speaker 1>easiest one for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Category too,</v>

76
00:04:20.711 --> 00:04:22.990
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>consists of only German.</v>

77
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.720
<v Speaker 1>German is a dramatic language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like that,</v>

78
00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:26.563
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Afrikaans and it's closely related to </v>

79
00:04:27.761 --> 00:04:28.594
<v Speaker 1>English,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also quite complex </v>

80
00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:32.283
<v Speaker 1>grammatically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that complicated from what I </v>

81
00:04:34.571 --> 00:04:37.360
<v Speaker 1>hear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it does have some complications like</v>

82
00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.110
<v Speaker 1>a grammatical case endings that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

83
00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.410
<v Speaker 1>other Germanic languages don't have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why it's not in category one.</v>

84
00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:45.483
<v Speaker 1>It's a little bit more complex than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>category one languages that puts it in </v>

85
00:04:48.701 --> 00:04:49.534
<v Speaker 1>category two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I believe it's the only language in </v>

86
00:04:51.761 --> 00:04:52.594
<v Speaker 1>category two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's kind of off on its own because </v>

87
00:04:55.151 --> 00:04:58.150
<v Speaker 1>it's related to English,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a little bit complicated.</v>

88
00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:03.160
<v Speaker 1>The hardest has been Japanese by far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

89
00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:04.203
<v Speaker 1>and that's one of the category five </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages according to the Foreign </v>

90
00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.110
<v Speaker 1>Service Institute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what makes Japanese so hard is first</v>

91
00:05:11.111 --> 00:05:11.944
<v Speaker 1>of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the grammatic grammar is very different </v>

92
00:05:13.451 --> 00:05:16.240
<v Speaker 1>from English.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about as different as you can get.</v>

93
00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:17.553
<v Speaker 1>And also the writing system is extremely</v>
<v Speaker 1>complex and I think that the Fsi </v>

94
00:05:22.661 --> 00:05:25.930
<v Speaker 1>categorization of level five doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>even take into account.</v>

95
00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.210
<v Speaker 1>The writing system is just the spoken </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

96
00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.810
<v Speaker 1>It matches my experience with French </v>
<v Speaker 1>versus Japanese.</v>

97
00:05:31.811 --> 00:05:32.644
<v Speaker 1>It's feel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it feels to me like it took about five </v>

98
00:05:34.451 --> 00:05:39.451
<v Speaker 1>times as long to get conversant in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Japanese as it did with French,</v>

99
00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:40.533
<v Speaker 1>about five times as long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then the writing system on top of </v>

100
00:05:42.821 --> 00:05:47.821
<v Speaker 1>that takes a lot longer than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe 10 times or 20 times or 30 times,</v>

101
00:05:48.311 --> 00:05:49.144
<v Speaker 1>as long as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as it takes to learn to read French to </v>

102
00:05:51.041 --> 00:05:54.100
<v Speaker 1>read and write French because it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're learning for different,</v>

103
00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:55.303
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>writing systems and combining them </v>

104
00:05:56.381 --> 00:05:56.830
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

105
00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:01.130
<v Speaker 1>You're idiographic pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the Chinese characters.</v>

106
00:06:01.131 --> 00:06:01.964
<v Speaker 1>Congee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are very complicated and there's </v>

107
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:06.410
<v Speaker 1>2000 of them that you need just to read </v>
<v Speaker 1>a book comfortably.</v>

108
00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:09.320
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're read in different ways.</v>

109
00:06:09.321 --> 00:06:10.940
<v Speaker 1>There's different pronunciations for </v>
<v Speaker 1>each one.</v>

110
00:06:10.941 --> 00:06:14.150
<v Speaker 1>So learning Japanese is a real longterm </v>
<v Speaker 1>intensive thing.</v>

111
00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.000
<v Speaker 1>So it's been the hardest for me a </v>
<v Speaker 1>second.</v>

112
00:06:17.001 --> 00:06:17.834
<v Speaker 1>So that will be Arabic because when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn Arabic you're learning not only </v>

113
00:06:21.081 --> 00:06:23.090
<v Speaker 1>one language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're learning the formal language,</v>

114
00:06:23.091 --> 00:06:27.020
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of outdated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>archaic language.</v>

115
00:06:27.021 --> 00:06:29.540
<v Speaker 1>But then you have to learn a dialect at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same time.</v>

116
00:06:29.541 --> 00:06:30.374
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to learn how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate with speakers of other </v>

117
00:06:32.631 --> 00:06:33.464
<v Speaker 1>dialects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So with Arabic you're learning a whole </v>

118
00:06:35.331 --> 00:06:37.820
<v Speaker 1>language family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what makes it hard.</v>

119
00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:39.193
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the easiest has definitely been </v>

120
00:06:40.101 --> 00:06:43.010
<v Speaker 1>French followed by Indonesian because of</v>
<v Speaker 1>its simplicity.</v>

121
00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:44.840
<v Speaker 1>A Indonesian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

122
00:06:44.841 --> 00:06:48.410
<v Speaker 1>is a category three language according </v>
<v Speaker 1>to Fsi.</v>

123
00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.380
<v Speaker 1>Obviously it's one of the more simple </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages,</v>

124
00:06:51.381 --> 00:06:56.381
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't have that shared </v>
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary that with English that French</v>

125
00:06:56.661 --> 00:07:00.710
<v Speaker 1>or Spanish or Italian or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or Dutch or Africans would have.</v>

126
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.040
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's not in category one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though it's very simple.</v>

127
00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:06.020
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope that was helpful.</v>

128
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:07.333
<v Speaker 1>I hope that gave you an understanding </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I hope you're not choosing the </v>

129
00:07:10.431 --> 00:07:12.860
<v Speaker 1>language to study just based on how easy</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

130
00:07:12.861 --> 00:07:15.740
<v Speaker 1>I hope you are just interested in </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting that information.</v>

131
00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:17.330
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have a good night.</v>

132
00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:18.223
<v Speaker 1>See you later.</v>
