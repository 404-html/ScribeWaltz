00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:01.143
<v Speaker 1>Back in 2013,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I produced one of the strangest videos </v>

2
00:00:04.151 --> 00:00:04.984
<v Speaker 1>on youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a video about Arabic in Japanese with </v>

3
00:00:07.421 --> 00:00:11.410
<v Speaker 1>English subtitles and me teaching in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Arabic lesson to Japanese viewers.</v>

4
00:00:11.411 --> 00:00:14.950
<v Speaker 1>At the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of people were bewildered today.</v>

5
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to try it again.</v>

6
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:22.310
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

7
00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:23.143
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and </v>

8
00:00:24.981 --> 00:00:25.814
<v Speaker 1>my name is Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today's topic is the Arabic language or </v>

9
00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:31.723
<v Speaker 1>as it's called in Arabic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arabic is the fifth most widely spoken </v>

10
00:00:34.971 --> 00:00:35.804
<v Speaker 1>language in the world with $293 million </v>
<v Speaker 1>native speakers in 422 million speakers </v>

11
00:00:41.001 --> 00:00:41.834
<v Speaker 1>in total.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an official language in 26 </v>

12
00:00:43.641 --> 00:00:44.474
<v Speaker 1>countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean it's the majority </v>

13
00:00:45.891 --> 00:00:49.160
<v Speaker 1>language in all of those countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's one of the official languages.</v>

14
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:50.203
<v Speaker 1>It is also one of the six official </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages of the United Nations and </v>

15
00:00:53.361 --> 00:00:56.150
<v Speaker 1>that's the language of the Quran,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the holy book of Islam.</v>

16
00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:57.043
<v Speaker 1>It is also the liturgical language of </v>
<v Speaker 1>one point 7 billion Muslims around the </v>

17
00:01:00.321 --> 00:01:02.630
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of those people don't speak Arabic,</v>

18
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.590
<v Speaker 1>but many have some knowledge of Arabic </v>
<v Speaker 1>for reading and for reciting prayers and</v>

19
00:01:06.591 --> 00:01:07.424
<v Speaker 1>religious study.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Speaking about Arabic can be confusing </v>

20
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.320
<v Speaker 1>because there are many different </v>
<v Speaker 1>varieties of the language.</v>

21
00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.200
<v Speaker 1>One of the main varieties is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>classical Arabic of the coo,</v>

22
00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:15.710
<v Speaker 1>Dan.</v>

23
00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.790
<v Speaker 1>This is considered by many to be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most perfect form of Arabic and some say</v>

24
00:01:19.791 --> 00:01:20.624
<v Speaker 1>it's the only true Arabic because it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>the language in which God revealed that </v>

25
00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.963
<v Speaker 1>to Mohammed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there's modern standard Arabic </v>

26
00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.170
<v Speaker 1>which is the form of Arabic used as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>official language today.</v>

27
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:31.243
<v Speaker 1>It's the modern form of literary Arabic </v>
<v Speaker 1>which was based on the classical Arabic </v>

28
00:01:34.371 --> 00:01:35.204
<v Speaker 1>of the coo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dan,</v>

29
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:36.043
<v Speaker 1>but with some adaptations and a greatly </v>
<v Speaker 1>expanded vocabulary to make it more </v>

30
00:01:39.111 --> 00:01:39.944
<v Speaker 1>suitable for modern times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not exactly the same as classical </v>

31
00:01:42.711 --> 00:01:43.544
<v Speaker 1>Arabic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but both of them are referred to by </v>

32
00:01:44.631 --> 00:01:45.464
<v Speaker 1>Arabs as hot meaning eloquent speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Modern Standard Arabic is the language </v>

33
00:01:49.941 --> 00:01:51.080
<v Speaker 1>of books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>media,</v>

34
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.340
<v Speaker 1>education and formal situations but not </v>
<v Speaker 1>as the language of everyday speech.</v>

35
00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.880
<v Speaker 1>For everyday speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arabic speakers use their local dialects</v>

36
00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:59.773
<v Speaker 1>or which can differ quite significantly </v>
<v Speaker 1>from country to country and even from </v>

37
00:02:04.311 --> 00:02:05.330
<v Speaker 1>one place to another.</v>

38
00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.240
<v Speaker 1>Within a single country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arabic is a Semitic language,</v>

39
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.760
<v Speaker 1>Arabic and other Semitic languages like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hebrew,</v>

40
00:02:10.761 --> 00:02:12.080
<v Speaker 1>Aramaic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Phoenician,</v>

41
00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.990
<v Speaker 1>all developed from the same protose </v>
<v Speaker 1>Semitic language,</v>

42
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.360
<v Speaker 1>Arabic forms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one branch of central submitting,</v>

43
00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.150
<v Speaker 1>while another branch of central Semitic </v>
<v Speaker 1>includes Hebrew,</v>

44
00:02:20.151 --> 00:02:21.320
<v Speaker 1>Aramaic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Phoenician,</v>

45
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.903
<v Speaker 1>old Arabic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>numerous Semitic languages related to </v>

46
00:02:25.191 --> 00:02:29.370
<v Speaker 1>Arabic were spoken in Arabia between the</v>
<v Speaker 1>13th at Tenth Century Ce,</v>

47
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.510
<v Speaker 1>but they don't have features that would </v>
<v Speaker 1>classify them as Arabic.</v>

48
00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.310
<v Speaker 1>The earliest evidence of people referred</v>
<v Speaker 1>to as Arab is in an Assyrian inscription</v>

49
00:02:37.311 --> 00:02:40.790
<v Speaker 1>from the eighth century bce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it just mentions the Arabs.</v>

50
00:02:40.791 --> 00:02:41.624
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't give any examples of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>language from the sixth century bce to </v>

51
00:02:44.901 --> 00:02:48.470
<v Speaker 1>the fourth century ce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have inscriptions showing evidence of</v>

52
00:02:48.471 --> 00:02:49.304
<v Speaker 1>an early form of Arabic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of those inscriptions are written </v>

53
00:02:51.501 --> 00:02:54.740
<v Speaker 1>in that early form of Arabic and others </v>
<v Speaker 1>are written in Aramaic,</v>

54
00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.570
<v Speaker 1>but show some influence from Arabic.</v>

55
00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.500
<v Speaker 1>Those inscriptions consists mostly of </v>
<v Speaker 1>proper names,</v>

56
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:00.363
<v Speaker 1>so they don't give us an awful lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>information about what the language was </v>

57
00:03:02.951 --> 00:03:03.784
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The earliest inscription that is </v>

58
00:03:05.081 --> 00:03:10.060
<v Speaker 1>unmistakably Arabic is from the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>century bce and was found at enough that</v>

59
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.900
<v Speaker 1>it's an Aramaic inscription,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it contains three lines of Arabic.</v>

60
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.033
<v Speaker 1>Another inscription was discovered at </v>
<v Speaker 1>end the Mazda 120 kilometers southeast </v>

61
00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:22.080
<v Speaker 1>of Damascus dating back to three slash </v>
<v Speaker 1>29 slash ce.</v>

62
00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:23.343
<v Speaker 1>The language of this inscription is </v>
<v Speaker 1>nearly identical to classical Arabic as </v>

63
00:03:26.321 --> 00:03:27.154
<v Speaker 1>we know it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though these inscriptions are </v>

64
00:03:28.421 --> 00:03:29.254
<v Speaker 1>unmistakably written in Arabic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are not written in the Arabic </v>

65
00:03:31.721 --> 00:03:32.554
<v Speaker 1>script,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but rather the Nabataeans script which </v>

66
00:03:34.421 --> 00:03:38.590
<v Speaker 1>derived from the Aramaic script,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are also inscriptions from the</v>

67
00:03:38.591 --> 00:03:39.424
<v Speaker 1>fourth and fifth century Ce that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>written in a script that's more like </v>

68
00:03:42.311 --> 00:03:43.144
<v Speaker 1>Arabic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's generally thought that the Arabic </v>

69
00:03:44.741 --> 00:03:45.574
<v Speaker 1>script developed from the Nabataeans </v>
<v Speaker 1>script and these inscriptions might be </v>

70
00:03:48.311 --> 00:03:52.450
<v Speaker 1>written in a script that somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 1>between those two classical Arabic,</v>

71
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:53.673
<v Speaker 1>before the beginning of Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were numerous dialects of Arabic </v>

72
00:03:56.291 --> 00:03:57.124
<v Speaker 1>spoken around the peninsula,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was also a common literary </v>

73
00:03:59.501 --> 00:04:02.170
<v Speaker 1>language used among the different tribes</v>
<v Speaker 1>for poetry,</v>

74
00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.740
<v Speaker 1>a coin it which was a compromise between</v>
<v Speaker 1>the various dialects.</v>

75
00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:06.813
<v Speaker 1>The pieces of poetry written in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>literary coin a are the earliest </v>

76
00:04:09.641 --> 00:04:10.474
<v Speaker 1>examples of classical Arabic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Koran was written in the seventh </v>

77
00:04:13.001 --> 00:04:13.834
<v Speaker 1>century when Muslims believe that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Qur'an was revealed to Muhammad by the </v>

78
00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:18.783
<v Speaker 1>Angel Gabriel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it was written down over a 23 </v>

79
00:04:20.381 --> 00:04:22.780
<v Speaker 1>year period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the time the Koran was written,</v>

80
00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.210
<v Speaker 1>there were seven dialects of classical </v>
<v Speaker 1>Arabic.</v>

81
00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.333
<v Speaker 1>The Koran was written in all of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the ice version became the standard </v>

82
00:04:29.651 --> 00:04:32.350
<v Speaker 1>upon which the text of today's call is </v>
<v Speaker 1>based.</v>

83
00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.010
<v Speaker 1>The differences are in pronunciation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not in vocabulary or grammar.</v>

84
00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:36.993
<v Speaker 1>The Arabic of the [inaudible] is similar</v>
<v Speaker 1>to that of the pre-islamic classical </v>

85
00:04:40.091 --> 00:04:40.924
<v Speaker 1>Arabic poetry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not exactly beginning during the </v>

86
00:04:43.151 --> 00:04:46.120
<v Speaker 1>life of Mohammed and continuing into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>18th century,</v>

87
00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.230
<v Speaker 1>the Islamic conquest spread the Arabic </v>
<v Speaker 1>language into new faraway lands.</v>

88
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:51.333
<v Speaker 1>After the Islamic conquest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was an important need to </v>

89
00:04:53.381 --> 00:04:54.214
<v Speaker 1>standardize the language because of vast</v>
<v Speaker 1>numbers of people were beginning to </v>

90
00:04:56.891 --> 00:04:57.550
<v Speaker 1>speak it.</v>

91
00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.260
<v Speaker 1>The script was made,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more practical.</v>

92
00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.153
<v Speaker 1>New Vocabulary was created and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>grammar and style of pro is West </v>

93
00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.390
<v Speaker 1>standardized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Neo,</v>

94
00:05:04.391 --> 00:05:05.224
<v Speaker 1>Arabic and middle Arabic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Classical Arabic was being standardized </v>

95
00:05:08.261 --> 00:05:11.890
<v Speaker 1>as a written language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Local dialects of Arabic also emerged in</v>

96
00:05:11.891 --> 00:05:12.724
<v Speaker 1>the cities of the Arab empire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These dialects did not descend directly </v>

97
00:05:15.611 --> 00:05:16.444
<v Speaker 1>from classical Arabic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but rather from pre-islamic Arabic </v>

98
00:05:18.821 --> 00:05:19.654
<v Speaker 1>dialects or from a single Arabic coin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was the common language of </v>

99
00:05:23.291 --> 00:05:24.124
<v Speaker 1>conquering Arab armies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These new dialects were also influenced </v>

100
00:05:26.891 --> 00:05:29.560
<v Speaker 1>by the original languages of areas that </v>
<v Speaker 1>were conquered.</v>

101
00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.490
<v Speaker 1>The dialects of the lavant and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mesopotamia were influenced by Aramaic.</v>

102
00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.430
<v Speaker 1>The dialects of the Maghreb were </v>
<v Speaker 1>influenced by Berber.</v>

103
00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.790
<v Speaker 1>The dialects of Egypt were influenced by</v>
<v Speaker 1>Coptic and so on.</v>

104
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.200
<v Speaker 1>The early centuries of these newly </v>
<v Speaker 1>emerging dialects are referred to as neo</v>

105
00:05:44.201 --> 00:05:45.034
<v Speaker 1>Arabic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though classical Arabic was </v>

106
00:05:46.481 --> 00:05:49.120
<v Speaker 1>standardized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not everybody could write it perfectly.</v>

107
00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:50.223
<v Speaker 1>Writing that contains features of both </v>
<v Speaker 1>classical Arabic and neo Arabic or </v>

108
00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:58.370
<v Speaker 1>dialects is referred to as middle Arabic</v>
<v Speaker 1>middle refer to a time period,</v>

109
00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.233
<v Speaker 1>but rather these texts were somewhere in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the middle between classical and </v>

110
00:06:01.641 --> 00:06:03.410
<v Speaker 1>colloquial modern Arabic.</v>

111
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:04.423
<v Speaker 1>Over the centuries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the neo Arabic dialects continued to </v>

112
00:06:06.801 --> 00:06:09.500
<v Speaker 1>evolve into the modern colloquial </v>
<v Speaker 1>dialects of today,</v>

113
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:14.260
<v Speaker 1>but literary Arabic remains relatively </v>
<v Speaker 1>constant because the Arabic of the Koran</v>

114
00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:15.223
<v Speaker 1>was always seen as the ideal Arabic to </v>
<v Speaker 1>imitate and this probably had a </v>

115
00:06:18.531 --> 00:06:22.430
<v Speaker 1>conservative effect on the dialects </v>
<v Speaker 1>limiting them from changing too much.</v>

116
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:23.383
<v Speaker 1>After Napoleon entered Egypt in 1798,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Arab world entered a period of </v>

117
00:06:27.291 --> 00:06:28.124
<v Speaker 1>greater contact with the West.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The influx of new western concepts </v>

118
00:06:31.131 --> 00:06:35.060
<v Speaker 1>required the Arabic language to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>updated in the early 20th century,</v>

119
00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:35.953
<v Speaker 1>regional academies of the Arabic </v>
<v Speaker 1>language began a process of language </v>

120
00:06:38.901 --> 00:06:43.220
<v Speaker 1>reform focused mainly on expanding and </v>
<v Speaker 1>updating the languages vocabulary.</v>

121
00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:44.203
<v Speaker 1>These updates culminated in what is now </v>
<v Speaker 1>known as modern standard Arabic die </v>

122
00:06:47.691 --> 00:06:48.524
<v Speaker 1>glossier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arabic is well known for its state of </v>

123
00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:51.403
<v Speaker 1>glossier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arabic speakers used two distinctly </v>

124
00:06:53.451 --> 00:06:56.930
<v Speaker 1>different forms of the language in </v>
<v Speaker 1>parallel for different purposes.</v>

125
00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:00.680
<v Speaker 1>Modern standard Arabic is not learned by</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone as a native language,</v>

126
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:01.663
<v Speaker 1>but it's used in reading and writing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>media on children's TV shows ended </v>

127
00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:05.923
<v Speaker 1>formal speeches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while the colloquial dialects are used </v>

128
00:07:08.061 --> 00:07:10.220
<v Speaker 1>almost universally for daily </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>

129
00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:13.430
<v Speaker 1>As I mentioned before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's quite a lot of variation amongst</v>

130
00:07:13.431 --> 00:07:14.264
<v Speaker 1>Arabic dialects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How well two speakers understand each </v>

131
00:07:16.521 --> 00:07:17.354
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depends on the geographic distance of </v>

132
00:07:18.711 --> 00:07:19.544
<v Speaker 1>their dialects as well as exposure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many Arabic speakers have told me that </v>

133
00:07:22.671 --> 00:07:23.504
<v Speaker 1>speakers up the Middle Eastern dialects </v>
<v Speaker 1>really have no trouble understanding </v>

134
00:07:26.301 --> 00:07:27.134
<v Speaker 1>each other and that the main trouble </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes in understanding the my grubby </v>

135
00:07:29.601 --> 00:07:31.340
<v Speaker 1>dialects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially Moroccan,</v>

136
00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:34.490
<v Speaker 1>but these days with the spread of cable </v>
<v Speaker 1>TV and the Internet,</v>

137
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:35.383
<v Speaker 1>people are being exposed to a wider </v>
<v Speaker 1>range of dialects on a more regular </v>

138
00:07:38.181 --> 00:07:39.014
<v Speaker 1>basis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which helps people understand different </v>

139
00:07:40.221 --> 00:07:44.690
<v Speaker 1>dialects more and of course there's also</v>
<v Speaker 1>our facade modern standard Arabic.</v>

140
00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:48.260
<v Speaker 1>When speakers have significantly </v>
<v Speaker 1>different dialects communicate with each</v>

141
00:07:48.261 --> 00:07:49.094
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can switch the modern standard </v>

142
00:07:50.151 --> 00:07:50.984
<v Speaker 1>Arabic or they can adjust their speech </v>
<v Speaker 1>to make it more formal and literary and </v>

143
00:07:54.231 --> 00:07:55.064
<v Speaker 1>similar to modern standard Arabic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not exactly another common way for </v>

144
00:07:58.131 --> 00:08:02.030
<v Speaker 1>native speakers to bridge the dialect </v>
<v Speaker 1>gap is to use something called the white</v>

145
00:08:02.031 --> 00:08:02.864
<v Speaker 1>dialect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a more formal version of </v>

146
00:08:04.191 --> 00:08:05.024
<v Speaker 1>dialectal speech that uses features that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are common to most of the different </v>

147
00:08:08.301 --> 00:08:09.134
<v Speaker 1>dialects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it leaves out features that are </v>

148
00:08:10.341 --> 00:08:12.020
<v Speaker 1>limited to specific dialects.</v>

149
00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:14.680
<v Speaker 1>This is essentially a modern Arabic coin</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

150
00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:15.703
<v Speaker 1>so what's Arabic like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's take a look at some features of </v>

151
00:08:18.411 --> 00:08:20.840
<v Speaker 1>Arabic focusing on modern standard </v>
<v Speaker 1>Arabic.</v>

152
00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:21.913
<v Speaker 1>The script,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Arabic script is written from right </v>

153
00:08:23.901 --> 00:08:27.050
<v Speaker 1>to left and consists of letters that </v>
<v Speaker 1>imitate handwriting.</v>

154
00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:29.900
<v Speaker 1>Most letters joined to the letter that </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes after them.</v>

155
00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.090
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a few letters remain disjoined.</v>

156
00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:33.853
<v Speaker 1>The letters that joined have two forms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one short form at the beginning or in </v>

157
00:08:37.071 --> 00:08:40.280
<v Speaker 1>the middle of words and another long </v>
<v Speaker 1>form at the end of words,</v>

158
00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:44.960
<v Speaker 1>or when the letter is by itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Arabic script is an abject,</v>

159
00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:45.913
<v Speaker 1>meaning that each letter represents a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consonant and that short vowels are not </v>

160
00:08:48.591 --> 00:08:52.370
<v Speaker 1>really written in that long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vowels and diphthongs can be ambiguous.</v>

161
00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:55.100
<v Speaker 1>How can we read Arabic without vowels?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

162
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:55.973
<v Speaker 1>can you read this here at the short,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vowels are not written and the other </v>

163
00:08:59.171 --> 00:09:02.640
<v Speaker 1>seems somewhat incomplete,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we have a hint about what the vowels</v>

164
00:09:02.641 --> 00:09:03.330
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

165
00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:04.163
<v Speaker 1>This is kind of like reading Arabic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Arabic has more predictable vowel </v>

166
00:09:06.991 --> 00:09:09.210
<v Speaker 1>patterns than English,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's easier to guess.</v>

167
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:10.433
<v Speaker 1>Also Arabic can be written with how cat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are extra diacritic markings that </v>

168
00:09:14.431 --> 00:09:15.264
<v Speaker 1>indicate the short vowel sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are generally only used in texts </v>

169
00:09:18.301 --> 00:09:22.020
<v Speaker 1>that are really important to pronounce </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfectly like the [inaudible] or poetry</v>

170
00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:24.900
<v Speaker 1>or children's materials.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Phonology.</v>

171
00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:26.213
<v Speaker 1>Arabic has a number of consonant sounds </v>
<v Speaker 1>which are surprising or challenging for </v>

172
00:09:29.221 --> 00:09:31.650
<v Speaker 1>speakers of many other languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

173
00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:37.670
<v Speaker 1>as in the word meaning Gulf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there's off as in the word pin.</v>

174
00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:42.360
<v Speaker 1>This is like the k but pronounced </v>
<v Speaker 1>further back in your throat.</v>

175
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:48.350
<v Speaker 1>Then there's the letter ha,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in the word meaning hot in some say</v>

176
00:09:49.231 --> 00:09:51.750
<v Speaker 1>that this is similar to the French are </v>
<v Speaker 1>sound.</v>

177
00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:52.673
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the word meaning room Arabic also has a </v>

178
00:09:56.491 --> 00:09:59.280
<v Speaker 1>number of infected consonants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

179
00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:02.460
<v Speaker 1>there's a scene which is like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>regular s sound in English,</v>

180
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:06.660
<v Speaker 1>but there is also sod,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is an emphatic s as in the word,</v>

181
00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:08.550
<v Speaker 1>meaning small.</v>

182
00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:11.850
<v Speaker 1>Also notice design in the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To make this sound,</v>

183
00:10:11.851 --> 00:10:14.400
<v Speaker 1>do you have to keep your tongue close to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the roof of your mouth.</v>

184
00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:15.293
<v Speaker 1>If you want to try it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>position your mouth as though you are </v>

185
00:10:17.071 --> 00:10:19.590
<v Speaker 1>going to say a pe and hold that </v>
<v Speaker 1>position.</v>

186
00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:21.360
<v Speaker 1>Then make an s sound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

187
00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:22.403
<v Speaker 1>go ahead and try it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saw saw there are three other emphatic </v>

188
00:10:26.281 --> 00:10:31.281
<v Speaker 1>consonants to an emphatic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tall dog and zoll morphology.</v>

189
00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:36.630
<v Speaker 1>Arabic words are mostly constructed from</v>
<v Speaker 1>three letter routes or sometimes four,</v>

190
00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:37.763
<v Speaker 1>and these letters are then inserted into</v>
<v Speaker 1>templates consisting of a fixed vowel </v>

191
00:10:41.071 --> 00:10:44.790
<v Speaker 1>pattern and some structural consonance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you know the route letters,</v>

192
00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:48.690
<v Speaker 1>you can identify the core meaning of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>word and if you know the template,</v>

193
00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:53.430
<v Speaker 1>you know what type of word it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's take the root ca at a gym,</v>

194
00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:57.480
<v Speaker 1>which means to go out or to exit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and let's put it into this template.</v>

195
00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:00.200
<v Speaker 1>We get the word mythology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the noun,</v>

196
00:11:00.201 --> 00:11:02.040
<v Speaker 1>meaning exit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like adore you,</v>

197
00:11:02.041 --> 00:11:02.874
<v Speaker 1>exit through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This template indicates a place where </v>

198
00:11:05.431 --> 00:11:08.610
<v Speaker 1>the action of the root is done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we use the root data,</v>

199
00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:11.490
<v Speaker 1>Ha Lem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means to come in,</v>

200
00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:12.810
<v Speaker 1>we get mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The honey,</v>

201
00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:14.003
<v Speaker 1>which means entrance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we use the root cath to bet we get </v>

202
00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:20.363
<v Speaker 1>the meaning office.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These kinds of recurring templates help </v>

203
00:11:23.191 --> 00:11:26.670
<v Speaker 1>you to know how to pronounce words even </v>
<v Speaker 1>when the short vowels are not written.</v>

204
00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:27.743
<v Speaker 1>If you see the letter meme followed by </v>
<v Speaker 1>three route letters altogether with no </v>

205
00:11:30.901 --> 00:11:31.734
<v Speaker 1>long vowels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can guess that the word is in this </v>

206
00:11:33.271 --> 00:11:36.000
<v Speaker 1>template and pronounce it with too short</v>
<v Speaker 1>a vowels.</v>

207
00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:40.410
<v Speaker 1>Verbs in Arabic are part of this same </v>
<v Speaker 1>system of roots and templates.</v>

208
00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:44.310
<v Speaker 1>The templates tell us the tense person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gender and number of the verb,</v>

209
00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:46.620
<v Speaker 1>and the root provides us the core </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning.</v>

210
00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:47.693
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's take the route at a gym and pump </v>

211
00:11:50.851 --> 00:11:55.510
<v Speaker 1>it into this template here and we get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we know what this means.</v>

212
00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:57.610
<v Speaker 1>It's the past tense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Third Person,</v>

213
00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:59.350
<v Speaker 1>masculine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>singular conjugation.</v>

214
00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:00.490
<v Speaker 1>He exited.</v>

215
00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:07.780
<v Speaker 1>This means he exited the school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now put the route into this template.</v>

216
00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:10.600
<v Speaker 1>What this means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I exited.</v>

217
00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:14.400
<v Speaker 1>This suffix here indicates past tense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first person singular out,</v>

218
00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:17.800
<v Speaker 1>assuming that this means I exited the </v>
<v Speaker 1>office.</v>

219
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:21.080
<v Speaker 1>If we put it into this template,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

220
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.330
<v Speaker 1>it means he exits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the present tense template.</v>

221
00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:32.590
<v Speaker 1>This means he exits the office.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they exit.</v>

222
00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:36.363
<v Speaker 1>This means they will exit the office.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The sentences in the future tense to </v>

223
00:12:39.671 --> 00:12:41.770
<v Speaker 1>change the present tense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the future tense.</v>

224
00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:46.000
<v Speaker 1>You simply add the suffix psa to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning of the present tense template.</v>

225
00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:51.210
<v Speaker 1>Sap is used for near future and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>separate particle so far is used for the</v>

226
00:12:51.431 --> 00:12:54.520
<v Speaker 1>more distant future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arabic has no other verb tenses,</v>

227
00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:58.540
<v Speaker 1>only past and present and future which </v>
<v Speaker 1>uses the present tense conjugation.</v>

228
00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:02.380
<v Speaker 1>This submittal system of roots and </v>
<v Speaker 1>templates is really quite intuitive once</v>

229
00:13:02.381 --> 00:13:03.214
<v Speaker 1>you get used to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's quite ingenious if you ask me </v>

230
00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:06.130
<v Speaker 1>word order.</v>

231
00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:06.963
<v Speaker 1>Modern standard Arabic is a vsl language</v>
<v Speaker 1>by default as opposed to Arabic </v>

232
00:13:10.931 --> 00:13:13.120
<v Speaker 1>dialects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are mainly Svo.</v>

233
00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:18.220
<v Speaker 1>You had this means the man is studying </v>
<v Speaker 1>Arabic.</v>

234
00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:21.220
<v Speaker 1>Here's the verb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the subject and the object.</v>

235
00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:25.480
<v Speaker 1>These are the definite article,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but before certain letters,</v>

236
00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:29.230
<v Speaker 1>the lamb or the l sound assimilates to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the following letter,</v>

237
00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:33.580
<v Speaker 1>so I'll Rajul becomes our agile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the basic word order,</v>

238
00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:37.450
<v Speaker 1>but Svo is also possible in a sentence </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a pronoun.</v>

239
00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:39.940
<v Speaker 1>VSL is not possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

240
00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:41.790
<v Speaker 1>and a sofa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of.</v>

241
00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:42.633
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this means I will study Arabic in the </v>

242
00:13:44.711 --> 00:13:48.370
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't say Sofa and a lot of Va.</v>

243
00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:52.450
<v Speaker 1>You can either say it with the pronoun </v>
<v Speaker 1>first or with no pronouns,</v>

244
00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:53.343
<v Speaker 1>just sofa because the verb conjugation </v>
<v Speaker 1>tells us that this is the first person </v>

245
00:13:57.881 --> 00:14:00.850
<v Speaker 1>singular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we don't need the pronoun cases.</v>

246
00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:05.290
<v Speaker 1>One aspect of standard arabic is cases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are three cases in arabic.</v>

247
00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:06.183
<v Speaker 1>Nominative genitive and accusative </v>
<v Speaker 1>announced takes special endings to show </v>

248
00:14:09.941 --> 00:14:12.760
<v Speaker 1>their function in the sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's take the word keY tab,</v>

249
00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:16.930
<v Speaker 1>which means book in nominative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's taboo in genitive.</v>

250
00:14:16.931 --> 00:14:20.140
<v Speaker 1>It's keith rabie in accusative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's tabba.</v>

251
00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:23.703
<v Speaker 1>This means the excellent book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The noun key tab is in the nominative </v>

252
00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:31.260
<v Speaker 1>and the adjective is also inflicted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>agree with the noun and then upload will</v>

253
00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:34.690
<v Speaker 1>keep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means I am reading a book here.</v>

254
00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:37.630
<v Speaker 1>Github is in the accusative and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>indefinite.</v>

255
00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:42.330
<v Speaker 1>The end sound at the end here indicates </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's indefinite will.</v>

256
00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:46.150
<v Speaker 1>This means so the author of the book </v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

257
00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:47.013
<v Speaker 1>key tab is in the genitive case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These cases and things are not used at </v>

258
00:14:49.901 --> 00:14:50.734
<v Speaker 1>the end of a sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but only when the word is followed by </v>

259
00:14:52.701 --> 00:14:53.534
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>the form at the end of a sentence </v>

260
00:14:54.891 --> 00:14:57.460
<v Speaker 1>without a case ending is called the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Puzzle form.</v>

261
00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:01.520
<v Speaker 1>These case endings are often not used in</v>
<v Speaker 1>modern standard arabic.</v>

262
00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:04.400
<v Speaker 1>They're generally only used in prepared </v>
<v Speaker 1>texts are prepared.</v>

263
00:15:04.401 --> 00:15:06.410
<v Speaker 1>Speeches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two more sentences.</v>

264
00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:13.190
<v Speaker 1>This means I usually don't work on </v>
<v Speaker 1>saturday word for word.</v>

265
00:15:13.191 --> 00:15:16.550
<v Speaker 1>it's usually no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I work day.</v>

266
00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:17.473
<v Speaker 1>The saturday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the negation particle used for </v>

267
00:15:20.571 --> 00:15:21.404
<v Speaker 1>the present tense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amen is the verb for work and its root </v>

268
00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:25.273
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm meme lem and this is the first </v>

269
00:15:27.891 --> 00:15:30.320
<v Speaker 1>person singular present tense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conjugation,</v>

270
00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:31.423
<v Speaker 1>yelm and accept around [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>So together they mean the day of </v>

271
00:15:34.851 --> 00:15:35.684
<v Speaker 1>saturday you'd offer is a construction </v>
<v Speaker 1>of two nouns side by side to show </v>

272
00:15:39.351 --> 00:15:40.850
<v Speaker 1>possession.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fun fact.</v>

273
00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:43.790
<v Speaker 1>The word sabbath comes from the hebrew </v>
<v Speaker 1>word shabbat,</v>

274
00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:46.180
<v Speaker 1>which is related to this arabic word </v>
<v Speaker 1>sept.</v>

275
00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:48.283
<v Speaker 1>Who would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this means I'll drive my car to the </v>

276
00:15:51.921 --> 00:15:56.921
<v Speaker 1>office word for word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's will I drive my car to the office.</v>

277
00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:58.153
<v Speaker 1>Remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>saw is added to the present tense verb </v>

278
00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:04.700
<v Speaker 1>to form the future of food contains the </v>
<v Speaker 1>verb cough while dad,</v>

279
00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:07.340
<v Speaker 1>and this is the first person singular </v>
<v Speaker 1>present tense,</v>

280
00:16:07.341 --> 00:16:08.510
<v Speaker 1>conjugation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sayada.</v>

281
00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:11.900
<v Speaker 1>It is the word sayada with a possessive </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffix,</v>

282
00:16:11.901 --> 00:16:14.810
<v Speaker 1>meaning my at the end and when a suffix </v>
<v Speaker 1>is added,</v>

283
00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:19.930
<v Speaker 1>the letter had becomes a tad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isla is a preposition showing direction.</v>

284
00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:23.720
<v Speaker 1>The elbow here or the lamb is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>definite article al,</v>

285
00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:27.260
<v Speaker 1>but the a sound or the eleaf assimilates</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the proceeding.</v>

286
00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:29.270
<v Speaker 1>Long a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you can see,</v>

287
00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:30.133
<v Speaker 1>arabic is a fascinating language with </v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of interesting features from its </v>

288
00:16:33.041 --> 00:16:36.410
<v Speaker 1>script to it's phonology to its root and</v>
<v Speaker 1>template system.</v>

289
00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:39.500
<v Speaker 1>It's a language that often seems </v>
<v Speaker 1>intimidating to learners,</v>

290
00:16:39.501 --> 00:16:40.334
<v Speaker 1>but that's partly because modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>standard arabic materials are aimed at </v>

291
00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:44.113
<v Speaker 1>reading and writing and grammar rather </v>
<v Speaker 1>than on communication materials for </v>

292
00:16:47.181 --> 00:16:50.360
<v Speaker 1>learning arabic dialects tend to be more</v>
<v Speaker 1>fun and communicative.</v>

293
00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:54.500
<v Speaker 1>The question that's asked over and over </v>
<v Speaker 1>and over is what form of arabic should I</v>

294
00:16:54.501 --> 00:16:56.990
<v Speaker 1>learn a dialect or a modern standard </v>
<v Speaker 1>arabic,</v>

295
00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:58.093
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's important to learn some modern </v>

296
00:16:59.481 --> 00:17:03.470
<v Speaker 1>standard arabic either before you start </v>
<v Speaker 1>to learn a dialect or at the same time,</v>

297
00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:05.780
<v Speaker 1>but if you know some modern standard </v>
<v Speaker 1>arabic,</v>

298
00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:06.733
<v Speaker 1>it will help you to make sense of </v>
<v Speaker 1>different dialects that you encounter </v>

299
00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:10.093
<v Speaker 1>and it will help you to understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>different registers of speech even when </v>

300
00:17:12.801 --> 00:17:13.634
<v Speaker 1>people are speaking in their dialects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if your main goal is communication </v>

301
00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:20.240
<v Speaker 1>than I don't think it's necessary to </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn to speak modern standard arabic at</v>

302
00:17:20.241 --> 00:17:21.074
<v Speaker 1>a high level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that brings me to the question of </v>

303
00:17:24.231 --> 00:17:28.010
<v Speaker 1>the day to native speakers of arabic and</v>
<v Speaker 1>to learners of arabic alike.</v>

304
00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:28.873
<v Speaker 1>What do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which form of arabic is the best to </v>

305
00:17:30.861 --> 00:17:33.410
<v Speaker 1>learn?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Modern standard arabic or a dialect?</v>

306
00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:35.750
<v Speaker 1>Leave your answers in the comments down </v>

309
00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:40.243
<v Speaker 1>It's especially important these days </v>
<v Speaker 1>because weird things are happening with </v>

310
00:17:42.921 --> 00:17:45.710

311
