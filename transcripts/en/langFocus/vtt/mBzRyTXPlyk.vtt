00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:01.403
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you seen the new Leonardo Dicaprio </v>

2
00:00:02.581 --> 00:00:03.780
<v Speaker 1>movie?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

3
00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.040
<v Speaker 1>that guy is such a good actor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's so lucky.</v>

4
00:00:06.041 --> 00:00:08.420
<v Speaker 1>He's so lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has that talent is rich.</v>

5
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:09.900
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't even have to do any hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

6
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:18.513
<v Speaker 1>Good afternoon everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today I'm going to talk about whether </v>

7
00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:21.213
<v Speaker 1>some people are naturally just good with</v>
<v Speaker 1>languages and other people are not good </v>

8
00:00:25.061 --> 00:00:25.894
<v Speaker 1>with languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usually when people hear about how I </v>

9
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.170
<v Speaker 1>speak several different languages and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>love studying languages,</v>

10
00:00:32.171 --> 00:00:33.670
<v Speaker 1>they often say to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

11
00:00:33.671 --> 00:00:35.310
<v Speaker 1>you're so lucky you can speak those </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>

12
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.040
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of makes me laugh usually,</v>

13
00:00:39.041 --> 00:00:42.160
<v Speaker 1>but it's also kind of annoying because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not lucky.</v>

14
00:00:42.161 --> 00:00:44.680
<v Speaker 1>I worked really hard to learn all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those languages,</v>

15
00:00:44.681 --> 00:00:45.514
<v Speaker 1>but people don't really see that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they just see the final </v>

16
00:00:47.771 --> 00:00:48.604
<v Speaker 1>result,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that I can speak these </v>

17
00:00:49.631 --> 00:00:52.390
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't see all of the effort and the</v>

18
00:00:52.391 --> 00:00:55.420
<v Speaker 1>process that went into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just see that final,</v>

19
00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the final result and they think,</v>

20
00:00:58.061 --> 00:00:59.110
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't do that.</v>

21
00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.770
<v Speaker 1>So they think that it's somehow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just a natural talent that I have.</v>

22
00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.020
<v Speaker 1>But actually I'm not talented with </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>

23
00:01:05.021 --> 00:01:05.854
<v Speaker 1>I just love studying languages and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why I can easily put in the time </v>

24
00:01:09.401 --> 00:01:13.570
<v Speaker 1>and I can kind of slug through all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the grind to get good at a language.</v>

25
00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.180
<v Speaker 1>People who say I'm not good with </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages,</v>

26
00:01:16.181 --> 00:01:19.330
<v Speaker 1>they usually have no idea what goes into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the process.</v>

27
00:01:19.331 --> 00:01:20.164
<v Speaker 1>They don't realize that it takes </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds and hundreds of hours to get </v>

28
00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:23.643
<v Speaker 1>pretty good with the language and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>takes thousands of hours to get really </v>

29
00:01:26.741 --> 00:01:27.574
<v Speaker 1>good at a language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably they hear about people getting </v>

30
00:01:30.101 --> 00:01:33.070
<v Speaker 1>good at a language in three months or in</v>
<v Speaker 1>six months and they think,</v>

31
00:01:33.071 --> 00:01:35.290
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really a short period of time.</v>

32
00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.710
<v Speaker 1>It sounds easy and they buy in to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>marketing and all that kind of thing.</v>

33
00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.873
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't realize that within that </v>

34
00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.903
<v Speaker 1>short amount of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who get good at a language or </v>

35
00:01:44.981 --> 00:01:45.814
<v Speaker 1>probably just completely focused and </v>
<v Speaker 1>dedicated and obsessed with that </v>

36
00:01:49.091 --> 00:01:49.450
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

37
00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.030
<v Speaker 1>Like if you get good at a language in </v>
<v Speaker 1>six months and you're fluent,</v>

38
00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.893
<v Speaker 1>that means you busted your ass that </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole six months and that language </v>

39
00:01:55.571 --> 00:01:57.480
<v Speaker 1>became your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

40
00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.980
<v Speaker 1>learning a language is like climbing a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mountain,</v>

41
00:01:59.981 --> 00:02:00.980
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

42
00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.330
<v Speaker 1>it's a struggle and it's a challenge </v>
<v Speaker 1>every step of the way.</v>

43
00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:05.403
<v Speaker 1>But that's why it's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So some people endure that grind and </v>

44
00:02:09.041 --> 00:02:09.874
<v Speaker 1>endured the challenge because they love </v>
<v Speaker 1>it or because they're really motivated </v>

45
00:02:12.251 --> 00:02:13.084
<v Speaker 1>by that goal of reaching the top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's the same as people who climb </v>

46
00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.560
<v Speaker 1>real mountains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why did they climb it?</v>

47
00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:18.423
<v Speaker 1>Not because it's easy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the climate because they love the </v>

48
00:02:21.311 --> 00:02:25.300
<v Speaker 1>challenge or they really enjoy getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the top of the mountain,</v>

49
00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.790
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not that it's easy,</v>

50
00:02:27.791 --> 00:02:28.624
<v Speaker 1>it's that some people just love the </v>
<v Speaker 1>challenge and that's why they can stick </v>

51
00:02:31.181 --> 00:02:32.620
<v Speaker 1>it out and they can grind through it.</v>

52
00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.890
<v Speaker 1>And that's why they can put in the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the effort to get really good at it.</v>

53
00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.020
<v Speaker 1>So some people are not good at languages</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they have bad habits,</v>

54
00:02:41.021 --> 00:02:41.854
<v Speaker 1>bad study habits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or just bad habits of hard work in </v>

55
00:02:44.441 --> 00:02:45.274
<v Speaker 1>general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or they have bad strategies for </v>

56
00:02:46.571 --> 00:02:48.640
<v Speaker 1>learning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both of those are things you can change.</v>

57
00:02:48.641 --> 00:02:52.450
<v Speaker 1>So people can get good with languages </v>
<v Speaker 1>even if they're not right.</v>

58
00:02:52.451 --> 00:02:53.284
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me tell you just a couple of </v>

59
00:02:55.081 --> 00:02:55.914
<v Speaker 1>examples.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

60
00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.903
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one guy who I used to work with at my </v>

61
00:02:57.911 --> 00:02:59.770
<v Speaker 1>previous job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he told me,</v>

62
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.331
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

63
00:03:00.331 --> 00:03:01.164
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can speak Japanese quite well and he </v>

64
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.950
<v Speaker 1>can't speak Japanese very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was saying to me,</v>

65
00:03:05.951 --> 00:03:07.660
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish I could speak at like you.</v>

66
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:08.523
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

67
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.150
<v Speaker 1>why don't you do it then?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

68
00:03:10.151 --> 00:03:10.990
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've tried,</v>

69
00:03:10.991 --> 00:03:14.090
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not good with languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which made my eyebrows raise.</v>

70
00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.040
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>

71
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.990
<v Speaker 1>How much do you study?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

72
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.861
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I study,</v>

73
00:03:17.861 --> 00:03:19.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I have time.</v>

74
00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.270
<v Speaker 1>And that was the first red flag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just when I have time,</v>

75
00:03:22.271 --> 00:03:24.970
<v Speaker 1>that's an excuse to not commit to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>study schedule.</v>

76
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.871
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

77
00:03:25.871 --> 00:03:26.800
<v Speaker 1>how often?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

78
00:03:26.801 --> 00:03:28.510
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once or twice a week sometimes.</v>

79
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:29.501
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I said,</v>

80
00:03:29.501 --> 00:03:31.510
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you study on those days,</v>

81
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:32.710
<v Speaker 1>how much do you study?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he says,</v>

82
00:03:32.711 --> 00:03:33.544
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try to do a page or two and my </v>

83
00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:36.130
<v Speaker 1>textbook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

84
00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.460
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean try?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you do a page or two or we're not?</v>

85
00:03:39.461 --> 00:03:40.300
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

86
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.490
<v Speaker 1>sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so all these things,</v>

87
00:03:42.491 --> 00:03:45.290
<v Speaker 1>like you sometimes do a page or two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

88
00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.380
<v Speaker 1>you tried to do a page or two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean?</v>

89
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:48.850
<v Speaker 1>You either do it or you don't.</v>

90
00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:53.303
<v Speaker 1>There is no try.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're going to do three pages </v>

91
00:03:55.901 --> 00:03:57.040
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do three pages,</v>

92
00:03:57.041 --> 00:03:58.840
<v Speaker 1>don't do a page and then go on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm tired,</v>

93
00:03:58.841 --> 00:03:59.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go watch TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

94
00:03:59.981 --> 00:04:03.310
<v Speaker 1>screw that you do your three pages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the kind of commitment.</v>

95
00:04:03.311 --> 00:04:06.040
<v Speaker 1>That's the kind of habit that you need </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get good at a language.</v>

96
00:04:06.041 --> 00:04:06.874
<v Speaker 1>It's that ability to just set a goal and</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight through it because you enjoy it </v>

97
00:04:10.181 --> 00:04:13.180
<v Speaker 1>and because you want to reach that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that goal at the end,</v>

98
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.400
<v Speaker 1>and that's part of the process is just </v>
<v Speaker 1>committing to it.</v>

99
00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.090
<v Speaker 1>So some people can force themselves to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do that and those are the people who are</v>

100
00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.610
<v Speaker 1>supposedly good with languages for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most part.</v>

101
00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:26.770
<v Speaker 1>Another example is someone who has just </v>
<v Speaker 1>a kind of habit or a learning style or a</v>

102
00:04:27.431 --> 00:04:31.030
<v Speaker 1>personality trait that kind of blocks </v>
<v Speaker 1>them from getting good at the language.</v>

103
00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.330
<v Speaker 1>I know another guy who tried to learn </v>
<v Speaker 1>Japanese,</v>

104
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.050
<v Speaker 1>kind of tried to learn Japanese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he never made any progress with it.</v>

105
00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.060
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I would always ask them,</v>

106
00:04:40.061 --> 00:04:40.840
<v Speaker 1>how's it going?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

107
00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.160
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not so easy.</v>

108
00:04:42.161 --> 00:04:45.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm not good with languages like you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would dig in a little bit.</v>

109
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.110
<v Speaker 1>And what it is is this guy just loves to</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk your ear off.</v>

110
00:04:50.111 --> 00:04:51.700
<v Speaker 1>He's one of these people who just talks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talks,</v>

111
00:04:51.701 --> 00:04:52.181
<v Speaker 1>talks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talks,</v>

112
00:04:52.181 --> 00:04:55.540
<v Speaker 1>talks all the time really fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he can't slow himself down.</v>

113
00:04:55.541 --> 00:04:58.540
<v Speaker 1>And he absolutely hates listening to </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people.</v>

114
00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.490
<v Speaker 1>Like stopping his own voice to listen to</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people is,</v>

115
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.420
<v Speaker 1>it causes him like psychological terror </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost.</v>

116
00:05:04.421 --> 00:05:05.670
<v Speaker 1>He just hates it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

117
00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:06.753
<v Speaker 1>so he's not someone who can slow himself</v>
<v Speaker 1>down enough to really go slowly when </v>

118
00:05:10.961 --> 00:05:11.794
<v Speaker 1>learning a language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has to just say all his ideas right </v>

119
00:05:13.811 --> 00:05:15.280
<v Speaker 1>away or he feels freaked out.</v>

120
00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.353
<v Speaker 1>So when you're learning a language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course you need to sometimes go </v>

121
00:05:18.401 --> 00:05:19.600
<v Speaker 1>slowly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to,</v>

122
00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:20.793
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

123
00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:21.693
<v Speaker 1>process the concepts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>process the patterns and piece together </v>

124
00:05:23.891 --> 00:05:26.080
<v Speaker 1>your sentences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to just,</v>

125
00:05:26.081 --> 00:05:26.914
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to slow down to make your </v>

126
00:05:28.271 --> 00:05:31.120
<v Speaker 1>speech more accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you are not used to doing that,</v>

127
00:05:31.121 --> 00:05:35.170
<v Speaker 1>if you have a personality trait that </v>
<v Speaker 1>inhibits you from slowing down,</v>

128
00:05:35.171 --> 00:05:37.060
<v Speaker 1>and that means you need to change that </v>
<v Speaker 1>strategy,</v>

129
00:05:37.061 --> 00:05:42.061
<v Speaker 1>you need to work on that part of your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of your personality in order to help you</v>

130
00:05:42.131 --> 00:05:43.480
<v Speaker 1>learn better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

131
00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:46.420
<v Speaker 1>So it's not that that guy is not good </v>
<v Speaker 1>with languages is that he,</v>

132
00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.100
<v Speaker 1>he has this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

133
00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:51.430
<v Speaker 1>this pattern of behavior that stops him </v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

134
00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.160
<v Speaker 1>from pushing forward in his learning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

135
00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:55.173
<v Speaker 1>So if he can work on that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then he can get better with learning </v>

136
00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.913
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you have trouble learning </v>

137
00:05:59.121 --> 00:06:01.490
<v Speaker 1>languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could be one of those two things.</v>

138
00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:02.323
<v Speaker 1>It could be that you don't have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>study habits so you don't have the </v>

139
00:06:04.821 --> 00:06:05.654
<v Speaker 1>habits of setting goals and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting through all of the bullshit </v>

140
00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:10.460
<v Speaker 1>that you have to go through to reach </v>
<v Speaker 1>your goal.</v>

141
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:12.650
<v Speaker 1>Or it could be that you have some kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

142
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:13.830
<v Speaker 1>some kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

143
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:15.163
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trait or some kind of pattern that's </v>

144
00:06:16.731 --> 00:06:19.520
<v Speaker 1>inhibiting your learning and you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out what that is.</v>

145
00:06:19.521 --> 00:06:20.354
<v Speaker 1>And try to work around that or try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>change it so you can learn more </v>

146
00:06:23.031 --> 00:06:25.190
<v Speaker 1>efficiently and not have to keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>stopping.</v>

147
00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:26.533
<v Speaker 1>So that's my basic message.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you think you're not good with </v>

148
00:06:28.431 --> 00:06:29.264
<v Speaker 1>languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I basically disagree with you and I </v>

149
00:06:31.701 --> 00:06:32.534
<v Speaker 1>think you could be good with languages </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you just change something around and </v>

150
00:06:36.111 --> 00:06:38.300
<v Speaker 1>change your patterns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>change your habits.</v>

151
00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:40.670
<v Speaker 1>Nobody is inherently good with </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>

152
00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.430
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's inherently bad with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have a good day.</v>
