00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.340
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea how to make a funny </v>
<v Speaker 1>introduction for this video,</v>

2
00:00:03.341 --> 00:00:05.950
<v Speaker 1>so instead I'm going to give you a quick</v>
<v Speaker 1>slideshow of cool,</v>

3
00:00:05.951 --> 00:00:07.150
<v Speaker 1>awesome slavek stuff.</v>

4
00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:08.083
<v Speaker 2>Go.</v>

5
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:18.863
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and </v>

6
00:00:20.611 --> 00:00:24.210
<v Speaker 1>my name is Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today I'm going to talk about the Slavic</v>

7
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.073
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They may not get as much attention as </v>

8
00:00:27.271 --> 00:00:29.520
<v Speaker 1>the romance languages and the Germanic </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages,</v>

9
00:00:29.521 --> 00:00:30.354
<v Speaker 1>but the Slavic languages are an </v>
<v Speaker 1>important family of languages with $315 </v>

10
00:00:33.741 --> 00:00:37.170
<v Speaker 1>million native speakers and covering </v>
<v Speaker 1>over half the area of Europe.</v>

11
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.293
<v Speaker 1>That includes Eastern Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the balcones as well as the European </v>

12
00:00:41.701 --> 00:00:42.534
<v Speaker 1>part of Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course the Asian part of Russia </v>

13
00:00:44.491 --> 00:00:48.210
<v Speaker 1>as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Slavic languages or a branch of the Indo</v>

14
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.043
<v Speaker 1>European language family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we go all the way back to the </v>

15
00:00:51.271 --> 00:00:53.410
<v Speaker 1>beginning that there was a language </v>
<v Speaker 1>called [inaudible],</v>

16
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.293
<v Speaker 1>Indo European,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the language from which all </v>

17
00:00:56.131 --> 00:00:59.790
<v Speaker 1>Indo European languages descended.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That includes the romance languages.</v>

18
00:00:59.791 --> 00:01:00.624
<v Speaker 1>That dramatic language is to enjoy </v>
<v Speaker 1>running in languages and of course the </v>

19
00:01:03.121 --> 00:01:03.954
<v Speaker 1>Slavic languages as well as others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One language that developed from Indo </v>

20
00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.440
<v Speaker 1>European was pro tow Bulto Slavic.</v>

21
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:11.423
<v Speaker 1>That language is the ancestor of both </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Baltic languages and the Slavic </v>

22
00:01:14.551 --> 00:01:17.280
<v Speaker 1>languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the Slavic language family broke off</v>

23
00:01:17.281 --> 00:01:21.990
<v Speaker 1>from Provo Balto slavek around 1,500</v>
<v Speaker 1>to 1000 bce.</v>

24
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.160
<v Speaker 1>The language then underwent a 2000 year </v>
<v Speaker 1>period of gradual development,</v>

25
00:01:26.161 --> 00:01:30.540
<v Speaker 1>but during that time it remained a </v>
<v Speaker 1>single unified language around 500 ce.</v>

26
00:01:30.541 --> 00:01:31.374
<v Speaker 1>There was a language called protos </v>
<v Speaker 1>slavic that would later split and would </v>

27
00:01:34.111 --> 00:01:37.050
<v Speaker 1>give birth to all of the modern Slavic </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages of today.</v>

28
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.620
<v Speaker 1>Protos slavek was the ancestor of all </v>
<v Speaker 1>Slavic languages.</v>

29
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.513
<v Speaker 1>The time between 500 cm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1000 ce was called the common slavek </v>

30
00:01:45.121 --> 00:01:46.530
<v Speaker 1>period,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and during this period,</v>

31
00:01:46.531 --> 00:01:51.531
<v Speaker 1>protos slavek began to diverge into </v>
<v Speaker 1>dialects and that Slavic people migrated</v>

32
00:01:51.631 --> 00:01:52.464
<v Speaker 1>over a wider area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those differences increased by about </v>

33
00:01:55.171 --> 00:01:58.350
<v Speaker 1>$1,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seed there were distinct west Slavek,</v>

34
00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:02.820
<v Speaker 1>east Slavic and South Slavic languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those three languages would later become</v>

35
00:02:02.821 --> 00:02:05.490
<v Speaker 1>three branches of the Slavic language </v>
<v Speaker 1>family,</v>

36
00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.443
<v Speaker 1>and the dialects of those languages </v>
<v Speaker 1>would become the different languages in </v>

37
00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:10.013
<v Speaker 1>each branch.</v>

38
00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.780
<v Speaker 1>The East Slavic languages include </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russian,</v>

39
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.960
<v Speaker 1>Ukrainian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Bella Lucien,</v>

40
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:15.803
<v Speaker 1>which is sometimes called White Russian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>South Slavic language family includes </v>

41
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:21.720
<v Speaker 1>Serbo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Croatian,</v>

42
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.210
<v Speaker 1>Bulgarian Macedonian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are very similar,</v>

43
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.133
<v Speaker 1>Slovenian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also the liturgical language known </v>

44
00:02:27.541 --> 00:02:31.110
<v Speaker 1>as old church.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Slavonic slavonic just means Slavic.</v>

45
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.140
<v Speaker 1>The West Slavic languages include </v>
<v Speaker 1>Polish,</v>

46
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.400
<v Speaker 1>Czech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Slovak,</v>

47
00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:36.303
<v Speaker 1>Serbian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a minority language in eastern </v>

48
00:02:38.011 --> 00:02:40.950
<v Speaker 1>Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>job in which is a minority language.</v>

49
00:02:40.951 --> 00:02:41.784
<v Speaker 1>In Poland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Slavic languages are much closer to </v>

50
00:02:44.761 --> 00:02:48.390
<v Speaker 1>each other then the languages of other </v>
<v Speaker 1>into European language families.</v>

51
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.373
<v Speaker 1>That's because protos slavek split into </v>
<v Speaker 1>different languages relatively recently </v>

52
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.040
<v Speaker 1>compared to other language families like</v>
<v Speaker 1>Germanic and romance.</v>

53
00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.010
<v Speaker 1>Some people claimed that all slavic </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages are mutually intelligible to a</v>

54
00:03:00.011 --> 00:03:01.780
<v Speaker 1>large degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not really true,</v>

55
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:02.793
<v Speaker 1>but from what I understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the speaker of any Slavic language can </v>

56
00:03:05.801 --> 00:03:06.634
<v Speaker 1>probably find a way to make some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>simple conversation with the speaker of </v>

57
00:03:10.061 --> 00:03:13.240
<v Speaker 1>any other Slavic language or most other </v>
<v Speaker 1>Slavic languages.</v>

58
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.250
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean they can understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>

59
00:03:15.251 --> 00:03:17.260
<v Speaker 1>but that means when they're talking face</v>
<v Speaker 1>to face,</v>

60
00:03:17.261 --> 00:03:18.094
<v Speaker 1>maybe they can find a way to communicate</v>
<v Speaker 1>and within each of those three branches </v>

61
00:03:21.341 --> 00:03:22.174
<v Speaker 1>of the language family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there seems to be quite a lot of mutual </v>

62
00:03:24.311 --> 00:03:25.900
<v Speaker 1>intelligibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

63
00:03:25.901 --> 00:03:26.734
<v Speaker 1>the East slavek branch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here are some average figures from </v>

64
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.210
<v Speaker 1>native speakers statements on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet,</v>

65
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:32.253
<v Speaker 1>so for Russian speakers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bella Lucien is about 74 percent </v>

66
00:03:35.471 --> 00:03:36.304
<v Speaker 1>intelligible and it's spoken for them an</v>
<v Speaker 1>85 percent intelligible in its written </v>

67
00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:43.060
<v Speaker 1>form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ukrainian is 50 percent intelligible and</v>

68
00:03:43.061 --> 00:03:46.780
<v Speaker 1>it's spoken for them and 85 percent </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligible in its written form,</v>

69
00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.630
<v Speaker 1>but in both cases there were also a </v>
<v Speaker 1>transitional dialects.</v>

70
00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:50.493
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Ukrainian is more similar to the </v>

71
00:03:52.541 --> 00:03:53.374
<v Speaker 1>Russian dialects in the south of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country rather than the standard </v>

72
00:03:55.691 --> 00:03:58.270
<v Speaker 1>language which is based on dialects of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the north,</v>

73
00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:59.163
<v Speaker 1>so speakers of those southern Russian </v>
<v Speaker 1>dialects might have an easier time </v>

74
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.640
<v Speaker 1>communicating with someone from Ukraine.</v>

75
00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.870
<v Speaker 1>Here's another example from a lang focus</v>
<v Speaker 1>viewer named anointed fighter.</v>

76
00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.270
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a native Bulgarian speaker.</v>

77
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.690
<v Speaker 1>I can understand 80 percent Serbian and </v>
<v Speaker 1>80 percent Russian,</v>

78
00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:14.553
<v Speaker 1>especially if they are written Czech </v>
<v Speaker 1>Slovakia and Slovenia and I can get 60 </v>

79
00:04:17.861 --> 00:04:22.270
<v Speaker 1>percent and from Polish only 40 percent </v>
<v Speaker 1>to Bulgaria and Serbia and are both part</v>

80
00:04:22.271 --> 00:04:26.050
<v Speaker 1>of the South Slavic branch so he can </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand 80 percent of Serbian,</v>

81
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:27.063
<v Speaker 1>but he can also understand 80 percent of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russian even though it's in the East </v>

82
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:30.513
<v Speaker 1>slavek branch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Slavic was still a single unified </v>

83
00:04:32.531 --> 00:04:33.364
<v Speaker 1>language in the ninth century when the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first known slavic writings were </v>

84
00:04:36.251 --> 00:04:37.084
<v Speaker 1>written.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These writings were written in old </v>

85
00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.840
<v Speaker 1>church slavonic slavonic just means </v>
<v Speaker 1>slavek.</v>

86
00:04:40.841 --> 00:04:41.674
<v Speaker 1>Remember it was the first slavek </v>
<v Speaker 1>literary language and it was </v>

87
00:04:43.841 --> 00:04:44.674
<v Speaker 1>standardized by the Saint Cyril and </v>
<v Speaker 1>methodius so that they could translate </v>

88
00:04:47.831 --> 00:04:48.664
<v Speaker 1>the Bible and other religious works into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Slavic language and they could </v>

89
00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.090
<v Speaker 1>minister to the slabs and convert them </v>
<v Speaker 1>to Christianity.</v>

90
00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.300
<v Speaker 1>At this point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were slavic dialects,</v>

91
00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.290
<v Speaker 1>but they were still relatively close to </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>

92
00:04:59.291 --> 00:05:02.410
<v Speaker 1>So old church slavonic was widely </v>
<v Speaker 1>understood.</v>

93
00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:03.453
<v Speaker 1>Old Church slavonic went on to become </v>
<v Speaker 1>the language of religious ceremony for </v>

94
00:05:06.851 --> 00:05:09.940
<v Speaker 1>the eastern Orthodox Church and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>eastern Catholic church,</v>

95
00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.190
<v Speaker 1>and it's still used by many churches </v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

96
00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:13.203
<v Speaker 1>One of the writing system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cyril and methodius used to write old </v>

97
00:05:15.581 --> 00:05:16.414
<v Speaker 1>church slavonic was the cyrillic script,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the word cyrillic comes from the </v>

98
00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.020
<v Speaker 1>Saints Names Cyril.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The cyrillic script was adapted from the</v>

99
00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:28.050
<v Speaker 1>old Greek script with some additional </v>
<v Speaker 1>letters to represent sounds found in old</v>

100
00:05:28.151 --> 00:05:30.850
<v Speaker 1>church slavonic that were not found in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Greek today.</v>

101
00:05:30.851 --> 00:05:34.450
<v Speaker 1>There are Slavic languages written in </v>
<v Speaker 1>cyrillic script and there are also those</v>

102
00:05:34.451 --> 00:05:36.940
<v Speaker 1>written in variations of the Latin </v>
<v Speaker 1>script.</v>

103
00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:37.923
<v Speaker 1>Those written in the cyrillic script </v>
<v Speaker 1>tend to be for cultures in which the </v>

104
00:05:40.421 --> 00:05:43.690
<v Speaker 1>eastern Orthodox or eastern Catholic </v>
<v Speaker 1>church are dominant.</v>

105
00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:44.703
<v Speaker 1>Those written in the Latin script tend </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be for cultures in which the Roman </v>

106
00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.790
<v Speaker 1>Catholic church is dominant.</v>

107
00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:49.803
<v Speaker 1>One of the common features of Slavic </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages aside from Bulgarian and </v>

108
00:05:52.771 --> 00:05:57.070
<v Speaker 1>Macedonian is that the nouns and </v>
<v Speaker 1>pronouns are highly inflected.</v>

109
00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:58.123
<v Speaker 1>Have many grammatical cases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Grammatical case means that the noun or </v>

110
00:06:01.011 --> 00:06:05.210
<v Speaker 1>a pronoun changes form depending on its </v>
<v Speaker 1>function in the sentence in English.</v>

111
00:06:05.211 --> 00:06:07.730
<v Speaker 1>The only example we have of this is with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pronouns.</v>

112
00:06:07.731 --> 00:06:08.564
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I is the subject for him and me is the </v>

113
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:12.133
<v Speaker 1>object form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nouns can have multiple forums like </v>

114
00:06:14.241 --> 00:06:16.610
<v Speaker 1>this as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they have grammatical cases,</v>

115
00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.970
<v Speaker 1>Slavic languages have up to seven </v>
<v Speaker 1>different grammatical cases.</v>

116
00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:20.983
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at an example for the Polish </v>
<v Speaker 1>word for bottle with Telefonica </v>

117
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:28.120
<v Speaker 1>Boutiquey hotel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a Teleco Teleco.</v>

118
00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:29.433
<v Speaker 1>We tell them say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the word bottle changes form </v>

119
00:06:31.461 --> 00:06:32.294
<v Speaker 1>depending on which case it's being used.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't go through each one and say </v>

120
00:06:34.851 --> 00:06:35.684
<v Speaker 1>which case it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can see that the form of the </v>

121
00:06:37.371 --> 00:06:38.204
<v Speaker 1>noun changes for people whose native </v>
<v Speaker 1>language is not a highly inflected </v>

122
00:06:41.601 --> 00:06:43.570
<v Speaker 1>language with grammatical cases like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

123
00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:45.680
<v Speaker 1>This can make learning a slavic </v>
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>

124
00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:46.543
<v Speaker 1>a challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You not only have to memorize those </v>

125
00:06:47.901 --> 00:06:49.580
<v Speaker 1>different forums,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you're speaking,</v>

126
00:06:49.581 --> 00:06:53.000
<v Speaker 1>you have to constantly be aware of which</v>
<v Speaker 1>form the word should be,</v>

127
00:06:53.001 --> 00:06:55.430
<v Speaker 1>which function the word is fulfilling in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sentence.</v>

128
00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:56.503
<v Speaker 1>Another characteristic of Slavic </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages is that they don't have </v>

129
00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:01.910
<v Speaker 1>articles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means like the or are in English,</v>

130
00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:05.270
<v Speaker 1>and again the exception is Bulgarian and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Macedonian.</v>

131
00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:09.410
<v Speaker 1>For some reason the lack of grammatical </v>
<v Speaker 1>cases and the presence of articles might</v>

132
00:07:09.411 --> 00:07:11.600
<v Speaker 1>make Bulgarian Macedonian easier to </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn,</v>

133
00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:12.643
<v Speaker 1>but the most widely studied slavic </v>
<v Speaker 1>language is Russian and that's probably </v>

134
00:07:15.771 --> 00:07:16.604
<v Speaker 1>because it's the most widely spoken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are $150 million native speakers </v>

135
00:07:20.031 --> 00:07:20.864
<v Speaker 1>of Russian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if we include second language </v>

136
00:07:22.191 --> 00:07:23.024
<v Speaker 1>speakers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are $260 million proficient </v>

137
00:07:24.921 --> 00:07:25.754
<v Speaker 1>speakers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second most widely spoken is Polish </v>

138
00:07:28.041 --> 00:07:28.874
<v Speaker 1>with around $40 million native speakers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The third most widely spoken is </v>

139
00:07:31.911 --> 00:07:34.220
<v Speaker 1>Ukrainian with about $30 million </v>
<v Speaker 1>speakers.</v>

140
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:38.420
<v Speaker 1>The fourth is Serbo Croatian with about </v>
<v Speaker 1>19 million speakers and yes,</v>

141
00:07:38.421 --> 00:07:41.540
<v Speaker 1>I know some people consider those to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>separate languages,</v>

142
00:07:41.541 --> 00:07:44.420
<v Speaker 1>but I will leave that topic for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>different video for now.</v>

143
00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:45.523
<v Speaker 1>The fifth is checked with 10 million </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and of course there are numerous </v>

144
00:07:48.621 --> 00:07:51.200
<v Speaker 1>other important slavic languages to </v>
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>

145
00:07:51.201 --> 00:07:52.034
<v Speaker 1>There's so much to say about the various</v>
<v Speaker 1>different Slavic languages that I can't </v>

146
00:07:54.531 --> 00:07:55.364
<v Speaker 1>talk about it all in one video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but please stay tuned for future videos </v>

147
00:07:58.251 --> 00:08:00.950
<v Speaker 1>in which I talk about specific Slavic </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>

148
00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:02.840
<v Speaker 1>So that brings us to the end of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>video.</v>

149
00:08:02.841 --> 00:08:07.310
<v Speaker 1>But the question of the day for Slavic </v>
<v Speaker 1>language speakers is can you communicate</v>

150
00:08:07.311 --> 00:08:10.610
<v Speaker 1>with the speakers of different slavic </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages and if so,</v>

151
00:08:10.611 --> 00:08:11.444
<v Speaker 1>which ones?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it just the ones in your language </v>

152
00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:15.290
<v Speaker 1>branch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like East Slavek or South Slavic,</v>

153
00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:18.890
<v Speaker 1>or can you communicate with the speakers</v>
<v Speaker 1>in other branches as well?</v>

154
00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:19.903
<v Speaker 1>Let us know in the comments down below </v>
<v Speaker 1>and other people you can comment about </v>

155
00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.650
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

156
00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:26.950
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for watching and have a nice.</v>
