00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.020
<v Speaker 1>Hi Guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today I'm going to talk about this book,</v>

2
00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:04.243
<v Speaker 1>teach yourself Arabic and I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell you whether it is a genius work of </v>

3
00:00:07.521 --> 00:00:10.250
<v Speaker 1>art or a piece of crap from hell.</v>

4
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.513
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

5
00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.020
<v Speaker 1>good afternoon guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to talk today about a book and</v>

6
00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:24.050
<v Speaker 1>CD program that I used in the past to </v>
<v Speaker 1>study Arabic.</v>

7
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:25.093
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's called teach yourself Arabic from </v>

8
00:00:26.871 --> 00:00:31.730
<v Speaker 1>the infamous teach yourself series a in </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's this book right here by Jack smarts</v>

9
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.720
<v Speaker 1>and Francis El Toro for or something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

10
00:00:35.721 --> 00:00:37.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to say his last name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all.</v>

11
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.650
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should say upfront.</v>

12
00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.500
<v Speaker 1>I want to be careful that we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the same book.</v>

13
00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.470
<v Speaker 1>There are actually two books called </v>
<v Speaker 1>teach yourself Arabic.</v>

14
00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.220
<v Speaker 1>This one right here is the old one from </v>
<v Speaker 1>1991.</v>

15
00:00:49.221 --> 00:00:52.640
<v Speaker 1>This one is basically focused on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

16
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.440
<v Speaker 1>on receptive skills on reading and </v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to Arabic.</v>

17
00:00:57.441 --> 00:01:01.130
<v Speaker 1>It's not really focused on </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversational or communicative Arabic.</v>

18
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:02.323
<v Speaker 1>That one is kind of universally </v>
<v Speaker 1>lambasted by people who buy it because </v>

19
00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.610
<v Speaker 1>when they buy a teacher yourself booked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're hoping to learn to communicate.</v>

20
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:11.630
<v Speaker 1>Most people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

21
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:12.793
<v Speaker 1>And that book is basically based on um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reading and listening to the news in </v>

22
00:01:17.991 --> 00:01:20.300
<v Speaker 1>Arabic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really the purpose of that book.</v>

23
00:01:20.301 --> 00:01:21.134
<v Speaker 1>So we're gonna focus on this one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the new one published in 2001 </v>

24
00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.380
<v Speaker 1>and it has a much more community </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicative,</v>

25
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.333
<v Speaker 1>conversational focus and it's much more </v>
<v Speaker 1>suitable for the average learner who </v>

26
00:01:32.961 --> 00:01:35.840
<v Speaker 1>buys teach yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we'll talk about this.</v>

27
00:01:35.841 --> 00:01:39.950
<v Speaker 1>It's a pretty good book but it has some </v>
<v Speaker 1>weaknesses.</v>

28
00:01:39.951 --> 00:01:40.784
<v Speaker 1>So I want to talk about those just to </v>
<v Speaker 1>give you an idea and that will help you </v>

29
00:01:43.701 --> 00:01:47.120
<v Speaker 1>maybe use the book better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So first of all,</v>

30
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.133
<v Speaker 1>the book is based on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's teaching you modern standard </v>

31
00:01:51.591 --> 00:01:54.440
<v Speaker 1>Arabic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the formal kind of Arabic,</v>

32
00:01:54.441 --> 00:01:57.470
<v Speaker 1>the standard Arabic that is used in </v>
<v Speaker 1>newspapers.</v>

33
00:01:57.471 --> 00:01:58.304
<v Speaker 1>It's used in the media and it's used </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of as a tool to to communicate </v>

34
00:02:02.841 --> 00:02:06.110
<v Speaker 1>across dialects because Arabic has a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of different dialects.</v>

35
00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.370
<v Speaker 1>So when people want to communicate with </v>
<v Speaker 1>a speaker of another dialect,</v>

36
00:02:10.371 --> 00:02:11.204
<v Speaker 1>they kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they incorporate some of the standard </v>

37
00:02:13.701 --> 00:02:17.480
<v Speaker 1>language into their speech to make it </v>
<v Speaker 1>understandable for the other person.</v>

38
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.003
<v Speaker 1>So this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is all about modern standard </v>

39
00:02:20.991 --> 00:02:21.824
<v Speaker 1>Arabic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it teaches it in a way that is </v>

40
00:02:22.851 --> 00:02:26.990
<v Speaker 1>communicative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversational and helps you to interact</v>

41
00:02:26.991 --> 00:02:29.570
<v Speaker 1>in daily situations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's kind of rare.</v>

42
00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.420
<v Speaker 1>There are some other books now that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that do the same thing,</v>

43
00:02:32.421 --> 00:02:34.850
<v Speaker 1>but a few years ago this was kind of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>only,</v>

44
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.630
<v Speaker 1>the only popular book like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only common book like that.</v>

45
00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:39.493
<v Speaker 1>And it was kind of rare to find in </v>
<v Speaker 1>modern standard Arabic book that did </v>

46
00:02:43.071 --> 00:02:43.904
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

47
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.530
<v Speaker 1>so it's good for that and it's good in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the language that it teaches.</v>

48
00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.420
<v Speaker 1>Like if you look at unit one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

49
00:02:50.421 --> 00:02:50.871
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>

50
00:02:50.871 --> 00:02:51.291
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>

51
00:02:51.291 --> 00:02:52.124
<v Speaker 1>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those they teach good language that's </v>

52
00:02:54.111 --> 00:02:54.944
<v Speaker 1>useful in daily situations in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary of presents I think is </v>

53
00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.790
<v Speaker 1>useful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>presented in a logical order.</v>

54
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.953
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gives you a lot of experience with </v>

55
00:03:04.481 --> 00:03:05.314
<v Speaker 1>different language skills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not only just the reading and </v>

56
00:03:07.811 --> 00:03:08.644
<v Speaker 1>the listening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it gives you a chance to do some </v>

57
00:03:11.711 --> 00:03:15.640
<v Speaker 1>writing exercises and that gives you a </v>
<v Speaker 1>chance to do some grammar exercises.</v>

58
00:03:15.641 --> 00:03:17.830
<v Speaker 1>It's got a good balance of skills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find.</v>

59
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.320
<v Speaker 1>Of course you're not speaking with </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone,</v>

60
00:03:20.321 --> 00:03:22.120
<v Speaker 1>you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's listening to you and giving you</v>

61
00:03:22.121 --> 00:03:24.310
<v Speaker 1>feedback unless you have a private </v>
<v Speaker 1>teacher.</v>

62
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.680
<v Speaker 1>But it covers all of the bases to </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever extent a book like this can.</v>

63
00:03:29.681 --> 00:03:30.514
<v Speaker 1>So it is a regular teacher self book </v>
<v Speaker 1>even though it's based on a modern </v>

64
00:03:34.541 --> 00:03:36.390
<v Speaker 1>standard Arabic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's good,</v>

65
00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good in that sense.</v>

66
00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:41.620
<v Speaker 1>The strange thing about this book is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it switches gears suddenly,</v>

67
00:03:41.621 --> 00:03:46.600
<v Speaker 1>like the first seven units are based on </v>
<v Speaker 1>good conversational situations,</v>

68
00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:50.440
<v Speaker 1>daily life situations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then in unit eight it switches gears and</v>

69
00:03:50.441 --> 00:03:54.730
<v Speaker 1>throws you in head first into this </v>
<v Speaker 1>traditional story about Sinbad,</v>

70
00:03:54.731 --> 00:03:55.564
<v Speaker 1>the sailor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's actually an authentic </v>

71
00:03:57.071 --> 00:03:57.904
<v Speaker 1>text from a book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from some old book and it's written in </v>

72
00:04:00.521 --> 00:04:01.354
<v Speaker 1>very kind of archaic Arabic and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>throw you in head first and you're </v>

73
00:04:04.331 --> 00:04:05.230
<v Speaker 1>reading this going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

74
00:04:05.231 --> 00:04:06.400
<v Speaker 1>I haven't learned this stuff yet.</v>

75
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.233
<v Speaker 1>Why am I reading about Sinbad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sailor using these archaic sentence </v>

76
00:04:10.271 --> 00:04:11.104
<v Speaker 1>structures?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I found that unit quite frustrating </v>

77
00:04:13.841 --> 00:04:16.300
<v Speaker 1>and it made me want to stop using the </v>
<v Speaker 1>book to be honest,</v>

78
00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.770
<v Speaker 1>because there were things in that story </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I couldn't find in this book that I</v>

79
00:04:20.771 --> 00:04:22.530
<v Speaker 1>couldn't find them in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

80
00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:23.793
<v Speaker 1>on the internet and Google as trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>s to search and find what these </v>

81
00:04:26.171 --> 00:04:28.120
<v Speaker 1>grammatical structures mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it couldn't.</v>

82
00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.050
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I think the idea that they had was to</v>

83
00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:33.423
<v Speaker 1>force you to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to understand the main meaning without </v>

84
00:04:36.341 --> 00:04:37.174
<v Speaker 1>understanding everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if they do that without explaining </v>

85
00:04:40.901 --> 00:04:43.060
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they do that suddenly,</v>

86
00:04:43.061 --> 00:04:43.894
<v Speaker 1>even though the first seven units were </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of different than it's a shock to </v>

87
00:04:46.601 --> 00:04:48.640
<v Speaker 1>your system and you're going to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>frustrated.</v>

88
00:04:48.641 --> 00:04:53.290
<v Speaker 1>So I found unit eight was annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unit nine was similar because they threw</v>

89
00:04:53.291 --> 00:04:58.291
<v Speaker 1>you in to a bunch of advertisements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the advertisements from a newspaper</v>

90
00:04:59.471 --> 00:05:00.304
<v Speaker 1>or a magazine.</v>

91
00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.530
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there were some apartment ads,</v>

92
00:05:02.531 --> 00:05:06.940
<v Speaker 1>like looking for an apartment and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>exercises ask you questions and you have</v>

93
00:05:06.941 --> 00:05:09.940
<v Speaker 1>to answer it based on these </v>
<v Speaker 1>advertisements.</v>

94
00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:11.043
<v Speaker 1>But the advertisements are full of words</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you haven't seen before and it's </v>

95
00:05:14.411 --> 00:05:16.730
<v Speaker 1>just really hard to decipher them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

96
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.113
<v Speaker 1>and there's not a lot of guidance or </v>
<v Speaker 1>explanation about the goal of that </v>

97
00:05:20.801 --> 00:05:23.360
<v Speaker 1>exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if they had said like,</v>

98
00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:26.410
<v Speaker 1>do the goal here is just a scan for </v>
<v Speaker 1>important information,</v>

99
00:05:26.411 --> 00:05:27.244
<v Speaker 1>don't worry about everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then maybe it would be easier for </v>

100
00:05:30.491 --> 00:05:33.820
<v Speaker 1>learners to get through and not worry </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the stuff they're missing.</v>

101
00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.010
<v Speaker 1>But it doesn't really do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just throws you in,</v>

102
00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:37.023
<v Speaker 1>you confused because you're expected to </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal with all this language you haven't </v>

103
00:05:40.001 --> 00:05:40.834
<v Speaker 1>learned yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a weakness of this book cause </v>

104
00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.033
<v Speaker 1>that that element,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's written by two people and I have </v>

105
00:05:46.811 --> 00:05:47.644
<v Speaker 1>the feeling that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>units one to seven were written by one </v>

106
00:05:50.261 --> 00:05:51.910
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unit eight and nine,</v>

107
00:05:51.911 --> 00:05:54.940
<v Speaker 1>and some of the others were written by </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone else.</v>

108
00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.380
<v Speaker 1>That could be true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure.</v>

109
00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.220
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>later on in the book,</v>

110
00:05:58.221 --> 00:06:02.660
<v Speaker 1>some of the chapters get back to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicative focus and that's good.</v>

111
00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.390
<v Speaker 1>But some of them are still unclear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there were,</v>

112
00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:06.253
<v Speaker 1>there are some sections where you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>thrown in head first without adequate </v>

113
00:06:09.351 --> 00:06:10.400
<v Speaker 1>guidance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel.</v>

114
00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:11.923
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another weakness of the book is that at </v>

115
00:06:15.771 --> 00:06:20.570
<v Speaker 1>some vocabulary appears in the exercises</v>
<v Speaker 1>or in the texts that is not taught.</v>

116
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:21.643
<v Speaker 1>It's not given to you in the book and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not in the glossary at the back of </v>

117
00:06:25.101 --> 00:06:26.840
<v Speaker 1>the book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for,</v>

118
00:06:26.841 --> 00:06:27.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

119
00:06:27.891 --> 00:06:30.140
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a new learner who has just bought one of</v>

120
00:06:30.141 --> 00:06:30.974
<v Speaker 1>these books and doesn't have an arsenal </v>
<v Speaker 1>of dictionaries and grammar reference </v>

121
00:06:34.671 --> 00:06:37.430
<v Speaker 1>books and stuff yet that's really </v>
<v Speaker 1>frustrating.</v>

122
00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:38.663
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the most frustrating things </v>

123
00:06:39.801 --> 00:06:43.070
<v Speaker 1>to look in the glossary and not find the</v>
<v Speaker 1>word you're looking for,</v>

124
00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:45.440
<v Speaker 1>especially when it appears in this book.</v>

125
00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:49.670
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're also very simple words.</v>

126
00:06:49.671 --> 00:06:50.504
<v Speaker 1>I tried to look up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I remember when I was using this </v>

127
00:06:52.341 --> 00:06:53.174
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember thinking to myself like </v>

128
00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:57.620
<v Speaker 1>almost every time I went to look up a </v>
<v Speaker 1>word in the glossary,</v>

129
00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:00.080
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even when it was a really simple English</v>

130
00:07:00.081 --> 00:07:00.914
<v Speaker 1>word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would look it up and it wouldn't be </v>

131
00:07:01.821 --> 00:07:03.170
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would always be thinking,</v>

132
00:07:03.171 --> 00:07:06.080
<v Speaker 1>why isn't that word in this book?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why isn't it in the glossary?</v>

133
00:07:06.081 --> 00:07:07.580
<v Speaker 1>That's such a simple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basic word.</v>

134
00:07:07.581 --> 00:07:09.340
<v Speaker 1>It should be in here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

135
00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:11.840
<v Speaker 1>so the glossary is not up to snuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

136
00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:13.493
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they should really make sure that </v>

137
00:07:15.291 --> 00:07:17.790
<v Speaker 1>everything we're expected to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

138
00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:18.843
<v Speaker 1>expected to deal with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the words were expected to </v>

139
00:07:20.391 --> 00:07:22.340
<v Speaker 1>understand it should be taught in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>

140
00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:25.340
<v Speaker 1>So they don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To get around that,</v>

141
00:07:25.341 --> 00:07:26.174
<v Speaker 1>you need to have a good dictionary and </v>
<v Speaker 1>to know how to look up words in that </v>

142
00:07:28.881 --> 00:07:31.760
<v Speaker 1>dictionary using the root or whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>the system is.</v>

143
00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:35.720
<v Speaker 1>So get a dictionary and that will help </v>
<v Speaker 1>you out a lot with this.</v>

144
00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:37.550
<v Speaker 1>So with that said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's good.</v>

145
00:07:37.551 --> 00:07:38.384
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does teach good language and it </v>

146
00:07:39.741 --> 00:07:42.850
<v Speaker 1>teaches good situations and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

147
00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:44.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

148
00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:45.053
<v Speaker 1>it teaches modern standard Arabic in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>way that is useful for you to use as a </v>

149
00:07:48.891 --> 00:07:52.520
<v Speaker 1>communication tool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So just be prepared for those weaknesses</v>

150
00:07:52.521 --> 00:07:54.250
<v Speaker 1>if you get this book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

151
00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:57.830
<v Speaker 1>just that there are some parts that </v>
<v Speaker 1>throw you in head first without a lot of</v>

152
00:07:57.831 --> 00:08:00.140
<v Speaker 1>support.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're an inductive learner,</v>

153
00:08:00.141 --> 00:08:03.470
<v Speaker 1>if you're someone who likes to figure </v>
<v Speaker 1>things out without a lot of help,</v>

154
00:08:03.471 --> 00:08:07.400
<v Speaker 1>then you might enjoy that and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>slugged through it and find that fun.</v>

155
00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:08.713
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you're a more traditional </v>

156
00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:10.933
<v Speaker 1>deductive learner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you like to get the instruction up </v>

157
00:08:12.801 --> 00:08:14.180
<v Speaker 1>front,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>

158
00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:15.111
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

159
00:08:15.111 --> 00:08:15.944
<v Speaker 1>everything that comes after that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then this book might frustrate you a </v>

160
00:08:18.621 --> 00:08:20.450
<v Speaker 1>bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's good.</v>

161
00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:23.120
<v Speaker 1>I'll give it 3.5</v>
<v Speaker 1>stars out of five.</v>

162
00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:25.490
<v Speaker 1>Not the best,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not the worst.</v>

163
00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:29.760
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for listening and have a nice,</v>

164
00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:35.653
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
