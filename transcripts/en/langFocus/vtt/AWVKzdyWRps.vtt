00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.953
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and </v>

2
00:00:03.151 --> 00:00:03.984
<v Speaker 1>my name is Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today we'll be answering the question </v>

3
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.510
<v Speaker 1>how similar our German and Dutch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

4
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.750
<v Speaker 1>what were those two languages again?</v>
<v Speaker 1>German Deutsche,</v>

5
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.130
<v Speaker 1>Dutch Nadir loans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Deutsche.</v>

6
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:19.343
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it strange that English speakers </v>
<v Speaker 1>called the language of the Netherlands </v>

7
00:00:21.991 --> 00:00:25.650
<v Speaker 1>and Flanders Dutch while German speakers</v>
<v Speaker 1>called their own language?</v>

8
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.300
<v Speaker 1>Deutsche,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is that?</v>

9
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.240
<v Speaker 1>It's because there's a connection </v>
<v Speaker 1>between Dutch and German.</v>

10
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.193
<v Speaker 1>Both are Germanic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The English word Dutch used to refer to </v>

11
00:00:33.931 --> 00:00:34.764
<v Speaker 1>continental Germanic peoples in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then came to refer to only the </v>

12
00:00:38.251 --> 00:00:42.150
<v Speaker 1>people of the Netherlands because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>greater contact and rivalry with them.</v>

13
00:00:42.151 --> 00:00:42.984
<v Speaker 1>In particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the English word comes from the Middle </v>

14
00:00:44.911 --> 00:00:48.540
<v Speaker 1>Dutch word do teach and in modern Dutch </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dutch,</v>

15
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:49.583
<v Speaker 1>which means German,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is a cognate of the German </v>

16
00:00:51.811 --> 00:00:52.830
<v Speaker 1>word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Deutsche.</v>

17
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.400
<v Speaker 1>And with that we've already begun </v>
<v Speaker 1>comparing the two languages.</v>

18
00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.990
<v Speaker 1>In Dutch they say Dutch and in German </v>
<v Speaker 1>they say Deutsche.</v>

19
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.910
<v Speaker 1>Germanic and Dutch are both members of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the West Germanic branch of the Germanic</v>

20
00:01:05.911 --> 00:01:08.670
<v Speaker 1>language family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both developed from the same root,</v>

21
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.430
<v Speaker 1>the same ancestor language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pro Germanic,</v>

22
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.120
<v Speaker 1>which developed into Western,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eastern and northern dialect groups.</v>

23
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.133
<v Speaker 1>The Western dialects are the ancestors </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Dutch and German and the other west </v>

24
00:01:19.321 --> 00:01:20.154
<v Speaker 1>Germanic languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One thing we have to keep in mind when </v>

25
00:01:23.131 --> 00:01:26.910
<v Speaker 1>comparing Dutch and German is that there</v>
<v Speaker 1>are many dialects of Dutch and there are</v>

26
00:01:26.911 --> 00:01:30.840
<v Speaker 1>many dialects of German and in northern </v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany and parts of Netherlands,</v>

27
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.660
<v Speaker 1>there are dialects that arguably form </v>
<v Speaker 1>another language,</v>

28
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:34.523
<v Speaker 1>low German or low Saxon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's another regional language </v>

29
00:01:37.141 --> 00:01:37.974
<v Speaker 1>called Frisian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but speakers of all of these dialects </v>

30
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.123
<v Speaker 1>learn either standard Dutch or standard </v>
<v Speaker 1>German depending on which country they </v>

31
00:01:44.371 --> 00:01:45.204
<v Speaker 1>live in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there may be cases when German and </v>

32
00:01:46.981 --> 00:01:47.814
<v Speaker 1>Dutch speakers understand each other </v>
<v Speaker 1>more easily when their dialects are </v>

33
00:01:50.461 --> 00:01:51.294
<v Speaker 1>closer to each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are other situations in which </v>

34
00:01:53.671 --> 00:01:54.504
<v Speaker 1>their dialects are further apart and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be easiest to communicate in the </v>

35
00:01:57.331 --> 00:01:58.350
<v Speaker 1>standard languages.</v>

36
00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.393
<v Speaker 1>In this video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll focus on standard Dutch and </v>

37
00:02:01.171 --> 00:02:05.850
<v Speaker 1>standard German vocabulary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dutch and German share a large amount of</v>

38
00:02:05.851 --> 00:02:06.684
<v Speaker 1>cognitive vocabulary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>According to one source I've seen their </v>

39
00:02:09.061 --> 00:02:09.894
<v Speaker 1>lexical similarity is around 84% which </v>
<v Speaker 1>is slightly lower than Spanish and </v>

40
00:02:13.861 --> 00:02:18.861
<v Speaker 1>Italian or Spanish and Portuguese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>84% lexical similarity doesn't mean that</v>

41
00:02:19.021 --> 00:02:23.160
<v Speaker 1>84% of the words are exactly the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means that they are cognates.</v>

42
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.820
<v Speaker 1>They come from a common origin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they may have a different form or be</v>

43
00:02:26.821 --> 00:02:28.830
<v Speaker 1>pronounced differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some examples,</v>

44
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.873
<v Speaker 1>the word for glass in German and in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dutch plus the word for water in German </v>

45
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.590
<v Speaker 1>and in Dutch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That or the word for dog,</v>

46
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.110
<v Speaker 1>hence the word for brother Buddha,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Buddha,</v>

47
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.140
<v Speaker 1>but this here is actually an archaic </v>
<v Speaker 1>form of the word.</v>

48
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.410
<v Speaker 1>The modern form of the word is the word </v>
<v Speaker 1>for sister Smith Zoster.</v>

49
00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.800
<v Speaker 1>This is also an archaic form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The modern form is just,</v>

50
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:01.780
<v Speaker 1>and here are a couple of phrases.</v>

51
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.190
<v Speaker 1>Good Morning Guten Morgen who?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Morgan,</v>

52
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.700
<v Speaker 1>good day or good afternoon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guten tag.</v>

53
00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.983
<v Speaker 1>Who did?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

54
00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.100
<v Speaker 1>it's sunny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sunny.</v>

55
00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.450
<v Speaker 1>Who dish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are a lot of cognates like that,</v>

56
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.570
<v Speaker 1>but there are false cognates as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Dutch.</v>

57
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.660
<v Speaker 1>J Means C and Mir means lake in German.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Z means lake and mia mean C,</v>

58
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.940
<v Speaker 1>but there's actually a bit more to it </v>
<v Speaker 1>than that.</v>

59
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.890
<v Speaker 1>There's actually a masculine word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>desi meaning lake and a feminine word.</v>

60
00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:36.793
<v Speaker 1>Dizzy meaning see in Dutch Leeson means </v>
<v Speaker 1>to lie as an to tell a lie in German </v>

61
00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.620
<v Speaker 1>leagon means to lie as in to lie down on</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bed.</v>

62
00:03:47.621 --> 00:03:48.454
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Dutch listen means to lie on </v>

63
00:03:51.461 --> 00:03:55.930
<v Speaker 1>something like a bed in German.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Logan means to tell a lie.</v>

64
00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.590
<v Speaker 1>In Dutch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>painless means painful,</v>

65
00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:03.460
<v Speaker 1>but in German normally means </v>
<v Speaker 1>embarrassing.</v>

66
00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.180
<v Speaker 1>In Dutch [inaudible] mean it's be </v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed to and in German means to like,</v>

67
00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:11.860
<v Speaker 1>but hold on a second.</v>

68
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:12.723
<v Speaker 1>The Dutch word can also be used with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning to like specifically when you </v>

69
00:04:16.091 --> 00:04:16.924
<v Speaker 1>like a person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the German word is used more generally </v>

70
00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.863
<v Speaker 1>for people or things you like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even though a lot of cognates may be </v>

71
00:04:23.831 --> 00:04:24.664
<v Speaker 1>obvious or easy to decipher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>assuming that they mean the same thing </v>

72
00:04:27.851 --> 00:04:30.190
<v Speaker 1>might cause some confusion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pronunciation,</v>

73
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you noticed that most of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>cognate words sounded a little different</v>

74
00:04:34.031 --> 00:04:35.860
<v Speaker 1>and some of them sounded quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

75
00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.850
<v Speaker 1>One of the biggest differences between </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dutch and German is the different sounds</v>

76
00:04:39.851 --> 00:04:43.540
<v Speaker 1>in either language and how these results</v>
<v Speaker 1>in cognate words that sound different.</v>

77
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:44.643
<v Speaker 1>Some of the differences between Dutch </v>
<v Speaker 1>and German are a result of the high </v>

78
00:04:47.261 --> 00:04:48.094
<v Speaker 1>German consonant shift which took place </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the few hundred years leading up to </v>

79
00:04:51.341 --> 00:04:52.174
<v Speaker 1>the ninth century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>German descends from dialects that were </v>

80
00:04:54.311 --> 00:04:55.144
<v Speaker 1>affected by these changes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While Dutch descends from dialects that </v>

81
00:04:57.731 --> 00:05:01.510
<v Speaker 1>were not affected by these changes </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the shift,</v>

82
00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.480
<v Speaker 1>voiceless stops to and come in.</v>

83
00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:05.313
<v Speaker 1>Dutch tend to be fricatives for sup and </v>
<v Speaker 1>in German cognates when between vowels </v>

84
00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.960
<v Speaker 1>or after a vowel at the end of a word </v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

85
00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.823
<v Speaker 1>the words meaning ship in Dutch skip and</v>
<v Speaker 1>in German shoes and the words meaning </v>

86
00:05:20.501 --> 00:05:21.334
<v Speaker 1>water in Dutch that are and in German </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the Pronoun meaning I in Dutch Ig </v>

87
00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:29.523
<v Speaker 1>and in German these same voiceless stops</v>
<v Speaker 1>became Africans for sub or at the </v>

88
00:05:36.761 --> 00:05:41.140
<v Speaker 1>beginning of a word or if they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>doubled consonants or if they came after</v>

89
00:05:41.141 --> 00:05:43.270
<v Speaker 1>an l or our sound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

90
00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:48.480
<v Speaker 1>the words for apple in Dutch fucking and</v>
<v Speaker 1>in German and the words meaning heart in</v>

91
00:05:50.351 --> 00:05:51.184
<v Speaker 1>Dutch hearts and in German.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The third challenge cup changing to cut </v>

92
00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:00.470
<v Speaker 1>occurred only an upper German dialect </v>
<v Speaker 1>and not in standard German.</v>

93
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.460
<v Speaker 1>Another shift also took place in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>voice stops,</v>

94
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:08.960
<v Speaker 1>Buh Duh and gum which became voiceless </v>
<v Speaker 1>and cook,</v>

95
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:13.010
<v Speaker 1>but with only the dump to touch shift </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking place in standard German.</v>

96
00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:16.130
<v Speaker 1>The other changes only took place in </v>
<v Speaker 1>upper German dialects.</v>

97
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:17.083
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the word for day in Dutch and in German </v>

98
00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:24.050
<v Speaker 1>tack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember before when I said that certain</v>

99
00:06:24.051 --> 00:06:24.884
<v Speaker 1>German speakers would have an easier </v>
<v Speaker 1>time understanding Dutch because of </v>

100
00:06:27.561 --> 00:06:28.730
<v Speaker 1>their dialects?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

101
00:06:28.731 --> 00:06:32.720
<v Speaker 1>that's especially true for low German </v>
<v Speaker 1>dialects because like Dutch,</v>

102
00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:35.600
<v Speaker 1>they didn't undergo this hydromatic </v>
<v Speaker 1>consonant shift.</v>

103
00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:40.460
<v Speaker 1>There was another sound change that </v>
<v Speaker 1>affected high German but also low German</v>

104
00:06:40.461 --> 00:06:41.294
<v Speaker 1>and Dutch thumb and the became duck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This explains why Germans still has a </v>

105
00:06:46.131 --> 00:06:49.810
<v Speaker 1>Duh sound even though there was an </v>
<v Speaker 1>earlier shift from Dakota.</v>

106
00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:50.863
<v Speaker 1>There are also other sound differences </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are not a result of the hydromatic </v>

107
00:06:53.931 --> 00:06:54.764
<v Speaker 1>consonant shift.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Notice the different g sounds in the </v>

108
00:06:57.111 --> 00:06:57.944
<v Speaker 1>word for God in Dutch holds and in </v>
<v Speaker 1>German the German is more or less like </v>

109
00:07:03.981 --> 00:07:07.070
<v Speaker 1>the English good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That Dutch sound varies depending on the</v>

110
00:07:07.071 --> 00:07:09.770
<v Speaker 1>region,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as a villa or uvular fricative,</v>

111
00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:11.323
<v Speaker 1>you may have also noticed that the wwe </v>
<v Speaker 1>sounded different in the words for </v>

112
00:07:13.941 --> 00:07:15.560
<v Speaker 1>water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's hear those again.</v>

113
00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:16.453
<v Speaker 1>In Dutch Vassar and in German,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the German sound is similar to the v </v>

114
00:07:21.171 --> 00:07:22.070
<v Speaker 1>sound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In English,</v>

115
00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:23.203
<v Speaker 1>the Dutch W is pronounced differently in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the beginning or in the middle of the </v>

116
00:07:26.031 --> 00:07:26.864
<v Speaker 1>word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of between a va and the what </v>

117
00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.380
<v Speaker 1>sounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the end of a word,</v>

118
00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:32.120
<v Speaker 1>after a vowel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a glide.</v>

119
00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:33.103
<v Speaker 1>Just like w in English,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our sounds are sounds very quite a lot </v>

120
00:07:37.371 --> 00:07:39.950
<v Speaker 1>in either language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on where the speakers from,</v>

121
00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:42.020
<v Speaker 1>but they're often different in either </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

122
00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:43.003
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the word for year in Dutch and in </v>

123
00:07:46.041 --> 00:07:47.410
<v Speaker 1>German.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

124
00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:48.613
<v Speaker 1>in the Dutch word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The final r sounds like a retroflex </v>

125
00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:55.010
<v Speaker 1>approximate raw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in some varieties of English,</v>

126
00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:55.933
<v Speaker 1>but other speakers say it as a trilled </v>
<v Speaker 1>are and when it's not at the end of the </v>

127
00:07:58.911 --> 00:08:00.050
<v Speaker 1>word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the trilled are,</v>

128
00:08:00.051 --> 00:08:00.884
<v Speaker 1>is more consistently used,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in northern areas and in the </v>

129
00:08:04.251 --> 00:08:06.710
<v Speaker 1>German word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Rs pronounced as a vowel.</v>

130
00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:08.053
<v Speaker 1>It's also pronounced as a vowel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In some other contexts like between </v>

131
00:08:10.791 --> 00:08:14.030
<v Speaker 1>vowels or after a long vowel and before </v>
<v Speaker 1>another consonant.</v>

132
00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:17.150
<v Speaker 1>In other contexts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more like a voice to uvular,</v>

133
00:08:17.151 --> 00:08:18.960
<v Speaker 1>fricative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

134
00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:21.350
<v Speaker 1>at least in a standard accent of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany.</v>

135
00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:25.400
<v Speaker 1>Here's another example using the words </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning rough in Dutch.</v>

136
00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:27.013
<v Speaker 1>Here you can clearly hear the trilled </v>
<v Speaker 1>are and in German some consonants are </v>

137
00:08:31.971 --> 00:08:32.804
<v Speaker 1>spelled the same but sound different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some are spelled differently and sound </v>

138
00:08:35.811 --> 00:08:39.110
<v Speaker 1>different and others are spelled </v>
<v Speaker 1>differently but sounded the same.</v>

139
00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:43.430
<v Speaker 1>One example is that Czi is spelled as </v>
<v Speaker 1>zed in Dutch,</v>

140
00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:47.000
<v Speaker 1>but as s in German,</v>
<v Speaker 1>German s is also pronounced,</v>

141
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:51.290
<v Speaker 1>so at the end of a word or after </v>
<v Speaker 1>consonants other than l and nasals,</v>

142
00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:56.310
<v Speaker 1>two words we saw earlier are German and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dutch Zuma.</v>

143
00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:59.460
<v Speaker 1>There are many differences in vowels as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

144
00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:00.443
<v Speaker 1>Some are spelled differently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sound basically the same like the </v>

145
00:09:02.821 --> 00:09:04.770
<v Speaker 1>words meaning year that we saw a minute </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>

146
00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:09.540
<v Speaker 1>Let's hear those again and focus on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>vowel in Dutch and in German.</v>

147
00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:10.693
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>notice that the vowel is spelled </v>

148
00:09:12.181 --> 00:09:14.010
<v Speaker 1>differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another example,</v>

149
00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:17.730
<v Speaker 1>the words meaning good in Dutch hoots </v>
<v Speaker 1>and in German.</v>

150
00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:20.723
<v Speaker 1>There were also a lot of pairs of </v>
<v Speaker 1>cognates in which the vowel sounds have </v>

151
00:09:23.251 --> 00:09:25.650
<v Speaker 1>become different and that is reflected </v>
<v Speaker 1>in their spelling.</v>

152
00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:26.723
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their words for dream in Dutch and in </v>

153
00:09:29.911 --> 00:09:30.744
<v Speaker 1>German town along o vowel in Dutch often</v>
<v Speaker 1>corresponds with this diphthong in </v>

154
00:09:35.131 --> 00:09:35.964
<v Speaker 1>German the words meaning body but to </v>
<v Speaker 1>cognate with the English word life in </v>

155
00:09:40.411 --> 00:09:41.244
<v Speaker 1>Dutch lace and in German.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These diphthongs often correspond with </v>

156
00:09:46.021 --> 00:09:46.854
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another similar example is the word for </v>

157
00:09:48.571 --> 00:09:49.404
<v Speaker 1>bite in Dutch Bayton and in German Bison</v>
<v Speaker 1>also notice this German letter that </v>

158
00:09:55.291 --> 00:09:56.124
<v Speaker 1>represents the sound sub after long </v>
<v Speaker 1>vowels or diphthongs as opposed to a </v>

159
00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:03.350
<v Speaker 1>double s after short vowels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This orthographic symbols,</v>

160
00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:05.520
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't exist in Dutch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Dutch,</v>

161
00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:06.383
<v Speaker 1>so is always represented by a single s </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's worth noting that this symbol </v>

162
00:10:10.381 --> 00:10:12.660
<v Speaker 1>is not used in Swiss standard German </v>
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>

163
00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:15.870
<v Speaker 1>They always write it as a double s </v>
<v Speaker 1>grammar.</v>

164
00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:17.243
<v Speaker 1>There are some important similarities </v>
<v Speaker 1>and some important differences between </v>

165
00:10:19.771 --> 00:10:20.604
<v Speaker 1>the grammar of the two languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One difference is their use of </v>

166
00:10:22.891 --> 00:10:25.590
<v Speaker 1>grammatical gender.</v>
<v Speaker 1>German has three genders,</v>

167
00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:27.480
<v Speaker 1>masculine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feminine and Neuter,</v>

168
00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:31.350
<v Speaker 1>which applied to announce their articles</v>
<v Speaker 1>and adjectives that modify them.</v>

169
00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:34.050
<v Speaker 1>Dutch historically had the same three </v>
<v Speaker 1>genders,</v>

170
00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:35.940
<v Speaker 1>but in practice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in modern Dutch,</v>

171
00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:39.600
<v Speaker 1>masculine and feminine essentially form </v>
<v Speaker 1>a single common gender.</v>

172
00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:43.530
<v Speaker 1>So the only grammatical distinction is </v>
<v Speaker 1>between common gender and neuter.</v>

173
00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:46.890
<v Speaker 1>And related to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>German has three definite articles.</v>

174
00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:50.160
<v Speaker 1>While duck has two and for indefinite </v>
<v Speaker 1>articles,</v>

175
00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:52.770
<v Speaker 1>German has just two and Dutch has just </v>
<v Speaker 1>won.</v>

176
00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:56.460
<v Speaker 1>Another difference is that German has </v>
<v Speaker 1>nauman cases,</v>

177
00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:59.970
<v Speaker 1>different forms of nouns depending on </v>
<v Speaker 1>their function in the sentence.</v>

178
00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:03.720
<v Speaker 1>The four cases in German are nominative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>genitive Datas,</v>

179
00:11:03.721 --> 00:11:06.750
<v Speaker 1>and accusative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dutch used to have now in cases,</v>

180
00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:07.613
<v Speaker 1>but they fell out of use in the spoken </v>
<v Speaker 1>language and in the 1940s they were </v>

181
00:11:10.591 --> 00:11:12.210
<v Speaker 1>dropped from the standard language.</v>

182
00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:15.240
<v Speaker 1>Now they appear and some older idioms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's about it.</v>

183
00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:19.680
<v Speaker 1>That lack of noun cases arguably makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dutch easier to learn than German,</v>

184
00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:22.020
<v Speaker 1>at least in that particular way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

185
00:11:22.021 --> 00:11:26.010
<v Speaker 1>and remember a minute ago when I said </v>
<v Speaker 1>that German has three definite articles.</v>

186
00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:27.900
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's actually not that simple.</v>

187
00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:28.973
<v Speaker 1>Each definite article has some </v>
<v Speaker 1>variations depending on the announced </v>

188
00:11:31.531 --> 00:11:32.364
<v Speaker 1>case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at the nominative and </v>

189
00:11:33.661 --> 00:11:34.494
<v Speaker 1>accusative cases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just to illustrate these sentences mean </v>

190
00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:42.050
<v Speaker 1>the red fish is expensive in German and </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Dutch,</v>

191
00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:45.930
<v Speaker 1>Dutch road as this is dear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you can see,</v>

192
00:11:45.931 --> 00:11:48.840
<v Speaker 1>the sentences can be translated word for</v>
<v Speaker 1>word from English.</v>

193
00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:49.943
<v Speaker 1>The function of the phrases meaning the </v>
<v Speaker 1>red fish is nominative because the </v>

194
00:11:53.351 --> 00:11:54.184
<v Speaker 1>subject of either sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these sentences mean I like the red </v>

195
00:11:57.521 --> 00:11:58.840
<v Speaker 1>fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In German</v>

196
00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:00.640
<v Speaker 2>marketing [inaudible]</v>

197
00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:06.410
<v Speaker 1>and in Dutch it often the low disease </v>
<v Speaker 1>here at the phrases meaning the red fish</v>

198
00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:07.913
<v Speaker 1>are the direct object,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means their function is </v>

199
00:12:09.871 --> 00:12:10.704
<v Speaker 1>accusative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see that in Dutch the noun </v>

200
00:12:12.721 --> 00:12:16.200
<v Speaker 1>phrase stays the same despite its </v>
<v Speaker 1>accusative function in the sentence,</v>

201
00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:19.290
<v Speaker 1>but in German the accusative form is </v>
<v Speaker 1>different then.</v>

202
00:12:19.291 --> 00:12:22.920
<v Speaker 1>Now that self doesn't have a special </v>
<v Speaker 1>ending that's different depending on the</v>

203
00:12:22.921 --> 00:12:26.100
<v Speaker 1>gender and the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the definite article changes and the</v>

204
00:12:26.101 --> 00:12:26.934
<v Speaker 1>adjective has a special ending.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you consider the different case </v>

205
00:12:29.761 --> 00:12:32.370
<v Speaker 1>forms for nouns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>articles and adjectives,</v>

206
00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:34.500
<v Speaker 1>there are a lot of possible </v>
<v Speaker 1>combinations.</v>

207
00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:39.590
<v Speaker 1>These are for definite noun phrases and </v>
<v Speaker 1>these are for indefinite noun phrases.</v>

208
00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:41.243
<v Speaker 1>Learning the different cases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forms has a challenge for learners of </v>

209
00:12:43.141 --> 00:12:44.730
<v Speaker 1>German,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you learn Dutch,</v>

210
00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:48.390
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to memorize all those </v>
<v Speaker 1>different forms and endings which affect</v>

211
00:12:48.391 --> 00:12:49.500
<v Speaker 1>nouns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>adjectives,</v>

212
00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:50.760
<v Speaker 1>articles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and possessives,</v>

213
00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:52.440
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Word order.</v>

214
00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:53.483
<v Speaker 1>In the sentence we just saw the word </v>
<v Speaker 1>order was essentially the same in both </v>

215
00:12:56.311 --> 00:12:58.680
<v Speaker 1>languages and both were the same as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>English.</v>

216
00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:01.980
<v Speaker 1>In the following sentences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they share the same syntax,</v>

217
00:13:01.981 --> 00:13:02.814
<v Speaker 1>but they're different from English.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These sentences mean I can play the </v>

218
00:13:05.511 --> 00:13:07.420
<v Speaker 1>piano very well in German</v>

219
00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:08.690
<v Speaker 2>can zack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good,</v>

220
00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:10.920
<v Speaker 2>Claudia speedin and in Dutch</v>

221
00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:14.700
<v Speaker 1>ECOM,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's piano spelling word for word?</v>

222
00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:19.760
<v Speaker 1>Both sentences are I can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very good piano play in both sentences.</v>

223
00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:24.390
<v Speaker 1>The conjugated verb and auxiliary verb </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes second after the subject.</v>

224
00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:25.373
<v Speaker 1>Both languages feature Vitu word order </v>
<v Speaker 1>and in both languages the unconjugated </v>

225
00:13:29.341 --> 00:13:30.174
<v Speaker 1>verb moves to the end for clarity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's simplify those previous sentences </v>

226
00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:37.700
<v Speaker 1>by removing the adverb phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now they mean I can play the piano.</v>

227
00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:40.590
<v Speaker 2>In German he can clavio spillman</v>

228
00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:41.773
<v Speaker 1>and in Dutch it come pianos Balan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now let's add something so that they </v>

229
00:13:45.891 --> 00:13:48.170
<v Speaker 1>mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to be able to play the piano</v>

230
00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:51.760
<v Speaker 2>in German.</v>

<v Speaker 1>word for word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

232
00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:56.200
<v Speaker 1>I want piano play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be able to,</v>

233
00:13:57.090 --> 00:13:59.520
<v Speaker 1>and in Dutch it Kerrville,</v>
<v Speaker 1>piano,</v>

234
00:13:59.521 --> 00:14:01.470
<v Speaker 1>cleanness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spillane word for word.</v>

235
00:14:01.471 --> 00:14:06.220
<v Speaker 1>It's I want piano be able to play in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dutch.</v>

236
00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:09.580
<v Speaker 1>When another auxiliary verbus added this</v>
<v Speaker 1>auxiliary verb,</v>

237
00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:10.493
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] gets moved back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the main lexical verb is still at </v>

238
00:14:13.301 --> 00:14:14.620
<v Speaker 1>the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In German,</v>

239
00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:17.680
<v Speaker 1>the equivalent auxiliary verb gets moved</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the end.</v>

240
00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:18.723
<v Speaker 1>After the lexical verb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same difference occurs in relative </v>

241
00:14:21.701 --> 00:14:24.550
<v Speaker 1>clauses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These sentences mean he knows that I can</v>

242
00:14:24.551 --> 00:14:25.384
<v Speaker 1>play the piano</v>

243
00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:28.760
<v Speaker 2>in German advice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does he clubish Billington</v>

244
00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:29.973
<v Speaker 1>word for word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's he knows that I piano play Ken and </v>

245
00:14:34.031 --> 00:14:38.530
<v Speaker 1>in Dutch hiv-aids don't take piano </v>
<v Speaker 1>concert and word for word eds.</v>

246
00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:39.423
<v Speaker 1>He knows that I piano Ken play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So while the word order is generally </v>

247
00:14:43.951 --> 00:14:44.784
<v Speaker 1>similar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are some differences in the </v>

248
00:14:45.841 --> 00:14:46.674
<v Speaker 1>details like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at one more final sentence </v>

249
00:14:49.021 --> 00:14:51.060
<v Speaker 1>and see what we find.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's compare two.</v>

250
00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:55.490
<v Speaker 1>Meaning if I had enough money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd buy a car first in Dutch,</v>

251
00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:58.350
<v Speaker 1>Joelton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alto,</v>

252
00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:02.150
<v Speaker 1>copen word for word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's if I enough money,</v>

253
00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:06.440
<v Speaker 1>had wood I uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>car by next in German.</v>

254
00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:11.480
<v Speaker 1>Verdad Ishmael,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to them word for word.</v>

255
00:15:11.481 --> 00:15:16.481
<v Speaker 1>It's if I enough money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had wood I myself a car by.</v>

256
00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:20.180
<v Speaker 1>These are both conditional sentences </v>
<v Speaker 1>with two clauses,</v>

257
00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:22.910
<v Speaker 1>an if clause and the main clause.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First.</v>

258
00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:27.110
<v Speaker 1>You might notice that even though I said</v>
<v Speaker 1>both languages have Vitu word order,</v>

259
00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:30.560
<v Speaker 1>neither of these sentences seem to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>verbs in the second position.</v>

260
00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:31.543
<v Speaker 1>In the first clause,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the verb comes last and in the second </v>

261
00:15:34.071 --> 00:15:34.904
<v Speaker 1>clause the verb comes first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well this here is the main clause or </v>

262
00:15:38.301 --> 00:15:41.390
<v Speaker 1>independent clause.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we should focus on this when thinking</v>

263
00:15:41.391 --> 00:15:42.224
<v Speaker 1>about Vitu word order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If this clause alone where the entire </v>

264
00:15:44.691 --> 00:15:48.650
<v Speaker 1>sentence than the subject would come </v>
<v Speaker 1>first and the verb would come second,</v>

265
00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:52.400
<v Speaker 1>making it Vitu word order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This here is the dependent clause.</v>

266
00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:54.920
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a sentence by itself.</v>

267
00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:57.380
<v Speaker 1>It only adds information to the main </v>
<v Speaker 1>clause.</v>

268
00:15:57.530 --> 00:15:58.363
<v Speaker 1>So this whole dependent clause occupies </v>
<v Speaker 1>the first position and in the main </v>

269
00:16:01.851 --> 00:16:02.684
<v Speaker 1>clause,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the verb moves before the subject to </v>

270
00:16:04.461 --> 00:16:08.960
<v Speaker 1>occupy second position,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making it Vitu word order first.</v>

271
00:16:08.961 --> 00:16:11.030
<v Speaker 1>We can see that the words for if are </v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

272
00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:12.073
<v Speaker 1>Then we have the slightly different </v>
<v Speaker 1>cognates meaning I hear we have cognate </v>

273
00:16:15.441 --> 00:16:16.520
<v Speaker 1>words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning enough.</v>

274
00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:17.473
<v Speaker 1>Notice that the vowel sound the same but</v>
<v Speaker 1>are spelled differently and notice that </v>

275
00:16:20.631 --> 00:16:23.870
<v Speaker 1>the letter g looks the same but sounds </v>
<v Speaker 1>different in Dutch.</v>

276
00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:24.733
<v Speaker 1>The g sounds are Uvula fricatives ha.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Next we have the cognate words for </v>

277
00:16:29.031 --> 00:16:29.864
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next word is an important one in </v>

278
00:16:31.671 --> 00:16:34.250
<v Speaker 1>Dutch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This if clause simply has the past tense</v>

279
00:16:34.251 --> 00:16:38.180
<v Speaker 1>form of the verb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heaven meaning to have in German.</v>

280
00:16:38.181 --> 00:16:39.014
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a subjunctive verb form </v>

281
00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:41.413
<v Speaker 1>something that Dutch doesn't have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Subjunctive forms are used to express </v>

282
00:16:44.511 --> 00:16:45.344
<v Speaker 1>hypothetical situations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>express doubt or express something you </v>

283
00:16:48.291 --> 00:16:49.124
<v Speaker 1>wish were true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Next we see the auxiliary verbs in the </v>

284
00:16:51.741 --> 00:16:52.574
<v Speaker 1>main clause which both translate as </v>
<v Speaker 1>would the German word is for past </v>

285
00:16:56.061 --> 00:17:01.061
<v Speaker 1>subjunctive form of that in and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dutch word is the past tense of Xulane,</v>

286
00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:04.760
<v Speaker 1>which by the way is a cognate of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>English word Shell.</v>

287
00:17:05.570 --> 00:17:07.940
<v Speaker 1>Notice that in German there's an extra </v>
<v Speaker 1>word here.</v>

288
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:08.833
<v Speaker 1>This word is a reflexive pronoun which </v>
<v Speaker 1>is used to show that you are buying </v>

289
00:17:11.781 --> 00:17:12.614
<v Speaker 1>something for yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the data form of the first </v>

290
00:17:15.111 --> 00:17:16.370
<v Speaker 1>person singular pronoun.</v>

291
00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:20.720
<v Speaker 1>This is not completely necessary but as </v>
<v Speaker 1>commonly used in this context.</v>

292
00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:24.380
<v Speaker 1>In Standard Dutch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reflexive pronoun is not used here.</v>

293
00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:27.860
<v Speaker 1>Next we have the indefinite articles </v>
<v Speaker 1>which are cognates.</v>

294
00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:30.740
<v Speaker 1>The German one though is the nuder </v>
<v Speaker 1>accusative form.</v>

295
00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:33.920
<v Speaker 1>While in Dutch there's only one form of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the indefinite article.</v>

296
00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:36.350
<v Speaker 1>Next,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the word for car is similar.</v>

297
00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:39.380
<v Speaker 1>The Dutch word is in the common gender.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

298
00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:40.243
<v Speaker 1>historically masculine or feminine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The German word is neuter gender and in </v>

299
00:17:43.701 --> 00:17:47.030
<v Speaker 1>the accusative form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this form takes no special ending to</v>

300
00:17:47.031 --> 00:17:50.700
<v Speaker 1>distinguish it for some genders and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>does and for others it doesn't.</v>

301
00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:55.400
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see the word for by Copeland in Dutch</v>

302
00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:56.233
<v Speaker 1>Kalfen in German,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the German consonant sound foot as a </v>

303
00:17:58.651 --> 00:17:59.484
<v Speaker 1>result of the hydromatic consonant shift</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we talked about earlier and also </v>

304
00:18:02.911 --> 00:18:03.744
<v Speaker 1>notice the different vowel sound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are a lot of similarities between </v>

305
00:18:07.351 --> 00:18:10.770
<v Speaker 1>those two sentences we just looked at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are also a lot of differences,</v>

306
00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:14.070
<v Speaker 1>probably enough for you to realize that </v>
<v Speaker 1>to a large extent,</v>

307
00:18:14.071 --> 00:18:16.560
<v Speaker 1>German and Dutch are not mutually </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligible.</v>

308
00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:19.500
<v Speaker 1>For people who haven't been exposed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the other very much.</v>

309
00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:23.310
<v Speaker 1>Words in isolation or short phrases </v>
<v Speaker 1>might be mutually intelligible.</v>

310
00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:26.850
<v Speaker 1>But when mixed in with different words </v>
<v Speaker 1>and when spoken at full speed,</v>

311
00:18:26.851 --> 00:18:27.684
<v Speaker 1>it becomes much harder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And just like with other pairs of </v>

312
00:18:29.671 --> 00:18:30.504
<v Speaker 1>closely related languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>speakers of Dutch and German often say </v>

313
00:18:33.091 --> 00:18:33.924
<v Speaker 1>that they can understand the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>language much more in its written form </v>

314
00:18:36.301 --> 00:18:39.560
<v Speaker 1>than in it's spoken form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like I said earlier in the video,</v>

315
00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:40.423
<v Speaker 1>speakers of certain dialects might have </v>
<v Speaker 1>a much easier time understanding the </v>

316
00:18:43.231 --> 00:18:44.064
<v Speaker 1>other language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question of the day for native </v>

317
00:18:45.811 --> 00:18:46.644
<v Speaker 1>speakers of Dutch or German,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how well do you understand the other </v>

318
00:18:48.901 --> 00:18:51.690
<v Speaker 1>language and if you've ever studied the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other language,</v>

319
00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:52.553
<v Speaker 1>what was your experience like and for </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people after seeing the examples </v>

320
00:18:55.651 --> 00:18:56.484
<v Speaker 1>in this video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's your impression of Dutch and </v>

321
00:18:57.781 --> 00:18:59.880
<v Speaker 1>German?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do they seem very similar to you?</v>

322
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.160
<v Speaker 1>Be sure to follow Lang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>focus on facebook,</v>

323
00:19:02.161 --> 00:19:04.290
<v Speaker 1>twitter and instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And once again,</v>

324
00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:06.570
<v Speaker 1>thank you to all of my patrion </v>
<v Speaker 1>supporters,</v>

325

328
00:19:14.731 --> 00:19:17.550
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for watching and have a nice </v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
