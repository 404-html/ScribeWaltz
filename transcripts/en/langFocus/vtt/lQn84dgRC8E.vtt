<v Speaker 1>Hey Mahmud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you help me read this Arabic message</v>

2
00:00:02.311 --> 00:00:04.650
<v Speaker 1>I got and I can't recognize any of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>words.</v>

3
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:07.050
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not Arabic.</v>

4
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.850
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Lange focus channel.</v>

5
00:00:11.851 --> 00:00:12.684
<v Speaker 1>My name is Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a recent video I talked about the </v>

6
00:00:14.821 --> 00:00:17.070
<v Speaker 1>Persian language which is spoken in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Iran,</v>

7
00:00:17.071 --> 00:00:17.904
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan and Tajikistan because Iran </v>
<v Speaker 1>is located in the Middle East next to </v>

8
00:00:21.571 --> 00:00:22.404
<v Speaker 1>Iraq.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people wonder if the Persian </v>

9
00:00:23.971 --> 00:00:24.804
<v Speaker 1>language and Arabic are related.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well they are not directly related but </v>

10
00:00:28.441 --> 00:00:29.274
<v Speaker 1>they have influenced each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Persian and Arabic belonged to </v>

11
00:00:31.831 --> 00:00:32.664
<v Speaker 1>completely different language families,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means that they have separate </v>

12
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.933
<v Speaker 1>origins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arabic is a Semitic language and it </v>

13
00:00:37.561 --> 00:00:40.200
<v Speaker 1>comes from the same root language as </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hebrew,</v>

14
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.850
<v Speaker 1>Aramaic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>phoenician,</v>

15
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.170
<v Speaker 1>go riddick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

16
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.930
<v Speaker 1>Persian on the other hand is an Indo </v>
<v Speaker 1>European language,</v>

17
00:00:45.931 --> 00:00:46.764
<v Speaker 1>the shares common roots with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages of northern India as well as </v>

18
00:00:49.741 --> 00:00:52.050
<v Speaker 1>most of the languages in Europe such as </v>
<v Speaker 1>English,</v>

19
00:00:52.051 --> 00:00:53.070
<v Speaker 1>French and German.</v>

20
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.083
<v Speaker 1>Therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Persian and Arabic have very different </v>

21
00:00:55.561 --> 00:00:58.440
<v Speaker 1>grammar and the way that words are </v>
<v Speaker 1>constructed is completely different.</v>

22
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.520
<v Speaker 1>Semitic languages have a unique system </v>
<v Speaker 1>of mostly three letter roots,</v>

23
00:01:02.521 --> 00:01:03.354
<v Speaker 1>and these three that are roots are put </v>
<v Speaker 1>into templates that form the shape of </v>

24
00:01:06.601 --> 00:01:08.070
<v Speaker 1>different words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

25
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.000
<v Speaker 1>the Arabic root for learn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which in English is like drs.</v>

26
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.800
<v Speaker 1>If you want to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I learn,</v>

27
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.190
<v Speaker 1>you take those three root letters and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you add them into this template here and</v>

28
00:01:17.191 --> 00:01:18.024
<v Speaker 1>say odd reus Persian does not have this </v>
<v Speaker 1>system of putting the root into </v>

29
00:01:22.561 --> 00:01:23.394
<v Speaker 1>templates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The root words stay in one piece and </v>

30
00:01:25.261 --> 00:01:26.094
<v Speaker 1>affixes are attached to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's look at an example in Persian </v>

31
00:01:29.251 --> 00:01:31.770
<v Speaker 1>using the root word done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means no,</v>

32
00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.190
<v Speaker 1>the first word is [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means to know.</v>

33
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.660
<v Speaker 1>So if we add the ethics Istan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that creates the infinitive of the verb.</v>

34
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.570
<v Speaker 1>The next word is dawn Nash,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means knowledge.</v>

35
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.630
<v Speaker 1>So the ethics ash creates an abstract </v>
<v Speaker 1>now than if we take that word and we add</v>

36
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.790
<v Speaker 1>another ethics at the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Donesh Monday,</v>

37
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.090
<v Speaker 1>that means scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that creates a concrete now.</v>

38
00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.830
<v Speaker 1>So you can see that nothing is changing </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the route where.</v>
