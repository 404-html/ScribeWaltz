1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.043
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I've had a lot of requests for a </v>

2
00:00:02.191 --> 00:00:03.024
<v Speaker 1>video on the North Germanic languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so today I present to you a video on </v>

3
00:00:06.631 --> 00:00:08.130
<v Speaker 1>Swedish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Norwegian,</v>

4
00:00:08.131 --> 00:00:09.660
<v Speaker 1>Danish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Finnish.</v>

5
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.913
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

6
00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:17.943
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and </v>

7
00:00:19.751 --> 00:00:20.584
<v Speaker 1>my name is Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today I'm going to talk about the north </v>

8
00:00:22.511 --> 00:00:23.344
<v Speaker 1>Germanic languages of the Nordic nations</v>
<v Speaker 1>that includes the Scandinavian </v>

9
00:00:26.741 --> 00:00:27.880
<v Speaker 1>languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Swedish,</v>

10
00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.260
<v Speaker 1>Danish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Norwegian,</v>

11
00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.530
<v Speaker 1>and I will also touch on the languages </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Icelandic and federal.</v>

12
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:33.373
<v Speaker 1>Always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to call this video at the </v>

13
00:00:34.661 --> 00:00:35.494
<v Speaker 1>Scandinavian languages because I just </v>
<v Speaker 1>love the way that word sounds </v>

14
00:00:38.021 --> 00:00:40.600
<v Speaker 1>Scandinavian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to the people of that region.</v>

15
00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.420
<v Speaker 1>The word Scandinavian only refers to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Denmark,</v>

16
00:00:43.421 --> 00:00:44.254
<v Speaker 1>Sweden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Norway and not to the other </v>

17
00:00:45.671 --> 00:00:49.510
<v Speaker 1>countries that I want to talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I say the Nordic nations,</v>

18
00:00:49.511 --> 00:00:53.110
<v Speaker 1>that also includes Iceland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Faroe Islands as well as Finland.</v>

19
00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:54.123
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk about the north Germanic </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages spoken in all of those </v>

20
00:00:56.681 --> 00:00:57.514
<v Speaker 1>countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I decided on the title that North </v>

21
00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.540
<v Speaker 1>Germanic languages of the Nordic </v>
<v Speaker 1>nations,</v>

22
00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.810
<v Speaker 1>and please note that finish is not in </v>
<v Speaker 1>north dramatic language.</v>

23
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.630
<v Speaker 1>It belongs to a separate language family</v>
<v Speaker 1>entirely.</v>

24
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.970
<v Speaker 1>There are about 20 million native </v>
<v Speaker 1>speakers of North Germanic languages and</v>

25
00:01:13.971 --> 00:01:16.790
<v Speaker 1>that includes about 9 million speakers </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Swedish,</v>

26
00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:17.773
<v Speaker 1>mainly in Sweden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also as a minority language in </v>

27
00:01:19.641 --> 00:01:22.070
<v Speaker 1>Finland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>6 million speakers of Danish,</v>

28
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.963
<v Speaker 1>mainly in Denmark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also as a minority language in the </v>

29
00:01:25.011 --> 00:01:28.400
<v Speaker 1>southern region of northern Germany and </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Greenland.</v>

30
00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.040
<v Speaker 1>5 million speakers of Norwegian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mainly in Norway.</v>

31
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.980
<v Speaker 1>Three hundred and 20,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>speakers of Icelandic,</v>

32
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.960
<v Speaker 1>mainly in Iceland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>90,000</v>

33
00:01:35.961 --> 00:01:38.810
<v Speaker 1>speakers a feral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're about two thirds of them living in</v>

34
00:01:38.811 --> 00:01:41.060
<v Speaker 1>the Faroe Islands and the rest of mainly</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Denmark.</v>

35
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.090
<v Speaker 1>The North Germanic languages are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you probably guessed,</v>

36
00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.370
<v Speaker 1>a branch of the Germanic language </v>
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>

37
00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.640
<v Speaker 1>All Germanic languages developed from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Provo Germanic,</v>

38
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:50.503
<v Speaker 1>which was spoken around 500 bce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>portage romantic possibly originated in </v>

39
00:01:54.441 --> 00:01:55.274
<v Speaker 1>Scandinavia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and different varieties of Germanic </v>

40
00:01:57.231 --> 00:01:58.064
<v Speaker 1>began to emerge with migration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Runic inscriptions from the second </v>

41
00:02:01.041 --> 00:02:01.874
<v Speaker 1>century ce show us that by that time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pro dramatic had began to separate into </v>

42
00:02:05.661 --> 00:02:08.540
<v Speaker 1>distinct western,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eastern and northern dialects.</v>

43
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:09.673
<v Speaker 1>The northern dialect was spoken in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Scandinavia and is today often referred </v>

44
00:02:12.621 --> 00:02:13.454
<v Speaker 1>to as pro tow norse and became the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ancestor of all the north Germanic </v>

45
00:02:16.911 --> 00:02:17.744
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Poteau northwest spoken from around the </v>

46
00:02:19.251 --> 00:02:20.084
<v Speaker 1>second century Ce to the eighth century </v>
<v Speaker 1>CE and by the beginning of the Viking </v>

47
00:02:23.871 --> 00:02:24.704
<v Speaker 1>era in the eighth century ce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it had evolved into dialects that are </v>

48
00:02:27.711 --> 00:02:32.060
<v Speaker 1>collectively referred to as old norse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>During the next few hundred years,</v>

49
00:02:32.061 --> 00:02:32.894
<v Speaker 1>vikings seafaring north people explored </v>
<v Speaker 1>much of Europe by sea and river </v>

50
00:02:36.291 --> 00:02:37.124
<v Speaker 1>conquering lands and establishing </v>
<v Speaker 1>settlements and bringing their language </v>

51
00:02:39.831 --> 00:02:41.540
<v Speaker 1>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>During this time,</v>

52
00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:42.403
<v Speaker 1>old north was divided into three </v>
<v Speaker 1>mutually intelligible dialects of old </v>

53
00:02:45.801 --> 00:02:46.490
<v Speaker 1>east,</v>
<v Speaker 1>north,</v>

54
00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.620
<v Speaker 1>old west,</v>
<v Speaker 1>north and old goodness.</v>

55
00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:49.783
<v Speaker 1>All the east,</v>
<v Speaker 1>northwest spoken in Sweden and Denmark </v>

56
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.690
<v Speaker 1>as well as their overseas settlements in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia,</v>

57
00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.150
<v Speaker 1>England,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in Danish settlements in Normandy,</v>

58
00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.000
<v Speaker 1>old West northwest spoken in Norway as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

59
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.003
<v Speaker 1>Its overseas settlements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the two most notable where Iceland and </v>

60
00:03:02.381 --> 00:03:04.540
<v Speaker 1>the Faroe Islands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also Ireland,</v>

61
00:03:04.541 --> 00:03:05.374
<v Speaker 1>Scotland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the isle of Man and Norwegian </v>

62
00:03:07.031 --> 00:03:08.070
<v Speaker 1>settlements in Normandy.</v>

63
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.050
<v Speaker 1>Old goodness was mainly spoken on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>island of Gotland,</v>

64
00:03:11.051 --> 00:03:14.920
<v Speaker 1>which is today part of Sweden as well as</v>
<v Speaker 1>some overseas settlements to the east.</v>

65
00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.250
<v Speaker 1>These west,</v>
<v Speaker 1>east and goodness varieties of old north</v>

66
00:03:18.251 --> 00:03:22.180
<v Speaker 1>gradually developed into the modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>north dramatic languages around the 14th</v>

67
00:03:22.181 --> 00:03:23.110
<v Speaker 1>century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ce,</v>

68
00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.110
<v Speaker 1>the Western branch of languages consists</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Norwegian,</v>

69
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:27.003
<v Speaker 1>Icelandic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and feral weeds as well as some other </v>

70
00:03:28.811 --> 00:03:29.644
<v Speaker 1>extinct languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The eastern branch consists of Swedish </v>

71
00:03:32.501 --> 00:03:35.260
<v Speaker 1>and Danish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The goodness branch consists of only the</v>

72
00:03:35.261 --> 00:03:38.860
<v Speaker 1>goodness language which is still spoken </v>
<v Speaker 1>to some extent on the island of Gotland,</v>

73
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.023
<v Speaker 1>but these days the north dramatic </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages are generally not thought of </v>

74
00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.260
<v Speaker 1>in terms of east,</v>
<v Speaker 1>west and goodness.</v>

75
00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.140
<v Speaker 1>They are thought of in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>continental and insular.</v>

76
00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.780
<v Speaker 1>The continental languages are Danish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Swedish,</v>

77
00:03:49.781 --> 00:03:50.614
<v Speaker 1>and Norwegian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the insular languages are Icelandic </v>

78
00:03:52.661 --> 00:03:53.494
<v Speaker 1>and Pharaoh always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These categories are based on mutual </v>

79
00:03:55.571 --> 00:03:56.404
<v Speaker 1>intelligibility of the languages rather </v>
<v Speaker 1>than on the genetic root language that </v>

80
00:03:59.681 --> 00:04:00.430
<v Speaker 1>they come from.</v>

81
00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.630
<v Speaker 1>Norwegian is grouped with Swedish and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Danish because even though Icelandic and</v>

82
00:04:04.631 --> 00:04:05.464
<v Speaker 1>Norwegian developed from the same old </v>
<v Speaker 1>west North's Norwegian is today much </v>

83
00:04:08.891 --> 00:04:11.050
<v Speaker 1>more intelligible with Swedish and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Danish.</v>

84
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.990
<v Speaker 1>One reason for that is the political </v>
<v Speaker 1>union of Denmark and Norway from 1536 to</v>

85
00:04:16.991 --> 00:04:18.820
<v Speaker 1>1814.</v>
<v Speaker 1>During this time,</v>

86
00:04:18.821 --> 00:04:19.654
<v Speaker 1>the written Norwegian language stopped </v>
<v Speaker 1>being used and it was replaced by the </v>

87
00:04:22.361 --> 00:04:23.194
<v Speaker 1>written Danish language and this had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>big impact on the spoken dialects of </v>

88
00:04:26.501 --> 00:04:27.334
<v Speaker 1>Norwegian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the central and eastern </v>

89
00:04:29.051 --> 00:04:31.990
<v Speaker 1>dialects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The continental languages also underwent</v>

90
00:04:31.991 --> 00:04:34.210
<v Speaker 1>a lot of influence from middle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>low German,</v>

91
00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.073
<v Speaker 1>which is an influence that didn't effect</v>
<v Speaker 1>Icelandic and always the three </v>

92
00:04:38.141 --> 00:04:42.040
<v Speaker 1>continental languages can be referred to</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the Scandinavian languages.</v>

93
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.320
<v Speaker 1>When talking about the Scandinavian </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages,</v>

94
00:04:44.321 --> 00:04:45.154
<v Speaker 1>it's important to note that there is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>significant amount of dialectal </v>

95
00:04:47.381 --> 00:04:50.140
<v Speaker 1>variation within each language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

96
00:04:50.141 --> 00:04:52.870
<v Speaker 1>the three languages are made up of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dialect continuum.</v>

97
00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.940
<v Speaker 1>That means if you travel in one </v>
<v Speaker 1>direction,</v>

98
00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.640
<v Speaker 1>the dialects gradually changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The further you go.</v>

99
00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:58.720
<v Speaker 1>That means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

100
00:04:58.721 --> 00:05:01.480
<v Speaker 1>that if you are Norwegian living near </v>
<v Speaker 1>the border with Sweden,</v>

101
00:05:01.481 --> 00:05:02.314
<v Speaker 1>you probably have an easier time </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding your neighbor just across </v>

102
00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:05.613
<v Speaker 1>the border and Sweden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you do a Norwegian from the other </v>

103
00:05:07.631 --> 00:05:08.464
<v Speaker 1>side of the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though you are supposedly speaking </v>

104
00:05:10.901 --> 00:05:12.760
<v Speaker 1>a different language from that Swedish </v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

105
00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:13.773
<v Speaker 1>This makes it kind of hard to determine </v>
<v Speaker 1>at what point these dialects become </v>

106
00:05:16.301 --> 00:05:19.420
<v Speaker 1>different languages or if they are in </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact different languages at all.</v>

107
00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:20.313
<v Speaker 1>The three languages are all more or less</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligible depending on where the </v>

108
00:05:23.111 --> 00:05:23.944
<v Speaker 1>dialect lies on that continuum and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>written languages are almost entirely </v>

109
00:05:27.281 --> 00:05:28.114
<v Speaker 1>intelligible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Danish seems to be the odd man out with </v>

110
00:05:30.341 --> 00:05:31.174
<v Speaker 1>its complex phonology that has come to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be quite distinct from the written </v>

111
00:05:34.001 --> 00:05:34.834
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Swedes and Norwegians often say that </v>

112
00:05:36.461 --> 00:05:39.610
<v Speaker 1>Danish people sound like they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking with a potato in their mouth.</v>

113
00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:43.000
<v Speaker 1>I can't actually confirm if they do </v>
<v Speaker 1>speak with a potato in their mouth,</v>

114
00:05:43.001 --> 00:05:43.834
<v Speaker 1>so scandinavians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you let me know if that's true in </v>

115
00:05:45.581 --> 00:05:47.740
<v Speaker 1>the comments down below,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have Danish roots,</v>

116
00:05:47.741 --> 00:05:50.230
<v Speaker 1>so I'm allowed to make fun of Dan's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From what I understand,</v>

117
00:05:50.231 --> 00:05:53.950
<v Speaker 1>Norwegians have the easiest time </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding the other two Scandinavian</v>

118
00:05:53.951 --> 00:05:54.784
<v Speaker 1>languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>though they understand Swedish better </v>

119
00:05:56.141 --> 00:05:56.974
<v Speaker 1>than Danish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Swedes can generally understand or we </v>

120
00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:00.023
<v Speaker 1>join,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they have much more trouble </v>

121
00:06:00.831 --> 00:06:03.290
<v Speaker 1>understanding Danish because of its </v>
<v Speaker 1>pronunciation,</v>

122
00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:04.573
<v Speaker 1>and Danes can more or less understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>Norwegian and to a lesser extent they </v>

123
00:06:07.551 --> 00:06:10.250
<v Speaker 1>can understand some Swedish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From what I understand,</v>

124
00:06:10.251 --> 00:06:13.640
<v Speaker 1>Scandinavians will generally not speak </v>
<v Speaker 1>the other person's language.</v>

125
00:06:13.641 --> 00:06:17.450
<v Speaker 1>They will speak their own language while</v>
<v Speaker 1>making an effort to understand the other</v>

126
00:06:17.451 --> 00:06:21.500
<v Speaker 1>person's speech and maybe they will slow</v>
<v Speaker 1>down and clarify things when necessary,</v>

127
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:24.290
<v Speaker 1>but when they have significant trouble </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicating,</v>

128
00:06:24.291 --> 00:06:25.124
<v Speaker 1>they might switch to English,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which isn't that tough for them because </v>

129
00:06:27.471 --> 00:06:30.800
<v Speaker 1>Scandinavians are magical geniuses when </v>
<v Speaker 1>it comes to learning English.</v>

130
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:31.783
<v Speaker 1>In this kind of situation where you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>three closely related languages that </v>

131
00:06:34.491 --> 00:06:35.324
<v Speaker 1>kind of blended together on a continuum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the languages are not defined by the </v>

132
00:06:38.391 --> 00:06:39.224
<v Speaker 1>spoken variety,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but rather by the official standard </v>

133
00:06:41.271 --> 00:06:43.820
<v Speaker 1>language associated with that country or</v>
<v Speaker 1>region.</v>

134
00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:44.863
<v Speaker 1>In Denmark there is standard Danish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Sweden there is standard Swedish and </v>

135
00:06:48.251 --> 00:06:50.990
<v Speaker 1>in Norway there is standard Norwegian or</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

136
00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:51.853
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are actually two standard </v>

137
00:06:52.761 --> 00:06:53.594
<v Speaker 1>Norwegians.</v>

138
00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:55.743
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Norway actually has two official </v>

139
00:06:57.221 --> 00:06:58.054
<v Speaker 1>standard written languages mall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means book language is a Danish </v>

140
00:07:03.391 --> 00:07:06.900
<v Speaker 1>influenced standard language which is </v>
<v Speaker 1>very close to standard Danish,</v>

141
00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:10.560
<v Speaker 1>but which uses Norwegian pronunciation </v>
<v Speaker 1>or new.</v>

142
00:07:10.561 --> 00:07:11.394
<v Speaker 1>Norwegian is intended to be a purer </v>
<v Speaker 1>version of Norwegian based on Norway's </v>

143
00:07:15.181 --> 00:07:17.100
<v Speaker 1>more conservative Western dialects,</v>

144
00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:20.220
<v Speaker 1>which standard language Norwegians are </v>
<v Speaker 1>educated in.</v>

145
00:07:20.221 --> 00:07:24.060
<v Speaker 1>Depends on the region they grow up in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but despite having two official standard</v>

146
00:07:24.061 --> 00:07:26.580
<v Speaker 1>languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Norwegians don't really speak them.</v>

147
00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:27.533
<v Speaker 1>Norwegians generally speak their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>local dialect whenever they are </v>

148
00:07:30.241 --> 00:07:31.074
<v Speaker 1>speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even in formal situations and even when </v>

149
00:07:32.821 --> 00:07:33.654
<v Speaker 1>they're speaking to people from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other Scandinavian countries because of </v>

150
00:07:36.061 --> 00:07:36.894
<v Speaker 1>this Norwegians have to get used to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding a wide variety of spoken </v>

151
00:07:39.961 --> 00:07:40.794
<v Speaker 1>dialects and that's probably part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what makes it easier for them to </v>

152
00:07:42.901 --> 00:07:43.734
<v Speaker 1>understand Swedish and Danish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that of course is just my </v>

153
00:07:46.021 --> 00:07:47.670
<v Speaker 1>speculation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So native speakers,</v>

154
00:07:47.671 --> 00:07:48.504
<v Speaker 1>you can confirm or disconfirm that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's take a look at the three </v>

155
00:07:51.301 --> 00:07:54.180
<v Speaker 1>continental languages and see just how </v>
<v Speaker 1>similar they are</v>

156
00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:57.120
<v Speaker 3>in English.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love you first and Swedish</v>

157
00:07:58.740 --> 00:07:59.720
<v Speaker 4>got bang</v>

158
00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:05.190
<v Speaker 3>now in Norwegian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now in Danish it was good.</v>

159
00:08:05.221 --> 00:08:05.770
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

160
00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:07.840
<v Speaker 1>as you can see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these sentences are very similar,</v>

161
00:08:07.841 --> 00:08:11.050
<v Speaker 1>but with some differences in spelling </v>
<v Speaker 1>and pronunciation in particular,</v>

162
00:08:11.051 --> 00:08:11.884
<v Speaker 1>the Swedish pronunciation is a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>different from the other to listen to </v>

163
00:08:14.231 --> 00:08:15.380
<v Speaker 1>the first person singular</v>

164
00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:16.243
<v Speaker 3>pronoun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

165
00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:21.870
<v Speaker 3>yours at the end of the Swedish one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can hear a hard g sound.</v>

166
00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:23.083
<v Speaker 3>It's not always pronounced that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It depends on exactly where the speaker </v>

167
00:08:25.161 --> 00:08:27.560
<v Speaker 3>is from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Another example,</v>

168
00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:30.500
<v Speaker 3>dogs are the best pets first and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Swedish.</v>

169
00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:32.550
<v Speaker 4>Who's the best</v>

170
00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:38.800
<v Speaker 3>next in Norwegian?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who knows the best to share with you and</v>

171
00:08:38.801 --> 00:08:41.290
<v Speaker 3>in Danish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who knew a diversity?</v>

172
00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:42.233
<v Speaker 3>Kayla,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you.</v>

173
00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:43.553
<v Speaker 1>Here we see some more noticeable </v>
<v Speaker 1>differences even though the sentences </v>

174
00:08:45.691 --> 00:08:46.524
<v Speaker 1>are still really similar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Notice the difference in the world for </v>

175
00:08:48.241 --> 00:08:49.074
<v Speaker 1>dogs</v>

176
00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:53.120
<v Speaker 3>who knew,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who knew the Swedish word is pretty much</v>

177
00:08:53.121 --> 00:08:55.970
<v Speaker 3>pronounced as written,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in the Norwegian and Danish words,</v>

178
00:08:55.971 --> 00:08:59.520
<v Speaker 3>some letters are not pronounced and </v>
<v Speaker 3>notice the different words for pets.</v>

179
00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:04.853
<v Speaker 3>The Swedish word is different from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>other two and the Norwegian and Danish </v>

180
00:09:07.411 --> 00:09:08.244
<v Speaker 3>words are almost the same,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but with a different initial sound and </v>

181
00:09:10.501 --> 00:09:12.960
<v Speaker 3>slightly different vowels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Another example,</v>

182
00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:15.390
<v Speaker 3>tomorrow I will go to Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In Swedish</v>

183
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.290
<v Speaker 4>your computer</v>

184
00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:19.653
<v Speaker 3>and in Norwegian you mourn Scalia Club </v>
<v Speaker 3>and in Danish you mourn scaleio to </v>

185
00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:26.230
<v Speaker 3>Scotland.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In this case,</v>

186
00:09:26.231 --> 00:09:28.810
<v Speaker 3>the Norwegian and Danish sentences are </v>
<v Speaker 3>basically the same,</v>

187
00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:31.270
<v Speaker 3>but the sweetest sentences pronounced a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little differently.</v>

188
00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:33.490
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we hear those hard g sounds which aren't</v>

189
00:09:33.491 --> 00:09:35.560
<v Speaker 3>present in the Norwegian and Danish </v>
<v Speaker 3>sentences,</v>

190
00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:37.450
<v Speaker 3>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not always pronounced in Swedish</v>

191
00:09:37.451 --> 00:09:40.060
<v Speaker 3>either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One more example in English,</v>

192
00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:43.510
<v Speaker 3>the party was fun because I liked the </v>
<v Speaker 3>music first in Swedish,</v>

193
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:45.760
<v Speaker 4>that's pretty young</v>

194
00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:52.090
<v Speaker 3>than in Norwegian for the elite and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>Danish first show for de Kooning Seton,</v>

195
00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:00.620
<v Speaker 3>and these sentences,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that preferred word for fun is different</v>

196
00:10:00.621 --> 00:10:05.621
<v Speaker 3>in each language.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the word meaning because there's also</v>

197
00:10:05.841 --> 00:10:08.360
<v Speaker 3>different in Swedish and Norwegian and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Danish.</v>

198
00:10:08.361 --> 00:10:09.194
<v Speaker 3>It's spelled the same but pronounced </v>
<v Speaker 3>differently and light is expressed </v>

199
00:10:15.051 --> 00:10:20.030
<v Speaker 3>differently in all three languages or </v>
<v Speaker 3>the ladder with the hard g sound,</v>

200
00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:24.590
<v Speaker 3>more like the voice in the recording who</v>
<v Speaker 3>newly in Danish.</v>

201
00:10:24.591 --> 00:10:26.750
<v Speaker 3>It's expressed in two words.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The first one,</v>

202
00:10:26.751 --> 00:10:27.584
<v Speaker 3>meaning could the phrase literally means</v>
<v Speaker 3>could suffer and listen to the </v>

203
00:10:31.011 --> 00:10:33.740
<v Speaker 3>difference for the word for music in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Norwegian and Danish.</v>

204
00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:36.140
<v Speaker 3>Listen to how the case sound disappears </v>
<v Speaker 3>in Danish.</v>

205
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:37.303
<v Speaker 3>And the second was Seton.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And listen to the pronunciation of this </v>

206
00:10:40.251 --> 00:10:41.410
<v Speaker 3>phrase again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

207
00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:44.420
<v Speaker 3>so the end of the second word seems to </v>
<v Speaker 3>vanish.</v>

208
00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:47.330
<v Speaker 3>This could be part of that potato </v>
<v Speaker 3>phenomenon discussed earlier.</v>

209
00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:48.733
<v Speaker 1>You can probably see just how similar </v>
<v Speaker 1>these three languages are and you can </v>

210
00:10:51.171 --> 00:10:52.004
<v Speaker 1>probably see how relatively speaking </v>
<v Speaker 1>they are easy for English speakers to </v>

211
00:10:55.131 --> 00:10:55.964
<v Speaker 1>learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are all category one languages </v>

212
00:10:57.651 --> 00:11:00.140
<v Speaker 1>according to the American Foreign </v>
<v Speaker 1>Service Institute,</v>

213
00:11:00.141 --> 00:11:02.900
<v Speaker 1>which trains diplomats for their </v>
<v Speaker 1>overseas assignments.</v>

214
00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:06.800
<v Speaker 1>None of the North Germanic languages are</v>
<v Speaker 1>amongst the most widely spoken languages</v>

215
00:11:06.801 --> 00:11:07.634
<v Speaker 1>in the world and people from the Nordic </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries generally speak excellent </v>

216
00:11:10.671 --> 00:11:11.504
<v Speaker 1>English.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So is it a waste of time to learn a </v>

217
00:11:12.811 --> 00:11:14.840
<v Speaker 1>north dramatic language?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course not.</v>

218
00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:17.930
<v Speaker 1>If you're interested in the cultures and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the history of that region,</v>

219
00:11:17.931 --> 00:11:18.764
<v Speaker 1>then learning one of the languages could</v>
<v Speaker 1>bring you immense joy and because the </v>

220
00:11:21.561 --> 00:11:24.020
<v Speaker 1>three Scandinavian languages are so </v>
<v Speaker 1>similar,</v>

221
00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:26.810
<v Speaker 1>learning one of them can unlock the </v>
<v Speaker 1>doors to the other ones,</v>

222
00:11:26.811 --> 00:11:27.644
<v Speaker 1>especially of the written languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you're an avid traveler or you </v>

223
00:11:30.441 --> 00:11:31.274
<v Speaker 1>want to go backpacking around the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you will probably meet in a </v>

224
00:11:33.411 --> 00:11:34.244
<v Speaker 1>surprising number of Scandinavians and </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing their language or even one of </v>

225
00:11:37.011 --> 00:11:37.844
<v Speaker 1>the other two languages will help you </v>
<v Speaker 1>break the ice and get to know some </v>

226
00:11:40.311 --> 00:11:43.010
<v Speaker 1>wonderful and possibly highly attractive</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

227
00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:45.650
<v Speaker 1>And if you are interested in the old </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nordic cultures,</v>

228
00:11:45.651 --> 00:11:47.840
<v Speaker 1>then you might benefit from learning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Icelandic.</v>

229
00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:51.260
<v Speaker 1>Since written Icelandic is still very </v>
<v Speaker 1>similar to old norse,</v>

230
00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:54.490
<v Speaker 1>so don't hesitate to start learning of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the North Germanic languages,</v>

231
00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:57.670
<v Speaker 1>which could be your portal into a whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>new world.</v>

232
00:11:57.730 --> 00:11:58.563
<v Speaker 1>So the question of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>native speakers of North Germanic </v>

233
00:12:00.791 --> 00:12:01.624
<v Speaker 1>languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is your experience communicating </v>

234
