1
00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.530
<v Speaker 1>And No,</v>

2
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.440
<v Speaker 2>good afternoon everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a nice sunny Sunday afternoon,</v>

3
00:00:17.441 --> 00:00:20.350
<v Speaker 2>so I decided to get out of my house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get out of the apartment,</v>

4
00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:24.160
<v Speaker 2>come outside in the sun to the partner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my video here.</v>

5
00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:25.323
<v Speaker 2>So today I want to talk about one of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>more popular or talked about language </v>

6
00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.880
<v Speaker 2>programs or series of language programs </v>
<v Speaker 2>out there and it's called Michel Thomas.</v>

7
00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.250
<v Speaker 2>I've used to have the Michel Thomas </v>
<v Speaker 2>Programs.</v>

8
00:00:36.251 --> 00:00:39.520
<v Speaker 2>I've used Michelle Thomas French and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Michelle Thomas Arabic,</v>

9
00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.370
<v Speaker 2>which is Egyptian Arabic by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you wanted to know.</v>

10
00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.890
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm just going to give my review,</v>

11
00:00:44.891 --> 00:00:47.740
<v Speaker 2>my impression based on my experiences </v>
<v Speaker 2>with it.</v>

12
00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.170
<v Speaker 2>Now for each of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did the basic course,</v>

13
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.740
<v Speaker 2>the advanced course and the vocabulary </v>
<v Speaker 2>builder course.</v>

14
00:00:53.741 --> 00:00:56.740
<v Speaker 2>I've done all three for both of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>languages.</v>

15
00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:58.503
<v Speaker 2>The names are not really accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think any of the advanced ones </v>

16
00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.690
<v Speaker 2>are really advanced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's more like introductory part</v>

17
00:01:04.691 --> 00:01:05.524
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>introductory part two and more </v>

18
00:01:07.721 --> 00:01:08.980
<v Speaker 2>introductory vocabulary.</v>

19
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.980
<v Speaker 2>That's what I would rename them to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll get more into that later.</v>

20
00:01:11.981 --> 00:01:12.814
<v Speaker 2>But basically Michelle Thomas is an </v>
<v Speaker 2>accelerated learning program and </v>

21
00:01:18.311 --> 00:01:20.740
<v Speaker 2>accelerated learning style.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His,</v>

22
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.360
<v Speaker 2>his big thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Michelle Thomas,</v>

23
00:01:22.361 --> 00:01:25.720
<v Speaker 2>his big thing is an absence of stress </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're learning,</v>

24
00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.440
<v Speaker 2>there should be no stress and no feeling</v>
<v Speaker 2>of responsibility for your own learning.</v>

25
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:30.643
<v Speaker 2>The responsibility for your learning </v>
<v Speaker 2>rests with the teachers so you're </v>

26
00:01:33.641 --> 00:01:34.474
<v Speaker 2>supposed to feel very relaxed when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're learning and that puts you in a </v>

27
00:01:36.941 --> 00:01:39.760
<v Speaker 2>better state for learning efficient </v>
<v Speaker 2>route,</v>

28
00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:40.803
<v Speaker 2>which is something I agree with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried to use that in my teaching as </v>

29
00:01:43.091 --> 00:01:43.924
<v Speaker 2>much as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Try to make the students feel relaxed </v>

30
00:01:45.911 --> 00:01:50.170
<v Speaker 2>and feel that there's no pressure upon </v>
<v Speaker 2>them to learn something.</v>

31
00:01:50.171 --> 00:01:54.310
<v Speaker 2>They're not ready to learn all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's part of his methodology is the</v>

32
00:01:54.311 --> 00:01:55.144
<v Speaker 2>lack of the absence of stress in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>absence of responsibility and when he's </v>

33
00:01:59.741 --> 00:02:01.420
<v Speaker 2>teaching,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's kind of meditative.</v>

34
00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.420
<v Speaker 2>Like you can hear on the cds when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>listen to it.</v>

35
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.040
<v Speaker 2>Mr Thomas himself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

36
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.953
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's very relaxed and I think he is </v>

37
00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.913
<v Speaker 2>consciously meditating and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to relax the listener and the </v>

38
00:02:11.621 --> 00:02:13.630
<v Speaker 2>students.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's just something I noticed.</v>

39
00:02:13.631 --> 00:02:14.464
<v Speaker 2>I can't guarantee that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's what I feel when I listened </v>

40
00:02:17.231 --> 00:02:18.064
<v Speaker 2>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy himself is meditating when he's </v>

41
00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.450
<v Speaker 2>teaching the course that's supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>transfer to you,</v>

42
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.640
<v Speaker 2>the listener.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's that part.</v>

43
00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:25.743
<v Speaker 2>Another thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another element of the accelerated </v>

44
00:02:27.971 --> 00:02:28.804
<v Speaker 2>learning is that he teaches the language</v>
<v Speaker 2>in an order where everything that's </v>

45
00:02:32.231 --> 00:02:34.870
<v Speaker 2>taught is connected to what's taught </v>
<v Speaker 2>next.</v>

46
00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.660
<v Speaker 2>Everything is a building block is </v>
<v Speaker 2>teaching you a small piece.</v>

47
00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.690
<v Speaker 2>Then he teaches you another piece on top</v>
<v Speaker 2>of that and another piece,</v>

48
00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:41.733
<v Speaker 2>and then you're building progressively </v>
<v Speaker 2>more difficult sentences as he does </v>

49
00:02:44.741 --> 00:02:46.570
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the way he does it.</v>

50
00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:47.880
<v Speaker 2>It's just very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

51
00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.610
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just very easy to learn,</v>

52
00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:52.743
<v Speaker 2>easy to learn each piece,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he does a good job of connecting </v>

53
00:02:55.151 --> 00:02:55.984
<v Speaker 2>them and explaining them and using some </v>
<v Speaker 2>mnemonics to help you remember in that </v>

54
00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.883
<v Speaker 2>kind of thing.</v>

55
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.100
<v Speaker 2>It's also a very teacher centered </v>
<v Speaker 2>approach.</v>

56
00:03:03.101 --> 00:03:03.934
<v Speaker 2>So the teacher is always directly </v>
<v Speaker 2>engaged with you and telling you what </v>

57
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.110
<v Speaker 2>sentence to produce.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's no free practice,</v>

58
00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.910
<v Speaker 2>like basically current methodology of </v>
<v Speaker 2>language teaching is you,</v>

59
00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.880
<v Speaker 2>you teach the language and then you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>

60
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.833
<v Speaker 2>some exercises to practice the language </v>
<v Speaker 2>structures and after that there's some </v>

61
00:03:21.341 --> 00:03:22.174
<v Speaker 2>kind of free practice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like somebody will ask you a question </v>

62
00:03:24.581 --> 00:03:25.414
<v Speaker 2>and you have to respond freely from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>things you've learned without being </v>

63
00:03:28.481 --> 00:03:31.090
<v Speaker 2>prompted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>without being reminded what to say,</v>

64
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.880
<v Speaker 2>so at some stage you are producing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>language freely,</v>

65
00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.580
<v Speaker 2>but in the Michelle Thomas programs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's none of that.</v>

66
00:03:36.581 --> 00:03:37.414
<v Speaker 2>It's all controlled practice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means that you're learning a lot </v>

67
00:03:39.611 --> 00:03:40.444
<v Speaker 2>of structures kind of quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're not given the opportunity to </v>

68
00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.963
<v Speaker 2>produce them freely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I think of it is the way he set it </v>

69
00:03:49.061 --> 00:03:52.660
<v Speaker 2>up as like a very sheltered environment </v>
<v Speaker 2>for learning that language.</v>

70
00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.310
<v Speaker 2>If you're not supposed to do any </v>
<v Speaker 2>homework,</v>

71
00:03:54.311 --> 00:03:57.220
<v Speaker 2>you're not supposed to use any other </v>
<v Speaker 2>materials.</v>

72
00:03:57.221 --> 00:04:00.790
<v Speaker 2>You're only supposed to rely on him for </v>
<v Speaker 2>all of the learning.</v>

73
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.153
<v Speaker 2>So the positives of this accelerated </v>
<v Speaker 2>learning method are that you feel very </v>

74
00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:08.673
<v Speaker 2>encouraged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You feel very encouraged and motivated </v>

75
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.170
<v Speaker 2>because it's set up in a way that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>never feel that you're failing.</v>

76
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.800
<v Speaker 2>You always feel like you've succeeded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not allowed to fail in the method</v>

77
00:04:17.801 --> 00:04:19.210
<v Speaker 2>really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you make a mistake,</v>

78
00:04:19.211 --> 00:04:22.660
<v Speaker 2>he corrects you right on the spot and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're supposed to fix it immediately.</v>

79
00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.220
<v Speaker 2>So you always finish every moment of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>lesson feeling successful,</v>

80
00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.550
<v Speaker 2>so that's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's meant to encourage you and meant to</v>

81
00:04:30.551 --> 00:04:35.530
<v Speaker 2>keep you in that ideal learning state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is good for what it is,</v>

82
00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:41.050
<v Speaker 2>but it can be negative and in a way part</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the feeling of that,</v>

83
00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.893
<v Speaker 2>the feeling constantly encouraged to </v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling nothing but success all the </v>

84
00:04:45.431 --> 00:04:46.000
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

85
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.833
<v Speaker 2>It makes people sometimes feel kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>invincible and it makes them delude </v>

86
00:04:50.621 --> 00:04:51.454
<v Speaker 2>themselves into thinking that they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>really good at the language when </v>

87
00:04:53.921 --> 00:04:56.560
<v Speaker 2>actually they're still a really low </v>
<v Speaker 2>beginners.</v>

88
00:04:56.561 --> 00:05:00.130
<v Speaker 2>So that's kind of part of the danger of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Michelle Thomas method.</v>

89
00:05:00.131 --> 00:05:00.964
<v Speaker 2>You can go online and you can read some </v>
<v Speaker 2>people's reviews of the method and you </v>

90
00:05:03.851 --> 00:05:05.740
<v Speaker 2>look on Amazon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people are saying,</v>

91
00:05:05.741 --> 00:05:06.574
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm fluent after five hours and things </v>

92
00:05:08.621 --> 00:05:09.454
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you think,</v>

93
00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:10.151
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not.</v>

94
00:05:10.151 --> 00:05:11.610
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just a,</v>

95
00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.730
<v Speaker 2>a kind of self delusion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I guess just people get,</v>

96
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:17.110
<v Speaker 2>what's the word?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

97
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.033
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of euphoria I would say from </v>
<v Speaker 2>just that feeling of success makes </v>

98
00:05:21.491 --> 00:05:22.324
<v Speaker 2>people really excited.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's good if you are thinking of </v>

99
00:05:25.181 --> 00:05:27.190
<v Speaker 2>it realistically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you know from the start,</v>

100
00:05:27.191 --> 00:05:29.110
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is an introductory course.</v>

101
00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't expect to be fluent from this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that's impossible.</v>

102
00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.290
<v Speaker 2>If you have that realistic attitude in </v>
<v Speaker 2>mind,</v>

103
00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:36.423
<v Speaker 2>then that sense of euphoria is good </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it motivates you to keep </v>

104
00:05:39.251 --> 00:05:43.900
<v Speaker 2>studying and to to get some more </v>
<v Speaker 2>materials and keep going with it so it's</v>

105
00:05:43.901 --> 00:05:44.734
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just don't fall into that trap of </v>

106
00:05:45.971 --> 00:05:46.804
<v Speaker 2>thinking you know more than you do </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the danger of learning in that </v>

107
00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:53.470
<v Speaker 2>really sheltered environment where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>feel nothing but success,</v>

108
00:05:53.471 --> 00:05:56.770
<v Speaker 2>nothing but relaxed kind of confidence </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the language.</v>

109
00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:57.793
<v Speaker 2>When you get outside of that into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>real world and you try to communicate </v>

110
00:06:00.321 --> 00:06:01.154
<v Speaker 2>with a native speaker and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand anything and you can't </v>

111
00:06:03.831 --> 00:06:04.664
<v Speaker 2>remember how to make a sentence and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't remember the vocabulary you </v>

112
00:06:07.491 --> 00:06:10.040
<v Speaker 2>learned in that Michelle Thomas </v>
<v Speaker 2>sheltered box,</v>

113
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.030
<v Speaker 2>then you're going to feel discouraged,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

114
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:15.440
<v Speaker 2>If you're not expecting that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's.</v>

115
00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:19.460
<v Speaker 2>That's like I mentioned before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't get any experience interacting</v>

116
00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.830
<v Speaker 2>in the Michelle Thomas Program.</v>

117
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:26.390
<v Speaker 2>You don't learn how to respond to </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything that is said unexpectedly.</v>

118
00:06:26.391 --> 00:06:28.490
<v Speaker 2>You don't learn how to accomplish a </v>
<v Speaker 2>task.</v>

119
00:06:28.491 --> 00:06:32.000
<v Speaker 2>You don't learn how to paraphrase or say</v>
<v Speaker 2>things you don't know how to say yet.</v>

120
00:06:32.001 --> 00:06:34.940
<v Speaker 2>It's always just you say something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You already know how to say.</v>

121
00:06:34.941 --> 00:06:35.774
<v Speaker 2>You say exactly what the teacher tells </v>
<v Speaker 2>you to controlled for you to be able to </v>

122
00:06:38.931 --> 00:06:39.764
<v Speaker 2>transfer that into conversations with </v>
<v Speaker 2>native speakers so it it's good for </v>

123
00:06:44.031 --> 00:06:44.864
<v Speaker 2>getting one very basic thing down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the sentence structure of the </v>

124
00:06:47.931 --> 00:06:50.480
<v Speaker 2>language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get the sentence structure and basic</v>

125
00:06:50.481 --> 00:06:51.314
<v Speaker 2>vocabulary so you can make sentences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the harder part of becoming </v>

126
00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:00.200
<v Speaker 2>proficient in a language is interaction </v>
<v Speaker 2>and communication.</v>

127
00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:02.360
<v Speaker 2>Unless you just want to type some </v>
<v Speaker 2>sentences,</v>

128
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:05.780
<v Speaker 2>unless you just want to write sentences </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you as an exercise,</v>

129
00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:06.913
<v Speaker 2>then you need to interact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the part that's really the </v>

130
00:07:09.501 --> 00:07:10.334
<v Speaker 2>challenge and it could cause a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>discouragement if you are not prepared </v>

131
00:07:15.921 --> 00:07:16.754
<v Speaker 2>for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just focusing on the Michelle Thomas </v>

132
00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:21.830
<v Speaker 2>language style of learning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

133
00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.230
<v Speaker 2>so with all that said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Michel Thomas.</v>
