<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and </v>

2
00:00:03.161 --> 00:00:03.994
<v Speaker 1>my name is Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for watching and have a nice </v>

3
00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:12.120
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mickey,</v>

4
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:14.933
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you want?</v>

5
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.430
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean that's wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say that in every video.</v>

6
00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:25.160
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

7
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:32.370
<v Speaker 1>Cut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

8
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:33.203
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and </v>

9
00:00:35.281 --> 00:00:36.114
<v Speaker 1>my name is Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today's topic is why does Portuguese </v>

10
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.960
<v Speaker 1>sound like Russian?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

11
00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:43.363
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be quiet.</v>

12
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.600
<v Speaker 1>So why am I even asking that question?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

13
00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:47.443
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people hear Portuguese and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>usually the Portuguese spoken in </v>

14
00:00:50.331 --> 00:00:51.164
<v Speaker 1>Portugal rather than Brazil or elsewhere</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they think it sounds Russian or </v>

15
00:00:54.651 --> 00:00:57.560
<v Speaker 1>Slavic Russian being a slavic language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

16
00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.280
<v Speaker 1>most of the people who say this are </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who don't speak either language,</v>

17
00:01:01.281 --> 00:01:04.940
<v Speaker 1>but just think that something about </v>
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese sounds Russian without really</v>

18
00:01:04.941 --> 00:01:05.774
<v Speaker 1>being able to describe why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm sure that a lot of Portuguese </v>

19
00:01:08.721 --> 00:01:11.630
<v Speaker 1>speakers and Russian speakers will say </v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's ridiculous.</v>

20
00:01:11.631 --> 00:01:12.464
<v Speaker 1>They sound nothing alike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've even heard native speakers of </v>

21
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.043
<v Speaker 1>Russian say that they think Portuguese </v>
<v Speaker 1>sounds Russian and I've heard native </v>

22
00:01:18.921 --> 00:01:23.090
<v Speaker 1>speakers of Polish as well say that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>think Portuguese sounds like Polish.</v>

23
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.290
<v Speaker 1>Let me be clear that they are not saying</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Portuguese is mutually intelligible</v>

24
00:01:27.291 --> 00:01:29.690
<v Speaker 1>with Russia or with any other Slavic </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

25
00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:30.613
<v Speaker 1>It's not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What they do say is that if they hear </v>

26
00:01:32.841 --> 00:01:33.674
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese being spoken at a distance </v>
<v Speaker 1>but they aren't close enough to hear </v>

27
00:01:36.351 --> 00:01:37.184
<v Speaker 1>what's being said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or if they're not really paying </v>

28
00:01:38.481 --> 00:01:39.314
<v Speaker 1>attention to what's being said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they think it sounds like Russian </v>

29
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.660
<v Speaker 1>or Polish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've heard the same thing in reverse</v>

30
00:01:44.661 --> 00:01:45.494
<v Speaker 1>from European speakers of Portuguese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they hear Russian or another Slavic </v>

31
00:01:48.591 --> 00:01:49.424
<v Speaker 1>language from a distance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they might think that it sounds like </v>

32
00:01:51.171 --> 00:01:53.240
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so how can that happen?</v>

33
00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.880
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because of some similar elements in</v>

34
00:01:55.881 --> 00:01:56.714
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Phonology,</v>

35
00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.670
<v Speaker 1>stress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>timed languages.</v>

36
00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:59.593
<v Speaker 1>One important similarity between </v>
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese and Russian is that both of </v>

37
00:02:02.631 --> 00:02:06.380
<v Speaker 1>them are stressed timed languages in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>stress timed language,</v>

38
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.333
<v Speaker 1>the length of time between stressed </v>
<v Speaker 1>syllables remains relatively consistent </v>

39
00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:13.490
<v Speaker 1>and in order to fit into that fixed time</v>
<v Speaker 1>interval,</v>

40
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.330
<v Speaker 1>unstressed syllables become compressed </v>
<v Speaker 1>and shortened.</v>

41
00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.100
<v Speaker 1>This results in a lot of vowel </v>
<v Speaker 1>reduction.</v>

42
00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.930
<v Speaker 1>European Portuguese contains quite an </v>
<v Speaker 1>extreme amount of vowel reduction.</v>

43
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.920
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>done form.</v>

44
00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.163
<v Speaker 1>This means I'm hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see that the sounds old is </v>

45
00:02:29.511 --> 00:02:34.511
<v Speaker 1>reduced or a Schwab and the sound is </v>
<v Speaker 1>reduced form.</v>

46
00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.940
<v Speaker 1>Another example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>important again,</v>

47
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:38.803
<v Speaker 1>the old is reduced and a is reduced to </v>
<v Speaker 1>or basically disappears important and </v>

48
00:02:45.561 --> 00:02:48.200
<v Speaker 1>there's similarly a lot of vowel </v>
<v Speaker 1>reduction in Russian.</v>

49
00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:49.690
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uber.</v>

50
00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.860
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this word means cloud.</v>

51
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.450
<v Speaker 1>The off is reduced to a Schwab and old </v>
<v Speaker 1>is also reduced to a Schwab.</v>

52
00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.530
<v Speaker 1>Another example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>subpart d,</v>

53
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.520
<v Speaker 1>this word means boots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've probably noticed the reduction in</v>

54
00:03:03.521 --> 00:03:05.500
<v Speaker 1>these two vowels right here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so buggy,</v>

55
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:06.753
<v Speaker 1>Russian and other Slavic languages also </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a lot of consonant clusters and </v>

56
00:03:10.151 --> 00:03:13.120
<v Speaker 1>because of the heavy vowel reduction in </v>
<v Speaker 1>European Portuguese,</v>

57
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.660
<v Speaker 1>it ends up having more consonant </v>
<v Speaker 1>clusters than other romance languages.</v>

58
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.160
<v Speaker 1>Here's a Portuguese example.</v>

59
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:20.523
<v Speaker 1>This means to despise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a consonant cluster with four </v>

60
00:03:23.411 --> 00:03:24.244
<v Speaker 1>consonants which results from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dropping of the evil app for consonants </v>

61
00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.660
<v Speaker 1>is an extreme example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and three is more common,</v>

62
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.700
<v Speaker 1>and here's a Russian example split.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means splash.</v>

63
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:37.653
<v Speaker 1>This cluster also has four consonants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>split risk in addition to the vowel </v>

64
00:03:42.101 --> 00:03:42.934
<v Speaker 1>reduction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stress timing results in a similar </v>

65
00:03:44.711 --> 00:03:45.544
<v Speaker 1>rhythm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a similar cadence in contrast with </v>

66
00:03:48.491 --> 00:03:49.324
<v Speaker 1>stress times languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are also syllable timed languages </v>

67
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.193
<v Speaker 1>in syllable timed languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Each syllable lasts for a more or less </v>

68
00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.823
<v Speaker 1>equal duration of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Other romance languages are much more </v>

69
00:03:59.501 --> 00:04:03.460
<v Speaker 1>syllable time to then Portuguese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which gives it its different cadence and</v>

70
00:04:03.461 --> 00:04:04.294
<v Speaker 1>it's vowel reduction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting to note that Brazilian </v>

71
00:04:06.461 --> 00:04:07.294
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has weaker stress timing than </v>

72
00:04:08.921 --> 00:04:09.754
<v Speaker 1>European.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese is often said to sound more </v>

73
00:04:11.651 --> 00:04:14.020
<v Speaker 1>like Spanish than European.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese does,</v>

74
00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.740
<v Speaker 1>but there are lots of stress timed </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages including English,</v>

75
00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:20.890
<v Speaker 1>and I don't hear anybody saying that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese sounds like English,</v>

76
00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.570
<v Speaker 1>so there must be more to it than that.</v>

77
00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.823
<v Speaker 1>Sibilance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One feature of Russian is that sibilant </v>

78
00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:27.123
<v Speaker 1>sounds are quite prominent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sibilance are continents that have a </v>

79
00:04:29.771 --> 00:04:33.070
<v Speaker 1>hissing or hushing sound as in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>English sibilants,</v>

80
00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.520
<v Speaker 1>SA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chef Joe,</v>

81
00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.050
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>

82
00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.730
<v Speaker 1>Russian features these sibilants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sa,</v>

83
00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.340
<v Speaker 1>Zap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chop shop,</v>

84
00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.013
<v Speaker 1>and Portuguese features.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These four sa Za Shock Jock Portuguese </v>

85
00:04:52.121 --> 00:04:52.954
<v Speaker 1>contains frequent sibilance and </v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically has an abundance of Palo </v>

86
00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.770
<v Speaker 1>Alto Alveolar sibilants show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is voiceless and Asia,</v>

87
00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.810
<v Speaker 1>which has voiced orthographic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>s and z are rendered as shook and joe in</v>

88
00:05:04.811 --> 00:05:08.680
<v Speaker 1>some contexts before a voiceless </v>
<v Speaker 1>consonant or before a pause.</v>

89
00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.380
<v Speaker 1>Sibilance are pronounced shift.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

90
00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:12.363
<v Speaker 1>see Dutch meaning cities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>las meaning happy in the plural form </v>

91
00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:18.040
<v Speaker 1>fresh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trish.</v>

92
00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.610
<v Speaker 1>This means makes three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll.</v>

93
00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:23.440
<v Speaker 1>This means they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this example,</v>

94
00:05:23.441 --> 00:05:28.270
<v Speaker 1>the s becomes at the end of the word and</v>
<v Speaker 1>also notice that the reduced vowel,</v>

95
00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.193
<v Speaker 1>a fully dropped vowel actually results </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a consonant cluster ending in ship </v>

96
00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:36.910
<v Speaker 1>before I voiced consonant Asia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

97
00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:39.273
<v Speaker 1>meaning fortunately it's also worth </v>
<v Speaker 1>noting that the letter j and also ge </v>

98
00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:47.230
<v Speaker 1>when it's pronounced as a soft g,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are also pronounced measure.</v>

99
00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:48.903
<v Speaker 1>These two Russian sibilance and she have</v>
<v Speaker 1>similar sounds to Portuguese shot and </v>

100
00:05:55.511 --> 00:05:59.510
<v Speaker 1>this Russian sibilant draw is similar to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese,</v>

101
00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:00.393
<v Speaker 1>just they're not exactly the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Portuguese ones are post Alveolar </v>

102
00:06:03.921 --> 00:06:04.754
<v Speaker 1>sibilants while these Russian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once our retroflex sibilance with a </v>

103
00:06:07.731 --> 00:06:09.680
<v Speaker 1>slightly different place of </v>
<v Speaker 1>articulation,</v>

104
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.830
<v Speaker 1>and this one here is an lv Leo Palatal </v>
<v Speaker 1>sibilant.</v>

105
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.100
<v Speaker 1>This sound is also slightly different </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the Portuguese one,</v>

106
00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:16.963
<v Speaker 1>but it sounds somewhat similar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least two people who don't use that </v>

107
00:06:19.191 --> 00:06:20.024
<v Speaker 1>sound natively a moment to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We saw a type of consonant assimilation </v>

108
00:06:23.901 --> 00:06:24.734
<v Speaker 1>in Portuguese that makes the sibilant </v>
<v Speaker 1>either voiced or voiceless depending on </v>

109
00:06:28.071 --> 00:06:28.904
<v Speaker 1>what follows in Russian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a similar type of assimilation </v>

110
00:06:32.421 --> 00:06:33.254
<v Speaker 1>for most consonants voiced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Consonants are pronounced as voiceless </v>

111
00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:37.093
<v Speaker 1>at the end of a word or before another </v>
<v Speaker 1>voiceless consonant and voiceless </v>

112
00:06:40.311 --> 00:06:43.590
<v Speaker 1>consonants are pronounced as voiced </v>
<v Speaker 1>before a voiced consonants,</v>

113
00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:46.880
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this word,</v>

114
00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:53.110
<v Speaker 1>becomes voiceless and is pronounced as </v>
<v Speaker 1>look in this word becomes voiceless,</v>

115
00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:00.400
<v Speaker 1>and as pronounced as to zone in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>word becomes voiced and as pronounced as</v>

116
00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:02.683
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the frequent voiceless sibilant ship </v>

117
00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:09.500
<v Speaker 1>at the end of words in Portuguese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well as the assimilation of sibilance</v>

118
00:07:09.501 --> 00:07:10.334
<v Speaker 1>to the following consonant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making them either voiceless or voiced </v>

119
00:07:13.371 --> 00:07:18.290
<v Speaker 1>measure might unconsciously remind us of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the similar but more generalized pattern</v>

120
00:07:18.291 --> 00:07:19.124
<v Speaker 1>in Russian.</v>

121
00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:23.600
<v Speaker 1>That same pattern is also a feature of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Polish and most other Slavic languages.</v>

122
00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:25.820
<v Speaker 1>With Ukrainian being a notable </v>
<v Speaker 1>exception,</v>

123
00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:27.913
<v Speaker 1>palatalized consonants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One prominent feature of Russian is a </v>

124
00:07:30.861 --> 00:07:34.430
<v Speaker 1>distinction between hard consonants and </v>
<v Speaker 1>soft consonants,</v>

125
00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:35.323
<v Speaker 1>which our palatalized they sound </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhat like the consonant with a yoke </v>

126
00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:41.840
<v Speaker 1>sound immediately following Portuguese </v>
<v Speaker 1>features too.</v>

127
00:07:41.841 --> 00:07:42.674
<v Speaker 1>Palatal consonants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The characters in h represent a palatal </v>

128
00:07:47.691 --> 00:07:49.160
<v Speaker 1>nasal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

129
00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:50.803
<v Speaker 1>which we saw before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A similar sound appears in Russian as </v>

130
00:07:53.601 --> 00:07:56.090
<v Speaker 1>one of the soft consonants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

131
00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:01.110
<v Speaker 1>who stand yet meaning eliminate and in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese the letters l,</v>

132
00:08:01.111 --> 00:08:04.880
<v Speaker 1>h stand for a palatal lateral </v>
<v Speaker 1>approximate,</v>

133
00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:07.550
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could our volume again,</v>

134
00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:10.250
<v Speaker 1>there's a soft consonant in Russian that</v>
<v Speaker 1>sounds similar.</v>

135
00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:11.533
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these two palatal consonants alone are </v>

136
00:08:15.351 --> 00:08:17.660
<v Speaker 1>not enough to make Portuguese sounds </v>
<v Speaker 1>Slavic.</v>

137
00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:21.170
<v Speaker 1>After all the sounds do appearance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some other romance languages too,</v>

138
00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:22.153
<v Speaker 1>but together with the other elements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is one thing that contributes to </v>

139
00:08:24.831 --> 00:08:27.110
<v Speaker 1>the overall slavic sound of Portuguese.</v>

140
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:28.903
<v Speaker 1>The dark l,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another phonetic feature that sounds </v>

141
00:08:31.311 --> 00:08:34.580
<v Speaker 1>Slavic is the villa rised,</v>
<v Speaker 1>l of European Portuguese.</v>

142
00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:39.130
<v Speaker 1>This is like the dark l sound at the end</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the word field.</v>

143
00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:40.093
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the standard elo sound in Russian is </v>

144
00:08:41.961 --> 00:08:45.200
<v Speaker 1>also a dark l like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's a Portuguese example.</v>

145
00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:50.440
<v Speaker 1>I'll meaning high in a tall meaning </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christmas and the Russian example,</v>

146
00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:55.950
<v Speaker 1>balut meaning to swim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Luke meaning bowl or onion,</v>

147
00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:57.263
<v Speaker 1>nasal vowels and diphthongs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned before that some people </v>

148
00:08:59.971 --> 00:09:00.804
<v Speaker 1>think that Portuguese sounds like Polish</v>
<v Speaker 1>Slavic language and all of the features </v>

149
00:09:04.651 --> 00:09:07.590
<v Speaker 1>that I mentioned about Russian also </v>
<v Speaker 1>applies to polish,</v>

150
00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:11.400
<v Speaker 1>but Polish has one other feature in </v>
<v Speaker 1>common with Portuguese that Russian does</v>

151
00:09:11.401 --> 00:09:14.580
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nasal vowels in old slavonic,</v>

152
00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:17.550
<v Speaker 1>there were nasal vowels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in modern Slavic languages,</v>

153
00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:20.820
<v Speaker 1>they have merged with oral vowels except</v>
<v Speaker 1>for in Polish.</v>

154
00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:25.320
<v Speaker 1>In Portuguese there are a number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>nasal vowels and nasal diphthongs,</v>

155
00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:27.600
<v Speaker 1>and in Polish there are two nasal </v>
<v Speaker 1>vowels.</v>

156
00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:28.643
<v Speaker 1>This letter is pronounced own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which sounds close to the Portuguese </v>

157
00:09:32.011 --> 00:09:35.280
<v Speaker 1>nasal diphthong own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's one more.</v>

158
00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:37.830
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the nasal e sound,</v>

159
00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:38.903
<v Speaker 1>because Polish nasal vowels consist of </v>
<v Speaker 1>an oral vowel followed by a nasal semi </v>

160
00:09:42.731 --> 00:09:43.564
<v Speaker 1>vowel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They sound somewhat like nasal </v>

161
00:09:44.761 --> 00:09:47.070
<v Speaker 1>diphthongs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of which Portuguese has several.</v>

162
00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:50.280
<v Speaker 1>Here's a Polish example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning snake,</v>

163
00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:53.460
<v Speaker 1>and here's a Portuguese example with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>similar nasal vowel.</v>

164
00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:57.860
<v Speaker 1>Here's another Polish example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning snakes,</v>

165
00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:59.570
<v Speaker 1>and here's a Portuguese example.</v>

166
00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:06.510
<v Speaker 1>So even though a Portuguese is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>closely related to Russian Polish or any</v>

167
00:10:06.511 --> 00:10:07.344
<v Speaker 1>other Slavic language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just belong to language families </v>

168
00:10:09.601 --> 00:10:12.030
<v Speaker 1>within the wider Indo European language </v>
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>

169
00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:12.933
<v Speaker 1>That's their only connection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do share a number of phonological </v>

170
00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:16.553
<v Speaker 1>features that make them sound </v>
<v Speaker 1>superficially similar to the untrained </v>

171
00:10:19.741 --> 00:10:20.574
<v Speaker 1>ear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially from a distance or when </v>

172
00:10:21.931 --> 00:10:24.120
<v Speaker 1>you're not paying attention to what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>being said.</v>

173
00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:27.120
<v Speaker 1>It's not really a big deal in the grand </v>
<v Speaker 1>scheme of things,</v>

174
00:10:27.121 --> 00:10:27.954
<v Speaker 1>but it raises an interesting question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are those features that stand out </v>

175
00:10:30.721 --> 00:10:34.920
<v Speaker 1>to us and make us think that they sound </v>
<v Speaker 1>similar largely on an unconscious level?</v>

176
00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:36.083
<v Speaker 1>The question of the day to speakers of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese and two speakers of Russian </v>

177
00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:40.463
<v Speaker 1>Polish and other Slavic languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever had the impression that </v>

178
00:10:42.691 --> 00:10:43.524
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese sounds Slavic?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What sounds are features might have </v>

179
00:10:45.841 --> 00:10:48.240
<v Speaker 1>given you that impression and to other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people?</v>

180
00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:51.600
<v Speaker 1>Does Portuguese sound Russian to you or </v>
<v Speaker 1>sounds Slavic to you?</v>

181
00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:55.110
<v Speaker 1>You may not consciously know what </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russian or slavic sounds like,</v>

182
00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:58.410
<v Speaker 1>but you probably associate them with </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain sounds unconsciously.</v>
