00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.490
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the lane focus channel.</v>

2
00:00:02.491 --> 00:00:04.650
<v Speaker 1>My name is Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for tuning in.</v>

3
00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:05.943
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When refining and improving your own </v>

4
00:00:07.801 --> 00:00:08.634
<v Speaker 1>approach to learning languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's always great to look at people who </v>

5
00:00:11.311 --> 00:00:12.144
<v Speaker 1>have done it before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People have already done it very </v>

6
00:00:13.921 --> 00:00:16.080
<v Speaker 1>successfully and model what they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>

7
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.380
<v Speaker 1>copy what they're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>copied their strategies for learning and</v>

8
00:00:19.381 --> 00:00:21.150
<v Speaker 1>their approach to learning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their attitudes,</v>

9
00:00:21.151 --> 00:00:21.984
<v Speaker 1>to learning all of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've met a lot of people who are great </v>

10
00:00:25.141 --> 00:00:25.974
<v Speaker 1>with languages while traveling and also </v>
<v Speaker 1>in my regular life and I'd like to talk </v>

11
00:00:29.671 --> 00:00:30.504
<v Speaker 1>about a couple of particularly </v>
<v Speaker 1>impressive people that we can learn </v>

12
00:00:32.731 --> 00:00:36.360
<v Speaker 1>something from now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This goes back to my first time visiting</v>

13
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.420
<v Speaker 1>Egypt in 1997.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in a backpack of resort called the</v>

14
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.273
<v Speaker 1>hub and I met a number of Bedouin girls </v>
<v Speaker 1>who were there just selling bracelets </v>

15
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.200
<v Speaker 1>that were selling little trinkets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>souvenirs to tourists like me.</v>

16
00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.830
<v Speaker 1>We would go and sit on the beach and </v>
<v Speaker 1>these little beach side restaurant,</v>

17
00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:53.703
<v Speaker 1>a cushions laid out on the beach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People would serve you food and these </v>

18
00:00:56.311 --> 00:00:57.144
<v Speaker 1>better when girls would just wander in </v>
<v Speaker 1>off the street and try to sell us </v>

19
00:00:59.341 --> 00:01:02.430
<v Speaker 1>bracelets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what was interesting was I sat there</v>

20
00:01:02.431 --> 00:01:03.264
<v Speaker 1>and I watched these girls switch between</v>
<v Speaker 1>multiple different languages in the </v>

21
00:01:06.061 --> 00:01:08.190
<v Speaker 1>space of like five minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would give them,</v>

22
00:01:08.191 --> 00:01:12.000
<v Speaker 1>speak English with lots of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they would switch to French without</v>

23
00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:14.160
<v Speaker 1>skipping a beat and then they would </v>
<v Speaker 1>switch to Spanish.</v>

24
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.500
<v Speaker 1>They would switch to Italian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would switch to Hebrew,</v>

25
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.930
<v Speaker 1>they would switch to numerous different </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>

26
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.853
<v Speaker 1>German,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

27
00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.770
<v Speaker 1>I think I even heard them speak Korean </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Japanese now.</v>

28
00:01:22.771 --> 00:01:25.020
<v Speaker 1>I was wondering how would these young </v>
<v Speaker 1>girls,</v>

29
00:01:25.021 --> 00:01:28.470
<v Speaker 1>like eight year old bedouin girls who </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably don't have much education,</v>

30
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.513
<v Speaker 1>how would they be able to speak eight </v>
<v Speaker 1>different languages or 10 different </v>

31
00:01:32.071 --> 00:01:33.420
<v Speaker 1>languages or whatever it was.</v>

32
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.553
<v Speaker 1>So that got me thinking about what makes</v>
<v Speaker 1>them successful and great with </v>

33
00:01:37.501 --> 00:01:39.360
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how do they do it?</v>

34
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.223
<v Speaker 1>How do these eight year old Bedouin </v>
<v Speaker 1>girls learn languages way better than </v>

35
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.780
<v Speaker 1>your average college student in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Western World?</v>

36
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.420
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there were three main areas that</v>

37
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.780
<v Speaker 1>I identified that we can learn from when</v>
<v Speaker 1>we look at these girls.</v>

38
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.020
<v Speaker 1>The first one is obviously their </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation,</v>

39
00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.990
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a strong economic incentive to</v>

40
00:01:57.991 --> 00:02:00.690
<v Speaker 1>learn that language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They come from a poor background.</v>

41
00:02:00.691 --> 00:02:03.600
<v Speaker 1>They live in a poor area or your only </v>
<v Speaker 1>source of income.</v>

42
00:02:03.601 --> 00:02:06.210
<v Speaker 1>Their source of their livelihood is </v>
<v Speaker 1>tourism.</v>

43
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.073
<v Speaker 1>They have to speak foreign languages in </v>
<v Speaker 1>order to get by and the more languages </v>

44
00:02:09.991 --> 00:02:10.824
<v Speaker 1>they can speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more potential customers they can </v>

45
00:02:12.511 --> 00:02:14.820
<v Speaker 1>communicate with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more money they bring up,</v>

46
00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.750
<v Speaker 1>so they have that economic incentive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of us living in the west,</v>

47
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.240
<v Speaker 1>we already have quite a cushy existence.</v>

48
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.130
<v Speaker 1>We can't quite imagine what it's like to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have that economic motivation to learn.</v>

49
00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.143
<v Speaker 1>One of the interesting things I've heard</v>
<v Speaker 1>about these young kids who are selling </v>

50
00:02:30.271 --> 00:02:34.020
<v Speaker 1>souvenirs is that they're not allowed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>go home to their house until they sell a</v>

51
00:02:34.021 --> 00:02:36.960
<v Speaker 1>certain amount of souvenirs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't go home and have dinner until</v>

52
00:02:36.961 --> 00:02:39.180
<v Speaker 1>they sell 20 bracelets or something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

53
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.410
<v Speaker 1>So imagine that they have that positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>incentive of making money,</v>

54
00:02:43.411 --> 00:02:44.244
<v Speaker 1>but they also have that negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>incentive of being punished basically </v>

55
00:02:47.221 --> 00:02:50.490
<v Speaker 1>for not selling enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that really motivates them to just do</v>

56
00:02:50.491 --> 00:02:52.260
<v Speaker 1>whatever it takes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

57
00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.070
<v Speaker 1>So they have no excuses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they make no excuses for themselves,</v>

58
00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.460
<v Speaker 1>they just go out and do it because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to.</v>

59
00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.120
<v Speaker 1>They really have choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they find whatever it takes,</v>

60
00:03:01.121 --> 00:03:03.730
<v Speaker 1>whatever resources they have inside </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves to learn.</v>

61
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.893
<v Speaker 1>Now that's quite different from your </v>
<v Speaker 1>average western person who whines and </v>

62
00:03:08.291 --> 00:03:10.540
<v Speaker 1>cries and says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't learn languages.</v>

63
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.490
<v Speaker 1>It's too hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes too much time.</v>

64
00:03:12.491 --> 00:03:15.820
<v Speaker 1>I have to study.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to watch TV instead of these kids</v>

65
00:03:15.821 --> 00:03:18.640
<v Speaker 1>actually go out and just do it because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have no choice.</v>

66
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.040
<v Speaker 1>And if you decide to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do that too.</v>

67
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.810
<v Speaker 1>So that's one thing we can learn from </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

68
00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.970
<v Speaker 1>It's not only these better when kids </v>
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>

69
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean in other developing countries </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been to.</v>

70
00:03:27.461 --> 00:03:29.590
<v Speaker 1>I've noticed the same thing when I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Cambodia,</v>

71
00:03:29.591 --> 00:03:31.870
<v Speaker 1>when I was in Indonesia when I was in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Thailand.</v>

72
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.540
<v Speaker 1>People who just have that economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>incentive,</v>

73
00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:35.403
<v Speaker 1>they don't have the same mental blocks </v>
<v Speaker 1>toward learning languages that people </v>

74
00:03:38.081 --> 00:03:40.780
<v Speaker 1>enrich countries do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just do whatever it takes.</v>

75
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.780
<v Speaker 1>They have that survival mentality and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they just go for it.</v>

76
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.913
<v Speaker 1>The second thing is that they're skilled</v>
<v Speaker 1>are based in practical experience right </v>

77
00:03:47.861 --> 00:03:48.694
<v Speaker 1>from the start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not sitting at home or sitting </v>

78
00:03:50.651 --> 00:03:51.484
<v Speaker 1>in a classroom getting kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>theoretical experience or simulated </v>

79
00:03:54.941 --> 00:03:55.600
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

80
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.433
<v Speaker 1>They're out there getting real </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience face to face with people </v>

81
00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:59.613
<v Speaker 1>using the language right from the start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's different from the way most </v>

82
00:04:02.561 --> 00:04:03.394
<v Speaker 1>of us learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We might learn from textbooks or in a </v>

83
00:04:04.781 --> 00:04:05.614
<v Speaker 1>classroom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're learning theoretically in a </v>

84
00:04:07.031 --> 00:04:07.864
<v Speaker 1>simulated sort of context and then later</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we have a certain level of the </v>

85
00:04:11.081 --> 00:04:11.914
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we go out and try to apply it with real </v>

86
00:04:13.331 --> 00:04:14.164
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of how most of us tend to </v>

87
00:04:15.671 --> 00:04:19.360
<v Speaker 1>learn languages or typical people in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>western languages,</v>

88
00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:20.283
<v Speaker 1>but these kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go out right from the start and </v>

89
00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:24.340
<v Speaker 1>they're getting that experience now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is that good?</v>

90
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:25.503
<v Speaker 1>If you're at home studying with a book </v>
<v Speaker 1>or you're in a classroom listening to </v>

91
00:04:28.481 --> 00:04:30.080
<v Speaker 1>your teacher and looking at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Whiteboard,</v>

92
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.530
<v Speaker 1>you're getting some sort of visual </v>
<v Speaker 1>input.</v>

93
00:04:32.531 --> 00:04:34.540
<v Speaker 1>You're getting some auditory input to </v>
<v Speaker 1>some extent.</v>

94
00:04:34.541 --> 00:04:35.374
<v Speaker 1>You're using those learning modalities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're not really getting as much </v>

95
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.033
<v Speaker 1>hands on kinesthetic experience of </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually using the language and feeling </v>

96
00:04:41.981 --> 00:04:42.814
<v Speaker 1>what it's like to use the language and </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you get out there in the real </v>

97
00:04:45.611 --> 00:04:47.080
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a real situation,</v>

98
00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:48.603
<v Speaker 1>it's very visually stimulating because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at an entire scene </v>

99
00:04:51.821 --> 00:04:52.450
<v Speaker 1>surrounding you.</v>

100
00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.370
<v Speaker 1>You're seeing different things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're seeing,</v>

101
00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.760
<v Speaker 1>you're hearing the real sounds of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>interaction that you have the real world</v>

102
00:04:57.761 --> 00:05:00.220
<v Speaker 1>around you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a simulated experience like you</v>

103
00:05:00.221 --> 00:05:03.190
<v Speaker 1>get with your textbook at home or in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>classroom.</v>

104
00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.233
<v Speaker 1>You're out there in the real world and </v>
<v Speaker 1>also you are getting the kinesthetic </v>

105
00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:07.743
<v Speaker 1>experience so you know what it feels </v>
<v Speaker 1>like to use the language and you get a </v>

106
00:05:10.481 --> 00:05:15.370
<v Speaker 1>certain emotional feeling when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>interact with that person and you also,</v>

107
00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:16.263
<v Speaker 1>you can feel physically what it's like </v>
<v Speaker 1>to use your body language and to </v>

108
00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.730
<v Speaker 1>actually physically interact with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>person you're communicating with.</v>

109
00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:22.793
<v Speaker 1>Now all of that creates a kind of a kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of memory and experience that includes </v>

110
00:05:27.401 --> 00:05:28.234
<v Speaker 1>all of those different learning </v>
<v Speaker 1>modalities and it's much easier to </v>

111
00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:36.010
<v Speaker 1>remember than when you're learning just </v>
<v Speaker 1>from a book or from the classroom.</v>

112
00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:40.390
<v Speaker 1>I can remember experiences that I had </v>
<v Speaker 1>using languages years and years ago.</v>

113
00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:45.640
<v Speaker 1>I remember I have a memory of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation 15 years ago in Jerusalem when</v>

114
00:05:45.641 --> 00:05:48.160
<v Speaker 1>I was there studying Hebrew and Hebrew </v>
<v Speaker 1>course.</v>

115
00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:50.860
<v Speaker 1>An acquaintance of mine came into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>room and he said,</v>

116
00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:51.953
<v Speaker 1>what most of the MTA when I was studying</v>
<v Speaker 1>and and that means you're not finished </v>

117
00:05:54.281 --> 00:05:55.630
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

118
00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:56.590
<v Speaker 1>Lord,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly empty.</v>

119
00:05:56.591 --> 00:05:57.620
<v Speaker 1>And they buy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means,</v>

120
00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:58.760
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not finished yet.</v>

121
00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:59.683
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the middle of studying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember that interaction and I </v>

122
00:06:02.481 --> 00:06:03.314
<v Speaker 1>remember the whole scene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can see that room and I can see him </v>

123
00:06:05.931 --> 00:06:06.764
<v Speaker 1>come into the room and I can hear the </v>
<v Speaker 1>intonation in his voice and I remember </v>

124
00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.380
<v Speaker 1>kind of feeling taken aback by it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way he said it.</v>

125
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:13.580
<v Speaker 1>It sounded like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

126
00:06:13.581 --> 00:06:15.230
<v Speaker 1>You're an idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not finished yet.</v>

127
00:06:15.231 --> 00:06:16.064
<v Speaker 1>It was that kind of intonation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I remember that whole feeling of the </v>

128
00:06:18.681 --> 00:06:21.290
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's the benefit of going out into</v>

129
00:06:21.291 --> 00:06:23.450
<v Speaker 1>the real world and really using the </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

130
00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.870
<v Speaker 1>You're encoding it into your physiology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

131
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:30.560
<v Speaker 1>It's a kinesthetic experience that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can recall as a memory.</v>

132
00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.290
<v Speaker 1>The memories are more powerful than </v>
<v Speaker 1>memorization.</v>

133
00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.210
<v Speaker 1>That's how I like to think of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

134
00:06:35.211 --> 00:06:36.044
<v Speaker 1>the third thing that these girls do well</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that their use of the language is </v>

135
00:06:38.961 --> 00:06:39.794
<v Speaker 1>very functional and it's goal oriented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not just learning the language </v>

136
00:06:43.131 --> 00:06:45.890
<v Speaker 1>for the sake of learning it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not just learning it so they can</v>

137
00:06:45.891 --> 00:06:46.581
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

138
00:06:46.581 --> 00:06:47.414
<v Speaker 1>I'm fluent in 10 languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not an ego based approach to </v>

139
00:06:49.941 --> 00:06:50.774
<v Speaker 1>learning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't feel like they have to learn </v>

140
00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:54.230
<v Speaker 1>absolutely everything about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

141
00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:56.540
<v Speaker 1>What is their goal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their goal is to sell.</v>

142
00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:57.703
<v Speaker 1>That's their main function or main point</v>
<v Speaker 1>for using that language and that's what </v>

143
00:07:00.891 --> 00:07:01.724
<v Speaker 1>they focus on when they're learning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So basically they want to sell to you </v>

144
00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:08.540
<v Speaker 1>and they're following a straight line </v>
<v Speaker 1>from meeting you to selling to you.</v>

145
00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:09.493
<v Speaker 1>The line ends when you buy something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of the language they learn is </v>

146
00:07:12.111 --> 00:07:12.944
<v Speaker 1>basically just language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They need to follow that straight line </v>

147
00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.153
<v Speaker 1>and they can veer off the line a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit and have a little bit of chatting </v>

148
00:07:18.801 --> 00:07:19.634
<v Speaker 1>time with you and they can ask some </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions about where you're from and </v>

149
00:07:22.611 --> 00:07:25.010
<v Speaker 1>they can talk to you about some casual </v>
<v Speaker 1>topics,</v>

150
00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:26.053
<v Speaker 1>but when they get too far off of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>line too far away from their focused </v>

151
00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:29.743
<v Speaker 1>goal of selling to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they probably aren't that good at </v>

152
00:07:31.941 --> 00:07:32.774
<v Speaker 1>communicating because that's not the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not where they focus their </v>

153
00:07:35.721 --> 00:07:36.554
<v Speaker 1>studying and focus their attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they'll always bring their attention </v>

154
00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:41.930
<v Speaker 1>back to that straight line of trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sell to you.</v>

155
00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:42.823
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all of their language is focused </v>

156
00:07:44.001 --> 00:07:44.834
<v Speaker 1>around that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's basically why they can speak </v>

157
00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:47.593
<v Speaker 1>10 different languages at such a young </v>
<v Speaker 1>age because they're not learning </v>

158
00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:52.700
<v Speaker 1>absolutely everything about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

159
00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:55.250
<v Speaker 1>They're learning the grammar and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure of the language basically.</v>

160
00:07:55.251 --> 00:07:57.590
<v Speaker 1>And they're learning the basic </v>
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary of language.</v>

161
00:07:57.591 --> 00:07:58.424
<v Speaker 1>Everything they need to sell to you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>to communicate with you and chat with </v>

162
00:08:01.251 --> 00:08:03.590
<v Speaker 1>you and build rapport with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that kind of thing,</v>

163
00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:04.693
<v Speaker 1>but if you start talking about widely </v>
<v Speaker 1>divergent subjects that have nothing to </v>

164
00:08:08.091 --> 00:08:08.924
<v Speaker 1>do with the sale and nothing to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting to know you well enough to make </v>

165
00:08:12.141 --> 00:08:12.974
<v Speaker 1>the sale happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they're not going to be that good </v>

166
00:08:14.361 --> 00:08:15.194
<v Speaker 1>with the language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So basically they're very focused on </v>

167
00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:17.803
<v Speaker 1>what they're using the language for and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have the basic structures of the </v>

168
00:08:20.301 --> 00:08:21.134
<v Speaker 1>language in place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if in the future if they needed to </v>

169
00:08:23.211 --> 00:08:24.044
<v Speaker 1>learn it for a different function,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can always add that extra </v>

170
00:08:25.851 --> 00:08:26.684
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>add those extra structures that they </v>

171
00:08:28.281 --> 00:08:29.114
<v Speaker 1>need on top of what they already know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they don't try to learn everything </v>

172
00:08:31.881 --> 00:08:32.240
<v Speaker 1>at once.</v>

173
00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.980
<v Speaker 1>They just learn what they need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

174
00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:35.203
<v Speaker 1>So in terms of your study,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about what you need to use the </v>

175
00:08:38.181 --> 00:08:39.014
<v Speaker 1>language for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You really need to learn absolutely </v>

176
00:08:41.631 --> 00:08:42.464
<v Speaker 1>everything about the language or do you </v>
<v Speaker 1>just want to use it for a specific </v>

177
00:08:44.961 --> 00:08:46.880
<v Speaker 1>purpose?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like getting to know friends,</v>

178
00:08:46.881 --> 00:08:49.580
<v Speaker 1>like making some friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being social in that language.</v>

179
00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:52.250
<v Speaker 1>Do you need to use it for a specific </v>
<v Speaker 1>business purpose?</v>

180
00:08:52.251 --> 00:08:53.990
<v Speaker 1>Do you need to write emails in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>language?</v>

181
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.033
<v Speaker 1>Whatever your purpose is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you should focus on that rather </v>

182
00:08:57.331 --> 00:09:00.540
<v Speaker 1>than trying to tackle the entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>language in one big goal.</v>

183
00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:01.883
<v Speaker 1>Now it's also worth pointing out that </v>
<v Speaker 1>these kids don't really worry about </v>

184
00:09:04.771 --> 00:09:05.604
<v Speaker 1>perfection at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of them speak with kind of funny </v>

185
00:09:08.011 --> 00:09:10.140
<v Speaker 1>grammar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't speak accurately,</v>

186
00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:12.330
<v Speaker 1>but they communicate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They understand you,</v>

187
00:09:12.331 --> 00:09:14.550
<v Speaker 1>you understand them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's all good.</v>

188
00:09:14.551 --> 00:09:16.980
<v Speaker 1>They can achieve that goal that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>have for the language.</v>

189
00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:18.203
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the benefit that has for learning is </v>

190
00:09:19.201 --> 00:09:20.034
<v Speaker 1>that you don't slow yourself down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't put yourself into a bit of a </v>

191
00:09:22.771 --> 00:09:25.920
<v Speaker 1>panic worrying about all the details and</v>
<v Speaker 1>worrying about perfection.</v>

192
00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:30.660
<v Speaker 1>Being a perfectionist can puts you in </v>
<v Speaker 1>into a non ideal learning state.</v>

193
00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:32.820
<v Speaker 1>It can make you stressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

194
00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:35.550
<v Speaker 1>Anxiety and stresses the antithesis of </v>
<v Speaker 1>learning.</v>

195
00:09:35.551 --> 00:09:38.070
<v Speaker 1>You want to avoid it like the plague,</v>
<v Speaker 1>always relaxed.</v>

196
00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:39.023
<v Speaker 1>You can continue improving your accuracy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and continue to self monitor and fix </v>

197
00:09:42.931 --> 00:09:46.200
<v Speaker 1>your your mistakes and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but don't worry about it.</v>

198
00:09:46.201 --> 00:09:47.034
<v Speaker 1>Just keep on learning and keep your goal</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your functions for the language in </v>

199
00:09:50.311 --> 00:09:51.144
<v Speaker 1>mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like these girls do and you'll </v>

200
00:09:52.201 --> 00:09:55.260
<v Speaker 1>learn a lot better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what can we learn from the eight year</v>

201
00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:56.670
<v Speaker 1>old Bedouin kid?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

202
00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:59.850
<v Speaker 1>number one is no whining,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no excuses,</v>

203
00:09:59.851 --> 00:10:03.270
<v Speaker 1>just go for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Find what motivates you and do it.</v>

204
00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:07.380
<v Speaker 1>Number two is get real experience from </v>
<v Speaker 1>as early on as possible.</v>

205
00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:10.430
<v Speaker 1>Don't do all your studying and simulated</v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences,</v>

206
00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:14.010
<v Speaker 1>simulated situations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't do all your studying with books.</v>

207
00:10:14.011 --> 00:10:16.890
<v Speaker 1>Get real experience with real people as </v>
<v Speaker 1>early as you can.</v>

208
00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:17.813
<v Speaker 1>And the third thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>know your main purpose for learning the </v>

209
00:10:19.861 --> 00:10:20.694
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you really need to know absolutely </v>

210
00:10:22.231 --> 00:10:23.064
<v Speaker 1>everything about the language?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you just want to make friends in the </v>

211
00:10:25.531 --> 00:10:26.364
<v Speaker 1>language?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to use it for a specific </v>

212
00:10:27.331 --> 00:10:28.164
<v Speaker 1>purpose?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Focus on your purpose for that language </v>

213
00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:32.400
<v Speaker 1>and put your attention there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then later in the future,</v>

214
00:10:32.401 --> 00:10:36.360
<v Speaker 1>if you need to add extra functions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>extra purposes for the language you can,</v>

215
00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:37.363
<v Speaker 1>but focus on what you need it for and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that will really accelerate your </v>

216
00:10:39.931 --> 00:10:40.764
<v Speaker 1>learning because you're not paying </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention to things you don't really </v>

217
00:10:42.721 --> 00:10:43.554
<v Speaker 1>need to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you ever think that you can't do </v>

218
00:10:45.781 --> 00:10:46.614
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can't learn a language that </v>

219
00:10:47.311 --> 00:10:49.650
<v Speaker 1>you're not good with languages or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

220
00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:53.410
<v Speaker 1>Just remember all those kids in </v>
<v Speaker 1>developing countries who learn languages</v>

221
00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:54.263
<v Speaker 1>quite well because they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just go for it and they have no </v>

222
00:10:56.911 --> 00:10:59.670
<v Speaker 1>mental block to learning it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if they can do it,</v>

223
00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:02.550
<v Speaker 1>you can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't even stress just to go for it.</v>

224
00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:03.541
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is Paul.</v>

225
00:11:03.541 --> 00:11:06.210
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for watching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have a good night and see ya.</v>

226
00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:10.510
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for tuning into laying focused</v>

227
00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:12.130
<v Speaker 1>TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am your host Paul,</v>

228

<v Speaker 1>you are getting in your way.</v>
