00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:01.343
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and </v>

2
00:00:03.151 --> 00:00:03.984
<v Speaker 1>my name is Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today I'm going to talk about language </v>

3
00:00:06.301 --> 00:00:10.980
<v Speaker 1>learning edge number five and that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>let go of your ego.</v>

4
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.320
<v Speaker 1>So what do I mean by ego?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5
00:00:13.321 --> 00:00:14.154
<v Speaker 1>by ego I mean that you have an image in </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind of the way you are and an image of </v>

6
00:00:17.821 --> 00:00:20.400
<v Speaker 1>the way that you want other people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>see you.</v>

7
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:21.713
<v Speaker 1>In order to be successful in language </v>
<v Speaker 1>learning and really to be successful at </v>

8
00:00:24.781 --> 00:00:25.614
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really important that you don't </v>

9
00:00:26.761 --> 00:00:29.550
<v Speaker 1>cling too tightly to your image of </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

10
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:30.863
<v Speaker 1>It's important that you realize that </v>
<v Speaker 1>your image of yourself may not </v>

11
00:00:33.661 --> 00:00:38.661
<v Speaker 1>completely be reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically,</v>

12
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.480
<v Speaker 1>you need to allow yourself to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable.</v>

13
00:00:41.481 --> 00:00:42.314
<v Speaker 1>You can't hide yourself from situations </v>
<v Speaker 1>that challenge your image of who you </v>

14
00:00:45.591 --> 00:00:46.424
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's human nature to always look for </v>

15
00:00:47.601 --> 00:00:50.120
<v Speaker 1>information that supports our image of </v>
<v Speaker 1>who we are.</v>

16
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.193
<v Speaker 1>But in order to grow as a person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to be flexible in that self </v>

17
00:00:54.171 --> 00:00:55.700
<v Speaker 1>image,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way you see yourself.</v>

18
00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.790
<v Speaker 1>Let me give you one example of how your </v>
<v Speaker 1>ego may trap you.</v>

19
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.833
<v Speaker 1>In this example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have convinced yourself that you </v>

20
00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:05.653
<v Speaker 1>suck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say that you've had a bad </v>

21
00:01:06.921 --> 00:01:09.080
<v Speaker 1>experience with language learning when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you were in school.</v>

22
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.973
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you had a bad teacher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe nobody taught you how to study at </v>

23
00:01:12.651 --> 00:01:14.220
<v Speaker 1>home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you were just a teenager,</v>

24
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.200
<v Speaker 1>preoccupied with teenagers stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you concluded that you were bad with</v>

25
00:01:18.201 --> 00:01:19.034
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You defined yourself as someone who was </v>

26
00:01:20.661 --> 00:01:21.494
<v Speaker 1>not good with languages because you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>defined yourself as someone who was bad </v>

27
00:01:25.101 --> 00:01:25.934
<v Speaker 1>with languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have probably ignored evidence that </v>

28
00:01:27.891 --> 00:01:29.090
<v Speaker 1>you can be good at them.</v>

29
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.880
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you started to get some success </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the language,</v>

30
00:01:35.881 --> 00:01:39.390
<v Speaker 1>but you gave up and you didn't know why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe you had some success,</v>

31
00:01:39.391 --> 00:01:40.224
<v Speaker 1>but you gave the thanks to some external</v>
<v Speaker 1>factor to someone else or something </v>

32
00:01:42.931 --> 00:01:45.240
<v Speaker 1>else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's success didn't motivate you.</v>

33
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.790
<v Speaker 1>Maybe every time you had a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>setback,</v>

34
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.100
<v Speaker 1>which everybody has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you thought to yourself,</v>

35
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.830
<v Speaker 1>of course I have a setback.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm bad with languages.</v>

36
00:01:52.831 --> 00:01:53.664
<v Speaker 1>This is my fault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that unconscious belief about </v>

37
00:01:55.921 --> 00:01:56.754
<v Speaker 1>yourself keeps you in a trance and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to snap out of it and see yourself </v>

38
00:02:00.301 --> 00:02:01.134
<v Speaker 1>more objectively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Recognize your successes and also know </v>

39
00:02:03.901 --> 00:02:08.010
<v Speaker 1>that all successful people encounter </v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of challenges and failures.</v>

40
00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.260
<v Speaker 1>Failures and successes did not define </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

41
00:02:10.261 --> 00:02:13.650
<v Speaker 1>They're just something that everybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>goes through while learning a skill.</v>

42
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.890
<v Speaker 1>So I want you to evaluate your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>beliefs about yourself.</v>

43
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.860
<v Speaker 1>If you define yourself as someone who </v>
<v Speaker 1>has bad with languages,</v>

44
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.580
<v Speaker 1>expelled that belief from your mind </v>
<v Speaker 1>expelled that idea from yourself.</v>

45
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.680
<v Speaker 1>Here's another example of how your ego </v>
<v Speaker 1>can trap you.</v>

46
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.633
<v Speaker 1>In this example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are trying to convince yourself and </v>

47
00:02:33.651 --> 00:02:36.350
<v Speaker 1>trying to convince other people that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>are amazing.</v>

48
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:37.303
<v Speaker 1>So let's say that you see yourself as </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who is great with languages or </v>

49
00:02:39.861 --> 00:02:40.694
<v Speaker 1>as someone who is great at everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're better than other people at most </v>

50
00:02:42.921 --> 00:02:43.754
<v Speaker 1>things he does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you present that image to other </v>

51
00:02:45.621 --> 00:02:47.300
<v Speaker 1>people like you want them to believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

52
00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.440
<v Speaker 1>well now you're trapped in that image as</v>
<v Speaker 1>being someone who's really good.</v>

53
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.830
<v Speaker 1>Now that might hurt your progress </v>
<v Speaker 1>because in order to improve,</v>

54
00:02:54.831 --> 00:02:57.710
<v Speaker 1>you have to take risks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to face failures,</v>

55
00:02:57.711 --> 00:02:58.544
<v Speaker 1>you have to overcome challenges,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you are scared to shatter that </v>

56
00:03:01.721 --> 00:03:02.554
<v Speaker 1>perfect image of yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're probably going to refrain </v>

57
00:03:04.811 --> 00:03:05.644
<v Speaker 1>from doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll shy away from all of those risky </v>

58
00:03:07.631 --> 00:03:08.464
<v Speaker 1>experiences because you want to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself and you want other people to </v>

59
00:03:11.081 --> 00:03:12.670
<v Speaker 1>see you as already perfect.</v>

60
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.620
<v Speaker 1>Taking risks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making mistakes,</v>

61
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.900
<v Speaker 1>overcoming failure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dealing with embarrassment.</v>

62
00:03:16.901 --> 00:03:19.810
<v Speaker 1>That is all part of the learning process</v>
<v Speaker 1>for everyone,</v>

63
00:03:19.811 --> 00:03:22.330
<v Speaker 1>and if you try to skip that part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>learning process,</v>

64
00:03:22.331 --> 00:03:23.164
<v Speaker 1>you will not be successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You may have noticed that I never </v>

65
00:03:25.361 --> 00:03:28.300
<v Speaker 1>referred to myself as a polyglot and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a reason for that.</v>

66
00:03:28.301 --> 00:03:30.250
<v Speaker 1>It's because I think that using that </v>
<v Speaker 1>word,</v>

67
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.980
<v Speaker 1>this is just me personally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not judging anyone else,</v>

68
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.023
<v Speaker 1>but when I use that word for myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like that's creating an ego that </v>

69
00:03:37.271 --> 00:03:41.350
<v Speaker 1>I have to be attached to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe if I call myself a polyglot than I</v>

70
00:03:41.351 --> 00:03:43.900
<v Speaker 1>will be scared to speak a language in </v>
<v Speaker 1>front of other people.</v>

71
00:03:43.901 --> 00:03:44.734
<v Speaker 1>If I'm not fluent in it yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'll be worried that I'm being </v>

72
00:03:46.931 --> 00:03:50.050
<v Speaker 1>judged for my language skills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'll want to speak less.</v>

73
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.063
<v Speaker 1>I tried to avoid that kind of go a trap </v>
<v Speaker 1>by not defining myself in terms of my </v>

74
00:03:54.461 --> 00:03:55.294
<v Speaker 1>results.</v>

75
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a polyglot or I'm not someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>who is amazing with languages.</v>

76
00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm just someone who loves languages and</v>
<v Speaker 1>loves the learning process.</v>

77
00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.513
<v Speaker 1>So in order to free yourself from any </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of self sabotage when it comes to </v>

78
00:04:06.581 --> 00:04:07.414
<v Speaker 1>learning languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I recommend that you take a look at the </v>

79
00:04:09.311 --> 00:04:11.710
<v Speaker 1>way you define yourself in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>

80
00:04:11.711 --> 00:04:15.790
<v Speaker 1>learning your story about yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make sure that your story doesn't define</v>

81
00:04:15.791 --> 00:04:17.740
<v Speaker 1>you as someone who was bad with </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages,</v>

82
00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.800
<v Speaker 1>but on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make sure that your story doesn't define</v>

83
00:04:20.801 --> 00:04:22.720
<v Speaker 1>you as someone who is great with </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>

84
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.530
<v Speaker 1>Just define yourself as someone who can </v>
<v Speaker 1>get the right result by taking the right</v>

85
00:04:26.531 --> 00:04:29.980
<v Speaker 1>action and dealing with all the little </v>
<v Speaker 1>challenges along the way.</v>

86
00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.690
<v Speaker 1>No more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no less.</v>

87
00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.760
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for watching the [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 1>folks channel.</v>

88
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.670
<v Speaker 1>Please leave your comments down below </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'll talk to you again.</v>

89
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:37.683
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
