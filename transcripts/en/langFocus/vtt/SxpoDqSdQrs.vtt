00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.610
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Lange focus channel.</v>

2
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:03.473
<v Speaker 1>My name is Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today I'm going to be talking about a </v>

3
00:00:05.761 --> 00:00:06.594
<v Speaker 1>language learning tool called memorize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tend to be a traditional kind of </v>

4
00:00:10.141 --> 00:00:10.974
<v Speaker 1>learner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I focus on using textbooks on audio </v>

5
00:00:13.171 --> 00:00:16.050
<v Speaker 1>listening materials are not </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicating with native speakers.</v>

6
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.840
<v Speaker 1>Those are the staples of my typical </v>
<v Speaker 1>study routine,</v>

7
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.080
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of people ask me about things </v>
<v Speaker 1>like memorize.</v>

8
00:00:22.081 --> 00:00:22.914
<v Speaker 1>So I decided to give,</v>
<v Speaker 1>memorize a try and give you my review </v>

9
00:00:26.101 --> 00:00:28.260
<v Speaker 1>and tell you my impression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So first of all,</v>

10
00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:29.820
<v Speaker 1>what is memorize?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

11
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:30.743
<v Speaker 1>memorize is a language learning platform</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's available on your desktop </v>

12
00:00:33.931 --> 00:00:34.764
<v Speaker 1>computer or on your smartphone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it is basically a system for </v>

13
00:00:37.861 --> 00:00:41.970
<v Speaker 1>memorizing using flashcards with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>spaced repetition system.</v>

14
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.780
<v Speaker 1>So it's similar to something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] in which you use a flashcard</v>

15
00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.500
<v Speaker 1>and to learn a word and then you review </v>
<v Speaker 1>it at graduated intervals.</v>

16
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.860
<v Speaker 1>Those intervals get longer each time you</v>
<v Speaker 1>review the word,</v>

17
00:00:52.861 --> 00:00:55.770
<v Speaker 1>so maybe the first time you review it </v>
<v Speaker 1>two minutes later,</v>

18
00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.350
<v Speaker 1>but then after that the next review </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes 10 minutes later,</v>

19
00:00:58.351 --> 00:01:00.960
<v Speaker 1>the next one comes 30 minutes later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of thing.</v>

20
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.913
<v Speaker 1>So you're increasing the interval </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the reviews of the flashcard </v>

21
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:05.573
<v Speaker 1>each time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I mean by a spaced </v>

22
00:01:07.051 --> 00:01:11.130
<v Speaker 1>repetition system memorizes used </v>
<v Speaker 1>primarily for language learning,</v>

23
00:01:11.131 --> 00:01:15.480
<v Speaker 1>but you can use it for other kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>information to like geography or biology</v>

24
00:01:15.481 --> 00:01:17.970
<v Speaker 1>or whatever information you could put on</v>
<v Speaker 1>flashcards.</v>

25
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.090
<v Speaker 1>You can make flashcards and use them in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the memorized system.</v>

26
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.150
<v Speaker 1>One of the pillars of the memorize </v>
<v Speaker 1>approach is science.</v>

27
00:01:24.151 --> 00:01:24.984
<v Speaker 1>They claim to have a lot of legitimate </v>
<v Speaker 1>science behind their approach behind </v>

28
00:01:27.991 --> 00:01:28.824
<v Speaker 1>their technology with one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>founders of memorize being a </v>

29
00:01:31.081 --> 00:01:35.870
<v Speaker 1>neuroscientist and the other one being </v>
<v Speaker 1>an award winning master of memory,</v>

30
00:01:35.871 --> 00:01:38.280
<v Speaker 1>someone who's won a lot of memory </v>
<v Speaker 1>contests,</v>

31
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.143
<v Speaker 1>that kind of thing.</v>

32
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.770
<v Speaker 1>The science of memorize focuses on two </v>
<v Speaker 1>things in coding and testing.</v>

33
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:44.783
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing that memorize is </v>
<v Speaker 1>focused on is encoding new information </v>

34
00:01:48.061 --> 00:01:48.894
<v Speaker 1>into your memory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that is done by using something </v>

35
00:01:50.941 --> 00:01:51.774
<v Speaker 1>called memes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What memes are is they are kind of </v>

36
00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.320
<v Speaker 1>multimedia bits of information that can </v>
<v Speaker 1>help you connect to that new information</v>

37
00:01:58.321 --> 00:02:01.620
<v Speaker 1>to something you already know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it could be an image.</v>

38
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.030
<v Speaker 1>So you're associating that new phrase or</v>
<v Speaker 1>a word with an image that is familiar to</v>

39
00:02:06.031 --> 00:02:06.864
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be a funny sentence or a </v>

40
00:02:08.521 --> 00:02:10.320
<v Speaker 1>shocking sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

41
00:02:10.321 --> 00:02:11.154
<v Speaker 1>It could be a mnemonic device.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any of these kinds of things that can </v>

42
00:02:13.921 --> 00:02:14.754
<v Speaker 1>help you connect that new information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make some connections and retrieve that </v>

43
00:02:17.881 --> 00:02:20.850
<v Speaker 1>memory later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those can be used as memes.</v>

44
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.010
<v Speaker 1>If you're an experienced language </v>
<v Speaker 1>learners,</v>

45
00:02:26.011 --> 00:02:26.844
<v Speaker 1>and you might be good at coming up with </v>
<v Speaker 1>memes of your own off the top of your </v>

46
00:02:29.371 --> 00:02:30.600
<v Speaker 1>head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you're not,</v>

47
00:02:30.601 --> 00:02:31.434
<v Speaker 1>or if you just need extra ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you get these memes within the </v>

48
00:02:34.201 --> 00:02:36.360
<v Speaker 1>memorize system that are provided for </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

49
00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.250
<v Speaker 1>So those memes are for the purpose of </v>
<v Speaker 1>encoding new information into memory.</v>

50
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.540
<v Speaker 1>The second scientific principle that </v>
<v Speaker 1>memorize this,</v>

51
00:02:45.541 --> 00:02:46.374
<v Speaker 1>focused on his testing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So after you have encoded that new </v>

52
00:02:48.451 --> 00:02:51.720
<v Speaker 1>information as a memory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the next thing is to test yourself.</v>

53
00:02:51.721 --> 00:02:52.554
<v Speaker 1>That is to prompt yourself to recall </v>
<v Speaker 1>that information later on before you </v>

54
00:02:56.041 --> 00:02:58.470
<v Speaker 1>forget it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you do recall that information,</v>

55
00:02:58.471 --> 00:03:01.810
<v Speaker 1>that strengthens the memory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

56
00:03:01.811 --> 00:03:02.644
<v Speaker 1>next I'll talk about the content.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by that I mean the courses and the </v>

57
00:03:05.531 --> 00:03:08.920
<v Speaker 1>flashcards that you can learn from </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside the memorized system.</v>

58
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.053
<v Speaker 1>Memorize content is organized into </v>
<v Speaker 1>courses and each of those courses </v>

59
00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:14.613
<v Speaker 1>consists of a bunch of flashcards and </v>
<v Speaker 1>those courses are created by memrise </v>

60
00:03:17.981 --> 00:03:18.370
<v Speaker 1>users.</v>

61
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.670
<v Speaker 1>They're not created by the founders of </v>
<v Speaker 1>memorize or their employees,</v>

62
00:03:21.671 --> 00:03:24.430
<v Speaker 1>the created by you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people who use memorize.</v>

63
00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:25.413
<v Speaker 1>So anyone who has the desktop version of</v>
<v Speaker 1>memorize can create a course anytime </v>

64
00:03:28.331 --> 00:03:29.164
<v Speaker 1>they want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that means that there's a huge </v>

65
00:03:30.251 --> 00:03:34.300
<v Speaker 1>variety of courses available.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are tons of courses on memorize.</v>

66
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.170
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to talk about the positives</v>

67
00:03:38.171 --> 00:03:39.004
<v Speaker 1>and the negatives of memorize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then after that I'll give you my </v>

68
00:03:41.021 --> 00:03:44.530
<v Speaker 1>final thoughts in summary on this tool </v>
<v Speaker 1>for language learning.</v>

69
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:45.543
<v Speaker 1>So the positives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>number one is just the sheer number of </v>

70
00:03:47.771 --> 00:03:48.604
<v Speaker 1>courses available.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The amount of content on memorize is </v>

71
00:03:51.161 --> 00:03:51.994
<v Speaker 1>staggering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the courses available at </v>

72
00:03:53.951 --> 00:03:54.784
<v Speaker 1>the languages available,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just tons and tons to choose </v>

73
00:03:56.711 --> 00:03:57.544
<v Speaker 1>from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like being a kid in a candy </v>

74
00:03:59.231 --> 00:04:00.064
<v Speaker 1>store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really a lot of fun just to browse </v>

75
00:04:01.331 --> 00:04:04.060
<v Speaker 1>through there and think about what </v>
<v Speaker 1>course do you want to try next.</v>

76
00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:06.310
<v Speaker 1>So let's take a look at the selection </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside.</v>

77
00:04:06.311 --> 00:04:09.280
<v Speaker 1>Memorize plumps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here we are on the memorize homepage,</v>

78
00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.860
<v Speaker 1>and if I click on the courses button </v>
<v Speaker 1>over here,</v>

79
00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.890
<v Speaker 1>we'll see some of the featured courses </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the front page.</v>

80
00:04:14.891 --> 00:04:17.640
<v Speaker 1>So we have learned basic Russian learn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basic Brazilian,</v>

81
00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:18.483
<v Speaker 1>that et Cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So at least ones are particularly </v>

82
00:04:19.841 --> 00:04:22.270
<v Speaker 1>popular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they are featured on the front page,</v>

83
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.940
<v Speaker 1>but these are not the only language </v>
<v Speaker 1>courses available.</v>

84
00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.880
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at the left hand sidebar and </v>
<v Speaker 1>see some of the others.</v>

85
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.370
<v Speaker 1>So this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are the top categories,</v>

86
00:04:30.371 --> 00:04:34.450
<v Speaker 1>the most popular languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but look down below that and we can look</v>

87
00:04:34.451 --> 00:04:37.330
<v Speaker 1>at all categories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you see there are some other subjects</v>

88
00:04:37.331 --> 00:04:39.670
<v Speaker 1>like Trivia and memory training,</v>
<v Speaker 1>history,</v>

89
00:04:39.671 --> 00:04:40.504
<v Speaker 1>geography.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But let's look at languages looked at </v>

90
00:04:42.671 --> 00:04:43.504
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got all languages or language is </v>

91
00:04:46.361 --> 00:04:49.420
<v Speaker 1>broken down into regions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's click on for example,</v>

92
00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.450
<v Speaker 1>African and see how many languages there</v>
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

93
00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.210
<v Speaker 1>You can see there's a big long list of </v>
<v Speaker 1>African languages,</v>

94
00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.790
<v Speaker 1>Zulu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kosa,</v>

95
00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:58.810
<v Speaker 1>Wallace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somali.</v>

96
00:04:58.811 --> 00:05:02.470
<v Speaker 1>There's all these languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's have a look up above at,</v>

97
00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.360
<v Speaker 1>let's see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Asian and Pacific.</v>

98
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:05.223
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of the Asian languages are </v>

99
00:05:06.581 --> 00:05:07.420
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indonesian,</v>

100
00:05:07.421 --> 00:05:08.111
<v Speaker 1>Korean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thai,</v>

101
00:05:08.111 --> 00:05:11.080
<v Speaker 1>Vietnamese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even I knew even the,</v>

102
00:05:11.081 --> 00:05:15.840
<v Speaker 1>I knew language from Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a very endangered language even</v>

103
00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:17.003
<v Speaker 1>nowadays.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a lot of languages that are </v>

104
00:05:18.341 --> 00:05:21.640
<v Speaker 1>much less widely studied that courses </v>
<v Speaker 1>are available for it.</v>

105
00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:22.773
<v Speaker 1>Let's choose a language and click on it </v>
<v Speaker 1>just to see the variety of courses that </v>

106
00:05:25.811 --> 00:05:28.150
<v Speaker 1>you can get just for that one language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's click,</v>

107
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.630
<v Speaker 1>let's not click the top one because that</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be too obvious.</v>

108
00:05:31.631 --> 00:05:32.980
<v Speaker 1>Let's click,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's see,</v>

109
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.710
<v Speaker 1>how about Italian?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's go for that.</v>

110
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.943
<v Speaker 1>So we've got learn basic Italian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know exactly what it consists </v>

111
00:05:41.261 --> 00:05:42.094
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it says learn Italian vocab and </v>

112
00:05:43.151 --> 00:05:44.170
<v Speaker 1>grammar verbs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>phrases.</v>

113
00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:45.850
<v Speaker 1>And down here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's see,</v>

114
00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:46.900
<v Speaker 1>intermediate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Italian,</v>

115
00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.450
<v Speaker 1>Italian verbs and expressions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>introductory Italian,</v>

116
00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:54.010
<v Speaker 1>the 500 most common Italian verbs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hacking,</v>

117
00:05:54.011 --> 00:05:54.940
<v Speaker 1>Italian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>elementary,</v>

118
00:05:54.941 --> 00:05:55.774
<v Speaker 1>Italian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these are all different courses by </v>

119
00:05:57.501 --> 00:05:59.960
<v Speaker 1>users.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them might cover similar things,</v>

120
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:02.360
<v Speaker 1>so you probably don't want to do all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the courses,</v>

121
00:06:02.361 --> 00:06:03.194
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot to choose from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is part of the fun of looking </v>

122
00:06:05.451 --> 00:06:06.284
<v Speaker 1>around inside memorize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you don't have to start at the </v>

123
00:06:08.181 --> 00:06:11.000
<v Speaker 1>beginning and follow a linear path with </v>
<v Speaker 1>any kind.</v>

124
00:06:11.001 --> 00:06:11.834
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can jump around and skip around a </v>

125
00:06:13.101 --> 00:06:13.934
<v Speaker 1>little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can do multiple courses at the same </v>

126
00:06:15.441 --> 00:06:16.790
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really up to you.</v>

127
00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:19.160
<v Speaker 1>It's nice to have that flexibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

128
00:06:19.161 --> 00:06:22.940
<v Speaker 1>The second positive thing is that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>system of encoding and testing,</v>

129
00:06:22.941 --> 00:06:23.774
<v Speaker 1>it's quite effective in my opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried out some to gallows and French </v>

130
00:06:26.631 --> 00:06:27.464
<v Speaker 1>courses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I also tried out a Turkish course </v>

131
00:06:29.091 --> 00:06:29.924
<v Speaker 1>because Turkish is a language that I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>never studied and I got a chance to see </v>

132
00:06:32.811 --> 00:06:36.260
<v Speaker 1>how it feels to learn a language from </v>
<v Speaker 1>scratch using memorize.</v>

133
00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.750
<v Speaker 1>I didn't get really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really far with that course.</v>

134
00:06:38.751 --> 00:06:39.584
<v Speaker 1>I just did a few lessons in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I had a chance to see how well I </v>

135
00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:43.694
<v Speaker 1>remembered things and I felt that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>remembered the words quite well because </v>

136
00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:48.283
<v Speaker 1>I was prompted to recall the words at </v>
<v Speaker 1>times when I was just about to forget </v>

137
00:06:52.431 --> 00:06:53.264
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's actually really good in </v>

138
00:06:54.591 --> 00:06:55.424
<v Speaker 1>spaced repetition and the goal is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to retrieve the word right </v>

139
00:06:58.911 --> 00:06:59.744
<v Speaker 1>before you forget it because the more </v>
<v Speaker 1>effort it takes to recall and retrieve </v>

140
00:07:02.451 --> 00:07:03.284
<v Speaker 1>that word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the the more you will strengthen that </v>

141
00:07:05.391 --> 00:07:06.224
<v Speaker 1>memory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it felt like the memorize system had </v>

142
00:07:07.581 --> 00:07:11.960
<v Speaker 1>really strategically timed when I needed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to review that word right on the edge of</v>

143
00:07:11.961 --> 00:07:13.160
<v Speaker 1>forgetting it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is good.</v>

144
00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:16.730
<v Speaker 1>I also found the memes quite useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm an experienced language learner.</v>

145
00:07:16.731 --> 00:07:18.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty good at coming up with my own</v>
<v Speaker 1>memes.</v>

146
00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:23.330
<v Speaker 1>But having a bunch of crowdsourced memes</v>
<v Speaker 1>to choose from makes it just really easy</v>

147
00:07:23.331 --> 00:07:24.164
<v Speaker 1>and quick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes you see one that really </v>

148
00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.580
<v Speaker 1>you connect with and you want to use </v>
<v Speaker 1>more than your own,</v>

149
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:31.070
<v Speaker 1>and that just makes everything easier </v>
<v Speaker 1>and smoother.</v>

150
00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:32.540
<v Speaker 1>So so there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why not?</v>

151
00:07:32.541 --> 00:07:33.650
<v Speaker 1>It's useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

152
00:07:33.651 --> 00:07:34.484
<v Speaker 1>So now for a couple of negative things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first negative point is that </v>

153
00:07:37.641 --> 00:07:41.090
<v Speaker 1>memorize is not really a comprehensive </v>
<v Speaker 1>language learning system.</v>

154
00:07:41.091 --> 00:07:44.870
<v Speaker 1>It's basically a flashcard drilling </v>
<v Speaker 1>system with spaced repetition.</v>

155
00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:49.220
<v Speaker 1>So it's not something I would use to </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn a language completely from scratch</v>

156
00:07:49.221 --> 00:07:50.054
<v Speaker 1>all by itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't really get any explanation </v>

157
00:07:52.221 --> 00:07:55.040
<v Speaker 1>about the grammar or phonology or </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything like that.</v>

158
00:07:55.041 --> 00:07:57.050
<v Speaker 1>So sometimes when it's practicing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>memorize,</v>

159
00:07:57.051 --> 00:07:57.884
<v Speaker 1>I would be looking at a word and </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking why are the letters pronounced </v>

160
00:08:00.141 --> 00:08:00.920
<v Speaker 1>this way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

161
00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:01.753
<v Speaker 1>I really would like to have some </v>
<v Speaker 1>explanation of the phonology or things </v>

162
00:08:04.191 --> 00:08:04.850
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

163
00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:05.683
<v Speaker 1>But of course there is none.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm pretty good at to do sing that </v>

164
00:08:08.511 --> 00:08:10.520
<v Speaker 1>stuff from examples just from </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

165
00:08:10.521 --> 00:08:11.354
<v Speaker 1>And that's the way I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think a lot of people really need </v>

166
00:08:13.671 --> 00:08:15.770
<v Speaker 1>to have that explanation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even for me,</v>

167
00:08:15.771 --> 00:08:17.690
<v Speaker 1>it's good to have it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes it easier.</v>

168
00:08:17.691 --> 00:08:18.524
<v Speaker 1>So just the lack of explanation and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was the lack of presentation of the </v>

169
00:08:21.381 --> 00:08:25.460
<v Speaker 1>language concepts makes it less than a </v>
<v Speaker 1>full language learning course.</v>

170
00:08:25.461 --> 00:08:29.840
<v Speaker 1>It's really just drilling vocabulary of </v>
<v Speaker 1>phrases and translation of sentences.</v>

171
00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:30.793
<v Speaker 1>So that means that basically you should </v>
<v Speaker 1>use memorize along with another course </v>

172
00:08:33.231 --> 00:08:34.940
<v Speaker 1>that is more comprehensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

173
00:08:34.941 --> 00:08:35.774
<v Speaker 1>The second negative thing is that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>user generated courses are both a </v>

174
00:08:38.661 --> 00:08:40.610
<v Speaker 1>blessing and a curse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I said before,</v>

175
00:08:40.611 --> 00:08:42.380
<v Speaker 1>they're a blessing because there's such </v>
<v Speaker 1>an,</v>

176
00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:45.950
<v Speaker 1>an awesome amount of variety and such a </v>
<v Speaker 1>selection to choose from.</v>

177
00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:46.993
<v Speaker 1>But at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not really a lot of quality </v>

178
00:08:49.281 --> 00:08:52.160
<v Speaker 1>control and there's no standardization </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the courses.</v>

179
00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:54.110
<v Speaker 1>Some of them are a lot better than </v>
<v Speaker 1>others.</v>

180
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.033
<v Speaker 1>Some of them seem to introduce words in </v>
<v Speaker 1>a really strange order or they start </v>

181
00:08:58.081 --> 00:08:58.914
<v Speaker 1>with things that in the beginning that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't need yet and that kind of </v>

182
00:09:00.691 --> 00:09:01.524
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I found that I really had to search </v>

183
00:09:03.211 --> 00:09:04.044
<v Speaker 1>around and try a few different courses </v>
<v Speaker 1>to see which one fit my needs and then </v>

184
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:08.333
<v Speaker 1>if it didn't fit my needs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just leave that course and join a </v>

185
00:09:10.531 --> 00:09:12.090
<v Speaker 1>different one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have to look around,</v>

186
00:09:12.091 --> 00:09:15.330
<v Speaker 1>shop around a little bit before you </v>
<v Speaker 1>decide what course to use.</v>

187
00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:16.223
<v Speaker 1>So that's a little bit different than </v>
<v Speaker 1>some other language learning platforms </v>

188
00:09:18.331 --> 00:09:19.164
<v Speaker 1>that have been kind of refined and </v>
<v Speaker 1>standardized more so that you kind of </v>

189
00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.033
<v Speaker 1>always know that you're getting a course</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they themselves have developed and </v>

190
00:09:25.921 --> 00:09:26.754
<v Speaker 1>focused on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically to sum up my positives and </v>

191
00:09:28.861 --> 00:09:29.694
<v Speaker 1>negatives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say that memorize is actually a </v>

192
00:09:31.171 --> 00:09:32.004
<v Speaker 1>really useful tool for drilling </v>
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary and for drilling sentences </v>

193
00:09:36.061 --> 00:09:39.630
<v Speaker 1>and maybe doing some sentence to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sentence translation and it's a fun tool</v>

194
00:09:39.631 --> 00:09:41.520
<v Speaker 1>to use so it's good as a supplement.</v>

195
00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:45.210
<v Speaker 1>It's good to get that extra source of </v>
<v Speaker 1>input of the language.</v>

196
00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:46.223
<v Speaker 1>It's just a useful tool but it's not a </v>
<v Speaker 1>comprehensive language learning program </v>

197
00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:50.393
<v Speaker 1>so I wouldn't stick to only memorize </v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you're just dabbling in a </v>

198
00:09:53.731 --> 00:09:56.190
<v Speaker 1>language on the side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're focused on French and you</v>

199
00:09:56.191 --> 00:09:58.950
<v Speaker 1>want to learn a bit of Portuguese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then just use memorize.</v>

200
00:09:58.951 --> 00:09:59.784
<v Speaker 1>For some Portuguese that would be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you are really taking a language </v>

201
00:10:02.791 --> 00:10:05.310
<v Speaker 1>seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have a comprehensive main course</v>

202
00:10:05.311 --> 00:10:08.820
<v Speaker 1>and then use memorize as an extra </v>
<v Speaker 1>additional helpful tool,</v>

203
00:10:08.821 --> 00:10:11.070
<v Speaker 1>which it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's all from my impressions.</v>

204
00:10:11.071 --> 00:10:13.500
<v Speaker 1>But how about you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you tried memorize?</v>

205
00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:14.363
<v Speaker 1>If you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I ask you to leave your comments </v>

206

<v Speaker 1>Tell me what you thought of it,</v>

207
00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:18.653
<v Speaker 1>was it useful for you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you have some tips on how to use </v>

208
00:10:20.551 --> 00:10:23.100
<v Speaker 1>it more effectively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then please write that as well.</v>
