00:00:01.681 --> 00:00:02.910
<v Speaker 1>twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and instagram.</v>

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.400
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Lange focus channel.</v>

4
00:00:07.401 --> 00:00:08.420
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my name is Paul.</v>

5
00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.530
<v Speaker 1>Today's video is the third installment </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the mystery languages series.</v>

6
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.840
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you've seen mystery languages one </v>
<v Speaker 1>and two.</v>

7
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.880
<v Speaker 1>If not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can find them right here.</v>

8
00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.240
<v Speaker 1>But here's how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll play you a sample of a language and</v>

9
00:00:20.241 --> 00:00:21.074
<v Speaker 1>then I'll show you a written sample of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the language and you can make an </v>

10
00:00:23.031 --> 00:00:25.400
<v Speaker 1>educated guess as to what that language </v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

11
00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.580
<v Speaker 1>And don't worry if you can't get the </v>
<v Speaker 1>exact language correctly.</v>

12
00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:29.443
<v Speaker 1>The important thing is that you tell us </v>
<v Speaker 1>your guesses and your reason for your </v>

13
00:00:31.521 --> 00:00:34.760
<v Speaker 1>guesses in the comments down below.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that will start a lot of interesting</v>

14
00:00:34.761 --> 00:00:35.594
<v Speaker 1>discussions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's get right into the first </v>

15
00:00:36.771 --> 00:00:37.970
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Please listen.</v>

16
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:40.123
<v Speaker 2>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Miss [inaudible] [inaudible] </v>

17
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.110
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>an example is [inaudible]. [inaudible]</v>

18
00:00:52.891 --> 00:00:53.724
<v Speaker 2>was purse.</v>

19
00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.260
<v Speaker 1>Now let's see some written samples of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that language.</v>

20
00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:57.453
<v Speaker 1>Kwong Costa show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means how much is this Anisa </v>

21
00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:01.363
<v Speaker 1>lovable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means where's the toilet bodily Mr </v>

22
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:07.360
<v Speaker 1>pocket boxes plow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means speak more slowly,</v>

23
00:01:07.361 --> 00:01:08.194
<v Speaker 1>please.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] this means could you write </v>

24
00:01:11.731 --> 00:01:14.080
<v Speaker 1>it please?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what language is it?</v>

25
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.833
<v Speaker 1>The language is Catalan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a romance language spoken mostly in </v>

26
00:01:21.241 --> 00:01:24.480
<v Speaker 1>eastern Spain as well as in Andorra and </v>
<v Speaker 1>in part of France.</v>

27
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.780
<v Speaker 1>If you guessed Spanish or Portuguese or </v>
<v Speaker 1>another romance language,</v>

28
00:01:27.781 --> 00:01:29.640
<v Speaker 1>then you're not too far off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

29
00:01:29.641 --> 00:01:33.210
<v Speaker 1>Katelyn has 85% lexical similarity with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Spanish,</v>

30
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.790
<v Speaker 1>but the two are only partly mutually </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligible.</v>

31
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.600
<v Speaker 1>Catalan is part of the Occidental </v>
<v Speaker 1>Romance sub family along with oxytocin.</v>

32
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:40.733
<v Speaker 1>It's always interesting to take a look </v>
<v Speaker 1>at a romance language that you're not </v>

33
00:01:42.721 --> 00:01:43.554
<v Speaker 1>too familiar with because you might see </v>
<v Speaker 1>some features of one romance language </v>

34
00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.540
<v Speaker 1>and some different features from another</v>
<v Speaker 1>romance language.</v>

35
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.860
<v Speaker 1>If we look at the sentence again for </v>
<v Speaker 1>three area,</v>

36
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.850
<v Speaker 1>looks like the Spanish word for could </v>
<v Speaker 1>this word [inaudible].</v>

37
00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.020
<v Speaker 1>It seems kind of like a clear in French </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] in Italian,</v>

38
00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.210
<v Speaker 1>which mean to write.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this phrase,</v>

39
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.270
<v Speaker 1>see you plow seems like silver plate in </v>
<v Speaker 1>front,</v>

40
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.433
<v Speaker 1>so you can see why some people say that </v>
<v Speaker 1>learning to romance languages helps you </v>

41
00:02:06.961 --> 00:02:09.590
<v Speaker 1>understand a fair bit of the others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in writing.</v>

42
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.420
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Onto the next language.</v>

43
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.480
<v Speaker 1>Please listen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

44
00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.890
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

45
00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.380
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

46
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:26.430
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

47
00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.023
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's have a look at some written </v>

48
00:02:29.841 --> 00:02:33.240
<v Speaker 1>samples in Gemini.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means,</v>

49
00:02:33.241 --> 00:02:37.980
<v Speaker 1>how are you when said to a male </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] work in decibels,</v>

50
00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.030
<v Speaker 1>this means pleased to meet you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sim,</v>

51
00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.110
<v Speaker 1>my no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this means,</v>

52
00:02:43.111 --> 00:02:46.860
<v Speaker 1>what is your name when said to a male </v>
<v Speaker 1>Aerosol Kaya to note,</v>

53
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.650
<v Speaker 1>and this means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where are you from?</v>

54
00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.060
<v Speaker 1>So what language is it?</v>

55
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.350
<v Speaker 1>The languages?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Horic,</v>

56
00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm horic is a language spoken in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ethiopia by around 22 million people.</v>

57
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.780
<v Speaker 1>It's a member of the Semitic language </v>
<v Speaker 1>family,</v>

58
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.940
<v Speaker 1>meaning that it's related to Arabic and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hebrew,</v>

59
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.340
<v Speaker 1>but it's not intelligible with those </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>

60
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.410
<v Speaker 1>I've studied Hebrew and Arabic in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>past,</v>

61
00:03:08.411 --> 00:03:10.330
<v Speaker 1>but I can't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Arik at all.</v>

62
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:11.403
<v Speaker 1>But there are a couple of cognates I can</v>
<v Speaker 1>see in these written samples like the </v>

63
00:03:13.811 --> 00:03:14.644
<v Speaker 1>word for name Sim in Arabic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the word is Islam and in Hebrew it's </v>

64
00:03:18.401 --> 00:03:19.234
<v Speaker 1>Shim here and I'm horic summer is your </v>
<v Speaker 1>name with the suffix being a possessive </v>

65
00:03:24.611 --> 00:03:25.444
<v Speaker 1>pronoun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Arabic you'd say is muck and in </v>

66
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.760
<v Speaker 1>Hebrew you'd say a Shim Heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also mum is the word for what?</v>

67
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.420
<v Speaker 1>Which might be related to the Arabic </v>
<v Speaker 1>word math and the Hebrew word mark.</v>

68
00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.430
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Onto the next language,</v>

69
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.353
<v Speaker 1>please listen.</v>

70
00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:38.483
<v Speaker 3>Kiva Gosiger very challenging.</v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] the unit mini van </v>

71
00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.020
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible]</v>

72
00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.023
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's see some written samples of this </v>

73
00:03:56.201 --> 00:04:01.201
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means pleased to meet you.</v>

74
00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:05.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to [inaudible] this means </v>
<v Speaker 1>where are you from?</v>

75
00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:07.770
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible]</v>

76
00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:09.620
<v Speaker 1>this means long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

77
00:04:09.621 --> 00:04:13.580
<v Speaker 1>see [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means have a good journey.</v>

78
00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:18.530
<v Speaker 1>So what languages it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the Tamil language.</v>

79
00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.520
<v Speaker 1>Tamil is the language spoken in southern</v>
<v Speaker 1>India as well as in Sri Lanka as well as</v>

80
00:04:22.521 --> 00:04:25.400
<v Speaker 1>by Tamil communities overseas and places</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Malaysia.</v>

81
00:04:25.401 --> 00:04:26.234
<v Speaker 1>And Singapore is a dravidian language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is unrelated to the Indo European </v>

82
00:04:29.781 --> 00:04:30.614
<v Speaker 1>languages spoken in northern India.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tamil has a long literary history </v>

83
00:04:33.351 --> 00:04:36.050
<v Speaker 1>reaching back to around 2,600</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

84
00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.770
<v Speaker 1>The temple script is an aggregator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning a script in which consonants and</v>

85
00:04:39.771 --> 00:04:42.710
<v Speaker 1>vowels are written together as units,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which can't be separated.</v>

86
00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:43.603
<v Speaker 1>Come to think of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the [inaudible] script that we had a </v>

87
00:04:44.961 --> 00:04:47.030
<v Speaker 1>glance at earlier is also an avid </v>
<v Speaker 1>reader.</v>

88
00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:48.043
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope you had fun guessing today's </v>

89
00:04:49.011 --> 00:04:49.844

<v Speaker 1>down below.</v>

91
00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.390
<v Speaker 1>And I'm sure that that will start lots </v>
<v Speaker 1>of interesting discussions.</v>
