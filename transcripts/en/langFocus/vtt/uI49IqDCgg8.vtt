00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:01.283
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and </v>

2
00:00:02.911 --> 00:00:06.810
<v Speaker 1>my name is Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today's topic is the African's language.</v>

3
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.110
<v Speaker 1>A couple of weeks ago I released a video</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the Dutch language,</v>

4
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.680
<v Speaker 1>which you can find right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is kind of a followup to that video</v>

5
00:00:13.681 --> 00:00:16.530
<v Speaker 1>because Afrikaans is a descendant of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dutch.</v>

6
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.340
<v Speaker 1>That means that just like Dutch </v>
<v Speaker 1>Afrikaans is a west Germanic language.</v>

7
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.410
<v Speaker 1>Afrikaans has a total of about 7.1</v>
<v Speaker 1>million native speakers with 6.8</v>

8
00:00:25.411 --> 00:00:29.310
<v Speaker 1>5 million of those in South Africa and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's about 13.5%</v>

9
00:00:29.311 --> 00:00:30.144
<v Speaker 1>of the South African population that </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes it the third most widely spoken </v>

10
00:00:32.911 --> 00:00:36.480
<v Speaker 1>language in South Africa and it's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>majority language in the western half of</v>

11
00:00:36.481 --> 00:00:37.314
<v Speaker 1>the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means Northern Cape and Western </v>

12
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.510
<v Speaker 1>Cape provinces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the native language of about 61% of</v>

13
00:00:42.511 --> 00:00:43.344
<v Speaker 1>white South Africans and it's the native</v>
<v Speaker 1>language of more than three quarters of </v>

14
00:00:46.111 --> 00:00:49.230
<v Speaker 1>quote unquote colored South Africans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about 3.4</v>

15
00:00:49.231 --> 00:00:51.660
<v Speaker 1>million people in South Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The term colored,</v>

16
00:00:51.661 --> 00:00:53.580
<v Speaker 1>it means people love mixed racial </v>
<v Speaker 1>background.</v>

17
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.660
<v Speaker 1>I didn't choose that term myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also the native language of 4.6%</v>

18
00:00:57.661 --> 00:01:01.500
<v Speaker 1>of Asian South Africans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also the native language of 1.5%</v>

19
00:01:01.501 --> 00:01:03.960
<v Speaker 1>of black South Africans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's about 600,000</v>

20
00:01:03.961 --> 00:01:04.794
<v Speaker 1>people and there are 10 to 15000002nd </v>
<v Speaker 1>language speakers in South Africa in </v>

21
00:01:08.581 --> 00:01:11.280
<v Speaker 1>Namibia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the native language of 10 or 11% of</v>

22
00:01:11.281 --> 00:01:13.860
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including 60% of the white population.</v>

23
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.060
<v Speaker 1>It's also widely used as a Lingua Franca</v>
<v Speaker 1>and most people can speak it as a second</v>

24
00:01:18.061 --> 00:01:21.090
<v Speaker 1>or third language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how did the story of Afrikaans Begin?</v>

25
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.953
<v Speaker 1>Dutch speaking settlers arrived in </v>
<v Speaker 1>southern Africa in the year 1652 when </v>

26
00:01:25.411 --> 00:01:26.244
<v Speaker 1>the Dutch east India company set up a </v>
<v Speaker 1>resupply station at Cape Town for its </v>

27
00:01:29.191 --> 00:01:32.310
<v Speaker 1>ships travelling to the Indian </v>
<v Speaker 1>subcontinent and to Southeast Asia.</v>

28
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.590
<v Speaker 1>Their goal was to get fresh water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>food,</v>

29
00:01:34.591 --> 00:01:36.690
<v Speaker 1>and other supplies for their long sea </v>
<v Speaker 1>journeys.</v>

30
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:37.583
<v Speaker 1>When the local [inaudible] people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who speak [inaudible] Sawn </v>

31
00:01:39.451 --> 00:01:40.284
<v Speaker 1>languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're unwilling to meet the trade </v>

32
00:01:41.641 --> 00:01:45.510
<v Speaker 1>demands of the Dutch east India company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The company drove them out of the area,</v>

33
00:01:45.511 --> 00:01:46.344
<v Speaker 1>into the inland and replaced them with </v>
<v Speaker 1>European settlers and with slaves from </v>

34
00:01:49.381 --> 00:01:50.430
<v Speaker 1>other parts of Africa.</v>

35
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.403
<v Speaker 1>Most of the farmers who were known as </v>
<v Speaker 1>borrowers were former laborers of the </v>

36
00:01:57.931 --> 00:02:00.360
<v Speaker 1>Dutch east India company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and most of them were Dutch,</v>

37
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.283
<v Speaker 1>but some of them were French or German,</v>
<v Speaker 1>too upset with the conditions placed </v>

38
00:02:04.201 --> 00:02:06.060
<v Speaker 1>upon them by the Dutch east India </v>
<v Speaker 1>company.</v>

39
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.930
<v Speaker 1>The European settlers began expanding </v>
<v Speaker 1>inland so they could farm outside of the</v>

40
00:02:09.931 --> 00:02:10.764
<v Speaker 1>area controlled by the company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Dutch east India company wanted to </v>

41
00:02:13.081 --> 00:02:13.914
<v Speaker 1>prevent this inland expansion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they outlawed the expansion and did </v>

42
00:02:16.681 --> 00:02:19.350
<v Speaker 1>European immigration and increased the </v>
<v Speaker 1>number of slaves.</v>

43
00:02:19.351 --> 00:02:21.330
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the slaves were brought from the</v>

44
00:02:21.331 --> 00:02:24.750
<v Speaker 1>Indian subcontinent and from present day</v>
<v Speaker 1>Malaysia and Indonesia,</v>

45
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:25.673
<v Speaker 1>Britain's seized control of the Cape </v>
<v Speaker 1>Colony in 1815 and began to import </v>

46
00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:29.813
<v Speaker 1>British settlers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The British eventually took steps to </v>

47
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.250
<v Speaker 1>eliminate slavery and to put heavy </v>
<v Speaker 1>restrictions on the border of farmers.</v>

48
00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.143
<v Speaker 1>Large numbers of bowlers migrated </v>
<v Speaker 1>further inland to escape British rule </v>

49
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.043
<v Speaker 1>setting up their own communities and </v>
<v Speaker 1>encountering various native African </v>

50
00:02:42.481 --> 00:02:43.620
<v Speaker 1>communities along the way.</v>

51
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.010
<v Speaker 1>After a series of conflicts with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>British called the bowral wars,</v>

52
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.873
<v Speaker 1>South Africa became a unified British </v>
<v Speaker 1>colony until its independence in 1961 </v>

53
00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.210
<v Speaker 1>but this is lang focus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're supposed to focus on languages.</v>

54
00:02:54.211 --> 00:02:55.800
<v Speaker 1>Why is all this history important?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

55
00:02:55.801 --> 00:02:59.350
<v Speaker 1>it's to help you imagine the conditions </v>
<v Speaker 1>under which the language spoken by those</v>

56
00:02:59.351 --> 00:03:02.410
<v Speaker 1>Dutch settlers changed and eventually </v>
<v Speaker 1>became Afrikaans.</v>

57
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:03.303
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How Africans developed is a highly </v>

58
00:03:05.021 --> 00:03:05.854
<v Speaker 1>debated subject with some people </v>
<v Speaker 1>insisting that it's a natural direct </v>

59
00:03:08.591 --> 00:03:09.424
<v Speaker 1>descendant of Dutch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While other people insist that it's </v>

60
00:03:11.111 --> 00:03:11.944
<v Speaker 1>actually a creole language that arose </v>
<v Speaker 1>when slaves and laborers attempted to </v>

61
00:03:14.921 --> 00:03:17.440
<v Speaker 1>learn Dutch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're not sure what creole languages</v>

62
00:03:17.441 --> 00:03:18.274
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can have a look at my video on </v>

63
00:03:18.941 --> 00:03:19.774
<v Speaker 1>pigeon and Creole languages right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody knows exactly what processes </v>

64
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:24.393
<v Speaker 1>caused Afrikaans to develop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's unlikely that either of those </v>

65
00:03:26.921 --> 00:03:30.220
<v Speaker 1>two theories is 100% true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the early years of the Cape Colony,</v>

66
00:03:30.221 --> 00:03:31.054
<v Speaker 1>there was a continuous stream of Dutch </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking immigrants as well as other </v>

67
00:03:33.581 --> 00:03:35.800
<v Speaker 1>Europeans who learn Dutch as a second </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

68
00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:36.693
<v Speaker 1>There were also many local speakers of </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] languages who learned Dutch </v>

69
00:03:39.191 --> 00:03:40.024
<v Speaker 1>as a second language and there were also</v>
<v Speaker 1>African and Asian slaves who learned </v>

70
00:03:42.341 --> 00:03:43.174
<v Speaker 1>Dutch as a second language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Local Africans and slaves most likely </v>

71
00:03:45.641 --> 00:03:47.950
<v Speaker 1>spoke a Dutch based pigeon language at </v>
<v Speaker 1>some point.</v>

72
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.843
<v Speaker 1>Typically a creole language arises when </v>
<v Speaker 1>a pidgin language becomes the native </v>

73
00:03:52.061 --> 00:03:52.894
<v Speaker 1>language of the next generation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>usually without a lot of influence from </v>

74
00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:58.240
<v Speaker 1>speakers of the original standard </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

75
00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:00.640
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slave owners or colonial settlers,</v>

76
00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:01.503
<v Speaker 1>but in the case of Africans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was always extensive contact with </v>

77
00:04:04.031 --> 00:04:04.864
<v Speaker 1>native speakers of Dutch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more specifically the emerging dialect </v>

78
00:04:07.301 --> 00:04:08.134
<v Speaker 1>called Cape Dutch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On top of that standard Dutch and not </v>

79
00:04:10.421 --> 00:04:13.180
<v Speaker 1>Cape Dutch was the language that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>taught in schools.</v>

80
00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:14.043
<v Speaker 1>Both of these factors would help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cape Dutch remain relatively similar to </v>

81
00:04:16.391 --> 00:04:17.224
<v Speaker 1>standard Dutch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so even if Afrikaans is a creole </v>

82
00:04:19.301 --> 00:04:20.134
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more like a partial creole or a </v>

83
00:04:21.581 --> 00:04:24.910
<v Speaker 1>semi creole language to creole languages</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I'm familiar with.</v>

84
00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:25.743
<v Speaker 1>Our top pcn and be slammer which are </v>
<v Speaker 1>spoken in Melanesia and they are </v>

85
00:04:28.721 --> 00:04:29.554
<v Speaker 1>english-based creoles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both of those languages consist of </v>

86
00:04:31.691 --> 00:04:34.240
<v Speaker 1>mainly English vocabulary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with the syntax,</v>

87
00:04:34.241 --> 00:04:36.790
<v Speaker 1>grammar and phonology of an oceanic </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

88
00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.510
<v Speaker 1>They're essentially new languages that </v>
<v Speaker 1>got their vocabulary from English,</v>

89
00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.750
<v Speaker 1>but Afrikaans is not like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's grammar became simplified,</v>

90
00:04:43.751 --> 00:04:44.584
<v Speaker 1>but the syntax of the language is </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically the same as Dutch and it's </v>

91
00:04:46.871 --> 00:04:50.710
<v Speaker 1>phonology is also close to Dutch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it seems that Africans developed from</v>

92
00:04:50.711 --> 00:04:51.544
<v Speaker 1>a form of Dutch that was influenced by </v>
<v Speaker 1>second language speakers rather than a </v>

93
00:04:54.431 --> 00:04:57.340
<v Speaker 1>completely new creole language featuring</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dutch vocabulary.</v>

94
00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:58.323
<v Speaker 1>That's my personal assessment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm sure some people will disagree </v>

95
00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:01.593
<v Speaker 1>and that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Africans continued to develop until it </v>

96
00:05:03.521 --> 00:05:04.354
<v Speaker 1>was legally recognized as its own </v>
<v Speaker 1>language in 1925 so how was Afrikaans </v>

97
00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.953
<v Speaker 1>different from Dutch lone words?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The vocabulary of Africans was </v>

98
00:05:11.531 --> 00:05:14.650
<v Speaker 1>influenced by the various languages that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it came in contact with.</v>

99
00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:15.940
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Molay,</v>

100
00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:16.803
<v Speaker 1>the word meaning almost comes from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Malay word hum being the word bio </v>

101
00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:25.480
<v Speaker 1>meaning much comes from the Malay Word </v>
<v Speaker 1>Been Yak Portuguese.</v>

102
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:29.290
<v Speaker 1>The word combat meaning blanket comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the Portuguese word.</v>

103
00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:30.213
<v Speaker 1>Who would the word cuddle?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meaning Catalan closure comes from the </v>

104
00:05:33.431 --> 00:05:34.450
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

105
00:05:34.451 --> 00:05:38.260
<v Speaker 1>How we have a similar word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>corral and English cohesin languages.</v>

106
00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:39.123
<v Speaker 1>The words for a lot of things in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>local African environment came from </v>

107
00:05:41.321 --> 00:05:42.790
<v Speaker 1>Khoisan languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

108
00:05:42.791 --> 00:05:45.010
<v Speaker 1>plants and animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This animal is called a Kudu.</v>

109
00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.903
<v Speaker 1>Good Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the overwhelming majority of </v>

110
00:05:47.111 --> 00:05:47.944
<v Speaker 1>Africans vocabulary is Dutch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than 90% or as high as 95% </v>

111
00:05:51.611 --> 00:05:52.444
<v Speaker 1>spelling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Africans underwent some spelling </v>

112
00:05:53.951 --> 00:05:54.784
<v Speaker 1>simplifications to make the written </v>
<v Speaker 1>language more reflective of the spoken </v>

113
00:05:57.681 --> 00:05:59.660
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't mention all of the changes,</v>

114
00:05:59.661 --> 00:06:03.230
<v Speaker 1>but here are some examples.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Dutch diagraph Ij pronounced,</v>

115
00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.730
<v Speaker 1>I became just a y in Afrikaans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we have the Dutch word could ice,</v>

116
00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:12.440
<v Speaker 1>which is spelled like this in Africans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Dutch words ending with Lij,</v>

117
00:06:12.441 --> 00:06:15.710
<v Speaker 1>k pronounced as Lik are spelled l I K </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Africans.</v>

118
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.530
<v Speaker 1>And that's a more accurate reflection of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real pronunciation.</v>

119
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:19.663
<v Speaker 1>Lay Look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lilach Dutch t I o n became Sio iom in </v>

120
00:06:23.481 --> 00:06:24.314
<v Speaker 1>Africans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we have the Dutch word not show now </v>

121
00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.380
<v Speaker 1>and this became the spelling and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Africans,</v>

122
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:30.553
<v Speaker 1>these Dutch diphthongs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are actually pronounced </v>

123
00:06:32.241 --> 00:06:35.120
<v Speaker 1>identically by many Dutch speakers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all became spelled,</v>

124
00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:36.013
<v Speaker 1>oh you in Afrikaans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the Dutch words and though are </v>

125
00:06:39.951 --> 00:06:42.830
<v Speaker 1>spelled like this in Afrikaans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>

126
00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:44.173
<v Speaker 1>there are also some other spelling </v>
<v Speaker 1>changes that represent new </v>

127
00:06:45.801 --> 00:06:48.290
<v Speaker 1>pronunciations and Africans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

128
00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:53.350
<v Speaker 1>Afrikaans merged the Dutch consonants,Z</v>
<v Speaker 1>and s two a single celled spelt s so the</v>

129
00:06:53.511 --> 00:06:54.344
<v Speaker 1>Dutch word became so in Afrikaans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a similar phonetic change can also be </v>

130
00:06:59.361 --> 00:07:02.750
<v Speaker 1>found in the northern Netherlands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not represented in writing only</v>

131
00:07:02.751 --> 00:07:05.120
<v Speaker 1>in speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Afrikaans also merged together.</v>

132
00:07:05.121 --> 00:07:05.954
<v Speaker 1>The Dutch sounds represented by c h and </v>
<v Speaker 1>g to a single sound spelled g and again </v>

133
00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:12.020
<v Speaker 1>a similar emerging also happened in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Netherlands,</v>

134
00:07:12.021 --> 00:07:14.720
<v Speaker 1>but not in spelling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only in sound in Afrikaans.</v>

135
00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.810
<v Speaker 1>When the g sound is proceeded by an </v>
<v Speaker 1>estimate as written as sk.</v>

136
00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:22.840
<v Speaker 1>So we have the Dutch word soul and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Africans word school between two vowels.</v>

137
00:07:23.601 --> 00:07:26.780
<v Speaker 1>The Dutch g and V consonants are omitted</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Africans.</v>

138
00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:28.370
<v Speaker 1>Look at these Dutch words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

139
00:07:28.371 --> 00:07:29.204
<v Speaker 1>hood that Ethan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now the Afrikaans equivalents the </v>

140
00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:34.043
<v Speaker 1>end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Notice that the second vowel requires a </v>

141
00:07:35.871 --> 00:07:36.704
<v Speaker 1>diacritic so that we know to pronounce </v>
<v Speaker 1>these as two separate vowels and not as </v>

142
00:07:39.261 --> 00:07:41.420
<v Speaker 1>one diphthong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are many more spelling changes,</v>

143
00:07:41.421 --> 00:07:44.330
<v Speaker 1>but those are a few examples to give you</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sense of how things changed.</v>

144
00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:45.253
<v Speaker 1>Verbs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the verb system and Afrikaans is quite </v>

145
00:07:46.761 --> 00:07:48.620
<v Speaker 1>simple compared to Dutch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

146
00:07:48.621 --> 00:07:52.880
<v Speaker 1>the simple past isn't used except for </v>
<v Speaker 1>eight basic verbs for all other verbs.</v>

147
00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:56.450
<v Speaker 1>The perfect tense is used instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is also a possible in Dutch too.</v>

148
00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.313
<v Speaker 1>So here's the Dutch sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning I watched a cake and now here's </v>

149
00:08:00.411 --> 00:08:02.050
<v Speaker 1>the African sentence pack.</v>

150
00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:02.883
<v Speaker 1>It's a cake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So notice that we use the perfect tense </v>

151
00:08:04.581 --> 00:08:06.530
<v Speaker 1>in Afrikaans because there is no past </v>
<v Speaker 1>tense.</v>

152
00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:09.920
<v Speaker 1>But this African sentence is similar to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Dutch perfect 10th sentence.</v>

153
00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:10.963
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>But notice that the way the past </v>

154
00:08:13.131 --> 00:08:14.930
<v Speaker 1>participle is formed is a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

155
00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.750
<v Speaker 1>Also notice that the form of the verb </v>
<v Speaker 1>for have is different.</v>

156
00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.790
<v Speaker 1>These are both the present tense form of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the verb,</v>

157
00:08:19.791 --> 00:08:23.570
<v Speaker 1>meaning to have the one in Dutchess </v>
<v Speaker 1>conjugated for first person singular,</v>

158
00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.390
<v Speaker 1>but Africans verbs don't change </v>
<v Speaker 1>according to person or a number.</v>

159
00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:28.610
<v Speaker 1>So the Dutch verb will change and other </v>
<v Speaker 1>sentences.</v>

160
00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:29.473
<v Speaker 1>But in Afrikaans it will always be hate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was also no plu perfect tents in </v>

161
00:08:33.561 --> 00:08:36.800
<v Speaker 1>Africans who perfect is like had watched</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead.</v>

162
00:08:36.801 --> 00:08:37.634
<v Speaker 1>The perfect form would be used.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's just jump into a few more </v>

163
00:08:39.921 --> 00:08:40.754
<v Speaker 1>examples,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sentences and look at these differences </v>

164
00:08:42.051 --> 00:08:42.884
<v Speaker 1>as well as some others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next sentences mean I talked to my </v>

165
00:08:45.111 --> 00:08:46.370
<v Speaker 1>children in Dutch.</v>

166
00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:49.580
<v Speaker 1>You kept mets men getting it into grouts</v>
<v Speaker 1>and an Afrikaans.</v>

167
00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:52.400
<v Speaker 1>I could fit my goodness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

168
00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:53.263
<v Speaker 1>notice the difference in personal </v>
<v Speaker 1>pronouns in Dutch and an Afrikaans and </v>

169
00:08:57.661 --> 00:08:58.494
<v Speaker 1>then notice the different forms of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>verb meaning to have the next word met </v>

170
00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:02.123
<v Speaker 1>means width.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And next we can see that the possessive </v>

171
00:09:03.901 --> 00:09:08.040
<v Speaker 1>pronouns are different in Dutch and an </v>
<v Speaker 1>Afrikaans May.</v>

172
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:09.233
<v Speaker 1>Next is the word for children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but notice that the plural form is </v>

173
00:09:11.641 --> 00:09:12.474
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Notice that the word order is exactly </v>

174
00:09:13.951 --> 00:09:17.100
<v Speaker 1>the same and that the second verb goes </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the end in Afrikaans,</v>

175
00:09:17.101 --> 00:09:19.890
<v Speaker 1>which is the same as in Dutch and also </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same as in German.</v>

176
00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.860
<v Speaker 1>The next sentences mean did you have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good new year?</v>

177
00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:27.950
<v Speaker 1>First in Dutch have gi hooten,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new hub and an Afrikaans and English.</v>

178
00:09:29.371 --> 00:09:32.550
<v Speaker 1>It's like have you a good new year?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Head again.</v>

179
00:09:32.551 --> 00:09:35.100
<v Speaker 1>We see the different forms of the verb </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning to have.</v>

180
00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.560
<v Speaker 1>Then we see the different spelling of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the personal pronoun.</v>

181
00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:38.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yay.</v>

182
00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:40.290
<v Speaker 1>Meaning you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then we have the indefinite article,</v>

183
00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:41.153
<v Speaker 1>which has been shortened in Afrikaans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then notice that the word for good is </v>

184
00:09:43.621 --> 00:09:45.000
<v Speaker 1>slightly different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then after that,</v>

185
00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:47.190
<v Speaker 1>notice the slight difference in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>words for a new year.</v>

186
00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:51.060
<v Speaker 1>And finally the past participle of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>verb meaning to have is the same in both</v>

187
00:09:51.061 --> 00:09:53.070
<v Speaker 1>sentences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now let's look at a similar sentence,</v>

188
00:09:53.071 --> 00:09:53.904
<v Speaker 1>but with a little change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This one means did he have a good new </v>

189
00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:57.820
<v Speaker 1>year in Dutch?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey Cy,</v>

190
00:09:57.821 --> 00:10:00.270
<v Speaker 1>a hoot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new Yamaha and an Afrikaans.</v>

191
00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:05.550
<v Speaker 1>Look at the first word and notice that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Dutch verb conjugation changes.</v>

192
00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:07.800
<v Speaker 1>This is the third person singular form </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the verb.</v>

193
00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:08.943
<v Speaker 1>The verb form stays the same in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Afrikaans and next we see that the </v>

194
00:10:10.951 --> 00:10:11.784
<v Speaker 1>personal pronoun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high e meaning he is spelled </v>

195
00:10:13.621 --> 00:10:14.670
<v Speaker 1>differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After that,</v>

196
00:10:14.671 --> 00:10:17.280
<v Speaker 1>the rest of the words are the same as in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sentence is up above.</v>

197
00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:21.570
<v Speaker 1>The next sentences mean we will live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We will die in Dutch,</v>

198
00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:22.860
<v Speaker 1>Missoula,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lavan,</v>

199
00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:24.270
<v Speaker 1>Zilla,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stephan,</v>

200
00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:29.570
<v Speaker 1>and in Afrikaans on Saul starbuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Notice here that the subject Pronoun for</v>

201
00:10:30.091 --> 00:10:32.860
<v Speaker 1>week is different in Dutch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the subject pronouns as va,</v>

202
00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:35.910
<v Speaker 1>but the object pronoun similar to us in </v>
<v Speaker 1>English,</v>

203
00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:40.170
<v Speaker 1>his aunts in Africans owns is both the </v>
<v Speaker 1>subject and the object Pronoun.</v>

204
00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.420
<v Speaker 1>Next,</v>
<v Speaker 1>notice that the future tense in Dutch is</v>

205
00:10:42.421 --> 00:10:45.570
<v Speaker 1>formed using Xulane plus the infinitive </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Afrikaans.</v>

206
00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:50.040
<v Speaker 1>It's formed by using sal plus the verb </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there really isn't an infinitive and</v>

207
00:10:50.041 --> 00:10:51.930
<v Speaker 1>Afrikaans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's just one single verb form.</v>

208
00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:54.390
<v Speaker 1>This part here is the same as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>present tense form,</v>

209
00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:58.500
<v Speaker 1>so we can see that there are some </v>
<v Speaker 1>differences between Dutch and Africans,</v>

210
00:10:58.501 --> 00:10:59.334
<v Speaker 1>but generally the vocabulary is very </v>
<v Speaker 1>similar and probably very easy to </v>

211
00:11:02.161 --> 00:11:02.994
<v Speaker 1>recognize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you're aware of those general </v>

212
00:11:04.111 --> 00:11:06.870
<v Speaker 1>differences and the word order is </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically the same.</v>

213
00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:10.440
<v Speaker 1>So how well can Dutch speakers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>African speakers understand each other?</v>

214
00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:12.720
<v Speaker 1>The answer to this question depends on </v>
<v Speaker 1>who you ask,</v>

215
00:11:12.721 --> 00:11:16.020
<v Speaker 1>but generally they seem to be mutually </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligible to a moderate level.</v>

216
00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:17.033
<v Speaker 1>With African speakers being able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand the Dutch better than Dutch </v>

217
00:11:19.741 --> 00:11:21.420
<v Speaker 1>speakers can understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Afrikaans,</v>

218
00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.180
<v Speaker 1>there are a couple of important factors </v>
<v Speaker 1>and intelligibility.</v>

219
00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:25.043
<v Speaker 1>One of them is accent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard from a few Dutch people and </v>

220
00:11:27.211 --> 00:11:30.690
<v Speaker 1>from a few Africans people that they can</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand certain speakers of the other</v>

221
00:11:30.691 --> 00:11:31.524
<v Speaker 1>language very well but other speakers </v>
<v Speaker 1>are a partner to understand and that </v>

222
00:11:34.561 --> 00:11:35.394
<v Speaker 1>might be because certain Dutch dialects </v>
<v Speaker 1>have pronunciation that is more similar </v>

223
00:11:38.191 --> 00:11:39.024
<v Speaker 1>to Africans than others and there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>also a lot of second language speakers </v>

224
00:11:41.851 --> 00:11:42.684
<v Speaker 1>of Afrikaans who's accent might be </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult for native Dutch speakers to </v>

225
00:11:45.181 --> 00:11:46.014
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another factor is register register </v>

226
00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:48.543
<v Speaker 1>means the level of formality used.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now if the speakers of both languages </v>

227
00:11:51.301 --> 00:11:52.134
<v Speaker 1>use the standard formal variety of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>language and they don't use any local </v>

228
00:11:55.271 --> 00:11:56.104
<v Speaker 1>variations or slang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they'll probably understand each </v>

229
00:11:57.791 --> 00:11:58.600
<v Speaker 1>other much better.</v>

230
00:11:58.600 --> 00:11:59.433
<v Speaker 1>Formal speech basically resembles the </v>
<v Speaker 1>written language and the speakers of </v>

231
00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:04.750
<v Speaker 1>either language can basically understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other one when it's written.</v>

232
00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:08.710
<v Speaker 1>A common question that I see written on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Internet is should I learn Afrikaans</v>

233
00:12:08.711 --> 00:12:09.544
<v Speaker 1>before learning Dutch?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would that help me to learn Dutch later </v>

234
00:12:11.621 --> 00:12:12.454
<v Speaker 1>on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say that that's probably a bad </v>

235
00:12:14.171 --> 00:12:17.350
<v Speaker 1>idea to learn afrikaans just because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to learn Dutch later,</v>

236
00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:18.363
<v Speaker 1>it's probably would end up confusing you</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you learn Dutch later on because </v>

237
00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:23.830
<v Speaker 1>Dutch is similar to Africans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but more complex.</v>

238
00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:24.753
<v Speaker 1>I would say that the best reason to </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn Afrikaans would be because you </v>

239
00:12:26.651 --> 00:12:27.484
<v Speaker 1>have a deep cultural interest in South </v>
<v Speaker 1>Africa and you want to spend some time </v>

240
00:12:30.161 --> 00:12:30.994
<v Speaker 1>in that country or in Namibia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the question of the day for speakers </v>

241
00:12:33.941 --> 00:12:34.774
<v Speaker 1>of Africans and Dutch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how well can you guys understand each </v>

242
00:12:36.941 --> 00:12:39.040
<v Speaker 1>other?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leave your comments and your experiences</v>

243
00:12:39.041 --> 00:12:40.870
<v Speaker 1>down below.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for everyone else,</v>

244
00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:42.363
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a question of the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why don't you ask a question to the </v>

245
00:12:44.531 --> 00:12:46.690
<v Speaker 1>Africans and Dutch speakers?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sounds good.</v>

246
00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:49.030
<v Speaker 1>Be sure to follow lane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>focus on facebook,</v>

247
00:12:49.031 --> 00:12:50.410
