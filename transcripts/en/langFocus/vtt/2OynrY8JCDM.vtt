00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:01.693
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and </v>

2
00:00:03.361 --> 00:00:06.420
<v Speaker 1>my name is Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today I'm going to answer the question,</v>

3
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.313
<v Speaker 1>is English really a Germanic language?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you've seen any of my videos on </v>

4
00:00:10.711 --> 00:00:13.020
<v Speaker 1>Germanic languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like my Afrikaans video,</v>

5
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:13.883
<v Speaker 1>like my Dutch video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like my German video or like my north </v>

6
00:00:16.091 --> 00:00:16.924
<v Speaker 1>dramatic languages video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you probably saw that English is </v>

7
00:00:19.381 --> 00:00:22.380
<v Speaker 1>also a Germanic language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of people write comments,</v>

8
00:00:22.381 --> 00:00:24.750
<v Speaker 1>expressing some confusion over this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They write things like,</v>

9
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.790
<v Speaker 1>Paul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you sure it's a Germanic language?</v>

10
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.620
<v Speaker 1>Are you sure it's not a romance </v>
<v Speaker 1>language?</v>

11
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.610
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good question.</v>

12
00:00:29.611 --> 00:00:32.760
<v Speaker 1>If a native English speaker who had </v>
<v Speaker 1>never learned another language before,</v>

13
00:00:32.761 --> 00:00:36.480
<v Speaker 1>had to look at a page of French and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>had a look at a page of German or Dutch,</v>

14
00:00:36.481 --> 00:00:39.900
<v Speaker 1>they would probably be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand more of the page of French or</v>

15
00:00:39.901 --> 00:00:42.420
<v Speaker 1>if they had to look at a page of Spanish</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a page of Italian,</v>

16
00:00:42.421 --> 00:00:45.420
<v Speaker 1>they would probably be able to pick out </v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of words that they recognize,</v>

17
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.313
<v Speaker 1>but on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they looked at a page of Dutch or </v>

18
00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:48.714
<v Speaker 1>German,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they probably wouldn't be able to pick </v>

19
00:00:49.711 --> 00:00:52.500
<v Speaker 1>out as many without deciphering the </v>
<v Speaker 1>words a little bit first.</v>

20
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:53.483
<v Speaker 1>So in that case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is English a Germanic language and </v>

21
00:00:54.991 --> 00:00:57.810
<v Speaker 1>not a romance language in the field of </v>
<v Speaker 1>linguistics?</v>

22
00:00:57.811 --> 00:01:01.140
<v Speaker 1>Languages are categorized according to </v>
<v Speaker 1>their genetic relationship.</v>

23
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.003
<v Speaker 1>Genetic relationship means that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a common ancestor and therefore </v>

24
00:01:04.801 --> 00:01:05.634
<v Speaker 1>they have some common features that </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinguish them from other groups of </v>

25
00:01:07.741 --> 00:01:08.574
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This type of genetic relationship </v>

26
00:01:10.171 --> 00:01:11.004
<v Speaker 1>between languages can commonly be seen </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the grammar and syntax of the </v>

27
00:01:13.561 --> 00:01:14.394
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the current vocabulary of the </v>

28
00:01:15.781 --> 00:01:19.050
<v Speaker 1>language is not really taken into </v>
<v Speaker 1>account in its categorization.</v>

29
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.093
<v Speaker 1>Even when a language has a huge number </v>
<v Speaker 1>of loan words and it's vocabulary </v>

30
00:01:22.741 --> 00:01:23.574
<v Speaker 1>changes a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That does not change the categorization </v>

31
00:01:25.411 --> 00:01:26.244
<v Speaker 1>of that language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So because English developed from Provo </v>

32
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.150
<v Speaker 1>Germanic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is a Germanic language,</v>

33
00:01:30.151 --> 00:01:33.240
<v Speaker 1>despite massive changes that have taken </v>
<v Speaker 1>place in its vocabulary.</v>

34
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.720
<v Speaker 1>The vocabulary of English has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>highly influenced by romance languages.</v>

35
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.930
<v Speaker 1>Romance meaning Latin in any language </v>
<v Speaker 1>that has developed from Latin,</v>

36
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:40.980
<v Speaker 1>like French,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spanish,</v>

37
00:01:40.981 --> 00:01:41.910
<v Speaker 1>Italian cetera.</v>

38
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.790
<v Speaker 1>So how much has it been influenced?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

39
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:50.120
<v Speaker 1>English vocabulary is 26 percent </v>
<v Speaker 1>Germanic and it's 29 percent French.</v>

40
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:51.413
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're telling me that there's more </v>

41
00:01:52.291 --> 00:01:53.124
<v Speaker 1>French vocabulary than Germanic </v>
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary even though it's a Germanic </v>

42
00:01:55.591 --> 00:01:56.550
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all.</v>

43
00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:57.241
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but wait,</v>

44
00:01:57.241 --> 00:02:00.120
<v Speaker 1>there's also 29 percent Latin </v>
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary.</v>

45
00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.013
<v Speaker 1>So that means together 58 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 1>English vocabulary comes from romance </v>

46
00:02:04.111 --> 00:02:05.010
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

47
00:02:05.011 --> 00:02:08.190
<v Speaker 1>That's more than I thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another six percent comes from Greek.</v>

48
00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.153
<v Speaker 1>Another four percent comes from other </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages in four percent comes from </v>

49
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.593
<v Speaker 1>proper names.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't really think of any vocabulary </v>

50
00:02:14.731 --> 00:02:17.880
<v Speaker 1>that comes from proper names aside from </v>
<v Speaker 1>randy.</v>

51
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.073
<v Speaker 1>So if we ignore the origins of English </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's grammar and syntax and just </v>

52
00:02:21.811 --> 00:02:22.644
<v Speaker 1>focus on the vocabulary for a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then English is largely a romance </v>

53
00:02:25.501 --> 00:02:28.110
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did so much romance vocabulary enter</v>

54
00:02:28.111 --> 00:02:28.944
<v Speaker 1>English?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Much of the French vocabulary entered </v>

55
00:02:30.421 --> 00:02:33.180
<v Speaker 1>English after the Norman conquest of 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>66.</v>

56
00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.053
<v Speaker 1>The Norman spoke of regional French </v>
<v Speaker 1>dialect called old Norman or Norman </v>

57
00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:40.403
<v Speaker 1>French.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The upper classes in England spoke </v>

58
00:02:41.221 --> 00:02:42.054
<v Speaker 1>French for around 300 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>English was influenced by the Norman </v>

59
00:02:44.761 --> 00:02:45.594
<v Speaker 1>French dialect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also by Parisian French due to its </v>

60
00:02:47.581 --> 00:02:50.280
<v Speaker 1>prestige and cultural influence in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>following centuries,</v>

61
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.450
<v Speaker 1>huge amounts of French vocabulary </v>
<v Speaker 1>entered English and had lost much of its</v>

62
00:02:54.451 --> 00:02:55.284
<v Speaker 1>old English vocabulary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in many cases there are pairs of </v>

63
00:02:57.151 --> 00:02:59.410
<v Speaker 1>equivalent Germanic and French </v>
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary,</v>

64
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.393
<v Speaker 1>but within those pairs there's often a </v>
<v Speaker 1>slightly different meaning or usage for </v>

65
00:03:02.741 --> 00:03:04.420
<v Speaker 1>the Germanic word and for the French </v>
<v Speaker 1>word,</v>

66
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:05.283
<v Speaker 1>an interesting example or the pairs of </v>
<v Speaker 1>words representing animals versus foods </v>

67
00:03:08.561 --> 00:03:09.394
<v Speaker 1>that come from those animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The animals are represented by dramatic </v>

68
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.110
<v Speaker 1>words and the foods are represented by </v>
<v Speaker 1>French loan words.</v>

69
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.270
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cow comes from old English coop,</v>

70
00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.780
<v Speaker 1>but beef comes from French.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pig comes from old English,</v>

71
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.450
<v Speaker 1>picked up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but pork comes from French Paul,</v>

72
00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.940
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know what the pronunciation </v>
<v Speaker 1>would have been like in Norman.</v>

73
00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.480
<v Speaker 1>French chief comes from old English </v>
<v Speaker 1>shop,</v>

74
00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.720
<v Speaker 1>but mutton comes from old French and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>

75
00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.120
<v Speaker 1>Snail comes from old English Snyder and </v>
<v Speaker 1>escargo comes from Norman French.</v>

76
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.033
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] French also influenced </v>
<v Speaker 1>English because of its huge cultural </v>

77
00:03:37.931 --> 00:03:38.764
<v Speaker 1>influence on Europe from the renaissance</v>
<v Speaker 1>period to the end of the 19th century </v>

78
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.320
<v Speaker 1>and even now to some extent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not just French.</v>

79
00:03:44.321 --> 00:03:48.130
<v Speaker 1>There's also a lot of Latin vocabulary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some Latin enter Germanic dialects.</v>

80
00:03:48.131 --> 00:03:50.500
<v Speaker 1>In the early days through contact with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Roman Empire.</v>

81
00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.780
<v Speaker 1>On top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some Christian missionaries were present</v>

82
00:03:52.781 --> 00:03:54.700
<v Speaker 1>in Britain and the sixth and seventh </v>
<v Speaker 1>centuries,</v>

83
00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.430
<v Speaker 1>and they introduced some Latin religious</v>
<v Speaker 1>vocab into English.</v>

84
00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:58.323
<v Speaker 1>Many Latin words were also borrowed </v>
<v Speaker 1>during the renaissance period and also </v>

85
00:04:00.671 --> 00:04:01.504
<v Speaker 1>during the scientific revolution of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>17th and 18th centuries were many new </v>

86
00:04:04.721 --> 00:04:06.020
<v Speaker 1>words were coined,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coining,</v>

87
00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.530
<v Speaker 1>demeaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>newly created new words were coined from</v>

88
00:04:08.531 --> 00:04:09.364
<v Speaker 1>Latin roots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>prefixes and suffixes to represent new </v>

89
00:04:11.261 --> 00:04:13.960
<v Speaker 1>concepts in science and technology and </v>
<v Speaker 1>an industry.</v>

90
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:15.003
<v Speaker 1>So English is a Germanic language which </v>
<v Speaker 1>absorbed a huge number of French and </v>

91
00:04:17.651 --> 00:04:18.850
<v Speaker 1>Latin words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

92
00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.280
<v Speaker 1>basically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But some people have a different theory.</v>

93
00:04:21.281 --> 00:04:24.190
<v Speaker 1>Some people think that English is </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually a creole language.</v>

94
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.070
<v Speaker 1>There's something called the middle </v>
<v Speaker 1>English creole hypothesis.</v>

95
00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.340
<v Speaker 1>There are big differences between old </v>
<v Speaker 1>English and middle English.</v>

96
00:04:30.341 --> 00:04:33.370
<v Speaker 1>Of course there was the importing of </v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of French vocabulary,</v>

97
00:04:33.371 --> 00:04:35.680
<v Speaker 1>but that alone does not make it a creole</v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

98
00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:36.633
<v Speaker 1>But there were other changes to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>grammar of English which became highly </v>

99
00:04:38.741 --> 00:04:41.020
<v Speaker 1>simplified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a lot of simplification,</v>

100
00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.390
<v Speaker 1>like the loss of most now in cases and </v>
<v Speaker 1>gender,</v>

101
00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:47.410
<v Speaker 1>so that aside from the possessive form </v>
<v Speaker 1>with apostrophe s and the plural forms,</v>

102
00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.810
<v Speaker 1>most nouns in English don't have any </v>
<v Speaker 1>inflection.</v>

103
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.970
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>adjectives used to have inflection,</v>

104
00:04:51.971 --> 00:04:52.804
<v Speaker 1>but that disappeared to the word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Inflection means changes to a word to </v>

105
00:04:55.721 --> 00:04:57.790
<v Speaker 1>represent different grammatical </v>
<v Speaker 1>categories.</v>

106
00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.550
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the word cat and the cat's paw here,</v>

107
00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.550
<v Speaker 1>the apostrophe s is a kind of inflection</v>
<v Speaker 1>to show possession.</v>

108
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:04.503
<v Speaker 1>And we have one most but two mice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here the word is inflected to show </v>

109
00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:08.673
<v Speaker 1>plural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's take a simple phrase like the </v>

110
00:05:10.931 --> 00:05:13.630
<v Speaker 1>good king and look at it in old English,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in old English.</v>

111
00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:14.493
<v Speaker 1>Notice that all three words in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>phrase can change in the nominative </v>

112
00:05:16.901 --> 00:05:19.840
<v Speaker 1>case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say Gold Cuny in the accusative case,</v>

113
00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.600
<v Speaker 1>thrown a golden human in the genitive </v>
<v Speaker 1>case.</v>

114
00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.990
<v Speaker 1>Fast golden keuning is in the date of </v>
<v Speaker 1>case Fem,</v>

115
00:05:25.991 --> 00:05:26.824
<v Speaker 1>golden tuning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the definite article changes the </v>

116
00:05:28.691 --> 00:05:31.630
<v Speaker 1>adjective changes and the noun changes </v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on the case,</v>

117
00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:32.553
<v Speaker 1>but the article and adjective also </v>
<v Speaker 1>changed depending on the gender and the </v>

118
00:05:34.961 --> 00:05:36.880
<v Speaker 1>case endings are different depending on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the gender.</v>

119
00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.890
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at a similar phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the good Queen Sale.</v>

120
00:05:39.891 --> 00:05:40.724
<v Speaker 1>Goal Day Quinn thought gold on Quinn </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought a go down Quinn and thought I'd </v>

121
00:05:44.191 --> 00:05:45.024
<v Speaker 1>go down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quinn,</v>

122
00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.490
<v Speaker 1>notice the different feminine form of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the definite article and the adjective.</v>

123
00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.630
<v Speaker 1>This is just an example of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>grammatical complexity of old English.</v>

124
00:05:52.631 --> 00:05:56.050
<v Speaker 1>So you can imagine how much it became </v>
<v Speaker 1>simplified by the middle English period.</v>

125
00:05:56.051 --> 00:05:58.850
<v Speaker 1>Most of these farms disappeared or </v>
<v Speaker 1>merged together.</v>

126
00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:02.270
<v Speaker 1>Now we just have a genitive case and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>others form a common case.</v>

127
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:05.390
<v Speaker 1>This is the type of simplification that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens when creoles arise.</v>

128
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:06.283
<v Speaker 1>So it's very possible that old English </v>
<v Speaker 1>underwent a process of creolization </v>

129
00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:10.243
<v Speaker 1>inserting lots of French vocabulary into</v>
<v Speaker 1>an old English substrate or underlying </v>

130
00:06:14.241 --> 00:06:15.074
<v Speaker 1>structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there might have been a different </v>

131
00:06:15.951 --> 00:06:17.660
<v Speaker 1>reason for that simplification of </v>
<v Speaker 1>English.</v>

132
00:06:17.661 --> 00:06:21.140
<v Speaker 1>Some people don't believe in the creole </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis and they point to things like</v>

133
00:06:21.141 --> 00:06:23.810
<v Speaker 1>some of the irregular forms that still </v>
<v Speaker 1>exist in English,</v>

134
00:06:23.811 --> 00:06:26.330
<v Speaker 1>like irregular verbs or irregular plural</v>
<v Speaker 1>forms.</v>

135
00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:29.660
<v Speaker 1>In a typical creole language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those forms would have been regularized,</v>

136
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:33.230
<v Speaker 1>but of course creolization is not an all</v>
<v Speaker 1>or nothing process.</v>

137
00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:35.900
<v Speaker 1>It's possible that English was partially</v>
<v Speaker 1>realized.</v>

138
00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:36.883
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's look at a couple of sentences in </v>

139
00:06:38.061 --> 00:06:40.370
<v Speaker 1>English and let's look at the influences</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can find.</v>

140
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:43.250
<v Speaker 1>Let's see if there's more dramatic or </v>
<v Speaker 1>more romance influence.</v>

141
00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:44.143
<v Speaker 1>This one's a newspaper headline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump pushing immigration plan meets </v>

142
00:06:46.761 --> 00:06:49.070
<v Speaker 1>with family of women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>killed in 2007.</v>

143
00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:51.170
<v Speaker 1>Push.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This word comes from old French,</v>

144
00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:54.320
<v Speaker 1>pulled say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or modern French poussey immigration.</v>

145
00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.500
<v Speaker 1>This word comes from Latin [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good optimum plan.</v>

146
00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:01.850
<v Speaker 1>This word comes from the French word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means map or ground plan meet.</v>

147
00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:02.743
<v Speaker 1>This comes from old English,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mayton with this comes from old English </v>

148
00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:06.313
<v Speaker 1>with family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This comes from the Latin Familia </v>

149
00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:11.390
<v Speaker 1>according to the source I used,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's also the French word for me,</v>

150
00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:15.020
<v Speaker 1>which I suppose could be the source of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this word comes from the old English,</v>

151
00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:17.960
<v Speaker 1>F or off woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This comes from old English.</v>

152
00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:19.940
<v Speaker 1>We men or women kill.</v>

153
00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:23.270
<v Speaker 1>This might come from the old English </v>
<v Speaker 1>Quillan to quell in.</v>

154
00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:26.450
<v Speaker 1>This word comes from Latin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so out of those 10 words,</v>

155
00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.000
<v Speaker 1>five are dramatic and five are romance </v>
<v Speaker 1>words,</v>

156
00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:30.583
<v Speaker 1>but let's have a look at a more casual </v>
<v Speaker 1>sentence because I have a feeling that </v>

157
00:07:32.901 --> 00:07:33.734
<v Speaker 1>newspaper vocabulary tends towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>romance vocabulary more than common </v>

158
00:07:36.831 --> 00:07:37.664
<v Speaker 1>speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had lunch with my friend and we read </v>

159
00:07:38.841 --> 00:07:40.850
<v Speaker 1>some books I have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is dramatic.</v>

160
00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:43.220
<v Speaker 1>Comes from old English.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Each had.</v>

161
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:45.590
<v Speaker 1>This is also dramatic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It comes from old English,</v>

162
00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:48.590
<v Speaker 1>have been lunch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The origin of this one is vague,</v>

163
00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:50.930
<v Speaker 1>but it seems to be from a modern English</v>
<v Speaker 1>dialect.</v>

164
00:07:50.931 --> 00:07:53.750
<v Speaker 1>Word with this is from old English with </v>
<v Speaker 1>mine.</v>

165
00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:54.613
<v Speaker 1>This is dramatic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It comes from middle English or means </v>

166
00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:58.333
<v Speaker 1>friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This comes from old English phrase and </v>

167
00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:02.680
<v Speaker 1>this comes from old English,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ond,</v>

168
00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:05.480
<v Speaker 1>or owned we.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This comes from old English way.</v>

169
00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:08.060
<v Speaker 1>Read this comes from old English at that</v>
<v Speaker 1>done,</v>

170
00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:09.270
<v Speaker 1>or they've done some.</v>

171
00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:13.220
<v Speaker 1>This comes from old English book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This comes from old English book,</v>

172
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:17.000
<v Speaker 1>so this time all of the words are almost</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of the words are Germanic,</v>

173
00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:17.983
<v Speaker 1>so it's interesting that the majority of</v>
<v Speaker 1>English vocabulary comes from French or </v>

174
00:08:20.601 --> 00:08:21.434
<v Speaker 1>from Latin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the most commonly used words in </v>

175
00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:24.513
<v Speaker 1>casual speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there tends to be more dramatic </v>

176
00:08:26.031 --> 00:08:26.864
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary and this is a good argument </v>
<v Speaker 1>in favor of English being classified as </v>

177
00:08:29.991 --> 00:08:30.824
<v Speaker 1>a Germanic language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So do I think that English should be </v>

178
00:08:32.661 --> 00:08:34.550
<v Speaker 1>classified as a Germanic language?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

179
00:08:34.551 --> 00:08:36.680
<v Speaker 1>by a linguists criteria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

180
00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:39.770
<v Speaker 1>but most people don't really care about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the linguists criteria.</v>

181
00:08:39.771 --> 00:08:41.830
<v Speaker 1>They just care about the practical </v>
<v Speaker 1>application,</v>

182
00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:42.683
<v Speaker 1>the practical use of the language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in practice I think the vocabulary </v>

183
00:08:45.411 --> 00:08:47.180
<v Speaker 1>is a very important element of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

184
00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:51.130
<v Speaker 1>So I think it's fair to say that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>practice English as a hybrid language,</v>

185
00:08:51.131 --> 00:08:53.120
<v Speaker 1>it's partly Germanic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly romance,</v>

186
00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:55.070
<v Speaker 1>but that's my personal conclusion.</v>

187
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:55.943
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to know what you think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that English should be </v>

188
00:08:57.541 --> 00:08:58.374
<v Speaker 1>considered a Germanic language or do you</v>
<v Speaker 1>think it seems more like a romance </v>

189
00:09:00.991 --> 00:09:01.824
<v Speaker 1>language?</v>
