00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.150
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Lange focus channel.</v>

2
00:00:03.151 --> 00:00:03.984
<v Speaker 1>My name is Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today we are going to talk about </v>

3
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.500
<v Speaker 1>language learning edge number four and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is focus.</v>

4
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:11.543
<v Speaker 1>Focus comes first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people who really get into </v>

5
00:00:13.981 --> 00:00:16.500
<v Speaker 1>learning languages as a passion and as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>hobby,</v>

6
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.240
<v Speaker 1>they have a certain weakness and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>weakness is that they are visionary,</v>

7
00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.223
<v Speaker 1>they are too visionary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have too many new ideas all the </v>

8
00:00:24.931 --> 00:00:25.764
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>too many things that they want to try </v>

9
00:00:27.421 --> 00:00:30.570
<v Speaker 1>too many things that they want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Too many things that they want to create</v>

10
00:00:30.571 --> 00:00:33.150
<v Speaker 1>sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now in some ways that's awesome.</v>

11
00:00:33.151 --> 00:00:33.984
<v Speaker 1>That's very good for being creative and </v>
<v Speaker 1>for getting new ideas and setting new </v>

12
00:00:36.751 --> 00:00:39.900
<v Speaker 1>goals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it can also be a distraction because</v>

13
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.410
<v Speaker 1>it's difficult to focus on one thing for</v>
<v Speaker 1>a long enough to achieve it.</v>

14
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.780
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you start to learn French,</v>

15
00:00:45.781 --> 00:00:46.614
<v Speaker 1>but then you read a little bit about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other romance languages and you want to </v>

16
00:00:49.261 --> 00:00:51.360
<v Speaker 1>start studying Italian or Spanish or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

17
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.310
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're learning Arabic and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

18
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.173
<v Speaker 1>hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be interesting to learn Hebrew </v>

19
00:00:55.141 --> 00:00:55.974
<v Speaker 1>too and see how they're related.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's very easy to get sidetracked </v>

20
00:00:59.101 --> 00:01:02.940
<v Speaker 1>from the language that you want to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>focusing on at the moment.</v>

21
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.073
<v Speaker 1>If you really think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who gets good at new skills the most </v>

22
00:01:06.841 --> 00:01:07.674
<v Speaker 1>quickly?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably people who get really </v>

23
00:01:09.121 --> 00:01:09.954
<v Speaker 1>obsessed with that skill are really </v>
<v Speaker 1>obsessed with learning and practicing </v>

24
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.433
<v Speaker 1>around that topic and that's because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're dedicating so much of their </v>

25
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.470
<v Speaker 1>mental resources to that skill or to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that topic.</v>

26
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:20.573
<v Speaker 1>You might think that if you study French</v>
<v Speaker 1>for one hour that that's the same as </v>

27
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.120
<v Speaker 1>studying French for one hour plus </v>
<v Speaker 1>Spanish for one hour.</v>

28
00:01:27.121 --> 00:01:30.300
<v Speaker 1>Like you will be learning the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of French in both scenarios.</v>

29
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.223
<v Speaker 1>But I would say that that's not true and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's because a lot of the learning </v>

30
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.450
<v Speaker 1>takes place when you're not studying.</v>

31
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.283
<v Speaker 1>It takes place in the background.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Subconsciously you're processing and </v>

32
00:01:40.141 --> 00:01:40.974
<v Speaker 1>you're synthesizing all the things </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've studied in the background while </v>

33
00:01:43.081 --> 00:01:45.180
<v Speaker 1>you're going about your day and doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>other things.</v>

34
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.390
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes if you are in tune with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of inner voice,</v>

35
00:01:48.391 --> 00:01:50.370
<v Speaker 1>you can notice that you'll notice in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>background,</v>

36
00:01:50.371 --> 00:01:51.204
<v Speaker 1>your mind is making sentences in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>language while you're driving or while </v>

37
00:01:53.881 --> 00:01:56.400
<v Speaker 1>you're on the train or while you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking to someone you can,</v>

38
00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:57.443
<v Speaker 1>you can be aware of some of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>processing going on so that learning is </v>

39
00:02:01.021 --> 00:02:05.280
<v Speaker 1>taking place when you're not studying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you are focusing on two different</v>

40
00:02:05.281 --> 00:02:06.114
<v Speaker 1>languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're studying Spanish for one hour </v>

41
00:02:07.501 --> 00:02:09.750
<v Speaker 1>a day and you're studying French for one</v>
<v Speaker 1>hour a day,</v>

42
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:10.793
<v Speaker 1>then that subconscious background </v>
<v Speaker 1>processes being divided between two </v>

43
00:02:13.951 --> 00:02:14.784
<v Speaker 1>different languages so you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting as much of that growth going on </v>

44
00:02:17.761 --> 00:02:18.594
<v Speaker 1>in the background.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you dedicate the same amount of </v>

45
00:02:20.551 --> 00:02:22.350
<v Speaker 1>study times to that language.</v>

46
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.490
<v Speaker 1>So the most efficient way to learn one </v>
<v Speaker 1>language really well is to focus on that</v>

47
00:02:26.491 --> 00:02:28.950
<v Speaker 1>language and that language alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

48
00:02:28.951 --> 00:02:31.860
<v Speaker 1>how do you do that if you're one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those visionary people who get all those</v>

49
00:02:31.861 --> 00:02:32.694
<v Speaker 1>ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you kind of manage all the ideas </v>

50
00:02:34.831 --> 00:02:35.664
<v Speaker 1>and all the goals that you have where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to kind of get used to pushing </v>

51
00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:41.370
<v Speaker 1>certain goals?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Often to the distance into the future,</v>

52
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.850
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't think of pushing them aside </v>
<v Speaker 1>or putting them behind you.</v>

53
00:02:44.851 --> 00:02:46.890
<v Speaker 1>I would think of putting them off into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the future.</v>

54
00:02:46.891 --> 00:02:50.070
<v Speaker 1>So after you finish achieving this </v>
<v Speaker 1>current goal right now,</v>

55
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.933
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting really good at French in the </v>

56
00:02:52.951 --> 00:02:54.150
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beyond that,</v>

57
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.100
<v Speaker 1>you can see the next goal in front of </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

58
00:02:56.101 --> 00:02:59.950
<v Speaker 1>which is to start learning Spanish or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever your language of interest.</v>

59
00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.260
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But just think of it like that.</v>

60
00:03:02.261 --> 00:03:06.250
<v Speaker 1>Like you're not discarding those goals </v>
<v Speaker 1>are discarding those missions you were,</v>

61
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.730
<v Speaker 1>you were kind of putting them off into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the future and you'll get to them later.</v>

62
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:10.773
<v Speaker 1>But your primary mission right now is </v>
<v Speaker 1>this one which you need to accomplish </v>

63
00:03:13.511 --> 00:03:16.000
<v Speaker 1>first before you can get to that future </v>
<v Speaker 1>mission.</v>

64
00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.490
<v Speaker 1>So I've been talking about focus in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>grand sense,</v>

65
00:03:18.491 --> 00:03:21.280
<v Speaker 1>like in terms of your large goals and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of thing.</v>

66
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.233
<v Speaker 1>But of course focus is also important in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the moment because we live in such a </v>

67
00:03:25.421 --> 00:03:26.254
<v Speaker 1>distraction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>prawn world with the Internet and with </v>

68
00:03:28.121 --> 00:03:30.490
<v Speaker 1>smartphones and with email and all those</v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

69
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:31.503
<v Speaker 1>there's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so much distraction all around </v>

70
00:03:33.161 --> 00:03:36.610
<v Speaker 1>you all the time that it's difficult to </v>
<v Speaker 1>focus on the task at hand.</v>

71
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.320
<v Speaker 1>Even if you have put all of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>secondary goal is often to the future,</v>

72
00:03:41.321 --> 00:03:42.154
<v Speaker 1>just focusing on your primary goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can be tough just on a day by day </v>

73
00:03:45.101 --> 00:03:47.320
<v Speaker 1>basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all have our different weaknesses.</v>

74
00:03:47.321 --> 00:03:48.154
<v Speaker 1>Some people get caught up in facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people like me get caught up in </v>

75
00:03:51.401 --> 00:03:52.234
<v Speaker 1>youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I get caught up in all of the </v>

76
00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.000
<v Speaker 1>videos in the sidebar.</v>

77
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.833
<v Speaker 1>I'll end up watching 20 videos when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>planned to just watch one and that kind </v>

78
00:03:58.631 --> 00:04:01.300
<v Speaker 1>of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's really easy to get off track and</v>

79
00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.880
<v Speaker 1>lose focus of what your goal is for that</v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

80
00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.550
<v Speaker 1>So it's important to not leave it to </v>
<v Speaker 1>willpower.</v>

81
00:04:06.551 --> 00:04:07.384
<v Speaker 1>It's important to have some strategies </v>
<v Speaker 1>in place and make some decisions that </v>

82
00:04:09.731 --> 00:04:12.730
<v Speaker 1>will help guide your behavior when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to get something done.</v>

83
00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.863
<v Speaker 1>Avoiding distractions and staying </v>
<v Speaker 1>focused is a little different for </v>

84
00:04:15.821 --> 00:04:16.654
<v Speaker 1>everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'll give you a couple of things </v>

85
00:04:17.831 --> 00:04:19.930
<v Speaker 1>that I used to deal with these </v>
<v Speaker 1>situations.</v>

86
00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:23.080
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you have some other ideas that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can share in the comments.</v>

87
00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:24.123
<v Speaker 1>One of my strategies for avoiding </v>
<v Speaker 1>distractions is that I have a kind of </v>

88
00:04:26.831 --> 00:04:27.664
<v Speaker 1>transition activity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a one kind of study or one kind of </v>

89
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.080
<v Speaker 1>study method that I find enjoyable </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really easy for me to get started</v>

90
00:04:35.081 --> 00:04:38.500
<v Speaker 1>at that I don't hesitate or </v>
<v Speaker 1>procrastinate when starting,</v>

91
00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.500
<v Speaker 1>and that's kind of my stepping stone </v>
<v Speaker 1>into studying.</v>

92
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.610
<v Speaker 1>So for me that is listening passively to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the news in my target language.</v>

93
00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.290
<v Speaker 1>I really enjoy that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's relaxing,</v>

94
00:04:47.291 --> 00:04:48.124
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of meditative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can just sit there and just commonly </v>

95
00:04:50.111 --> 00:04:54.710
<v Speaker 1>listen and that's an easy way for me to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get into that language is mode.</v>

96
00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:56.980
<v Speaker 1>So if I'm listening to French on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>news,</v>

97
00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.770
<v Speaker 1>I can sit there and relax,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then I start to notice words.</v>

98
00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:00.311
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

99
00:05:00.311 --> 00:05:01.144
<v Speaker 1>what does that word mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'll pick up my dictionary and look </v>

100
00:05:02.801 --> 00:05:03.634
<v Speaker 1>it up and I'll start to get curious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll start to get into French study </v>

101
00:05:06.251 --> 00:05:08.770
<v Speaker 1>mode.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then after that I'm going to pick up</v>

102
00:05:08.771 --> 00:05:12.130
<v Speaker 1>my books and I'm going to start studying</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then that kind of thing will happen.</v>

103
00:05:12.131 --> 00:05:12.964
<v Speaker 1>I'll transition into studying French </v>
<v Speaker 1>through that easy activity that I enjoy </v>

104
00:05:16.541 --> 00:05:19.780
<v Speaker 1>doing and that's kind of a low </v>
<v Speaker 1>investment activity for me.</v>

105
00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:21.660
<v Speaker 1>So maybe that's something you can try </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

106
00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:24.610
<v Speaker 1>If you really like listening to songs in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your target language,</v>

107
00:05:24.611 --> 00:05:25.444
<v Speaker 1>that can be your transition into </v>
<v Speaker 1>studying or if you really just like </v>

108
00:05:29.021 --> 00:05:29.854
<v Speaker 1>talking to people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you can go on facebook and chat </v>

109
00:05:31.451 --> 00:05:33.010
<v Speaker 1>with some native speakers in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>

110
00:05:33.011 --> 00:05:36.070
<v Speaker 1>leave some comments in that language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just getting that interaction,</v>

111
00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:37.083
<v Speaker 1>but whatever it is for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of low commitment and easy </v>

112
00:05:39.341 --> 00:05:42.520
<v Speaker 1>to get started with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but is in your target language.</v>

113
00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.160
<v Speaker 1>That's a good way to transition into </v>
<v Speaker 1>studying.</v>

114
00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.060
<v Speaker 1>Another important thing is to actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>physically block out distractions.</v>

115
00:05:49.061 --> 00:05:51.540
<v Speaker 1>Like sometimes I pick up my phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my smartphone,</v>

116
00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:55.300
<v Speaker 1>and I put it in the other room so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it won't be distracting to me.</v>

117
00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:59.030
<v Speaker 1>I always have the ringer turned off and </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I'm focusing on studying,</v>

118
00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.360
<v Speaker 1>I'll turn off all of the notifications </v>
<v Speaker 1>like no facebook notifications,</v>

119
00:06:02.361 --> 00:06:05.300
<v Speaker 1>no line APP notifications,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing like that.</v>

120
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:06.793
<v Speaker 1>But sometimes I'll still be interested </v>
<v Speaker 1>in picking up my phone in and checking </v>

121
00:06:09.831 --> 00:06:10.664
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if I want to avoid that I'll just </v>

122
00:06:11.691 --> 00:06:13.250
<v Speaker 1>pick it up and put it in the other room.</v>

123
00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:16.340
<v Speaker 1>So it's kind of a hassle to get up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>go do that.</v>

124
00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:17.263
<v Speaker 1>The benefit of actually picking up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>phone is not as big as the hassle of </v>

125
00:06:20.331 --> 00:06:21.164
<v Speaker 1>going to get it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's good to sometimes just remove </v>

126
00:06:23.241 --> 00:06:25.100
<v Speaker 1>those distractions from your </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>

127
00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:26.023
<v Speaker 1>Another thing that I don't really do but</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of my friends do is to use a kind </v>

128
00:06:28.281 --> 00:06:29.114
<v Speaker 1>of software or application that blocks </v>
<v Speaker 1>websites that you find particularly </v>

129
00:06:32.511 --> 00:06:34.190
<v Speaker 1>distracting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's one,</v>

130
00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:37.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this one software called cold Turkey and</v>

131
00:06:37.371 --> 00:06:40.280
<v Speaker 1>there's another one that is called stay </v>
<v Speaker 1>focused.</v>

132
00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:43.610
<v Speaker 1>That's a chrome add on that you can use </v>
<v Speaker 1>to block certain websites.</v>

133
00:06:43.611 --> 00:06:44.444
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say you get caught up in facebook </v>

134
00:06:45.411 --> 00:06:46.244
<v Speaker 1>all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you visit tech crunch blog all the </v>

135
00:06:48.201 --> 00:06:49.034
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you want to just stay away from </v>

136
00:06:50.031 --> 00:06:52.400
<v Speaker 1>those for a while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can put those in your block list.</v>

137
00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:54.420
<v Speaker 1>So then whenever you turn on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>software,</v>

138
00:06:54.421 --> 00:06:55.730
<v Speaker 1>it'll block those websites.</v>

139
00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:59.450
<v Speaker 1>And I think you can specify a certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>period of time as well so that you can't</v>

140
00:06:59.451 --> 00:07:00.284
<v Speaker 1>just go in and change the settings </v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever you want and will actually </v>

141
00:07:02.031 --> 00:07:03.160
<v Speaker 1>block you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

142
00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:04.213
<v Speaker 1>based on the time you decide in advance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can kind of change your mind in </v>

143
00:07:07.161 --> 00:07:07.994
<v Speaker 1>the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've already fixed the blockage of </v>

144
00:07:09.711 --> 00:07:10.544
<v Speaker 1>those websites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's another thing you can try if </v>

145
00:07:12.111 --> 00:07:14.390
<v Speaker 1>you're distracted by any specific </v>
<v Speaker 1>websites.</v>

146
00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:18.950
<v Speaker 1>Another thing that I do to stay focused </v>
<v Speaker 1>is I listened to binaural beats track on</v>

147
00:07:18.951 --> 00:07:19.784
<v Speaker 1>Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just search for binaural beats </v>

148
00:07:20.991 --> 00:07:23.630
<v Speaker 1>concentration and one of those videos </v>
<v Speaker 1>will come up.</v>

149
00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:26.090
<v Speaker 1>I have a specific one that I liked that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I always listened to.</v>

150
00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:27.193
<v Speaker 1>So you can try a few of them to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>which one helps you focus and just put </v>

151
00:07:30.321 --> 00:07:32.060
<v Speaker 1>on your headphones and while you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>studying,</v>

152
00:07:32.061 --> 00:07:33.120
<v Speaker 1>use that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

153
00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:36.230
<v Speaker 1>you can do it when you're just studying </v>
<v Speaker 1>with your textbook,</v>

154
00:07:36.231 --> 00:07:38.180
<v Speaker 1>but also if you're using audio </v>
<v Speaker 1>materials,</v>

155
00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:39.770
<v Speaker 1>you can play both at the same time.</v>

156
00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:42.200
<v Speaker 1>If it's on your computer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can play that youtube track,</v>

157
00:07:42.201 --> 00:07:46.370
<v Speaker 1>but you can also use your cds and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>have them playing over top of each other</v>

158
00:07:46.371 --> 00:07:47.204
<v Speaker 1>and it's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can turn down the binaural beats a </v>

159
00:07:48.441 --> 00:07:51.230
<v Speaker 1>little bit and just listen to the audio </v>
<v Speaker 1>track mainly.</v>

160
00:07:51.231 --> 00:07:54.440
<v Speaker 1>But the binaural beats be there in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>background kind of helping you focus.</v>

161
00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:56.600
<v Speaker 1>Some people say that binaural beats </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't work.</v>

162
00:07:56.601 --> 00:07:58.670
<v Speaker 1>There's no scientific basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

163
00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:00.950
<v Speaker 1>if it helps you focus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it works.</v>

164
00:08:00.951 --> 00:08:03.500
<v Speaker 1>So it doesn't really matter if it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientifically proven or not.</v>

165
00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:04.820
<v Speaker 1>Try it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see if it helps you.</v>

166
00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:06.123
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so those are some of my ideas on how to </v>

167
00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:09.920
<v Speaker 1>stay focused.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Focus comes first.</v>

168
00:08:09.921 --> 00:08:13.220
<v Speaker 1>It's important for learning the language</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you really want to get good at.</v>

169
00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:15.470
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is Paul and this is Lang Focus.</v>

170
00:08:15.471 --> 00:08:17.450
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for tuning in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have a good day.</v>

171
00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:20.663
<v Speaker 1>When you were an infant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you spend about a year just sitting </v>

172
00:08:22.861 --> 00:08:25.980
<v Speaker 1>there and listening to the language </v>
<v Speaker 1>before you actually say anything,</v>

173
00:08:25.981 --> 00:08:26.814
<v Speaker 1>just absorbing the sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were internalizing the phonology </v>

174
00:08:29.131 --> 00:08:31.620
<v Speaker 1>before you actually produce it as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>adult.</v>

175
00:08:31.621 --> 00:08:33.510
<v Speaker 1>Do you have a year to sit around doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

176
00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:34.553
<v Speaker 1>I know I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've met a lot of people who are great </v>

177
00:08:37.441 --> 00:08:40.710
<v Speaker 1>with languages while traveling and also </v>
<v Speaker 1>in my regular life,</v>

178
00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:41.873
<v Speaker 1>and I'd like to talk about a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly impressive people that we </v>

179
00:08:44.641 --> 00:08:45.840
<v Speaker 1>can learn something from.</v>
