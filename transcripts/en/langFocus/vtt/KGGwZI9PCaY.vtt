00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.000
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for tuning into the lane focus</v>

2
00:00:03.001 --> 00:00:04.290
<v Speaker 1>channel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My name is Paul.</v>

3
00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.370
<v Speaker 1>Today we're going to talk about a common</v>
<v Speaker 1>question related to language learning.</v>

4
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:09.383
<v Speaker 1>Can adults learn a second language the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same way that they learned their native </v>

5
00:00:12.481 --> 00:00:16.590
<v Speaker 1>language as a kid in a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>marketing surrounding different language</v>

6
00:00:16.591 --> 00:00:18.960
<v Speaker 1>programs and the courses that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>buy,</v>

7
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.100
<v Speaker 1>you'll often see that you'll see them </v>
<v Speaker 1>justify their methodology by saying this</v>

8
00:00:23.101 --> 00:00:26.100
<v Speaker 1>is the way you learned as a kid or when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you were a kid,</v>

9
00:00:26.101 --> 00:00:26.934
<v Speaker 1>you didn't need written materials,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just listened and all that kind of </v>

10
00:00:29.161 --> 00:00:31.020
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I wanted to talk about that.</v>

11
00:00:31.021 --> 00:00:31.854
<v Speaker 1>Is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it actually possible and is it </v>

12
00:00:33.541 --> 00:00:36.300
<v Speaker 1>practical to learn that way when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>an adult?</v>

13
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.760
<v Speaker 1>So let's get into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

14
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.820
<v Speaker 1>adults learn differently from infants </v>
<v Speaker 1>and toddlers.</v>

15
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.900
<v Speaker 1>It's been proven through studies that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there is definitely a critical age range</v>

16
00:00:45.901 --> 00:00:49.890
<v Speaker 1>after which it becomes more difficult to</v>
<v Speaker 1>learn a language.</v>

17
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.963
<v Speaker 1>When you are an infant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are using both hemispheres of your </v>

18
00:00:53.581 --> 00:00:56.010
<v Speaker 1>brain for language learning and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>process,</v>

19
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.933
<v Speaker 1>that way of learning usually lasts until</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're about two years old and then it </v>

20
00:00:59.881 --> 00:01:00.714
<v Speaker 1>starts to change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It starts to become localized in your </v>

21
00:01:02.971 --> 00:01:06.270
<v Speaker 1>left brain and your right brain starts </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be deemphasized.</v>

22
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.250
<v Speaker 1>Now it doesn't happen immediately right </v>
<v Speaker 1>away,</v>

23
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.750
<v Speaker 1>but that process continues from about </v>
<v Speaker 1>age two until you reach puberty,</v>

24
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.230
<v Speaker 1>so around the time of puberty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so after you reach puberty,</v>

25
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.190
<v Speaker 1>your language learning processes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now a very left brain process,</v>

26
00:01:20.191 --> 00:01:24.570
<v Speaker 1>it's much more of an intentional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's much more of an intentional kind of</v>

27
00:01:24.571 --> 00:01:25.404
<v Speaker 1>study rather than just an intuitive </v>
<v Speaker 1>absorption of information from your </v>

28
00:01:28.741 --> 00:01:31.440
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it definitely does become different.</v>

29
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.840
<v Speaker 1>Let me play devil's advocate for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>minute.</v>

30
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:34.733
<v Speaker 1>Let's just hypothetically say that yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can learn the same way that we </v>

31
00:01:38.191 --> 00:01:39.240
<v Speaker 1>learned as infants.</v>

32
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.520
<v Speaker 1>Is that practical?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should we learn that way?</v>

33
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:42.743
<v Speaker 1>I would say that it's really impractical</v>
<v Speaker 1>for an adult to learn their second </v>

34
00:01:45.721 --> 00:01:48.990
<v Speaker 1>language the same way they learn their </v>
<v Speaker 1>native language because adults just have</v>

35
00:01:48.991 --> 00:01:52.170
<v Speaker 1>a very different lifestyle than little </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids or infants do.</v>

36
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.333
<v Speaker 1>When you're an infant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you spend about a year just sitting </v>

37
00:01:55.561 --> 00:01:58.680
<v Speaker 1>there listening to the language before </v>
<v Speaker 1>you actually say anything,</v>

38
00:01:58.681 --> 00:01:59.514
<v Speaker 1>just absorbing the sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're internalizing the phonology </v>

39
00:02:01.831 --> 00:02:04.320
<v Speaker 1>before you actually produce it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As an adult,</v>

40
00:02:04.321 --> 00:02:06.180
<v Speaker 1>do you have a year to sit around doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

41
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.310
<v Speaker 1>I know I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have too many things.</v>

42
00:02:08.311 --> 00:02:09.144
<v Speaker 1>I want to study too many things I want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do and experience to many other </v>

43
00:02:11.641 --> 00:02:13.950
<v Speaker 1>languages I want to get to in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>

44
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a year to just sit and </v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

45
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:16.763
<v Speaker 1>so unless you were an infant or maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you're retired or unemployed and </v>

46
00:02:19.981 --> 00:02:20.814
<v Speaker 1>have nothing to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I guess a year of just sitting and </v>

47
00:02:22.771 --> 00:02:24.840
<v Speaker 1>listening is probably a waste of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

48
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.010
<v Speaker 1>Am I right about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

49
00:02:26.011 --> 00:02:26.844
<v Speaker 1>also related to time is this kid spent </v>
<v Speaker 1>so much time in an immersive </v>

50
00:02:30.301 --> 00:02:31.770
<v Speaker 1>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10,</v>

51
00:02:31.771 --> 00:02:33.930
<v Speaker 1>12 hours a day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their whole waking life.</v>

52
00:02:33.931 --> 00:02:37.530
<v Speaker 1>They are surrounded by that language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When their kids at school,</v>

53
00:02:37.531 --> 00:02:38.790
<v Speaker 1>at home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in their environment,</v>

54
00:02:38.791 --> 00:02:41.190
<v Speaker 1>on tv,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything is in that language.</v>

55
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.880
<v Speaker 1>Now you probably have a job that's in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your native language.</v>

56
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.960
<v Speaker 1>You probably have a circle of friends </v>
<v Speaker 1>that speak your native language and your</v>

57
00:02:48.961 --> 00:02:51.150
<v Speaker 1>family probably speaks your native </v>
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>

58
00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.223
<v Speaker 1>so do you really have 10 to 12 hours a </v>
<v Speaker 1>day to be immersed in your second </v>

59
00:02:55.831 --> 00:02:59.010
<v Speaker 1>language and even if you are in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>

60
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.690
<v Speaker 1>even if you moved to a country where </v>
<v Speaker 1>that language is spoken,</v>

61
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:02.763
<v Speaker 1>do you really have a circle of native </v>
<v Speaker 1>speakers who are talking to you all the </v>

62
00:03:05.921 --> 00:03:06.754
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same way that adults talk to babies </v>

63
00:03:08.201 --> 00:03:09.490
<v Speaker 1>or toddlers all the time.</v>

64
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.710
<v Speaker 1>When you're a toddler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are trying to talk to you,</v>

65
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.390
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to encourage you to speak</v>

66
00:03:13.391 --> 00:03:15.790
<v Speaker 1>and they're trying to help raise you by </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking to you,</v>

67
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.863
<v Speaker 1>but when you're an adult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people just don't really care that </v>

68
00:03:19.121 --> 00:03:21.070
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you are going to learn their language</v>

69
00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.963
<v Speaker 1>to support you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not going to sit there </v>

70
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:24.453
<v Speaker 1>intentionally talking to you all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time just to give you an opportunity to </v>

71
00:03:27.071 --> 00:03:27.904
<v Speaker 1>practice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you probably have like one hour a </v>

72
00:03:29.831 --> 00:03:30.910
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two hours a day,</v>

73
00:03:30.911 --> 00:03:33.580
<v Speaker 1>three hours a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever it is that you have to focus on</v>

74
00:03:33.581 --> 00:03:36.430
<v Speaker 1>that language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't be immersed in it all day,</v>

75
00:03:36.431 --> 00:03:38.830
<v Speaker 1>every day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same way that a child can,</v>

76
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:39.693
<v Speaker 1>so that means that you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>strategize and use that time available </v>

77
00:03:41.861 --> 00:03:42.694
<v Speaker 1>to you in the best way that you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as adults we try to look for ways to </v>

78
00:03:46.031 --> 00:03:49.870
<v Speaker 1>accelerate our learning and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways we do that is by cutting out things</v>

79
00:03:49.871 --> 00:03:52.480
<v Speaker 1>that we really don't need to learn right</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

80
00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:53.413
<v Speaker 1>So tell me this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you learn a second language as an </v>

81
00:03:54.821 --> 00:03:57.970
<v Speaker 1>adult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you really care how to say ladybug or</v>

82
00:03:57.971 --> 00:03:58.804
<v Speaker 1>how to say Choo Choo train,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or do you care what the sound is that a </v>

83
00:04:01.541 --> 00:04:03.310
<v Speaker 1>bunny rabbit makes like boing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boing,</v>

84
00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.510
<v Speaker 1>boing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>

85
00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.980
<v Speaker 1>do you care about all the Onomatopoeia </v>
<v Speaker 1>that appear in comic books like Bam,</v>

86
00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:09.910
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smash,</v>

87
00:04:09.911 --> 00:04:11.260
<v Speaker 1>sap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pow Kaboom,</v>

88
00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.430
<v Speaker 1>Kapow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>splat?</v>

89
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:13.383
<v Speaker 1>Do you care about all those sounds?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you really need to learn those words </v>

90
00:04:15.671 --> 00:04:17.410
<v Speaker 1>in that language?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably not.</v>

91
00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:18.543
<v Speaker 1>When you're an adult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to cut out the things that are </v>

92
00:04:20.261 --> 00:04:21.094
<v Speaker 1>not necessary and focus on what's most </v>
<v Speaker 1>relevant to your adult life and it's </v>

93
00:04:24.611 --> 00:04:28.300
<v Speaker 1>probably not things that are relevant to</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids a lot of the time now,</v>

94
00:04:28.301 --> 00:04:30.610
<v Speaker 1>this is partly a matter of efficient use</v>
<v Speaker 1>of time,</v>

95
00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:31.773
<v Speaker 1>but it's also a matter of what kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>language is appropriate to use as an </v>

96
00:04:35.081 --> 00:04:35.830
<v Speaker 1>adult.</v>

97
00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:36.663
<v Speaker 1>Now kids speak like kids and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>usually speak that way for years and </v>

98
00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.893
<v Speaker 1>years and years until they become more </v>
<v Speaker 1>influenced by the literary language and </v>

99
00:04:43.961 --> 00:04:47.020
<v Speaker 1>they start to speak more like adults who</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be taken seriously,</v>

100
00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.250
<v Speaker 1>but you as an adult probably want to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>taken seriously fairly early on,</v>

101
00:04:51.251 --> 00:04:54.070
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're using the language </v>
<v Speaker 1>for work or for business.</v>

102
00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.933
<v Speaker 1>So you don't have 15 years to spend on </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking like a kid before you learn to </v>

103
00:04:59.711 --> 00:05:01.360
<v Speaker 1>speak more like an adult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

104
00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:02.313
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like I looked at the earnings report </v>

105
00:05:03.581 --> 00:05:05.050
<v Speaker 1>and stuff and it was really cool and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>

106
00:05:05.051 --> 00:05:07.450
<v Speaker 1>but my boss was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really dumb.</v>

107
00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:08.493
<v Speaker 1>As adults,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're at some disadvantages when it </v>

108
00:05:09.641 --> 00:05:13.690
<v Speaker 1>comes to learning a second language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we also have some advantages and one</v>

109
00:05:13.691 --> 00:05:14.524
<v Speaker 1>of them is our ability to analyze what </v>
<v Speaker 1>our learning needs are and to focus our </v>

110
00:05:18.281 --> 00:05:21.670
<v Speaker 1>attention on meeting those needs so you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can look at your goals for the language,</v>

111
00:05:21.671 --> 00:05:23.740
<v Speaker 1>what situations you will use the </v>
<v Speaker 1>language in,</v>

112
00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.310
<v Speaker 1>and then focus on what you need in order</v>
<v Speaker 1>to achieve those goals,</v>

113
00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:28.510
<v Speaker 1>so that's your advantage.</v>

114
00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:29.463
<v Speaker 1>You should use that advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to spend years and years </v>

115
00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.810
<v Speaker 1>building a base the way kids do in order</v>
<v Speaker 1>to achieve your goals.</v>

116
00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:36.303
<v Speaker 1>Another thing that makes learning as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>adult difference is that your self </v>

117
00:05:39.221 --> 00:05:42.070
<v Speaker 1>concept affects the way you learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're a little kid,</v>

118
00:05:42.071 --> 00:05:44.320
<v Speaker 1>you are carefree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't worry about anything.</v>

119
00:05:44.321 --> 00:05:45.154
<v Speaker 1>You don't really have an ego yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't think about your relation to </v>

120
00:05:48.401 --> 00:05:52.330
<v Speaker 1>the world and what's allowed and what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not allowed and things you can do,</v>

121
00:05:52.331 --> 00:05:54.670
<v Speaker 1>things you can't do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't really have that concept yet.</v>

122
00:05:54.671 --> 00:05:59.300
<v Speaker 1>You just do whatever the heck you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>and as an adult you can't be like that.</v>

123
00:05:59.301 --> 00:06:00.134
<v Speaker 1>You have all of these layers of self </v>
<v Speaker 1>concept that have developed throughout </v>

124
00:06:03.801 --> 00:06:05.210
<v Speaker 1>the years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've developed an ego,</v>

125
00:06:05.211 --> 00:06:06.044
<v Speaker 1>you've developed a sense of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>relation to other people into the world </v>

126
00:06:09.411 --> 00:06:11.870
<v Speaker 1>and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can do these things.</v>

127
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:14.060
<v Speaker 1>I can't do these things if I do this </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

128
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.820
<v Speaker 1>people will react a certain way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I do this thing,</v>

129
00:06:16.821 --> 00:06:17.654
<v Speaker 1>people will react differently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that causes a lot of mental blocks </v>

130
00:06:21.051 --> 00:06:21.884
<v Speaker 1>towards learning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when it comes to languages </v>

131
00:06:23.811 --> 00:06:24.644
<v Speaker 1>for some reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you think that you're not that smart </v>

132
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:27.823
<v Speaker 1>or if you think that you're not that </v>
<v Speaker 1>socially savvy so you can't communicate </v>

133
00:06:30.801 --> 00:06:31.634
<v Speaker 1>with people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might self sabotage when practicing </v>

134
00:06:34.521 --> 00:06:36.440
<v Speaker 1>or learning a language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of thing,</v>

135
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:37.483
<v Speaker 1>or you might self sabotage because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that it doesn't match your </v>

136
00:06:41.931 --> 00:06:44.720
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if your friends are all into sports</v>

137
00:06:44.721 --> 00:06:47.720
<v Speaker 1>and they're all into music and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>into studying a language,</v>

138
00:06:47.721 --> 00:06:49.940
<v Speaker 1>maybe you'll be a nerd or maybe you'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>be different than them.</v>

139
00:06:49.941 --> 00:06:50.774
<v Speaker 1>That kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You start to be conscious of that sort </v>

140
00:06:52.101 --> 00:06:52.934
<v Speaker 1>of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As an adult or as little kids aren't </v>

141
00:06:54.771 --> 00:06:55.490
<v Speaker 1>conscious of that.</v>

142
00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:58.190
<v Speaker 1>They don't give a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just do whatever they want and it's</v>

143
00:06:58.250 --> 00:06:59.083
<v Speaker 1>all about them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in order to learn the way a kid </v>

144
00:07:01.581 --> 00:07:02.414
<v Speaker 1>learns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you kind of have to get back into that </v>

145
00:07:03.921 --> 00:07:04.754
<v Speaker 1>childlike headspace and forget about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world and just focus on yourself and </v>

146
00:07:08.661 --> 00:07:10.790
<v Speaker 1>it's hard for adults to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean in some ways,</v>

147
00:07:10.791 --> 00:07:13.400
<v Speaker 1>maybe we can learn from the way kids </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn,</v>

148
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:16.400
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time it's quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult.</v>

149
00:07:16.401 --> 00:07:17.234
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't really fit into the way we </v>
<v Speaker 1>live and you would have to remove a lot </v>

150
00:07:19.701 --> 00:07:20.534
<v Speaker 1>of layers of your self concept in order </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do that and that would take some </v>

151
00:07:23.631 --> 00:07:24.464
<v Speaker 1>effort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of a separate mission from </v>

152
00:07:25.731 --> 00:07:26.900
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A language learning mission,</v>

153
00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:27.913
<v Speaker 1>so it's much more practical in the short</v>
<v Speaker 1>term as adults to set up a very </v>

154
00:07:31.851 --> 00:07:32.684
<v Speaker 1>intentional program of learning that can</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivate you through some of those </v>

155
00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:37.393
<v Speaker 1>things that discourage you and actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>push you forward so that we can do that </v>

156
00:07:40.461 --> 00:07:41.294
<v Speaker 1>through setting up a learning program </v>
<v Speaker 1>and thinking about our goals and </v>

157
00:07:44.091 --> 00:07:46.420
<v Speaker 1>visualizing our goals and that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing to.</v>

158
00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:50.210
<v Speaker 1>Because we're going to have those blocks</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're going to have those times when</v>

159
00:07:50.211 --> 00:07:52.460
<v Speaker 1>we hesitate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because of that self concept,</v>

160
00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.830
<v Speaker 1>as adults,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can get through that as kids.</v>

161
00:07:54.831 --> 00:07:55.664
<v Speaker 1>You don't need to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we don't really need those </v>

162
00:07:57.561 --> 00:08:00.200
<v Speaker 1>strategies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think that's another big difference</v>

163
00:08:00.201 --> 00:08:02.540
<v Speaker 1>between adult learners and child </v>
<v Speaker 1>learners,</v>

164
00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:04.670
<v Speaker 1>especially when it comes to languages </v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

165
00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:08.360
<v Speaker 1>So the hype that you can learn a second </v>
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>

166
00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:12.140
<v Speaker 1>the way that babies learn their native </v>
<v Speaker 1>language is exactly just that hype.</v>

167
00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:13.393
<v Speaker 1>Do you think babies learn their native </v>
<v Speaker 1>language by listening to eight hours of </v>

168
00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:18.500
<v Speaker 1>audio on a language CD?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course not.</v>

169
00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:20.870
<v Speaker 1>So take it for what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's marketing hype.</v>

170
00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:21.943
<v Speaker 1>You can see through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean they're bad learning </v>

171
00:08:23.481 --> 00:08:24.314
<v Speaker 1>materials,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just don't buy into the marketing </v>

172
00:08:26.061 --> 00:08:26.990
<v Speaker 1>hype.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

173
00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:28.490
<v Speaker 1>This is Lang.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Focus on Paul.</v>

174
00:08:28.491 --> 00:08:30.320
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for watching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have a good day.</v>

175
00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:34.220
<v Speaker 1>Bye now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This goes back to my first time visiting</v>

176
00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:38.360
<v Speaker 1>Egypt in 1997.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in a backpack of resort called the</v>

177
00:08:38.361 --> 00:08:43.361
<v Speaker 1>hub and I met a number of girls who were</v>
<v Speaker 1>there selling bracelets.</v>

178
00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:46.460
<v Speaker 1>They were selling little trinkets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>souvenirs to tourists,</v>

179
00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:48.890
<v Speaker 1>like me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inner dialogue inside our head.</v>

180
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:49.903
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of a voice that's constantly </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrating our lives and commenting on </v>

181
00:08:53.361 --> 00:08:54.440
<v Speaker 1>what's happening around us.</v>
