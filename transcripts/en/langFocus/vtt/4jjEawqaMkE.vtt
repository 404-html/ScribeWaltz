<v Speaker 1>What was today's topic?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forgot.</v>

2
00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:07.923
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3
00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.750
<v Speaker 1>Hebrew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

4
00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:13.250
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arabic.</v>

5
00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:20.383
<v Speaker 2>Hm.</v>

6
00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:21.881
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

7
00:00:21.881 --> 00:00:23.230
<v Speaker 1>I've heard of that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was it?</v>

8
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.720
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>American.</v>

9
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.423
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

10
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.343
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and </v>

11
00:00:33.331 --> 00:00:37.710
<v Speaker 1>my name is Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today's topic is the m horic language or</v>

12
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:38.753
<v Speaker 1>Ahmadinia as it's known in Amharic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Horak is one of the major languages </v>

13
00:00:42.841 --> 00:00:43.674
<v Speaker 1>of Ethiopia and it's the official </v>
<v Speaker 1>working language of the Ethiopian </v>

14
00:00:46.861 --> 00:00:47.694
<v Speaker 1>federal government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Regional and local authorities are free </v>

15
00:00:50.251 --> 00:00:52.320
<v Speaker 1>to choose their working language in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ethiopia,</v>

16
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.990
<v Speaker 1>but I'm horic is the working language of</v>
<v Speaker 1>several regions.</v>

17
00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.943
<v Speaker 1>According to the 2007 census,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the native language of 22 million </v>

18
00:01:00.031 --> 00:01:04.350
<v Speaker 1>people or around 30% of the population </v>
<v Speaker 1>of 74 million.</v>

19
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.520
<v Speaker 1>But over the last 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the population of Ethiopia is thought to</v>

20
00:01:08.521 --> 00:01:09.354
<v Speaker 1>have surpassed 100 million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the number of native Amharic </v>

21
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.223
<v Speaker 1>speakers is probably over 30 million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Ethiopia is a country where many </v>

22
00:01:16.981 --> 00:01:17.814
<v Speaker 1>people are multilingual and millions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More people speak Amharic as a second </v>

23
00:01:20.941 --> 00:01:23.220
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in cities and towns.</v>

24
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.180
<v Speaker 1>Am horic is a member of the Semitic </v>
<v Speaker 1>language family,</v>

25
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.670
<v Speaker 1>which also includes Hebrew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arabic,</v>

26
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.670
<v Speaker 1>Aramaic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the t gray and too granule languages</v>

27
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.700
<v Speaker 1>which are spoken in Ethiopia and Eritrea</v>
<v Speaker 1>all Semitic languages developed from the</v>

28
00:01:37.771 --> 00:01:39.780
<v Speaker 1>theoretic Prodo Semitic language.</v>

29
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.480
<v Speaker 1>The ethiopic or ECO Semitic languages </v>
<v Speaker 1>are part of the South Semitic branch and</v>

30
00:01:45.481 --> 00:01:46.314
<v Speaker 1>the most common theory is that all Ethio</v>
<v Speaker 1>Semitic languages including I'm </v>

31
00:01:49.281 --> 00:01:50.114
<v Speaker 1>horrific,</v>
<v Speaker 1>developed from a common Prato Ethio </v>

32
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:53.723
<v Speaker 1>Semitic language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This Prato Ethio Semitic language is </v>

33
00:01:55.471 --> 00:01:56.304
<v Speaker 1>thought to have developed from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>language of migrants from Southern </v>

34
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.920
<v Speaker 1>Arabia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>presumably old south Arabian languages.</v>

35
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.933
<v Speaker 1>These migrants intermixed with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>native people who spoke who schick </v>

36
00:02:05.521 --> 00:02:10.521
<v Speaker 1>languages and Prodo Ethio Semitic arose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This language was a direct descendant of</v>

37
00:02:10.981 --> 00:02:14.910
<v Speaker 1>the language of the migrants from this </v>
<v Speaker 1>protal Ethio Semitic language.</v>

38
00:02:14.911 --> 00:02:17.160
<v Speaker 1>Two branches developed the southern </v>
<v Speaker 1>branch,</v>

39
00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.620
<v Speaker 1>which includes I'm horic and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>northern branch,</v>

40
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.590
<v Speaker 1>which includes t gray to [inaudible] and</v>
<v Speaker 1>gaze,</v>

41
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:23.453
<v Speaker 1>the oldest attested Ethio Semitic </v>
<v Speaker 1>language and the one that became the </v>

42
00:02:26.281 --> 00:02:27.114
<v Speaker 1>official language of the [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 1>empire and remained the official </v>

43
00:02:29.971 --> 00:02:33.060
<v Speaker 1>literary language in Ethiopia until the </v>
<v Speaker 1>19th century.</v>

44
00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.140
<v Speaker 1>Some believe in that theory of migration</v>
<v Speaker 1>from Southern Arabia.</v>

45
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.153
<v Speaker 1>But some believe that I'm horic </v>
<v Speaker 1>developed from a Semitic language that </v>

46
00:02:40.681 --> 00:02:43.260
<v Speaker 1>had existed in the area before that </v>
<v Speaker 1>migration.</v>

47
00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.190
<v Speaker 1>And in recent years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another theory has arisen that I'm horic</v>

48
00:02:47.191 --> 00:02:48.024
<v Speaker 1>is actually a creole that arose from </v>
<v Speaker 1>contact between Semitic speaking </v>

49
00:02:51.211 --> 00:02:52.044
<v Speaker 1>officers and cush should expediating </v>
<v Speaker 1>soldiers in the accent might empire </v>

50
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.853
<v Speaker 1>after the fourth century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this theory is hotly contested and </v>

51
00:02:58.741 --> 00:02:59.574
<v Speaker 1>is not the general consensus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The earliest known am Horak writing is </v>

52
00:03:02.231 --> 00:03:03.064
<v Speaker 1>from the 13th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though it was mainly a spoken </v>

53
00:03:05.501 --> 00:03:06.334
<v Speaker 1>language at that time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was the time of the solomonic </v>

54
00:03:08.411 --> 00:03:10.180
<v Speaker 1>dynasty when King,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

55
00:03:10.181 --> 00:03:11.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm luck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>made Amharic,</v>

56
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.350
<v Speaker 1>the spoken Lingua Franca of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ethiopian courts,</v>

57
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.650
<v Speaker 1>and it became known as the language of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the king to sign a new goose gaze.</v>

58
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:20.613
<v Speaker 1>The language of the previous x amount </v>
<v Speaker 1>rulers continued to be used as the </v>

59
00:03:23.441 --> 00:03:25.930
<v Speaker 1>language of literature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The sonance oof.</v>

60
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.273
<v Speaker 1>This resulted in a diagnostic situation </v>
<v Speaker 1>that would last for centuries with gays </v>

61
00:03:31.091 --> 00:03:34.510
<v Speaker 1>being used from literature and did the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ethiopian Orthodox Church.</v>

62
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.630
<v Speaker 1>And I'm Horak being used in speech in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the 15th century under the rule of Zadie</v>

63
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:40.503
<v Speaker 1>Yacob troops who collected taxes for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>king likely brought em horic into other </v>

64
00:03:44.021 --> 00:03:44.470
<v Speaker 1>regions.</v>

65
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:45.303
<v Speaker 1>Further south in the mid 19th century am</v>
<v Speaker 1>Horak began to replace a gaze as the </v>

66
00:03:49.601 --> 00:03:53.080
<v Speaker 1>literary language case in point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Ethiopian Emperor's tail,</v>

67
00:03:53.081 --> 00:03:53.914
<v Speaker 1>just the second and mindy leak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second had their chronicles written </v>

68
00:03:56.741 --> 00:03:57.574
<v Speaker 1>in Amharic rather than gaze,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which had been used for previous </v>

69
00:04:00.131 --> 00:04:00.964
<v Speaker 1>emperors under mini leak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second Ethiopia grew into something </v>

70
00:04:04.151 --> 00:04:08.710
<v Speaker 1>resembling its current borders am Horak </v>
<v Speaker 1>became the defacto official language and</v>

71
00:04:08.711 --> 00:04:09.544
<v Speaker 1>emhart speaking officials were </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsible for the newly incorporated </v>

72
00:04:12.251 --> 00:04:13.084
<v Speaker 1>territories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The spread of the printing press in the </v>

73
00:04:14.831 --> 00:04:15.664
<v Speaker 1>19th and 20th centuries contributed </v>
<v Speaker 1>further to the spread of Mri as in the </v>

74
00:04:19.151 --> 00:04:19.984
<v Speaker 1>20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most new print materials including the </v>

75
00:04:22.301 --> 00:04:23.134
<v Speaker 1>first newspaper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were written in an pauric rather than </v>

76
00:04:24.941 --> 00:04:27.370
<v Speaker 1>gays.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the early 20th century,</v>

77
00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.010
<v Speaker 1>Italian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>French and English were used as the main</v>

78
00:04:30.011 --> 00:04:33.760
<v Speaker 1>languages of school instruction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then in 19:44</v>

79
00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.810
<v Speaker 1>AM horic became the sole language of </v>
<v Speaker 1>instruction in primary schools under the</v>

80
00:04:37.811 --> 00:04:39.070
<v Speaker 1>rule of Haile Selassie.</v>

81
00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:40.413
<v Speaker 1>He then made them Horak the official </v>
<v Speaker 1>language of Ethiopia in 1955 during the </v>

82
00:04:44.501 --> 00:04:49.501
<v Speaker 1>socialist government known as the deck </v>
<v Speaker 1>from 1974 to 1991 increased development,</v>

83
00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:51.723
<v Speaker 1>urbanization and an increase in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>number of public schools and adult </v>

84
00:04:54.641 --> 00:04:57.730
<v Speaker 1>literacy programs caused them horic to </v>
<v Speaker 1>spread even more,</v>

85
00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:58.623
<v Speaker 1>but still empiric was much more widely </v>
<v Speaker 1>spoken in towns and cities and not as </v>

86
00:05:01.991 --> 00:05:06.040
<v Speaker 1>widely spoken in rural areas except in </v>
<v Speaker 1>its original native regions.</v>

87
00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:07.173
<v Speaker 1>After 1991 language policies were </v>
<v Speaker 1>changed to give more influenced to the </v>

88
00:05:10.811 --> 00:05:11.644
<v Speaker 1>other languages of Ethiopia and there </v>
<v Speaker 1>are over 80 of them currently regional </v>

89
00:05:15.221 --> 00:05:16.054
<v Speaker 1>and local authorities can choose their </v>
<v Speaker 1>own working language and their own </v>

90
00:05:18.641 --> 00:05:19.474
<v Speaker 1>language of primary school education.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Amharic remains the most widely </v>

91
00:05:22.901 --> 00:05:23.734
<v Speaker 1>spoken Lingua Franca with a large </v>
<v Speaker 1>proportion of the urban population </v>

92
00:05:26.591 --> 00:05:29.050
<v Speaker 1>throughout the country being able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>speak Amharic.</v>

93
00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.510
<v Speaker 1>So what does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Horak like first of all,</v>

94
00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.180
<v Speaker 1>what's this interesting script that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>Horak is written in?</v>

95
00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:38.590
<v Speaker 1>Well that's actually the gay script,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is used not only to write the gays</v>

96
00:05:38.591 --> 00:05:41.290
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also amharic to Grenada and others.</v>

97
00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.730
<v Speaker 1>The gay script is an Abogada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Each character represents a syllable and</v>

98
00:05:45.731 --> 00:05:46.564
<v Speaker 1>consists of a consonant as its major </v>
<v Speaker 1>components plus an attached ligature or </v>

99
00:05:49.871 --> 00:05:53.200
<v Speaker 1>other modification that represents a </v>
<v Speaker 1>vowel in Amharic.</v>

100
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:57.680
<v Speaker 1>This gaze based writing system is called</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] and I'm Horak.</v>

101
00:05:57.681 --> 00:06:01.310
<v Speaker 1>There are plain consonants similar to </v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the consonants in English,</v>

102
00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.940
<v Speaker 1>and there are glottals sized consonants </v>
<v Speaker 1>or ejective consonants.</v>

103
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:05.833
<v Speaker 1>Globalized consonants are produced by </v>
<v Speaker 1>closing and reopening the gladys the </v>

104
00:06:09.291 --> 00:06:12.410
<v Speaker 1>space between your vocal chords while </v>
<v Speaker 1>making the consonant sound.</v>

105
00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:14.990
<v Speaker 1>When transliterated using Latin </v>
<v Speaker 1>characters,</v>

106
00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:15.883
<v Speaker 1>they usually have a dot underneath them </v>
<v Speaker 1>to distinguish them from their non </v>

107
00:06:18.681 --> 00:06:19.514
<v Speaker 1>globalized equivalents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's compare a plane consonant with </v>

108
00:06:22.161 --> 00:06:27.161
<v Speaker 1>it's globalized equivalent to Teta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also notice the doubled consonant.</v>

109
00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:32.893
<v Speaker 1>All consonants can be short or long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>long meaning that the consonant is </v>

110
00:06:36.111 --> 00:06:37.760
<v Speaker 1>doubled double in length.</v>

111
00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:38.803
<v Speaker 1>The distinction between short and long </v>
<v Speaker 1>consonants is important because </v>

112
00:06:41.421 --> 00:06:42.254
<v Speaker 1>sometimes the meaning of words is </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinguished by the length of the </v>

113
00:06:44.481 --> 00:06:46.070
<v Speaker 1>continent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

114
00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:51.910
<v Speaker 1>this means he said this means there is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this means swimming one,</v>

115
00:06:54.181 --> 00:06:56.000
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this means important,</v>

116
00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:57.313
<v Speaker 1>so in both cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the length of the consonant </v>

117
00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:01.070
<v Speaker 1>distinguishes the meaning of the words </v>
<v Speaker 1>doubled.</v>

118
00:07:01.071 --> 00:07:03.290
<v Speaker 1>Consonants are not distinguished in </v>
<v Speaker 1>writing,</v>

119
00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:04.153
<v Speaker 1>but in context amharic speakers have </v>
<v Speaker 1>little trouble with that sentence </v>

120
00:07:07.311 --> 00:07:08.660
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>

121
00:07:08.661 --> 00:07:13.250
<v Speaker 1>let's look at an equational sentence </v>
<v Speaker 1>using the verb to be you jus a Gel.</v>

122
00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:14.093
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this means the boy is short word for </v>

123
00:07:16.521 --> 00:07:17.570
<v Speaker 1>word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's boy.</v>

124
00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:22.600
<v Speaker 1>The short is Ou is a definite article is</v>
<v Speaker 1>boy you is the boy.</v>

125
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:29.480
<v Speaker 1>Notice that the verb to be is at the end</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the adjective comes before it.</v>

126
00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:33.320
<v Speaker 1>Amharic is a verb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Final language.</v>

127
00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:38.380
<v Speaker 1>So when predicate of sentences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the word order is sv or Ovi or Sov.</v>

128
00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:39.373
<v Speaker 1>Of course some sentences have no object </v>
<v Speaker 1>just to subject and an intransitive </v>

129
00:07:42.471 --> 00:07:43.760
<v Speaker 1>verb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

130
00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.550
<v Speaker 1>did you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the sentence means?</v>

131
00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:49.160
<v Speaker 1>The child fell word for word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's child,</v>

132
00:07:49.161 --> 00:07:50.210
<v Speaker 1>Duh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He fell.</v>

133
00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:51.403
<v Speaker 1>So this is the subject and this is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>verb and here's a sentence that does </v>

134
00:07:54.201 --> 00:07:55.280
<v Speaker 1>have a direct object.</v>

135
00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:00.290
<v Speaker 1>It means that the hunter killed Elian </v>
<v Speaker 1>word for word.</v>

136
00:08:00.291 --> 00:08:02.870
<v Speaker 1>It's hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lion he killed.</v>

137
00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:05.450
<v Speaker 1>Here's the subject,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the object and the verb.</v>

138
00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:09.650
<v Speaker 1>Something we can add to this sentence is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the optional direct object marker.</v>

139
00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:14.360
<v Speaker 1>Good Delta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you use the direct object marker,</v>

140
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:18.080
<v Speaker 1>then it's also possible to place the </v>
<v Speaker 1>object at the beginning of the sentence,</v>

141
00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:19.370
<v Speaker 1>making it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh sv.</v>

142
00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:25.490
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now let's try adding an adjective to</v>

143
00:08:25.491 --> 00:08:28.860
<v Speaker 1>the sentence I knew to look good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dead.</v>

144
00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:30.403
<v Speaker 1>The sentence now means the hunter killed</v>
<v Speaker 1>a big lion and you can see that the </v>

145
00:08:33.081 --> 00:08:33.914
<v Speaker 1>adjective is placed before the noun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The previous sentences all have an </v>

146
00:08:37.101 --> 00:08:37.934
<v Speaker 1>explicit subject,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there can also be no explicit </v>

147
00:08:39.951 --> 00:08:41.390
<v Speaker 1>subject.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

148
00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:46.070
<v Speaker 1>this sentence meaning he opened the door</v>
<v Speaker 1>that rune [inaudible] word for word,</v>

149
00:08:46.071 --> 00:08:49.520
<v Speaker 1>it's door direct object marker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He opened.</v>

150
00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:50.893
<v Speaker 1>No explicit subject is necessary here </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we know from the form of the </v>

151
00:08:53.721 --> 00:08:56.370
<v Speaker 1>verb that it refers to the third person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>masculine,</v>

152
00:08:56.371 --> 00:08:57.270
<v Speaker 1>singular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He.</v>

153
00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:00.390
<v Speaker 1>So this sentence is just olvey object,</v>
<v Speaker 1>verb.</v>

154
00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:05.160
<v Speaker 1>And that brings us to verbs similar to </v>
<v Speaker 1>an other Semitic languages.</v>

155
00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:07.890
<v Speaker 1>The verb consists of a stem and </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffixes,</v>

156
00:09:07.891 --> 00:09:09.630
<v Speaker 1>which indicate the person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gender,</v>

157
00:09:09.631 --> 00:09:12.450
<v Speaker 1>and number of the subject.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's take a look at this example.</v>

158
00:09:12.451 --> 00:09:13.284
<v Speaker 1>Verb meaning to break.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the stem of the perfect form and </v>

159
00:09:15.961 --> 00:09:19.620
<v Speaker 1>the suffix is placed after the stem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell us about the doer of the action.</v>

160
00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:20.813
<v Speaker 4>Sebesta sub sub,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sub sub sub borough Sabera to sub </v>

161
00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:29.453
<v Speaker 4>Barron.</v>

162
00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:33.510
<v Speaker 1>Now let's look at the imperfect form </v>
<v Speaker 1>based on this stem.</v>

163
00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:37.040
<v Speaker 4>You said Rod to [inaudible] to </v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible],</v>

164
00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:39.330
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible],</v>

165
00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:41.580
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible],</v>

166
00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:43.640
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible],</v>

167
00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:44.953
<v Speaker 1>the root system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's take a look at the stems of the </v>

168
00:09:47.061 --> 00:09:49.130
<v Speaker 1>perfect form and the imperfect form </v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

169
00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:53.870
<v Speaker 1>and let's focus on these letters here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Similar to an other Semitic languages.</v>

170
00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:54.733
<v Speaker 1>I'm Horak uses a system of root letters </v>
<v Speaker 1>and templates into which the root </v>

171
00:09:57.801 --> 00:09:58.634
<v Speaker 1>letters are inserted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roots consist of consonants commonly </v>

172
00:10:01.341 --> 00:10:03.140
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it can also be two,</v>

173
00:10:03.141 --> 00:10:03.974
<v Speaker 1>four or five and they are placed into </v>
<v Speaker 1>templates consisting of a vowel pattern </v>

174
00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:08.713
<v Speaker 1>as well as some continental affixes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The root gives us the core meaning and </v>

175
00:10:12.951 --> 00:10:13.784
<v Speaker 1>the template gives us grammatical </v>
<v Speaker 1>information and more specific </v>

176
00:10:16.251 --> 00:10:19.040
<v Speaker 1>information about the meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Notice that with this verb,</v>

177
00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:22.700
<v Speaker 1>the second route letter is doubled or </v>
<v Speaker 1>germinated in the perfect form.</v>

178
00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:24.980
<v Speaker 1>This is true for some verbs but not for </v>
<v Speaker 1>others.</v>

179
00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:27.800
<v Speaker 1>Those are a few of the important </v>
<v Speaker 1>features of them.</v>

180
00:10:27.801 --> 00:10:28.634
<v Speaker 1>Horic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at a few more example </v>

181
00:10:29.821 --> 00:10:31.610
<v Speaker 1>sentences and see what else we find.</v>

182
00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:34.070
<v Speaker 1>Here's the sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning we must go today.</v>

183
00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:36.710
<v Speaker 1>Study.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Made a Leben word for word.</v>

184
00:10:36.711 --> 00:10:38.840
<v Speaker 1>It's today to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We must,</v>

185
00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:39.913
<v Speaker 1>in this sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see a modal verb meaning must just </v>

186
00:10:41.721 --> 00:10:42.554
<v Speaker 1>like other verbs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This modal verb is conjugated for the </v>

187
00:10:44.181 --> 00:10:45.290
<v Speaker 1>subject.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this case,</v>

188
00:10:45.291 --> 00:10:46.124
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the modal verb comes at the end and </v>

189
00:10:47.811 --> 00:10:50.450
<v Speaker 1>before that we see the main verb meaning</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go in.</v>

190
00:10:50.451 --> 00:10:54.380
<v Speaker 1>It's infinitive form another sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can you meet [inaudible]?</v>

191
00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:59.150
<v Speaker 1>This means where can I find a doctor?</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] word for word,</v>

192
00:10:59.151 --> 00:11:01.640
<v Speaker 1>it's doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where is found?</v>

193
00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:06.050
<v Speaker 1>The word Hakeem is the same as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Arabic word for doctor and I would guess</v>

194
00:11:06.051 --> 00:11:06.884
<v Speaker 1>that this is a lone word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This word means where question words </v>

195
00:11:09.651 --> 00:11:10.484
<v Speaker 1>usually come directly before the verb </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can see that the object of the </v>

196
00:11:13.611 --> 00:11:14.444
<v Speaker 1>verb comes first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is an imperfect verb with these </v>

197
00:11:17.361 --> 00:11:18.194
<v Speaker 1>root consonants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ethics is showed that this is the </v>

198
00:11:20.151 --> 00:11:21.610
<v Speaker 1>third person singular forum.</v>

199
00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:23.023
<v Speaker 1>And onto the next sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're making a good of still being at </v>

200
00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:30.380
<v Speaker 1>this means I've lost my car keys work </v>
<v Speaker 1>for words of car.</v>

201
00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:31.273
<v Speaker 1>My key have been lost to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This pattern here of plus a noun plus </v>

202
00:11:36.561 --> 00:11:37.394
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now is a typical way of showing </v>

203
00:11:38.631 --> 00:11:41.120
<v Speaker 1>possession or connection between two </v>
<v Speaker 1>nouns,</v>

204
00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:44.270
<v Speaker 1>and this is a verb with these two root </v>
<v Speaker 1>consonants,</v>

205
00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:45.313
<v Speaker 1>which mean to lose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this particular verb template makes </v>

206
00:11:47.781 --> 00:11:51.200
<v Speaker 1>it reflexive or intransitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what means to be lost?</v>

207
00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:52.063
<v Speaker 1>This is the conjunct form of the which </v>
<v Speaker 1>can be used like the present perfect in </v>

208
00:11:55.451 --> 00:11:56.284
<v Speaker 1>English and this ending here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean something like happened to me </v>

209
00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:01.390
<v Speaker 1>showing that the speaker is affected by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the action.</v>

210
00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:04.720
<v Speaker 1>Notice that in this sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the word for key is singular.</v>

211
00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:08.650
<v Speaker 1>Plural can often be understood from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>context even if you're used the singular</v>

212
00:12:08.651 --> 00:12:09.484
<v Speaker 1>form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we can also use an explicit plural </v>

213
00:12:11.111 --> 00:12:15.210
<v Speaker 1>form of Tau Vignette.</v>

214
00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:17.710
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this means I've lost my car keys,</v>

215
00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:18.603
<v Speaker 1>but here you can see that a plural </v>
<v Speaker 1>ending has been added to the word for </v>

216
00:12:21.041 --> 00:12:21.874
<v Speaker 1>key,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not entirely necessary to use </v>

217
00:12:23.651 --> 00:12:24.484
<v Speaker 1>the plural form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can use the singular form and it </v>

218
00:12:26.261 --> 00:12:27.094
<v Speaker 1>context.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It should be clear whether you're </v>

219
00:12:28.061 --> 00:12:28.894
<v Speaker 1>talking about just one or many and onto </v>
<v Speaker 1>the next sentence and Magoo and no </v>

220
00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:36.700
<v Speaker 1>deadline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means we love Ethiopian cuisine.</v>

221
00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:40.480
<v Speaker 1>Word for word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's of Ethiopia food we love.</v>

222
00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:41.493
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see that pattern showing possession </v>

223
00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:43.743
<v Speaker 1>or relationship between two nouns and </v>
<v Speaker 1>here we see the imperfect form of the </v>

224
00:12:47.081 --> 00:12:48.430
<v Speaker 1>verb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning to love.</v>

225
00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:49.293
<v Speaker 1>Here's the stem and she wrote the </v>
<v Speaker 1>affixes telling us that this is first </v>

226
00:12:52.091 --> 00:12:53.650
<v Speaker 1>person plural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

227
00:12:53.651 --> 00:12:57.670
<v Speaker 1>the we form and one more sentence that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it took going,</v>

228
00:12:57.780 --> 00:12:58.613
<v Speaker 1>that's a better outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means I didn't break the vase that </v>

229
00:13:01.191 --> 00:13:02.020
<v Speaker 1>it going.</v>

230
00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:04.660
<v Speaker 1>That's a better word for word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's veys.</v>

231
00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:06.003
<v Speaker 1>I broke negative conjugation in Amharic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a special negative perfect form </v>

232
00:13:10.061 --> 00:13:12.550
<v Speaker 1>of verbs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The negative form is made by adding this</v>

233
00:13:12.551 --> 00:13:15.430
<v Speaker 1>prefix and the suffix to the regular </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect for them.</v>

234
00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:19.540
<v Speaker 1>And here's the word for veys and here </v>
<v Speaker 1>are the definite article suffix,</v>

235
00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:20.463
<v Speaker 1>but since it's following another vowel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's written as well rather than Ooh as </v>

236
00:13:25.901 --> 00:13:26.734
<v Speaker 1>a Semitic language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>amharic has some vocabulary that </v>

237
00:13:28.721 --> 00:13:32.170
<v Speaker 1>overlaps with other Semitic languages </v>
<v Speaker 1>like Hebrew and Arabic.</v>

238
00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:33.183
<v Speaker 1>Some of the similar words are loan words</v>
<v Speaker 1>from other languages like Arabic or </v>

239
00:13:36.191 --> 00:13:37.024
<v Speaker 1>gays,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some are cognates that develop from </v>

240
00:13:38.891 --> 00:13:41.950
<v Speaker 1>a common ancestor as the words and other</v>
<v Speaker 1>Semitic languages.</v>

241
00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:42.813
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes it's hard to know if the </v>
<v Speaker 1>word is a lone word or an original </v>

242
00:13:45.221 --> 00:13:46.990
<v Speaker 1>cognate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

243
00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:50.910
<v Speaker 1>the word we saw before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means break the same.</v>

244
00:13:50.911 --> 00:13:54.010
<v Speaker 1>The third person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect form and Hebrew would be Shavaya</v>

245
00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:55.173
<v Speaker 1>and in Hebrew sometimes the second route</v>
<v Speaker 1>letter like a v sound is doubled and </v>

246
00:13:58.391 --> 00:13:59.224
<v Speaker 1>pronounced like a b sound,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which makes the similarity even more </v>

247
00:14:01.511 --> 00:14:02.344
<v Speaker 1>obvious.</v>

248
00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:06.700
<v Speaker 1>And we also solve the work to kill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the third person.</v>

249
00:14:06.701 --> 00:14:08.320
<v Speaker 1>Perfect form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Hebrew,</v>

250
00:14:08.321 --> 00:14:11.980
<v Speaker 1>it's cattal meaning to slay or to kill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Arabic,</v>

251
00:14:11.981 --> 00:14:12.814
<v Speaker 1>it's clicky law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The consonants here are not exactly the </v>

252
00:14:15.251 --> 00:14:17.470
<v Speaker 1>same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think there's a connection between</v>

253
00:14:17.471 --> 00:14:21.580
<v Speaker 1>the g sound in Amharic and the cup or </v>
<v Speaker 1>sounds in the other languages.</v>

254
00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:22.473
<v Speaker 1>And I think there's a connection between</v>
<v Speaker 1>the de and the sounds in the other </v>

255
00:14:25.271 --> 00:14:26.770
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another example,</v>

256
00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:27.633
<v Speaker 1>the word for Berry in Hebrew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's havas and an Arabic of butter in </v>

257
00:14:34.301 --> 00:14:37.090
<v Speaker 1>Amharic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The verb meaning to here is sem,</v>

258
00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:39.490
<v Speaker 1>and this is the third person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perfect form,</v>

259
00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:42.940
<v Speaker 1>meaning he heard in Hebrew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Shama in Arabic,</v>

260
00:14:42.941 --> 00:14:43.774
<v Speaker 1>it's some off in Hebrew and Arabic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an extra route letter that was </v>

261
00:14:46.901 --> 00:14:47.734
<v Speaker 1>lost in the [inaudible] word and it has </v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly become silent and modern Hebrew </v>

262
00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:51.633
<v Speaker 1>but still written and I'm horic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The word for I is in Hebrew it's iron </v>

263
00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:57.403
<v Speaker 1>and in Arabic gets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I would love to be able to say </v>

264
00:14:59.811 --> 00:15:04.460
<v Speaker 1>that the English word I is related to </v>
<v Speaker 1>those but it's not another one.</v>

265
00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:07.040
<v Speaker 1>In Amharic there's theirs which means </v>
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>

266
00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:08.173
<v Speaker 1>In Hebrew it's bite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when it's used in a compound word </v>

267
00:15:10.461 --> 00:15:11.294
<v Speaker 1>with another noun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pronounced the bait like in </v>

268
00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:13.803
<v Speaker 1>Batesville,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the word force school in Arabic it's </v>

269
00:15:15.711 --> 00:15:16.544
<v Speaker 1>bait or bite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the amount of vocabulary that M </v>

270
00:15:20.341 --> 00:15:23.960
<v Speaker 1>Horak has in common with Hebrew and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Arabic might be less than you'd expect.</v>

271
00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:24.883
<v Speaker 1>That's partly because a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary is of Ku shidduch origin as </v>

272
00:15:28.011 --> 00:15:32.660
<v Speaker 1>much as 30% and other vocabulary is </v>
<v Speaker 1>unique to empiric or to Ethio.</v>

273
00:15:32.661 --> 00:15:33.494
<v Speaker 1>Semitic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amharic is a very interesting language </v>

274
00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:40.970
<v Speaker 1>and it's a language with clearly semitic</v>
<v Speaker 1>features including the verbal system and</v>

275
00:15:40.971 --> 00:15:44.870
<v Speaker 1>the root system using continental roots </v>
<v Speaker 1>and inserting them into templates.</v>

276
00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:45.793
<v Speaker 1>Those are things I'm familiar with from </v>
<v Speaker 1>other Semitic languages like Hebrew and </v>

277
00:15:48.321 --> 00:15:49.154
<v Speaker 1>Arabic and then include some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary we just looked at a second </v>

278
00:15:51.891 --> 00:15:52.724
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some elements are quite different </v>

279
00:15:53.811 --> 00:15:57.320
<v Speaker 1>from other Semitic languages such as its</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sov word order.</v>

280
00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:00.710
<v Speaker 1>Amharic is a language that I would love </v>
<v Speaker 1>to dig into more in the future.</v>

281
00:16:00.711 --> 00:16:04.550
<v Speaker 1>At some point in my last video on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Japanese,</v>

282
00:16:04.551 --> 00:16:08.240
<v Speaker 1>I forgot to ask a question of the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So today I'm not going to forget.</v>

283
00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:11.630
<v Speaker 1>Here is the question of the day for </v>
<v Speaker 1>speakers of M Horak.</v>

284
00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:15.860
<v Speaker 1>How widely is amharic spoken in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>area and your community and if you're an</v>

285
00:16:15.861 --> 00:16:18.770
<v Speaker 1>immigrant from Ethiopia living somewhere</v>
<v Speaker 1>else in the world,</v>

286
00:16:18.771 --> 00:16:22.040
<v Speaker 1>what language do members of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>community normally speak with each other</v>

287
00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:24.790
<v Speaker 1>and for speakers of other Semitic </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages?</v>

288
00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:27.970
<v Speaker 1>Have you noticed the similarities </v>
<v Speaker 1>between m horic and your language?</v>

289
00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:30.310
<v Speaker 1>What sorts of similarities have you </v>
<v Speaker 1>noticed?</v>

290
00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:32.650
<v Speaker 1>Be sure to follow Lang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>focus on facebook,</v>

291
00:16:32.651 --> 00:16:33.940
<v Speaker 1>twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and instagram.</v>

292
00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:37.600
<v Speaker 1>And once again I want to say thank you </v>
<v Speaker 1>to all of my patrion supporters,</v>

293
00:16:37.601 --> 00:16:38.434
<v Speaker 1>especially these wonderful people right </v>
<v Speaker 1>here on the screen for their monthly </v>

294
00:16:41.501 --> 00:16:42.334
<v Speaker 1>pledges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for watching and have a nice </v>

295
00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:45.933
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

296
00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:46.903
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
