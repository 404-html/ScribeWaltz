00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:09.863
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and </v>

4
00:00:11.611 --> 00:00:12.444
<v Speaker 1>my name is Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today we'll be answering the question </v>

5
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:15.653
<v Speaker 1>how similar our Spanish and Italian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spanish and Italian are both members of </v>

6
00:00:19.381 --> 00:00:20.214
<v Speaker 1>the romance language family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which developed from dialects of vulgar </v>

7
00:00:22.831 --> 00:00:23.664
<v Speaker 1>Latin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which were spoken throughout the Roman </v>

8
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.153
<v Speaker 1>Empire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For more information on their history </v>

9
00:00:27.151 --> 00:00:27.984
<v Speaker 1>and development,</v>
<v Speaker 1>check out my video on the romance </v>

10
00:00:29.491 --> 00:00:33.330
<v Speaker 1>language family right here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like any pair of romance languages.</v>

11
00:00:33.331 --> 00:00:34.164
<v Speaker 1>Spanish and Italian have a lot in common</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they are mutually intelligible to </v>

12
00:00:37.171 --> 00:00:38.004
<v Speaker 1>some extent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in the written form and when </v>

13
00:00:40.171 --> 00:00:41.004
<v Speaker 1>spoken slowly and clearly some speakers </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Spanish and Italian report that they </v>

14
00:00:44.551 --> 00:00:45.384
<v Speaker 1>are able to have extended conversations </v>
<v Speaker 1>with speakers of the other language </v>

15
00:00:48.511 --> 00:00:49.344
<v Speaker 1>provided that they both speak slowly and</v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly and they stopped to clarify </v>

16
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.410
<v Speaker 1>unfamiliar vocabulary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but despite their similarity,</v>

17
00:00:55.411 --> 00:00:58.080
<v Speaker 1>Spanish and Italian are also different </v>
<v Speaker 1>in many ways.</v>

18
00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.003
<v Speaker 1>Let's examine both of the languages </v>
<v Speaker 1>together and we'll see just what's </v>

19
00:01:01.321 --> 00:01:02.760
<v Speaker 1>similar and different above them.</v>

20
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.863
<v Speaker 1>Vocabulary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spanish and Italian have about 82 </v>

21
00:01:06.151 --> 00:01:06.984
<v Speaker 1>percent lexical similarity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means that 82 percent of the words </v>

22
00:01:10.051 --> 00:01:13.710
<v Speaker 1>in either language will have cognate </v>
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary in the other language.</v>

23
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.000
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at some examples of Spanish </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Italian cognates in Italian,</v>

24
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.923
<v Speaker 1>Jada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dino,</v>

25
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.340
<v Speaker 1>and in Spanish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How these means garden in Italian postal</v>

26
00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.370
<v Speaker 1>and in Spanish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wisdom.</v>

27
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.750
<v Speaker 1>This means place in Italian fjord and in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spanish,</v>

28
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.690
<v Speaker 1>Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means flower in Italian,</v>

29
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.913
<v Speaker 1>bobby Lee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in Spanish probably this means </v>

30
00:01:37.591 --> 00:01:42.120
<v Speaker 1>probable or likely in Italian and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>Spanish.</v>

31
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.680
<v Speaker 1>What this means port,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those pairs of words are quite obvious.</v>

32
00:01:46.681 --> 00:01:47.514
<v Speaker 1>Cognates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at a couple of less obvious </v>

33
00:01:49.201 --> 00:01:51.380
<v Speaker 1>cognates as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Italian feeding,</v>

34
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.540
<v Speaker 1>you in Spanish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>equal in Italian,</v>

35
00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.820
<v Speaker 1>he avi in Spanish or in Italian?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Up ended Spanish.</v>

36
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.163
<v Speaker 1>Gotcha.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now let's look at a couple of sentences </v>

37
00:02:03.691 --> 00:02:05.520
<v Speaker 1>to see how many of the words are </v>
<v Speaker 1>similar.</v>

38
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.840
<v Speaker 1>First in Spanish is still agenda and an </v>
<v Speaker 1>Italian stone agenda on porn.</v>

39
00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.430
<v Speaker 1>Liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means I'm reading a good book,</v>

40
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:15.503
<v Speaker 1>so when these two sentences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of the vocabulary is equivalent or </v>

41
00:02:17.941 --> 00:02:20.640
<v Speaker 1>cognate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another example in Spanish,</v>

42
00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.810
<v Speaker 1>and she took him yet in Italian ob zone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll notice all these sentences mean I</v>

43
00:02:28.111 --> 00:02:28.944
<v Speaker 1>need to change a little money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way to express need is different </v>

44
00:02:31.591 --> 00:02:32.424
<v Speaker 1>than the two sentences in Spanish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet necessito and in Italian it's ob </v>

45
00:02:36.331 --> 00:02:37.770
<v Speaker 1>zone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your d in Spanish,</v>

46
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.230
<v Speaker 1>the way to say a little is wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>buckle.</v>

47
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.820
<v Speaker 1>In Italian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's wouldn't pull.</v>

48
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.130
<v Speaker 1>In Italian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can also say wouldn't buckle,</v>

49
00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.580
<v Speaker 1>which is correct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's more common to say,</v>

50
00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.600
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't pull next the preposition like </v>
<v Speaker 1>have his day in Spanish and it's deep.</v>

51
00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:52.523
<v Speaker 1>In Italian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the word for money is in Spanish and </v>

52
00:02:55.321 --> 00:02:59.140
<v Speaker 1>it's solid in Italian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in this case you can see that some of</v>

53
00:02:59.141 --> 00:03:01.390
<v Speaker 1>the vocabulary is the same or </v>
<v Speaker 1>equivalent,</v>

54
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:02.350
<v Speaker 1>but not all of it.</v>

55
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.500
<v Speaker 1>And one more example in Spanish and in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Italian Dayville Trovata.</v>

56
00:03:08.001 --> 00:03:08.834
<v Speaker 1>When a banker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these sentences mean I need to find a </v>

57
00:03:11.021 --> 00:03:13.750
<v Speaker 1>bank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In these sentences we see need expressed</v>

58
00:03:13.751 --> 00:03:16.060
<v Speaker 1>in different ways than in the last pair </v>
<v Speaker 1>of sentences.</v>

59
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.700
<v Speaker 1>In Spanish it's tango,</v>
<v Speaker 1>k,</v>

60
00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.400
<v Speaker 1>in Italian it's devil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in Spanish it's also possible to say</v>

61
00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:22.293
<v Speaker 1>table and obvious cognitive devil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The word meaning to find is also </v>

62
00:03:25.631 --> 00:03:27.280
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Spanish it's English,</v>

63
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.833
<v Speaker 1>but in Italian it's Audi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually the Spanish word can also mean </v>

64
00:03:31.871 --> 00:03:34.030
<v Speaker 1>to meet and there's a different Italian </v>
<v Speaker 1>word,</v>

65
00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.260
<v Speaker 1>England throughout it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a cognitive angle,</v>

66
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.920
<v Speaker 1>but it only means to meet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to find.</v>

67
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.100
<v Speaker 1>Next you can see that the words for bank</v>
<v Speaker 1>are cognates,</v>

68
00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.170
<v Speaker 1>but interestingly they have different </v>
<v Speaker 1>gender.</v>

69
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:45.880
<v Speaker 1>In Spanish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's masculine,</v>

70
00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.580
<v Speaker 1>which we can see from the article soon </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the Oh,</v>

71
00:03:48.581 --> 00:03:51.220
<v Speaker 1>at the end of uncle and an Italian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's feminine,</v>

72
00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.920
<v Speaker 1>which we can see from the article Una </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the a at the end of bunker.</v>

73
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.433
<v Speaker 1>So from these examples we can see that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of crossover between </v>

74
00:03:58.781 --> 00:04:01.270
<v Speaker 1>Spanish vocabulary and Italian </v>
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary,</v>

75
00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.470
<v Speaker 1>but there are also some false friends to</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch out for false friends.</v>

76
00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.073
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean to face to people who talk </v>

77
00:04:09.461 --> 00:04:12.470
<v Speaker 1>behind your back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean words that look and sound similar</v>

78
00:04:12.471 --> 00:04:14.980
<v Speaker 1>and either language and likely share a </v>
<v Speaker 1>common origin,</v>

79
00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.830
<v Speaker 1>but they have a different meaning or </v>
<v Speaker 1>usage in each language.</v>

80
00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:19.720
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Spanish,</v>

81
00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.670
<v Speaker 1>but on the door mean soon in Italian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put on top means ready in Spanish.</v>

82
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.110
<v Speaker 1>Whether that means to keep or to guard </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Italian Guata dot,</v>

83
00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:33.610
<v Speaker 1>it means to look at in Spanish means </v>
<v Speaker 1>office.</v>

84
00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:36.160
<v Speaker 1>In Italian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oficina means workshop.</v>

85
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:37.143
<v Speaker 1>There's a different word in Italian you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means office in Spanish means </v>

86
00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.940
<v Speaker 1>pregnant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in Italian means embarrassed.</v>

87
00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.540
<v Speaker 1>False friends like these are a common </v>
<v Speaker 1>source of confusion for people who learn</v>

88
00:04:49.541 --> 00:04:50.950
<v Speaker 1>a language that's similar to one.</v>

89
00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:54.100
<v Speaker 1>They already know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we only look at lexical similarity,</v>

90
00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.490
<v Speaker 1>Spanish has more in common with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese than it does with the Italian</v>

91
00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.730
<v Speaker 1>and the Italian has more in common with </v>
<v Speaker 1>French than it does with Spanish.</v>

92
00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.880
<v Speaker 1>In either case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's 89 percent lexical similarity,</v>

93
00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.930
<v Speaker 1>but Spanish and Italian are more similar</v>
<v Speaker 1>and pronunciation than those other pairs</v>

94
00:05:07.931 --> 00:05:11.230
<v Speaker 1>of languages which can sometimes lead to</v>
<v Speaker 1>more intelligibility.</v>

95
00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.260
<v Speaker 1>Pronunciation Spanish has five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vowel sounds,</v>

96
00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:15.820
<v Speaker 1>a e,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a.</v>

97
00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:18.300
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Italian also has these five vowels.</v>

98
00:05:18.301 --> 00:05:22.510
<v Speaker 1>Sounds plus two additional ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Italian has to east sounds open.</v>

99
00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:27.540
<v Speaker 1>He at like the in bed and closed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He a like the vowel sound in say it also</v>

100
00:05:29.351 --> 00:05:30.011
<v Speaker 1>has to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

101
00:05:30.011 --> 00:05:31.340
<v Speaker 1>sounds open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

102
00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.240
<v Speaker 1>off like the Oh and pop and the closed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

103
00:05:34.241 --> 00:05:35.230
<v Speaker 1>sound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

104
00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.031
<v Speaker 1>like the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

105
00:05:36.031 --> 00:05:39.470
<v Speaker 1>and pope and both Spanish and Italian </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a similar role.</v>

106
00:05:39.471 --> 00:05:40.304
<v Speaker 1>Take our sound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One notable difference between Spanish </v>

107
00:05:43.661 --> 00:05:47.800
<v Speaker 1>and Italian pronunciation is that almost</v>
<v Speaker 1>all Italian words end in a vowel,</v>

108
00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.540
<v Speaker 1>but in Spanish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not the case.</v>

109
00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.060
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Italian custody,</v>

110
00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.073
<v Speaker 1>which means to cost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in Spanish it's goes to the Italian </v>

111
00:05:56.501 --> 00:05:57.334
<v Speaker 1>word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ends in a vowel while the Spanish word </v>

112
00:05:58.551 --> 00:06:00.680
<v Speaker 1>ends in a continent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you watch out for this,</v>

113
00:06:00.681 --> 00:06:01.514
<v Speaker 1>you'll notice it quite a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pronunciation and orthography in both </v>

114
00:06:04.551 --> 00:06:05.384
<v Speaker 1>Spanish and Italian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>C and g become soft when followed by I </v>

115
00:06:08.721 --> 00:06:09.554
<v Speaker 1>or II,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the soft sound is different in each </v>

116
00:06:11.361 --> 00:06:12.830
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Spanish,</v>

117
00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:16.580
<v Speaker 1>the soft see sounds like thug or sung.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Italian,</v>

118
00:06:16.581 --> 00:06:17.414
<v Speaker 1>it sounds like in Spanish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the soft g sounds like in Italian it </v>

119
00:06:21.981 --> 00:06:24.020
<v Speaker 1>sounds like Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

120
00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:24.913
<v Speaker 1>in Spanish and in Italian to Ta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this means city in Spanish and it means </v>

121
00:06:32.211 --> 00:06:36.560
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in Italian it's Gente in Spanish,</v>

122
00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:40.400
<v Speaker 1>and it either means general.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Italian it's Gen ed Ali.</v>

123
00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.970
<v Speaker 1>Some words like those above are </v>
<v Speaker 1>cognates.</v>

124
00:06:43.971 --> 00:06:47.030
<v Speaker 1>That sound different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are other words that sound similar</v>

125
00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:49.670
<v Speaker 1>but have to be written differently to </v>
<v Speaker 1>reflect their sound.</v>

126
00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:54.350
<v Speaker 1>The word for what in Spanish is k </v>
<v Speaker 1>spelled with q and an Italian.</v>

127
00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:57.170
<v Speaker 1>It's k spelled with a c,</v>
<v Speaker 1>H in Spanish.</v>

128
00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.110
<v Speaker 1>If you want to have the hard c sound </v>
<v Speaker 1>before I or II,</v>

129
00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:02.480
<v Speaker 1>you have to spell it as q.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You in Italian,</v>

130
00:07:02.481 --> 00:07:06.650
<v Speaker 1>you have to spell it as c,</v>
<v Speaker 1>h and while c h always represents a hard</v>

131
00:07:06.651 --> 00:07:11.090
<v Speaker 1>c sound and Italian and Spanish at </v>
<v Speaker 1>represents the sound like an English,</v>

132
00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:15.230
<v Speaker 1>so in Italian you have joke gelatto </v>
<v Speaker 1>spelled with cei at the beginning,</v>

133
00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:18.300
<v Speaker 1>but in Spanish you have that day spelled</v>
<v Speaker 1>with C,</v>

134
00:07:18.301 --> 00:07:22.460
<v Speaker 1>h in Spanish you have wonder meaning </v>
<v Speaker 1>when and Glenda,</v>

135
00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:23.503
<v Speaker 1>meaning how much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in Italian you have quandl and </v>

136
00:07:25.911 --> 00:07:29.030
<v Speaker 1>quantile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Spanish you can't write it with q you</v>

137
00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:31.460
<v Speaker 1>because that always represents a hard c </v>
<v Speaker 1>sound,</v>

138
00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:34.560
<v Speaker 1>so the words would end up sounding like </v>
<v Speaker 1>a and comfortable.</v>

139
00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:35.713
<v Speaker 1>Some of the differences in pronunciation</v>
<v Speaker 1>and orthography between Spanish and </v>

140
00:07:38.571 --> 00:07:40.250
<v Speaker 1>Italian are fairly systematic.</v>

141
00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:43.010
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he in Italian often becomes,</v>

142
00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:47.390
<v Speaker 1>I eat in Spanish for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Temple becomes the MPO.</v>

143
00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:51.380
<v Speaker 1>Then day becomes the ending and went an </v>
<v Speaker 1>Italian.</v>

144
00:07:51.381 --> 00:07:52.214
<v Speaker 1>You Have Sc,</v>
<v Speaker 1>SF or sp or st at the beginning of a </v>

145
00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:58.310
<v Speaker 1>word in Spanish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are often proceeded by an IEP.</v>

146
00:07:59.150 --> 00:07:59.983
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] in Italian becomes as could </v>

147
00:08:02.401 --> 00:08:07.401
<v Speaker 1>to be in Spanish and especially in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Italian becomes a speciality in Spanish.</v>

148
00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:13.010
<v Speaker 1>One other thing to note is that double </v>
<v Speaker 1>consonants are very common in Italian,</v>

149
00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:15.680
<v Speaker 1>but in Spanish most consonants can't be </v>
<v Speaker 1>doubled.</v>

150
00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:18.800
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Italian got Dole means cat,</v>

151
00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:23.120
<v Speaker 1>but in Spanish it's that the end in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Italian means cup,</v>

152
00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:24.043
<v Speaker 1>but it's in Spanish grammar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The general word order of Spanish and </v>

153
00:08:28.821 --> 00:08:29.654
<v Speaker 1>Italian is very similar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have a look at these two sentences in </v>

154
00:08:32.331 --> 00:08:37.331
<v Speaker 1>Spanish and in Italian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Louis,</v>

155
00:08:37.431 --> 00:08:39.220
<v Speaker 1>no money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no money.</v>

156
00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:41.570
<v Speaker 1>You can see that there's some different </v>
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary,</v>

157
00:08:41.571 --> 00:08:43.400
<v Speaker 1>but the sentences are translatable.</v>

158
00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.860
<v Speaker 1>Word for word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Notice that in both languages,</v>

159
00:08:45.861 --> 00:08:46.694
<v Speaker 1>the subject Pronoun is normally optional</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the verb is conjugated for </v>

160
00:08:50.031 --> 00:08:50.864
<v Speaker 1>person and number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another example in Spanish or in </v>

161
00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:56.610
<v Speaker 1>Italian?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

162
00:08:56.630 --> 00:09:00.150
<v Speaker 1>your scrotum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means I wrote him a letter,</v>

163
00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:02.760
<v Speaker 1>so here hear the word order is still </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly the same,</v>

164
00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:06.330
<v Speaker 1>and notice that the object Pronoun comes</v>
<v Speaker 1>before the conjugated verb.</v>

165
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:09.090
<v Speaker 1>In this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the auxiliary verbs in both languages.</v>

166
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.700
<v Speaker 1>Italian grammar has a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>complications.</v>

167
00:09:11.701 --> 00:09:14.040
<v Speaker 1>That Spanish doesn't have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Articles,</v>

168
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:16.530
<v Speaker 1>articles in Italian or more complicated </v>
<v Speaker 1>than it.</v>

169
00:09:16.531 --> 00:09:19.020
<v Speaker 1>Spanish in Spanish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The indefinite articles,</v>

170
00:09:19.021 --> 00:09:23.160
<v Speaker 1>our own for masculine nouns and owner </v>
<v Speaker 1>for feminine nouns.</v>

171
00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:25.340
<v Speaker 1>Also in Italian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Oona Una,</v>

172
00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:29.430
<v Speaker 1>but boone becomes uno before words </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning and s or z,</v>

173
00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:33.900
<v Speaker 1>followed by another continent and Una </v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes an apostrophe before unowned,</v>

174
00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:36.440
<v Speaker 1>beginning with a vowel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so in Italian we have past,</v>

175
00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:42.120
<v Speaker 1>but we student debt and we have key ave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when Italiana,</v>

176
00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:43.433
<v Speaker 1>Spanish and Italian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both have four basic definite articles </v>

177
00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:46.590
<v Speaker 1>in Spanish.</v>

178
00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:50.310
<v Speaker 1>They are for masculine singular law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for feminine,</v>

179
00:09:50.311 --> 00:09:52.440
<v Speaker 1>singular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for masculine,</v>

180
00:09:52.441 --> 00:09:54.060
<v Speaker 1>plural,</v>
<v Speaker 1>less feminine,</v>

181
00:09:54.061 --> 00:09:57.120
<v Speaker 1>plural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Italian,</v>

182
00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:00.360
<v Speaker 1>the ill for masculine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>singular law for feminine,</v>

183
00:10:00.361 --> 00:10:02.550
<v Speaker 1>singular for masculine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plural,</v>

184
00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:03.653
<v Speaker 1>and lay for feminine plural,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it'll becomes low before words </v>

185
00:10:06.871 --> 00:10:07.704
<v Speaker 1>beginning with Srz plus another </v>
<v Speaker 1>continent and it becomes l apostrophe </v>

186
00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:16.220
<v Speaker 1>before a vowel and eat becomes leaky </v>
<v Speaker 1>before s or z plus another continent,</v>

187
00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:17.543
<v Speaker 1>so we have it'll pass support at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but law students which are both </v>

188
00:10:20.551 --> 00:10:21.384
<v Speaker 1>masculine singular and we have ipass it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the identity which are both </v>

189
00:10:25.771 --> 00:10:26.604
<v Speaker 1>masculine plural,</v>
<v Speaker 1>also both law and lay become l </v>

190
00:10:30.091 --> 00:10:33.870
<v Speaker 1>apostrophe before vowel possessive </v>
<v Speaker 1>pronouns.</v>

191
00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:36.930
<v Speaker 1>The way possessive pronouns are used is </v>
<v Speaker 1>also a little bit different.</v>

192
00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:38.003
<v Speaker 1>In Italian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>possessive pronouns are normally used </v>

193
00:10:39.601 --> 00:10:42.990
<v Speaker 1>together with a definite article except </v>
<v Speaker 1>when we talk about family members,</v>

194
00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:45.780
<v Speaker 1>but in Spanish the definite article is </v>
<v Speaker 1>not required.</v>

195
00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:49.530
<v Speaker 1>So in Italian you have Lamina beachy </v>
<v Speaker 1>collector and it's Spanish.</v>

196
00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:53.280
<v Speaker 1>You have music later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so notice in Spanish there's no definite</v>

197
00:10:53.281 --> 00:10:54.114
<v Speaker 1>article law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another difference to notice here is </v>

198
00:10:55.861 --> 00:10:56.694
<v Speaker 1>that in Spanish there is no distinction </v>
<v Speaker 1>between masculine and feminine </v>

199
00:10:59.221 --> 00:11:00.054
<v Speaker 1>possessive pronouns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Italian there's mia for feminine </v>

200
00:11:02.341 --> 00:11:04.860
<v Speaker 1>singular and meal for masculine </v>
<v Speaker 1>singular,</v>

201
00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:08.700
<v Speaker 1>but in Spanish there's just me for both </v>
<v Speaker 1>verbs.</v>

202
00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:09.653
<v Speaker 1>The verb tense is used and the way that </v>
<v Speaker 1>verbs are conjugated is really quite </v>

203
00:11:12.301 --> 00:11:14.190
<v Speaker 1>similar in both languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

204
00:11:14.191 --> 00:11:16.680
<v Speaker 1>the exact conjugations are not quite the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same,</v>

205
00:11:16.681 --> 00:11:18.930
<v Speaker 1>but they are fairly similar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's a sentence,</v>

206
00:11:18.931 --> 00:11:19.764
<v Speaker 1>meaning they will live in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The verb to live in Italian is vivacity </v>

207
00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:28.370
<v Speaker 1>and in Spanish it's Bev is the sentence </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Italian lovato and New York.</v>

208
00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:32.070
<v Speaker 1>In Spanish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just maybe then we can see that the</v>

209
00:11:32.071 --> 00:11:33.120
<v Speaker 1>third person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plural,</v>

210
00:11:33.121 --> 00:11:33.954
<v Speaker 1>future tense conjugation is similar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but notice that the Italian one ends in </v>

211
00:11:37.411 --> 00:11:38.244
<v Speaker 1>a double consonant and vowel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now let's look at a sentence in the </v>

212
00:11:41.071 --> 00:11:42.270
<v Speaker 1>past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the present,</v>

213
00:11:42.271 --> 00:11:42.660
<v Speaker 1>perfect.</v>

214
00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:43.493
<v Speaker 1>To be precise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sentence means she bought too many </v>

215
00:11:45.331 --> 00:11:49.710
<v Speaker 1>things in Italian layout and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>Spanish.</v>

216
00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:55.070
<v Speaker 1>Yet the present perfect tense is formed </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same way in both languages.</v>

217
00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:57.760
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here is the auxiliary verb,</v>

218
00:11:57.761 --> 00:12:02.020
<v Speaker 1>meaning to have have edit in Italian or </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Spanish.</v>

219
00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:04.690
<v Speaker 1>That's followed by the past participle </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the verb,</v>

220
00:12:04.691 --> 00:12:09.691
<v Speaker 1>meaning to buy [inaudible] in Italian </v>
<v Speaker 1>and in Spanish.</v>

221
00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:13.780
<v Speaker 1>One thing to note about the present </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect tense is that an Italian,</v>

222
00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:17.230
<v Speaker 1>most verbs take the auxiliary verb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aveda to have,</v>

223
00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:21.360
<v Speaker 1>but some verbs take std meaning to be as</v>
<v Speaker 1>their auxiliary verb.</v>

224
00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:22.383
<v Speaker 1>That's similar to in French,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in Spanish the only auxiliary verb </v>

225
00:12:24.941 --> 00:12:28.990
<v Speaker 1>is I've added meaning to have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so in Italian there's a in Toronto,</v>

226
00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:32.510
<v Speaker 1>meaning he entered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in Spanish it's I am data.</v>

227
00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:34.383
<v Speaker 1>Those are just a couple of examples,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but basically all verb tenses and all </v>

228
00:12:37.331 --> 00:12:38.164
<v Speaker 1>verb forms have an equivalent or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>parallel in the other language bringing </v>

229
00:12:41.141 --> 00:12:41.974
<v Speaker 1>it altogether.</v>

230
00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:45.370
<v Speaker 1>Let's just look at a couple more </v>
<v Speaker 1>sentences and see what we find along the</v>

231
00:12:45.371 --> 00:12:46.204
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This sentence means Maria is less </v>

232
00:12:47.861 --> 00:12:52.861
<v Speaker 1>intelligent than her sister in Spanish </v>
<v Speaker 1>as is of manner and an Italian mother.</v>

233
00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:55.843
<v Speaker 1>Men though he did the suicide ella.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here we can see that the word order is </v>

234
00:12:59.381 --> 00:13:02.650
<v Speaker 1>the same and we can basically translate </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sentence is word for word.</v>

235
00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:06.010
<v Speaker 1>The third person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>female form of the verb to be is similar</v>

236
00:13:06.011 --> 00:13:06.844
<v Speaker 1>but slightly different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The word for less is similar but </v>

237
00:13:09.521 --> 00:13:12.670
<v Speaker 1>slightly different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The word for intelligent is similar,</v>

238
00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:16.810
<v Speaker 1>but in Spanish the g sound is softened </v>
<v Speaker 1>to a cup while an Italian,</v>

239
00:13:16.811 --> 00:13:20.310
<v Speaker 1>it's softened to a job and the Italian </v>
<v Speaker 1>word has a doubled l.</v>

240
00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:24.340
<v Speaker 1>The preposition used is also different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The possessive Pronoun is similar,</v>

241
00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:25.203
<v Speaker 1>but in Spanish there is no gender </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinction and the word for sister is </v>

242
00:13:28.061 --> 00:13:31.600
<v Speaker 1>different in the two languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you can see,</v>

243
00:13:31.601 --> 00:13:32.434
<v Speaker 1>Spanish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Italian have a lot of similarities </v>

244
00:13:33.851 --> 00:13:35.740
<v Speaker 1>including basically the same word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>order,</v>

245
00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:36.603
<v Speaker 1>similar grammar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of similar vocabulary and </v>

246
00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.140
<v Speaker 1>generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>similar pronunciation,</v>

247
00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:43.090
<v Speaker 1>but there are still significant </v>
<v Speaker 1>differences,</v>

248
00:13:43.091 --> 00:13:46.330
<v Speaker 1>particularly in vocabulary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pronunciation and slash or photography.</v>

249
00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:50.170
<v Speaker 1>They are different enough that they are </v>
<v Speaker 1>unmistakably two different languages,</v>

250
00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:51.033
<v Speaker 1>but they're similar enough that there is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a certain degree of mutual </v>

251
00:13:53.171 --> 00:13:54.004
<v Speaker 1>intelligibility and that degree of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mutual intelligibility can probably be </v>

252
00:13:57.370 --> 00:14:00.760
<v Speaker 1>greatly increased by studying even the </v>
<v Speaker 1>basics of the other language,</v>

253
00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:01.713
<v Speaker 1>but producing the other language </v>
<v Speaker 1>accurately is obviously another matter </v>

254
00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:06.610
<v Speaker 1>and that would require dedicated study.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

255
00:14:06.611 --> 00:14:09.730
<v Speaker 1>The question of the day for native </v>
<v Speaker 1>speakers of Spanish and Italian,</v>

256
00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:10.593
<v Speaker 1>how well can you understand the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>language both in speech and in writing </v>

257
00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:14.313
<v Speaker 1>and have you ever tried to converse with</v>
<v Speaker 1>a speaker of the other language using </v>

258
00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:18.063
<v Speaker 1>only your native languages?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did that work out and for learners </v>

259
00:14:20.711 --> 00:14:21.544
<v Speaker 1>of Spanish and Italian?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much does your knowledge of one of </v>

260
00:14:23.441 --> 00:14:25.750
<v Speaker 1>those languages help you make sense of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the other?</v>

261
00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:28.780
