00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.073
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and </v>

2
00:00:02.911 --> 00:00:03.744
<v Speaker 1>my name is Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today I want to start this video with a </v>

3
00:00:06.721 --> 00:00:07.554
<v Speaker 1>new feature called the mystery language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to play a language for you </v>

4
00:00:11.161 --> 00:00:11.994
<v Speaker 1>that you may have not heard before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and at the end of the video I will let </v>

5
00:00:14.461 --> 00:00:16.650
<v Speaker 1>you know what this language is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So check it out</v>

6
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:20.453
<v Speaker 2>a sas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the gus and Alisa Fallon trying to </v>

7
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:32.270
<v Speaker 2>date must watch away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mislead it's live.</v>

8
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.853
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stay tuned until the end of the video </v>

9
00:00:42.121 --> 00:00:44.370
<v Speaker 1>and I will tell you what language you </v>
<v Speaker 1>just heard.</v>

10
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.230
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Onto our main topic.</v>

11
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.810
<v Speaker 1>What country has the most languages </v>
<v Speaker 1>spoken?</v>

12
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.840
<v Speaker 1>What country is the most linguistically </v>
<v Speaker 1>diverse?</v>

13
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:52.793
<v Speaker 1>Many of us come from countries where </v>
<v Speaker 1>there may just be one or two main </v>

14
00:00:55.291 --> 00:00:58.410
<v Speaker 1>languages and maybe some other regional </v>
<v Speaker 1>minority languages too,</v>

15
00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:59.483
<v Speaker 1>but there are some countries in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world where the amount of linguistic </v>

16
00:01:01.801 --> 00:01:02.634
<v Speaker 1>variation is just mindblowing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The country with the most languages </v>

17
00:01:05.911 --> 00:01:10.911
<v Speaker 1>spoken is Papa New Guinea with at least </v>
<v Speaker 1>820 different languages spoken.</v>

18
00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.060
<v Speaker 1>Imagined that upload.</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Guinea is a very rural country where</v>

19
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.923
<v Speaker 1>88 percent of the people live in rural </v>
<v Speaker 1>areas now compare that to 10 percent of </v>

20
00:01:19.621 --> 00:01:20.454
<v Speaker 1>the people in the United Kingdom living </v>
<v Speaker 1>in rural areas for 19 point three </v>

21
00:01:23.521 --> 00:01:26.760
<v Speaker 1>percent of the American population </v>
<v Speaker 1>living in rural areas.</v>

22
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:27.743
<v Speaker 1>Papa New Guinea is very rural indeed and</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of Papa New Guinea is rugged </v>

23
00:01:31.321 --> 00:01:32.154
<v Speaker 1>terrain and it's deep valleys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a limited amount of </v>

24
00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.140
<v Speaker 1>communication between all of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>isolated rural community.</v>

25
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.303
<v Speaker 1>That's why they're remained such an </v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing amount of linguistic variety </v>

26
00:01:41.011 --> 00:01:41.844
<v Speaker 1>today without any particular languages </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of growing in influence and </v>

27
00:01:45.031 --> 00:01:45.864
<v Speaker 1>dominating the others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You imagined that your village speaks </v>

28
00:01:48.031 --> 00:01:51.270
<v Speaker 1>one language and the neighboring village</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a few kilometers away,</v>

29
00:01:51.271 --> 00:01:55.200
<v Speaker 1>speaks an entirely different language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's sometimes the case in top one new</v>

30
00:01:55.201 --> 00:01:57.540
<v Speaker 1>Guinea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not even talking about different</v>

31
00:01:57.541 --> 00:02:00.300
<v Speaker 1>dialects of the same language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although that happens too.</v>

32
00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about completely different </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>

33
00:02:03.091 --> 00:02:03.924
<v Speaker 1>In certain cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the languages of New Guinea fall into </v>

34
00:02:06.331 --> 00:02:07.164
<v Speaker 1>three categories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first one is the Austronesian </v>

35
00:02:09.061 --> 00:02:09.894
<v Speaker 1>languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which arrived in Papa New Guinea about </v>

36
00:02:11.641 --> 00:02:13.290
<v Speaker 1>3,500</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

37
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.940
<v Speaker 1>Then there are the top one languages </v>
<v Speaker 1>which predate the Austronesian languages</v>

38
00:02:17.941 --> 00:02:18.960
<v Speaker 1>in Buffalo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Guinea,</v>

39
00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.973
<v Speaker 1>and then there are the foreign languages</v>
<v Speaker 1>and creole languages that serve as </v>

40
00:02:22.711 --> 00:02:23.544
<v Speaker 1>Lingua Franca.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The term pop one language simply refers </v>

41
00:02:26.191 --> 00:02:29.010
<v Speaker 1>to languages that predate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Austronesian languages,</v>

42
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.650
<v Speaker 1>languages that are indigenous to pop one</v>
<v Speaker 1>new beginnings.</v>

43
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.440
<v Speaker 1>It does not mean that they are a single </v>
<v Speaker 1>language family.</v>

44
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:35.363
<v Speaker 1>There are actually several dozen </v>
<v Speaker 1>different language families amongst the </v>

45
00:02:37.661 --> 00:02:38.494
<v Speaker 1>pop one languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of those language families have no </v>

46
00:02:40.591 --> 00:02:43.650
<v Speaker 1>connection to each other and there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>some language isolates.</v>

47
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:44.663
<v Speaker 1>That means that there are individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages that have no known connection </v>

48
00:02:47.791 --> 00:02:48.624
<v Speaker 1>to any other languages in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most pop one languages are spoken by </v>

49
00:02:51.751 --> 00:02:54.180
<v Speaker 1>only a few hundred to a few thousand </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

50
00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.180
<v Speaker 1>There are a few that are spoken by over </v>
<v Speaker 1>100,000</v>

51
00:02:57.181 --> 00:02:58.014
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are three official languages in </v>

52
00:02:59.051 --> 00:03:01.090
<v Speaker 1>Papua New Guinea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first one is English,</v>

53
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.850
<v Speaker 1>the second is talk piece in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the third one is he.</v>

54
00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:04.684
<v Speaker 1>The to the most widely spoken is top in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is an English creole language which </v>

55
00:03:08.501 --> 00:03:09.334
<v Speaker 1>arose during the colonial period,</v>
<v Speaker 1>top face and is now used as a Lingua </v>

56
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:13.623
<v Speaker 1>Franca,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is very important in a country </v>

57
00:03:14.381 --> 00:03:15.214
<v Speaker 1>with so many different languages and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is also now spoken as a native language </v>

58
00:03:18.671 --> 00:03:22.900
<v Speaker 1>by many people took in is less widely </v>
<v Speaker 1>spoken in the southern region of couple.</v>

59
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.840
<v Speaker 1>We're a different language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>often functions as the Lingua Franca,</v>

60
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.410
<v Speaker 1>and that is key.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The motu two is a simplified creole,</v>

61
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.120
<v Speaker 1>have another Austronesian language </v>
<v Speaker 1>called multi.</v>

62
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:33.183
<v Speaker 1>Its use has been declining in recent </v>
<v Speaker 1>times in favor of English and talk </v>

63
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.120
<v Speaker 1>English is only spoken by one to two </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent of the population,</v>

64
00:03:40.121 --> 00:03:44.800
<v Speaker 1>but it is widely used in business and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is supposedly the language of education,</v>

65
00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.120
<v Speaker 1>but if English is the language of </v>
<v Speaker 1>education and only one to two percent of</v>

66
00:03:49.121 --> 00:03:49.954
<v Speaker 1>the people speak it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that sounds like a pretty dodgy </v>

67
00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.530
<v Speaker 1>education system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To me.</v>

68
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.520
<v Speaker 1>The second most linguistically diverse </v>
<v Speaker 1>country in the world is Indonesia,</v>

69
00:03:57.521 --> 00:04:00.310
<v Speaker 1>which lives right next to Poplin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

70
00:04:00.311 --> 00:04:03.280
<v Speaker 1>half of the island of New Guinea lies </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside Indonesia.</v>

71
00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:06.940
<v Speaker 1>About 740 languages are spoken in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Indonesia,</v>

72
00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.893
<v Speaker 1>but there was only one official language</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Lingua Franca and that is Bahasa </v>

73
00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:13.143
<v Speaker 1>Indonesia or Indonesian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number three is Nigeria with 516 </v>

74
00:04:16.481 --> 00:04:19.930
<v Speaker 1>languages spoken,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but English is used as a Lingua Franca,</v>

75
00:04:19.931 --> 00:04:21.490
<v Speaker 1>especially in the urban areas.</v>

76
00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.420
<v Speaker 1>I guess they need English to communicate</v>
<v Speaker 1>with all those thieving oil companies.</v>

77
00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:26.313
<v Speaker 1>Number four is India with 427 languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The main Lingua Franca is our Hindi as </v>

78
00:04:31.481 --> 00:04:32.314
<v Speaker 1>well as English,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was left behind by the British </v>

79
00:04:34.271 --> 00:04:38.950
<v Speaker 1>colonizers in exchange for a massively </v>
<v Speaker 1>huge amounts of India's resources,</v>

80
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.910
<v Speaker 1>and number five is the USA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has 311 languages.</v>

81
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.833
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that may sound surprising because we </v>

82
00:04:45.131 --> 00:04:47.530
<v Speaker 1>think of the USA as an English speaking </v>
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>

83
00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:48.513
<v Speaker 1>but remember that there are over a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred indigenous languages in the USA </v>

84
00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.450
<v Speaker 1>even though many of them have a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>limited number of speakers these days.</v>

85
00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.620
<v Speaker 1>There are also a couple of hundred </v>
<v Speaker 1>different languages spoken by immigrants</v>

86
00:04:59.621 --> 00:05:00.454
<v Speaker 1>to the USA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It may be hard to wrap your head around </v>

87
00:05:02.741 --> 00:05:05.050
<v Speaker 1>that huge degree of linguistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>diversity,</v>

88
00:05:05.051 --> 00:05:08.530
<v Speaker 1>especially if you are interested in one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of those countries and you want to learn</v>

89
00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.750
<v Speaker 1>a language to communicate with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people there,</v>

90
00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.210
<v Speaker 1>but luckily those countries all have one</v>
<v Speaker 1>or more Lingua Franca,</v>

91
00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:18.460
<v Speaker 1>which can help you communicate with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>much larger proportion of the population</v>

92
00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.890
<v Speaker 1>from various different linguistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>communities.</v>
