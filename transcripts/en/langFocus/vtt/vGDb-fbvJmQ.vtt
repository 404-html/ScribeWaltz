00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:05.063
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and </v>

4
00:00:06.631 --> 00:00:10.380
<v Speaker 1>my name is Paul and despite what half </v>
<v Speaker 1>the people in the comments say,</v>

5
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.273
<v Speaker 1>English is my native language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why doesn't he show his birth </v>

6
00:00:14.551 --> 00:00:16.470
<v Speaker 1>certificate and you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish he would.</v>

7
00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.780
<v Speaker 1>He should show his birth certificate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other thing,</v>

8
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.420
<v Speaker 1>why doesn't he show his birth </v>
<v Speaker 1>certificate?</v>

9
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.590
<v Speaker 1>Today's topic is 10 common mistakes that</v>
<v Speaker 1>native English speakers make.</v>

10
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.540
<v Speaker 1>When most of us study a foreign </v>
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>

11
00:00:27.541 --> 00:00:30.090
<v Speaker 1>we try to avoid mistakes and speak </v>
<v Speaker 1>accurately.</v>

12
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.430
<v Speaker 1>Some of us are even scared to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>mistakes,</v>

13
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:33.323
<v Speaker 1>but you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even native speakers make mistakes and </v>

14
00:00:35.161 --> 00:00:36.870
<v Speaker 1>that includes speakers of my native </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

15
00:00:36.871 --> 00:00:38.460
<v Speaker 1>English.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I say mistakes,</v>

16
00:00:38.461 --> 00:00:40.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm not talking about dialectal </v>
<v Speaker 1>variation.</v>

17
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.680
<v Speaker 1>English has various dialects that differ</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the standard language,</v>

18
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.450
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not talking about those </v>
<v Speaker 1>differences.</v>

19
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about native speakers of </v>
<v Speaker 1>dialects that are very close to standard</v>

20
00:00:49.141 --> 00:00:50.730
<v Speaker 1>English,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but who make mistakes?</v>

21
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.410
<v Speaker 1>What kind of mistakes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

22
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.120
<v Speaker 1>here are 10 of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number 10,</v>

23
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.520
<v Speaker 1>unclear subject number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

24
00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.980
<v Speaker 1>every one of those people need to buy a </v>
<v Speaker 1>ticket.</v>

25
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:00.443
<v Speaker 1>The correct sentence would be every one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of those people needs to buy a ticket </v>

26
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.730
<v Speaker 1>because the plural word people is right </v>
<v Speaker 1>next to the verb.</v>

27
00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.770
<v Speaker 1>Some people might mistake it for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>subject,</v>

28
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:08.813
<v Speaker 1>but the subject of the sentence is </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually every one of the people is </v>

29
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.120
<v Speaker 1>extra information about that subject.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone is singular.</v>

30
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.040
<v Speaker 1>Number nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>confusing homophones.</v>

31
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.903
<v Speaker 1>When writing homophones are words that </v>
<v Speaker 1>sound the same as other words that have </v>

32
00:01:20.551 --> 00:01:22.710
<v Speaker 1>a different meaning and usually have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>different spelling.</v>

33
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.160
<v Speaker 1>One common example is the confusion of </v>
<v Speaker 1>effect and effect.</v>

34
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.233
<v Speaker 1>This confusion arises because the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>vowel of each word is often reduced and </v>

35
00:01:30.301 --> 00:01:31.134
<v Speaker 1>sounds like a Schwab and this makes them</v>
<v Speaker 1>sound like when someone's writing the </v>

36
00:01:33.931 --> 00:01:34.764
<v Speaker 1>word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they may be hearing the sound of the </v>

37
00:01:35.581 --> 00:01:36.414
<v Speaker 1>word in their head and they might choose</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wrong spelling to go with that </v>

38
00:01:38.581 --> 00:01:39.180
<v Speaker 1>sound.</v>

39
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.013
<v Speaker 1>Another example of this is they're there</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're there and they're sound the </v>

40
00:01:43.591 --> 00:01:44.430
<v Speaker 1>same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they are.</v>

41
00:01:44.431 --> 00:01:47.550
<v Speaker 1>Sounds a little different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in its reduced form basically sounds</v>

42
00:01:47.551 --> 00:01:49.440
<v Speaker 1>the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people often choose the wrong one.</v>

43
00:01:49.441 --> 00:01:50.274
<v Speaker 1>When writing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another example is the confusion of </v>

44
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.850
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the possessive Pronoun with your.</v>

45
00:01:53.851 --> 00:01:57.600
<v Speaker 1>The contraction of you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another example is writing of instead of</v>

46
00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.820
<v Speaker 1>Apostrophe v,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the contracted form of,</v>

47
00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:01.830
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone might write,</v>

48
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.960
<v Speaker 1>I would have gone to the party if I'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>had time,</v>

49
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.360
<v Speaker 1>but it should be would've with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Apostrophe v.</v>

50
00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.370
<v Speaker 1>They sound the same and casual </v>
<v Speaker 1>pronunciation,</v>

51
00:02:08.371 --> 00:02:10.260
<v Speaker 1>so that's why they get confused.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number eight,</v>

52
00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:12.930
<v Speaker 1>confusion of adjectives and adverbs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

53
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.450
<v Speaker 1>he's saying really good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good as an adjective,</v>

54
00:02:15.451 --> 00:02:19.110
<v Speaker 1>but we need an adverb to modify the verb</v>
<v Speaker 1>sang so the correct sentences.</v>

55
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:20.183
<v Speaker 1>He sang really well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This mistake is the mistake that kids </v>

56
00:02:23.221 --> 00:02:24.054
<v Speaker 1>often make before they've had English </v>
<v Speaker 1>grammar drilled into them and it's also </v>

57
00:02:26.431 --> 00:02:29.280
<v Speaker 1>the kind of mistake that less educated </v>
<v Speaker 1>people might make.</v>

58
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.620
<v Speaker 1>Even educated people might make this </v>
<v Speaker 1>mistake,</v>

59
00:02:31.621 --> 00:02:34.530
<v Speaker 1>but they'd probably notice it right away</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe correct themselves.</v>

60
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:35.483
<v Speaker 1>Another related cases that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes use an adverb when they </v>

61
00:02:37.621 --> 00:02:40.440
<v Speaker 1>actually need an adjective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So take this case for example.</v>

62
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.140
<v Speaker 1>I feel very badly about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The sentence is wrong.</v>

63
00:02:43.141 --> 00:02:45.300
<v Speaker 1>It should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel very bad about that,</v>

64
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.000
<v Speaker 1>but why is it wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought adverbs modify verb,</v>

65
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:49.140
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>adverbs,</v>

66
00:02:49.141 --> 00:02:52.200
<v Speaker 1>modify action verbs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but feel is a state of verb.</v>

67
00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.020
<v Speaker 1>It just describes the way something is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The state that it's in.</v>

68
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.530
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't describe an actual state of </v>
<v Speaker 1>verbs are followed by adjectives,</v>

69
00:02:58.531 --> 00:03:00.010
<v Speaker 1>not advert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Inevitably,</v>

70
00:03:00.011 --> 00:03:01.930
<v Speaker 1>someone will ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what about the sentence?</v>

71
00:03:01.931 --> 00:03:02.890
<v Speaker 1>I feel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

72
00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:04.390
<v Speaker 1>isn't that correct?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

73
00:03:04.391 --> 00:03:05.224
<v Speaker 1>that's a correct sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but well is not an adverb in that </v>

74
00:03:07.241 --> 00:03:08.074
<v Speaker 1>sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually an adjective meaning </v>

75
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.053
<v Speaker 1>healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the adverb equivalent of the </v>

76
00:03:11.831 --> 00:03:12.670
<v Speaker 1>adjective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

77
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.410
<v Speaker 1>Number seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>double negatives.</v>

78
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.980
<v Speaker 1>Most educated adults won't make this </v>
<v Speaker 1>mistake and if they do,</v>

79
00:03:17.981 --> 00:03:20.950
<v Speaker 1>it's probably kind of an intentional </v>
<v Speaker 1>casual style of speaking.</v>

80
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.600
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to sound all bad ass.</v>

81
00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.180
<v Speaker 1>A double negative is like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have no money,</v>

82
00:03:25.181 --> 00:03:26.014
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The correct sentence would be I don't </v>

83
00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:27.664
<v Speaker 1>have any money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

84
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:28.623
<v Speaker 1>Another example I didn't talk to nobody </v>
<v Speaker 1>correct sentence would be I didn't talk </v>

85
00:03:31.931 --> 00:03:32.764
<v Speaker 1>to anybody so that one could be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mistake or it could be people </v>

86
00:03:34.721 --> 00:03:35.554
<v Speaker 1>intentionally trying to copy the </v>
<v Speaker 1>features of a dialect that's cool and </v>

87
00:03:38.171 --> 00:03:39.460
<v Speaker 1>popular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number six,</v>

88
00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.060
<v Speaker 1>not using the subjunctive mood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Subjunctive mood as a form of the verb.</v>

89
00:03:43.061 --> 00:03:43.894
<v Speaker 1>That's used for something not factual </v>
<v Speaker 1>like possibility or desire or a </v>

90
00:03:46.661 --> 00:03:49.900
<v Speaker 1>necessity in English.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The subjunctive has a unique form in the</v>

91
00:03:49.901 --> 00:03:50.734
<v Speaker 1>third person present tense and the verb </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be has a unique forum in the third </v>

92
00:03:53.591 --> 00:03:54.520
<v Speaker 1>person past tense.</v>

93
00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.180
<v Speaker 1>Some people just don't use it at all or </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're confused about when to use it.</v>

94
00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.073
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's important that he goes to the </v>

95
00:04:00.401 --> 00:04:03.280
<v Speaker 1>hospital that's actually wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The correct sentence would be,</v>

96
00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.170
<v Speaker 1>it's important that he go to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hospital.</v>

97
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.660
<v Speaker 1>We need the subjunctive mood here to </v>
<v Speaker 1>show necessity.</v>

98
00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.910
<v Speaker 1>Another example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I was rich,</v>

99
00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:12.550
<v Speaker 1>the correct version would be if I were </v>
<v Speaker 1>rich here,</v>

100
00:04:12.551 --> 00:04:14.950
<v Speaker 1>we need the subjunctive because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>showing possibility.</v>

101
00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.873
<v Speaker 1>Number five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>confusion of is and our this confusion </v>

102
00:04:18.071 --> 00:04:21.700
<v Speaker 1>usually happens with there is and there </v>
<v Speaker 1>are or here is and here are.</v>

103
00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.710
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's three cookies for you.</v>

104
00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.440
<v Speaker 1>The correct sentence would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here are three cookies for you.</v>

105
00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:27.573
<v Speaker 1>Another example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's around seven people at the </v>

106
00:04:29.081 --> 00:04:29.914
<v Speaker 1>party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The correct sentence would be there are </v>

107
00:04:31.211 --> 00:04:33.670
<v Speaker 1>around seven people at the party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so many people,</v>

108
00:04:33.671 --> 00:04:34.504
<v Speaker 1>even educated speakers use both of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>forms so much that I'm not even sure </v>

109
00:04:37.271 --> 00:04:38.830
<v Speaker 1>that they're considered mistakes </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

110
00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.740
<v Speaker 1>Number for confusion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the verbs lie and lay.</v>

111
00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:42.783
<v Speaker 1>Most native English speakers know that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a difference between these </v>

112
00:04:44.651 --> 00:04:45.484
<v Speaker 1>words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're kind of confused about what </v>

113
00:04:46.511 --> 00:04:48.640
<v Speaker 1>the difference is or they know what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference is,</v>

114
00:04:48.641 --> 00:04:51.910
<v Speaker 1>but they use them indirectly anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lie as an intransitive verb,</v>

115
00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.490
<v Speaker 1>meaning it takes no direct object.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

116
00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.800
<v Speaker 1>let's lie on the bed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh boy.</v>

117
00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.890
<v Speaker 1>I can imagine the comments already lay </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a transitive verb,</v>

118
00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.440
<v Speaker 1>meaning it takes a direct object.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

119
00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.410
<v Speaker 1>let's lay the laundry on the bed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but lots of people say,</v>

120
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.273
<v Speaker 1>let's lay on the bed and that's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People also mistake the past tense form </v>

121
00:05:10.231 --> 00:05:11.064
<v Speaker 1>and the past participle of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I often hear people say live like he </v>

122
00:05:14.501 --> 00:05:18.010
<v Speaker 1>lied on the floor or laid like he laid </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the floor,</v>

123
00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.980
<v Speaker 1>but really the past tense of lie is lay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the past.</v>

124
00:05:20.981 --> 00:05:22.170
<v Speaker 1>Participle is glade.</v>

125
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.690
<v Speaker 1>The past tense of les is late in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>past participle.</v>

126
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.060
<v Speaker 1>There's also laid number three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>confusion of the words,</v>

127
00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.420
<v Speaker 1>fewer and less,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fewer as used for countdowns and less is</v>

128
00:05:31.421 --> 00:05:34.780
<v Speaker 1>used for non count mountains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people often use less for nouns.</v>

129
00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.540
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I eat less cookies than I used to.</v>

130
00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:38.553
<v Speaker 1>Cookies are accountable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the correct sentence is I eat fewer </v>

131
00:05:40.601 --> 00:05:41.470
<v Speaker 1>cookies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I used to.</v>

132
00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.470
<v Speaker 1>That kind of mistake is very widespread </v>
<v Speaker 1>number too confusing.</v>

133
00:05:44.471 --> 00:05:47.770
<v Speaker 1>The past tense form and the past </v>
<v Speaker 1>participle form of irregular verbs.</v>

134
00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:48.723
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the group to go has the past tense form </v>

135
00:05:50.291 --> 00:05:53.890
<v Speaker 1>went in the past participle gone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but lots of people say things like,</v>

136
00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:54.963
<v Speaker 1>I should have went to the party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the correct sentence is I should've </v>

137
00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.210
<v Speaker 1>gone to the party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another example,</v>

138
00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:02.510
<v Speaker 1>the verb to drink the past tense form is</v>
<v Speaker 1>drank in the past.</v>

139
00:06:02.511 --> 00:06:03.740
<v Speaker 1>Participle is drunk.</v>

140
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:04.663
<v Speaker 1>Some people say things like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's already drank two beers and it's </v>

141
00:06:06.621 --> 00:06:07.520
<v Speaker 1>only 4:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>PM,</v>

142
00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:09.620
<v Speaker 1>but it should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's already drunk.</v>

143
00:06:09.621 --> 00:06:11.780
<v Speaker 1>Two Beers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>number one,</v>

144
00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.610
<v Speaker 1>misuse of the word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Literally.</v>

145
00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:14.683
<v Speaker 1>The real original meaning of this word </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that something in reality is exactly </v>

146
00:06:17.481 --> 00:06:20.090
<v Speaker 1>as spoken without metaphor or </v>
<v Speaker 1>exaggeration.</v>

147
00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:20.983
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you say she literally has thousands </v>

148
00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:25.220
<v Speaker 1>of pairs of shoes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that means if you count all of her pairs</v>

149
00:06:25.221 --> 00:06:26.780
<v Speaker 1>of shoes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there will be thousands of them.</v>

150
00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:28.100
<v Speaker 1>Not Hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not dozens,</v>

151
00:06:28.101 --> 00:06:31.040
<v Speaker 1>but really thousands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but these days people often use the word</v>

152
00:06:31.041 --> 00:06:34.370
<v Speaker 1>literally just to put emphasis on </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's not actually literally,</v>

153
00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.860
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy has literally a monster.</v>

154
00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:37.520
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>

155
00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.290
<v Speaker 1>That sentence means that he looks like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

156
00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:41.360
<v Speaker 1>He's not a human.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a real monster,</v>

157
00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:44.090
<v Speaker 1>but that's not what they meant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just meant that he's a bad person.</v>

158
00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.580
<v Speaker 1>This kind of mistake literally makes me </v>
<v Speaker 1>scream,</v>

159
00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:50.120
<v Speaker 1>what are you waiting for me to scream?</v>

160
00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:52.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't actually scream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't mean that.</v>

161
00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.353
<v Speaker 1>Literally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that basically all native </v>

162
00:06:56.121 --> 00:06:58.520
<v Speaker 1>speakers make some mistakes in writing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and in speaking,</v>

163
00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:00.830
<v Speaker 1>if we judge by strict grammatical </v>
<v Speaker 1>standards,</v>

164
00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:01.693
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it's because they're just </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking on their feet and maybe their </v>

165
00:07:03.591 --> 00:07:04.424
<v Speaker 1>ideas aren't completely organized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so things come out a little bit unclear </v>

166
00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:09.140
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes it might be a habitual </v>
<v Speaker 1>mistake.</v>

167
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:10.970
<v Speaker 1>They repeat the same mistake over and </v>
<v Speaker 1>over,</v>

168
00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:11.953
<v Speaker 1>but the issue is not black and white.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously standard languages need rules </v>

169
00:07:14.961 --> 00:07:15.794
<v Speaker 1>so that there's not total chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time languages are </v>

170
00:07:18.141 --> 00:07:18.974
<v Speaker 1>always evolving and sometimes a mistake </v>
<v Speaker 1>may be a new innovation in the language </v>

171
00:07:22.371 --> 00:07:25.580
<v Speaker 1>that just doesn't match the rules of </v>
<v Speaker 1>grammar yet because the rules of grammar</v>

172
00:07:25.581 --> 00:07:26.414
<v Speaker 1>would decided in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the question of the day for native </v>

173
00:07:28.401 --> 00:07:29.234
<v Speaker 1>English speakers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think of the kind of </v>

174
00:07:30.081 --> 00:07:31.820
<v Speaker 1>mistakes that I described in the video?</v>

175
00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:32.683
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that they're a danger to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the English language or do you see them </v>

176
00:07:34.641 --> 00:07:38.750
<v Speaker 1>as mere innovations or does it depend on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the case and the question of the day for</v>

177
00:07:38.751 --> 00:07:41.930
<v Speaker 1>native speakers of other languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you notice these kinds of mistakes in</v>

178
00:07:41.931 --> 00:07:44.120
<v Speaker 1>your own native language?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think of them?</v>

179
00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:46.600
