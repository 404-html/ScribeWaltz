00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:06.200
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you for tuning into the lane focus</v>

2
00:00:06.201 --> 00:00:07.490
<v Speaker 1>channel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My name is Paul.</v>

3
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.500
<v Speaker 1>Today's topic is the Fsi free courses </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are available online.</v>

4
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:13.633
<v Speaker 1>So what does the Fsi that is the foreign</v>
<v Speaker 1>service institute and that is where </v>

5
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:17.713
<v Speaker 1>American diplomats or foreign service </v>
<v Speaker 1>workers do their intensive language </v>

6
00:00:20.901 --> 00:00:21.734
<v Speaker 1>training before they are placed abroad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now why does that matter to us to </v>

7
00:00:25.191 --> 00:00:28.460
<v Speaker 1>language learners?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will it's because the Fsi materials,</v>

8
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:29.323
<v Speaker 1>at least the older Fsi and materials </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they use for their intensive </v>

9
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:33.373
<v Speaker 1>language study are available in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>public domain and you can get them on </v>

10
00:00:35.991 --> 00:00:39.560
<v Speaker 1>the Internet for free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's very relevant to us.</v>

11
00:00:39.561 --> 00:00:42.200
<v Speaker 1>Anything that's free makes us pay a </v>
<v Speaker 1>close attention,</v>

12
00:00:42.201 --> 00:00:43.400
<v Speaker 1>doesn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

13
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.250
<v Speaker 1>you can also get them in hard copy </v>
<v Speaker 1>format.</v>

14
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.250
<v Speaker 1>You can get some repackaged versions </v>
<v Speaker 1>like this.</v>

15
00:00:49.251 --> 00:00:50.084
<v Speaker 1>This one is called mastering Hebrew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is actually the Fsi Hebrew </v>

16
00:00:52.761 --> 00:00:53.090
<v Speaker 1>course.</v>

17
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.923
<v Speaker 1>Just some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

18
00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.930
<v Speaker 1>some entrepreneur repackage them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>decided to sell it.</v>

19
00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.490
<v Speaker 1>I also have this one mastering French </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I have this one which is called.</v>

20
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:02.663
<v Speaker 1>It's just Saudi Arabic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the Saudi Arabic of course from </v>

21
00:01:05.241 --> 00:01:06.074
<v Speaker 1>the FSF.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can buy them in hard copy format </v>

22
00:01:08.781 --> 00:01:09.614
<v Speaker 1>if you are willing to spend some money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want the free one or if you want </v>

23
00:01:11.601 --> 00:01:13.730
<v Speaker 1>to try them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they're public domain,</v>

24
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.833
<v Speaker 1>find them on the Internet and I'll give </v>
<v Speaker 1>you a link where you can find them </v>

25
00:01:17.271 --> 00:01:18.104
<v Speaker 1>later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's talk a little bit about the </v>

26
00:01:19.281 --> 00:01:22.340
<v Speaker 1>pros and cons of these FSI materials.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

27
00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.190
<v Speaker 1>the pros,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing is there are free.</v>

28
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.290
<v Speaker 1>So how can you go wrong with free </v>
<v Speaker 1>materials?</v>

29
00:01:27.291 --> 00:01:28.124
<v Speaker 1>Even if they suck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you stopped using them and you've </v>

30
00:01:30.111 --> 00:01:31.040
<v Speaker 1>lost nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

31
00:01:31.041 --> 00:01:33.020
<v Speaker 1>So you can download them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try them out,</v>

32
00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.770
<v Speaker 1>see how it goes.</v>

33
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.420
<v Speaker 1>They're free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What more could you ask for?</v>

34
00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.180
<v Speaker 1>The second thing is that they are quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>dense courses.</v>

35
00:01:38.181 --> 00:01:39.014
<v Speaker 1>There is quite a lot of material that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can use that you can get through </v>

36
00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.080
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Hebrew one is about 550 pages.</v>

37
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.153
<v Speaker 1>The French one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well this is only one quarter of it </v>

38
00:01:47.571 --> 00:01:51.020
<v Speaker 1>right here on this in this volume,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is 250 pages.</v>

39
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.913
<v Speaker 1>It's altogether,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's 900 or a thousand pages and the </v>

40
00:01:54.081 --> 00:01:54.914
<v Speaker 1>Arabic one is 250 pages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's quite a lot of material for </v>

41
00:01:57.891 --> 00:02:00.860
<v Speaker 1>you to use and there's hours and hours </v>
<v Speaker 1>of audio to go with it,</v>

42
00:02:00.861 --> 00:02:04.130
<v Speaker 1>so it's just a lot that you can use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you do work through that material,</v>

43
00:02:04.131 --> 00:02:04.964
<v Speaker 1>you'll gain a good working knowledge of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the language that will probably also be </v>

44
00:02:08.031 --> 00:02:08.864
<v Speaker 1>very good for your sentence level </v>
<v Speaker 1>fluency because they just drilled the </v>

45
00:02:11.241 --> 00:02:12.074
<v Speaker 1>hell out of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are so many drills in these </v>

46
00:02:13.251 --> 00:02:15.320
<v Speaker 1>courses and there are question and </v>
<v Speaker 1>answer drills,</v>

47
00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.480
<v Speaker 1>substitution drills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>transformation drills,</v>

48
00:02:17.481 --> 00:02:18.231
<v Speaker 1>just drills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drills,</v>

49
00:02:18.231 --> 00:02:18.800
<v Speaker 1>drills.</v>

50
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.633
<v Speaker 1>Not all the time but a lot of the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it really helps you just spit out </v>

51
00:02:23.601 --> 00:02:26.930
<v Speaker 1>the sentences more quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really helps improve your fluency and</v>

52
00:02:26.931 --> 00:02:27.764
<v Speaker 1>to produce sentences on the go when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to so you don't have to spend as </v>

53
00:02:30.921 --> 00:02:32.960
<v Speaker 1>much thinking time to produce your </v>
<v Speaker 1>sentences.</v>

54
00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.980
<v Speaker 1>After finishing the FSI Hebrew course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a huge jump in my fluency.</v>

55
00:02:36.981 --> 00:02:39.170
<v Speaker 1>I could produce sentences much more </v>
<v Speaker 1>rapidly.</v>

56
00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.520
<v Speaker 1>I actually studied with the Fsi course </v>
<v Speaker 1>between two trips to the Middle East.</v>

57
00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.240
<v Speaker 1>On the first trip I couldn't really </v>
<v Speaker 1>produce sentences very quickly and on my</v>

58
00:02:47.241 --> 00:02:49.820
<v Speaker 1>second trip there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after using the Fsi course,</v>

59
00:02:49.821 --> 00:02:50.900
<v Speaker 1>everybody told me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

60
00:02:50.901 --> 00:02:51.734
<v Speaker 1>you speak like a native speaker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess they're flattering me a little </v>

61
00:02:54.201 --> 00:02:55.034
<v Speaker 1>bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but basically doing so many drills </v>

62
00:02:56.421 --> 00:03:00.550
<v Speaker 1>helped me to to speak fluently and </v>
<v Speaker 1>without lot of pausing and hesitation.</v>

63
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:01.563
<v Speaker 1>They're also good because the language </v>
<v Speaker 1>presented is based on everyday common </v>

64
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:05.343
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>

65
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.510
<v Speaker 1>Things like meeting someone for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first time,</v>

66
00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.720
<v Speaker 1>ordering a ticket at the station,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inviting someone out,</v>

67
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.600
<v Speaker 1>that kind of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about the weather.</v>

68
00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.120
<v Speaker 1>Those are the way they introduce the </v>
<v Speaker 1>language at the beginning of the lessons</v>

69
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.750
<v Speaker 1>and then after that they expand upon </v>
<v Speaker 1>that by drilling the hell out of you,</v>

70
00:03:19.751 --> 00:03:20.584
<v Speaker 1>but they introduced the language using </v>
<v Speaker 1>those common situations so everything </v>

71
00:03:23.501 --> 00:03:24.334
<v Speaker 1>you learn is quite useful and relevant </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's thematically based in each </v>

72
00:03:27.251 --> 00:03:28.084
<v Speaker 1>chapter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that helps you remember all of the </v>

73
00:03:29.831 --> 00:03:33.100
<v Speaker 1>new material you're learning now for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>cons or the bad.</v>

74
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:34.593
<v Speaker 1>These courses are mind numbingly boring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least some of them and at least at </v>

75
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:38.793
<v Speaker 1>times they can be really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really drill intensive and I remember </v>

76
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.050
<v Speaker 1>sitting there in the middle of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>courses sometimes just counting down the</v>

77
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.501
<v Speaker 1>minutes saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

78
00:03:44.501 --> 00:03:45.910
<v Speaker 1>10 more minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 more minutes,</v>

79
00:03:45.911 --> 00:03:46.744
<v Speaker 1>I'm almost done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just praying for the end because </v>

80
00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.350
<v Speaker 1>they really are boring.</v>

81
00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.980
<v Speaker 1>You need to be motivated yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These courses will not motivate you.</v>

82
00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.023
<v Speaker 1>They're really dry a lot of the time and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just have to push through them and </v>

83
00:03:57.821 --> 00:04:00.460
<v Speaker 1>that requires you to bring your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation to the table.</v>

84
00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.660
<v Speaker 1>Another downside is that the audio </v>
<v Speaker 1>materials are just not that high quality</v>

85
00:04:04.661 --> 00:04:05.494
<v Speaker 1>because they were produced in the 19 </v>
<v Speaker 1>sixties and seventies quite a long time </v>

86
00:04:07.961 --> 00:04:12.790
<v Speaker 1>ago and the new cds that you might get </v>
<v Speaker 1>are still based on those original master</v>

87
00:04:12.791 --> 00:04:14.440
<v Speaker 1>tapes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So sometimes they're not clear,</v>

88
00:04:14.441 --> 00:04:16.840
<v Speaker 1>they're a bit fuzzy and they're just not</v>
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>

89
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:18.383
<v Speaker 1>They're not really as good of a model as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a digital audio recording would be a </v>

90
00:04:21.431 --> 00:04:22.264
<v Speaker 1>modern recording,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I would recommend that if you do use </v>

91
00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:28.270
<v Speaker 1>these Fsi materials,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get some other more modern digitally</v>

92
00:04:28.271 --> 00:04:29.104
<v Speaker 1>recorded audio materials so that you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>copy the pronunciation of a native </v>

93
00:04:32.381 --> 00:04:33.730
<v Speaker 1>speaker clearly.</v>

94
00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:34.563
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another downside is that these courses </v>

95
00:04:36.581 --> 00:04:39.430
<v Speaker 1>are not really made to be used as </v>
<v Speaker 1>standalone materials.</v>

96
00:04:39.431 --> 00:04:40.264
<v Speaker 1>They're made to be a manual for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>classroom course that is taught by an </v>

97
00:04:43.811 --> 00:04:44.644
<v Speaker 1>instructor and the instructor in these </v>
<v Speaker 1>courses is supposed to give you extra </v>

98
00:04:47.981 --> 00:04:48.814
<v Speaker 1>activities that help you get more </v>
<v Speaker 1>interactive experience and sometimes in </v>

99
00:04:51.881 --> 00:04:54.610
<v Speaker 1>some of the books you can see notes to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the instructor like,</v>

100
00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:55.503
<v Speaker 1>please do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please prepare an activity for this </v>

101
00:04:57.101 --> 00:04:57.934
<v Speaker 1>purpose and that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But obviously those activities are not </v>

102
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.833
<v Speaker 1>in the book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were up to the instructor of the </v>

103
00:05:03.071 --> 00:05:03.904
<v Speaker 1>classroom course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these books don't come with a </v>

104
00:05:05.651 --> 00:05:08.410
<v Speaker 1>classroom course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to get that experience,</v>

105
00:05:08.411 --> 00:05:12.220
<v Speaker 1>that extra component that the teacher </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be responsible for.</v>

106
00:05:12.221 --> 00:05:13.054
<v Speaker 1>You have to get done on your own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so really you need to just get </v>

107
00:05:15.341 --> 00:05:18.370
<v Speaker 1>experience communicating and interacting</v>
<v Speaker 1>with native speakers.</v>

108
00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:19.600
<v Speaker 1>You need to take some lessons.</v>

109
00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.910
<v Speaker 1>You get to talk with friends who speak </v>
<v Speaker 1>that language,</v>

110
00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:23.860
<v Speaker 1>just do that in addition to these </v>
<v Speaker 1>courses,</v>

111
00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:24.753
<v Speaker 1>so in conclusion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people find these Fsi courses </v>

112
00:05:27.041 --> 00:05:29.350
<v Speaker 1>really just too boring to drill </v>
<v Speaker 1>intensive,</v>

113
00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:30.243
<v Speaker 1>but I do marginally recommend them for </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are just having trouble with </v>

114
00:05:33.791 --> 00:05:36.040
<v Speaker 1>fluency and having trouble with sentence</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>

115
00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:37.023
<v Speaker 1>People who take a long time to think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about their sentences and piece them </v>

116
00:05:39.311 --> 00:05:41.830
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to gain that automaticity,</v>

117
00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:44.290
<v Speaker 1>that fluency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you want to just practice with some</v>

118
00:05:44.291 --> 00:05:46.150
<v Speaker 1>drills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are really good for drills.</v>

119
00:05:46.151 --> 00:05:46.984
<v Speaker 1>That's basically the main thing I </v>
<v Speaker 1>recommend them for and if you want to </v>

120
00:05:49.241 --> 00:05:52.720
<v Speaker 1>just be able to spit out sentences more </v>
<v Speaker 1>quickly than by all means try these out.</v>

121
00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:53.583
<v Speaker 1>Check out their drills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but bring your own motivation to the </v>

122
00:05:56.051 --> 00:06:01.051
<v Speaker 1>table because these are boring and also </v>
<v Speaker 1>just be prepared for some unclear audio.</v>

123
00:06:01.071 --> 00:06:05.960
<v Speaker 1>Don't expect 2015 level audio quality </v>
<v Speaker 1>for because you won't get it.</v>

124
00:06:05.961 --> 00:06:10.160
<v Speaker 1>So supplement with some other audio that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can model your pronunciation after.</v>

125
00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:12.740
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for tuning into the length </v>
<v Speaker 1>focus channel.</v>

126
00:06:12.741 --> 00:06:14.330
<v Speaker 1>Have a good night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talk to you later.</v>

127
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.170
<v Speaker 1>Something that has been all the rage </v>
<v Speaker 1>recently,</v>

128
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:19.123
<v Speaker 1>something called duo lingo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now this is a totally free language </v>

129
00:06:22.311 --> 00:06:26.000
<v Speaker 1>learning platform.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has a online desktop version and also</v>

130
00:06:26.001 --> 00:06:29.180
<v Speaker 1>a smartphone version.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's quite good.</v>

131
00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:31.460
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like it,</v>

132
00:06:31.461 --> 00:06:32.294
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's quite expensive and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems to be one of the common </v>

133
00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:36.560
<v Speaker 1>complaints is just the price.</v>
