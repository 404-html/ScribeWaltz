00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.190
<v Speaker 1>Hm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the topic of today's video?</v>

2
00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:05.050
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's far too general.</v>

3
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.210
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that either.</v>

4
00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.420
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I already made a video on that one.</v>

5
00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:12.910
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>

6
00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:15.423
<v Speaker 2>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and </v>

7
00:00:17.071 --> 00:00:17.904
<v Speaker 2>my name is Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Today I'm going to talk about the </v>

8
00:00:19.661 --> 00:00:22.480
<v Speaker 2>Russian language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is Russian important?</v>

9
00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:23.493
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Russia is one of the world's major </v>

10
00:00:25.091 --> 00:00:25.924
<v Speaker 2>languages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is one of the six official languages </v>

11
00:00:27.731 --> 00:00:28.564
<v Speaker 2>of the United Nations and it is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>eighth most widely spoken language in </v>

12
00:00:31.301 --> 00:00:32.134
<v Speaker 2>the world with around $155 million </v>
<v Speaker 2>native speakers and around 260 million </v>

13
00:00:36.371 --> 00:00:39.070
<v Speaker 2>speakers in total.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we include second language speakers.</v>

14
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.350
<v Speaker 2>It's an official language in Russia of </v>
<v Speaker 2>course,</v>

15
00:00:41.351 --> 00:00:43.570
<v Speaker 2>but also in Belo Reus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tajikistan,</v>

16
00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:44.493
<v Speaker 2>Kurgestan and Kazakhstan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is also an official language and 38 </v>

17
00:00:47.741 --> 00:00:48.574
<v Speaker 2>other unrecognized states,</v>
<v Speaker 2>autonomous territories and regions in </v>

18
00:00:51.491 --> 00:00:53.260
<v Speaker 2>Ukraine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Moldova and Georgia,</v>

19
00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.640
<v Speaker 2>and also a few localities in Romania and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Russian economic zone in Spitsbergen</v>

20
00:00:57.641 --> 00:00:58.474
<v Speaker 2>in Norway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is also widely spoken as a second </v>

21
00:01:00.671 --> 00:01:03.580
<v Speaker 2>language on a Lingua Franca,</v>
<v Speaker 2>throughout much of Central Asia,</v>

22
00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.620
<v Speaker 2>the Caucasus region,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in eastern Europe.</v>

23
00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.650
<v Speaker 2>Even in a lot of places where it is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>an official language,</v>

24
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:09.633
<v Speaker 2>that's why Russian is important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Russian is the most widely spoken </v>

25
00:01:12.161 --> 00:01:12.994
<v Speaker 2>language of the Slavic language family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have a look at my video on the Slavic </v>

26
00:01:15.731 --> 00:01:18.610
<v Speaker 2>language family here to learn more about</v>
<v Speaker 2>it in detail,</v>

27
00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:19.563
<v Speaker 2>but in brief the Slavic languages or a </v>
<v Speaker 2>branch of the Indo European language </v>

28
00:01:22.751 --> 00:01:24.820
<v Speaker 2>family and the beginning of the Slavic </v>
<v Speaker 2>language.</v>

29
00:01:24.821 --> 00:01:27.610
<v Speaker 2>Branch traces back to a language called </v>
<v Speaker 2>Slavek,</v>

30
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.300
<v Speaker 2>which existed around 500 ce.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Over the next few hundred years,</v>

31
00:01:31.301 --> 00:01:34.720
<v Speaker 2>Prodo slavek split into three varieties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>west Slavic,</v>

32
00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:35.583
<v Speaker 2>south Slavic and east Slavek,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which eventually diverged into branches </v>

33
00:01:38.831 --> 00:01:41.560
<v Speaker 2>of the Slavic language family containing</v>
<v Speaker 2>numerous languages.</v>

34
00:01:41.561 --> 00:01:45.610
<v Speaker 2>Each Russian is an East Slavic language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>along with Belorussian Ukrainian,</v>

35
00:01:45.611 --> 00:01:49.060
<v Speaker 2>and also routine at the time that these </v>
<v Speaker 2>three branches developed,</v>

36
00:01:49.061 --> 00:01:52.630
<v Speaker 2>there was a single slavic literary </v>
<v Speaker 2>language that all Slavs could understand</v>

37
00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:53.523
<v Speaker 2>that language was old church slavonic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Russian has written in the cyrillic </v>

38
00:01:57.701 --> 00:01:58.534
<v Speaker 2>script,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was created for the purpose of </v>

39
00:01:59.741 --> 00:02:02.620
<v Speaker 2>writing old church slavonic until the </v>
<v Speaker 2>14th century.</v>

40
00:02:02.621 --> 00:02:05.050
<v Speaker 2>The ancestors of modern day Russians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ukrainians,</v>

41
00:02:05.051 --> 00:02:07.590
<v Speaker 2>and Belarusians living in a state called</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kevin.</v>

42
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.433
<v Speaker 2>Russ spoke dialects of old East Slavic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The spoken language existed alongside </v>

43
00:02:12.881 --> 00:02:15.040
<v Speaker 2>the literary language of Old Church </v>
<v Speaker 2>Slavonic,</v>

44
00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.750
<v Speaker 2>a situation of glossier.</v>

45
00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.060
<v Speaker 2>There is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>however,</v>

46
00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.893
<v Speaker 2>some evidence that people used to write </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the spoken vernacular for some kinds </v>

47
00:02:22.571 --> 00:02:23.404
<v Speaker 2>of casual writing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Birchbark letters from the town of </v>

48
00:02:25.091 --> 00:02:25.924
<v Speaker 2>Nevada road in the 14th century are </v>
<v Speaker 2>written in the vernacular language and </v>

49
00:02:28.751 --> 00:02:31.480
<v Speaker 2>the concern topics of daily life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Old Church slavonic,</v>

50
00:02:31.481 --> 00:02:32.314
<v Speaker 2>however,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was the literary and religious </v>

51
00:02:33.371 --> 00:02:38.320
<v Speaker 2>language in the 13th century CE Kevin </v>
<v Speaker 2>risk was conquered by the Mongol Empire,</v>

52
00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.430
<v Speaker 2>which brought a lot of foreign Turkic </v>
<v Speaker 2>loan words into the East Slavic dialect,</v>

53
00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.370
<v Speaker 2>especially words related to political </v>
<v Speaker 2>and financial matters.</v>

54
00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:48.100
<v Speaker 2>After the end of Mongol rule,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the 14th century,</v>

55
00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.370
<v Speaker 2>the oldest Slavic area was split into </v>
<v Speaker 2>two separate states,</v>

56
00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:52.383
<v Speaker 2>the Grand Duchy of Moscow to the east </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania to the </v>

57
00:02:55.241 --> 00:02:57.870
<v Speaker 2>West in the general area of Ukraine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Belarus,</v>

58
00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:58.743
<v Speaker 2>and Lithuania.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The oldest Slavic dialects in those two </v>

59
00:03:00.851 --> 00:03:03.730
<v Speaker 2>states began to split and develop in </v>
<v Speaker 2>different directions.</v>

60
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:04.713
<v Speaker 2>In the West,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Ruthenian language emerged with </v>

61
00:03:05.921 --> 00:03:06.754
<v Speaker 2>heavy Polish influence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ruthenian dialects would later develop </v>

62
00:03:09.071 --> 00:03:11.910
<v Speaker 2>into Ukrainian and in in the east </v>
<v Speaker 2>Russia,</v>

63
00:03:11.911 --> 00:03:14.920
<v Speaker 2>and emerged with much more influence </v>
<v Speaker 2>from old church slavonic.</v>

64
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.300
<v Speaker 2>Modern Russian today resulted from a </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of tug of war between an old church</v>

65
00:03:19.301 --> 00:03:20.134
<v Speaker 2>slavonic on the one hand and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>vernacular spoken dialects on the other </v>

66
00:03:23.021 --> 00:03:24.070
<v Speaker 2>hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

67
00:03:24.071 --> 00:03:27.850
<v Speaker 2>in 1453 ce,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after the fall of the Byzantine Empire,</v>

68
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.833
<v Speaker 2>Byzantine and Bulgarian scholars began </v>
<v Speaker 2>moving to Moscow and they were upset </v>

69
00:03:32.171 --> 00:03:35.260
<v Speaker 2>that old church slavonic had become </v>
<v Speaker 2>corrupted or crucified,</v>

70
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.190
<v Speaker 2>and they tried to standardize the </v>
<v Speaker 2>language to remove these impurities.</v>

71
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.010
<v Speaker 2>So a unique Russian language had begun </v>
<v Speaker 2>to emerge,</v>

72
00:03:42.011 --> 00:03:45.370
<v Speaker 2>but scholars pulled the language back </v>
<v Speaker 2>towards old church slavonic.</v>

73
00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.110
<v Speaker 2>But then during the rule of Peter the </v>
<v Speaker 2>great from 1696 to 1725,</v>

74
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.410
<v Speaker 2>the written language was pulled in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>different direction away from old church</v>

75
00:03:53.411 --> 00:03:55.630
<v Speaker 2>slavonic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In order to increase literacy,</v>

76
00:03:55.631 --> 00:03:58.150
<v Speaker 2>he simplified the orthography of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>written language,</v>

77
00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.520
<v Speaker 2>eliminating some letters and some </v>
<v Speaker 2>diacritics.</v>

78
00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:01.563
<v Speaker 2>He also made great efforts to modernize </v>
<v Speaker 2>and westernize Russia and started to </v>

79
00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:05.253
<v Speaker 2>Orient Russia towards Europe and French </v>
<v Speaker 2>became the common language of the upper </v>

80
00:04:08.681 --> 00:04:09.640
<v Speaker 2>classes in Russia.</v>

81
00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:10.803
<v Speaker 2>As you might guess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this resulted in the adoption of some </v>

82
00:04:12.461 --> 00:04:16.180
<v Speaker 2>French loan words into Russian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He also oversaw the intentional adoption</v>

83
00:04:16.181 --> 00:04:20.290
<v Speaker 2>of specialized modern vocabulary from </v>
<v Speaker 2>various European languages like French,</v>

84
00:04:20.291 --> 00:04:21.190
<v Speaker 2>Dutch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and German.</v>

85
00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:22.173
<v Speaker 2>Peter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the great's reforms were some of the </v>

86
00:04:23.141 --> 00:04:25.990
<v Speaker 2>first steps in the development of modern</v>
<v Speaker 2>literary Russian,</v>

87
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.973
<v Speaker 2>the basis of standard Russian today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another influential person in the </v>

88
00:04:29.621 --> 00:04:34.621
<v Speaker 2>development of modern literary Russian </v>
<v Speaker 2>was Mikaila Luminoso in 1755.</v>

89
00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:35.523
<v Speaker 2>He wrote a grammar of the Russian </v>
<v Speaker 2>language which revolutionized the </v>

90
00:04:37.721 --> 00:04:38.554
<v Speaker 2>written language by combining old church</v>
<v Speaker 2>slavonic with the spoken language </v>

91
00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:42.273
<v Speaker 2>throughout the grammar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He refers to old church slavonic as the </v>

92
00:04:44.171 --> 00:04:45.004
<v Speaker 2>language of high style and he refers to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the spoken language as the language of </v>

93
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.090
<v Speaker 2>low style and he advocated a blended </v>
<v Speaker 2>middle style for most forms of writing.</v>

94
00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:53.103
<v Speaker 2>The high style was basically reserved </v>
<v Speaker 2>for religious texts and the low style </v>

95
00:04:55.631 --> 00:04:59.440
<v Speaker 2>was reserved for the most casual written</v>
<v Speaker 2>material in the following decades.</v>

96
00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.430
<v Speaker 2>Authors and poets developed a new middle</v>
<v Speaker 2>style that would form the core of modern</v>

97
00:05:03.431 --> 00:05:04.264
<v Speaker 2>standard Russian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The most influential was the poet </v>

98
00:05:06.221 --> 00:05:07.054
<v Speaker 2>Alexander Pushkin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was sometimes referred to as the </v>

99
00:05:08.891 --> 00:05:09.724
<v Speaker 2>father of the modern Russian language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He fully developed the idea of three </v>

100
00:05:13.091 --> 00:05:14.890
<v Speaker 2>different language registers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>high,</v>

101
00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.440
<v Speaker 2>middle and low,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making the spoken vernacular,</v>

102
00:05:17.441 --> 00:05:18.274
<v Speaker 2>a legitimate part of the language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He also greatly expanded the vocabulary </v>

103
00:05:21.311 --> 00:05:22.144
<v Speaker 2>of literary Russian by directly </v>
<v Speaker 2>translating phrases and idioms from </v>

104
00:05:24.911 --> 00:05:27.790
<v Speaker 2>other languages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He greatly influenced modern literary,</v>

105
00:05:27.791 --> 00:05:28.624
<v Speaker 2>Russian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and as a result of modern standard </v>

106
00:05:29.831 --> 00:05:30.664
<v Speaker 2>Russian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which formed during this time based on </v>

107
00:05:31.901 --> 00:05:32.890
<v Speaker 2>the literary language</v>

108
00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:35.453
<v Speaker 2>in the 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Russian underwent some small changes </v>

109
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.333
<v Speaker 2>mainly in orthography,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but by far the most important thing to </v>

110
00:05:40.561 --> 00:05:43.860
<v Speaker 2>happen to the language was the creation </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the Soviet empire,</v>

111
00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:46.320
<v Speaker 2>universal schooling and the mass media </v>
<v Speaker 2>spread,</v>

112
00:05:46.321 --> 00:05:49.650
<v Speaker 2>modern standard Russian and reduced </v>
<v Speaker 2>dialectal variation in Russian.</v>

113
00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:50.693
<v Speaker 2>It also spread the language over a vast </v>
<v Speaker 2>geographic area covering all the member </v>

114
00:05:53.821 --> 00:05:55.770
<v Speaker 2>states of the USSR.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Today,</v>

115
00:05:55.771 --> 00:05:56.604
<v Speaker 2>Russian is still widely spoken in all of</v>
<v Speaker 2>those areas and is a common lingua </v>

116
00:05:59.301 --> 00:06:00.134
<v Speaker 2>Franca between different ethnic groups </v>
<v Speaker 2>and between the citizens of different </v>

117
00:06:02.571 --> 00:06:03.404
<v Speaker 2>countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what does Russian like orthography </v>

118
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:06.433
<v Speaker 2>Russian is written in cyrillic script,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an alphabet consisting of 33 letters </v>

119
00:06:09.891 --> 00:06:11.900
<v Speaker 2>which were mostly developed from Greek </v>
<v Speaker 2>letters,</v>

120
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.060
<v Speaker 2>some of the same as letters of the Latin</v>
<v Speaker 2>alphabet,</v>

121
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:17.000
<v Speaker 2>but some of the sounds they represent </v>
<v Speaker 2>are different like this one</v>

122
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:19.063
<v Speaker 3>phonology.</v>

123
00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:20.333
<v Speaker 2>There are 21 consonants in Russian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but 15 of them can be pronounced in two </v>

124
00:06:23.251 --> 00:06:25.020
<v Speaker 2>different ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>either hard or soft,</v>

125
00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:28.320
<v Speaker 2>and you have to judge which sound to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make by looking at the letter that comes</v>

126
00:06:28.321 --> 00:06:31.050
<v Speaker 2>after the continent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The soft sound is palletized,</v>

127
00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.810
<v Speaker 2>meaning that part of your tongue reaches</v>
<v Speaker 2>the roof of your mouth.</v>

128
00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:37.020
<v Speaker 2>This makes the consonant kind of sound </v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's followed by a y sound.</v>

129
00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:38.100
<v Speaker 2>Here are some examples.</v>

130
00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:39.680
<v Speaker 3>Buck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>buck,</v>

131
00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:42.160
<v Speaker 3>buck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>buck model,</v>

132
00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:47.790
<v Speaker 3>mel pro suck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>suck vowels.</v>

133
00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:49.563
<v Speaker 2>There are six basic vowels in Russian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a lot of variation in the </v>

134
00:06:52.421 --> 00:06:53.254
<v Speaker 2>vowels depending on the surrounding </v>
<v Speaker 2>sounds and based on the stress pattern </v>

135
00:06:55.811 --> 00:06:56.644
<v Speaker 2>of the work that wills are often reduced</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they appear in an unstressed </v>

136
00:06:59.291 --> 00:07:00.124
<v Speaker 2>syllable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This can make it a challenge to </v>

137
00:07:01.091 --> 00:07:03.220
<v Speaker 2>pronounce words correctly based on their</v>
<v Speaker 2>spelling.</v>

138
00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.070
<v Speaker 2>Grammar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Russian is a fusional language,</v>

139
00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:06.933
<v Speaker 2>meaning that suffixes and prefixes are </v>
<v Speaker 2>added to root words to communicate </v>

140
00:07:10.091 --> 00:07:12.490
<v Speaker 2>grammatical meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's look at nouns first.</v>

141
00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:13.413
<v Speaker 2>There are six now in cases in Russian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning that both the singular and the </v>

142
00:07:16.091 --> 00:07:16.924
<v Speaker 2>plural form of unowned can't take six </v>
<v Speaker 2>different forms depending on their </v>

143
00:07:19.601 --> 00:07:20.434
<v Speaker 2>grammatical function in the sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's look at an example using the word </v>

144
00:07:23.261 --> 00:07:25.030
<v Speaker 2>for sister nominative case.</v>

145
00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.073
<v Speaker 3>Sister,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sister reads genitive case since </v>

146
00:07:30.551 --> 00:07:32.460
<v Speaker 3>three years now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>misses three.</v>

147
00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:36.290
<v Speaker 3>I know the sister's name,</v>
<v Speaker 3>date of case series three.</v>

148
00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:40.150
<v Speaker 3>Sister,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the brother gave the sister a ticket.</v>

149
00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:45.550
<v Speaker 3>Accusative case says through visits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>through the brother sees the sister.</v>

150
00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:50.710
<v Speaker 3>Instrumental case says Roy Roy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I live with the sister.</v>

151
00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:55.510
<v Speaker 3>Prepositional case says three masses on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the sister.</v>

152
00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:57.173
<v Speaker 2>On a side note,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting to notice the cognate </v>

153
00:07:58.771 --> 00:08:02.490
<v Speaker 2>vocabulary between Russian and English </v>
<v Speaker 2>and some other European languages.</v>

154
00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:07.140
<v Speaker 2>Just the his sister,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his brother mediate his ticket,</v>

155
00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:11.550
<v Speaker 2>and even the word foresee reminds me of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Italian word Vedanta,</v>

156
00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:14.760
<v Speaker 2>which means to see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here we see some clear indications of</v>

157
00:08:14.761 --> 00:08:17.190
<v Speaker 2>Russian being an Indo European language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

158
00:08:17.191 --> 00:08:20.160
<v Speaker 2>back to the noun cases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The case endings are different depending</v>

159
00:08:20.161 --> 00:08:20.994
<v Speaker 2>on the gender of the now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Russia nouns are grouped according to </v>

160
00:08:23.161 --> 00:08:24.330
<v Speaker 2>gender,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with masculine,</v>

161
00:08:24.331 --> 00:08:25.164
<v Speaker 2>feminine and Neuter Nouns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can normally tell the nouns gender </v>

162
00:08:27.391 --> 00:08:28.224
<v Speaker 2>based on its ending.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Feminine Nouns can take either of these </v>

163
00:08:30.181 --> 00:08:31.530
<v Speaker 2>endings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>neuter.</v>

164
00:08:31.531 --> 00:08:34.590
<v Speaker 2>Nouns can take either of these endings </v>
<v Speaker 2>and masculine nouns.</v>

165
00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:35.563
<v Speaker 2>The nouns ending in any other letter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The one tricky exception is that some </v>

166
00:08:38.371 --> 00:08:39.204
<v Speaker 2>nouns and in this letter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and these can be either masculine or </v>

167
00:08:41.761 --> 00:08:42.594
<v Speaker 2>feminine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you need to memorize the gender of </v>

168
00:08:43.891 --> 00:08:44.580
<v Speaker 2>those ones.</v>

169
00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:45.413
<v Speaker 2>Adjectives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>adjectives and Russian are quite </v>

170
00:08:47.341 --> 00:08:48.174
<v Speaker 2>complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are inflicted to agree with the </v>

171
00:08:49.741 --> 00:08:50.574
<v Speaker 2>Noun they modified in gender number and </v>
<v Speaker 2>in case that means that any particular </v>

172
00:08:54.211 --> 00:08:57.450
<v Speaker 2>adjective can 24 different forums like </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

173
00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:00.780
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's look at a couple of examples.</v>

174
00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:04.380
<v Speaker 2>This is the adjective meaning new in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>nominative case.</v>

175
00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:09.900
<v Speaker 2>No Hilton over here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a new car in the genitive case,</v>

176
00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:12.900
<v Speaker 2>Nova,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nova.</v>

177
00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:13.853
<v Speaker 2>After my Buddha,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the new car's color so we can see how </v>

178
00:09:16.381 --> 00:09:19.610
<v Speaker 2>the ending of the adjective changes to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make it agree with the noun,</v>

179
00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:20.753
<v Speaker 2>but it's worth noting that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>inflectional endings added to the </v>

180
00:09:22.741 --> 00:09:25.320
<v Speaker 2>adjective or different from those added </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the now,</v>

181
00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:29.040
<v Speaker 2>so you need to memorize a big set of </v>
<v Speaker 2>endings for nouns and when to use them,</v>

182
00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:29.903
<v Speaker 2>but you have to memorize a whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>different set of endings for adjectives </v>

183
00:09:32.251 --> 00:09:33.084
<v Speaker 2>and when to use those verbs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Russian language has three verb </v>

184
00:09:36.121 --> 00:09:37.020
<v Speaker 2>tenses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>past,</v>

185
00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:38.220
<v Speaker 2>present,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and future.</v>

186
00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:41.400
<v Speaker 2>That sounds straightforward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Russian verbs are also distinguished</v>

187
00:09:41.401 --> 00:09:44.850
<v Speaker 2>based on something called aspect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's the perfective aspect,</v>

188
00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.550
<v Speaker 2>which means that an action has been </v>
<v Speaker 2>completed once.</v>

189
00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:48.503
<v Speaker 2>Then there's the imperfection of aspect </v>
<v Speaker 2>which shows that the action is still in </v>

190
00:09:51.151 --> 00:09:52.500
<v Speaker 2>progress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>still ongoing,</v>

191
00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:54.780
<v Speaker 2>or that it's an action that will be </v>
<v Speaker 2>recurring,</v>

192
00:09:54.781 --> 00:09:57.180
<v Speaker 2>will be repeated many times in Russian </v>
<v Speaker 2>verbs.</v>

193
00:09:57.181 --> 00:09:58.014
<v Speaker 2>There are two different verb stems for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the imperfections and the perfect </v>

194
00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.610
<v Speaker 2>aspect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically like two different words.</v>

195
00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:05.860
<v Speaker 2>Let's look at an example for the verb </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning to write first.</v>

196
00:10:05.861 --> 00:10:09.850
<v Speaker 2>The perfective visa and the imperfection</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Pisa.</v>

197
00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:13.050
<v Speaker 2>Either of these stems can be conjugated </v>
<v Speaker 2>for past,</v>

198
00:10:13.051 --> 00:10:14.400
<v Speaker 2>present,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and future tenses.</v>

199
00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:18.120
<v Speaker 2>Let's look at an example of how aspect </v>
<v Speaker 2>changes the meaning of a sentence.</v>

200
00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:19.043
<v Speaker 2>This sentence uses the verb with </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfective verb stem and is in the </v>

201
00:10:21.601 --> 00:10:23.220
<v Speaker 2>future tense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yanna.</v>

202
00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:26.340
<v Speaker 2>Can you go this sentence means I will </v>
<v Speaker 2>write a book,</v>

203
00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:27.233
<v Speaker 2>but when we take the aspect into account</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the meaning is I will write one </v>

204
00:10:29.971 --> 00:10:32.430
<v Speaker 2>specific book and action that will be </v>
<v Speaker 2>completed.</v>

205
00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:33.533
<v Speaker 2>This next sentence uses the imperfection</v>
<v Speaker 2>verb stem and is also in the future </v>

206
00:10:36.211 --> 00:10:37.044
<v Speaker 2>tense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Besides the meaning of this one is more </v>

207
00:10:39.571 --> 00:10:42.090
<v Speaker 2>like I will be writing a book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

208
00:10:42.091 --> 00:10:42.924
<v Speaker 2>I will be in the process of writing a </v>
<v Speaker 2>book at a certain time in the future or </v>

209
00:10:46.021 --> 00:10:48.570
<v Speaker 2>if we use the plural form of book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the meaning changes.</v>

210
00:10:48.571 --> 00:10:51.270
<v Speaker 2>It means I will write two books Jambo </v>
<v Speaker 2>besides,</v>

211
00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:55.680
<v Speaker 2>and that means I will write numerous </v>
<v Speaker 2>books of recurring action.</v>

212
00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:56.693
<v Speaker 2>So in that case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the imperfection of aspect indicates a </v>

213
00:10:58.441 --> 00:10:59.274
<v Speaker 2>slightly different meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basic word order the most common word </v>

214
00:11:02.221 --> 00:11:05.160
<v Speaker 2>order in Russian as Svo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but because of the case system,</v>

215
00:11:05.161 --> 00:11:08.490
<v Speaker 2>the word order is much more flexible </v>
<v Speaker 2>than it is in English and English.</v>

216
00:11:08.491 --> 00:11:09.324
<v Speaker 2>We normally judge the function of a word</v>
<v Speaker 2>depending on where it is in the </v>

217
00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:14.250
<v Speaker 2>sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in Russian we have the case system.</v>

218
00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:17.490
<v Speaker 2>The case endings can tell us the </v>
<v Speaker 2>function of the word so you can move the</v>

219
00:11:17.491 --> 00:11:20.040
<v Speaker 2>words around and we still understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>what the subject is,</v>

220
00:11:20.041 --> 00:11:20.874
<v Speaker 2>what the object is and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a basic sentence might be of course </v>

221
00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:27.090
<v Speaker 2>gripped by Malama,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning the cat caught the most,</v>

222
00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:31.850
<v Speaker 2>but you could also have much by molecule</v>
<v Speaker 2>or by Mahler,</v>

223
00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:34.590
<v Speaker 2>Gorshkov and some other possible word </v>
<v Speaker 2>orders,</v>

224
00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:37.170
<v Speaker 2>so the basic word order is flexible like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

225
00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.033
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in some cases the context or the style </v>

226
00:11:39.841 --> 00:11:40.674
<v Speaker 2>that you are trying to communicate it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and will determine the word order </v>

227
00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:45.270
<v Speaker 2>articles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like most Slavic languages,</v>

228
00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:46.163
<v Speaker 2>Russian doesn't have any articles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have words like [inaudible] </v>

229
00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.970
<v Speaker 2>or the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have any Russian speaking friends</v>

230
00:11:50.971 --> 00:11:53.010
<v Speaker 2>who dropped the articles when they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>speaking English,</v>

231
00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:55.840
<v Speaker 2>that's probably the reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how hard is rushing to learn?</v>

232
00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:56.823
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>according to the American Foreign </v>

233
00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:00.520
<v Speaker 2>Service Institute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Russian is a category four language,</v>

234
00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:02.890
<v Speaker 2>the most difficult categories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>category five,</v>

235
00:12:02.891 --> 00:12:04.720
<v Speaker 2>and that includes Japanese,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mandarin,</v>

236
00:12:04.721 --> 00:12:07.510
<v Speaker 2>and Arabic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Russian is in category four.</v>

237
00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:10.330
<v Speaker 2>That means that it's relatively </v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult for English speakers,</v>

238
00:12:10.331 --> 00:12:11.164
<v Speaker 2>but not the most difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The most challenging things will likely </v>

239
00:12:13.421 --> 00:12:14.254
<v Speaker 2>be the inflection of nouns and </v>
<v Speaker 2>adjectives as well as the system of </v>

240
00:12:16.721 --> 00:12:17.554
<v Speaker 2>verbal aspect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people mistakenly assume that the </v>

241
00:12:19.901 --> 00:12:20.734
<v Speaker 2>cyrillic alphabet is going to be the </v>
<v Speaker 2>most challenging part of learning </v>

242
00:12:22.841 --> 00:12:23.674
<v Speaker 2>Russian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people actually learn that fairly </v>

243
00:12:25.151 --> 00:12:28.060
<v Speaker 2>quickly once they start rushing as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>major global language.</v>

244
00:12:28.061 --> 00:12:28.894
<v Speaker 2>That will be very useful to you if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>spend any time in Russia or in any of </v>

245
00:12:31.511 --> 00:12:34.720
<v Speaker 2>the former Soviet republics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So your efforts will be well rewarded.</v>

246
00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:38.050
<v Speaker 2>So the question of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for people who have studied Russian,</v>

247
00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:38.913
<v Speaker 2>what did you find challenging about </v>
<v Speaker 2>Russia and what did you find </v>

248
00:12:40.751 --> 00:12:43.590
<v Speaker 2>straightforward about Russian and for </v>
<v Speaker 2>native speakers of Russia?</v>

249
00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:44.493
<v Speaker 2>Russia is a huge country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you notice a lot of variation in the </v>

250
00:12:46.751 --> 00:12:49.270
<v Speaker 2>way that Russia has spoken in different </v>
<v Speaker 2>parts of the countries?</v>

251
00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:51.880
<v Speaker 2>Are there noticeable accents or dialects</v>
<v Speaker 2>these days?</v>
