00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:05.303
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and </v>

3
00:00:07.171 --> 00:00:08.004
<v Speaker 1>my name is PLA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today I want to look at a linguistic </v>

4
00:00:10.591 --> 00:00:14.070
<v Speaker 1>phenomenon that I find interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called metathesis.</v>

5
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.083
<v Speaker 1>The word metathesis comes from the Greek</v>
<v Speaker 1>word may talk disease meaning change of </v>

6
00:00:18.721 --> 00:00:19.554
<v Speaker 1>position or transposition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It refers to a situation in which </v>

7
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.260
<v Speaker 1>adjacent sounds change position in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>word.</v>

8
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.273
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in English we have ask but you might </v>

9
00:00:28.351 --> 00:00:32.790
<v Speaker 1>have also heard acts in some dialects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see that the two consonants have</v>

10
00:00:32.791 --> 00:00:35.370
<v Speaker 1>switched places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another example from English,</v>

11
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:40.040
<v Speaker 1>we have the word asterisk which refers </v>
<v Speaker 1>to this little star looking symbol away,</v>

12
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.430
<v Speaker 1>not that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This one.</v>

13
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.730
<v Speaker 1>Some people pronounce it as Asterix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another one,</v>

14
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:50.150
<v Speaker 1>the prefix intro or intra is often </v>
<v Speaker 1>pronounced like inter for example,</v>

15
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.083
<v Speaker 1>introduce is sometimes pronounced </v>
<v Speaker 1>introduce so you can see that the r </v>

16
00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:57.060
<v Speaker 1>sound and the vowel have become </v>
<v Speaker 1>reversed.</v>

17
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.133
<v Speaker 1>Another one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the prefix pre or pro is often </v>

18
00:01:00.571 --> 00:01:05.250
<v Speaker 1>pronounced like per for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>prescription becomes prescription.</v>

19
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.833
<v Speaker 1>We can see examples of metathesis of </v>
<v Speaker 1>side-by-sides sound switching positions </v>

20
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.270
<v Speaker 1>in many different languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In.</v>

21
00:01:12.271 --> 00:01:14.100
<v Speaker 1>What kinds of situations does this </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen?</v>

22
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.350
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>during the development of a language,</v>

23
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.570
<v Speaker 1>there's sometimes a change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

24
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.190
<v Speaker 1>the English word bird came from.</v>
