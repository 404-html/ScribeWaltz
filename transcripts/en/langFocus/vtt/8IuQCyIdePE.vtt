00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:07.743
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4
00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:09.183
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and </v>

5
00:00:11.141 --> 00:00:14.890
<v Speaker 1>my name is Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today's topic is Haitian Creole,</v>

6
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.250
<v Speaker 1>the most widely spoken creole language </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world.</v>

7
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.800
<v Speaker 1>Haitian creole is the main language of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Haiti,</v>

8
00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:21.693
<v Speaker 1>mainly in the Western one third of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>island of Hispaniola with the rest of </v>

9
00:00:24.971 --> 00:00:27.370
<v Speaker 1>the island belonging to the Dominican </v>
<v Speaker 1>Republic.</v>

10
00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.540
<v Speaker 1>It's spoken by somewhere around 12 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million people including the 10.6</v>

11
00:00:31.541 --> 00:00:32.374
<v Speaker 1>million people of Haiti and Haitian </v>
<v Speaker 1>immigrants living in the United States </v>

12
00:00:35.621 --> 00:00:36.880
<v Speaker 1>and Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>France,</v>

13
00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.863
<v Speaker 1>and various Caribbean countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Haitian creole is a young language that </v>

14
00:00:40.991 --> 00:00:43.510
<v Speaker 1>developed in the 17th and 18th </v>
<v Speaker 1>centuries.</v>

15
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:44.553
<v Speaker 1>It's a French based creole language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning that the vast majority of its </v>

16
00:00:47.711 --> 00:00:51.040
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>around 90% of it comes from French,</v>

17
00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.310
<v Speaker 1>but it's grammar is mainly rooted in </v>
<v Speaker 1>west African languages.</v>

18
00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:55.203
<v Speaker 1>It's sentence structure is said to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>very similar to the phone language of </v>

19
00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:58.813
<v Speaker 1>Benito.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did this combination of elements </v>

20
00:01:01.391 --> 00:01:04.810
<v Speaker 1>take place?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well a French colony and part of what is</v>

21
00:01:04.811 --> 00:01:05.590
<v Speaker 1>now Haiti.</v>

22
00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.970
<v Speaker 1>The island of Tortuga was founded in </v>
<v Speaker 1>1660 and a few years later,</v>

23
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.960
<v Speaker 1>the French west India company took </v>
<v Speaker 1>control of the colony and France claimed</v>

24
00:01:13.961 --> 00:01:18.580
<v Speaker 1>authority over the western part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hispaniola in 1697 Spain,</v>

25
00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.600
<v Speaker 1>which had previously controlled the </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire island seated the western portion</v>

26
00:01:22.601 --> 00:01:23.434
<v Speaker 1>of the island to France in exchange for </v>
<v Speaker 1>French promises to suppress acts of </v>

27
00:01:26.771 --> 00:01:29.170
<v Speaker 1>piracy against Spanish ships and </v>
<v Speaker 1>talents.</v>

28
00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.780
<v Speaker 1>The pirates were a lawless community of </v>
<v Speaker 1>French,</v>

29
00:01:31.781 --> 00:01:34.090
<v Speaker 1>Dutch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Englishman called the buccaneers.</v>

30
00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:34.983
<v Speaker 1>They attacked Spanish ships and talents </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the support of rival European </v>

31
00:01:37.931 --> 00:01:38.764
<v Speaker 1>powers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These people with a real pirates of the </v>

32
00:01:40.541 --> 00:01:42.350
<v Speaker 1>Caribbean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I digress.</v>

33
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.380
<v Speaker 1>In the French colony,</v>
<v Speaker 1>settlers founded tobacco,</v>

34
00:01:45.381 --> 00:01:49.310
<v Speaker 1>cotton and cocoa farms and African </v>
<v Speaker 1>slaves were imported to work them.</v>

35
00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:50.323
<v Speaker 1>Almost all of Haiti's present day </v>
<v Speaker 1>population descended it from such </v>

36
00:01:52.911 --> 00:01:53.744
<v Speaker 1>slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The French colonialists spoke various </v>

37
00:01:56.061 --> 00:01:56.894
<v Speaker 1>nonstandard dialects of French.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While the slave spoke various west </v>

38
00:01:59.871 --> 00:02:00.830
<v Speaker 1>African languages.</v>

39
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.190
<v Speaker 1>It's thought that the gay languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a branch of the Nigeria,</v>

40
00:02:04.191 --> 00:02:05.024
<v Speaker 1>Congo language family were spoken by a </v>
<v Speaker 1>large proportion of the slaves with </v>

41
00:02:08.151 --> 00:02:08.984
<v Speaker 1>slaves very often unable to communicate </v>
<v Speaker 1>with each other or with their slave </v>

42
00:02:11.931 --> 00:02:13.820
<v Speaker 1>masters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They tried to learn French,</v>

43
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.310
<v Speaker 1>but without formal training or </v>
<v Speaker 1>education,</v>

44
00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.830
<v Speaker 1>they developed a French based pigeon </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

45
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.450
<v Speaker 1>A pigeon language is a simplified form </v>
<v Speaker 1>of communication that arises when people</v>

46
00:02:23.451 --> 00:02:24.284
<v Speaker 1>with no common language attempt to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Communicate Pidgin languages have no </v>

47
00:02:27.321 --> 00:02:28.154
<v Speaker 1>native speakers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When a pidgin language begins to be </v>

48
00:02:29.931 --> 00:02:33.110
<v Speaker 1>spoken as a native language by people </v>
<v Speaker 1>born in that environment,</v>

49
00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.973
<v Speaker 1>it becomes a creole language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas pigeons are simplified forms of </v>

50
00:02:37.431 --> 00:02:39.770
<v Speaker 1>communication and may be limited in </v>
<v Speaker 1>function.</v>

51
00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:40.723
<v Speaker 1>When they become creole languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they increase in complexity and can be </v>

52
00:02:43.491 --> 00:02:44.324
<v Speaker 1>used for all functions of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Haitian creole is a fully functional </v>

53
00:02:47.241 --> 00:02:48.074
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to learn more about pigeons </v>

54
00:02:50.451 --> 00:02:51.284
<v Speaker 1>and creoles and how they develop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>check out my video on the subject right </v>

55
00:02:53.991 --> 00:02:54.824
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

56
00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.920
<v Speaker 1>There are also other influences on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Haitian creole,</v>

57
00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:58.783
<v Speaker 1>aside from French and African languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Contact with other Europeans brought </v>

58
00:03:02.771 --> 00:03:03.604
<v Speaker 1>some Spanish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese and English words into the </v>

59
00:03:05.381 --> 00:03:06.214
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were also frequent slave revolts </v>

60
00:03:08.261 --> 00:03:12.400
<v Speaker 1>and slaves escaping into the mountains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>encountered the native title people.</v>

61
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.750
<v Speaker 1>This contact introduced some Thai,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no words into Haitian creole.</v>

62
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.640
<v Speaker 1>Haiti gained independence from France in</v>
<v Speaker 1>1804 but French remains for the prestige</v>

63
00:03:21.641 --> 00:03:22.474
<v Speaker 1>language for the next 200 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The government conducted business and </v>

64
00:03:25.421 --> 00:03:26.254
<v Speaker 1>French and French was officially the </v>
<v Speaker 1>only language of education until fairly </v>

65
00:03:30.401 --> 00:03:31.234
<v Speaker 1>recently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Haitian creole was considered a </v>

66
00:03:32.621 --> 00:03:35.560
<v Speaker 1>corrupted form of French language of low</v>
<v Speaker 1>prestige,</v>

67
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:36.453
<v Speaker 1>the language of the poor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that stigma didn't stop patient </v>

68
00:03:38.711 --> 00:03:40.870
<v Speaker 1>creole from developing as a living </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

69
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.913
<v Speaker 1>At the end of the 18 hundreds literature</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Haitian creole was already being </v>

70
00:03:45.311 --> 00:03:48.400
<v Speaker 1>written even though there was no </v>
<v Speaker 1>standard way of writing the words.</v>

71
00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:52.900
<v Speaker 1>In the 1940s the president of Haiti made</v>
<v Speaker 1>an attempt to standardize Haitian creole</v>

72
00:03:52.901 --> 00:03:55.540
<v Speaker 1>orthography with the kind of phonetic </v>
<v Speaker 1>spelling system,</v>

73
00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:56.403
<v Speaker 1>but this met with a lot of resistance </v>
<v Speaker 1>because some people support it or </v>

74
00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:59.410
<v Speaker 1>orthography.</v>

75
00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.600
<v Speaker 1>That was more based on the way French's </v>
<v Speaker 1>written.</v>

76
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:03.453
<v Speaker 1>In 1979 patient creole was finally </v>
<v Speaker 1>standardized using a compromise between </v>

77
00:04:07.661 --> 00:04:10.930
<v Speaker 1>those two approaches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Haitian creole finally became a national</v>

78
00:04:10.931 --> 00:04:11.764
<v Speaker 1>language alongside French.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In 1987 before that school instruction </v>

79
00:04:15.641 --> 00:04:16.474
<v Speaker 1>had always been in French,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was basically a foreign language </v>

80
00:04:18.971 --> 00:04:19.804
<v Speaker 1>for most of the students.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When Haitian creole became a national </v>

81
00:04:22.061 --> 00:04:22.894
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was allowed to be used as a tool of </v>

82
00:04:24.641 --> 00:04:25.474
<v Speaker 1>education in schools alongside French,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was still officially at the </v>

83
00:04:28.451 --> 00:04:29.284
<v Speaker 1>language of instruction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess this change allowed schools to </v>

84
00:04:31.751 --> 00:04:33.910
<v Speaker 1>switch between French and Haitian </v>
<v Speaker 1>creole.</v>

85
00:04:33.911 --> 00:04:34.744
<v Speaker 1>Whenever that made instruction easier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>French used to be the language of </v>

86
00:04:38.681 --> 00:04:39.514
<v Speaker 1>official radio and TV broadcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the years since Haitian creole </v>

87
00:04:42.731 --> 00:04:45.490
<v Speaker 1>became a national language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both languages are used.</v>

88
00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:46.683
<v Speaker 1>The major newspapers are all in French,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it seems that nobody really reads </v>

89
00:04:49.841 --> 00:04:51.850
<v Speaker 1>them except people from the upper class.</v>

90
00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:53.163
<v Speaker 1>In Haiti,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there seem to be two main linguistic </v>

91
00:04:54.611 --> 00:04:55.444
<v Speaker 1>communities to bilingual upper classes </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the masses who mostly speak only </v>

92
00:04:59.051 --> 00:04:59.884
<v Speaker 1>Haitian creole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll maybe they understand some </v>

93
00:05:01.241 --> 00:05:02.950
<v Speaker 1>French as well because of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>schooling.</v>

94
00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.350
<v Speaker 1>So what does Haitian creole like as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>French based creole?</v>

95
00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.740
<v Speaker 1>It's connection to French is immediately</v>
<v Speaker 1>obvious.</v>

96
00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:10.780
<v Speaker 1>When you look at a Haitian creole </v>
<v Speaker 1>sentence.</v>

97
00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:11.643
<v Speaker 1>Most of the words are a French origin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're spelled quite differently </v>

98
00:05:14.351 --> 00:05:15.184
<v Speaker 1>than they are in French.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The French word of it is our vet in </v>

99
00:05:18.551 --> 00:05:23.551
<v Speaker 1>Haitian creole don't say is Dusey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mogi is my ga.</v>

100
00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:30.070
<v Speaker 1>A state is ash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mitzi is messy.</v>

101
00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:32.003
<v Speaker 1>Bull Swab year is Boswami c so you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>see that Haitian creole use a simpler </v>

102
00:05:36.791 --> 00:05:38.980
<v Speaker 1>largely phonetic spelling of French </v>
<v Speaker 1>words.</v>

103
00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:44.050
<v Speaker 1>You should clarify meaning I work is </v>
<v Speaker 1>went through Advi.</v>

104
00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:45.513
<v Speaker 1>The subject Pronoun here is interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the Haitian creole word for eye </v>

105
00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:49.893
<v Speaker 1>comes from the French disjunctive </v>
<v Speaker 1>pronoun more rather than just the </v>

106
00:05:53.261 --> 00:05:54.130
<v Speaker 1>subject pronouns.</v>

107
00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:55.203
<v Speaker 1>In Haitian creole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is no distinction between the </v>

108
00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:00.320
<v Speaker 1>object and disjunctive pronouns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just when,</v>

109
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:02.810
<v Speaker 1>except for a short form we'll see a bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>later.</v>

110
00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:04.603
<v Speaker 1>Here's another example of how French </v>
<v Speaker 1>words are often used differently in </v>

111
00:06:07.221 --> 00:06:08.054
<v Speaker 1>Haitian creole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means I know how to cook word for </v>

112
00:06:11.841 --> 00:06:12.674
<v Speaker 1>word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's I know make food when comes from </v>

113
00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.550
<v Speaker 1>Wa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Colin comes from net,</v>

114
00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:23.300
<v Speaker 1>comes from fair and mulching comes from </v>
<v Speaker 1>French.</v>

115
00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.150
<v Speaker 1>Mosaic in friendship would be very </v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

116
00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.880
<v Speaker 1>You just say queasy name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

117
00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:33.050
<v Speaker 1>in French there are two verbs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning to know Clinica and seth.</v>

118
00:06:33.051 --> 00:06:33.884

<v Speaker 1>being acquainted with someone or </v>

119
00:06:37.641 --> 00:06:38.474
<v Speaker 1>something while Steph Safwat is used </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you know how to do something or </v>

120
00:06:42.171 --> 00:06:44.780
<v Speaker 1>know something by heart in the French </v>
<v Speaker 1>sentence,</v>

121
00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:48.140
<v Speaker 1>savoir is used,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the Haitian creole sentence,</v>

122
00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:51.560
<v Speaker 1>the word column deriving from </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] is used.</v>

123
00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:57.080
<v Speaker 1>My Ga means to eat in Haitian creole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also means food.</v>

124
00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:01.340
<v Speaker 1>Samarin g means to make food or cook in </v>
<v Speaker 1>French,</v>

125
00:07:01.341 --> 00:07:06.341
<v Speaker 1>you could say shaft in the Nicu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means to make food with new Leq,</v>

126
00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.950
<v Speaker 1>meaning food mosaic doesn't mean food </v>
<v Speaker 1>and French.</v>

127
00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:11.083
<v Speaker 1>These kinds of changes in meaning or </v>
<v Speaker 1>usage of French words are common in </v>

128
00:07:13.761 --> 00:07:17.360
<v Speaker 1>Haitian creole personal pronouns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before we saw the pronouns,</v>

129
00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:18.793
<v Speaker 1>which means I or me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other personal pronouns are </v>

130
00:07:21.171 --> 00:07:22.004
<v Speaker 1>similarly of French origin but are a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little different from their French </v>

131
00:07:24.561 --> 00:07:25.720
<v Speaker 1>equivalents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

132
00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:27.983
<v Speaker 1>Noo Noo you'll notice that no is used </v>
<v Speaker 1>for we but also for you in the plural </v>

133
00:07:35.601 --> 00:07:37.700
<v Speaker 1>form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is distinct from French,</v>

134
00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:40.820
<v Speaker 1>which uses [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not New yogurt means they,</v>

135
00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:43.340
<v Speaker 1>and this one may not look like a French </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pronoun,</v>

136
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:45.800
<v Speaker 1>but it comes from the French disjunctive</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pronoun.</v>

137
00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:47.533
<v Speaker 1>All of these pronouns stayed the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether they are used as subject </v>

138
00:07:49.761 --> 00:07:52.760
<v Speaker 1>pronouns or object pronouns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When their menu,</v>

139
00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:55.850
<v Speaker 1>this means I liked them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll learn memory.</v>

140
00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:57.103
<v Speaker 1>This means they liked me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are however short forms of the </v>

141
00:08:00.351 --> 00:08:02.720
<v Speaker 1>pronouns which are used in certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>situations,</v>

142
00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:04.963
<v Speaker 1>possession to show possession.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You simply place the personal pronoun </v>

143
00:08:08.451 --> 00:08:12.770
<v Speaker 1>after the now leavell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means your book with the first word</v>

144
00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:17.210
<v Speaker 1>leave meaning book and Ou is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>personal pronoun for you in the singular</v>

145
00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:22.040
<v Speaker 1>word order the basic word order of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Haitian creole as Svo.</v>

146
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:27.070
<v Speaker 1>Similar to an English or in French where</v>
<v Speaker 1>Colin Geo machine meaning I drive a car.</v>

147
00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:29.023
<v Speaker 1>Here's the subject,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the verb and the object and yellen is </v>

148
00:08:32.301 --> 00:08:33.134
<v Speaker 1>the indefinite article.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adjectives are usually placed after the </v>

149
00:08:35.811 --> 00:08:40.340
<v Speaker 1>now on machine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means I drive a red car,</v>

150
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:41.383
<v Speaker 1>but there is a limited number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>adjectives that come before the noun </v>

151
00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:45.403
<v Speaker 1>verbs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now let's see what happens to this verb </v>

152
00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:49.370
<v Speaker 1>when we change the subject of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sentence.</v>

153
00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:51.560
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

154
00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:52.813
<v Speaker 1>nothing happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are no verb conjugations and </v>

155
00:08:54.831 --> 00:08:57.960
<v Speaker 1>Haitian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The verb doesn't change based on gender,</v>

156
00:08:57.961 --> 00:09:00.510
<v Speaker 1>person or number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about tenses?</v>

157
00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:01.493
<v Speaker 1>Verb tenses are indicated by adding a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tense marker before the verb is the </v>

158
00:09:06.661 --> 00:09:08.190
<v Speaker 1>present.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Continuous marker.</v>

159
00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:10.560
<v Speaker 1>Tay Is the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marker.</v>

160
00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:15.750
<v Speaker 1>Dot is the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Continuous marker is the future tense.</v>

161
00:09:15.751 --> 00:09:20.751
<v Speaker 1>Marker is the near or definite future </v>
<v Speaker 1>marker and uh,</v>

162
00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:22.433
<v Speaker 1>is the conditional marker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No Eileena magazine know this means we </v>

163
00:09:26.161 --> 00:09:28.950
<v Speaker 1>go to the store,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not pollyanna magazine.</v>

164
00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:30.173
<v Speaker 1>This means we are going to the store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And notice here that the personal </v>

165
00:09:33.061 --> 00:09:36.660
<v Speaker 1>pronoun is the short form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The short forms of the personal pronouns</v>

166
00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:39.270
<v Speaker 1>are generally interchangeable with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>long forms,</v>

167
00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.810
<v Speaker 1>but before op and the short form is </v>
<v Speaker 1>normally used.</v>

168
00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:44.213
<v Speaker 1>Nuclear Eileena magazine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means we're going to the store in </v>

169
00:09:47.761 --> 00:09:50.100
<v Speaker 1>the sense of a near or definite future </v>
<v Speaker 1>action.</v>

170
00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:51.653
<v Speaker 1>Medallian magazine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means we went to the store and so </v>

171
00:09:54.931 --> 00:09:55.440
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

172
00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:56.273
<v Speaker 1>It's really that simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just stick the tense marker before </v>

173
00:09:58.261 --> 00:09:59.094
<v Speaker 1>the verb definite articles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's take a look at this word for a </v>

174
00:10:03.001 --> 00:10:03.834
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a definite article which always </v>

175
00:10:05.551 --> 00:10:07.560
<v Speaker 1>comes after the noun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It modifies.</v>

176
00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:09.870
<v Speaker 1>But this is not the only definite </v>
<v Speaker 1>article.</v>

177
00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:10.763
<v Speaker 1>The definite article changes depending </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the final syllable of the noun that </v>

178
00:10:14.161 --> 00:10:14.994
<v Speaker 1>proceeds it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the noun ends with any of these </v>

179
00:10:17.011 --> 00:10:21.240
<v Speaker 1>combinations of letters or a nasal vowel</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this one in magazine,</v>

180
00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:22.373
<v Speaker 1>the article is if the noun ends in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>oral consonant that is proceeded by an </v>

181
00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:29.610
<v Speaker 1>oral vowel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The article is not,</v>

182
00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:32.340
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leave la the book.</v>

183
00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:36.360
<v Speaker 1>If the noun ends in an oral consonant </v>
<v Speaker 1>proceeded by a nasal vowel,</v>

184
00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:40.290
<v Speaker 1>the article is like Barranquilla the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bank.</v>

185
00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:44.730
<v Speaker 1>If the noun ends in an oral vowel </v>
<v Speaker 1>proceeded by an oral consonant,</v>

186
00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:47.280
<v Speaker 1>the article is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

187
00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:48.960
<v Speaker 1>a the country.</v>

188
00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:53.370
<v Speaker 1>If the noun ends in a nasal consonant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the article is not,</v>

189
00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:58.580
<v Speaker 1>or for example delish the telephone </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>

190
00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:04.820
<v Speaker 1>Yes or no questions can be formed by </v>
<v Speaker 1>using rising intonation or you can place</v>

191
00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:05.873
<v Speaker 1>escape at the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll violations as skilled highly sean </v>

192
00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:12.780
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sk comes from French ESCA.</v>

193
00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:18.030
<v Speaker 1>Open ended questions can be made by </v>
<v Speaker 1>placing a question word at the beginning</v>

194
00:11:18.031 --> 00:11:22.410
<v Speaker 1>before the subject you [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means what are you eating?</v>

195
00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:25.590
<v Speaker 1>Chiesa means what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first piece,</v>

196
00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:26.573
<v Speaker 1>key means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which and is combined with a second </v>

197
00:11:29.071 --> 00:11:29.904
<v Speaker 1>piece.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Pronoun for this or that other </v>

198
00:11:32.551 --> 00:11:34.740
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Words are also formed with Pete.</v>

199
00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:36.023
<v Speaker 1>Do you go through our visa?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means where do you live or more </v>

200
00:11:39.331 --> 00:11:40.830
<v Speaker 1>literally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where are you living?</v>

201
00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:41.993
<v Speaker 1>Because up indicates present continuous </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] means were and comes from </v>

202
00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:51.450
<v Speaker 1>which plus place humiliate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means who are you?</v>

203
00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:52.553
<v Speaker 1>Jeevan means who and the two pieces are </v>
<v Speaker 1>which plus person a couple of more </v>

204
00:11:57.731 --> 00:11:58.564
<v Speaker 1>sentences.</v>

205
00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:01.140
<v Speaker 1>Sassy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She actually,</v>

206
00:12:01.141 --> 00:12:01.974
<v Speaker 1>amway is fascist shim way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means that is my brother's dog in </v>

207
00:12:05.861 --> 00:12:06.694
<v Speaker 1>this as my dog word for word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's this or that is dog brother my and </v>

208
00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:17.910
<v Speaker 1>this or that is dog mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The word saw means either this or that.</v>

209
00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:20.940
<v Speaker 1>So when this case we have two different </v>
<v Speaker 1>dogs,</v>

210
00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:25.030
<v Speaker 1>the meaning of this or that would depend</v>
<v Speaker 1>on which dog you gesture towards.</v>

211
00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:26.043
<v Speaker 1>Say is the Copula verb like to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can see how possession is shown </v>

212
00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:31.083
<v Speaker 1>for amway means my brother because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes after brother and then this whole </v>

213
00:12:35.501 --> 00:12:40.501
<v Speaker 1>phrase comes after the word for dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's my brother's dog by guy.</v>

214
00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.220
<v Speaker 1>Give him one reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We see clear,</v>

215
00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:48.190
<v Speaker 1>don't we by money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means the thing I need is the key.</v>

216
00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:50.930
<v Speaker 1>Please give it to me word for word ets </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

217
00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:55.950
<v Speaker 1>That's I need the is key.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The please give me it here.</v>

218
00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:59.740
<v Speaker 1>You can see that the word k creates a </v>
<v Speaker 1>relative clause.</v>

219
00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:00.843
<v Speaker 1>The thing that I need the definite </v>
<v Speaker 1>article modifies the entire proceeding </v>

220
00:13:04.541 --> 00:13:05.374
<v Speaker 1>phrase thing that I need here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bond is one of the only Haitian creole </v>

221
00:13:09.131 --> 00:13:12.400
<v Speaker 1>verbs that has conjugations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are only two forms,</v>

222
00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:13.573
<v Speaker 1>ball and Bob here you can see that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>indirect object comes right after the </v>

223
00:13:17.261 --> 00:13:21.730
<v Speaker 1>verb and the direct object leap comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>after the indirect object.</v>

224
00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:23.913
<v Speaker 1>As you can see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Haitian creole is a very fun and </v>

225
00:13:25.621 --> 00:13:26.454
<v Speaker 1>interesting language and if you already </v>
<v Speaker 1>know some French then it will probably </v>

226
00:13:29.531 --> 00:13:30.364
<v Speaker 1>be quite interesting to examine Haitian </v>
<v Speaker 1>creole and see how it's similar and </v>

227
00:13:33.371 --> 00:13:34.204
<v Speaker 1>different to French.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that brings me to the question of </v>

228
00:13:36.281 --> 00:13:37.114
<v Speaker 1>the day to Haitian creole speakers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does your knowledge of creole help you </v>

229
00:13:40.271 --> 00:13:42.700
<v Speaker 1>understand French and to French </v>
<v Speaker 1>speakers?</v>

230
00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:46.570
<v Speaker 1>Does your knowledge of French help you </v>
