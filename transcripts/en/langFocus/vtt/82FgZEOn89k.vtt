00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:01.553
<v Speaker 1>Today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'll compare Portuguese with a </v>

2
00:00:03.811 --> 00:00:06.690
<v Speaker 1>special dialect of Portuguese called </v>
<v Speaker 1>Spanish.</v>

3
00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:15.613
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and </v>

4
00:00:17.421 --> 00:00:18.254
<v Speaker 1>my name is Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today's topic is how similar or Spanish </v>

5
00:00:21.111 --> 00:00:23.420
<v Speaker 1>and Portuguese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you probably know,</v>

6
00:00:23.421 --> 00:00:24.254
<v Speaker 1>Spanish and Portuguese are both Ibero </v>
<v Speaker 1>Romance languages that share a common </v>

7
00:00:27.831 --> 00:00:30.230
<v Speaker 1>origin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are different enough that they are</v>

8
00:00:30.231 --> 00:00:32.330
<v Speaker 1>definitely considered different </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages,</v>

9
00:00:32.331 --> 00:00:35.930
<v Speaker 1>but they're also closely related and </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite similar in many ways.</v>

10
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.033
<v Speaker 1>On paper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the two languages look very similar and </v>

11
00:00:38.811 --> 00:00:39.644
<v Speaker 1>speakers of either language can </v>
<v Speaker 1>generally read the other language </v>

12
00:00:42.171 --> 00:00:45.140
<v Speaker 1>without too much trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The spoken language is however,</v>

13
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.033
<v Speaker 1>are more different from each other and </v>
<v Speaker 1>less mutually intelligible than the </v>

14
00:00:48.801 --> 00:00:49.634
<v Speaker 1>written forms and Portuguese speakers </v>
<v Speaker 1>typically understand spoken Spanish </v>

15
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.970
<v Speaker 1>better than Spanish speakers understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese.</v>

16
00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:59.293
<v Speaker 1>Well actually it's mostly because of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>difference in pronunciation between the </v>

17
00:01:02.121 --> 00:01:04.250
<v Speaker 1>two languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we'll get into that a little later.</v>

18
00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.630
<v Speaker 1>Spanish and Portuguese share about 89% </v>
<v Speaker 1>lexical similarity,</v>

19
00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:09.643
<v Speaker 1>meaning that 89% of the words have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cognate or an equivalent in the other </v>

20
00:01:13.251 --> 00:01:14.090
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

21
00:01:14.091 --> 00:01:14.924
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't always mean that 89% of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>words will be the same because some of </v>

22
00:01:18.351 --> 00:01:21.350
<v Speaker 1>the different words are very basic and </v>
<v Speaker 1>common words.</v>

23
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.830
<v Speaker 1>And even though cognit words often look </v>
<v Speaker 1>and sound quite similar,</v>

24
00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:25.693
<v Speaker 1>there are other cognates that have </v>
<v Speaker 1>developed quite differently and now </v>

25
00:01:27.951 --> 00:01:30.170
<v Speaker 1>sound and look quite different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>

26
00:01:30.171 --> 00:01:31.004
<v Speaker 1>this pair of cognates clearly resemble </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other in Spanish moondogs and in </v>

27
00:01:35.331 --> 00:01:39.620
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese and these words mean earth or</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

28
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.540
<v Speaker 1>Now here's a less obvious pair of </v>
<v Speaker 1>cognates in Spanish and in Portuguese.</v>

29
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:45.463
<v Speaker 1>By these words mean fish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's and you can see the connection but </v>

30
00:01:48.201 --> 00:01:49.520
<v Speaker 1>it's not quite so obvious.</v>

31
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:50.653
<v Speaker 1>There are some very common everyday </v>
<v Speaker 1>words that are different in the two </v>

32
00:01:53.241 --> 00:01:54.590
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

33
00:01:54.591 --> 00:01:55.424
<v Speaker 1>in Spanish there's European,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so from the verb Ben Sasse and Yo could </v>

34
00:01:59.531 --> 00:02:00.364
<v Speaker 1>ale from the verb gath which both mean I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think these words have cognates in </v>

35
00:02:04.881 --> 00:02:08.190
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also very common to say it wash</v>

36
00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.110
<v Speaker 1>from the verb is Sean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a Spanish cognitive,</v>

37
00:02:12.111 --> 00:02:15.230
<v Speaker 1>this word I yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it only means to find,</v>

38
00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.093
<v Speaker 1>not to think in Spanish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the verb meet APP meaning to </v>

39
00:02:19.641 --> 00:02:22.250
<v Speaker 1>look at or to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Portuguese.</v>

40
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.113
<v Speaker 1>The common verbiage is we'll learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a Portuguese verb meelod but </v>

41
00:02:27.291 --> 00:02:30.800
<v Speaker 1>it's not commonly used.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Personal pronouns.</v>

42
00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.580
<v Speaker 1>The personal pronouns in the two </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages are generally similar but with</v>

43
00:02:34.581 --> 00:02:36.710
<v Speaker 1>slightly different forms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

44
00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.620
<v Speaker 1>Yo ill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no sutras,</v>

45
00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.790
<v Speaker 1>no rush,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also the formal way of saying you is</v>

46
00:02:43.791 --> 00:02:44.624
<v Speaker 1>normally different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Spanish it's we'll stead in </v>

47
00:02:47.331 --> 00:02:52.331
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese there's a word velocity but </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead people generally say [inaudible]</v>

48
00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.600
<v Speaker 1>and [inaudible] which is like saying sir</v>
<v Speaker 1>or Madam.</v>

49
00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.030
<v Speaker 1>These are equivalents of you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Senorita in Spanish,</v>

50
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.280
<v Speaker 1>but in Spanish they're not used as </v>
<v Speaker 1>pronouns.</v>

51
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:04.653
<v Speaker 1>False friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You will constantly encounter cognates </v>

52
00:03:07.151 --> 00:03:07.984
<v Speaker 1>in Spanish and Portuguese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you'll also encounter lots of false </v>

53
00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:11.314
<v Speaker 1>friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Words that look and sound the same and </v>

54
00:03:12.881 --> 00:03:13.714
<v Speaker 1>might share a common origin but they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning is actually different and some </v>

55
00:03:16.481 --> 00:03:21.130
<v Speaker 1>of these could potentially cause some </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy misunderstandings billado.</v>

56
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.113
<v Speaker 1>In Spanish it means skinned or appealed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but colloquially it also means someone </v>

57
00:03:26.231 --> 00:03:29.020
<v Speaker 1>with a shaved head or a new haircut </v>
<v Speaker 1>glove.</v>

58
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.410
<v Speaker 1>In Portuguese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has the same basic meaning of skinned</v>

59
00:03:32.411 --> 00:03:33.244
<v Speaker 1>or peeled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in Brazilian Portuguese it also </v>

60
00:03:35.321 --> 00:03:37.930
<v Speaker 1>means naked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Portuguese,</v>

61
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:38.793
<v Speaker 1>the word for octopus is both in Spanish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the word for octopus is blue book and </v>

62
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.833
<v Speaker 1>buttered will means dust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also means something sexual and </v>

63
00:03:47.861 --> 00:03:50.290
<v Speaker 1>kids don't google it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Spanish.</v>

64
00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.790
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] means a delicious dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Portuguese,</v>

65
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.790
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] means a weird scene.</v>

66
00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.910
<v Speaker 1>And Center is also a slang word for </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

67
00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.970
<v Speaker 1>So this could mean a weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll be now in Spanish means tip like a</v>

68
00:04:06.611 --> 00:04:07.444
<v Speaker 1>tip for a waiter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] means tuition fees like for </v>

69
00:04:10.751 --> 00:04:13.960
<v Speaker 1>university and in Brazilian Portuguese </v>
<v Speaker 1>it means bribe.</v>

70
00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:18.520
<v Speaker 1>So even though lots of words are pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>much the same in either language,</v>

71
00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:21.700
<v Speaker 1>it might be a little dangerous to assume</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they mean the same thing.</v>

72
00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.850
<v Speaker 1>Pronunciation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The main reason that the spoken forms of</v>

73
00:04:24.851 --> 00:04:25.684
<v Speaker 1>the two languages are less intelligible </v>
<v Speaker 1>than the written forms is because they </v>

74
00:04:28.481 --> 00:04:29.314
<v Speaker 1>differ significantly in phonology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese has much more complex </v>

75
00:04:32.771 --> 00:04:35.440
<v Speaker 1>phonology than Spanish with many extra </v>
<v Speaker 1>sounds,</v>

76
00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.513
<v Speaker 1>and this is one reason that Portuguese </v>
<v Speaker 1>speakers have an easier time </v>

77
00:04:38.891 --> 00:04:41.470
<v Speaker 1>understanding spoken Spanish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then vice versa.</v>

78
00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.850
<v Speaker 1>Consonants in Spanish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The B,</v>

79
00:04:43.851 --> 00:04:47.470
<v Speaker 1>D and g consonants have soft </v>
<v Speaker 1>pronunciations that occur,</v>

80
00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.240
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>between vowels.</v>

81
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.610
<v Speaker 1>The way those soft sounds work is </v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

82
00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.050
<v Speaker 1>In Portuguese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>European,</v>

83
00:04:53.051 --> 00:04:57.070
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese has the soft d sound,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while some Brazilian accents don't.</v>

84
00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:58.870
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Spanish,</v>

85
00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:04.070
<v Speaker 1>Nether in Portuguese mother and in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Brazilian Portuguese,</v>

86
00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.680
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese doesn't have the soft be in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Spanish in Portuguese,</v>

87
00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:13.150
<v Speaker 1>severe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Next,</v>

88
00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:14.253
<v Speaker 1>the rolled our sound of Spanish </v>
<v Speaker 1>corresponds to a rather different sound </v>

89
00:05:17.221 --> 00:05:22.120
<v Speaker 1>in Portuguese when it's at the beginning</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a word or if it's doubled in Spanish.</v>

90
00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.260
<v Speaker 1>Could that be though in Portuguese?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Xapi in Spanish,</v>

91
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.130
<v Speaker 1>in Portuguese too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Next,</v>

92
00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.083
<v Speaker 1>the sound represented by a double l in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Spanish has a corresponding sound in </v>

93
00:05:34.661 --> 00:05:37.900
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese represented by l h for </v>
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>

94
00:05:37.901 --> 00:05:38.734
<v Speaker 1>In Spanish there's and in Portuguese </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's phenomenal meaning fail and </v>

95
00:05:44.201 --> 00:05:47.620
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese has some consonants that </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have an equivalent in Spanish.</v>

96
00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:51.310
<v Speaker 1>First a shutter sound,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's spelled with c h or with x,</v>

97
00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:56.430
<v Speaker 1>so in Spanish we have yellow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in Portuguese chigga meaning arrives</v>

98
00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.900
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] sound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Spanish we have,</v>

99
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.110
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't see it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in Portuguese we have as you can see</v>

100
00:06:03.111 --> 00:06:03.650
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

101
00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:06.950
<v Speaker 1>This is another example of a difference </v>
<v Speaker 1>in soft consonants.</v>

102
00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:07.963
<v Speaker 1>In both languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The letter g represents a soft g sound </v>

103
00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:14.150
<v Speaker 1>rather than a go when it's followed by </v>
<v Speaker 1>an e or an I.</v>

104
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.850
<v Speaker 1>But the soft sound is different in </v>
<v Speaker 1>either language.</v>

105
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.833
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

106
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:23.110
<v Speaker 1>I can see here there's this year next a </v>
<v Speaker 1>va sound Spanish doesn't really have a v</v>

107
00:06:24.651 --> 00:06:26.630
<v Speaker 1>sound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does have the soft be,</v>

108
00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:31.040
<v Speaker 1>which kind of sounds similar to a v,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Portuguese has a distinct v sound.</v>

109
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:35.900
<v Speaker 1>So in Spanish we have BC and in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese we have visitor.</v>

110
00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:37.753
<v Speaker 1>In Spanish we have Leonardo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in Portuguese we have leave and one </v>

111
00:06:42.591 --> 00:06:43.424
<v Speaker 1>more a z sound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The sound is not found in many Spanish </v>

112
00:06:47.151 --> 00:06:49.250
<v Speaker 1>words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in Portuguese it's very common.</v>

113
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:50.353
<v Speaker 1>So in Spanish we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at Csun and in Portuguese we have </v>

114
00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:57.080
<v Speaker 1>pcs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This sound is often found between vowels</v>

115
00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:59.870
<v Speaker 1>and at the beginning of words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vowels.</v>

116
00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:03.980
<v Speaker 1>There are quite a few more vowel sounds </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Portuguese than there are in Spanish.</v>

117
00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:04.993
<v Speaker 1>Spanish has five pure vowels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While Portuguese has all of those plus </v>

118
00:07:08.361 --> 00:07:11.930
<v Speaker 1>seven additional ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spanish has just one e sound,</v>

119
00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:12.883
<v Speaker 1>which sounds like a Portuguese has this </v>
<v Speaker 1>and an additional one like the f inset </v>

120
00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:18.253
<v Speaker 1>in Portuguese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's difficult to predict which one to </v>

121
00:07:20.061 --> 00:07:23.270
<v Speaker 1>use in any given word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But these ones are different in Spanish,</v>

122
00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:24.883
<v Speaker 1>in Portuguese mirror,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but these ones are the same in Spanish </v>

123
00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:28.993
<v Speaker 1>Messa and in Portuguese Miza.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When a word has the diphthong ea in </v>

124
00:07:33.411 --> 00:07:34.244
<v Speaker 1>Spanish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it usually corresponds to an open e in </v>

125
00:07:36.471 --> 00:07:38.690
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Spanish.</v>

126
00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:39.553
<v Speaker 1>See it there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in Portuguese said Spanish also has </v>

127
00:07:43.251 --> 00:07:44.150
<v Speaker 1>just one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

128
00:07:44.151 --> 00:07:46.670
<v Speaker 1>sounds like in the word go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but shorter.</v>

129
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.550
<v Speaker 1>But Portuguese has an additional open,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

130
00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:52.340
<v Speaker 1>which sounds like the o and pot in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Spanish.</v>

131
00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.890
<v Speaker 1>A bill in Portuguese or view.</v>

132
00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:59.510
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes the diphthong were in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Spanish corresponds to the open.</v>

133
00:07:59.511 --> 00:08:00.620
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Portuguese.</v>

134
00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:04.880
<v Speaker 1>So in Spanish we have escuela and in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese we have scholar.</v>

135
00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.930
<v Speaker 1>Now these might not seem like major </v>
<v Speaker 1>differences so far,</v>

136
00:08:08.931 --> 00:08:11.120
<v Speaker 1>but there are lots of differences like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

137
00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:11.983
<v Speaker 1>Reduced vowels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vowels in Spanish are quite clearly </v>

138
00:08:14.331 --> 00:08:15.164
<v Speaker 1>pronounced in their full form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but vowels in Portuguese often become </v>

139
00:08:18.051 --> 00:08:18.884
<v Speaker 1>reduced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when they are unstressed at </v>

140
00:08:20.511 --> 00:08:23.730
<v Speaker 1>the end of a word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in Spanish we have Gasa,</v>

141
00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:28.440
<v Speaker 1>but in Portuguese we have Casa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Spanish we have it.</v>

142
00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:33.350
<v Speaker 1>And in Portuguese we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Spanish we have Audi,</v>

143
00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:38.620
<v Speaker 1>which means it opens and in Portuguese </v>
<v Speaker 1>we have nasal vowels.</v>

144
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:43.070
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese also has five nasal vowels </v>
<v Speaker 1>that don't occur in Spanish.</v>

145
00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:46.670
<v Speaker 1>I nasal vowel means that some air is </v>
<v Speaker 1>released through your nose,</v>

146
00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:47.533
<v Speaker 1>which creates a distinct sound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vowels become nasal [inaudible] when </v>

147
00:08:49.941 --> 00:08:54.941
<v Speaker 1>they are followed by a nasal consonant </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Emma or an n in Spanish and data and</v>

148
00:08:55.741 --> 00:08:58.860
<v Speaker 1>in Portuguese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Spanish,</v>

149
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.140
<v Speaker 1>in Suunto and in Portuguese.</v>

150
00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:03.473
<v Speaker 1>This also happens when there is a Tilda </v>
<v Speaker 1>over a vowel like in this Portuguese </v>

151
00:09:06.631 --> 00:09:08.910
<v Speaker 1>word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Itamar meaning sister.</v>

152
00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:11.760
<v Speaker 1>Because of the extra vowels in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese,</v>

153
00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:12.623
<v Speaker 1>there are also more diphthongs meaning </v>
<v Speaker 1>two vowels that blend together in one </v>

154
00:09:15.721 --> 00:09:18.150
<v Speaker 1>syllable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This includes some nasal diphthongs.</v>

155
00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:20.910
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Spanish we have six cm,</v>

156
00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:21.953
<v Speaker 1>but in Portuguese it's six sound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Spanish we have limonus and in </v>

157
00:09:26.821 --> 00:09:27.654
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese Lee Moreish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Little differences like these add up to </v>

158
00:09:31.441 --> 00:09:34.350
<v Speaker 1>make Portuguese and Spanish sound rather</v>
<v Speaker 1>different grammar.</v>

159
00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:37.890
<v Speaker 1>Spanish and Portuguese grammar are </v>
<v Speaker 1>generally very similar,</v>

160
00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.290
<v Speaker 1>but they do have numerous differences as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

161
00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:41.153
<v Speaker 1>Gender,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both languages basically have two </v>

162
00:09:42.871 --> 00:09:44.520
<v Speaker 1>genders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>masculine and feminine,</v>

163
00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:47.760
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes the gender of cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 1>words is different.</v>

164
00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:48.743
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>words in Spanish ending with our </v>

165
00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:52.343
<v Speaker 1>masculine and their equivalents in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese ending in honoring our </v>

166
00:09:55.531 --> 00:09:59.010
<v Speaker 1>feminine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in Spanish we have and we actually,</v>

167
00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:02.880
<v Speaker 1>which is masculine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in Portuguese we have [inaudible],</v>

168
00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:03.923
<v Speaker 1>which is feminine.</v>

169
00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:05.363
<v Speaker 1>Both languages have for definite </v>
<v Speaker 1>articles for the two genders and </v>

170
00:10:07.951 --> 00:10:08.784
<v Speaker 1>singular and plural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But notice that Spanish also has the </v>

171
00:10:11.311 --> 00:10:15.570
<v Speaker 1>neuter singular definite article.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not used with nouns,</v>

172
00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:19.590
<v Speaker 1>but with adjectives or possessive </v>
<v Speaker 1>pronouns in order to use them like nouns</v>

173
00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:20.453
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] which means the important </v>

174
00:10:23.491 --> 00:10:27.210
<v Speaker 1>thing is love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Portuguese it would be,</v>

175
00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:31.290
<v Speaker 1>we pretend they were more with all being</v>
<v Speaker 1>the masculine,</v>

176
00:10:31.291 --> 00:10:34.110
<v Speaker 1>singular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definite article verbs.</v>

177
00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:37.260
<v Speaker 1>The way verb tenses work in the two </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages is very similar.</v>

178
00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:38.153
<v Speaker 1>Almost all verb tenses have an exact </v>
<v Speaker 1>equivalent in the other language just </v>

179
00:10:41.401 --> 00:10:45.620
<v Speaker 1>with slightly different conjugations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in Spanish we have no sodas,</v>

180
00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:46.590
<v Speaker 1>common,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most best color,</v>

181
00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:51.110
<v Speaker 1>which means we eat fish and in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese that would be nauseous.</v>

182
00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:56.250
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] saw the present tense form </v>
<v Speaker 1>is the same and next to pass 10 sentence</v>

183
00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.100
<v Speaker 1>in Spanish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bias commit.</v>

184
00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:02.620
<v Speaker 1>On best callow they ate fish and in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese eels middle by.</v>

185
00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:04.313
<v Speaker 1>In this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the conjugations aren't exactly the </v>

186
00:11:05.611 --> 00:11:06.900
<v Speaker 1>same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they are equivalent.</v>

187
00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:10.360
<v Speaker 1>Now a future sentence in Spanish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yoko made episcopal,</v>

188
00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:15.370
<v Speaker 1>which means I will eat fish and in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese it's it will come right page,</v>

189
00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:19.200
<v Speaker 1>but without any context given for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>simple future tense here,</v>

190
00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:20.063
<v Speaker 1>this might sound kind of stiff and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people often use the going to future </v>

191
00:11:23.131 --> 00:11:23.964
<v Speaker 1>form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead.</v>

192
00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:28.200
<v Speaker 1>In Portuguese it would be ill for middle</v>
<v Speaker 1>based and it's Spanish.</v>

193
00:11:28.201 --> 00:11:29.500
<v Speaker 1>It would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

194
00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:30.020
<v Speaker 1>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

195
00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:30.853
<v Speaker 1>Metaphase Pescara.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One difference in the verb system is </v>

196
00:11:33.301 --> 00:11:36.570
<v Speaker 1>that the perfect tense is formed with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the different auxiliary verb,</v>

197
00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:39.810
<v Speaker 1>Spanish uses and then as the auxiliary </v>
<v Speaker 1>verb,</v>

198
00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:43.200
<v Speaker 1>which means to have but only as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>auxiliary verb.</v>

199
00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.050
<v Speaker 1>The main verb for to have in Spanish is </v>
<v Speaker 1>Denette.</v>

200
00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:47.693
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese has a verb or veal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but instead the verb did is used as the </v>

201
00:11:52.021 --> 00:11:56.410
<v Speaker 1>auxiliary verb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means to have tish is a cognate of</v>

202
00:11:56.411 --> 00:11:57.200
<v Speaker 1>Spanish.</v>

203
00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:58.033
<v Speaker 1>Dennis in Spanish we have a laser liver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means I have read the book and in </v>

204
00:12:04.091 --> 00:12:06.040
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese we have bill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

205
00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:06.883
<v Speaker 1>Leave Lever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means I have been reading the </v>

206
00:12:08.711 --> 00:12:09.544
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So notice that the auxiliary verbs are </v>

207
00:12:10.961 --> 00:12:11.794
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And notice that the past participle of </v>

208
00:12:13.511 --> 00:12:14.740
<v Speaker 1>the verb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning reed,</v>

209
00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:17.320
<v Speaker 1>is almost the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but more importantly,</v>

210
00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:18.303
<v Speaker 1>note that this type of sentence means </v>
<v Speaker 1>something different than either </v>

211
00:12:20.201 --> 00:12:22.930
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Spanish it means I have read the book</v>

212
00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:25.810
<v Speaker 1>in Portuguese it means I have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>reading the book.</v>

213
00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:26.793
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the past action is still continuing in </v>

214
00:12:29.111 --> 00:12:31.660
<v Speaker 1>order to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have read the book in Portuguese,</v>

215
00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:34.720
<v Speaker 1>you would use the present tense instead </v>
<v Speaker 1>like this,</v>

216
00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:38.560
<v Speaker 1>the only leave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that Latin American Spanish is</v>

217
00:12:38.561 --> 00:12:39.394
<v Speaker 1>more like Portuguese in this regard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that difference is only in the </v>

218
00:12:42.161 --> 00:12:43.240
<v Speaker 1>present.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>

219
00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:45.700
<v Speaker 1>The past perfect doesn't have that kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of difference.</v>

220
00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:48.730
<v Speaker 1>So if we want to express,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had read the book.</v>

221
00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:49.623
<v Speaker 1>In Spanish we would say ibm laser liver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in Portuguese we would say </v>

222
00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:54.573
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] believe the main difference </v>
<v Speaker 1>between these two is just the auxiliary </v>

223
00:12:58.511 --> 00:12:59.830
<v Speaker 1>verb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd order.</v>

224
00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:00.873
<v Speaker 1>The word order is generally quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>similar between the two languages as </v>

225
00:13:03.491 --> 00:13:04.324
<v Speaker 1>you've probably noticed already,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are some differences too in </v>

226
00:13:07.181 --> 00:13:09.130
<v Speaker 1>yes or no questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Spanish,</v>

227
00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:12.250
<v Speaker 1>the subject can come either before or </v>
<v Speaker 1>after the verb.</v>

228
00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:16.380
<v Speaker 1>Like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've lay gang lists or a gambling lists,</v>

229
00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:19.030
<v Speaker 1>but in Portuguese it must come before </v>
<v Speaker 1>the verb,</v>

230
00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:20.073
<v Speaker 1>like this lfl English,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the placement of object pronouns in </v>

231
00:13:24.341 --> 00:13:26.980
<v Speaker 1>Spanish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the object Pronoun normally comes before</v>

232
00:13:26.981 --> 00:13:29.400
<v Speaker 1>the verb for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Mia you though,</v>

233
00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:33.310
<v Speaker 1>which means he helped me in Portuguese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it comes after the verb,</v>

234
00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:34.353
<v Speaker 1>like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Il [inaudible] another example in </v>

235
00:13:37.031 --> 00:13:38.570
<v Speaker 1>Spanish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's how you that.</v>

236
00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:39.453
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means are you going to help me or </v>

237
00:13:40.691 --> 00:13:41.380
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

238
00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:45.600
<v Speaker 1>And in Portuguese [inaudible] or visors </v>
<v Speaker 1>d'adamo cave.</v>

239
00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:46.923
<v Speaker 1>Actually the location of the Pronoun in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the first sentence is something that </v>

240
00:13:49.811 --> 00:13:50.644
<v Speaker 1>comes from Brazilian Portuguese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at sometimes used in Portugal too </v>

241
00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:54.573
<v Speaker 1>because of the influence of Brazilian </v>
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese through Brazilian tv shows </v>

242
00:13:57.491 --> 00:14:00.310
<v Speaker 1>and the like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people consider the second sentence</v>

243
00:14:00.311 --> 00:14:01.144
<v Speaker 1>to be more proper in European Portuguese</v>
<v Speaker 1>contractions with prepositions in </v>

244
00:14:05.771 --> 00:14:06.604
<v Speaker 1>Spanish prepositions mostly function as </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual units with just these </v>

245
00:14:10.001 --> 00:14:10.834
<v Speaker 1>exceptions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The preposition that plus the definite </v>

246
00:14:13.001 --> 00:14:16.510
<v Speaker 1>article l becomes Dell meaning from </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

247
00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:21.110
<v Speaker 1>the preposition plus l becomes added </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning to the,</v>

248
00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:22.113
<v Speaker 1>there are just those two in Spanish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in Portuguese prepositions form all </v>

249
00:14:24.821 --> 00:14:28.090
<v Speaker 1>sorts of contractions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in Spanish we have an [inaudible],</v>

250
00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:31.720
<v Speaker 1>which means in the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in Portuguese we have new leaf.</v>

251
00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:35.050
<v Speaker 1>In Spanish we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will not send Yoda,</v>

252
00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:39.270
<v Speaker 1>which means from a lady,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in Portuguese we have Duma,</v>

253
00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:41.320
<v Speaker 1>slaughter it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spanish.</v>

254
00:14:41.321 --> 00:14:46.090
<v Speaker 1>We have the Aqi meaning from here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in Portuguese we have the Geek.</v>

255
00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:51.543
<v Speaker 1>These mean Portuguese is a sister </v>
<v Speaker 1>language of Spanish in Spanish and in </v>

256
00:14:58.461 --> 00:15:03.410
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] word for word ets.</v>

257
00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:06.560
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese is ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>

258
00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:07.423
<v Speaker 1>sister of the Spanish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These sentences consistent tiredly of </v>

259
00:15:10.731 --> 00:15:11.564
<v Speaker 1>cognates and have identical grammar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The main difference is the different </v>

260
00:15:14.331 --> 00:15:15.164
<v Speaker 1>definite articles and the words for </v>
<v Speaker 1>sister take a somewhat different form </v>

261
00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:19.770
<v Speaker 1>and Amana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat,</v>

262
00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:20.663
<v Speaker 1>emote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This pair of words is a good example of </v>

263
00:15:22.521 --> 00:15:23.354
<v Speaker 1>how Spanish and Portuguese cognates can </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes look and sound quite </v>

264
00:15:26.271 --> 00:15:27.104
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at one more sentence and see </v>

265
00:15:29.901 --> 00:15:30.734
<v Speaker 1>what we find.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These mean very few countries in the </v>

266
00:15:32.781 --> 00:15:33.614
<v Speaker 1>world take pride in having so many </v>
<v Speaker 1>different styles of music and dance in </v>

267
00:15:37.281 --> 00:15:38.470
<v Speaker 1>Spanish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mig,</v>

268
00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:39.313
<v Speaker 1>Bogo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spices and Amanda [inaudible] word for </v>

269
00:15:44.421 --> 00:15:48.620
<v Speaker 1>word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very few countries in the world are</v>

270
00:15:48.621 --> 00:15:53.420
<v Speaker 1>proud of having so many styles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different of music and dance.</v>

271
00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:54.883
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the Portuguese sentence</v>
<v Speaker 1>went to Portuguese removed store of </v>

272
00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:58.640
<v Speaker 1>yours.</v>

273
00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:02.120
<v Speaker 1>10 stills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the [inaudible] word for word.</v>

274
00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:07.180
<v Speaker 1>Very few countries in the world are </v>
<v Speaker 1>proud of having so many styles,</v>

275
00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:12.380
<v Speaker 1>different of music and dance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

276
00:16:12.381 --> 00:16:15.110
<v Speaker 1>these sentences are similar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are a few differences.</v>

277
00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:18.230
<v Speaker 1>The way of expressing very few,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's slightly different,</v>

278
00:16:18.231 --> 00:16:20.540
<v Speaker 1>but the words are cognates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Next,</v>

279
00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:21.433
<v Speaker 1>notice that in Portuguese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the preposition and definite article </v>

280
00:16:23.811 --> 00:16:27.620
<v Speaker 1>contract together into one word while in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spanish they're separate words.</v>

281
00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:31.850
<v Speaker 1>Next we see the verb corresponding to to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be in each language.</v>

282
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.050
<v Speaker 1>Is that in Spanish and also she taught </v>
<v Speaker 1>him in Portuguese.</v>

283
00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:38.540
<v Speaker 1>They are both conjugated in the third </v>
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

284
00:16:38.541 --> 00:16:39.800
<v Speaker 1>plural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Present tense,</v>

285
00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:43.460
<v Speaker 1>but you can see that the conjugated </v>
<v Speaker 1>forms are different in either language.</v>

286
00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:46.220
<v Speaker 1>Next,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the words here are a bit different.</v>

287
00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:47.293
<v Speaker 1>The Spanish word is an infinitive form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While the Portuguese is a personal </v>

288
00:16:50.871 --> 00:16:53.540
<v Speaker 1>infinitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The infinitive by itself is,</v>

289
00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:57.350
<v Speaker 1>and also notice that the word for dance </v>
<v Speaker 1>is different,</v>

290
00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:01.560
<v Speaker 1>but also notice that it sounds like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>English word ballet by Lee.</v>

291
00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:02.973
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's also a cognate word in </v>

292
00:17:04.821 --> 00:17:05.654
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese bile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in Portuguese it refers to an event </v>

293
00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:09.523
<v Speaker 1>like a ball or a prom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in Spanish there's also the word </v>

294
00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:13.413
<v Speaker 1>done Fao,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which refers to a specific types of </v>

295
00:17:15.411 --> 00:17:18.260
<v Speaker 1>artistic dance as opposed to dancing in </v>
<v Speaker 1>general.</v>

296
00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:22.190
<v Speaker 1>Very often there are possible cognates </v>
<v Speaker 1>for every word in a sentence,</v>

297
00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:23.053
<v Speaker 1>but they sometimes have a somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 1>different usage or frequency of use in </v>

298
00:17:26.061 --> 00:17:28.910
<v Speaker 1>either language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In these two similar sentences,</v>

299
00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:32.750
<v Speaker 1>we see how similar the two languages can</v>
<v Speaker 1>be with the biggest difference,</v>

300
00:17:32.751 --> 00:17:33.584
<v Speaker 1>simply lying in pronunciation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but things are often said more </v>

301
00:17:35.931 --> 00:17:37.610
<v Speaker 1>differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

302
00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:38.473
<v Speaker 1>a somewhat more natural sentence in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese might be more into </v>

303
00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:44.730
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>tench steels,</v>

304
00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:49.770
<v Speaker 1>differential killers in this variation </v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than to be plus an adjective.</v>

305
00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:53.430
<v Speaker 1>Here we have Ken plus the infinitive of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a verb,</v>

306
00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:56.610
<v Speaker 1>meaning to be proud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as you can see,</v>

307
00:17:56.611 --> 00:18:00.570
<v Speaker 1>Spanish and Portuguese are indeed sister</v>
<v Speaker 1>languages that have a lot in common.</v>

308
00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:01.583
<v Speaker 1>They do have a lot of little differences</v>
<v Speaker 1>that altogether and make them distinct </v>

309
00:18:04.561 --> 00:18:05.394
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But knowing either language would </v>

310
00:18:07.081 --> 00:18:09.870
<v Speaker 1>definitely help you learn the other one </v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively quickly.</v>

311
00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:14.250
<v Speaker 1>So the question of the day for speakers </v>
<v Speaker 1>of either Spanish or Portuguese who have</v>

312
00:18:14.251 --> 00:18:15.084
<v Speaker 1>studied the other language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you find it easy to learn what was </v>

313
00:18:17.881 --> 00:18:19.920
<v Speaker 1>easy and what was challenging?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

314
00:18:19.921 --> 00:18:20.754
<v Speaker 1>feel free to share other examples of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their similarities and differences in </v>
