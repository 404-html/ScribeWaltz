<v Speaker 1>Quinn when Nanjie a zine are a queen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When Umangi a zine or man,</v>

2
00:00:11.071 --> 00:00:13.080
<v Speaker 1>these people in Beijing don't speak </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese.</v>

3
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.540
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I need to speak louder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Queen [inaudible] Queen.</v>

4
00:00:18.541 --> 00:00:19.920
<v Speaker 1>When Angie a zine or</v>

5
00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.150
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

6
00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:29.410
<v Speaker 1>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is Paul.</v>

7
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.190
<v Speaker 1>The title of this video is why your </v>
<v Speaker 1>phrasebook fails you.</v>

8
00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:34.743
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people buy a phrase book right </v>
<v Speaker 1>before the start of their trip or they </v>

9
00:00:37.781 --> 00:00:38.614
<v Speaker 1>buy a phrase book at the airport after </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've checked in for their flight or </v>

10
00:00:41.171 --> 00:00:44.410
<v Speaker 1>they buy their phrase book after they've</v>
<v Speaker 1>arrived at their destination.</v>

11
00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:45.723
<v Speaker 1>And quite often these people claim that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there for his book wasn't helpful for </v>

12
00:00:48.581 --> 00:00:49.414
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but didn't help them communicate with </v>

13
00:00:50.171 --> 00:00:51.004
<v Speaker 1>the locals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well of course it didn't because you </v>

14
00:00:53.591 --> 00:00:57.880
<v Speaker 1>didn't use your phrase book to study.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You didn't use it the right way.</v>

15
00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.760
<v Speaker 1>So I would like to call this video </v>
<v Speaker 1>something else.</v>

16
00:01:00.761 --> 00:01:01.594
<v Speaker 1>I like to call it why you fail your </v>
<v Speaker 1>phrase book your phrasebook had high </v>

17
00:01:05.891 --> 00:01:06.724
<v Speaker 1>hopes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your phrase book really wanted to be </v>

18
00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:09.850
<v Speaker 1>your sidekick and wanted to help you </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

19
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.510
<v Speaker 1>Had wanted to be a tool that you used.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wanted you to take the lead.</v>

20
00:01:13.511 --> 00:01:15.700
<v Speaker 1>So it could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's best to help you.</v>

21
00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.880
<v Speaker 1>But unfortunately you let you a phrase </v>
<v Speaker 1>book down.</v>

22
00:01:18.881 --> 00:01:19.714
<v Speaker 1>You didn't take the lead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you tried to give the lead over to the </v>

23
00:01:22.031 --> 00:01:24.520
<v Speaker 1>phrase book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>expect it to do everything for you.</v>

24
00:01:24.521 --> 00:01:27.010
<v Speaker 1>And I have news for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>

25
00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.610
<v Speaker 1>phrase books are not human.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't take the lead,</v>

26
00:01:30.611 --> 00:01:32.740
<v Speaker 1>they can't communicate for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just a tool.</v>

27
00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.410
<v Speaker 1>So you need to use them the right way.</v>

28
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.740
<v Speaker 1>Basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you use your phrase book,</v>

29
00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to pull phrases out on the fly,</v>

30
00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.540
<v Speaker 1>just to look things up when you're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>about your,</v>

31
00:01:45.541 --> 00:01:46.374
<v Speaker 1>your trip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're shopping and you need to </v>

32
00:01:47.431 --> 00:01:48.264
<v Speaker 1>look something up so you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look in the shopping section and </v>

33
00:01:50.011 --> 00:01:52.050
<v Speaker 1>find a phrase that suitable for what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>need.</v>

34
00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.060
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically it's going to fail you.</v>

35
00:01:54.061 --> 00:01:57.360
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to work like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You really need to do this.</v>

36
00:01:57.361 --> 00:01:58.194
<v Speaker 1>You need to use your phrase book as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tool to study and learn some of the </v>

37
00:02:00.841 --> 00:02:02.130
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you do that,</v>

38
00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.100
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to have a much better </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience with it.</v>

39
00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.240
<v Speaker 1>So how can you make your phrase but </v>
<v Speaker 1>useful as a tool for studying?</v>

40
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.103
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing you need to do when you </v>

41
00:02:12.061 --> 00:02:14.160
<v Speaker 1>start learning a new language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even with a phrase book,</v>

42
00:02:14.161 --> 00:02:17.250
<v Speaker 1>just for travel purposes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to get the phonology down.</v>

43
00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.170
<v Speaker 1>You need to learn the sounds of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>

44
00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.420
<v Speaker 1>how to understand them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how to pronounce them.</v>

45
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.190
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's point blank.</v>

46
00:02:23.191 --> 00:02:25.410
<v Speaker 1>The number one thing you need to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you don't,</v>

47
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:26.363
<v Speaker 1>nobody's going to understand you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to be able to </v>

48
00:02:28.441 --> 00:02:29.274
<v Speaker 1>understand them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It depends on the language to some </v>

49
00:02:30.451 --> 00:02:31.400
<v Speaker 1>extent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

50
00:02:31.401 --> 00:02:32.234
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some languages have quite simple </v>

51
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:34.403
<v Speaker 1>phonological systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you're learning a language with </v>

52
00:02:36.271 --> 00:02:37.950
<v Speaker 1>tones or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>

53
00:02:37.951 --> 00:02:41.100
<v Speaker 1>that's new to you and you don't put in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time to learn that first.</v>

54
00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.260
<v Speaker 1>And if you just read the phrase out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the phrase book,</v>

55
00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:44.423
<v Speaker 1>it's not gonna come out the way people </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand it will just sound like </v>

56
00:02:47.371 --> 00:02:48.090
<v Speaker 1>jibberish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

57
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.210
<v Speaker 1>So you need to get the phonology down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can do that before your trip,</v>

58
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.500
<v Speaker 1>hopefully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

59
00:02:52.501 --> 00:02:53.334
<v Speaker 1>get on the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look for some examples of the </v>

60
00:02:54.451 --> 00:02:55.350
<v Speaker 1>pronunciation.</v>

61
00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.050
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take a lesson or two if you can like get</v>

62
00:02:58.051 --> 00:03:01.110
<v Speaker 1>even on Skype,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get a teacher from I talky and uh,</v>

63
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.660
<v Speaker 1>take some skype lessons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll help you with the pronunciation.</v>

64
00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.320
<v Speaker 1>And I've tried to get that down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or once you arrive at your destination,</v>

65
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.060
<v Speaker 1>talk to a local,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get some help from them.</v>

66
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.700
<v Speaker 1>But the point is you need to learn what </v>
<v Speaker 1>those sounds are,</v>

67
00:03:12.701 --> 00:03:15.580
<v Speaker 1>how to produce them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>practice a bit and get used to that.</v>

68
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.193
<v Speaker 1>So that's the first thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next thing is to learn the basic </v>

69
00:03:19.751 --> 00:03:23.230
<v Speaker 1>sentence patterns of the language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now for his books are great because they</v>

70
00:03:23.231 --> 00:03:27.850
<v Speaker 1>have tons of examples of basic sentence </v>
<v Speaker 1>patterns right now.</v>

71
00:03:27.851 --> 00:03:28.684
<v Speaker 1>So you can just read through them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get a sense for how to build </v>

72
00:03:30.911 --> 00:03:33.130
<v Speaker 1>simple sentences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people are like me,</v>

73
00:03:33.131 --> 00:03:33.964
<v Speaker 1>they're kind of inductive learners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They like to just look at the examples </v>

74
00:03:36.431 --> 00:03:38.620
<v Speaker 1>that figure it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at the examples and we think,</v>

75
00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.030
<v Speaker 1>hm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this must be the subject.</v>

76
00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.070
<v Speaker 1>This must be the object,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this must be the bourbon.</v>

77
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.113
<v Speaker 1>We like to figure it out from examples </v>
<v Speaker 1>and compare different examples and see </v>

78
00:03:46.151 --> 00:03:49.330
<v Speaker 1>what goes where and learn how to piece </v>
<v Speaker 1>together sentences.</v>

79
00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.520
<v Speaker 1>So if you're an inductive learner like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

80
00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:52.383
<v Speaker 1>then you can just flip through it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at similar sentences and try to </v>

81
00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:55.990
<v Speaker 1>figure out what parts mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

82
00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.700
<v Speaker 1>learn how to build the sentences </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

83
00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.120
<v Speaker 1>Some people are not like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're more productive learners.</v>

84
00:04:01.121 --> 00:04:04.000
<v Speaker 1>They like to have the rule first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd like to know the grammar rule,</v>

85
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.600
<v Speaker 1>and then they can look at the examples </v>
<v Speaker 1>in that makes sense to them because they</v>

86
00:04:07.601 --> 00:04:09.040
<v Speaker 1>already know the rule,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

87
00:04:09.041 --> 00:04:11.050
<v Speaker 1>Some people are more like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you'd like that,</v>

88
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:12.513
<v Speaker 1>no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because most phrase books have a pretty </v>

89
00:04:13.691 --> 00:04:16.750
<v Speaker 1>good grammar section.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's short usually,</v>

90
00:04:16.751 --> 00:04:17.584
<v Speaker 1>but it gives you the basics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just the basic enough explanation to </v>

91
00:04:20.261 --> 00:04:22.060
<v Speaker 1>understand the examples,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to read that.</v>

92
00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.193
<v Speaker 1>Then flip through the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>find examples and try to match them up </v>

93
00:04:26.681 --> 00:04:28.840
<v Speaker 1>with the rules and see how they make </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense to you.</v>

94
00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.780
<v Speaker 1>So get the sentence structure down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the second thing.</v>

95
00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.390
<v Speaker 1>The third thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a third thing is vocab.</v>

96
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.130
<v Speaker 1>Get some vocabulary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

97
00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.980
<v Speaker 1>Phrase books are good because they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>every day vocabulary.</v>

98
00:04:38.981 --> 00:04:39.814
<v Speaker 1>It's you'd stuff that's useful in </v>
<v Speaker 1>regular daily life situations and you </v>

99
00:04:43.121 --> 00:04:45.530
<v Speaker 1>can look up different kinds of topics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

100
00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:47.830
<v Speaker 1>phrase books are usually arranged by </v>
<v Speaker 1>topic or subject,</v>

101
00:04:47.831 --> 00:04:50.440
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a section on maybe like going</v>

102
00:04:50.441 --> 00:04:52.180
<v Speaker 1>out and partying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like one section.</v>

103
00:04:52.181 --> 00:04:55.720
<v Speaker 1>So some of the phrases might be like how</v>
<v Speaker 1>to order a drink or how to talk to a new</v>

104
00:04:55.721 --> 00:04:56.554
<v Speaker 1>person in the bar or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there might be a section on going </v>

105
00:04:59.321 --> 00:05:01.240
<v Speaker 1>to the hospital if you're someone with </v>
<v Speaker 1>an illness,</v>

106
00:05:01.241 --> 00:05:02.680
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can look up that section.</v>

107
00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.670
<v Speaker 1>So whatever vocabulary you might need in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe,</v>

108
00:05:06.671 --> 00:05:10.750
<v Speaker 1>kind of travel or um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for your own lifestyle or whatever,</v>

109
00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.600
<v Speaker 1>then you can look up that vocab and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can learn it.</v>

110
00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:16.930
<v Speaker 1>So the way I like to learn vocabulary is</v>
<v Speaker 1>using,</v>

111
00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:18.400
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one way,</v>

112
00:05:18.401 --> 00:05:19.234
<v Speaker 1>it's just kind of a shortcut method,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess you can put it into a chunky </v>

113
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:25.240
<v Speaker 1>monkey is a flashcard system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

114
00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.050
<v Speaker 1>it's this flashcard application for your</v>
<v Speaker 1>smart phone or also on the computer.</v>

115
00:05:29.051 --> 00:05:31.120
<v Speaker 1>You can get it for free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's free on Android,</v>

116
00:05:31.121 --> 00:05:32.140
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

117
00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:34.360
<v Speaker 1>on Ios.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to pay some money for it,</v>

118
00:05:34.361 --> 00:05:35.530
<v Speaker 1>but it's worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's awesome.</v>

119
00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:36.813
<v Speaker 1>So you can build up a basic vocabulary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>load those words into a Hanky and enjoy </v>

120
00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.313
<v Speaker 1>yourself on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So words or phrases or even full </v>

121
00:05:43.301 --> 00:05:45.400
<v Speaker 1>sentences if you are getting to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>

122
00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:48.280
<v Speaker 1>load them in and then drill yourself on </v>
<v Speaker 1>those vocab.</v>

123
00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.370
<v Speaker 1>So you can do that one of the plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can do that whenever you've got free</v>

124
00:05:51.371 --> 00:05:52.390
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

125
00:05:52.391 --> 00:05:53.224
<v Speaker 1>on keys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>

126
00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:56.860
<v Speaker 1>So you can just look through the phrase </v>
<v Speaker 1>book based on topic,</v>

127
00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:01.510
<v Speaker 1>on based on just what everyday words you</v>
<v Speaker 1>think you will need a little demand.</v>

128
00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:02.630
<v Speaker 1>Study them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

129
00:06:02.631 --> 00:06:04.700
<v Speaker 1>so that's the three things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get the phonology down,</v>

130
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.100
<v Speaker 1>get a sense for the basic sentence </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure,</v>

131
00:06:07.101 --> 00:06:09.830
<v Speaker 1>get some basic vocabulary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And once you have those things,</v>

132
00:06:09.831 --> 00:06:12.640
<v Speaker 1>then now you've used the phrase book </v>
<v Speaker 1>well at,</v>

133
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:15.050
<v Speaker 1>and now you're in a good position to </v>
<v Speaker 1>look stuff up.</v>

134
00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:15.973
<v Speaker 1>If you need something on the fly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you try to look stuff up on the fly </v>

135
00:06:19.011 --> 00:06:21.560
<v Speaker 1>without having any basic understanding </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the language yet,</v>

136
00:06:21.561 --> 00:06:23.840
<v Speaker 1>then you're not going to understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>their response,</v>

137
00:06:23.841 --> 00:06:27.620
<v Speaker 1>even if they understood you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've got to do some studying.</v>

138
00:06:27.621 --> 00:06:31.280
<v Speaker 1>Use it as a tool to learn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just as some kind of little,</v>

139
00:06:31.281 --> 00:06:32.114
<v Speaker 1>a magic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a magic toy that's going to speak for </v>

140
00:06:35.421 --> 00:06:36.254
<v Speaker 1>you and get the job done for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you've got to put in the effort </v>

141
00:06:38.091 --> 00:06:40.040
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the fun of it.</v>

142
00:06:40.041 --> 00:06:40.874
<v Speaker 1>That's what makes communicating fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where it makes learning a </v>

143
00:06:42.951 --> 00:06:45.230
<v Speaker 1>language fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So do it yourself.</v>

144
00:06:45.231 --> 00:06:46.970
<v Speaker 1>Don't expect the phrase book to do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>for you.</v>

145
00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:50.390
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the basic message later,</v>

146
00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:58.310
<v Speaker 1>we just edit that part out so.</v>
