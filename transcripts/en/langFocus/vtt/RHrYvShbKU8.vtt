1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.060
<v Speaker 1>Back by not so popular demand meaning </v>
<v Speaker 1>about one third of my viewers love these</v>

2
00:00:05.911 --> 00:00:08.130
<v Speaker 1>videos and the other two thirds are </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.450
<v Speaker 1>it's another episode of mystery </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>

4
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:13.673
<v Speaker 1>I will give you some samples of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>language and you have to guess what </v>

5
00:00:16.081 --> 00:00:16.914
<v Speaker 1>language it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might not be able to get the exact </v>

6
00:00:19.081 --> 00:00:19.914
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe you'll be able to guess the </v>

7
00:00:21.091 --> 00:00:21.924
<v Speaker 1>language family or the region or country</v>
<v Speaker 1>where that language is spoken or </v>

8
00:00:24.871 --> 00:00:25.704
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just try to see how close you can get </v>

9
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.610
<v Speaker 1>language number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please listen.</v>

10
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.390
<v Speaker 2>Sherry did see a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did some despite the rotarians.</v>

11
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah I do my lesson but even this one </v>
<v Speaker 2>more to me hit me.</v>

12
00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.500
<v Speaker 2>She Rung,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we lead poison.</v>

13
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.730
<v Speaker 2>Nobody can witness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She should go going back.</v>

14
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.780
<v Speaker 2>Yaba [inaudible] and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause he,</v>

15
00:00:57.971 --> 00:01:01.430
<v Speaker 2>I did some Misha here wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was cynical about very,</v>

16
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.880
<v Speaker 1>now let's see a written sample of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

17
00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.830
<v Speaker 1>So what language do you think it is?</v>

18
00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:28.453
<v Speaker 1>The language is Yoruba.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yoruba is a member of the Niger Congo </v>

19
00:01:31.731 --> 00:01:32.564
<v Speaker 1>language family and is spoken in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>west African countries of Nigeria and </v>

20
00:01:35.751 --> 00:01:39.740
<v Speaker 1>Beneen as well as Togo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an official language in Nigeria and</v>

21
00:01:39.741 --> 00:01:42.320
<v Speaker 1>to spoken by an estimated 30 million </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

22
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:43.303
<v Speaker 1>Current estimates are based on </v>
<v Speaker 1>population growth since 1990 when 18 </v>

23
00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.890
<v Speaker 1>million people spoke it as a native </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

24
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.820
<v Speaker 1>It's also the most widely spoken African</v>
<v Speaker 1>language outside of Africa,</v>

25
00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.150
<v Speaker 1>spoken by migrants around the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's excluding Arabic,</v>

26
00:01:56.151 --> 00:01:58.550
<v Speaker 1>which is not considered a native </v>
<v Speaker 1>language of Africa.</v>

27
00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.730
<v Speaker 1>You'll robot is primarily the language </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the Yoruba people,</v>

28
00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.640
<v Speaker 1>but not all Yoruba people speak the euro</v>
<v Speaker 1>by language.</v>

29
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.140
<v Speaker 1>Yoruba is a tonal language and each </v>
<v Speaker 1>syllable has one of three tones,</v>

30
00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:09.921
<v Speaker 1>high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mid,</v>

31
00:02:09.921 --> 00:02:11.960
<v Speaker 1>or low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as I understand it,</v>

32
00:02:11.961 --> 00:02:14.570
<v Speaker 1>you can hear these three tones in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>name of the language,</v>

33
00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.410
<v Speaker 1>which is pronounced Yoda with a mid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>low and high tone.</v>

34
00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.630
<v Speaker 1>I probably just slaughtered that </v>
<v Speaker 1>pronunciation,</v>

35
00:02:20.631 --> 00:02:22.700
<v Speaker 1>but you get the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are three tones.</v>

36
00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.350
<v Speaker 1>Another feature to notice is that Yoruba</v>
<v Speaker 1>syllables consist of a vowel,</v>

37
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.393
<v Speaker 1>a consonant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>followed by a vowel or a nasal sound </v>

38
00:02:30.621 --> 00:02:34.130
<v Speaker 1>that functions as its own syllable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are no consonant clusters,</v>

39
00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.710
<v Speaker 1>and in that regard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's similar to Japanese.</v>

40
00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.840
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's look at another language.</v>

41
00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:39.763
<v Speaker 1>Please listen.</v>

42
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.380
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] oh this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

43
00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:47.253
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] [inaudible] know sending it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You go tubing in a Nigga Ya Kay up in </v>

44
00:02:53.541 --> 00:02:55.740
<v Speaker 3>the head on the hen to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

45
00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:56.721
<v Speaker 3>and the Doh Doh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doh,</v>

46
00:02:56.721 --> 00:02:57.554
<v Speaker 3>Doh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doh,</v>

47
00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.950
<v Speaker 3>Doh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just your don't need [inaudible] hillel.</v>

48
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.170
<v Speaker 3>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh no,</v>

49
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.080
<v Speaker 3>because if we just say it's a buy </v>
<v Speaker 3>nowadays.</v>

50
00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.210
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>

51
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:18.210
<v Speaker 1>Now let's see a written sample of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>language now.</v>

52
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.660
<v Speaker 1>What language do you think it is?</v>

53
00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.143
<v Speaker 1>The language is Navajo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Navajo is a member of the southern </v>

54
00:03:42.361 --> 00:03:44.520
<v Speaker 1>branch of the Athabaskan language </v>
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>

55
00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:45.533
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the most widely spoken </v>
<v Speaker 1>native American languages with around </v>

56
00:03:48.331 --> 00:03:50.490
<v Speaker 1>170,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>native speakers,</v>

57
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.040
<v Speaker 1>most of whom are bilingual and speak </v>
<v Speaker 1>English as well.</v>

58
00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.820
<v Speaker 1>The area where Navajo is spoken is in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the southwestern United States,</v>

59
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.020
<v Speaker 1>principally in Arizona,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also across the state borders in New</v>

60
00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.853
<v Speaker 1>Mexico and Utah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Navajo is a tonal language with four </v>

61
00:04:03.991 --> 00:04:06.780
<v Speaker 1>tones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hi Lo rising and falling.</v>

62
00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.300
<v Speaker 1>It has a large inventory of consonant </v>
<v Speaker 1>sounds.</v>

63
00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:10.223
<v Speaker 1>One example is a distinction between </v>
<v Speaker 1>plan stops and fricatives and labial </v>

64
00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.570
<v Speaker 1>stops and fricking tips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

65
00:04:15.571 --> 00:04:18.170
<v Speaker 1>there's the plane stop cut and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the labor.</v>

66
00:04:18.171 --> 00:04:21.450
<v Speaker 1>You'll stop quit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The difference is that the labial sounds</v>

67
00:04:21.451 --> 00:04:26.451
<v Speaker 1>include the rounding of the lips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another example is and whoa and end,</v>

68
00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:28.613
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these two sounds are sounds not used in </v>

69
00:04:31.891 --> 00:04:32.724
<v Speaker 1>English,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we have the labial sounds as </v>

70
00:04:34.081 --> 00:04:34.914
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are just a few of the many sounds </v>

71
00:04:36.511 --> 00:04:37.530
<v Speaker 1>of Navajo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

72
00:04:37.531 --> 00:04:39.000
<v Speaker 1>Time for the next language.</v>

73
00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:40.503
<v Speaker 4>What am I knew?</v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] [inaudible] </v>

74
00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:47.803
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] have</v>
<v Speaker 4>to get on with summary or moving them </v>

75
00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:57.663
<v Speaker 4>cause some symptoms or what they want to</v>
<v Speaker 4>put you on [inaudible] because we put </v>

76
00:05:01.341 --> 00:05:04.270
<v Speaker 4>down and sort of new car or domain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How last point you had to show my money,</v>

77
00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.780
<v Speaker 4>so he stood up to him and I've got a </v>
<v Speaker 4>steak or something.</v>

78
00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:09.680
<v Speaker 4>I'd or quartermaine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

79
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.940
<v Speaker 1>Now let's see a written sample.</v>

80
00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:20.633
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

81
00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.730
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What language do you think it is?</v>

82
00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.490
<v Speaker 1>It's the Hungarian language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hungarian is spoken by around 15 million</v>

83
00:05:33.491 --> 00:05:35.260
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of them in Hungary,</v>

84
00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:36.123
<v Speaker 1>in central Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some live in neighboring Romania as </v>

85
00:05:38.741 --> 00:05:41.110
<v Speaker 1>well as other nearby countries like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Slovakia,</v>

86
00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:42.790
<v Speaker 1>Slovenia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Austria,</v>

87
00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:44.140
<v Speaker 1>Serbia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Croatia,</v>

88
00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:45.003
<v Speaker 1>and Ukraine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hungarian is not an Indo European </v>

89
00:05:47.981 --> 00:05:48.814
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a member of the eugric branch of </v>

90
00:05:50.351 --> 00:05:54.040
<v Speaker 1>the erotic language family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One notable feature of Hungarian is that</v>

91
00:05:54.041 --> 00:05:56.880
<v Speaker 1>there are lots of germinated consonants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>germinated,</v>

92
00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.110
<v Speaker 1>meaning long consonants that are held </v>
<v Speaker 1>longer than a short consonant.</v>

93
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.950
<v Speaker 1>These are represented in writing by </v>
<v Speaker 1>double letters in the audio sample.</v>

94
00:06:03.951 --> 00:06:04.784
<v Speaker 1>You can hear this if you pay attention </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a little pauses when the consonants </v>

95
00:06:07.431 --> 00:06:08.264
<v Speaker 1>are linkedin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another notable feature is palatalized </v>

96
00:06:10.581 --> 00:06:14.220
<v Speaker 1>consonants such as Chia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

97
00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:16.853
<v Speaker 1>and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and overly simple way of describing </v>

98
00:06:20.371 --> 00:06:21.204
<v Speaker 1>these sounds is to say that they sounded</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the consonant followed by a year </v>

99
00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.840
<v Speaker 1>sound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope you liked this episode of mystery</v>
