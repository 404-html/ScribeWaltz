00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:01.803
<v Speaker 1>Ooh.</v>

2
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:03.133
<v Speaker 2>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and </v>

3
00:00:04.791 --> 00:00:05.624
<v Speaker 2>my name is Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Today I'm going to be remaking a video </v>

4
00:00:08.031 --> 00:00:08.864
<v Speaker 2>that I made back in the early days of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this channel because well a lot of the </v>

5
00:00:11.691 --> 00:00:12.524
<v Speaker 2>data in that video is wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The topic is the 10 most widely spoken </v>

6
00:00:16.701 --> 00:00:19.610
<v Speaker 2>languages in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can measure the number of speakers or</v>

7
00:00:19.611 --> 00:00:20.444
<v Speaker 2>language has by looking either at native</v>
<v Speaker 2>speakers or by looking at the total </v>

8
00:00:23.271 --> 00:00:25.670
<v Speaker 2>number of speakers including second </v>
<v Speaker 2>language speakers.</v>

9
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:26.743
<v Speaker 2>First we'll look at the number of native</v>
<v Speaker 2>speakers for each language and later on </v>

10
00:00:29.421 --> 00:00:30.254
<v Speaker 2>we'll include second language speakers </v>
<v Speaker 2>and see how the numbers change based on </v>

11
00:00:32.931 --> 00:00:33.764
<v Speaker 2>the number of native speakers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The most widely spoken language in the </v>

12
00:00:35.841 --> 00:00:40.190
<v Speaker 2>world is Mandarin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has somewhere between 900,000,950</v>

13
00:00:40.191 --> 00:00:41.024
<v Speaker 2>5 million native speakers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That makes it the most widely spoken </v>

14
00:00:43.791 --> 00:00:45.980
<v Speaker 2>native language in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By far,</v>

15
00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.023
<v Speaker 2>mandarin is the most widely spoken of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Chinese languages and it's the </v>

16
00:00:49.491 --> 00:00:51.860
<v Speaker 2>official language of China and Taiwan.</v>

17
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.880
<v Speaker 2>The number of native speakers does not </v>
<v Speaker 2>include native speakers of other Chinese</v>

18
00:00:55.881 --> 00:00:57.350
<v Speaker 2>languages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>only have Mandarin.</v>

19
00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:58.393
<v Speaker 2>Number two is Spanish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>With somewhere between 405 million and </v>

20
00:01:01.371 --> 00:01:05.390
<v Speaker 2>470 million native speakers depending on</v>
<v Speaker 2>which source you consult.</v>

21
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.433
<v Speaker 2>Number two used to be English,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the number of native Spanish </v>

22
00:01:08.751 --> 00:01:09.584
<v Speaker 2>speakers has been growing much more </v>
<v Speaker 2>quickly than the number of native </v>

23
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.380
<v Speaker 2>English speakers in recent years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that brings us to number three which</v>

24
00:01:15.381 --> 00:01:18.680
<v Speaker 2>is English with around 360 million </v>
<v Speaker 2>native speakers.</v>

25
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.220
<v Speaker 2>And an interesting side note on my </v>
<v Speaker 2>previous version of this video,</v>

26
00:01:22.221 --> 00:01:23.054
<v Speaker 2>I got a lot of comments saying there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>no way that the number is that low </v>

27
00:01:25.641 --> 00:01:29.630
<v Speaker 2>because the population of the United </v>
<v Speaker 2>States alone is about 320 million.</v>

28
00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.780
<v Speaker 2>Well keep in mind that a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the United States,</v>

29
00:01:32.781 --> 00:01:33.614
<v Speaker 2>a very large percentage of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>population are actually immigrants who </v>

30
00:01:35.811 --> 00:01:37.850
<v Speaker 2>do not speak English as their first </v>
<v Speaker 2>language.</v>

31
00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.060
<v Speaker 2>And that's also true of other countries </v>
<v Speaker 2>where English is the main language.</v>

32
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.953
<v Speaker 2>Number four is Hindu standing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning Hindi and Urdu with around 355 </v>

33
00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:46.783
<v Speaker 2>million native speakers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hindi and Urdu are spoken in the Indian </v>

34
00:01:49.041 --> 00:01:49.874
<v Speaker 2>subcontinent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in India and Pakistan and they are very </v>

35
00:01:52.101 --> 00:01:52.934
<v Speaker 2>similar in their spoken forms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they can be considered one language </v>

36
00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.190
<v Speaker 2>even though they're literary forms are </v>
<v Speaker 2>quite different.</v>

37
00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.820
<v Speaker 2>For more information on Hindustan each </v>
<v Speaker 2>check out my video on that subject right</v>

38
00:02:01.821 --> 00:02:02.654
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Number five as Arabic with around 293 </v>

39
00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:07.183
<v Speaker 2>million native speakers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I should note that Arabic has many </v>

40
00:02:09.591 --> 00:02:12.830
<v Speaker 2>different spoken varieties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many different dialects and some of them</v>

41
00:02:12.831 --> 00:02:16.400
<v Speaker 2>are harder to understand than others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of them are kind of unintelligible.</v>

42
00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.050
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Moroccan Arabic,</v>

43
00:02:18.051 --> 00:02:18.884
<v Speaker 2>lots of people from other Arabic </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries say it's hard to understand </v>

44
00:02:21.171 --> 00:02:22.004
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Arabic does have a standard </v>

45
00:02:23.601 --> 00:02:24.434
<v Speaker 2>language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Standard Arabic unites all of the </v>

46
00:02:25.731 --> 00:02:26.564
<v Speaker 2>different dialects and people can use it</v>
<v Speaker 2>to communicate with speakers of the </v>

47
00:02:29.451 --> 00:02:30.284
<v Speaker 2>other dialects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So even though some of those dialects </v>

48
00:02:31.881 --> 00:02:32.714
<v Speaker 2>are fairly different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can be considered one language and </v>

49
00:02:34.641 --> 00:02:39.410
<v Speaker 2>if we include all varieties of Arabic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are 293 million native speakers.</v>

50
00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.390
<v Speaker 2>Number six is Portuguese was somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 2>between 215,000,220</v>

51
00:02:44.391 --> 00:02:45.224
<v Speaker 2>5 million native speakers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people are surprised to hear </v>

52
00:02:47.541 --> 00:02:48.374
<v Speaker 2>that Portuguese is on this list,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but remember Portuguese is not only the </v>

53
00:02:51.021 --> 00:02:53.960
<v Speaker 2>language of Portugal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also spoken in Brazil,</v>

54
00:02:53.961 --> 00:02:54.794
<v Speaker 2>which has a population of 200 million.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Number seven is Bengali with around 206 </v>

55
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.273
<v Speaker 2>native speakers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mostly living in Bangladesh and in some </v>

56
00:03:02.411 --> 00:03:03.244
<v Speaker 2>of the eastern provinces of India.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Number eight is Russian with around 155 </v>

57
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:08.373
<v Speaker 2>million native speakers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Number nine is Japanese with around 126 </v>

58
00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:12.813
<v Speaker 2>million native speakers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Number 10 is Punjabi with around 102 </v>

59
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.510
<v Speaker 2>million native speakers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is spoken mainly in western India and</v>

60
00:03:19.511 --> 00:03:20.830
<v Speaker 2>in Pakistan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

61
00:03:20.831 --> 00:03:21.664
<v Speaker 2>it's the most widely spoken native </v>
<v Speaker 2>language in Pakistan even though it's </v>

62
00:03:23.981 --> 00:03:27.220
<v Speaker 2>not the official language there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those were the top 10 languages based on</v>

63
00:03:27.221 --> 00:03:28.054
<v Speaker 2>the number of native speakers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the situation is somewhat different </v>

64
00:03:30.581 --> 00:03:31.414
<v Speaker 2>if we include second language speakers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's because some languages are much </v>

65
00:03:34.271 --> 00:03:38.050
<v Speaker 2>more widely spoken as a Lingua Franca </v>
<v Speaker 2>than they are as a native language.</v>

66
00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.590
<v Speaker 2>So let's see what the list looks like if</v>
<v Speaker 2>we include non native speakers.</v>

67
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:42.483
<v Speaker 2>Number one is English.</v>
<v Speaker 2>English has a lot fewer native speakers </v>

68
00:03:44.981 --> 00:03:45.814
<v Speaker 2>than Mandarin Chinese does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if we include all the people around </v>

69
00:03:48.011 --> 00:03:48.844
<v Speaker 2>the world who learned English as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>second language or as a foreign </v>

70
00:03:50.741 --> 00:03:53.800
<v Speaker 2>language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that brings the numbers up to around 1.4</v>

71
00:03:53.801 --> 00:03:55.900
<v Speaker 2>to 1.5</v>
<v Speaker 2>billion speakers.</v>

72
00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:58.930
<v Speaker 2>Some people estimate the number to be as</v>
<v Speaker 2>high as 2 billion,</v>

73
00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.823
<v Speaker 2>but of course there is some disagreement</v>
<v Speaker 2>about what level of proficiency is </v>

74
00:04:02.471 --> 00:04:05.500
<v Speaker 2>necessary in order to be included as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>speaker of English.</v>

75
00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.290
<v Speaker 2>English is the defacto Global Lingua </v>
<v Speaker 2>Franca,</v>

76
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.240
<v Speaker 2>the international language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>

77
00:04:10.241 --> 00:04:11.074
<v Speaker 2>Esperanto lovers number two is mandarin </v>
<v Speaker 2>with somewhere between one point </v>

78
00:04:14.411 --> 00:04:17.170
<v Speaker 2>1000000001.1</v>
<v Speaker 2>5 billion speakers.</v>

79
00:04:17.171 --> 00:04:21.280
<v Speaker 2>If we include the 119 million people who</v>
<v Speaker 2>have learned it as a second language,</v>

80
00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:22.263
<v Speaker 2>those people are mostly in China and </v>
<v Speaker 2>mostly speakers of other Chinese </v>

81
00:04:24.881 --> 00:04:25.714
<v Speaker 2>languages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Number three is Spanish with somewhere </v>

82
00:04:28.331 --> 00:04:29.640
<v Speaker 2>between 500 million.</v>

83
00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:30.473
<v Speaker 2>That 570 million speakers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are about 90 million people who </v>

84
00:04:33.551 --> 00:04:34.384
<v Speaker 2>speak Spanish as a second language </v>
<v Speaker 2>including linguistic minorities and a </v>

85
00:04:37.121 --> 00:04:37.954
<v Speaker 2>lot of Spanish speaking countries and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there are also a lot of people who </v>

86
00:04:40.121 --> 00:04:40.954
<v Speaker 2>learned Spanish as a foreign language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Number four is Hindu standing with </v>

87
00:04:43.561 --> 00:04:44.394
<v Speaker 2>around 514 million speakers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That means that there are about </v>

88
00:04:47.381 --> 00:04:52.381
<v Speaker 2>200000002nd language speakers of him </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding Hindi and Urdu function as</v>

89
00:04:52.481 --> 00:04:53.314
<v Speaker 2>Lingua Franca is in much of northern </v>
<v Speaker 2>India and in Pakistan in Pakistan for </v>

90
00:04:56.561 --> 00:05:00.670
<v Speaker 2>example or do a spoken as a second </v>
<v Speaker 2>language by around 94 million people and</v>

91
00:05:00.671 --> 00:05:03.970
<v Speaker 2>it's only the native language of around </v>
<v Speaker 2>9% of the population.</v>

92
00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.080
<v Speaker 2>Number five was Arabic with around 422 </v>
<v Speaker 2>million speakers.</v>

93
00:05:08.081 --> 00:05:12.490
<v Speaker 2>That means that there are around </v>
<v Speaker 2>130000002nd language speakers of Arabic.</v>

94
00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:13.533
<v Speaker 2>A lot of these people are non Arabs </v>
<v Speaker 2>living in countries where Arabic is an </v>

95
00:05:16.121 --> 00:05:17.470
<v Speaker 2>official language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

96
00:05:17.471 --> 00:05:19.960
<v Speaker 2>many speakers of the Berber language is </v>
<v Speaker 2>in North Africa.</v>

97
00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:21.670
<v Speaker 2>Learn Arabic as a second language.</v>

98
00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:22.533
<v Speaker 2>Varieties of Arabic are also used as </v>
<v Speaker 2>Lingua Franca us throughout different </v>

99
00:05:25.151 --> 00:05:25.984
<v Speaker 2>parts of Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Number six is a Russian with around 260 </v>

100
00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:29.973
<v Speaker 2>million speakers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Russian jumped from number eight on the </v>

101
00:05:31.661 --> 00:05:32.494
<v Speaker 2>first list to number six on this list.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's because Russian is widely spoken </v>

102
00:05:35.321 --> 00:05:38.290
<v Speaker 2>as a Lingua Franca throughout much of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the former Soviet Union.</v>

103
00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:41.590
<v Speaker 2>For more information on Russian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>check out my video on that subject right</v>

104
00:05:41.591 --> 00:05:42.424
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Number seven is Portuguese with between </v>

105
00:05:45.191 --> 00:05:46.024
<v Speaker 2>250 million and 260 million speakers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are about 35000002nd language </v>

106
00:05:50.921 --> 00:05:51.754
<v Speaker 2>speakers of Portuguese,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mainly in African countries like Angola </v>

107
00:05:54.401 --> 00:05:55.234
<v Speaker 2>and Mozambique countries where </v>
<v Speaker 2>Portuguese is the former colonial </v>

108
00:05:57.411 --> 00:05:58.244
<v Speaker 2>language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Today there are some native speakers </v>

109
00:05:59.331 --> 00:06:00.164
<v Speaker 2>living in those countries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Portuguese is also used as a Lingua </v>

110
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:04.640
<v Speaker 2>Franca between the diverse linguistic </v>
<v Speaker 2>communities.</v>

111
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:05.623
<v Speaker 2>Number eight is a language that didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>even appear on our original top 10 list </v>

112
00:06:08.661 --> 00:06:11.390
<v Speaker 2>and that is the Malay language including</v>
<v Speaker 2>Indonesia,</v>

113
00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:12.830
<v Speaker 2>which is a variety of Malai.</v>

114
00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:13.843
<v Speaker 2>It is spoken by around 77 million people</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a native language and there are an </v>

115
00:06:17.031 --> 00:06:17.864
<v Speaker 2>additional 173000002nd language speakers</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a total of 250 million speakers of </v>

116
00:06:23.601 --> 00:06:26.690
<v Speaker 2>Malaysia and Indonesia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the reasons that it has spoken so</v>

117
00:06:26.691 --> 00:06:30.650
<v Speaker 2>much more widely as a second language is</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it is widely learned as a second</v>

118
00:06:30.651 --> 00:06:33.350
<v Speaker 2>language in Indonesia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There it is the official language,</v>

119
00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:34.184
<v Speaker 2>but it's mainly used as a lingua franca </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there are hundreds of languages </v>

120
00:06:36.801 --> 00:06:37.634
<v Speaker 2>spoken in Indonesia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Number nine is Bengali with around 226 </v>

121
00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:41.683
<v Speaker 2>million speakers and number 10 is French</v>
<v Speaker 2>or another language that didn't appear </v>

122
00:06:44.181 --> 00:06:45.014
<v Speaker 2>on our original top 10 list.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While French has around 80 million </v>

123
00:06:47.421 --> 00:06:48.254
<v Speaker 2>native speakers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are around 140 million second </v>

124
00:06:50.331 --> 00:06:53.420
<v Speaker 2>language speakers for a total of about </v>
<v Speaker 2>220 million.</v>

125
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:56.810
<v Speaker 2>The majority of those speakers are in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Africa where French is spoken and around</v>

126
00:06:56.811 --> 00:06:57.644
<v Speaker 2>31 different countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some researchers project that the </v>

127
00:06:59.781 --> 00:07:00.614
<v Speaker 2>Francophone population will be as high </v>
<v Speaker 2>as 500 million in the year 2025 and 700 </v>

128
00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:09.200
<v Speaker 2>million in the year 2050 so which list </v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think is more meaningful?</v>

129
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:12.980
<v Speaker 2>I tend to think that the second list is </v>
<v Speaker 2>more meaningful because in my opinion,</v>

130
00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:17.090
<v Speaker 2>the importance of a language depends on </v>
<v Speaker 2>how many people use it for communication</v>

131
00:07:17.091 --> 00:07:17.924
<v Speaker 2>and not on how many people speak it </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfectly and with the perfect native </v>

132
00:07:20.361 --> 00:07:21.194
<v Speaker 2>accent and I think that another thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes a language important is how </v>

133
00:07:23.931 --> 00:07:25.850
<v Speaker 2>many countries that is spoken in </v>
<v Speaker 2>andover,</v>

134
00:07:25.851 --> 00:07:28.160
<v Speaker 2>how wide of a geographic area that has </v>
<v Speaker 2>spoken.</v>

135
00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.233
<v Speaker 2>I think we have to balance these two </v>
<v Speaker 2>different factors in order to determine </v>

136
00:07:31.611 --> 00:07:32.444
<v Speaker 2>how important the language is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So even though Mandarin has the largest </v>

137
00:07:35.001 --> 00:07:35.834
<v Speaker 2>number of native speakers and even </v>
<v Speaker 2>though it has the second largest number </v>

138
00:07:38.121 --> 00:07:38.954
<v Speaker 2>of total speakers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might not be the most important or </v>

139
00:07:41.271 --> 00:07:43.190
<v Speaker 2>second most important language in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

140
00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:44.233
<v Speaker 2>The most important language in the world</v>
<v Speaker 2>is right now clearly English because it </v>

141
00:07:47.121 --> 00:07:49.640
<v Speaker 2>is widely spoken by so many people </v>
<v Speaker 2>around the world.</v>

142
00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:50.743
<v Speaker 2>I would say that number two is Spanish </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's spoken by a large </v>

143
00:07:52.941 --> 00:07:56.060
<v Speaker 2>population and it's spoken in dozens of </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries around the world.</v>

144
00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:59.000
<v Speaker 2>And because the Spanish speaking </v>
<v Speaker 2>population is growing quickly,</v>

145
00:07:59.150 --> 00:07:59.983
<v Speaker 2>I would say that French might be another</v>
<v Speaker 2>one in the top five because of it's </v>

146
00:08:02.301 --> 00:08:06.200
<v Speaker 2>fairly large total number of speakers </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's widely spoken in Europe and</v>

147
00:08:06.201 --> 00:08:07.034
<v Speaker 2>in Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And because of the projected growth in </v>

148
00:08:08.541 --> 00:08:09.374
<v Speaker 2>the francophone population,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another might be Arabic because it's </v>

149
00:08:11.661 --> 00:08:12.494
<v Speaker 2>spoken throughout many countries in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Middle East and North Africa and by a </v>

150
00:08:14.991 --> 00:08:17.390
<v Speaker 2>growing population in Europe and around </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

151
00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:18.373
<v Speaker 2>And another one is probably Chinese,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though it's not an official </v>

152
00:08:20.631 --> 00:08:21.464
<v Speaker 2>language in many places,</v>
<v Speaker 2>China is an important country with a </v>

153
00:08:23.751 --> 00:08:24.584
<v Speaker 2>huge population and a large economy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Chinese might become more important in </v>

154
00:08:28.011 --> 00:08:29.900
<v Speaker 2>the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the question of the day is,</v>

155
00:08:29.901 --> 00:08:32.480
<v Speaker 2>what do you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are the most important languages in</v>

156
00:08:32.481 --> 00:08:33.314
<v Speaker 2>the world?</v>
