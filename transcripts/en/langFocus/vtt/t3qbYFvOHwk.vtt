00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.420
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel at.</v>

2
00:00:03.421 --> 00:00:07.380
<v Speaker 1>My name is Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today's topic is language death.</v>

3
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.200
<v Speaker 1>Normally on this channel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I talk about a language,</v>

4
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.063
<v Speaker 1>it's usually a living language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a language that still spoken by native </v>

5
00:00:13.921 --> 00:00:17.070
<v Speaker 1>speakers today and continues to grow and</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolve,</v>

6
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.760
<v Speaker 1>but there are also dead languages and </v>
<v Speaker 1>extinct languages.</v>

7
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.840
<v Speaker 1>Languages are considered dead when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>simply have no more native speakers,</v>

8
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.510
<v Speaker 1>even though they may continue to be used</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some way.</v>

9
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.490
<v Speaker 1>Latin is dead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

10
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:30.353
<v Speaker 1>but it continues to be used for </v>
<v Speaker 1>religious purposes and for some </v>

11
00:00:32.581 --> 00:00:33.414
<v Speaker 1>administrative purposes in the Vatican.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people can speak it but not </v>

12
00:00:37.531 --> 00:00:38.364
<v Speaker 1>naturally like a native language and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not passed down as a native </v>

13
00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:43.470
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another example is Hebrew,</v>

14
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.550
<v Speaker 1>which was a dead language before its </v>
<v Speaker 1>revival in the form of modern Hebrew.</v>

15
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.310
<v Speaker 1>Nobody spoke it natively for a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

16
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.173
<v Speaker 1>but it continued to be used for </v>
<v Speaker 1>religious purposes and as a written </v>

17
00:00:53.881 --> 00:00:54.990
<v Speaker 1>literary language.</v>

18
00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.500
<v Speaker 1>In contrast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>languages are considered extinct when no</v>

19
00:00:58.501 --> 00:01:01.020
<v Speaker 1>living person can speak them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

20
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.190
<v Speaker 1>if the last remaining speaker of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>native American language dies and nobody</v>

21
00:01:05.191 --> 00:01:08.850
<v Speaker 1>has learned it as a second language than</v>
<v Speaker 1>that language becomes extinct.</v>

22
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.893
<v Speaker 1>Likewise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ancient languages like Sumerian are </v>

23
00:01:11.791 --> 00:01:12.624
<v Speaker 1>extinct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people might be able to read </v>

24
00:01:14.131 --> 00:01:17.430
<v Speaker 1>ancient texts in that language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nobody really uses it today.</v>

25
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.450
<v Speaker 1>Languages become either dead or extinct </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a result of language,</v>

26
00:01:21.451 --> 00:01:23.940
<v Speaker 1>death types of language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Death.</v>

27
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.730
<v Speaker 1>Languages don't always die in the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

28
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.830
<v Speaker 1>There are various types of language </v>
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>

29
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.993
<v Speaker 1>The most common way that languages </v>
<v Speaker 1>disappear is through gradual language </v>

30
00:01:32.791 --> 00:01:35.190
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This normally happens when speakers have</v>

31
00:01:35.191 --> 00:01:39.000
<v Speaker 1>one language come into contact with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>language of higher prestige,</v>

32
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.820
<v Speaker 1>the language of a dominant more powerful</v>
<v Speaker 1>group of people.</v>

33
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.030
<v Speaker 1>That community may remain bilingual for </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite a long time,</v>

34
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.893
<v Speaker 1>but with each successive generation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fewer young people speak their </v>

35
00:01:48.331 --> 00:01:52.680
<v Speaker 1>traditional language and with lower </v>
<v Speaker 1>levels of proficiency as they opt to use</v>

36
00:01:52.681 --> 00:01:56.160
<v Speaker 1>the prestige language instead until one </v>
<v Speaker 1>day their communities.</v>

37
00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.200
<v Speaker 1>Traditional language is no longer </v>
<v Speaker 1>spoken.</v>

38
00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.213
<v Speaker 1>An example of this as corniche,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which seems to be spoken by the late </v>

39
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:02.573
<v Speaker 1>19th century as a result of the growing </v>
<v Speaker 1>influence of English and also as a </v>

40
00:02:06.241 --> 00:02:09.420
<v Speaker 1>result of the perception of Cornish as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lower class language,</v>

41
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:11.400
<v Speaker 1>even amongst it's own speakers at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

42
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.170
<v Speaker 1>but cornish is actually not extinct </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there are revitalization efforts</v>

43
00:02:16.171 --> 00:02:17.004
<v Speaker 1>to encourage people to continue to use </v>
<v Speaker 1>that language next bottom to top </v>

44
00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.370
<v Speaker 1>language death in bottom to top language</v>
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>

45
00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.580
<v Speaker 1>A language ceases to be used as a native</v>
<v Speaker 1>spoken language,</v>

46
00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.430
<v Speaker 1>but continues to be used in certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>contexts.</v>

47
00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:30.323
<v Speaker 1>Normally in a formal religious context </v>
<v Speaker 1>or ceremonial context or perhaps for </v>

48
00:02:34.081 --> 00:02:37.410
<v Speaker 1>literary purposes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In gradual language death,</v>

49
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.790
<v Speaker 1>the language normally disappears first </v>
<v Speaker 1>in more formal contexts as it's replaced</v>

50
00:02:41.791 --> 00:02:42.624
<v Speaker 1>by the prestige language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it continues to be spoken in more </v>

51
00:02:44.971 --> 00:02:49.140
<v Speaker 1>casual contexts for a longer time in </v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom to top language deaths.</v>

52
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.750
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the language dies out at the bottom,</v>

53
00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.850
<v Speaker 1>in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in casual contexts,</v>

54
00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.700
<v Speaker 1>but it continues to be used in more </v>
<v Speaker 1>formal contexts.</v>

55
00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:58.433
<v Speaker 1>An example of this is Latin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is basically no longer used </v>

56
00:03:00.761 --> 00:03:05.080
<v Speaker 1>outside of religious ceremonial contexts</v>
<v Speaker 1>or perhaps literary contexts.</v>

57
00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:07.750
<v Speaker 1>Next,</v>
<v Speaker 1>southern language death.</v>

58
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.370
<v Speaker 1>Southern language death occurs when all </v>
<v Speaker 1>or almost all the speakers of a language</v>

59
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.820
<v Speaker 1>suddenly die as a result of a disaster </v>
<v Speaker 1>or violence.</v>

60
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.073
<v Speaker 1>An example of this took place in the 18 </v>
<v Speaker 1>thirties in Tasmania when virtually all </v>

61
00:03:20.531 --> 00:03:21.364
<v Speaker 1>of the islands native inhabitants were </v>
<v Speaker 1>wiped out by European colonists during </v>

62
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.580
<v Speaker 1>the black war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Next,</v>

63
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.270
<v Speaker 1>radical language death similar to </v>
<v Speaker 1>southern language death,</v>

64
00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:32.223
<v Speaker 1>radical language death normally happens </v>
<v Speaker 1>very rapidly and normally happens as a </v>

65
00:03:35.711 --> 00:03:38.950
<v Speaker 1>result of political repression or under </v>
<v Speaker 1>threat of violence.</v>

66
00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.550
<v Speaker 1>The difference is that the language has </v>
<v Speaker 1>speakers are not wiped out,</v>

67
00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.660
<v Speaker 1>but suddenly stop using their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>language as a way to avoid persecution.</v>

68
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:47.613
<v Speaker 1>And example of this occurred in El </v>
<v Speaker 1>Salvador during an uprising in the 19 </v>

69
00:03:50.741 --> 00:03:51.574
<v Speaker 1>thirties when many aboriginals abruptly </v>
<v Speaker 1>stopped speaking their native languages </v>

70
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.833
<v Speaker 1>as a way to avoid being identified as </v>
<v Speaker 1>aboriginals and potentially killed two </v>

71
00:04:00.161 --> 00:04:05.161
<v Speaker 1>languages that suddenly died out where </v>
<v Speaker 1>Linka and case studies.</v>

72
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.083
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at a few languages that have </v>
<v Speaker 1>already died and see if we could figure </v>

73
00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:10.624
<v Speaker 1>out how they ceased to be spoken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Old Church slavonic old church slavonic </v>

74
00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.460
<v Speaker 1>is the first the tested Slavic language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was spoken and written between the</v>

75
00:04:18.461 --> 00:04:19.294
<v Speaker 1>ninth and 11th centuries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a standardized variety of Slavic </v>

76
00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.200
<v Speaker 1>that was understood by speakers of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>various Slavic dialects of that time,</v>

77
00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.360
<v Speaker 1>which were still quite similar to each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>

78
00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.810
<v Speaker 1>those slavic dialects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which were basically the colloquial form</v>

79
00:04:31.811 --> 00:04:32.644
<v Speaker 1>of the same language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gradually developed into the different </v>

80
00:04:34.661 --> 00:04:35.494
<v Speaker 1>Slavic languages of today because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>still used in some churches for </v>

81
00:04:39.011 --> 00:04:41.860
<v Speaker 1>religious purposes today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a liturgical language,</v>

82
00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.850
<v Speaker 1>so it fits in with the category of </v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom to top language death.</v>

83
00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:47.043
<v Speaker 1>The newly developing Slavic languages </v>
<v Speaker 1>replaced the old slavonic dialects as </v>

84
00:04:50.441 --> 00:04:51.274
<v Speaker 1>the languages of daily life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but old church slavonic continued to be </v>

85
00:04:53.891 --> 00:04:54.724
<v Speaker 1>used for religious purposes and for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain amount of time for political </v>

86
00:04:57.941 --> 00:04:58.774
<v Speaker 1>purposes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's worth noting that some dead </v>

87
00:05:00.791 --> 00:05:05.230
<v Speaker 1>languages never actually died in both </v>
<v Speaker 1>the case of Latin and of old slavonic.</v>

88
00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:06.123
<v Speaker 1>The language never stopped being spoken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just continued to evolve into </v>

89
00:05:09.011 --> 00:05:09.844
<v Speaker 1>different languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leaving the cotified literary language </v>

90
00:05:12.041 --> 00:05:15.310
<v Speaker 1>behind as a separate dead language that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was no longer spoken,</v>

91
00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:20.760
<v Speaker 1>the men then language in 2016,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a man named Edwin Benson,</v>

92
00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.160
<v Speaker 1>the last remaining speaker of the men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then language passed away.</v>

93
00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:25.203
<v Speaker 1>Men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dan was a native American language of </v>

94
00:05:26.471 --> 00:05:27.304
<v Speaker 1>the Sewan language family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was spoken in the state of North </v>

95
00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.600
<v Speaker 1>Dakota.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The population of men,</v>

96
00:05:31.601 --> 00:05:32.434
<v Speaker 1>Dan speakers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was nearly wiped out by an outbreak of </v>

97
00:05:34.451 --> 00:05:38.020
<v Speaker 1>smallpox in the seventies and eighties </v>
<v Speaker 1>and again in the 18 thirties.</v>

98
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:42.700
<v Speaker 1>The cohesion of the remaining population</v>
<v Speaker 1>was limited by government relocation and</v>

99
00:05:42.701 --> 00:05:46.060
<v Speaker 1>the construction of dams which separated</v>
<v Speaker 1>villages from each other.</v>

100
00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.170
<v Speaker 1>While the influence of English group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that most of the population was</v>

101
00:05:50.171 --> 00:05:51.004
<v Speaker 1>wiped out in tragic outbreaks of </v>
<v Speaker 1>smallpox would place this in the </v>

102
00:05:53.801 --> 00:05:54.634
<v Speaker 1>category of southern language death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though some speakers of the </v>

103
00:05:57.231 --> 00:06:00.440
<v Speaker 1>language continued to live on among the </v>
<v Speaker 1>remaining speakers,</v>

104
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.860
<v Speaker 1>we can also say that there was an </v>
<v Speaker 1>element of gradual language death.</v>

105
00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:04.783
<v Speaker 1>As more and more members of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>community began to speak the prestige </v>

106
00:06:07.191 --> 00:06:08.024
<v Speaker 1>language English until one day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>men then was no longer spoken ghoulish </v>

107
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:12.763
<v Speaker 1>up until the sixth century seat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A Celtic language called galesh was </v>

108
00:06:15.861 --> 00:06:19.280
<v Speaker 1>spoken in what's now France when the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Romans conquered the area,</v>

109
00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:20.203
<v Speaker 1>they made Latin the official language of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the state and being able to speak Latin </v>

110
00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:28.010
<v Speaker 1>became a way to gain status and economic</v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity for a number of centuries.</v>

111
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.903
<v Speaker 1>It was common to be bilingual and golish</v>
<v Speaker 1>vernacular and the prestige language </v>

112
00:06:32.031 --> 00:06:35.210
<v Speaker 1>Latin until Latin finally replaced </v>
<v Speaker 1>golish entirely.</v>

113
00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:36.433
<v Speaker 1>This is a clear case of gradual language</v>
<v Speaker 1>death as a population gradually gave up </v>

114
00:06:40.011 --> 00:06:42.980
<v Speaker 1>their traditional language in favor of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the prestige language.</v>

115
00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:47.360
<v Speaker 1>A joa between 19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 and 1940.</v>

116
00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:48.283
<v Speaker 1>The agewell language died out in Nigeria</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's entire community of </v>

117
00:06:51.591 --> 00:06:55.430
<v Speaker 1>speakers switched to house up for </v>
<v Speaker 1>economic and practical reasons.</v>

118
00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:59.540
<v Speaker 1>The entire community very rapidly </v>
<v Speaker 1>stopped using their traditional language</v>

119
00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:02.060
<v Speaker 1>and it was not passed down to the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>generation.</v>

120
00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:03.163
<v Speaker 1>This is an example of radical language </v>
<v Speaker 1>death when a language dies because all </v>

121
00:07:06.591 --> 00:07:09.290
<v Speaker 1>of it speakers suddenly switched to </v>
<v Speaker 1>another language.</v>

122
00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:11.690
<v Speaker 1>In many cases of radical language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>death,</v>

123
00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:15.920
<v Speaker 1>the community gives up their language </v>
<v Speaker 1>for survival in the face of violence,</v>

124
00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:16.813
<v Speaker 1>but in this particular case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they gave up the agewell language </v>

125
00:07:19.101 --> 00:07:22.310
<v Speaker 1>because it was more beneficial for their</v>
<v Speaker 1>community to speak Hausa.</v>

126
00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:27.440
<v Speaker 1>Why should we care about language death?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people think that language death is</v>

127
00:07:27.441 --> 00:07:28.274
<v Speaker 1>a good thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that less language diversity is a good </v>

128
00:07:30.201 --> 00:07:31.250
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

129
00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:32.113
<v Speaker 1>the leaders of some countries want one </v>
<v Speaker 1>language to be dominant and to replace </v>

130
00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:35.954
<v Speaker 1>all of the others because they think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that will promote the unity of their </v>

131
00:07:38.271 --> 00:07:39.830
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>

132
00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:42.740
<v Speaker 1>a language is part of a culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when a language dies,</v>

133
00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.520
<v Speaker 1>part of that culture dies and a unique </v>
<v Speaker 1>way of seeing the world dies with it.</v>

134
00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:47.653
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's look at the endangered color wire </v>

135
00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:50.383
<v Speaker 1>language of Bolivia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Columbia is used by a sect of medicine </v>

136
00:07:53.271 --> 00:07:54.104
<v Speaker 1>men who learned the language not only to</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand the ritual practice and oral </v>

137
00:07:57.591 --> 00:07:58.424
<v Speaker 1>tradition of their ancestors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also to understand the thousands </v>

138
00:08:01.011 --> 00:08:01.844
<v Speaker 1>upon thousands of plant names specific </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the callaway or language that </v>

139
00:08:04.761 --> 00:08:07.940
<v Speaker 1>explained the medicine will uses of </v>
<v Speaker 1>different plants in the local region.</v>

140
00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:09.043
<v Speaker 1>If color disappears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then all of that culture and secret </v>

141
00:08:11.421 --> 00:08:12.254
<v Speaker 1>knowledge will disappear with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Linguistic diversity has been on a </v>

142
00:08:15.921 --> 00:08:18.950
<v Speaker 1>steady decline and of the presence </v>
<v Speaker 1>nearly 7,000</v>

143
00:08:18.951 --> 00:08:19.784
<v Speaker 1>languages on earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nearly half are endangered and the top </v>

144
00:08:23.061 --> 00:08:27.920
<v Speaker 1>100 most spoken languages are spoken by </v>
<v Speaker 1>85 percent of the world's population.</v>

145
00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:32.510
<v Speaker 1>Some endangered languages are finding </v>
<v Speaker 1>new life through revitalization efforts,</v>

146
00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:35.690
<v Speaker 1>which require that the language first be</v>
<v Speaker 1>recorded and documented,</v>

147
00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:36.673
<v Speaker 1>then learned by a new speakers and also </v>
<v Speaker 1>used by an enthusiastic and motivated </v>

148
00:08:40.881 --> 00:08:44.300
<v Speaker 1>community and having some political </v>
<v Speaker 1>influence wouldn't hurt either.</v>

149
00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:47.720
<v Speaker 1>The question of the day in your country </v>
<v Speaker 1>or in your region,</v>

150
00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:51.440
<v Speaker 1>are there languages that are in danger </v>
<v Speaker 1>of dying or becoming extinct?</v>

151
00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:54.050
<v Speaker 1>How would you feel about those languages</v>
<v Speaker 1>disappearing?</v>

152
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:57.380
<v Speaker 1>What's something important be lost?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be sure to follow Lang,</v>

153
00:08:57.381 --> 00:08:58.980
<v Speaker 1>focus on facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter,</v>

154
00:08:58.981 --> 00:09:00.870
<v Speaker 1>and Instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and once again,</v>

155
00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:03.450
<v Speaker 1>thank you to all of my wonderful patrion</v>
<v Speaker 1>supporters,</v>

156
00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:07.440
<v Speaker 1>especially my top tier patrion </v>
<v Speaker 1>supporters whose names are on the screen</v>

157
00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:09.660
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very many thanks to them.</v>

158
00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:12.470
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the last video about Tokyo,</v>

159
00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:17.150
<v Speaker 1>some of you asked why Toki Pona was </v>
<v Speaker 1>listed on the page of patrons and that's</v>

160
00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:17.993
<v Speaker 1>because the creator of the Tokyo </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] language has been a patron </v>

161
00:09:20.401 --> 00:09:23.580
<v Speaker 1>since last summer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but preferred not to appear on the list,</v>

162
00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:24.683
<v Speaker 1>but upon request,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've begun listing the name of the </v>

163
00:09:26.431 --> 00:09:27.264
<v Speaker 1>language instead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for watching and have a nice </v>

164
00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:30.953
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
