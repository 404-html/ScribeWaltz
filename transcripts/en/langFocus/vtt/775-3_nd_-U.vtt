00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.700
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>welcome to the focus channel and my name</v>

2
00:00:03.701 --> 00:00:08.701
<v Speaker 1>is Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hi everyone.</v>

3
00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:10.603
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to my home and today we're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to look at how I make a lang focus </v>

4
00:00:14.031 --> 00:00:14.864
<v Speaker 1>video.</v>

5
00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:28.303
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like people think I exist </v>

6
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:30.553
<v Speaker 1>inside a video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I'm walking down the street </v>

7
00:00:32.601 --> 00:00:35.360
<v Speaker 1>and someone sees me and I can tell that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they recognize me,</v>

8
00:00:35.361 --> 00:00:37.910
<v Speaker 1>but 90 percent of the time they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually talk to me.</v>

9
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.400
<v Speaker 1>They just stare at me confused like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

10
00:00:40.401 --> 00:00:43.460
<v Speaker 1>isn't that the computer simulated </v>
<v Speaker 1>humanoid from Lang Focus?</v>

11
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:44.413
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's because most of my videos </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't just me sitting in front of the </v>

12
00:00:46.971 --> 00:00:50.630
<v Speaker 1>camera and talking to the camera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put a lot of effort into crafting each</v>

13
00:00:50.631 --> 00:00:54.470
<v Speaker 1>video and producing it and basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>creating a new little world that you can</v>

14
00:00:54.471 --> 00:00:55.304
<v Speaker 1>step into today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm basically taking you behind the </v>

15
00:00:57.381 --> 00:00:58.214
<v Speaker 1>curtain and I'm showing you all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>different steps in that process of </v>

16
00:01:00.801 --> 00:01:02.360
<v Speaker 1>creating a length focus video.</v>

17
00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.380
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing that I have to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>when making a video is choose a topic.</v>

18
00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.970
<v Speaker 1>Now I have a long list of topics in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>word document that I keep on my computer</v>

19
00:01:12.971 --> 00:01:13.804
<v Speaker 1>and in dropbox and I add topics to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>list whenever I get a new idea that </v>

20
00:01:17.411 --> 00:01:18.244
<v Speaker 1>excites me and for the next couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>months I always have a short list of </v>

21
00:01:22.391 --> 00:01:25.030
<v Speaker 1>topics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a short list of topics that I want to do</v>

22
00:01:25.031 --> 00:01:25.864
<v Speaker 1>in the near future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>topics that are currently on my mind or </v>

23
00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.730
<v Speaker 1>excite me or motivate me to make a </v>
<v Speaker 1>video,</v>

24
00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.320
<v Speaker 1>and then once I finish one video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look at the shortlist and I choose the</v>

25
00:01:35.321 --> 00:01:37.960
<v Speaker 1>next video and I think which one excites</v>
<v Speaker 1>me the most?</v>

26
00:01:37.961 --> 00:01:40.120
<v Speaker 1>Which one do I really want to do right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now?</v>

27
00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.410
<v Speaker 1>Now the reason I do it like that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it really takes a lot of work to</v>

28
00:01:44.411 --> 00:01:45.244
<v Speaker 1>get through one of my videos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I'm not really excited about the </v>

29
00:01:47.561 --> 00:01:50.590
<v Speaker 1>topic or if I don't want to learn about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the topic for myself,</v>

30
00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:51.723
<v Speaker 1>then it's just torture to get through </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time and effort required to make a </v>

31
00:01:54.731 --> 00:01:55.451
<v Speaker 1>video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

32
00:01:55.451 --> 00:01:58.960
<v Speaker 1>just as an example for this video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say that I'm choosing a topic.</v>

33
00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.980
<v Speaker 1>Let's say I'm choosing the languages of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada because that's the topic that I'm</v>

34
00:02:02.981 --> 00:02:03.814
<v Speaker 1>really excited about right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really not one of the topics on </v>

35
00:02:06.371 --> 00:02:08.290
<v Speaker 1>my shortlist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's just say it is.</v>

36
00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.330
<v Speaker 1>The next step is research.</v>

37
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.893
<v Speaker 1>Nope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not an expert in every topic that I </v>

38
00:02:17.491 --> 00:02:18.324
<v Speaker 1>cover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My videos are basically like projects </v>

39
00:02:20.191 --> 00:02:21.024
<v Speaker 1>and I researched the projects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dig into the topic and I learned as </v>

40
00:02:23.701 --> 00:02:24.534
<v Speaker 1>much about it for myself as I can and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>share it with you as a way of learning </v>

41
00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.520
<v Speaker 1>for myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

42
00:02:29.521 --> 00:02:30.354
<v Speaker 1>sometimes I have background in the topic</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's a language I've studied or I've </v>

43
00:02:33.031 --> 00:02:33.864
<v Speaker 1>read about before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not always the case and even </v>

44
00:02:36.391 --> 00:02:40.140
<v Speaker 1>when it's a language I'm familiar with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I usually dig in and learn things that I</v>

45
00:02:40.141 --> 00:02:43.890
<v Speaker 1>didn't know before making the video and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's important for people to know that I</v>

46
00:02:43.891 --> 00:02:47.640
<v Speaker 1>don't like people thinking I'm sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>linguistic superman when I'm not.</v>

47
00:02:47.641 --> 00:02:48.474
<v Speaker 1>I'm just a regular guy who's interested </v>
<v Speaker 1>in languages and likes to learn more </v>

48
00:02:51.241 --> 00:02:52.074
<v Speaker 1>about them.</v>

49
00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.963
<v Speaker 1>So back to the topic of research in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>comments for every video there's always </v>

50
00:02:58.541 --> 00:02:59.740
<v Speaker 1>some person says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

51
00:02:59.741 --> 00:03:02.560
<v Speaker 1>you just copied wikipedia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

52
00:03:02.561 --> 00:03:03.394
<v Speaker 1>not quite bro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I often do start by reading a </v>

53
00:03:05.861 --> 00:03:06.694
<v Speaker 1>wikipedia article on the topic just to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get a general sense of it and basically </v>

54
00:03:10.001 --> 00:03:12.670
<v Speaker 1>to see what kinds of things I want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn about it,</v>

55
00:03:12.671 --> 00:03:13.504
<v Speaker 1>what kinds of questions I want to ask </v>
<v Speaker 1>and find the answers to and more </v>

56
00:03:16.391 --> 00:03:19.030
<v Speaker 1>reliable sources.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for this dummy topic,</v>

57
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.923
<v Speaker 1>the languages of Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're looking right now at a wikipedia </v>

58
00:03:22.031 --> 00:03:25.750
<v Speaker 1>entry and I can see some types of </v>
<v Speaker 1>information that I'd like to look up,</v>

59
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:26.733
<v Speaker 1>but for this topic I knew immediately </v>
<v Speaker 1>right off the bat that I would need to </v>

60
00:03:29.231 --> 00:03:30.064
<v Speaker 1>look at the stat can website that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Statistics Canada because it has </v>

61
00:03:33.251 --> 00:03:34.084
<v Speaker 1>information on the number of speakers of</v>
<v Speaker 1>different languages and a statistics on </v>

62
00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.940
<v Speaker 1>immigration to Canada and that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

63
00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.480
<v Speaker 1>And that's the kind of official source </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I like to use whenever possible.</v>

64
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:44.523
<v Speaker 1>Whenever researching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are new questions that come to </v>

65
00:03:46.331 --> 00:03:49.330
<v Speaker 1>mind and I use good old google to find </v>
<v Speaker 1>the answers.</v>

66
00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:50.403
<v Speaker 1>I normally look at lots of different </v>
<v Speaker 1>sources while keeping my eyes open for </v>

67
00:03:53.381 --> 00:03:54.214
<v Speaker 1>academic sources,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that includes published books as </v>

68
00:03:56.141 --> 00:03:56.974
<v Speaker 1>well as academic papers on the subject.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is especially true when dealing </v>

69
00:04:00.251 --> 00:04:01.084
<v Speaker 1>with history or historical linguistics </v>
<v Speaker 1>or when researching a language that </v>

70
00:04:04.601 --> 00:04:07.690
<v Speaker 1>isn't very widely studied,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there aren't a lot of materials about</v>

71
00:04:07.691 --> 00:04:09.130
<v Speaker 1>that language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

72
00:04:09.131 --> 00:04:09.964
<v Speaker 1>when I made my video on Kurdish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I almost exclusively used academic </v>

73
00:04:13.001 --> 00:04:16.800
<v Speaker 1>sources because there aren't that many </v>
<v Speaker 1>commercial sources dedicated to learning</v>

74
00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.840
<v Speaker 1>Kurdish when dealing with a more widely </v>
<v Speaker 1>studied language.</v>

75
00:04:19.841 --> 00:04:22.660
<v Speaker 1>I often use language learning books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the commercial type,</v>

76
00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.770
<v Speaker 1>because I have a lot of these at home </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're a good source of information</v>

77
00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:27.670
<v Speaker 1>about the language.</v>

78
00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.270
<v Speaker 1>I also use phrase books a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a lot of these as well.</v>

79
00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.520
<v Speaker 1>Phrase books are good because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>helped you to learn inductively.</v>

80
00:04:36.521 --> 00:04:40.570
<v Speaker 1>If you're that type of thinker and you'd</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to just look at examples and figure</v>

81
00:04:40.571 --> 00:04:42.970
<v Speaker 1>out how the language works based on </v>
<v Speaker 1>examples.</v>

82
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.833
<v Speaker 1>Phrase books are really good for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's basically what I'm doing when </v>

83
00:04:47.021 --> 00:04:50.440
<v Speaker 1>I analyze sentences in the videos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I break down the sentences,</v>

84
00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm basically doing what I do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>phrasebooks.</v>

85
00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:53.733
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking at the sentences and </v>
<v Speaker 1>figuring out what all the different </v>

86
00:04:55.871 --> 00:04:58.120
<v Speaker 1>parts of the sentence mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While researching.</v>

87
00:04:58.121 --> 00:05:01.270
<v Speaker 1>I often use regular nonacademic websites</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well,</v>

88
00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:02.553
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>commercial websites or just websites </v>

89
00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:06.003
<v Speaker 1>written by someone who's very interested</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that language and has knowledge of </v>

90
00:05:08.351 --> 00:05:09.184
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I use regular websites like </v>

91
00:05:10.481 --> 00:05:13.090
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look at a wide range of them and I try</v>

92
00:05:13.091 --> 00:05:13.924
<v Speaker 1>to make sure that the information I use </v>
<v Speaker 1>is backed up by all the different </v>

93
00:05:17.081 --> 00:05:17.500
<v Speaker 1>sources.</v>

94
00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.840
<v Speaker 1>I try to make sure the information is </v>
<v Speaker 1>consistent,</v>

95
00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:23.020
<v Speaker 1>but it's important to point out that </v>
<v Speaker 1>when dealing with linguistics,</v>

96
00:05:23.021 --> 00:05:27.070
<v Speaker 1>there's always quite a bit of variety of</v>
<v Speaker 1>information and there are some different</v>

97
00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.710
<v Speaker 1>opinions and there's different data </v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on the source.</v>

98
00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.080
<v Speaker 1>Even when you're looking at academic </v>
<v Speaker 1>sources,</v>

99
00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.240
<v Speaker 1>the next step is writing for almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>every video.</v>

100
00:05:37.241 --> 00:05:38.074
<v Speaker 1>I write a script.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't stick to the script 100 percent </v>

101
00:05:40.571 --> 00:05:41.404
<v Speaker 1>of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I use the script as a sort of skeleton </v>

102
00:05:43.391 --> 00:05:44.224
<v Speaker 1>for what I'm going to say and then I can</v>
<v Speaker 1>veer off of that and I can ad Lib and </v>

103
00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.440
<v Speaker 1>change things a little bit while I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>filming the video,</v>

104
00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:51.363
<v Speaker 1>but I do always have a script or almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>always have a script that I worked from </v>

105
00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:56.343
<v Speaker 1>the difficulty of writing the script </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically depends on the complexity of </v>

106
00:05:59.391 --> 00:06:00.224
<v Speaker 1>the topic and research.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try to present the information to you </v>

107
00:06:02.601 --> 00:06:04.220
<v Speaker 1>as efficiently as possible.</v>

108
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.690
<v Speaker 1>Basically presenting you as much </v>
<v Speaker 1>information as I can in a shorter period</v>

109
00:06:08.691 --> 00:06:11.960
<v Speaker 1>of time as possible while keeping it as </v>
<v Speaker 1>clear as possible.</v>

110
00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:14.960
<v Speaker 1>So I really tried to cut things down to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the core takeaway,</v>

111
00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.823
<v Speaker 1>anything unnecessary and make sure that </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything I present is linked to the </v>

112
00:06:18.921 --> 00:06:23.921
<v Speaker 1>other information and basically I try to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make it easy for myself to understand.</v>

113
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:27.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm someone who gets easily overwhelmed </v>
<v Speaker 1>by a lot of detail,</v>

114
00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:28.693
<v Speaker 1>so I basically rewrite the script until </v>
<v Speaker 1>I can understand it and if I can </v>

115
00:06:32.241 --> 00:06:33.350
<v Speaker 1>understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I get.</v>

116
00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:34.213
<v Speaker 1>I guess that you can understand it as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well because I know that I get easily </v>

117
00:06:37.281 --> 00:06:38.114
<v Speaker 1>overwhelmed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next step is to actually film the </v>

118
00:06:40.551 --> 00:06:41.271
<v Speaker 1>video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

119
00:06:41.271 --> 00:06:44.540
<v Speaker 1>some people think that this is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire video creation process,</v>

120
00:06:44.541 --> 00:06:46.280
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the easy part.</v>

121
00:06:46.281 --> 00:06:51.020
<v Speaker 1>This is the least time consuming part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Filming the video usually takes under an</v>

122
00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:51.853
<v Speaker 1>hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it can take up to about 90 minutes </v>

123
00:06:53.391 --> 00:06:57.320
<v Speaker 1>depending on how long the video is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here we're looking at my studio.</v>

124
00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:58.213
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just an extra bedroom that I </v>

125
00:06:59.451 --> 00:07:00.284
<v Speaker 1>converted into a studio and I set up a </v>
<v Speaker 1>green screen that my camera and lights </v>

126
00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:04.633
<v Speaker 1>and I actually moved last year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I moved into a bigger apartment so that </v>

127
00:07:06.951 --> 00:07:08.720
<v Speaker 1>I could set up a studio like this.</v>

128
00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:20.350
<v Speaker 1>This is the camera that I used to film </v>
<v Speaker 1>my videos until early 2017.</v>

129
00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:25.380
<v Speaker 1>It's a Canon Ivis h f r 52.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a fairly affordable,</v>

130
00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:27.820
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cam quarter.</v>

131
00:07:27.821 --> 00:07:28.654
<v Speaker 1>It costs about $300 I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's fairly easy to use except that </v>

132
00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:33.153
<v Speaker 1>it's difficult to get the focus right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of people used to comment on </v>

133
00:07:35.891 --> 00:07:38.320
<v Speaker 1>my video saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is your face out of focus?</v>

134
00:07:38.321 --> 00:07:41.590
<v Speaker 1>Or why is this lang focus if you are not</v>
<v Speaker 1>in focus?</v>

135
00:07:41.591 --> 00:07:43.020
<v Speaker 1>And that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

136
00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:47.200
<v Speaker 1>so I really had to get a new camera as </v>
<v Speaker 1>soon as I could afford to do so.</v>

137
00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.150
<v Speaker 1>This one right here is my current </v>
<v Speaker 1>camera.</v>

138
00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:50.223
<v Speaker 1>It's a Sony cyber shots are x 100,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it costs about a thousand dollars and </v>

139
00:07:54.221 --> 00:07:56.350
<v Speaker 1>it's much better to focus as much </v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

140
00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:58.090
<v Speaker 1>And just in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a great camera.</v>

141
00:07:58.540 --> 00:07:59.373
<v Speaker 1>The only thing that I have a problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>with is that digital cameras like this </v>

142
00:08:02.381 --> 00:08:05.110
<v Speaker 1>usually time out after 30 minutes of </v>
<v Speaker 1>video.</v>

143
00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:06.123
<v Speaker 1>So sometimes I'm in the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 1>filming and I don't realize that 30 </v>

144
00:08:08.831 --> 00:08:09.664
<v Speaker 1>minutes have passed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then later when I checked the video </v>

145
00:08:11.741 --> 00:08:13.810
<v Speaker 1>file,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see that the ending was cut off.</v>

146
00:08:13.811 --> 00:08:15.820
<v Speaker 1>So I have to refilm part of the video.</v>

147
00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:18.880
<v Speaker 1>The hardest part about filming is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>lighting.</v>

148
00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:22.510
<v Speaker 1>Knowing where to put the lights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how close I should be to the lights,</v>

149
00:08:22.511 --> 00:08:23.800
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how bright they should be,</v>

150
00:08:23.801 --> 00:08:26.050
<v Speaker 1>what kind of light bulbs to use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of thing.</v>

151
00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:29.260
<v Speaker 1>You guys probably don't notice it when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you watch youtube videos,</v>

152
00:08:29.261 --> 00:08:33.130
<v Speaker 1>but lighting is essential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually have two lights near me right</v>

153
00:08:33.131 --> 00:08:33.964
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's this one over here and there's </v>

154
00:08:34.721 --> 00:08:36.660
<v Speaker 1>another one in front of me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

155
00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:41.790
<v Speaker 1>just outside of this room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's just warm up for a minute and talk</v>

156
00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:42.883
<v Speaker 1>and talk and talk and talk some more and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then get into talking with this clear </v>

157
00:08:47.781 --> 00:08:50.700
<v Speaker 1>voice while I'm breathing so that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't hyperventilate.</v>

158
00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:51.633
<v Speaker 1>I am right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And just get into it normally as I </v>

159
00:08:53.651 --> 00:08:55.530
<v Speaker 1>always do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

160
00:08:55.531 --> 00:08:57.150
<v Speaker 1>Just going to talk for a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get warmed up,</v>

161
00:08:57.151 --> 00:09:00.780
<v Speaker 1>get into the zone so I can speak </v>
<v Speaker 1>normally as I always do on camera,</v>

162
00:09:00.781 --> 00:09:01.614
<v Speaker 1>just like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except this time it's going to be about </v>

163
00:09:03.391 --> 00:09:04.224
<v Speaker 1>French,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which isn't really different than usual </v>

164
00:09:06.121 --> 00:09:06.954
<v Speaker 1>except that the topic is different and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why I'm just doing another video </v>

165
00:09:10.411 --> 00:09:11.040
<v Speaker 1>just like this.</v>

166
00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:11.873
<v Speaker 1>It's no different than usual except that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm wearing a blue shirt and the green </v>

167
00:09:14.051 --> 00:09:16.140
<v Speaker 1>screen is behind me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's the same.</v>

168
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:20.340
<v Speaker 1>And I've got this time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to hold the phone in front</v>

169
00:09:20.341 --> 00:09:21.174
<v Speaker 1>of the camera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be very careful not to do </v>

170
00:09:22.561 --> 00:09:24.510
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's also hot in this room.</v>

171
00:09:24.511 --> 00:09:29.511
<v Speaker 1>So I have some water and I have a towel </v>
<v Speaker 1>just in case I start to sweat a lot.</v>

172
00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:32.220
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully that won't be a problem in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this video.</v>

173
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:37.310
<v Speaker 1>I guess we'll see while filming a video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I usually have my iphone in my hand.</v>

174
00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:38.773
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you might see my iphone pop up</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the screen when I fail to keep my </v>

175
00:09:41.931 --> 00:09:45.560
<v Speaker 1>hands down low where they should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I use the iphone for two things.</v>

176
00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:46.453
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a script on the screen which I </v>

177
00:09:49.191 --> 00:09:52.910
<v Speaker 1>refer to when necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also it connects to a microphone.</v>

178
00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:56.330
<v Speaker 1>You can see right here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm wearing a level II or microphone.</v>

179
00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:57.193
<v Speaker 1>This is the smart lab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the rode smartlav leveling or </v>

180
00:10:01.131 --> 00:10:02.810
<v Speaker 1>microphone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is quite good,</v>

181
00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:04.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cost about $100 button.</v>

182
00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:07.940
<v Speaker 1>It gets something near to studio </v>
<v Speaker 1>quality.</v>

183
00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:08.983
<v Speaker 1>So I quite like it and I use the road </v>
<v Speaker 1>recording app on the iphone and you can </v>

184
00:10:14.781 --> 00:10:19.370
<v Speaker 1>see that that the audio file is being </v>
<v Speaker 1>recorded as I speak right now.</v>

185
00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:20.233
<v Speaker 1>And later I can use dropbox to deliver </v>
<v Speaker 1>the file to my computer and then pop it </v>

186
00:10:23.901 --> 00:10:26.810
<v Speaker 1>into the editing software.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's all very easy.</v>

187
00:10:26.811 --> 00:10:27.644
<v Speaker 1>And convenient,</v>

188
00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:33.610
<v Speaker 1>the next step is to find the images that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to include in the video,</v>

189
00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:37.990
<v Speaker 1>so I read through the script and I tried</v>
<v Speaker 1>to imagine what kind of images I want to</v>

190
00:10:37.991 --> 00:10:38.824
<v Speaker 1>include,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what kind of images should accompany my </v>

191
00:10:40.451 --> 00:10:41.284
<v Speaker 1>voice and the narration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This includes background images like </v>

192
00:10:43.631 --> 00:10:47.770
<v Speaker 1>scenery or maps or sometimes a photos of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people from a certain country.</v>

193
00:10:47.771 --> 00:10:51.070
<v Speaker 1>If I'm talking about that country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes historical photos,</v>

194
00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:53.890
<v Speaker 1>that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I often use a site called Pixabay,</v>

195
00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:58.540
<v Speaker 1>which is a source of copyright free </v>
<v Speaker 1>images submitted by users,</v>

196
00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:01.030
<v Speaker 1>so the images are all free and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually pretty good.</v>

197
00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:01.893
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of professional </v>
<v Speaker 1>photographers upload some of their </v>

198
00:11:04.391 --> 00:11:08.530
<v Speaker 1>photos to picks a bay just to get some </v>
<v Speaker 1>exposure or just for fun or whatever.</v>

199
00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:09.543
<v Speaker 1>I also buy some stock images as well as </v>
<v Speaker 1>using some public domain images or </v>

200
00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:14.110
<v Speaker 1>noncommercial images.</v>

201
00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:15.153
<v Speaker 1>I put all of these images into folders </v>
<v Speaker 1>on my computer so that I can find them </v>

202
00:11:18.191 --> 00:11:20.560
<v Speaker 1>in the next step during the editing </v>
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>

203
00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:23.170
<v Speaker 1>That brings me to the next step,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is editing.</v>

204
00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:27.250
<v Speaker 1>Now this is another very time consuming </v>
<v Speaker 1>parts of making a lang focus video.</v>

205
00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:30.220
<v Speaker 1>The editing software I use is called </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sony Vegas,</v>

206
00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:31.840
<v Speaker 1>which is all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty good.</v>

207
00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:35.740
<v Speaker 1>There might be some better software out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there like adobe premier or something,</v>

208
00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:36.603
<v Speaker 1>but I just stick to what I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sony Vegas is familiar to me so I just </v>

209
00:11:39.821 --> 00:11:40.654
<v Speaker 1>keep using it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first thing I do when editing is I </v>

210
00:11:42.641 --> 00:11:43.474
<v Speaker 1>take the video and audio files from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>filming process and I lined them up on </v>

211
00:11:46.901 --> 00:11:47.734
<v Speaker 1>the timeline so that the audio from my </v>
<v Speaker 1>mic lines up with the audio from the </v>

212
00:11:50.831 --> 00:11:51.664
<v Speaker 1>camera and then I turn off the cameras </v>
<v Speaker 1>so that all you hear is the audio from </v>

213
00:11:55.271 --> 00:11:56.104
<v Speaker 1>the level ear mic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So right now let me play you something </v>

214
00:11:57.821 --> 00:11:59.800
<v Speaker 1>using just the audio from the mic.</v>

215
00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:01.863
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and </v>

216
00:12:03.791 --> 00:12:04.624
<v Speaker 1>my name is Paul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if I turn on the audio from the </v>

217
00:12:07.331 --> 00:12:08.740
<v Speaker 1>camera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sounds like this.</v>

218
00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:09.783
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and </v>

219
00:12:11.681 --> 00:12:12.514
<v Speaker 1>my name is Paul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you get a much cleaner sound if you </v>

220
00:12:15.191 --> 00:12:17.020
<v Speaker 1>remove the cameras,</v>
<v Speaker 1>echoey audio.</v>

221
00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:18.623
<v Speaker 1>After that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I do is go through all the footage </v>

222
00:12:20.101 --> 00:12:20.934
<v Speaker 1>and I cut it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I removed all of the pauses and that </v>

223
00:12:22.671 --> 00:12:23.504
<v Speaker 1>remove anything that I've repeated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like sometimes I repeat the same </v>

224
00:12:26.281 --> 00:12:27.114
<v Speaker 1>sentence several times just to get the </v>
<v Speaker 1>delivery right and when I'm editing all </v>

225
00:12:30.751 --> 00:12:31.584
<v Speaker 1>listen to all of the versions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll take away all the ones I don't </v>

226
00:12:33.631 --> 00:12:34.464
<v Speaker 1>want and just keep the best one so it </v>
<v Speaker 1>usually takes a couple hours just to go </v>

227
00:12:37.231 --> 00:12:38.064
<v Speaker 1>through the footage and cut it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A typical 10 minute video probably </v>

228
00:12:41.011 --> 00:12:41.844
<v Speaker 1>begins with about 45 minutes to an hour </v>
<v Speaker 1>of footage and then I cut it down to </v>

229
00:12:45.361 --> 00:12:46.200
<v Speaker 1>about 10 minutes.</v>

230
00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:47.363
<v Speaker 1>Next I removed the green screen </v>
<v Speaker 1>background using the Chroma key </v>

231
00:12:49.801 --> 00:12:52.320
<v Speaker 1>function.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm basically removing everything that's</v>

232
00:12:52.321 --> 00:12:53.154
<v Speaker 1>bright green so that it becomes </v>
<v Speaker 1>transparent and that means that I can't </v>

233
00:12:56.181 --> 00:12:58.970
<v Speaker 1>wear a green shirt because I'll become </v>
<v Speaker 1>transparent,</v>

234
00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:00.043
<v Speaker 1>but you can see that my green screen </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't actually cover the entire space </v>

235
00:13:02.751 --> 00:13:04.790
<v Speaker 1>behind me because of the layout of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>room.</v>

236
00:13:04.791 --> 00:13:08.330
<v Speaker 1>There's just not a lot of space to put </v>
<v Speaker 1>the green screen rack in there.</v>

237
00:13:08.331 --> 00:13:09.164
<v Speaker 1>So the positioning is kind of awkward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I have to create a mask and cut out </v>

238
00:13:12.801 --> 00:13:14.850
<v Speaker 1>everything that's outside of the green </v>
<v Speaker 1>screen.</v>

239
00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:19.110
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now that there's nothing behind me,</v>

240
00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:21.060
<v Speaker 1>we're ready to place an image behind me</v>

241
00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:25.130
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look guys,</v>

242
00:13:25.131 --> 00:13:27.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm in a classroom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you've probably noticed.</v>

243
00:13:27.981 --> 00:13:28.814
<v Speaker 1>I use a lot of visual elements in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>videos and the large amount of </v>

244
00:13:31.671 --> 00:13:36.380
<v Speaker 1>information that I try to cram into one </v>
<v Speaker 1>video means that I have to include a lot</v>

245
00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:39.320
<v Speaker 1>of visual detail and arrange it so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all clear.</v>

246
00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:42.530
<v Speaker 1>While editing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I make a lot of infographics now.</v>

247
00:13:42.531 --> 00:13:43.364
<v Speaker 1>This can be a very time consuming </v>
<v Speaker 1>process because of how detailed </v>

248
00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:46.933
<v Speaker 1>languages and linguistics can be and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what looks like one infographic to you </v>

249
00:13:50.451 --> 00:13:51.284
<v Speaker 1>is actually a lot of different files so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I can animate the graphic and make </v>

250
00:13:54.471 --> 00:13:56.900
<v Speaker 1>different elements gradually appear on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the screen.</v>

251
00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:01.780
<v Speaker 1>I make these infographics screens using </v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple of different tools.</v>

252
00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:04.960
<v Speaker 1>One of them is picmonkey and the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>is paint.net.</v>

253
00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:06.063
<v Speaker 1>Depending on exactly what functions I </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to use at the moment while I'm </v>

254
00:14:08.861 --> 00:14:11.680
<v Speaker 1>editing the video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I take the images that I've gathered and</v>

255
00:14:11.681 --> 00:14:12.514
<v Speaker 1>the screens I've created and I import </v>
<v Speaker 1>them into the Sony Vegas Media Library </v>

256
00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:18.820
<v Speaker 1>so that I can arrange them and layer </v>
<v Speaker 1>them on the timeline.</v>

257
00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:23.900
<v Speaker 1>I also add any audio that I need to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>timeline.</v>

258
00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:24.853
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I have to rerecord some parts </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the audio because the sound was </v>

259
00:14:27.861 --> 00:14:31.400
<v Speaker 1>muffled or because I said one word wrong</v>
<v Speaker 1>or something like that,</v>

260
00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:32.503
<v Speaker 1>and I also sometimes use audio from </v>
<v Speaker 1>volunteers like language samples from </v>

261
00:14:36.021 --> 00:14:36.854
<v Speaker 1>volunteers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I find volunteers to record some </v>

262
00:14:38.751 --> 00:14:39.584
<v Speaker 1>language samples for a video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I usually do that during the editing </v>

263
00:14:41.871 --> 00:14:44.390
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you follow Lang focus on facebook,</v>

264
00:14:44.391 --> 00:14:47.540
<v Speaker 1>you've probably seen me post a request </v>
<v Speaker 1>for volunteers.</v>

265
00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:50.000
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm making a video on Greek.</v>

266
00:14:50.001 --> 00:14:52.850
<v Speaker 1>I need a volunteer speak Greek or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

267
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:55.010
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I get a lot of responses.</v>

268
00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:58.580
<v Speaker 1>Then I choose one or two people and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>record their samples for me.</v>

269
00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:01.700
<v Speaker 1>I can't choose everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm grateful for all of the offers.</v>

270
00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:05.300
<v Speaker 1>So after I have those audio clips from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the volunteer,</v>

271
00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:06.163
<v Speaker 1>then I add those onto the timeline and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's usually one of the last steps of </v>

272
00:15:09.351 --> 00:15:10.490
<v Speaker 1>the editing process.</v>

273
00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:13.070
<v Speaker 1>So you see I'm wearing these glasses </v>
<v Speaker 1>right here.</v>

274
00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:15.890
<v Speaker 1>These glasses are actually blue </v>
<v Speaker 1>blockers.</v>

275
00:15:15.891 --> 00:15:20.150
<v Speaker 1>They help block out the blue light from </v>
<v Speaker 1>my computer screen and from the lights I</v>

276
00:15:20.151 --> 00:15:20.984
<v Speaker 1>use while filming and all of that blue </v>
<v Speaker 1>light I guess ignites your brain and </v>

277
00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:26.930
<v Speaker 1>keeps you up at night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes it harder to sleep because your</v>

278
00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:27.823
<v Speaker 1>mind is activated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So by wearing these like just block out </v>

279
00:15:30.921 --> 00:15:34.520
<v Speaker 1>that light and rest a little bit more </v>
<v Speaker 1>easily when I go to sleep.</v>

280
00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:38.690
<v Speaker 1>So these are quite helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wear these every day after editing.</v>

281
00:15:38.691 --> 00:15:43.190
<v Speaker 1>The next step is to choose music usually</v>
<v Speaker 1>after editing sometimes earlier,</v>

282
00:15:43.191 --> 00:15:47.150
<v Speaker 1>but typically after editing I get music </v>
<v Speaker 1>from a few different sources.</v>

283
00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:50.450
<v Speaker 1>One of the main ones is the youtube </v>
<v Speaker 1>audio library,</v>

284
00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:51.313
<v Speaker 1>which is a source of copyright free </v>
<v Speaker 1>music that Youtube creators can use for </v>

285
00:15:54.831 --> 00:15:55.664
<v Speaker 1>free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some of us end up using the same </v>

286
00:15:57.660 --> 00:15:58.880
<v Speaker 1>songs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same tracks.</v>

287
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.850
<v Speaker 1>So sometimes in the comments I get </v>
<v Speaker 1>comments like,</v>

288
00:16:01.851 --> 00:16:03.620
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you stole that song from h three,</v>

289
00:16:03.621 --> 00:16:04.700
<v Speaker 1>h three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or hey,</v>

290
00:16:04.701 --> 00:16:07.940
<v Speaker 1>that's the dubs content cop song or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

291
00:16:07.941 --> 00:16:11.180
<v Speaker 1>But in reality we all got those songs </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the same source,</v>

292
00:16:11.181 --> 00:16:12.014
<v Speaker 1>from the Youtube Audio Library and there</v>
<v Speaker 1>are other sources of copyright free </v>

293
00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:16.303
<v Speaker 1>music as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them are youtube channels that </v>

294
00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:21.080
<v Speaker 1>offer copyright free music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them are websites,</v>

295
00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:22.333
<v Speaker 1>but it can be a little hard to find </v>
<v Speaker 1>something suitable so you might notice </v>

296
00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:28.490
<v Speaker 1>the same music in several different </v>
<v Speaker 1>videos on my channel.</v>

297
00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:30.410
<v Speaker 1>That's because when I find something </v>
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>

298
00:16:30.411 --> 00:16:33.170
<v Speaker 1>it's hard not to use it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After adding music.</v>

299
00:16:33.171 --> 00:16:34.004
<v Speaker 1>The next step is audio mastering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I go through all the footage through </v>

300
00:16:36.861 --> 00:16:40.190
<v Speaker 1>the whole video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to each individual audio clip,</v>

301
00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:42.230
<v Speaker 1>making sure that everything is </v>
<v Speaker 1>consistent,</v>

302
00:16:42.231 --> 00:16:43.064
<v Speaker 1>that the volume is about the same and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the quality of sound is about the </v>

303
00:16:46.161 --> 00:16:47.870
<v Speaker 1>same for all the different clips.</v>

304
00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:49.153
<v Speaker 1>This includes adding audio compression </v>
<v Speaker 1>and also eat q to bring out the right </v>

305
00:16:52.491 --> 00:16:56.360
<v Speaker 1>frequencies and if there are audio </v>
<v Speaker 1>samples from a volunteer,</v>

306
00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:57.373
<v Speaker 1>they often have a different sound to </v>
<v Speaker 1>them and they can get lost in the mix </v>

307
00:16:59.841 --> 00:17:00.674
<v Speaker 1>quite easily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I try to eat q them so that they are </v>

308
00:17:02.451 --> 00:17:05.240
<v Speaker 1>clear on standout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The final step is rendering.</v>

309
00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:08.750
<v Speaker 1>Rendering means you're creating the </v>
<v Speaker 1>final video file,</v>

310
00:17:08.751 --> 00:17:09.584
<v Speaker 1>so basically the editing software,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sony Vegas takes all of the individual </v>

311
00:17:12.831 --> 00:17:13.664
<v Speaker 1>clips from the timeline and puts them </v>
<v Speaker 1>all together and create one file out of </v>

312
00:17:17.301 --> 00:17:18.134
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This can take a long time depending on </v>

313
00:17:19.881 --> 00:17:20.714
<v Speaker 1>your computer and depending on how long </v>
<v Speaker 1>the video is and depending on how many </v>

314
00:17:24.111 --> 00:17:27.110
<v Speaker 1>different files are on your timeline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With my current computer,</v>

315
00:17:27.111 --> 00:17:29.900
<v Speaker 1>it typically takes around an hour to </v>
<v Speaker 1>render a video,</v>

316
00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:30.943
<v Speaker 1>but on my old computer at sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 1>three or four hours while the video is </v>

317
00:17:34.281 --> 00:17:35.114
<v Speaker 1>rendering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put together a thumbnail using </v>

318
00:17:36.681 --> 00:17:37.514
<v Speaker 1>picmonkey.</v>

319
00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:38.383
<v Speaker 1>There's usually an image of myself in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the thumbnail and that's not because I </v>

320
00:17:41.691 --> 00:17:42.524
<v Speaker 1>want attention or because the video is </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be about me or something </v>

321
00:17:45.651 --> 00:17:47.180
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really not.</v>

322
00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:48.253
<v Speaker 1>I just do this as a way of my channel </v>
<v Speaker 1>because when people who like Lang focus </v>

323
00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:53.333
<v Speaker 1>see me in the thumbnail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they know that I have a new video and </v>

324
00:17:55.351 --> 00:17:58.860
<v Speaker 1>they click on it immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try to make the thumbnail,</v>

325
00:17:58.861 --> 00:17:59.694
<v Speaker 1>catch people's eye using a background </v>
<v Speaker 1>image behind me and using some texts </v>

326
00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:03.793
<v Speaker 1>that stands out and I also run the </v>
<v Speaker 1>thumbnail through a filter sometimes </v>

327
00:18:07.381 --> 00:18:10.500
<v Speaker 1>like through a photo filter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way people do on instagram.</v>

328
00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:13.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't notice a lot of other youtube </v>
<v Speaker 1>creators doing this,</v>

329
00:18:13.561 --> 00:18:15.290
<v Speaker 1>but I find it gives us sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

330
00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:17.880
<v Speaker 1>interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unreal effect to the thumbnails.</v>

331
00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:21.330
<v Speaker 1>So once the video is finished,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rendering of the thumbnail is ready,</v>

332
00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:24.720
<v Speaker 1>then I upload them to youtube on my old </v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet connection.</v>

333
00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:25.703
<v Speaker 1>This used to take hours and hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it took six hours to upload a </v>

334
00:18:28.531 --> 00:18:29.364
<v Speaker 1>video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but currently I have vdsl internet and </v>

335
00:18:31.951 --> 00:18:35.070
<v Speaker 1>it only takes like five or 10 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is heaven.</v>

336
00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:38.310
<v Speaker 1>After adding a title tags and </v>
<v Speaker 1>description to the video,</v>

337
00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:39.203
<v Speaker 1>then it's time to publish it and share </v>
<v Speaker 1>it to social media so that all you </v>

338
00:18:42.331 --> 00:18:46.800
<v Speaker 1>wonderful people know about the video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is actually quite important because</v>

339
00:18:46.801 --> 00:18:50.460
<v Speaker 1>youtube judges the importance of a video</v>
<v Speaker 1>based on view velocity,</v>

340
00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:51.473
<v Speaker 1>the number of views that the video gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a shorter amount of time right after </v>

341
00:18:54.571 --> 00:18:55.404
<v Speaker 1>it's released,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if I upload a video and a lot of you </v>

342
00:18:58.111 --> 00:18:58.944
<v Speaker 1>immediately watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If a thousand of you watch it in the </v>

343
00:19:00.811 --> 00:19:02.640
<v Speaker 1>first two minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then youtube says,</v>

344
00:19:02.641 --> 00:19:04.440
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this must be an important video,</v>

345
00:19:04.441 --> 00:19:07.020
<v Speaker 1>and they share it with other people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>promote it more,</v>

346
00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:08.123
<v Speaker 1>but on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if only a couple of you watch the video </v>

347
00:19:10.561 --> 00:19:12.360
<v Speaker 1>in the first couple of minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Youtube says,</v>

348
00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:14.550
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his fans don't care about this video.</v>

349
00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:16.470
<v Speaker 1>It must suck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's not promote it.</v>

350
00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:17.873
<v Speaker 1>This happened with my video on Japanese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The original thumbnail of the video </v>

351
00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:24.000
<v Speaker 1>wasn't the typical Lang focus thumbnail </v>
<v Speaker 1>style.</v>

352
00:19:24.001 --> 00:19:24.834
<v Speaker 1>I didn't appear in the thumbnail and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just looked different so people </v>

353
00:19:27.511 --> 00:19:28.344
<v Speaker 1>didn't realize it was my video at first </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the number of people who clicked on </v>

354
00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:35.880
<v Speaker 1>the thumbnail in the first couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes was lower than usual and youtube</v>

355
00:19:35.881 --> 00:19:38.580
<v Speaker 1>set up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This video isn't worth promoting.</v>

356
00:19:38.581 --> 00:19:42.390
<v Speaker 1>So the video really struggled to get as </v>
<v Speaker 1>many views as it should have,</v>

357
00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:43.463
<v Speaker 1>so that means when you guys rushed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>watch one of my videos and you write </v>

358
00:19:45.901 --> 00:19:48.720
<v Speaker 1>first in the comments and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually a good thing.</v>

359
00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:52.350
<v Speaker 1>So that's the basic approach I take to </v>
<v Speaker 1>making a lang focus video.</v>

360
00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:53.243
<v Speaker 1>My experience making the video is </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably quite different from your </v>

361
00:19:55.921 --> 00:19:56.754
<v Speaker 1>experience watching the video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really a lot of hard work and I </v>

362
00:20:00.061 --> 00:20:03.270
<v Speaker 1>regularly clock 100 hours making a </v>
<v Speaker 1>single video.</v>

363
00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:05.940
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to cut that down actually.</v>

364
00:20:05.941 --> 00:20:06.774
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to do more concise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shorter videos on narrower topics </v>

365
00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:13.430
<v Speaker 1>basically for my own sanity and to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

366
00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:16.920
<v Speaker 1>to make everything more sustainable over</v>
<v Speaker 1>a long period of time.</v>

367
00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:18.143
<v Speaker 1>But I do intend to keep making videos </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I hope you find interesting and </v>

368
00:20:22.141 --> 00:20:25.830
<v Speaker 1>educational and motivating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really the goal of losing focus</v>

369
00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:26.723
<v Speaker 1>and has been since the start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So shall we do a question of the day as </v>

370
00:20:29.311 --> 00:20:30.420
<v Speaker 1>usual?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

371
00:20:30.421 --> 00:20:31.254
<v Speaker 1>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was there anything about the video </v>

372
00:20:32.911 --> 00:20:35.670
<v Speaker 1>making process that stood out to you or </v>
<v Speaker 1>surprised you?</v>

373
