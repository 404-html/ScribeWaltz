<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and </v>

3
00:00:07.291 --> 00:00:11.340
<v Speaker 1>my name is polled it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why did English become the international</v>

4
00:00:11.341 --> 00:00:13.590
<v Speaker 1>language?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the question that we're going to</v>

5
00:00:13.591 --> 00:00:14.424
<v Speaker 1>answer today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>English is the defacto Global Lingua </v>

6
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.320
<v Speaker 1>Franca.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the language of global commerce.</v>

7
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.960
<v Speaker 1>It's the main language of international </v>
<v Speaker 1>diplomacy.</v>

8
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.830
<v Speaker 1>It's the language of air traffic control</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's the language of the majority of</v>

9
00:00:25.831 --> 00:00:28.620
<v Speaker 1>academic journals and maybe most </v>
<v Speaker 1>importantly for us,</v>

10
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.190
<v Speaker 1>it's the most common language on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet and it's also the language that</v>

11
00:00:32.191 --> 00:00:33.024
<v Speaker 1>international travelers with different </v>
<v Speaker 1>native languages used to communicate </v>

12
00:00:35.731 --> 00:00:38.550
<v Speaker 1>with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The very definition of a Lingua Franca,</v>

13
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.040
<v Speaker 1>but how did English reach this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>status?</v>

14
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:41.903
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's partly because of the role of the </v>

15
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.780
<v Speaker 1>United States of America as a global </v>
<v Speaker 1>superpower,</v>

16
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.200
<v Speaker 1>but the stage was set earlier than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the 16th century,</v>

17
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.093
<v Speaker 1>England started to establish overseas </v>
<v Speaker 1>colonies and by the end of the 18th </v>

18
00:00:53.131 --> 00:00:53.964
<v Speaker 1>century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the British Empire had grown quite </v>

19
00:00:55.351 --> 00:00:59.550
<v Speaker 1>extensive with colonies and a few parts </v>
<v Speaker 1>of India and Africa in the Caribbean,</v>

20
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:00.563
<v Speaker 1>Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what was to become the United </v>

21
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.460
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>

22
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.670
<v Speaker 1>The British were not the only ones </v>
<v Speaker 1>establishing colonies of course,</v>

23
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.360
<v Speaker 1>much of present day Canada and the US </v>
<v Speaker 1>was part of new France,</v>

24
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.030
<v Speaker 1>a large area that had been colonized by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the French,</v>

25
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.163
<v Speaker 1>but these areas were lost to the British</v>
<v Speaker 1>during the seven years war and much of </v>

26
00:01:16.321 --> 00:01:17.154
<v Speaker 1>what is now the southern and western </v>
<v Speaker 1>United States was colonized by the </v>

27
00:01:19.681 --> 00:01:22.710
<v Speaker 1>Spanish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but these areas were taken by the United</v>

28
00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.840
<v Speaker 1>States in wars with Spain and later </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexico.</v>

29
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.210
<v Speaker 1>The Dutch had also colonized an area </v>
<v Speaker 1>known as New Netherlands,</v>

30
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.160
<v Speaker 1>but it was lost to the British and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>late 17th century.</v>

31
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:33.713
<v Speaker 1>There were also non British immigrants </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the British colonies of North </v>

32
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.230
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

33
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.800
<v Speaker 1>German speaking immigrants for a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the USA is history.</v>

34
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.620
<v Speaker 1>German was at second most widely spoken </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

35
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.580
<v Speaker 1>It declined in use during the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>world war because of the stigma of being</v>

36
00:01:47.581 --> 00:01:48.414
<v Speaker 1>associated with Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So while there were numerous languages </v>

37
00:01:51.361 --> 00:01:52.194
<v Speaker 1>spoken by settlers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>English became the dominant language of </v>

38
00:01:54.391 --> 00:01:55.224
<v Speaker 1>the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The British kept on establishing </v>

39
00:01:56.971 --> 00:01:57.804
<v Speaker 1>colonies after American independence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including much larger areas of the </v>

40
00:02:01.021 --> 00:02:04.440
<v Speaker 1>Indian subcontinent and Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia and New Zealand,</v>

41
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.970
<v Speaker 1>and after the first world war in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Middle East in 1922,</v>

42
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.050
<v Speaker 1>the British empire covered almost a </v>
<v Speaker 1>quarter of the earth and about one fifth</v>

43
00:02:13.051 --> 00:02:16.290
<v Speaker 1>of the world's population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of these countries became populated</v>

44
00:02:16.291 --> 00:02:17.124
<v Speaker 1>by English settlers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and these are the countries where </v>

45
00:02:18.661 --> 00:02:21.720
<v Speaker 1>English became the dominant language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>replacing many others.</v>
