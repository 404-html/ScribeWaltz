<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and </v>

2
00:00:03.571 --> 00:00:07.920
<v Speaker 1>my name is Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What should I talk about today?</v>

3
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.790
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I should talk about a language </v>
<v Speaker 1>spoken by tens of millions of people.</v>

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:12.833
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I should talk about one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world's major language families or a </v>

5
00:00:15.541 --> 00:00:18.150
<v Speaker 1>country with stunning linguistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>diversity.</v>

6
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.063
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think today I'll talk about something </v>

7
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.890
<v Speaker 1>a little different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today's topic is Toky Pona Toki Pona.</v>

8
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.430
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Toki poner is a constructed language,</v>

9
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.293
<v Speaker 1>meaning that it did not arise naturally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was created by someone in order </v>

10
00:00:33.841 --> 00:00:36.480
<v Speaker 1>to fulfill certain criteria or a certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>vision.</v>

11
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.140
<v Speaker 1>The most well known constructed language</v>
<v Speaker 1>might be Esperanto,</v>

12
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.660
<v Speaker 1>which I made a video about a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

13
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.853
<v Speaker 1>Toki Pono is another constructed </v>
<v Speaker 1>language that I thought was unique and </v>

14
00:00:46.381 --> 00:00:48.390
<v Speaker 1>interesting enough to make a video </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

15
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.253
<v Speaker 1>It's not spoken by very many people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's well known amongst fans of </v>

16
00:00:52.021 --> 00:00:55.710
<v Speaker 1>constructed languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The name Toki Pono means the language of</v>

17
00:00:55.711 --> 00:00:56.544
<v Speaker 1>good and as a minimalist language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea behind it is extreme </v>

18
00:01:00.091 --> 00:01:02.880
<v Speaker 1>simplicity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in its core vocabulary.</v>

19
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.660
<v Speaker 1>The purpose of Toki Pona is not just to </v>
<v Speaker 1>simplify communication,</v>

20
00:01:06.661 --> 00:01:07.494
<v Speaker 1>but to simplify your own thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To force yourself to eliminate </v>

21
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.100
<v Speaker 1>unnecessary information and ideas and </v>
<v Speaker 1>focus on what's really important.</v>

22
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.990
<v Speaker 1>Toki Pona has a core vocabulary of only </v>
<v Speaker 1>123 words.</v>

23
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.040
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you heard that,</v>

24
00:01:20.041 --> 00:01:22.470
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>123 words.</v>

25
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:23.633
<v Speaker 1>You can learn those hundred and 23 words</v>
<v Speaker 1>in just a couple of hours using an app </v>

26
00:01:26.731 --> 00:01:29.210
<v Speaker 1>like memorize or unlucky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should point out that.</v>
