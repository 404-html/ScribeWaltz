00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.030
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the Lange focus channel in.</v>

2
00:00:03.031 --> 00:00:03.864
<v Speaker 1>My name is Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today we're going to talk about the </v>

3
00:00:05.641 --> 00:00:10.641
<v Speaker 1>language of pigeons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>

4
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.770
<v Speaker 1>I know that joke isn't very good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's all I've got.</v>

5
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.023
<v Speaker 1>Today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to talk about some special </v>

6
00:00:16.351 --> 00:00:19.380
<v Speaker 1>kinds of languages called pigeons and </v>
<v Speaker 1>creoles.</v>

7
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.450
<v Speaker 1>You've probably heard those terms </v>
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>

8
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.740
<v Speaker 1>maybe in the names of certain languages </v>
<v Speaker 1>like pigeon English or Haitian Creole,</v>

9
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:26.693
<v Speaker 1>but please note there is not just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>single pigeon language or a single </v>

10
00:00:29.761 --> 00:00:30.594
<v Speaker 1>creole language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are actually referring to </v>

11
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:33.203
<v Speaker 1>categories of languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are many pigeons and many creoles </v>

12
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.590
<v Speaker 1>around the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>

13
00:00:37.591 --> 00:00:39.090
<v Speaker 1>what do they have in common?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

14
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:39.953
<v Speaker 1>pigeons and creoles are new languages </v>
<v Speaker 1>that develop when speakers of different </v>

15
00:00:43.471 --> 00:00:47.190
<v Speaker 1>languages come into contact with each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other and have a need to communicate.</v>

16
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.233
<v Speaker 1>Many pigeons and creoles have arisen </v>
<v Speaker 1>when colonial powers came into contact </v>

17
00:00:51.661 --> 00:00:54.570
<v Speaker 1>with local people as they spread around </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

18
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.420
<v Speaker 1>So what's the difference between pigeons</v>
<v Speaker 1>and creoles?</v>

19
00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.370
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pigeons are non native,</v>

20
00:00:59.371 --> 00:01:02.370
<v Speaker 1>Lingua Franca as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Creoles have native speakers,</v>

21
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.040
<v Speaker 1>but let me get into both types of </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

22
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.200
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pidgin languages,</v>

23
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.440
<v Speaker 1>as I just mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pidgin languages have no native speakers</v>

24
00:01:10.441 --> 00:01:12.750
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Languages that arise very suddenly,</v>

25
00:01:12.751 --> 00:01:16.830
<v Speaker 1>very quickly when there is a need for </v>
<v Speaker 1>communication in a certain situation.</v>

26
00:01:16.831 --> 00:01:19.260
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for trade or for Labor,</v>

27
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.333
<v Speaker 1>the pigeon language is a sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>compromise between two different </v>

28
00:01:22.831 --> 00:01:23.664
<v Speaker 1>languages or between multiple languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pigeons usually arise when one group of </v>

29
00:01:27.331 --> 00:01:31.560
<v Speaker 1>people is dominant over another group of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and the less dominant group needs</v>

30
00:01:31.561 --> 00:01:34.350
<v Speaker 1>to learn to communicate with the more </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominant group,</v>

31
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.340
<v Speaker 1>but without any formal education in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>language of that dominant group,</v>

32
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:39.413
<v Speaker 1>they adopt the sort of simplified </v>
<v Speaker 1>language based on the most basic </v>

33
00:01:42.331 --> 00:01:43.164
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary of that dominant groups </v>
<v Speaker 1>language and based on the most basic </v>

34
00:01:46.591 --> 00:01:48.870
<v Speaker 1>grammar of their own native language.</v>

35
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.560
<v Speaker 1>This happens most commonly in situations</v>
<v Speaker 1>of trade slavery or colonial contact,</v>

36
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.553
<v Speaker 1>and in a situation like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dominant group is usually the </v>

37
00:01:57.841 --> 00:02:01.170
<v Speaker 1>colonial power or the most influential </v>
<v Speaker 1>trading partner.</v>

38
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.900
<v Speaker 1>Imagine this situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an English speaking.</v>

39
00:02:03.901 --> 00:02:04.734
<v Speaker 1>Colonial power has a sugar plantation </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they bring over at laborers from </v>

40
00:02:08.191 --> 00:02:09.024
<v Speaker 1>various different countries to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>sugar plantation and those people speak </v>

41
00:02:11.941 --> 00:02:14.640
<v Speaker 1>different languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in order to work together,</v>

42
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.090
<v Speaker 1>they need to have a common language so </v>
<v Speaker 1>they try to adopt English,</v>

43
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.030
<v Speaker 1>but since they do this quickly and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>just adopt the basics,</v>

44
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.540
<v Speaker 1>the resulting language is a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>simplified language.</v>

45
00:02:24.541 --> 00:02:25.374
<v Speaker 1>Just using the basic vocabulary of </v>
<v Speaker 1>English and a very non English grammar </v>

46
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.710
<v Speaker 1>that is a pidgin language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When pigeons first developed,</v>

47
00:02:34.711 --> 00:02:35.544
<v Speaker 1>they are typically restricted in use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning that they are only used for a </v>

48
00:02:38.581 --> 00:02:40.080
<v Speaker 1>certain purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

49
00:02:40.081 --> 00:02:40.914
<v Speaker 1>on the job or for trade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but something pigeons become expanded </v>

50
00:02:43.981 --> 00:02:44.814
<v Speaker 1>pigeons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning that they begin to be used for </v>

51
00:02:46.441 --> 00:02:48.810
<v Speaker 1>all facets of life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including social life,</v>

52
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.520
<v Speaker 1>family life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things like that,</v>

53
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.830
<v Speaker 1>and they become languages in their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>rights.</v>

54
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.140
<v Speaker 1>Even though they are not native </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>

55
00:02:55.141 --> 00:02:58.260
<v Speaker 1>They are passed down from generation to </v>
<v Speaker 1>generation as lingua.</v>

56
00:02:58.261 --> 00:02:59.094
<v Speaker 1>Franca is amongst people who speak a </v>
<v Speaker 1>different native languages now about </v>

57
00:03:02.741 --> 00:03:06.130
<v Speaker 1>creole languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so pigeons have no native speakers.</v>

58
00:03:06.131 --> 00:03:08.800
<v Speaker 1>They arise because of the need for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lingua Franca,</v>

59
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.933
<v Speaker 1>but if that language survives and </v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes the native language of the next </v>

60
00:03:13.091 --> 00:03:15.970
<v Speaker 1>generation than it is now a creole </v>
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>

61
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.193
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slaves from several different countries </v>

62
00:03:18.881 --> 00:03:21.310
<v Speaker 1>are working closely together on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>plantation,</v>

63
00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:22.203
<v Speaker 1>but they have no common language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they develop their pigeon and it </v>

64
00:03:24.701 --> 00:03:25.534
<v Speaker 1>quickly becomes their expanded pigeon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the language they use for all everyday </v>

65
00:03:29.051 --> 00:03:29.884
<v Speaker 1>purposes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their children grow up in that </v>

66
00:03:31.271 --> 00:03:32.104
<v Speaker 1>environment with that pigeon language </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it becomes their native language </v>

67
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.943
<v Speaker 1>that is now a creole language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the days when African slaves were </v>

68
00:03:39.041 --> 00:03:39.874
<v Speaker 1>brought to the Americas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were often separated from people </v>

69
00:03:42.251 --> 00:03:44.020
<v Speaker 1>who spoke the same native language.</v>

70
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.770
<v Speaker 1>That was to prevent them from rebelling </v>
<v Speaker 1>or from making plans together,</v>

71
00:03:47.771 --> 00:03:50.350
<v Speaker 1>that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in those kinds of situations,</v>

72
00:03:50.351 --> 00:03:51.184
<v Speaker 1>the pidgin languages became expanded </v>
<v Speaker 1>very quickly and within one generation </v>

73
00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.090
<v Speaker 1>sometimes became creoles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some creoles are based on English,</v>

74
00:03:58.091 --> 00:03:59.880
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamaican Creole,</v>

75
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.100
<v Speaker 1>some creoles are based on French,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including Haitian Creole,</v>

76
00:04:03.101 --> 00:04:03.934
<v Speaker 1>which has 12 million native speakers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the smaller number of creole </v>

77
00:04:06.791 --> 00:04:10.450
<v Speaker 1>languages are based on Spanish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including Chava in Philippines.</v>

78
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.910
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how different are these creole languages</v>

79
00:04:12.911 --> 00:04:14.500
<v Speaker 1>from their parent languages?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

80
00:04:14.501 --> 00:04:17.590
<v Speaker 1>it depends on the particular language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's look at an example.</v>

81
00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:18.453
<v Speaker 1>This example is from Bislama,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is an English based creole spoken </v>

82
00:04:21.581 --> 00:04:23.800
<v Speaker 1>to you in Vanuatu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first sentence is,</v>

83
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.903
<v Speaker 1>this is my house in Bislama,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heavier house belong me or in more </v>

84
00:04:28.571 --> 00:04:30.580
<v Speaker 1>standard English phonology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kim here,</v>

85
00:04:30.581 --> 00:04:33.670
<v Speaker 1>house belong me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another example sentence.</v>

86
00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:34.713
<v Speaker 1>I have already been to town in Bislama </v>
<v Speaker 1>me been longterm fitness or in standard </v>

87
00:04:39.701 --> 00:04:40.570
<v Speaker 1>English phonology.</v>

88
00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.910
<v Speaker 1>Me being that long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the town's finish.</v>

89
00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.270
<v Speaker 1>So look at each word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meat is like I been.</v>

90
00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:47.163
<v Speaker 1>That's self explanatory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Long is used as a preposition here </v>

91
00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.230
<v Speaker 1>instead of an adjective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so long means toward or two.</v>

92
00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:54.483
<v Speaker 1>And then we have town that's like town </v>
<v Speaker 1>and finish finishes used instead of </v>

93
00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.520
<v Speaker 1>already to show that something has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>accomplished.</v>

94
00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:01.623
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see that the words are from </v>

95
00:05:02.921 --> 00:05:03.754
<v Speaker 1>English,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're used and arranged in a very </v>

96
00:05:05.141 --> 00:05:05.974
<v Speaker 1>different way and this is what makes it </v>
<v Speaker 1>a different language than the parent </v>

97
00:05:08.741 --> 00:05:09.574
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pigeons and creoles are fascinating </v>

98
00:05:11.501 --> 00:05:12.334
<v Speaker 1>because they are proof that languages </v>
<v Speaker 1>are living entities that are constantly </v>

99
00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.160
<v Speaker 1>changing and adapting to the needs of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their speakers.</v>

100
00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:19.203
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes two or more languages can even</v>
<v Speaker 1>join forces and take on a life of their </v>

101
00:05:22.751 --> 00:05:25.870
<v Speaker 1>own as a new language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for watching.</v>

102
00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.350
<v Speaker 1>Be sure to leave your comments down </v>
<v Speaker 1>below and have a nice</v>

103
00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.360
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>
