00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.590
<v Speaker 1>Mickey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what to do.</v>

2
00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.040
<v Speaker 1>I really need my viewers to think that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm amazing with languages.</v>

3
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm really not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I need them to think that,</v>

4
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.280
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't need their validation,</v>

5
00:00:21.281 --> 00:00:24.190
<v Speaker 1>but they're always asking me if I am a </v>
<v Speaker 1>super polyglot,</v>

6
00:00:24.191 --> 00:00:25.990
<v Speaker 1>like all those people selling ebooks,</v>

7
00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.450
<v Speaker 2>but how do I get rid of attachments,</v>

8
00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:44.690
<v Speaker 1>but I might fail.</v>

9
00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.153
<v Speaker 1>Hello language enthusiasts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today I'm going to play the great </v>

10
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.920
<v Speaker 1>language game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This idea is totally original.</v>

11
00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.720
<v Speaker 1>I didn't get this idea from Pewdiepie or</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jack's,</v>

12
00:01:05.721 --> 00:01:07.230
<v Speaker 1>but I see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

13
00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.073
<v Speaker 1>I had this idea of long before them in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this game I'll hear some samples of </v>

14
00:01:11.561 --> 00:01:14.800
<v Speaker 1>languages and I will have to guess what </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages they are.</v>

15
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.903
<v Speaker 1>At the end of the game I'll get a score </v>
<v Speaker 1>that reflects my ability to guests the </v>

16
00:01:18.881 --> 00:01:19.714
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is kind of like the mystery </v>

17
00:01:21.581 --> 00:01:24.910
<v Speaker 1>languages videos that I've made,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like these ones right here,</v>

18
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.060
<v Speaker 1>except that I'll be guessing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages instead of you,</v>

19
00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.350
<v Speaker 1>so I'm ready to fail and embarrass </v>
<v Speaker 1>myself for your entertainment.</v>

20
00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.410
<v Speaker 1>Let's go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

21
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.740
<v Speaker 1>here it is the great language game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm clicking play right?</v>

22
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:39.633
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

23
00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.780
<v Speaker 3>anecdotally what I want you in and when </v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

24
00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.973
<v Speaker 3>no meter.</v>

25
00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.940
<v Speaker 1>She the sound quality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get any worse</v>

26
00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.190

<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

27
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.280
<v Speaker 1>You got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

28
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:02.240
<v Speaker 1>That wasn't too hard.</v>

29
00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.650
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cool.</v>

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.450
<v Speaker 5>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Choreograph production assistant.</v>

31
00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.770
<v Speaker 5>So for just two boys,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the boys were either three,</v>

32
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.380
<v Speaker 5>but see Miss Tula.</v>

33
00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.710
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this one's finished.</v>

34
00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.110
<v Speaker 1>I really don't know the sounds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>finished that well,</v>

35
00:02:20.111 --> 00:02:22.180

36
00:02:22.181 --> 00:02:24.940
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't Vietnamese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So by process of elimination,</v>

37
00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.020
<v Speaker 1>I know it's finished.</v>

38

43
00:02:44.011 --> 00:02:44.771

<v Speaker 1>Korean visitors,</v>

45
00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.960
<v Speaker 1>so I know a few words and I know the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sounds of Korean.</v>

46
00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:51.453
<v Speaker 1>That's this one.</v>

73
00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:38.673
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't sound Russian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know specifically what the </v>

74
00:04:42.251 --> 00:04:43.084
<v Speaker 1>difference is,</v>

75
00:04:46.031 --> 00:04:48.880
<v Speaker 1>Polish so I'm going to say Polish </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it sounds Slavic,</v>

76
00:04:48.881 --> 00:04:51.100
<v Speaker 1>but not rushing to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be wrong.</v>

77

<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

161
00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:26.840
<v Speaker 1>I think that once Swahili,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't sound like any of the others.</v>

162
00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:30.350
<v Speaker 1>And something about the tone bursts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sounded Swahili to me.</v>

163
00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:32.300
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

164
00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:33.133
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

165
00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:35.710
<v Speaker 1>Got It.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Next</v>

166
00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:44.550
<v Speaker 15>that I am as they do that.</v>
<v Speaker 15>Also a human that I watched Steve.</v>

167
00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:48.430
<v Speaker 15>Lovely.</v>
<v Speaker 15>It was a big stone.</v>

168
00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:53.280
<v Speaker 15>The COC mass shootings.</v>

169
00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:55.450
<v Speaker 1>Who I'm getting tired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to focus.</v>

170
00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:56.343
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

171
00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:03.870
<v Speaker 15>Steve was big on the COC.</v>
<v Speaker 15>Mass shooting goes,</v>

172
00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:08.030
<v Speaker 15>a capitation went out of their mouths.</v>

173
00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:11.400
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

174
00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:17.680
<v Speaker 1>I think it's Uzbek mainly because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't sound like any of the others.</v>

175
00:10:18.171 --> 00:10:22.850
<v Speaker 1>And some of the pronunciation sounded </v>
<v Speaker 1>like it had Russian influence and I know</v>

176
00:10:22.851 --> 00:10:25.880
<v Speaker 1>that it was Becca.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stan has been influenced by Russia.</v>

177
00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:28.800
<v Speaker 1>So let's say it was bag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

178
00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:30.120
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was right.</v>

179
00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:33.750
<v Speaker 1>I've only got one life left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is nerve rattling.</v>

180
00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:39.970
<v Speaker 14>Newer Kumba be slamming state.</v>
<v Speaker 14>No secret was Sunni initially out of the</v>

<v Speaker 14>but the dod.</v>

183
00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:52.360
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

184
00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.140
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some,</v>

185
00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:55.143
<v Speaker 1>I heard some words that sounded like </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were borrowed from Arabic and </v>

186
00:10:57.221 --> 00:10:58.054
<v Speaker 1>they've retained the Arabic </v>
<v Speaker 1>pronunciation and I know that's why he </v>

187
00:11:00.711 --> 00:11:03.340
<v Speaker 1>really has some Arabic words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that helped me to guest</v>
