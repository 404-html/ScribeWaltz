00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.790
<v Speaker 1>Hey look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found this book called Kinky Japanese.</v>

2
00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:06.670
<v Speaker 1>I guess this is all Hentai stuff or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

3
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.333
<v Speaker 1>Hey guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>today I'm going to answer a question </v>

4
00:00:15.781 --> 00:00:16.614
<v Speaker 1>that I wanted to ask them that a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are beginners at Japanese </v>

5
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.293
<v Speaker 1>often asking it's should I learn a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Japanese dialect from the beginning or </v>

6
00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:26.124
<v Speaker 1>should I just focus on the standard </v>
<v Speaker 1>language in my answer to that is </v>

7
00:00:29.611 --> 00:00:32.760
<v Speaker 1>basically you should focus on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>standard language.</v>

8
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.103
<v Speaker 1>Before I came to Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was planning to come to the kinky </v>

9
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.510
<v Speaker 1>region or the Kansai region.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is also known,</v>

10
00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.690
<v Speaker 1>that's the area around Osaka and Kyoto </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Kobe.</v>

11
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.230
<v Speaker 1>I was planning to come to this region </v>
<v Speaker 1>already.</v>

12
00:00:46.231 --> 00:00:49.110
<v Speaker 1>So I knew that I would be encountering </v>
<v Speaker 1>the local dialect.</v>

13
00:00:49.111 --> 00:00:49.944
<v Speaker 1>So I bought this book because I wanted </v>
<v Speaker 1>to know some of the dialect beforehand </v>

14
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.833
<v Speaker 1>and then I got here and I'll tell you my</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience and what happened once I got </v>

15
00:00:57.901 --> 00:00:59.370
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically,</v>

16
00:00:59.371 --> 00:01:02.070
<v Speaker 1>I think you should focus on the standard</v>
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>

17
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.923
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because because the dialects are just </v>

18
00:01:05.641 --> 00:01:09.510
<v Speaker 1>not really a big deal in Japan anymore </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the Japanese language,</v>

19
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.430
<v Speaker 1>they were like 100 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

20
00:01:11.431 --> 00:01:12.264
<v Speaker 1>the dialects were quite different than </v>
<v Speaker 1>people would have to try really hard to </v>

21
00:01:15.571 --> 00:01:17.640
<v Speaker 1>communicate with speakers from other </v>
<v Speaker 1>dialects.</v>

22
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.473
<v Speaker 1>But now basically everyone speaks </v>
<v Speaker 1>standard Japanese with some components </v>

23
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.950
<v Speaker 1>of the dialect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they've become much more standard in</v>

24
00:01:25.951 --> 00:01:27.140
<v Speaker 1>recent generations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

25
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.080
<v Speaker 1>through education and through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

26
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.173
<v Speaker 1>the media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the national media that's based in </v>

27
00:01:31.291 --> 00:01:32.124
<v Speaker 1>Tokyo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are learning the standard </v>

28
00:01:33.541 --> 00:01:35.730
<v Speaker 1>language and that's becoming the model </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they,</v>

29
00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:36.723
<v Speaker 1>they copy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the exceptions are when you meet </v>

30
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.133
<v Speaker 1>elderly people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll often speak like a heavier </v>

31
00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:44.190
<v Speaker 1>dialect and they might say a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>dialect words.</v>

32
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.890
<v Speaker 1>When a younger person would use the </v>
<v Speaker 1>standard words,</v>

33
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.133
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also true sometimes in working </v>

34
00:01:50.941 --> 00:01:51.774
<v Speaker 1>class neighborhoods or with less </v>
<v Speaker 1>educated people and also deeper in the </v>

35
00:01:55.861 --> 00:01:56.694
<v Speaker 1>countryside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will hear more of the dialect as </v>

36
00:01:58.651 --> 00:01:59.484
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But basically with the younger </v>

37
00:02:00.301 --> 00:02:02.730
<v Speaker 1>generations that mainstream Japanese </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

38
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.770
<v Speaker 1>they speak mostly the standard language </v>
<v Speaker 1>with some bits of the dialect mixed in.</v>

39
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.440
<v Speaker 1>So it's not really essential that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn those bits,</v>

40
00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more essential that you learned the</v>

41
00:02:12.661 --> 00:02:13.494
<v Speaker 1>foundation of Japanese have standard </v>
<v Speaker 1>Japanese and then once you're here you </v>

42
00:02:17.851 --> 00:02:18.684
<v Speaker 1>will just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll pick up some of the elements of </v>

43
00:02:20.551 --> 00:02:23.940
<v Speaker 1>the dialect from your environment and </v>
<v Speaker 1>through your casual interactions.</v>

44
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.130
<v Speaker 1>So it's not really critical that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>study it.</v>

45
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.130
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to avoid the dialect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

46
00:02:29.131 --> 00:02:32.010
<v Speaker 1>I bought this book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I use this just basically,</v>

47
00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.153
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just as a supplement just for fun just </v>

48
00:02:34.681 --> 00:02:36.930
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to get familiar with the bit of the</v>

49
00:02:36.931 --> 00:02:38.670
<v Speaker 1>dialect before I came here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was good.</v>

50
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.920
<v Speaker 1>It was a good idea because once I got </v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

51
00:02:40.921 --> 00:02:43.320
<v Speaker 1>I understood those dialect elements when</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard them.</v>

52
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.330
<v Speaker 1>But that's just as an extra supplement </v>
<v Speaker 1>for fun and for familiarization,</v>

53
00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would focus on the standard language.</v>

54
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.710
<v Speaker 1>So the direction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a big deal.</v>

55
00:02:52.711 --> 00:02:56.130
<v Speaker 1>That's one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A second reason is that people will just</v>

56
00:02:56.131 --> 00:02:56.964
<v Speaker 1>tend to speak to you and standard </v>
<v Speaker 1>Japanese anyway because you're a 400 </v>

57
00:02:59.621 --> 00:03:00.454
<v Speaker 1>learning Japanese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they will simplify and standardize </v>

58
00:03:03.311 --> 00:03:04.144
<v Speaker 1>their language to try to help you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you won't hear the dialect being </v>

59
00:03:07.181 --> 00:03:09.670
<v Speaker 1>spoken to you directly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that often,</v>

60
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:10.563
<v Speaker 1>unless it's like an elderly person or </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe someone in the countryside or </v>

61
00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:13.984
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most people will speak to you in </v>

62
00:03:16.031 --> 00:03:20.320
<v Speaker 1>standard language and wherever you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you speak the standard language,</v>

63
00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.010
<v Speaker 1>they'll be able to speak it back to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless it's one of those types of people</v>

64
00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.470
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned they might not be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>with that said,</v>

65
00:03:26.471 --> 00:03:27.304
<v Speaker 1>it's a good idea to learn some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dialect before you come here and to </v>

66
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.360
<v Speaker 1>familiarize yourself with it just </v>
<v Speaker 1>passively.</v>

67
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.630
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to practice producing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>dialects or I'm getting fluent and using</v>

68
00:03:40.541 --> 00:03:42.610
<v Speaker 1>the dialect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to do that.</v>

69
00:03:42.611 --> 00:03:43.444
<v Speaker 1>You just a book like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which just basically introduces some of </v>

70
00:03:46.721 --> 00:03:50.590
<v Speaker 1>the words and shows them in context is </v>
<v Speaker 1>good just just for passive learning.</v>

71
00:03:50.591 --> 00:03:51.424
<v Speaker 1>So you'll know it when you hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then over time as you live in that </v>

72
00:03:54.161 --> 00:03:54.994
<v Speaker 1>location,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will incorporate some of those </v>

73
00:03:57.401 --> 00:04:01.690
<v Speaker 1>elements of the dialect into your </v>
<v Speaker 1>natural speech in the right situations.</v>

74
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:02.760
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

75
00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:03.603
<v Speaker 1>so just just do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Focus on the standard language and have </v>

76
00:04:07.061 --> 00:04:07.894
<v Speaker 1>some fun learning a bit of the dialect </v>
<v Speaker 1>and over time it will become part of </v>

77
00:04:10.931 --> 00:04:13.180
<v Speaker 1>your Japanese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's my advice.</v>

78
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.560
<v Speaker 1>I hope that's helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

79
00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:15.580
<v Speaker 1>talk to you later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bye.</v>
