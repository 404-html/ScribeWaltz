00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.610
<v Speaker 1>Philippians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love the Philippines.</v>

2
00:00:02.611 --> 00:00:03.444
<v Speaker 1>I've been there three times already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm probably going there for a fourth </v>

3
00:00:06.181 --> 00:00:11.181
<v Speaker 1>time pretty soon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good evening everyone.</v>

4
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.050
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to my office space slash </v>
<v Speaker 1>language lab.</v>

5
00:00:19.051 --> 00:00:19.884
<v Speaker 1>This is where I do my work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is where I study when I'm studying </v>

6
00:00:23.101 --> 00:00:24.310
<v Speaker 1>a language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

7
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.080
<v Speaker 1>and I wanted to talk to you about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

8
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.013
<v Speaker 1>the next language that I'm thinking of </v>
<v Speaker 1>picking up the language or the main </v>

9
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.100
<v Speaker 1>national language of this place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is Philippians.</v>

10
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.430
<v Speaker 1>I love the Philippines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been there three times already.</v>

11
00:00:38.431 --> 00:00:41.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm probably going there for a fourth </v>
<v Speaker 1>time pretty soon,</v>

12
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.770
<v Speaker 1>so I thought it might be fun to learn a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>

13
00:00:43.771 --> 00:00:47.070
<v Speaker 1>It's a catalog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't actually have to really learn it</v>

14
00:00:47.071 --> 00:00:51.990
<v Speaker 1>because most people in Philippines speak</v>
<v Speaker 1>English really quite well.</v>

15
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.093
<v Speaker 1>Not everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most people speak English well </v>

16
00:00:55.261 --> 00:00:57.000
<v Speaker 1>enough that I don't need to learn </v>
<v Speaker 1>tagalog,</v>

17
00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.893
<v Speaker 1>but if I'm going to spend that much time</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Philippines then it would make </v>

18
00:01:01.621 --> 00:01:05.040
<v Speaker 1>sense to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to try to learn some of the language and</v>

19
00:01:05.041 --> 00:01:07.500
<v Speaker 1>just have some fun with it and see how </v>
<v Speaker 1>far they take it.</v>

20
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:08.633
<v Speaker 1>My main project right now is French,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so tagalog catalogs not going to be my </v>

21
00:01:12.091 --> 00:01:14.220
<v Speaker 1>main thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I want it to give it a go,</v>

22
00:01:14.221 --> 00:01:16.890
<v Speaker 1>have some fun with it and if I go back </v>
<v Speaker 1>there numerous times,</v>

23
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:17.753
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'll study and improve a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit each time and just have that basic </v>

24
00:01:21.691 --> 00:01:25.170
<v Speaker 1>knowledge I can use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's have a look at how I'm going to</v>

25
00:01:25.171 --> 00:01:26.220
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where I'm going to start.</v>

26
00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:28.713
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to jump right into my </v>

27
00:01:30.271 --> 00:01:32.910
<v Speaker 1>computer just like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.</v>

28
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.150
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here we are inside my computer.</v>

29
00:01:36.151 --> 00:01:41.110
<v Speaker 1>You can see I'm on a page right here </v>
<v Speaker 1>with this image of a pimsleur program.</v>

30
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.993
<v Speaker 1>This is pimsleur Tagalog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pimsleur is a language course that is </v>

31
00:01:45.121 --> 00:01:47.970
<v Speaker 1>all audio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't use any text.</v>

32
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.880
<v Speaker 1>Usually you don't learn the grammar </v>
<v Speaker 1>explicitly.</v>

33
00:01:50.881 --> 00:01:51.714
<v Speaker 1>You just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

34
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.470
<v Speaker 1>you learned through listening and </v>
<v Speaker 1>responding and repeating with the CD.</v>

35
00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.160
<v Speaker 1>Now it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they market it really heavily and they,</v>

36
00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.730
<v Speaker 1>they talked like this one program will </v>
<v Speaker 1>make you fluent and stuff,</v>

37
00:02:02.731 --> 00:02:03.564
<v Speaker 1>but it's not the be all end all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I really like to use some kind of </v>

38
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.410
<v Speaker 1>audio program at the beginning when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>start learning a language because I want</v>

39
00:02:10.411 --> 00:02:13.260
<v Speaker 1>to get familiar with the phonology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sounds,</v>

40
00:02:13.261 --> 00:02:14.094
<v Speaker 1>the pronunciation quite quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both for understanding them and for </v>

41
00:02:17.791 --> 00:02:19.900
<v Speaker 1>producing them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

42
00:02:19.901 --> 00:02:23.220
<v Speaker 1>so I like to get some program like this </v>
<v Speaker 1>so I can focus on the cds,</v>

43
00:02:23.221 --> 00:02:25.290
<v Speaker 1>learn them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go over them a few times if I need to.</v>

44
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.720
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this one is 30 lessons,</v>

45
00:02:27.721 --> 00:02:31.230
<v Speaker 1>so it usually takes like a month if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>do one lesson per day.</v>

46
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.513
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but after I do the first couple of </v>

47
00:02:34.561 --> 00:02:36.870
<v Speaker 1>lessons and just get familiar with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>basic sounds,</v>

48
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.840
<v Speaker 1>then I'm going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll keep doing this program.</v>

49
00:02:39.841 --> 00:02:43.740
<v Speaker 1>But after the first couple of lessons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to find a teacher so I can get</v>

50
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.010
<v Speaker 1>some more practice producing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>language and using it a building my oral</v>

51
00:02:49.561 --> 00:02:50.730
<v Speaker 1>communication skills.</v>

52
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.920
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to use something called Iot</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talky,</v>

53
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.023
<v Speaker 1>which is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a website that matches you with </v>

54
00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.800
<v Speaker 1>tutors or teachers of the language want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to learn.</v>

55
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.680
<v Speaker 1>So there's a scroll down the list here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a dropdown menu.</v>

56
00:03:02.681 --> 00:03:04.960
<v Speaker 1>You can find the language of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>choice.</v>

57
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.853
<v Speaker 1>Here is fulfilled Pino or Tagalog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's click on that and I want </v>

58
00:03:09.101 --> 00:03:12.910
<v Speaker 1>someone who also speaks English.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's most people in Philippines,</v>

59
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.780
<v Speaker 1>so let's browse and see how many </v>
<v Speaker 1>teachers are available.</v>

60
00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.433
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could see there are a lots of Gallo </v>

61
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.930
<v Speaker 1>teachers available and the prices are </v>
<v Speaker 1>very good.</v>

62
00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.670
<v Speaker 1>Fit for this is like five to $10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is $5 per hour.</v>

63
00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.870
<v Speaker 1>This woman charges six to $9 per hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically about $5 per hour.</v>

64
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:42.300
<v Speaker 1>So the prices are awesome because </v>
<v Speaker 1>Philippines is a developing country,</v>

65
00:03:42.401 --> 00:03:43.234
<v Speaker 1>so to them maybe that's good money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's important to point out that </v>

66
00:03:47.081 --> 00:03:48.220
<v Speaker 1>these are our tutors.</v>

67
00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.850
<v Speaker 1>They're not always professional teachers</v>
<v Speaker 1>who give you a structured lesson,</v>

68
00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.730
<v Speaker 1>but that's what I want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want someone to practice speaking with</v>

69
00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:55.623
<v Speaker 1>just so I can practice making sentences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>practice getting exposure to the </v>

70
00:03:59.021 --> 00:04:04.021
<v Speaker 1>language that I hear and can produce it </v>
<v Speaker 1>with someone and see if they understand.</v>

71
00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.270
<v Speaker 1>So it's all about building oral </v>
<v Speaker 1>communication skills.</v>

72
00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.970
<v Speaker 1>So step one is get familiar with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sound.</v>

73
00:04:09.971 --> 00:04:10.804
<v Speaker 1>Step two is find a teacher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Start to produce the language and use </v>

74
00:04:12.971 --> 00:04:16.990
<v Speaker 1>the sounds and learn to understand them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a speaking situation,</v>

75
00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:20.650
<v Speaker 1>another resource I'm going to use is </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

76
00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.830
<v Speaker 1>this is the lonely planet Filipino or </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tagalog phrase book.</v>

77
00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:26.553
<v Speaker 1>I really liked using phrase books when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>start learning a language because they </v>

78
00:04:29.981 --> 00:04:30.814
<v Speaker 1>give me a lot of examples of very simple</v>
<v Speaker 1>basic sentences so it gives me a good </v>

79
00:04:35.171 --> 00:04:36.004
<v Speaker 1>chance to internalize the sentence </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure so I can just go over </v>

80
00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:39.850
<v Speaker 1>examples,</v>
<v Speaker 1>examples,</v>

81
00:04:39.851 --> 00:04:40.684
<v Speaker 1>examples with simple vocabulary and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can start to substitute some of the </v>

82
00:04:44.411 --> 00:04:45.244
<v Speaker 1>words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>change out the words to make my own </v>

83
00:04:46.451 --> 00:04:50.350
<v Speaker 1>sentences following the same pattern of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sentence that's right in front of me</v>

84
00:04:50.351 --> 00:04:51.184
<v Speaker 1>and the book and also you have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>English right next to the language so </v>

85
00:04:54.641 --> 00:04:55.450
<v Speaker 1>you can.</v>

86
00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:56.283
<v Speaker 1>You can compare the sentences and figure</v>
<v Speaker 1>out which words mean what in the other </v>

87
00:04:59.561 --> 00:05:02.080
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that gives you a good sense of how to</v>

88
00:05:02.081 --> 00:05:04.540
<v Speaker 1>build sentences from their component </v>
<v Speaker 1>pieces.</v>

89
00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:05.583
<v Speaker 1>So I really liked to do that phrase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Books are really useful if you use them </v>

90
00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:13.980
<v Speaker 1>correctly in that when I'm also going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>use a more traditional kind of textbook.</v>

91
00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.030
<v Speaker 1>This one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tagalog for beginners.</v>

92
00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:17.163
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to start with the kindle </v>
<v Speaker 1>version just because I want to use it </v>

93
00:05:18.581 --> 00:05:20.800
<v Speaker 1>today and it comes with some audios as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

94
00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:22.570
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I like it,</v>

95
00:05:22.571 --> 00:05:23.404
<v Speaker 1>I'll get the paper back because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>generally don't like to get language </v>

96
00:05:25.841 --> 00:05:27.730
<v Speaker 1>books on kindle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I just want it today,</v>

97
00:05:27.731 --> 00:05:31.030
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This one according to the reviews as the</v>

98
00:05:31.031 --> 00:05:32.200
<v Speaker 1>best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't looked at it,</v>

99
00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.380
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to go for this one because</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the reviews.</v>

100
00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:37.263
<v Speaker 1>I like to have some kind of traditional </v>
<v Speaker 1>textbook when I'm studying a language </v>

101
00:05:40.421 --> 00:05:44.310
<v Speaker 1>because it gives me a bit of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious understanding of,</v>

102
00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:45.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the language.</v>

103
00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.420
<v Speaker 1>So with the phrase book that can just do</v>
<v Speaker 1>it on my own.</v>

104
00:05:49.421 --> 00:05:50.254
<v Speaker 1>I can figure things out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're always going to be times </v>

105
00:05:52.601 --> 00:05:56.890
<v Speaker 1>when I'm somewhat confused or I want </v>
<v Speaker 1>some confirmation of what I'm.</v>

106
00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:58.063
<v Speaker 1>So these traditional textbooks usually </v>
<v Speaker 1>give you the grammar and the vocabulary </v>

107
00:06:01.941 --> 00:06:06.110
<v Speaker 1>and all that with some explanation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>how to use them and what they mean.</v>

108
00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:10.820
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to have those components.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have the pimsleur for,</v>

109
00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:11.883
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting familiar with the sounds of the </v>

110
00:06:13.101 --> 00:06:15.560
<v Speaker 1>pronunciation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I'm going to find a teacher,</v>

111
00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:16.443
<v Speaker 1>start talking right away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I'm going to use the phrase book </v>

112
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:20.923
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to get familiar with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sentence structure and I'm going to do </v>

113
00:06:23.451 --> 00:06:26.900
<v Speaker 1>some traditional learning study a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit in this textbook every day,</v>

114
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:29.000
<v Speaker 1>so those are the things I'm planning to </v>
