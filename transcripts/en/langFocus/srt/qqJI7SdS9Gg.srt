Hello everyone.
Welcome to the Lange focus channel in.

2
00:00:03,031 --> 00:00:03,864
My name is Paul.
Today we're going to talk about the 

3
00:00:05,641 --> 00:00:10,641
language of pigeons.
Sorry,

4
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:13,770
I know that joke isn't very good,
but that's all I've got.

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:15,023
Today.
I'm going to talk about some special 

6
00:00:16,351 --> 00:00:19,380
kinds of languages called pigeons and 
creoles.

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,450
You've probably heard those terms 
before,

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,740
maybe in the names of certain languages 
like pigeon English or Haitian Creole,

9
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:26,693
but please note there is not just a 
single pigeon language or a single 

10
00:00:29,761 --> 00:00:30,594
creole language.
They are actually referring to 

11
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:33,203
categories of languages.
There are many pigeons and many creoles 

12
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,590
around the world.
First,

13
00:00:37,591 --> 00:00:39,090
what do they have in common?
Well,

14
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:39,953
pigeons and creoles are new languages 
that develop when speakers of different 

15
00:00:43,471 --> 00:00:47,190
languages come into contact with each 
other and have a need to communicate.

16
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,233
Many pigeons and creoles have arisen 
when colonial powers came into contact 

17
00:00:51,661 --> 00:00:54,570
with local people as they spread around 
the world.

18
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,420
So what's the difference between pigeons
and creoles?

19
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,370
Well,
pigeons are non native,

20
00:00:59,371 --> 00:01:02,370
Lingua Franca as well.
Creoles have native speakers,

21
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:05,040
but let me get into both types of 
language.

22
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,200
First of all,
Pidgin languages,

23
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,440
as I just mentioned,
Pidgin languages have no native speakers

24
00:01:10,441 --> 00:01:12,750
there.
Languages that arise very suddenly,

25
00:01:12,751 --> 00:01:16,830
very quickly when there is a need for 
communication in a certain situation.

26
00:01:16,831 --> 00:01:19,260
For example,
for trade or for Labor,

27
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,333
the pigeon language is a sort of 
compromise between two different 

28
00:01:22,831 --> 00:01:23,664
languages or between multiple languages.
Pigeons usually arise when one group of 

29
00:01:27,331 --> 00:01:31,560
people is dominant over another group of
people and the less dominant group needs

30
00:01:31,561 --> 00:01:34,350
to learn to communicate with the more 
dominant group,

31
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,340
but without any formal education in the 
language of that dominant group,

32
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:39,413
they adopt the sort of simplified 
language based on the most basic 

33
00:01:42,331 --> 00:01:43,164
vocabulary of that dominant groups 
language and based on the most basic 

34
00:01:46,591 --> 00:01:48,870
grammar of their own native language.

35
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,560
This happens most commonly in situations
of trade slavery or colonial contact,

36
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,553
and in a situation like that,
the dominant group is usually the 

37
00:01:57,841 --> 00:02:01,170
colonial power or the most influential 
trading partner.

38
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,900
Imagine this situation,
an English speaking.

39
00:02:03,901 --> 00:02:04,734
Colonial power has a sugar plantation 
and they bring over at laborers from 

40
00:02:08,191 --> 00:02:09,024
various different countries to that 
sugar plantation and those people speak 

41
00:02:11,941 --> 00:02:14,640
different languages,
but in order to work together,

42
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:18,090
they need to have a common language so 
they try to adopt English,

43
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:21,030
but since they do this quickly and they 
just adopt the basics,

44
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:24,540
the resulting language is a very 
simplified language.

45
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:25,374
Just using the basic vocabulary of 
English and a very non English grammar 

46
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:34,710
that is a pidgin language.
When pigeons first developed,

47
00:02:34,711 --> 00:02:35,544
they are typically restricted in use,
meaning that they are only used for a 

48
00:02:38,581 --> 00:02:40,080
certain purpose,
for example,

49
00:02:40,081 --> 00:02:40,914
on the job or for trade,
but something pigeons become expanded 

50
00:02:43,981 --> 00:02:44,814
pigeons,
meaning that they begin to be used for 

51
00:02:46,441 --> 00:02:48,810
all facets of life,
including social life,

52
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,520
family life,
things like that,

53
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,830
and they become languages in their own 
rights.

54
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,140
Even though they are not native 
languages.

55
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:58,260
They are passed down from generation to 
generation as lingua.

56
00:02:58,261 --> 00:02:59,094
Franca is amongst people who speak a 
different native languages now about 

57
00:03:02,741 --> 00:03:06,130
creole languages,
so pigeons have no native speakers.

58
00:03:06,131 --> 00:03:08,800
They arise because of the need for a 
Lingua Franca,

59
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:09,933
but if that language survives and 
becomes the native language of the next 

60
00:03:13,091 --> 00:03:15,970
generation than it is now a creole 
language,

61
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,193
for example,
slaves from several different countries 

62
00:03:18,881 --> 00:03:21,310
are working closely together on a 
plantation,

63
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:22,203
but they have no common language,
so they develop their pigeon and it 

64
00:03:24,701 --> 00:03:25,534
quickly becomes their expanded pigeon,
the language they use for all everyday 

65
00:03:29,051 --> 00:03:29,884
purposes.
Their children grow up in that 

66
00:03:31,271 --> 00:03:32,104
environment with that pigeon language 
and it becomes their native language 

67
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:35,943
that is now a creole language.
In the days when African slaves were 

68
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:39,874
brought to the Americas,
they were often separated from people 

69
00:03:42,251 --> 00:03:44,020
who spoke the same native language.

70
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:47,770
That was to prevent them from rebelling 
or from making plans together,

71
00:03:47,771 --> 00:03:50,350
that kind of thing.
So in those kinds of situations,

72
00:03:50,351 --> 00:03:51,184
the pidgin languages became expanded 
very quickly and within one generation 

73
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:58,090
sometimes became creoles.
Some creoles are based on English,

74
00:03:58,091 --> 00:03:59,880
for example,
Jamaican Creole,

75
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,100
some creoles are based on French,
including Haitian Creole,

76
00:04:03,101 --> 00:04:03,934
which has 12 million native speakers,
and the smaller number of creole 

77
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:10,450
languages are based on Spanish,
including Chava in Philippines.

78
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:12,910
Now,
how different are these creole languages

79
00:04:12,911 --> 00:04:14,500
from their parent languages?
Well,

80
00:04:14,501 --> 00:04:17,590
it depends on the particular language,
but let's look at an example.

81
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,453
This example is from Bislama,
which is an English based creole spoken 

82
00:04:21,581 --> 00:04:23,800
to you in Vanuatu.
The first sentence is,

83
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:24,903
this is my house in Bislama,
heavier house belong me or in more 

84
00:04:28,571 --> 00:04:30,580
standard English phonology.
Kim here,

85
00:04:30,581 --> 00:04:33,670
house belong me.
Another example sentence.

86
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,713
I have already been to town in Bislama 
me been longterm fitness or in standard 

87
00:04:39,701 --> 00:04:40,570
English phonology.

88
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,910
Me being that long,
the town's finish.

89
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,270
So look at each word.
Meat is like I been.

90
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:47,163
That's self explanatory.
Long is used as a preposition here 

91
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:53,230
instead of an adjective,
so long means toward or two.

92
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:54,483
And then we have town that's like town 
and finish finishes used instead of 

93
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,520
already to show that something has been 
accomplished.

94
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:01,623
So again,
you can see that the words are from 

95
00:05:02,921 --> 00:05:03,754
English,
but they're used and arranged in a very 

96
00:05:05,141 --> 00:05:05,974
different way and this is what makes it 
a different language than the parent 

97
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:09,574
language.
Pigeons and creoles are fascinating 

98
00:05:11,501 --> 00:05:12,334
because they are proof that languages 
are living entities that are constantly 

99
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:18,160
changing and adapting to the needs of 
their speakers.

100
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:19,203
Sometimes two or more languages can even
join forces and take on a life of their 

101
00:05:22,751 --> 00:05:25,870
own as a new language.
Thank you for watching.

102
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,350
Be sure to leave your comments down 
below and have a nice

103
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,360
day.
