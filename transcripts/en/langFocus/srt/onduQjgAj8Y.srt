1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,043
Okay,
so I've had a lot of requests for a 

2
00:00:02,191 --> 00:00:03,024
video on the North Germanic languages,
so today I present to you a video on 

3
00:00:06,631 --> 00:00:08,130
Swedish,
Norwegian,

4
00:00:08,131 --> 00:00:09,660
Danish,
and Finnish.

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:12,913
What?

6
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:17,943
Hello everyone.
Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and 

7
00:00:19,751 --> 00:00:20,584
my name is Paul.
Today I'm going to talk about the north 

8
00:00:22,511 --> 00:00:23,344
Germanic languages of the Nordic nations
that includes the Scandinavian 

9
00:00:26,741 --> 00:00:27,880
languages,
Swedish,

10
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:29,260
Danish,
and Norwegian,

11
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:32,530
and I will also touch on the languages 
of Icelandic and federal.

12
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:33,373
Always.
I wanted to call this video at the 

13
00:00:34,661 --> 00:00:35,494
Scandinavian languages because I just 
love the way that word sounds 

14
00:00:38,021 --> 00:00:40,600
Scandinavian,
but to the people of that region.

15
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:43,420
The word Scandinavian only refers to 
Denmark,

16
00:00:43,421 --> 00:00:44,254
Sweden,
and Norway and not to the other 

17
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:49,510
countries that I want to talk about.
So if I say the Nordic nations,

18
00:00:49,511 --> 00:00:53,110
that also includes Iceland,
the Faroe Islands as well as Finland.

19
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:54,123
I want to talk about the north Germanic 
languages spoken in all of those 

20
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:57,514
countries.
So I decided on the title that North 

21
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,540
Germanic languages of the Nordic 
nations,

22
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:04,810
and please note that finish is not in 
north dramatic language.

23
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,630
It belongs to a separate language family
entirely.

24
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:13,970
There are about 20 million native 
speakers of North Germanic languages and

25
00:01:13,971 --> 00:01:16,790
that includes about 9 million speakers 
of Swedish,

26
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:17,773
mainly in Sweden,
but also as a minority language in 

27
00:01:19,641 --> 00:01:22,070
Finland.
6 million speakers of Danish,

28
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:22,963
mainly in Denmark,
but also as a minority language in the 

29
00:01:25,011 --> 00:01:28,400
southern region of northern Germany and 
in Greenland.

30
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:31,040
5 million speakers of Norwegian,
mainly in Norway.

31
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:33,980
Three hundred and 20,000
speakers of Icelandic,

32
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,960
mainly in Iceland.
90,000

33
00:01:35,961 --> 00:01:38,810
speakers a feral.
We're about two thirds of them living in

34
00:01:38,811 --> 00:01:41,060
the Faroe Islands and the rest of mainly
in Denmark.

35
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:44,090
The North Germanic languages are,
as you probably guessed,

36
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,370
a branch of the Germanic language 
family.

37
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:49,640
All Germanic languages developed from 
Provo Germanic,

38
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:50,503
which was spoken around 500 bce,
portage romantic possibly originated in 

39
00:01:54,441 --> 00:01:55,274
Scandinavia,
and different varieties of Germanic 

40
00:01:57,231 --> 00:01:58,064
began to emerge with migration.
Runic inscriptions from the second 

41
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:01,874
century ce show us that by that time,
pro dramatic had began to separate into 

42
00:02:05,661 --> 00:02:08,540
distinct western,
eastern and northern dialects.

43
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,673
The northern dialect was spoken in 
Scandinavia and is today often referred 

44
00:02:12,621 --> 00:02:13,454
to as pro tow norse and became the 
ancestor of all the north Germanic 

45
00:02:16,911 --> 00:02:17,744
languages.
Poteau northwest spoken from around the 

46
00:02:19,251 --> 00:02:20,084
second century Ce to the eighth century 
CE and by the beginning of the Viking 

47
00:02:23,871 --> 00:02:24,704
era in the eighth century ce,
it had evolved into dialects that are 

48
00:02:27,711 --> 00:02:32,060
collectively referred to as old norse.
During the next few hundred years,

49
00:02:32,061 --> 00:02:32,894
vikings seafaring north people explored 
much of Europe by sea and river 

50
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:37,124
conquering lands and establishing 
settlements and bringing their language 

51
00:02:39,831 --> 00:02:41,540
with them.
During this time,

52
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:42,403
old north was divided into three 
mutually intelligible dialects of old 

53
00:02:45,801 --> 00:02:46,490
east,
north,

54
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:48,620
old west,
north and old goodness.

55
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:49,783
All the east,
northwest spoken in Sweden and Denmark 

56
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,690
as well as their overseas settlements in
Russia,

57
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,150
England,
and in Danish settlements in Normandy,

58
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,000
old West northwest spoken in Norway as 
well.

59
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,003
Its overseas settlements,
the two most notable where Iceland and 

60
00:03:02,381 --> 00:03:04,540
the Faroe Islands,
but also Ireland,

61
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:05,374
Scotland,
and the isle of Man and Norwegian 

62
00:03:07,031 --> 00:03:08,070
settlements in Normandy.

63
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:11,050
Old goodness was mainly spoken on the 
island of Gotland,

64
00:03:11,051 --> 00:03:14,920
which is today part of Sweden as well as
some overseas settlements to the east.

65
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:18,250
These west,
east and goodness varieties of old north

66
00:03:18,251 --> 00:03:22,180
gradually developed into the modern 
north dramatic languages around the 14th

67
00:03:22,181 --> 00:03:23,110
century,
ce,

68
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:26,110
the Western branch of languages consists
of Norwegian,

69
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,003
Icelandic,
and feral weeds as well as some other 

70
00:03:28,811 --> 00:03:29,644
extinct languages.
The eastern branch consists of Swedish 

71
00:03:32,501 --> 00:03:35,260
and Danish.
The goodness branch consists of only the

72
00:03:35,261 --> 00:03:38,860
goodness language which is still spoken 
to some extent on the island of Gotland,

73
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,023
but these days the north dramatic 
languages are generally not thought of 

74
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,260
in terms of east,
west and goodness.

75
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:47,140
They are thought of in terms of 
continental and insular.

76
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,780
The continental languages are Danish,
Swedish,

77
00:03:49,781 --> 00:03:50,614
and Norwegian,
and the insular languages are Icelandic 

78
00:03:52,661 --> 00:03:53,494
and Pharaoh always.
These categories are based on mutual 

79
00:03:55,571 --> 00:03:56,404
intelligibility of the languages rather 
than on the genetic root language that 

80
00:03:59,681 --> 00:04:00,430
they come from.

81
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:04,630
Norwegian is grouped with Swedish and 
Danish because even though Icelandic and

82
00:04:04,631 --> 00:04:05,464
Norwegian developed from the same old 
west North's Norwegian is today much 

83
00:04:08,891 --> 00:04:11,050
more intelligible with Swedish and 
Danish.

84
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,990
One reason for that is the political 
union of Denmark and Norway from 1536 to

85
00:04:16,991 --> 00:04:18,820
1814.
During this time,

86
00:04:18,821 --> 00:04:19,654
the written Norwegian language stopped 
being used and it was replaced by the 

87
00:04:22,361 --> 00:04:23,194
written Danish language and this had a 
big impact on the spoken dialects of 

88
00:04:26,501 --> 00:04:27,334
Norwegian,
especially the central and eastern 

89
00:04:29,051 --> 00:04:31,990
dialects.
The continental languages also underwent

90
00:04:31,991 --> 00:04:34,210
a lot of influence from middle,
low German,

91
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,073
which is an influence that didn't effect
Icelandic and always the three 

92
00:04:38,141 --> 00:04:42,040
continental languages can be referred to
as the Scandinavian languages.

93
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,320
When talking about the Scandinavian 
languages,

94
00:04:44,321 --> 00:04:45,154
it's important to note that there is a 
significant amount of dialectal 

95
00:04:47,381 --> 00:04:50,140
variation within each language.
In fact,

96
00:04:50,141 --> 00:04:52,870
the three languages are made up of a 
dialect continuum.

97
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,940
That means if you travel in one 
direction,

98
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:57,640
the dialects gradually changed.
The further you go.

99
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,720
That means,
for example,

100
00:04:58,721 --> 00:05:01,480
that if you are Norwegian living near 
the border with Sweden,

101
00:05:01,481 --> 00:05:02,314
you probably have an easier time 
understanding your neighbor just across 

102
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:05,613
the border and Sweden.
Then you do a Norwegian from the other 

103
00:05:07,631 --> 00:05:08,464
side of the country.
Even though you are supposedly speaking 

104
00:05:10,901 --> 00:05:12,760
a different language from that Swedish 
person.

105
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:13,773
This makes it kind of hard to determine 
at what point these dialects become 

106
00:05:16,301 --> 00:05:19,420
different languages or if they are in 
fact different languages at all.

107
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,313
The three languages are all more or less
intelligible depending on where the 

108
00:05:23,111 --> 00:05:23,944
dialect lies on that continuum and the 
written languages are almost entirely 

109
00:05:27,281 --> 00:05:28,114
intelligible.
Danish seems to be the odd man out with 

110
00:05:30,341 --> 00:05:31,174
its complex phonology that has come to 
be quite distinct from the written 

111
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:34,834
language.
Swedes and Norwegians often say that 

112
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:39,610
Danish people sound like they're 
speaking with a potato in their mouth.

113
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:43,000
I can't actually confirm if they do 
speak with a potato in their mouth,

114
00:05:43,001 --> 00:05:43,834
so scandinavians,
can you let me know if that's true in 

115
00:05:45,581 --> 00:05:47,740
the comments down below,
I have Danish roots,

116
00:05:47,741 --> 00:05:50,230
so I'm allowed to make fun of Dan's.
From what I understand,

117
00:05:50,231 --> 00:05:53,950
Norwegians have the easiest time 
understanding the other two Scandinavian

118
00:05:53,951 --> 00:05:54,784
languages,
though they understand Swedish better 

119
00:05:56,141 --> 00:05:56,974
than Danish.
Swedes can generally understand or we 

120
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,023
join,
but they have much more trouble 

121
00:06:00,831 --> 00:06:03,290
understanding Danish because of its 
pronunciation,

122
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:04,573
and Danes can more or less understand 
Norwegian and to a lesser extent they 

123
00:06:07,551 --> 00:06:10,250
can understand some Swedish.
From what I understand,

124
00:06:10,251 --> 00:06:13,640
Scandinavians will generally not speak 
the other person's language.

125
00:06:13,641 --> 00:06:17,450
They will speak their own language while
making an effort to understand the other

126
00:06:17,451 --> 00:06:21,500
person's speech and maybe they will slow
down and clarify things when necessary,

127
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:24,290
but when they have significant trouble 
communicating,

128
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:25,124
they might switch to English,
which isn't that tough for them because 

129
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:30,800
Scandinavians are magical geniuses when 
it comes to learning English.

130
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:31,783
In this kind of situation where you have
three closely related languages that 

131
00:06:34,491 --> 00:06:35,324
kind of blended together on a continuum,
the languages are not defined by the 

132
00:06:38,391 --> 00:06:39,224
spoken variety,
but rather by the official standard 

133
00:06:41,271 --> 00:06:43,820
language associated with that country or
region.

134
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:44,863
In Denmark there is standard Danish.
In Sweden there is standard Swedish and 

135
00:06:48,251 --> 00:06:50,990
in Norway there is standard Norwegian or
wait,

136
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:51,853
no,
there are actually two standard 

137
00:06:52,761 --> 00:06:53,594
Norwegians.

138
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:55,743
That's right.
Norway actually has two official 

139
00:06:57,221 --> 00:06:58,054
standard written languages mall,
which means book language is a Danish 

140
00:07:03,391 --> 00:07:06,900
influenced standard language which is 
very close to standard Danish,

141
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:10,560
but which uses Norwegian pronunciation 
or new.

142
00:07:10,561 --> 00:07:11,394
Norwegian is intended to be a purer 
version of Norwegian based on Norway's 

143
00:07:15,181 --> 00:07:17,100
more conservative Western dialects,

144
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,220
which standard language Norwegians are 
educated in.

145
00:07:20,221 --> 00:07:24,060
Depends on the region they grow up in,
but despite having two official standard

146
00:07:24,061 --> 00:07:26,580
languages,
Norwegians don't really speak them.

147
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,533
Norwegians generally speak their own 
local dialect whenever they are 

148
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,074
speaking,
even in formal situations and even when 

149
00:07:32,821 --> 00:07:33,654
they're speaking to people from the 
other Scandinavian countries because of 

150
00:07:36,061 --> 00:07:36,894
this Norwegians have to get used to 
understanding a wide variety of spoken 

151
00:07:39,961 --> 00:07:40,794
dialects and that's probably part of 
what makes it easier for them to 

152
00:07:42,901 --> 00:07:43,734
understand Swedish and Danish,
but that of course is just my 

153
00:07:46,021 --> 00:07:47,670
speculation.
So native speakers,

154
00:07:47,671 --> 00:07:48,504
you can confirm or disconfirm that.
So let's take a look at the three 

155
00:07:51,301 --> 00:07:54,180
continental languages and see just how 
similar they are

156
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,120
in English.
I love you first and Swedish

157
00:07:58,740 --> 00:07:59,720
got bang

158
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:05,190
now in Norwegian.
Now in Danish it was good.

159
00:08:05,221 --> 00:08:05,770
I,

160
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:07,840
as you can see,
these sentences are very similar,

161
00:08:07,841 --> 00:08:11,050
but with some differences in spelling 
and pronunciation in particular,

162
00:08:11,051 --> 00:08:11,884
the Swedish pronunciation is a little 
different from the other to listen to 

163
00:08:14,231 --> 00:08:15,380
the first person singular

164
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:16,243
pronoun.
Again,

165
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:21,870
yours at the end of the Swedish one,
you can hear a hard g sound.

166
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,083
It's not always pronounced that way.
It depends on exactly where the speaker 

167
00:08:25,161 --> 00:08:27,560
is from.
Another example,

168
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:30,500
dogs are the best pets first and 
Swedish.

169
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,550
Who's the best

170
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:38,800
next in Norwegian?
Who knows the best to share with you and

171
00:08:38,801 --> 00:08:41,290
in Danish,
who knew a diversity?

172
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,233
Kayla,
do you.

173
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,553
Here we see some more noticeable 
differences even though the sentences 

174
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:46,524
are still really similar.
Notice the difference in the world for 

175
00:08:48,241 --> 00:08:49,074
dogs

176
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:53,120
who knew,
who knew the Swedish word is pretty much

177
00:08:53,121 --> 00:08:55,970
pronounced as written,
but in the Norwegian and Danish words,

178
00:08:55,971 --> 00:08:59,520
some letters are not pronounced and 
notice the different words for pets.

179
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:04,853
The Swedish word is different from the 
other two and the Norwegian and Danish 

180
00:09:07,411 --> 00:09:08,244
words are almost the same,
but with a different initial sound and 

181
00:09:10,501 --> 00:09:12,960
slightly different vowels.
Another example,

182
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:15,390
tomorrow I will go to Germany.
In Swedish

183
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,290
your computer

184
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:19,653
and in Norwegian you mourn Scalia Club 
and in Danish you mourn scaleio to 

185
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:26,230
Scotland.
In this case,

186
00:09:26,231 --> 00:09:28,810
the Norwegian and Danish sentences are 
basically the same,

187
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:31,270
but the sweetest sentences pronounced a 
little differently.

188
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:33,490
Again,
we hear those hard g sounds which aren't

189
00:09:33,491 --> 00:09:35,560
present in the Norwegian and Danish 
sentences,

190
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,450
but again,
they're not always pronounced in Swedish

191
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:40,060
either.
One more example in English,

192
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,510
the party was fun because I liked the 
music first in Swedish,

193
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,760
that's pretty young

194
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:52,090
than in Norwegian for the elite and then
Danish first show for de Kooning Seton,

195
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:00,620
and these sentences,
that preferred word for fun is different

196
00:10:00,621 --> 00:10:05,621
in each language.
So the word meaning because there's also

197
00:10:05,841 --> 00:10:08,360
different in Swedish and Norwegian and 
Danish.

198
00:10:08,361 --> 00:10:09,194
It's spelled the same but pronounced 
differently and light is expressed 

199
00:10:15,051 --> 00:10:20,030
differently in all three languages or 
the ladder with the hard g sound,

200
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:24,590
more like the voice in the recording who
newly in Danish.

201
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:26,750
It's expressed in two words.
The first one,

202
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:27,584
meaning could the phrase literally means
could suffer and listen to the 

203
00:10:31,011 --> 00:10:33,740
difference for the word for music in 
Norwegian and Danish.

204
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:36,140
Listen to how the case sound disappears 
in Danish.

205
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,303
And the second was Seton.
And listen to the pronunciation of this 

206
00:10:40,251 --> 00:10:41,410
phrase again.
Uh,

207
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:44,420
so the end of the second word seems to 
vanish.

208
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:47,330
This could be part of that potato 
phenomenon discussed earlier.

209
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:48,733
You can probably see just how similar 
these three languages are and you can 

210
00:10:51,171 --> 00:10:52,004
probably see how relatively speaking 
they are easy for English speakers to 

211
00:10:55,131 --> 00:10:55,964
learn.
They are all category one languages 

212
00:10:57,651 --> 00:11:00,140
according to the American Foreign 
Service Institute,

213
00:11:00,141 --> 00:11:02,900
which trains diplomats for their 
overseas assignments.

214
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:06,800
None of the North Germanic languages are
amongst the most widely spoken languages

215
00:11:06,801 --> 00:11:07,634
in the world and people from the Nordic 
countries generally speak excellent 

216
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:11,504
English.
So is it a waste of time to learn a 

217
00:11:12,811 --> 00:11:14,840
north dramatic language?
Of course not.

218
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,930
If you're interested in the cultures and
the history of that region,

219
00:11:17,931 --> 00:11:18,764
then learning one of the languages could
bring you immense joy and because the 

220
00:11:21,561 --> 00:11:24,020
three Scandinavian languages are so 
similar,

221
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,810
learning one of them can unlock the 
doors to the other ones,

222
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:27,644
especially of the written languages,
and if you're an avid traveler or you 

223
00:11:30,441 --> 00:11:31,274
want to go backpacking around the world,
then you will probably meet in a 

224
00:11:33,411 --> 00:11:34,244
surprising number of Scandinavians and 
knowing their language or even one of 

225
00:11:37,011 --> 00:11:37,844
the other two languages will help you 
break the ice and get to know some 

226
00:11:40,311 --> 00:11:43,010
wonderful and possibly highly attractive
people.

227
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:45,650
And if you are interested in the old 
Nordic cultures,

228
00:11:45,651 --> 00:11:47,840
then you might benefit from learning.
Icelandic.

229
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:51,260
Since written Icelandic is still very 
similar to old norse,

230
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:54,490
so don't hesitate to start learning of 
the North Germanic languages,

231
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:57,670
which could be your portal into a whole 
new world.

232
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:58,563
So the question of the day,
native speakers of North Germanic 

233
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:01,624
languages,
what is your experience communicating 

234
00:12:02,981 --> 00:12:03,814
with the speakers of other languages?
Which of the other languages do you 

235
00:12:05,921 --> 00:12:09,160
understand the most and how do you 
bridge that communication gap?

236
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,053
We'd like to know,
and everyone else jump in and leave 

237
00:12:12,221 --> 00:12:15,540
whatever comments you want.
Thank you for watching and have a nice.
