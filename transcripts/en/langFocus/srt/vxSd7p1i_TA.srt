00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:08,703
Hello everyone.
Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and 

2
00:00:10,481 --> 00:00:11,314
my name is Paul.
Today I'm going to be talking about a 

3
00:00:13,091 --> 00:00:17,530
language called Hindus stanny or it's 
sometimes called Hindus standing.

4
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:18,890
Okay.

5
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:21,140
There are countries with names like 
Pakistan,

6
00:00:21,141 --> 00:00:22,480
Afghanistan,
Kazic,

7
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:24,980
Stan is there a country called 
Hindustan?

8
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:26,173
Well,
kind of at certain points throughout 

9
00:00:27,651 --> 00:00:28,484
history at the term,
Hindustan has been used to refer to all 

10
00:00:30,801 --> 00:00:31,634
of India,
but more generally it is used to refer 

11
00:00:33,741 --> 00:00:36,440
to the area of the northern Indian sub 
continent.

12
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:39,020
The term Hindustan itself is a Persian 
term,

13
00:00:39,021 --> 00:00:43,010
meaning the land of the Indus River.
Hindustan Steny is a language that arose

14
00:00:43,011 --> 00:00:43,844
in the Hindustan region.
Maybe you've never heard of Hindu 

15
00:00:45,931 --> 00:00:46,764
standing before,
but you've probably heard of Hindi and 

16
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:49,483
Urdu.
Hindi standing is a clery centric 

17
00:00:51,201 --> 00:00:53,420
language,
meaning that it's a single language that

18
00:00:53,421 --> 00:00:55,940
has two different standard varieties.

19
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,080
Okay.

20
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,960
Even though Hindi and Urdu are referred 
to by different names,

21
00:01:00,961 --> 00:01:03,270
the spoken language is essentially the 
same.

22
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:07,590
Aside from some differences and accent 
and maybe local regional vocabulary.

23
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,270
The standard languages,
however,

24
00:01:09,271 --> 00:01:10,104
which are used in writing and in formal 
situations have more significant 

25
00:01:13,261 --> 00:01:17,490
differences that reflect the cultural 
and religious identity of the speakers,

26
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:18,893
but the development of these two 
standard languages is a recent 

27
00:01:21,091 --> 00:01:21,924
phenomenon for most of us history.
Hinder standing was a single language 

28
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,940
that was referred to by various 
different names.

29
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,230
Hindustan he has spoken as a native 
language by lots and lots of people.

30
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,760
It depends on how you count it,
but around 324 million people are native

31
00:01:35,761 --> 00:01:36,594
speakers of either Hindi or Urdu.
There are about 258 million speakers of 

32
00:01:40,711 --> 00:01:45,711
Hindi in India and about 52 million 
speakers of Urdu in India and 14.7

33
00:01:46,141 --> 00:01:46,974
million speakers of through do in 
Pakistan and that's referring to native 

34
00:01:50,011 --> 00:01:50,700
speakers.

35
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,840
They also function as Lingua Franca is 
in very linguistically diverse regions.

36
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,370
There are an additional 214000002nd 
language speakers of Hindu standing.

37
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:00,323
This is perhaps most striking in 
Pakistan were only 8% of the people 

38
00:02:03,511 --> 00:02:07,650
speak Urdu as a native language,
but over 94 million people speak it as a

39
00:02:07,651 --> 00:02:11,460
second language because it is widely 
learned as the language of education.

40
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:15,750
There are also 120000002nd language 
speakers of Hindi in India,

41
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,673
so if we include both native speakers 
and second language speakers of both 

42
00:02:19,531 --> 00:02:20,364
varieties of Hindu standing,
then there are about 538 million 

43
00:02:23,551 --> 00:02:27,240
speakers of the language hinders 
standing as a member of the Indo area in

44
00:02:27,241 --> 00:02:32,140
branch of the Indo European language 
family and it's a descendant of the Sora

45
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:32,973
Seine Prek read language.
The language from which all modern Indo 

46
00:02:34,801 --> 00:02:35,634
area in language is descended from and 
if we go back earlier than the 

47
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:41,190
[inaudible] language,
it is a descendant of Sanskrit,

48
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:45,900
early forms of Hindu standing developed 
between the seventh to 13th century CE,

49
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:46,913
a time of heavy Islamic influence on the
Indian subcontinent due to conquest by 

50
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:52,560
Central Asian Turkic invaders.

51
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:55,540
Then in the 13th century CE,
the Deli sultanate,

52
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,560
it began its rule and expanded this 
Islamic influence.

53
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:01,840
Hindu standing was the language of the 
common people around Delhi.

54
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:02,703
While Persian became the official state 
language and language of the courts and 

55
00:03:05,651 --> 00:03:06,484
the language of the elite.
The Deli sultanate was a Muslim kingdom 

56
00:03:09,131 --> 00:03:12,910
which was ruled by a success of Turkic 
and Afghan dynasties.

57
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:13,923
These dynasties were personalized,
meaning that they looked up to and 

58
00:03:16,451 --> 00:03:19,630
admired the Persian culture,
so they brought the Persian language and

59
00:03:19,631 --> 00:03:23,470
its literary traditions with them to 
understand and they also spoke their own

60
00:03:23,471 --> 00:03:25,930
native languages among them Turkic 
languages.

61
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,003
They were followed by the Mughal empire 
in 1526 they were another person as to 

62
00:03:30,671 --> 00:03:33,640
people of Turkic Mongol descent and like
the Deli salt in it.

63
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:36,520
They introduced Persian as the official 
language of the empire,

64
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:40,720
the Lingua Franca of the elite people 
and the prestigious literary language.

65
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:43,443
At the same time,
Arabic was influential as a language of 

66
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:46,324
religion during this time Hindustan me,
which was known by different names such 

67
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:50,104
as [inaudible] and they lovey spread 
over much of the northern Indian sub 

68
00:03:53,021 --> 00:03:53,854
continent as a Lingua Franca.
Although there were some local 

69
00:03:55,781 --> 00:03:56,614
differences in vocabulary.
The influence of Persian during these 

70
00:03:58,961 --> 00:03:59,794
dynasties as well as the status of 
Arabic as the language of religion had 

71
00:04:03,131 --> 00:04:05,050
an impact on the Hindu standing 
language,

72
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:05,913
but the degree of that impact,
it depended on the local area and the 

73
00:04:08,531 --> 00:04:10,600
culture and the religion of that 
community.

74
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,583
For example,
Muslim communities used more Arabic and 

75
00:04:13,661 --> 00:04:17,770
Persian words and wrote in the pair,
so Arabic script called Nesta leak while

76
00:04:17,771 --> 00:04:21,970
Hindu communities used more sanskrit 
words and wrote in the Devanagari script

77
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:26,110
in the 18th century,
towards the end of the Mughal empire,

78
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,033
a form of Hindu standing based on the 
Kirribilli dialect of Delhi came to 

79
00:04:30,341 --> 00:04:34,930
replace Persian as the language of the 
elite and soon after under British rule,

80
00:04:34,931 --> 00:04:37,570
it became the official language along 
with English.

81
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:41,230
It was a variety of Hindu standing 
containing Persian vocabulary.

82
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:43,750
Another name for that language started 
to be used,

83
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:44,584
which was Urdu.
That name Urdu is a shortened form of 

84
00:04:47,021 --> 00:04:48,890
the Persian phrase is urban,
a Odu,

85
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:49,773
which means language of the camp.
That is because the language was the 

86
00:04:52,331 --> 00:04:53,164
Lingua Franca of the moog out army and 
was used in their army camps until this 

87
00:04:56,711 --> 00:04:57,544
Persian ised variety of Hindu standing 
was made the official language 

88
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,313
Hindustan.
He was considered a single language for 

89
00:05:02,711 --> 00:05:05,260
all communities with mere local 
variations,

90
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:06,183
but when the [inaudible] variety written
and nostalgic script was made an 

91
00:05:08,711 --> 00:05:12,010
official language by the British,
this angered Hindus who thought that the

92
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:14,320
language should be written in the 
Devanagari script,

93
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,333
which is native to the sub continent.
This erupted into a major dispute over 

94
00:05:18,641 --> 00:05:20,500
which script the language should be 
written in.

95
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:21,423
Amid this dispute,
the standard language of Hindu standing 

96
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:23,874
began to diverged into two different 
languages with Hindi drawing on sense 

97
00:05:27,211 --> 00:05:30,940
greed for much of its formal vocabulary 
and purging the language of some of it's

98
00:05:30,941 --> 00:05:32,650
Persian and Arabic vocabulary.

99
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:33,823
Urdu went the other direction,
purging the language of some of its 

100
00:05:35,921 --> 00:05:36,754
sense,
great vocabulary and expanding the 

101
00:05:38,051 --> 00:05:38,884
amount of Persian and Arabic vocabulary.
But this applies mainly to the standard 

102
00:05:42,071 --> 00:05:42,904
written languages with the spoken 
language is remaining almost completely 

103
00:05:45,401 --> 00:05:48,220
intelligible.
When a Hindi speaker and an Urdu speaker

104
00:05:48,221 --> 00:05:49,054
encounter each other,
they have no problem communicating at 

105
00:05:50,921 --> 00:05:53,080
all.
There might be some different vocabulary

106
00:05:53,081 --> 00:05:53,914
that filters down from the literary 
language and there might be some 

107
00:05:55,751 --> 00:05:56,584
different vocabulary coming from local 
dialects and there might be a slightly 

108
00:05:59,301 --> 00:06:00,134
different accent,
but generally they are not very 

109
00:06:01,491 --> 00:06:02,960
different at all.
In fact,

110
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:06,220
bollywood movies are created in a kind 
of neutral Hindustan.

111
00:06:06,221 --> 00:06:08,780
The language that is usually neither 
Hindi nor [inaudible],

112
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,220
it's both.
To do this,

113
00:06:10,221 --> 00:06:11,054
they avoid using literary vocabulary 
that is specific to either language and 

114
00:06:14,151 --> 00:06:17,300
they focus on the common vocabulary of 
the spoken languages.

115
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:22,190
Let's look at a couple of sentences to 
see how similar the two languages are in

116
00:06:22,191 --> 00:06:25,670
casual speech and how they diverged in 
the more formal register.

117
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:30,230
The first sentence means I want to meet 
you first in casual Urdu

118
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:31,283
math.

119
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,960
Now in casual Hindi Ma [inaudible].
So as you can see,

120
00:06:38,391 --> 00:06:43,040
the casual forms are quite similar or 
almost the same now in literary or do

121
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:44,573
map

122
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,500
now in literary Hindi,
[inaudible] Opsm malicky come not hair.

123
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:55,610
In the literary forms.
You can see that the vocabulary is quite

124
00:06:55,611 --> 00:06:57,320
different.
The next sentence,

125
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:00,680
I want to know how you are in casual 
Urdu

126
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,873
map

127
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:08,990
now when casual Hindi,
Matt [inaudible] who in literary or do

128
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:19,830
and now in literary Hindi,
Matt [inaudible].

129
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:21,993
These examples basically showed that 
Hindustan he has a single language but 

130
00:07:24,551 --> 00:07:25,384
that literary Urdu and literary kindie 
have been crafted to reflect the 

131
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:31,690
different religious and literary 
traditions of their speakers.

132
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:32,643
Of course,
it would be a mistake to think that all 

133
00:07:33,701 --> 00:07:34,534
Muslims on the Indian sub continent 
speak Urdu and that all Hindus speak 

134
00:07:37,781 --> 00:07:39,370
Hindi,
but think of it like this.

135
00:07:39,371 --> 00:07:40,204
For people who specifically speak Hindi 
[inaudible] their religion basically 

136
00:07:43,121 --> 00:07:45,760
determines which one they speak Hindi or
Urdu.

137
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,450
It would also be a mistake to think that
Urdu is the Pakistani language.

138
00:07:49,451 --> 00:07:50,284
While Hindi is the Indian language,
Urdu is the official language of 

139
00:07:52,841 --> 00:07:53,674
Pakistan along with English,
but in fact only 8% of the population 

140
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,200
are native speakers of Urdu.
As I said before,

141
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:00,363
numerous other languages are spoken in 
Pakistan and the most widely spoken one 

142
00:08:03,161 --> 00:08:03,994
is actually Punjabi,
but Urdu is the lingua franca and 

143
00:08:06,221 --> 00:08:07,780
virtually everybody learns it.

144
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:08,943
In India,
Hindi and English are the official 

145
00:08:10,631 --> 00:08:14,350
languages at the national level,
but each state is free to choose its own

146
00:08:14,351 --> 00:08:15,184
official languages too.
There are a total of 20 recognized 

147
00:08:17,591 --> 00:08:20,530
official languages at the state level 
and that includes Urdu.

148
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:22,870
Urdu is not just the language of 
Pakistan,

149
00:08:22,871 --> 00:08:25,660
it's also an official language in eight 
states in India,

150
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:29,710
including the Deli Capitol region.
It is spoken by 51.5

151
00:08:29,711 --> 00:08:32,650
million native speakers in India and 
that's 3.5

152
00:08:32,651 --> 00:08:35,830
times greater than the number of Urdu 
native speakers in Pakistan.

153
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:39,430
So how hard is it to learn,
hinder standing either Hindi or Urdu?

154
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,593
Well,
if you're a speaker of an Indo European 

155
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:42,754
language than you already speak a 
language that's related to hinder 

156
00:08:44,921 --> 00:08:47,440
standing.
So most of the grammatical concepts will

157
00:08:47,441 --> 00:08:48,274
be familiar to you,
but there will also be some challenging 

158
00:08:50,501 --> 00:08:51,334
differences as well.
If we look back at our sentence from 

159
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:57,330
before in English,
it translates something like I you meet,

160
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:00,420
want English is an Svo language.

161
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,570
While Hindu standing is generally Sov,
that means subject,

162
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:06,330
object,
verb and the verb goes at the end of the

163
00:09:06,331 --> 00:09:07,164
clause.
You will also notice that meat comes 

164
00:09:09,151 --> 00:09:09,984
before once sold.
The auxiliary verb or the helping verb 

165
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:13,463
comes after the main verb.
At the very end of the clause or 

166
00:09:15,601 --> 00:09:16,860
sentence.
In Hindi,

167
00:09:16,861 --> 00:09:21,120
there are also feminine and masculine 
nouns as well as three noun cases,

168
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,133
but these three known cases seems 
significantly simpler than some other 

169
00:09:24,691 --> 00:09:28,020
languages that you may have encountered.
Hungarian.

170
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:31,410
One of the hardest things about learning
Hindi or Urdu just might be that so many

171
00:09:31,411 --> 00:09:34,140
people on the Indian subcontinent are 
fluent in English,

172
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:34,974
so it might be hard to get them to speak
any other language than English with 

173
00:09:37,351 --> 00:09:39,390
you,
especially highly educated people,

174
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:42,660
but if you spend time with the common 
people that you meet every day,

175
00:09:42,661 --> 00:09:44,970
then you'll have plenty of chances to 
practice.

176
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,833
Speaking about Hindi and Urdu can be 
confusing because they used to be 

177
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:52,290
considered one language and now in terms
of spoken communication,

178
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,124
they are still essentially one language.
Whether someone speaks Hindi or whether 

179
00:09:56,131 --> 00:09:56,964
they speak Urdu,
depends more on their cultural and 

180
00:09:59,041 --> 00:09:59,874
religious identity or do speakers 
identify with Islamic and Persian 

181
00:10:03,031 --> 00:10:07,260
heritage and its literary tradition.
While Hindi speakers identify with sense

182
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:10,260
greet and the Hindu religion and its 
literary tradition,

183
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:13,530
they speak the same language but on top 
of that spoken language.

184
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,393
Each group has adopted a formal literary
tradition that emphasizes its preferred 

185
00:10:18,241 --> 00:10:21,840
cultural and religious identity as a 
learner of the language.

186
00:10:21,841 --> 00:10:24,420
Assuming that you want to converse and 
communicate with people.

187
00:10:24,421 --> 00:10:25,254
Then learning either variety,
we'll give you access to the other one 

188
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:28,883
and that's a total number of 538 million
people and with a diaspora all over the 

189
00:10:33,601 --> 00:10:35,610
world,
even outside of the sub continent,

190
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:36,623
you will have countless opportunities to
practice and make new connections using 

191
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,400
the [inaudible] language.

192
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,440
And that brings us to the end of this 
video.

193
00:10:43,441 --> 00:10:44,274
Speakers of Hindi or Urdu,
we'd like to hear your comments down 

194
00:10:46,561 --> 00:10:47,394
below.
Tell us your experience with 

195
00:10:48,391 --> 00:10:51,960
communicating with people who speak the 
other variety of Hindu standing.

196
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,720
Is it the same language to you?
How much difference is there?

197
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:57,600
How much similarity is there?
Let us know in the comments.

198
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,440
I would also like to thank everyone who 
made new patriot and contributions since

199
00:11:01,441 --> 00:11:02,274
the last video I made and also to people
who gave one time donations through the 

200
00:11:05,341 --> 00:11:09,150
blue support button on the channel page.
And also I'd like to say thanks to those

201
00:11:09,151 --> 00:11:09,984
people who have offered to help out with
some of the videos on the Geo focus 

202
00:11:12,871 --> 00:11:13,704
channel and today is somebody also 
offered to help out by submitting some 

203
00:11:16,621 --> 00:11:19,350
subtitles or captions in their native 
language.

204
00:11:19,351 --> 00:11:21,840
For some of my videos,
that would be a great thing.

205
00:11:21,841 --> 00:11:22,674
If you'd like to do that too,
then that's very welcome and I would be 

206
00:11:25,081 --> 00:11:25,914
very thankful.
Any help like that that you can do to 

207
00:11:27,571 --> 00:11:30,930
support the channel is fine by me.
Thank you for watching.

208
00:11:30,931 --> 00:11:31,900
Have a nice day.
