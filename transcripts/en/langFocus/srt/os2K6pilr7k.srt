00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,850
Hello everyone and welcome to the lange 
focus channel.

2
00:00:02,851 --> 00:00:03,684
Today I'm going to talk about a question
that I've been getting quite a lot 

3
00:00:06,301 --> 00:00:11,010
recently and that is what kind of job 
can I do with my foreign language skills

4
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:14,910
or what kind of job should I do if I'm 
interested in foreign languages?

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:16,043
Now this is a question that I respect 
because I've witnessed a lot of people 

6
00:00:18,841 --> 00:00:19,674
investing years of their life into 
studying a language kind of with the 

7
00:00:22,201 --> 00:00:23,034
assumption that it would naturally 
improve their career or give them new 

8
00:00:25,801 --> 00:00:26,634
opportunities,
but without having a plan for how they 

9
00:00:28,651 --> 00:00:29,484
would use that language,
they didn't really benefit from it and 

10
00:00:31,471 --> 00:00:32,304
ended up being quite frustrated.
So young people who are asking this 

11
00:00:34,651 --> 00:00:35,484
question early on,
I think you are thinking about things 

12
00:00:37,411 --> 00:00:38,244
the right way,
but the answer to this question depends 

13
00:00:39,931 --> 00:00:43,890
on just how you imagine your life in the
future and how far you really want to go

14
00:00:43,891 --> 00:00:45,180
with your language study.

15
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,253
Now,
some jobs are specifically language 

16
00:00:47,461 --> 00:00:50,460
related.
Other jobs are not specifically language

17
00:00:50,461 --> 00:00:52,980
related,
but a foreign language could be an asset

18
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,470
and for other jobs it's not really 
necessary at all,

19
00:00:55,471 --> 00:00:58,150
but it might be useful for your overall 
lifestyle.

20
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,810
I'm going to talk about those three 
types of situations.

21
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,990
So first up are jobs that are 
specifically language related.

22
00:01:03,991 --> 00:01:04,824
For these jobs,
you need to have some expertise in the 

23
00:01:06,271 --> 00:01:08,640
language.
You need to have a deep understanding of

24
00:01:08,641 --> 00:01:09,474
the language.
So the first kind of job is to teach a 

25
00:01:11,311 --> 00:01:12,450
language.
Here in Japan,

26
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,520
I know a lot of people who teach 
English.

27
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,210
I also know people who teach other 
languages like French or Spanish.

28
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:19,223
Now,
even if you don't have a lot of 

29
00:01:20,011 --> 00:01:20,844
qualifications,
there are some opportunities to teach 

30
00:01:22,771 --> 00:01:23,604
your language,
especially if it's a major global 

31
00:01:25,201 --> 00:01:26,034
language and especially if it's English,
but the more qualifications that you 

32
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:29,454
have,
then of course the better opportunities 

33
00:01:30,811 --> 00:01:34,200
you get and the higher pay you can get,
the better positions you can find.

34
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,980
Now if you want to study a foreign 
language that's not your native language

35
00:01:37,981 --> 00:01:41,250
and then teach that language,
then you're looking at a situation where

36
00:01:41,251 --> 00:01:45,000
you really need to get some expertise.
You really need to get qualifications.

37
00:01:45,001 --> 00:01:45,834
You should get like a masters degree or 
maybe a phd or qualifications that show 

38
00:01:49,531 --> 00:01:52,680
that you know that language very well at
an academic level,

39
00:01:52,681 --> 00:01:55,110
at a deep level of not just a 
conversational level.

40
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:55,973
That's if you're going to teach a 
language that's not your native 

41
00:01:57,961 --> 00:02:00,480
language.
Now another type of job that is language

42
00:02:00,481 --> 00:02:03,480
specific is becoming a translator or an 
interpreter.

43
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,230
Now the difference between those,
just to clarify a translator is somebody

44
00:02:07,231 --> 00:02:08,064
who translates texts.
They translate written materials from 

45
00:02:10,441 --> 00:02:11,274
one language to another,
but an interpreter as somebody who 

46
00:02:13,141 --> 00:02:13,974
translates speech that translate the 
things people are saying live in real 

47
00:02:17,161 --> 00:02:18,420
time as they are speaking.

48
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:19,523
Now,
being a translator or an interpreter 

49
00:02:20,821 --> 00:02:21,654
requires you to have a very deep 
understanding of that language because 

50
00:02:24,391 --> 00:02:27,420
there's really no room for error or 
misunderstanding.

51
00:02:27,421 --> 00:02:31,080
You have to translate sometimes very 
important information and mistakes could

52
00:02:31,081 --> 00:02:31,914
be a big problem.
So you need to have very good almost 

53
00:02:34,351 --> 00:02:37,290
native level skills,
especially for if you're interpreting in

54
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:39,990
real time.
But also you need to learn the skills of

55
00:02:39,991 --> 00:02:40,824
translation or interpreting.
Those are separate skills that you need 

56
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:44,124
to learn on top of knowing the language.
So for these jobs that are specifically 

57
00:02:47,071 --> 00:02:47,904
language related,
there's really no room for language 

58
00:02:49,771 --> 00:02:50,604
dabblers.
You really need to have a comprehensive 

59
00:02:52,141 --> 00:02:55,680
understanding of that language and you 
have to be able to show that you can use

60
00:02:55,681 --> 00:02:56,514
that language at almost a native level.
Next up are jobs that are not 

61
00:02:59,651 --> 00:03:00,484
specifically language related.
They are basically focused on another 

62
00:03:03,071 --> 00:03:04,180
skill that you need.

63
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,193
But the language is an additional asset.
The first kind of job is one that 

64
00:03:08,141 --> 00:03:12,010
requires some technical expertise,
but having a language on top of that,

65
00:03:12,011 --> 00:03:16,180
we'll give you some extra opportunities.
So an example that I've heard is from an

66
00:03:16,181 --> 00:03:17,014
engineer.
His company sells some sort of machines 

67
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:23,320
to companies around the world and they 
send this engineer to those companies so

68
00:03:23,321 --> 00:03:24,154
he can teach people how to use those 
machines in their factory so he learns 

69
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,920
foreign languages so that he can do 
that.

70
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,310
I believe this guy in particular was 
working in Indonesia,

71
00:03:33,311 --> 00:03:34,144
so he learned Indonesian to be able to 
teach those people in their native 

72
00:03:36,701 --> 00:03:38,230
language.
Another example,

73
00:03:38,231 --> 00:03:40,750
career,
his business with a regional focus.

74
00:03:40,751 --> 00:03:41,584
For example,
maybe you get a commerce degree or you 

75
00:03:43,751 --> 00:03:45,940
get a master's of business 
administration,

76
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:46,803
an Mba,
but also you have some language skills 

77
00:03:49,001 --> 00:03:49,834
and maybe you work for a company that 
does business in that region or does 

78
00:03:52,361 --> 00:03:54,430
business with companies in that region.

79
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:56,860
Another example career is the foreign 
service.

80
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:57,723
Being a diplomat,
being someone who works at your 

81
00:03:59,201 --> 00:04:02,320
country's embassies abroad.
When you work in the foreign service,

82
00:04:02,321 --> 00:04:03,154
I think that often involves some kind of
language training before you are sent 

83
00:04:05,861 --> 00:04:06,694
abroad,
but knowing some languages in advanced 

84
00:04:08,441 --> 00:04:10,990
before you apply is probably a big 
asset.

85
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:14,230
Another example is being a tour guide.
Now a tour guides.

86
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,093
Main focus is not the language,
it's the history and it's the 

87
00:04:17,321 --> 00:04:19,570
anthropology and all of those sorts of 
things,

88
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:20,523
but having a language that they can 
explain things in that will help them 

89
00:04:23,441 --> 00:04:24,274
have other opportunities.
So maybe you might specialize in 

90
00:04:26,471 --> 00:04:28,600
tourists from Japan,
you learn Japanese,

91
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:32,620
you can be a tour guide for Japanese 
tourists depending on where you live.

92
00:04:32,621 --> 00:04:33,454
Another option might be to do some other
job in the tourism industry or open a 

93
00:04:36,851 --> 00:04:38,530
business in the tourism industry.

94
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:41,020
If you live on Bailey island in 
Indonesia,

95
00:04:41,021 --> 00:04:41,854
then you would be crazy not to learn 
English and Japanese and maybe some 

96
00:04:44,501 --> 00:04:46,900
other languages that are common amongst 
tourists.

97
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,030
Another career as being a cabin 
attended.

98
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:49,923
Now their main focus is on safety 
training on a emergency response and 

99
00:04:53,021 --> 00:04:53,854
that kind of thing.
But knowing a language that's an 

100
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:56,194
additional asset,
probably they need to know English in 

101
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,373
most cases,
but they also need to know the language 

102
00:05:01,031 --> 00:05:05,020
of the country they're working in or of 
the destination that they often fly too.

103
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,790
Maybe they don't need to know it 
fluently,

104
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:07,624
but knowing some of that language will 
help them deal with the passengers on 

105
00:05:10,151 --> 00:05:10,984
the plan.
So if you live in Los Angeles and you 

106
00:05:12,341 --> 00:05:13,174
often fly to Asia than knowing Japanese 
or Korean or mandarin or another 

107
00:05:16,781 --> 00:05:19,210
language like that would probably be a 
big asset.

108
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,310
Now all of these jobs I just talked 
about,

109
00:05:21,311 --> 00:05:23,760
they're focused on another important 
skill,

110
00:05:23,761 --> 00:05:25,390
so they're not focused on language.

111
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:28,810
So you don't need a specific language 
qualification in most cases,

112
00:05:28,811 --> 00:05:29,644
but you need to be able to demonstrate 
that you can use that language on the 

113
00:05:32,411 --> 00:05:33,910
job.
That's the most important thing.

114
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:34,953
The third type of job I want to mention 
is one that doesn't really have any 

115
00:05:37,301 --> 00:05:38,134
language requirement,
but learning that language would be 

116
00:05:40,031 --> 00:05:43,180
useful for your off time and for your 
overall lifestyle.

117
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,103
So let's say that you live in Singapore 
and your company does business in 

118
00:05:46,691 --> 00:05:47,524
English,
then you don't have to learn any other 

119
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:51,040
language.
People in Singapore speak English,

120
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:55,420
but nearby as Malaysia and Indonesia.
So let's say you want to travel there on

121
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:56,254
your off time.
Learning molay or learning Indonesian 

122
00:05:58,011 --> 00:05:58,844
would be very useful in that situation.
So think about the kind of lifestyle 

123
00:06:02,001 --> 00:06:04,940
that you want to have and think about 
how language is fit in with that.

124
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,570
Let's say that you want to live the 
corporate expat lifestyle and some place

125
00:06:08,571 --> 00:06:09,404
like Hong Kong.

126
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,333
Then you can study Cantonese while you 
get your finance degree or you get your 

127
00:06:13,371 --> 00:06:14,204
mba or whatever.
If you want to be a programmer and you 

128
00:06:16,371 --> 00:06:18,680
can program from your laptop anywhere in
the world,

129
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:19,543
then think about what country you would 
like to live in and learn the language 

130
00:06:21,831 --> 00:06:22,664
of that country.
If you're an avid traveler and you love 

131
00:06:24,561 --> 00:06:27,110
the idea of living in different 
countries all the time,

132
00:06:27,111 --> 00:06:27,944
then you can learn how to do businesses 
on the Internet and you can learn the 

133
00:06:31,011 --> 00:06:34,720
language of whatever countries that you 
want to spend an extended period of time

134
00:06:34,721 --> 00:06:35,554
then or if you want to learn a foreign 
language and you want to someday reach 

135
00:06:38,151 --> 00:06:40,610
to an expert level and be able to teach 
that language,

136
00:06:40,611 --> 00:06:43,410
then plan ahead for that.
Maybe go for your master's degree,

137
00:06:43,411 --> 00:06:44,244
your phd tried to really get a deep 
understanding and overall knowledge of 

138
00:06:47,751 --> 00:06:48,584
that language.
So these are just my thoughts on that 

139
00:06:50,241 --> 00:06:52,400
based on things that I know and things 
that I've heard.

140
00:06:52,401 --> 00:06:55,020
But a lot of the viewers have different 
perspectives.

141
00:06:55,021 --> 00:06:57,920
Some of you probably have jobs that 
involve foreign languages,

142
00:06:57,921 --> 00:06:58,754
so we want to know what you think.
If you have any other ideas or any 

143
00:07:01,131 --> 00:07:03,650
questions about this topic,
leave them down below.

144
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,750
Thank you for watching and have a nice.
