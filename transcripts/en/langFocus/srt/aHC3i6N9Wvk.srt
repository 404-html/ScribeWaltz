1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,540
Quiz time or the following words?
Chinese or Japanese first?

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:07,020
Yes,
it's Japanese next.

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,200
It's Chinese.
Next.

4
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:14,430
Actually this is both Chinese and 
Japanese and finally,

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,580
actually this is neither.
This is ty.

6
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,370
What you thought.
All Asian languages are the same.

7
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,473
Hello everyone.
Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and 

8
00:00:27,981 --> 00:00:28,814
my name is Paul.
Today's topic is the question how 

9
00:00:30,951 --> 00:00:31,784
similar our Chinese and Japanese,
a lot of people look at a map of Asia 

10
00:00:35,331 --> 00:00:36,164
and see how close to Japan and China are
or they might look at a sample of 

11
00:00:38,961 --> 00:00:39,794
Chinese and Japanese writing and think 
that something looks similar and they 

12
00:00:42,051 --> 00:00:44,570
might conclude that the two languages 
are similar,

13
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,550
but are they really similar?
Well,

14
00:00:46,551 --> 00:00:49,520
the short answer is no.
They are completely different languages,

15
00:00:49,521 --> 00:00:50,354
but Japanese has been highly influenced 
by Chinese and it's vocabulary and then 

16
00:00:53,661 --> 00:00:54,494
it's writing systems.
Chinese and Japanese do not share any 

17
00:00:56,631 --> 00:00:59,150
common origin and they don't belong to 
the same language.

18
00:00:59,151 --> 00:00:59,984
Family,
the Chinese languages belonged to the 

19
00:01:01,341 --> 00:01:02,630
CNO,
to Betson language.

20
00:01:02,631 --> 00:01:06,440
Family in Japanese as far as we know 
belongs to the Japonica language.

21
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:08,360
Family phonology.
First off,

22
00:01:08,361 --> 00:01:09,194
the phonology of the language is,
is very different with the most basic 

23
00:01:11,361 --> 00:01:13,640
difference being that Chinese is a tonal
language.

24
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,473
While Japanese is not a tonal language 
is one in which there are tones or 

25
00:01:17,391 --> 00:01:18,224
pitches that helped determine the 
meaning of the words you use if you use 

26
00:01:20,871 --> 00:01:23,360
the wrong tone than the meaning of the 
word changes.

27
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:26,740
Here's an example,
the word for teacher sure.

28
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:30,170
And the word for naive slow.
Sure.

29
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,423
And the word for old fashion.
So I'm sure that Chinese teachers get 

30
00:01:35,271 --> 00:01:39,680
called naive and old fashion all the 
time by mistake or maybe not by mistake.

31
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,753
In Japanese,
there are basically no tones like this 

32
00:01:42,171 --> 00:01:44,660
that determine the meaning of words.
In Japanese,

33
00:01:44,661 --> 00:01:47,960
there is something called pitch accent,
which means that the syllables of a word

34
00:01:47,961 --> 00:01:50,120
have either a higher pitch or a lower 
pitch,

35
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:51,163
but they're not like the tones and 
Chinese because they typically don't 

36
00:01:53,091 --> 00:01:55,820
determine the meaning of the word.
They're more like stress.

37
00:01:55,821 --> 00:01:56,654
In English structure,
the structure and grammar of the two 

38
00:01:59,691 --> 00:02:01,160
languages is completely different.

39
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,520
At the most basic level,
Chinese is an Svo language,

40
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:08,660
while Japanese is an Sov language.
Here's an example in Chinese.

41
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:12,830
Sure.
This means he speaks Chinese and you can

42
00:02:12,831 --> 00:02:13,664
see s the o subject verb object and 
here's that sentence translated into 

43
00:02:18,681 --> 00:02:19,514
Japanese,
how they walk to go google on Nasim us 

44
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:24,500
here we can see s o v subject,
object,

45
00:02:24,501 --> 00:02:25,334
verb and you can see there are some 
extra little words in Japanese that 

46
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:29,960
don't exist in the Chinese sentence.
For example,

47
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:30,823
Japanese has the topic marker Wa which 
doesn't exist in Chinese and Japanese 

48
00:02:34,161 --> 00:02:37,670
also has the object marker all which 
doesn't exist in Chinese.

49
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:39,733
Chinese is an analytic language,
which basically means that you create a 

50
00:02:42,261 --> 00:02:45,770
sentence by a placing independent 
elements side by side.

51
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:48,830
Analytic languages like Chinese do not 
use inflection.

52
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:49,723
Inflection means modifying words to 
indicate some kind of grammatical 

53
00:02:52,281 --> 00:02:53,900
meaning like plural,
gender,

54
00:02:53,901 --> 00:02:55,040
tenths or case.

55
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,460
You don't change any part of a word in 
order to change its meaning.

56
00:02:58,461 --> 00:02:59,294
Instead,
you can add to the meaning of that word 

57
00:03:00,341 --> 00:03:03,160
by adding an extra word next to it.
Japanese,

58
00:03:03,161 --> 00:03:03,994
on the other hand,
it's an a glutinous of language that 

59
00:03:05,171 --> 00:03:06,004
uses inflection.
A gluten native language is used a lot 

60
00:03:07,841 --> 00:03:08,674
of affixes.
Rather than just placing independent 

61
00:03:10,331 --> 00:03:13,510
worlds side by side,
you attach additional pieces to words to

62
00:03:13,511 --> 00:03:14,344
add or modify.
Meaning this kind of inflection in 

63
00:03:16,361 --> 00:03:20,260
Japanese means that Japanese words are 
often longer than Chinese words and that

64
00:03:20,261 --> 00:03:23,620
it may take a few words in Chinese to 
translate one Japanese word.

65
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:27,640
In these Chinese sentences,
we can see that there's no inflection or

66
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:30,573
this sentence means I go to school or 
choose this sentence means I went to 

67
00:03:35,831 --> 00:03:36,664
school,
so no part of the verb is changed to 

68
00:03:38,141 --> 00:03:38,974
indicate the past tense.
We can show the past tense by just 

69
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:42,040
adding a time expression.

70
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:44,800
Now these similar sentences in Japanese 
show inflection.

71
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:49,300
The sentence means I go to school 
[inaudible] I went to school.

72
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,263
Once I see what [inaudible] does and the
polite form of I go to school 

73
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,310
[inaudible] I want to go to school.
What does she wear?

74
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,570
De Gaulle,
achy tie.

75
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:00,910
In this Japanese example,
we use inflection,

76
00:04:00,911 --> 00:04:01,744
changing the word to the Eqi form,
and then we use a gluten nation to 

77
00:04:04,871 --> 00:04:05,704
attach a form that shows intention tied 
in Chinese though there's no inflection 

78
00:04:09,701 --> 00:04:12,310
or agglutination,
you just add an extra word like this.

79
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:16,690
That's just a brief sample of how 
different the grammar is in Japanese and

80
00:04:16,691 --> 00:04:17,524
Chinese.
Basically they're completely different 

81
00:04:18,521 --> 00:04:20,770
languages when it comes to their 
grammatical structure,

82
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:21,723
vocabulary and Chinese characters.
The one area in which there is some 

83
00:04:24,251 --> 00:04:25,084
similarity between Chinese and Japanese 
is in vocabulary and in the use of 

84
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:28,864
Chinese characters.
During a period of great Chinese 

85
00:04:30,551 --> 00:04:33,160
influence between the fifth and ninth 
century Ce,

86
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:36,970
there was a huge amount of borrowing 
from early middle Chinese into Japanese.

87
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,833
Japanese originally had no written form,
so Chinese began to be used as the 

88
00:04:40,661 --> 00:04:43,810
literary language and as the language of
science and religion,

89
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:44,763
Chinese vocabulary began to be borrowed 
into Japanese and the Chinese writing 

90
00:04:47,771 --> 00:04:50,830
system was gradually adapted to fit the 
Japanese language.

91
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:51,783
So not only were at vocabulary board,
but the Chinese characters that 

92
00:04:54,131 --> 00:04:54,964
represent them were also adopted.
60% of the vocabulary words used in 

93
00:04:58,301 --> 00:04:59,134
Japanese are of Chinese origin.
But that includes all of the words in 

94
00:05:01,811 --> 00:05:02,644
the dictionary.
And that includes a lot of very 

95
00:05:03,551 --> 00:05:07,420
specialized academic and formal 
vocabulary that's mainly used in writing

96
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:10,330
and spoken Japanese.
The number of Chinese loan words used as

97
00:05:10,331 --> 00:05:14,740
much lower at about 18% the borrowed 
words were almost all Chinese nouns,

98
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,980
even though in Japanese they might be 
used as verbs or as adjectives.

99
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:20,980
That's just one way in which the 
vocabulary is used differently.

100
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:21,933
But also with the pronunciation of those
Chinese words that were borrowed into 

101
00:05:24,341 --> 00:05:27,430
Japanese changed to match the Japanese 
phonological system.

102
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,010
And that included the loss of the tones 
of those words.

103
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,530
And also these words were borrowed a 
long time ago,

104
00:05:32,531 --> 00:05:35,830
which means that the words have also 
changed in pronunciation in Chinese.

105
00:05:35,831 --> 00:05:38,200
So the pronunciation has diverged quite 
a bit,

106
00:05:38,201 --> 00:05:39,034
meaning that modern Japanese 
pronunciation and modern Chinese 

107
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:44,590
pronunciation of similar characters or 
words is quite different.

108
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,633
And it's also important to point out 
that mandarin was not the standard form 

109
00:05:48,101 --> 00:05:48,934
of Chinese back in those days when those
vocabulary words were borrowed into 

110
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:54,070
Japanese.
So even at the time they were borrowed,

111
00:05:54,071 --> 00:05:56,800
the pronunciation was different from 
standard Chinese today.

112
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:57,663
And what I understand,
the modern Japanese pronunciation of 

113
00:05:59,451 --> 00:06:00,284
those lone words is often more similar 
to modern cantonese than it is to 

114
00:06:02,901 --> 00:06:03,734
Mandarin.
These examples show how the same words 

115
00:06:05,721 --> 00:06:08,510
are pronounced very differently.
In Japanese ended Mandarin,

116
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:09,643
the word for family in Japanese,
it's cut date and actually in Japanese 

117
00:06:12,681 --> 00:06:16,880
the meaning is more like household or 
home and in Mandarin Jab him.

118
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,520
Next,
the word for death in Japanese,

119
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:20,383
she bolt and amendment to the wall next 
to word four season in Japanese key set 

120
00:06:25,191 --> 00:06:30,191
to and in Mandarin Gpa and the word for 
home country in Japanese vocal group and

121
00:06:31,251 --> 00:06:32,084
in Mandarin or so you can see that these
words look the same and they have 

122
00:06:35,811 --> 00:06:38,210
basically the same meaning,
but they sound very different.

123
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,193
So Chinese vocabulary represented by 
Chinese characters were borrowed into 

124
00:06:42,411 --> 00:06:43,244
Japanese,
but those Chinese characters were also 

125
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,824
them applied to native Japanese 
vocabulary that had a related meaning 

126
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:49,463
for those Chinese loan words.
That means that a Chinese speaker can 

127
00:06:51,471 --> 00:06:52,304
often look at a native Japanese word and
understand its core meaning without 

128
00:06:55,101 --> 00:06:58,100
knowing that Japanese words,
because the Chinese character is used to

129
00:06:58,101 --> 00:06:58,934
represent it.
So Chinese people can often read a text 

130
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:01,754
in Japanese and they can make sense of 
the basic meaning of it based on the 

131
00:07:04,281 --> 00:07:05,114
Chinese characters,
but they won't understand all the 

132
00:07:06,711 --> 00:07:07,400
details.

133
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,233
And the same is true in reverse.
Japanese people can look at a Chinese 

134
00:07:10,311 --> 00:07:11,144
texts and kind of make sense of the 
meaning of it based on the Chinese 

135
00:07:13,461 --> 00:07:14,294
characters that they know.
But it is easy to misunderstand the 

136
00:07:16,341 --> 00:07:17,174
details of what's written,
especially if they have zero knowledge 

137
00:07:19,101 --> 00:07:22,340
of the other language.
Here are some Japanese example sentences

138
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:23,174
that have the same Chinese characters,
but the meaning is very different 

139
00:07:25,221 --> 00:07:28,260
because of the inflection that's used.
Nicole [inaudible],

140
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,760
that means the cat eats fish,
Nicola suck and [inaudible].

141
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:35,030
That means the cat doesn't eat fish.
Nicola suck.

142
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:35,883
Another topic.
That means the cat ate fish in the past 

143
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,550
tense.
Nicola [inaudible] Samadhi,

144
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:44,270
the cap plans to eat fish.
Nicola [inaudible] data.

145
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,313
That means the cat was eaten by a fish.
So a Chinese speaker of reading these 

146
00:07:48,071 --> 00:07:51,230
sentences would get the core meaning of 
the Chinese characters,

147
00:07:51,231 --> 00:07:53,480
but they would miss some meaning in the 
inflection.

148
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,313
For example,
the negative or the past tense or 

149
00:07:55,821 --> 00:07:58,220
intention or the passive form.
Especially.

150
00:07:58,221 --> 00:08:00,590
The last example could be highly 
misunderstood,

151
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:01,543
so imagine you're an English speaker 
reading something with English long 

152
00:08:03,531 --> 00:08:05,030
words.
It might look something like this,

153
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,320
Catholic glofish,
blah,

154
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,250
blah,
blah.

155
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,260
Of course,
even after just a little bit of study in

156
00:08:09,261 --> 00:08:10,094
Japanese or Chinese speaker could 
probably learn enough to understand 

157
00:08:12,591 --> 00:08:14,780
basic Japanese sentences like that.
For me,

158
00:08:14,781 --> 00:08:17,600
as someone who's studied Japanese two,
a relatively advanced level,

159
00:08:17,601 --> 00:08:18,434
the same as true in reverse.
When I was in Taiwan last year on the 

160
00:08:21,021 --> 00:08:23,930
subway for example,
I could read a lot of the advertisements

161
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:27,710
and I would get most of the meaning.
I wouldn't understand all of the Chinese

162
00:08:27,711 --> 00:08:28,544
characters,
but I would get usually three out of 

163
00:08:29,871 --> 00:08:33,740
four of them and the fourth one would be
new to me because in Chinese there are a

164
00:08:33,741 --> 00:08:36,710
lot of characters that actually aren't 
used in Japanese at all,

165
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,633
but just getting three out of four of 
them was often enough to understand the 

166
00:08:39,741 --> 00:08:41,270
basic meaning of that advertisement.

167
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:42,163
But of course I had no idea how to 
pronounce those Chinese characters and 

168
00:08:44,451 --> 00:08:46,730
if I tried to read them out loud like 
the Japanese,

169
00:08:46,731 --> 00:08:50,570
I would hear laughter from both my 
girlfriend and from local bystanders.

170
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:51,523
It might seem strange that I can look at
a Chinese character in Chinese and 

171
00:08:53,841 --> 00:08:56,190
understand what it means without knowing
how to say it,

172
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,320
but think of it as a symbol,
like a number.

173
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,213
The number seven right here is 
pronounced differently in different 

174
00:09:01,111 --> 00:09:02,520
languages,
but when you see it,

175
00:09:02,521 --> 00:09:04,650
you know what it means,
no matter how you pronounce it.

176
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:05,663
Chinese characters are kind of like that
except that they represent a much wider 

177
00:09:08,551 --> 00:09:09,384
range of meanings.
The Chinese characters used in any 

178
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:11,874
particular sentence can be very 
different from those used in the other 

179
00:09:14,131 --> 00:09:14,964
language for a sentence of similar 
meaning and in Japanese there are a lot 

180
00:09:17,551 --> 00:09:20,340
of compound words that were created from
Chinese characters,

181
00:09:20,341 --> 00:09:23,460
but those compound words don't actually 
exist in Chinese.

182
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:24,323
These are called Wasa Congo,
which means something like Chinese 

183
00:09:26,431 --> 00:09:27,264
vocabulary created in Japan.
Here are some examples of Wasa icon 

184
00:09:30,231 --> 00:09:31,064
will,
some were created to represent things 

185
00:09:32,401 --> 00:09:33,234
unique to Japan,
like Ninja Geisha and others were 

186
00:09:36,211 --> 00:09:37,044
created during the Meiji period to 
represent western concepts like 

187
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,500
democracy,
men shoes.

188
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:43,283
So even though you might recognize a lot
of characters when you look at some 

189
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:46,374
texts in the other language,
they might be used in a very different 

190
00:09:48,241 --> 00:09:49,800
ways.
So the meaning will be unclear.

191
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:50,813
A Chinese speaker might be confused by 
Wasi Kango when they tried to read some 

192
00:09:53,611 --> 00:09:54,444
Japanese and Japanese people might be 
confused when they read Chinese because 

193
00:09:57,631 --> 00:09:58,464
there are a lot of Chinese characters 
that were never boiled into Japanese in 

194
00:10:00,991 --> 00:10:03,660
the first place or they're not used in 
modern Japanese.

195
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:04,643
But in either case,
even basic knowledge of the other 

196
00:10:06,451 --> 00:10:08,910
language would help in reading 
comprehension quite a bit.

197
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:13,320
Japanese returned moen words in Chinese,
so as we've discussed already,

198
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:16,380
lots of Chinese vocabulary was borrowed 
into Japanese,

199
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:19,890
but some Japanese vocabulary has also 
been borrowed into Chinese.

200
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,970
A moment ago I mentioned Wasa Kango,
Japanese vocabulary created from Chinese

201
00:10:23,971 --> 00:10:26,700
roots vocabulary that didn't exist in 
Chinese,

202
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:27,743
but some of those Lasa Kango have 
actually been borrowed from Japanese 

203
00:10:30,451 --> 00:10:31,284
into Chinese.
Some sources say that such vocabulary 

204
00:10:33,661 --> 00:10:36,930
accounts for around 30% of modern 
Chinese vocabulary.

205
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:38,243
Of course,
the way those returned loan words are 

206
00:10:39,511 --> 00:10:40,344
pronounced as based on the modern 
Chinese pronunciation of the Chinese 

207
00:10:42,961 --> 00:10:44,910
characters.
Here are some examples.

208
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,090
The word for history in Japanese that 
Kishi in Mandarin,

209
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,133
the shoe,
the word for industry in Japanese Kogel 

210
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:52,903
in mandarins,
the word for electron or electronic in 

211
00:10:57,001 --> 00:10:57,834
Japanese.
Then cheat in Mandarin and the word for 

212
00:11:01,981 --> 00:11:05,430
injection in Japanese to shop in 
Mandarin jewel.

213
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:08,010
Sure.
The word for philosophy in Japanese.

214
00:11:08,011 --> 00:11:09,780
Tetsu got goats in Mandarin.

215
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:13,200
Yeah,
the workforce system in Japanese,

216
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:16,230
Cato and in Mandarin.
She told him,

217
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:20,190
and most Chinese people these days are 
probably not even aware that those words

218
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:23,490
were borrowed from Japanese.
It's also important to point out that in

219
00:11:23,491 --> 00:11:24,324
mainland China,
simplified Chinese characters are now 

220
00:11:26,281 --> 00:11:27,114
used as opposed to the traditional 
Chinese characters used in Taiwan and 

221
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:30,773
Hong Kong.
That means that someone from mainland 

222
00:11:31,951 --> 00:11:32,784
China may have some more trouble 
recognizing Japanese Kanji than someone 

223
00:11:35,401 --> 00:11:36,750
from Taiwan.
For example,

224
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,673
someone short,
Chinese and Japanese are very different 

225
00:11:39,451 --> 00:11:41,790
languages,
especially the spoken languages.

226
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,653
Even though there was a lot of 
vocabulary borrowed from Chinese in the 

227
00:11:44,881 --> 00:11:47,670
Japanese and the little bit from 
Japanese into Chinese,

228
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:48,803
only in writing are those two languages 
somewhat intelligible because of the 

229
00:11:51,631 --> 00:11:52,464
Chinese characters that are used.
So the question of the day for Japanese 

230
00:11:55,211 --> 00:11:56,044
speakers,
what's your experience when you look at 

231
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,053
Chinese texts,
are you able to understand the basic 

232
00:11:59,861 --> 00:12:03,730
meanings based on the Chinese characters
and similarly for Chinese speakers?

233
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,860
What happens when you look at a Japanese
texts?

234
00:12:05,861 --> 00:12:06,694
Can you understand the basic meaning or 
do you get confused because of the 

235
00:12:09,191 --> 00:12:11,260
different way that the Chinese 
characters are used?

236
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:12,243
Thanks again to all my patrion 
supporters and I want to say thanks to 

237
00:12:14,351 --> 00:12:16,570
all the new subscribers who joined this 
month.

238
00:12:16,571 --> 00:12:19,840
There are a lot of you and you are very 
welcome and very appreciated.

239
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,790
