00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:16,823
Hello everyone.
Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and 

5
00:00:18,481 --> 00:00:19,314
my name is Paul.
Today's topic is how similar our French 

6
00:00:21,991 --> 00:00:24,360
and Italian,
well they're actually very similar.

7
00:00:24,361 --> 00:00:25,194
They share a lot of common vocabulary 
and the grammar is very similar but in 

8
00:00:28,321 --> 00:00:30,420
terms of phonology they are quite 
different.

9
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,960
So in their spoken form they are 
generally not mutually intelligible.

10
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,540
French and Italian are both romance 
languages.

11
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:37,374
They both developed out of the vulgar 
Latin spoken throughout the Roman 

12
00:00:39,871 --> 00:00:40,704
empire,
but French kind of stands out as 

13
00:00:42,121 --> 00:00:42,954
different from other romance languages.
The historical land of goal is located 

14
00:00:46,381 --> 00:00:47,214
inside Modern Day France and one theory 
is that when the Roman empire conquered 

15
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:53,760
Gaul and tried to force the local 
population to speak Latin,

16
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:54,773
they spoke at using golish speech sounds
and that has affected the phonology and 

17
00:00:58,021 --> 00:00:58,854
the pronunciation of French.
Until this day goldfish was a Celtic 

18
00:01:01,351 --> 00:01:02,184
language.
So that means that there is some Celtic 

19
00:01:03,331 --> 00:01:07,200
influence in the French language,
specifically in phonology and any case,

20
00:01:07,201 --> 00:01:09,600
French and Italian are very closely 
related.

21
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,730
Let's have a look at just how close they
are.

22
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:12,863
Vocabulary,
Italian and French are very similar in 

23
00:01:15,031 --> 00:01:15,864
terms of vocabulary.
The lexical similarity of the two 

24
00:01:18,001 --> 00:01:18,834
languages is 89% that means that 89% of 
the words used have equivalents or 

25
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:23,874
cognates in the other language.
That doesn't mean the words are exactly 

26
00:01:26,311 --> 00:01:28,050
the same,
but they are clearly related.

27
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,230
Some obvious examples,
Valenzuela,

28
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,910
bon Jordan'll until the song into the 
Sunday mosaic,

29
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:36,223
monae,
Jada,

30
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:41,660
and there are some less obvious cognates
to or be dull or medallia order Akella,

31
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,400
[inaudible] Yada Shelf Shit.
She had a car.

32
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,253
Then I think the figure of 89% is 
probably true if we include formal 

33
00:01:52,741 --> 00:01:53,574
literary vocabulary,
but in daily conversation that seems to 

34
00:01:55,591 --> 00:01:57,750
be a little lower.
Let's look at these examples.

35
00:01:58,030 --> 00:01:59,750
Maquila to have Aaliyah,
avn,

36
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,440
ecomaine,
Cucina t prep,

37
00:02:01,441 --> 00:02:03,080
our own cafe,
Msi,

38
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,960
Sita Valisa,
viansa vic McDonald cuisine is you're to

39
00:02:05,961 --> 00:02:06,810
play pound coffee.

40
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:07,913
So here you can see that most of the 
words have an equivalent except for the 

41
00:02:10,561 --> 00:02:12,780
words that are in red.
Those ones are different,

42
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:13,883
like the word for here in Italian it's 
queen and in French it's see and that 

43
00:02:17,191 --> 00:02:18,024
were four width.
In Italian it's con and in friendships 

44
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:24,420
Avec the word for Ian in Italian,
it's in and in friendships don't,

45
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,793
aside from those words,
the other words are all basically 

46
00:02:27,451 --> 00:02:28,284
equivalent except for a couple of 
definite articles which are used 

47
00:02:30,631 --> 00:02:33,060
differently.
I recommend that you pause the video now

48
00:02:33,061 --> 00:02:33,894
and look at the two sentences along with
an English breakdown and see what you 

49
00:02:36,751 --> 00:02:37,584
notice about the equivalents.
Here are another couple of examples in 

50
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:46,200
nondomestic rtd and Entrada in an 
[inaudible] in nuclear power,

51
00:02:46,201 --> 00:02:48,140
don't weight loss a magazine,
the ceramic,

52
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,580
so again,
these sentences are quite similar,

53
00:02:50,581 --> 00:02:52,800
but a few of the words are different.
The mentee,

54
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:53,703
Kathy,
that means forget in Italian and who 

55
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:57,150
bleah means,
forget in French.

56
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,133
And again,
we see the different words for in the 

57
00:02:59,501 --> 00:03:01,930
Italian word in and the French word 
don't.

58
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,080
And we see different words for store,
the Italian word,

59
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:07,540
niggled steel and the French word 
magazine.

60
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:10,540
So again,
why don't you pause the video and have a

61
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:13,630
look at the two sentences and see what 
you can learn by comparing them.

62
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,880
So you can see that in a typical 
sentence.

63
00:03:17,881 --> 00:03:18,714
The majority of vocabulary used is 
similar to the vocabulary used in the 

64
00:03:21,631 --> 00:03:23,340
other language,
but not all of it.

65
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:24,653
Grammar in French and Italian,
the word order and the sentence 

66
00:03:26,821 --> 00:03:30,120
structure are generally very similar.
Here's a simple sentence to show.

67
00:03:30,121 --> 00:03:30,954
Similar would order.
This sentence means I have a newspaper 

68
00:03:33,091 --> 00:03:36,830
for the trip.
He Oh and John anally pedal viaggio j on

69
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,260
[inaudible].
And you can see that these sentences are

70
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:41,820
word for word translatable.

71
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:43,773
Hmm.

72
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,310
But there are also some grammatical 
differences too.

73
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,670
In French subject,
pronouns are consistently used,

74
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:50,743
but in Italian subject,
pronouns generally aren't used except 

75
00:03:53,031 --> 00:03:55,550
for emphasis.
So in French you ship out lonely.

76
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,713
In Italian you will following lazy but 
yo is not usually said so which just 

77
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,480
paddling glazer and there's another 
difference in pronouns in French.

78
00:04:05,481 --> 00:04:09,500
The second person,
formal end plural pronoun is in Italian.

79
00:04:09,501 --> 00:04:13,340
The third person Pronoun Lei is used for
the second person formal.

80
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:16,700
So when French we'd have [inaudible] 
toll on tomorrow,

81
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,253
but in Italian [inaudible] so the 
Italian sentence is like she speaks too 

82
00:04:22,941 --> 00:04:23,774
slowly,
but it should be clear from the context 

83
00:04:25,161 --> 00:04:25,994
that you are seeing you and not she 
because you're talking to someone 

84
00:04:28,221 --> 00:04:29,054
directly.
Also in Italian direct object pronouns 

85
00:04:31,851 --> 00:04:34,340
are also normally attached to the end of
a verb.

86
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:38,060
When it's in the infinitive form.
In French we'd have shoveled day,

87
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,463
but in Italian we'd have eal volume.
Rollo negotiation is also a little 

88
00:04:44,511 --> 00:04:45,800
different.
In the two languages.

89
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:47,880
In French we'd say Jeanette backlit 
phone,

90
00:04:47,881 --> 00:04:48,714
glee with no end path to show negation.
But in Italian we'd say eo known 

91
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:53,360
paddling,
Lazy.

92
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,253
So in French we have no and pop,
but in Italian there's no equivalent of 

93
00:04:57,261 --> 00:04:58,094
Po.

94
00:04:58,810 --> 00:04:59,643
Those are some little differences.
But other major things like the verb 

95
00:05:01,811 --> 00:05:04,150
tenses are basically the same.
French and Italian.

96
00:05:04,151 --> 00:05:06,610
Share the same 14 verb tenses.
Of course,

97
00:05:06,611 --> 00:05:07,444
they're not conjugated exactly the same,
but the tense is function in the same 

98
00:05:10,121 --> 00:05:11,080
way.
For example,

99
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:14,720
let's look at how the past tense is 
formed in French to a mosaic.

100
00:05:14,721 --> 00:05:18,130
Elka shows in Italian too.
I'm on Jato quelled Coza.

101
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:21,880
This means you ate something spoken to 
one person informally.

102
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,650
The verb consists of two parts.
First,

103
00:05:23,651 --> 00:05:24,484
the second person,
singular form of the word for have and 

104
00:05:26,621 --> 00:05:30,160
second the past participle.
Obviously the forms are different,

105
00:05:30,161 --> 00:05:33,310
but the way you use them together to 
create the past tense is the sin.

106
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,593
And just as a quick side note,
notice how to say something in the two 

107
00:05:36,671 --> 00:05:39,550
languages.
Kelika shows versus qual.

108
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:40,443
Coza,
French and Italian grammar is very 

109
00:05:41,981 --> 00:05:42,814
similar,
just like the vocabulary is largely 

110
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:45,520
similar pronunciation.

111
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:46,503
The biggest difference between French 
and Italian and the one that prevents 

112
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:51,700
mutual intelligibility the most is 
pronunciation.

113
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:55,210
Italian pronunciation is mostly phonetic
and mirrors the written words.

114
00:05:55,211 --> 00:05:57,890
Exactly.
French words are pronounced from the way

115
00:05:57,891 --> 00:06:00,200
they're written,
and you have to keep some phonetic rules

116
00:06:00,201 --> 00:06:04,040
in mind when pronouncing words.
Most Italian words end in a vowel,

117
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:06,200
which makes it easy to pronounce the end
of the word.

118
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:07,243
In French,
there are many consonants that are 

119
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,820
usually silent at the end of a word.
For example,

120
00:06:10,821 --> 00:06:15,530
this sentence meaning the weather is 
cold in Italian [inaudible] in French in

121
00:06:15,531 --> 00:06:16,364
fifth squat.
Notice that the d sound at the end of 

122
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:19,363
fall is silent.
Another example is the phrase for white 

123
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:22,964
wine in Italian Vino Bianco in French.
Then blown here at the final C is 

124
00:06:27,531 --> 00:06:28,364
silent,
so the last song we hear is the nasal 

125
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:33,410
sound represented by in van also ends in
a nasal sound.

126
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,630
The end is not pronounced as a consonant
here.

127
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,030
Instead that nasal aises the proceeding 
vowel,

128
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,700
so rather than Van Blonde,
it's van blown.

129
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,390
There are also some other sounds that 
are quite different than French.

130
00:06:44,391 --> 00:06:45,620
For example,
the French are,

131
00:06:45,621 --> 00:06:48,560
it's not the same as the rolled or that 
you would find in Italian.

132
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:49,573
In Italian,
you produce the are by flapping the tip 

133
00:06:51,381 --> 00:06:53,300
of your tongue against the roof of your 
mouth,

134
00:06:53,301 --> 00:06:54,134
behind your teeth,
but the French are as a guttural are 

135
00:06:55,881 --> 00:06:57,560
that's produced at the back of your 
mouth.

136
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:01,690
In Italian [inaudible] in French 
bacteria.

137
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:03,643
So those final silent consonants as well
as the nasal sounds of the French are 

138
00:07:06,891 --> 00:07:08,960
south.
Those are some differences with Italian,

139
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:09,794
but there are also some of the things 
that learners find challenging about 

140
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:12,764
French pronunciation.
Let's finish by just breaking down a 

141
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:18,020
couple more sentences and seeing what 
similarities and differences we notice.

142
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:20,720
Here's the sentence,
meaning what are your favorite dishes in

143
00:07:20,721 --> 00:07:22,040
Italian quality?
SONA,

144
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:25,150
we've lost [inaudible]D in French,
Kennison Ville,

145
00:07:25,151 --> 00:07:25,761
Platte,
[inaudible],

146
00:07:25,761 --> 00:07:27,200
la,
so word by word.

147
00:07:27,201 --> 00:07:30,770
The sentence is what are your plural 
dishes?

148
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:31,663
Plural.
Preferred quality and Ken are 

149
00:07:34,011 --> 00:07:34,844
equivalents.
But notice that the plural ending is 

150
00:07:36,351 --> 00:07:37,370
different.
In Italian,

151
00:07:37,371 --> 00:07:38,204
it's often eat or act,
but in French it's a silent s Somol and 

152
00:07:42,141 --> 00:07:42,974
some are equivalents.
But notice that Somo ends in a vowel 

153
00:07:45,471 --> 00:07:50,471
while some ends in a nasal sound and a 
silent t evos three invo are equivalent,

154
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:51,403
but in Italian,
the definite article is normally used 

155
00:07:53,151 --> 00:07:54,950
with a possessive pronoun like votes 
three.

156
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,110
While in French there's no definite 
article,

157
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,093
PRT and Pla or equivalent,
but notice the different plural endings 

158
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:05,180
and notice that words with I and Italian
often have an l in French.

159
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,380
We've seen another example of that,
the uncle in Italian and blog in French,

160
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:13,610
but if fell,
Iti and pressure are obvious equivalents

161
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,220
just with different accent markings and 
a different ending.

162
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,463
Now here's one more pair of sentences,
but this time I want you to have a look 

163
00:08:21,141 --> 00:08:21,974
at them and notice the similarities and 
differences without me breaking it down 

164
00:08:24,531 --> 00:08:28,850
for you.
In Italian he knows three [inaudible] in

165
00:08:28,851 --> 00:08:30,990
French and those,
I mean finish days unit.

166
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:34,003
So I hope this video has made it clear 
just how similar French and Italian 

167
00:08:36,321 --> 00:08:37,154
really are.
The speaker of one of them can probably 

168
00:08:38,571 --> 00:08:39,404
learn the other quite easily and in 
writing the level of mutual 

169
00:08:41,931 --> 00:08:42,764
intelligibility is quite high.
But because the cognate words are all a 

170
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:46,274
little bit different,
and because of the pronunciation of the 

171
00:08:47,841 --> 00:08:48,674
two languages is so different,
the two languages are not mutually 

172
00:08:51,081 --> 00:08:54,230
intelligible in their spoken form.
But as a learner of Italian,

173
00:08:54,231 --> 00:08:55,064
my previous knowledge,
French makes a lot of things in Italian 

174
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:57,893
instantly clear to me.
So the question of the day for speakers 

175
00:09:00,361 --> 00:09:01,194
of French and Italian,
how similar do you consider the two 

176
00:09:03,241 --> 00:09:06,090
languages to be and to learners of 
French and Italian?

177
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,420
Does your knowledge of one of those 
languages help you make any sense of the

178
00:09:09,421 --> 00:09:10,254
other or help you understand the other?
