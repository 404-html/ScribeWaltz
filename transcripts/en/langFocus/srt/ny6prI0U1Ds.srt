1
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:07,213
Nope.

2
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:17,000
Hello everyone.
Welcome to the Lange focus channel.

3
00:00:17,001 --> 00:00:18,710
My name is Paul.
Thank you for tuning in.

4
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:19,843
Today we're going to talk about some 
famous people who can't speak a foreign 

5
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:23,863
language.
When we think of famous people are 

6
00:00:25,521 --> 00:00:28,340
iconic people,
the image in mind that we have of them,

7
00:00:28,341 --> 00:00:30,950
it's usually just a very thin slice of 
who they are.

8
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:34,400
We know the skills and the talents that 
they choose to share with the public,

9
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,640
but there are always other things about 
them that we don't know and that most of

10
00:00:37,641 --> 00:00:38,474
us would find surprising.
A lot of us would be surprised to know 

11
00:00:41,091 --> 00:00:41,924
that one of the famous celebrities that 
we look up to can speak a foreign 

12
00:00:45,081 --> 00:00:48,530
language.
Now,

13
00:00:48,531 --> 00:00:51,650
there are some famous celebrities who 
grew up speaking foreign languages.

14
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:52,484
For example.
Well,

15
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:56,560
Natalie Portman was born in Jerusalem 
and she is fluent in Hebrew.

16
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:57,863
Good.

17
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:03,003
And Leonardo Dicaprio speaks German 
because his family on his mother's side 

18
00:01:05,981 --> 00:01:07,770
is from Germany,
not mine,

19
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:10,570
almost from a [inaudible],
uh,

20
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,350
uh,
switched him to Vec from Dusseldorf.

21
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:14,423
But there are also lots of famous people
who have learned foreign languages as 

22
00:01:17,641 --> 00:01:18,474
teens or adults.
One example is will Smith who speak 

23
00:01:21,251 --> 00:01:22,680
Spanish?
Let's have a look.

24
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:24,990
No,
uh,

25
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:29,370
uh,
uh,

26
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:34,380
and up to two zero k and this is 
[inaudible].

27
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,173
Okay,
so maybe we'll smith doesn't seem 

28
00:01:37,501 --> 00:01:39,630
completely fluent in Spanish,
but that's all right.

29
00:01:39,631 --> 00:01:42,600
He seems to have the basics down.
He has a working knowledge of Spanish.

30
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:43,643
He is on record as saying that he 
studies Spanish in order to do 

31
00:01:47,101 --> 00:01:50,580
interviews for his fans around the world
who speak Spanish.

32
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:51,563
I think the lesson we can take from will
smith is that having a very specific 

33
00:01:54,811 --> 00:01:57,030
functional goal in mind for the 
language,

34
00:01:57,031 --> 00:01:57,864
having a real functional reason to use 
the language is a great external 

35
00:02:00,991 --> 00:02:01,824
motivator to study it.
Maybe he doesn't have a personal 

36
00:02:04,261 --> 00:02:05,094
cultural interest in studying Spanish,
but that professional goal of giving 

37
00:02:08,431 --> 00:02:12,060
interviews in Spanish motivates him to 
study and he's constantly improving.

38
00:02:12,061 --> 00:02:15,510
So I think it's working.
Another person is Bradley Cooper who was

39
00:02:15,511 --> 00:02:17,640
fluent in French.
Let's take a look.

40
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:20,050
Mia,
CBL plumbism he posted,

41
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,040
oh,
sit by me buck to us.

42
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:24,874
It didn't new laws,
they've got more superpose you have a 

43
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,740
bubble set us up.
[inaudible]

44
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,083
now,
Bradley Cooper clearly speaks French 

45
00:02:31,171 --> 00:02:32,004
very well.
He often gives interviews in the French 

46
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:34,650
Press,
the French media.

47
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:38,100
He says that he studied abroad in France
when he was a teenager.

48
00:02:38,101 --> 00:02:38,934
He lived there for six months and was 
basically immersed in the French 

49
00:02:41,941 --> 00:02:42,774
language.
So I think the lesson that we can take 

50
00:02:44,191 --> 00:02:45,024
from Bradley Cooper is that living in 
the country where that language is 

51
00:02:48,451 --> 00:02:49,284
spoken,
living amongst people who speak it with 

52
00:02:50,821 --> 00:02:51,654
you everyday,
being immersed is one of the best ways 

53
00:02:53,761 --> 00:02:56,130
that you can solidify your language 
skills.

54
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:59,950
Another person is Gwyneth paltrow who 
speaks fluent Spanish.

55
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:00,813
Let's take a look

56
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:06,480
[inaudible] job,
eh,

57
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:12,520
we're not.
I own opportunity Spania as to the Rie.

58
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:13,733
What does paltrow says that she went to 
Mexico when she was a teenager and she 

59
00:03:16,811 --> 00:03:17,644
fell in love with the country and she 
started to study the language and that 

60
00:03:20,261 --> 00:03:22,900
she's been back there on a regular basis
ever since then.

61
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,913
And even to this day,
she still speaks Spanish regularly and 

62
00:03:26,021 --> 00:03:28,810
she says she even speak Spanish to her 
kids sometimes.

63
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:29,943
So I think what we can learn from her is
that really falling in love with a 

64
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:33,754
culture and making that culture a part 
of your life and a part of who you are 

65
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:37,623
is a great way to also get motivated to 
study that language and make the 

66
00:03:40,781 --> 00:03:43,750
language a part of yourself and your 
life.

67
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:46,510
It's not really difficult to do that if 
you love the culture,

68
00:03:46,511 --> 00:03:47,344
you don't even need to push yourself 
because you'll always just enjoy 

69
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,333
studying that language and enjoy getting
to know the culture even more than you 

70
00:03:54,221 --> 00:03:57,280
currently do.
Now the next person is not a movie star,

71
00:03:57,281 --> 00:03:58,114
not a Hollywood star,
but she's still very famous and you 

72
00:04:00,011 --> 00:04:02,350
still know who she is and that's jk 
rowling,

73
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,350
who was the author of the Harry Potter 
Series Of course,

74
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:09,550
and she is filthy fucking rich.
Jk Rowling,

75
00:04:09,551 --> 00:04:11,710
can't speak French,
let's have a look.

76
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:12,843
Good idea because you're pulling slam 
every t [inaudible] apple in 

77
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:20,470
significance to particularly air it say 
personnel.

78
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,880
Constable explicate on stone.

79
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,253
Jk Rowling majored in French in 
university and part of her program was 

80
00:04:27,231 --> 00:04:28,064
to spend a year abroad in Paris studying
the language and she was also a French 

81
00:04:32,391 --> 00:04:36,870
teacher in the UK for a while before she
became filthy rich.

82
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:37,763
So similar to Bradley Cooper.
I think the lesson that we can learn 

83
00:04:40,051 --> 00:04:40,884
from jk rowling is that immersion in the
country will immersion amongst the 

84
00:04:44,311 --> 00:04:48,000
language that you want to learn is one 
of the best ways to solidify your skills

85
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,073
and to become good at that language.
Another lesson that we can learn from 

86
00:04:52,111 --> 00:04:57,111
her is that learning a foreign language 
will make you filthy rich.

87
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,040
Well,
maybe not,

88
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:00,720
but hey,
I can dream right,

89
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,560
and this last person is also not a 
Hollywood star,

90
00:05:04,561 --> 00:05:07,710
but this person is huge and it is mark 
Zuckerberg.

91
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,753
Of course,
we all know mark Zuckerberg is the 

92
00:05:10,051 --> 00:05:10,884
founder of facebook and he made big 
headlines last year by speaking at a 

93
00:05:13,861 --> 00:05:14,694
conference in China in Mandarin.
He actually did an interview with an 

94
00:05:17,671 --> 00:05:19,860
interviewer in Mandarin for about 30 
minutes.

95
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:20,694
Let's take a look.

96
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,610
You're jumping in.
She jumped.

97
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,540
She kind of,

98
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,533
okay,
so it doesn't seem like mark is 

99
00:05:38,981 --> 00:05:42,430
completely fluent in Mandarin,
but he seems to have the basics down.

100
00:05:42,431 --> 00:05:44,110
He's got a working knowledge of the 
language.

101
00:05:44,111 --> 00:05:48,340
He seems to be able to answer questions 
and express himself so it is what it is.

102
00:05:48,341 --> 00:05:49,960
He'll continue to improve.
I'm sure.

103
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,410
I don't know how he studied or studies 
the language,

104
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:54,483
but his reasons for studying the 
language are interesting and those are 

105
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:57,943
lessons in and of themselves.
His first reason for studying the 

106
00:06:00,141 --> 00:06:04,220
language is that his wife is of Chinese 
descent and he wants to communicate with

107
00:06:04,221 --> 00:06:05,054
her family,
so that shows us that having a specific 

108
00:06:07,731 --> 00:06:11,000
group of people that you really want to 
communicate with in that language,

109
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,570
that's a great motivator to push you to 
learn the language.

110
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:15,613
His second reason for learning the 
language is that China is a great 

111
00:06:18,351 --> 00:06:21,200
country,
a great culture and a great civilization

112
00:06:21,201 --> 00:06:22,700
and he wants to learn more about it.

113
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:23,893
I think what he says that that's a 
veiled way of saying that he wants to 

114
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:29,930
get facebook into China because it's 
such an important place,

115
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:32,240
but if we take what he says at face 
value,

116
00:06:32,241 --> 00:06:33,074
then of course wanting to know more 
about an important culture is a great 

117
00:06:35,961 --> 00:06:39,560
motivation,
but if his main point is to get facebook

118
00:06:39,561 --> 00:06:42,110
into China than that too,
that kind of goal,

119
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:44,270
having an important business goal like 
that,

120
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:45,283
that is also a powerful external 
motivator to get you studying a 

121
00:06:48,171 --> 00:06:49,004
language.
His third reason for studying mandarin 

122
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:51,374
is that he enjoys challenges and he 
thinks mandarin is a challenging 

123
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:54,891
language.
Now,

124
00:06:54,891 --> 00:06:58,910
think about that attitude for a second.
That's really an attitude of success.

125
00:06:59,090 --> 00:06:59,923
If you think that challenge is bad,
if you think that anything difficult or 

126
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,300
anything that makes you uncomfortable as
bad,

127
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:06,283
then you're going to shy away from 
learning a language because it's 

128
00:07:08,271 --> 00:07:12,230
sometimes necessary to break out of your
comfort zone to learn a language.

129
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:13,243
But if you embrace that,
if you see that as getting yourself 

130
00:07:15,081 --> 00:07:16,360
fired up for,
you know,

131
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:17,323
as making yourself more powerful by 
fighting through some kind of challenge 

132
00:07:20,591 --> 00:07:21,424
of difficulty than that,
that's just an attitude that can propel 

133
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:27,380
you forward rather than making you shy 
away from learning a language.

134
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,350
None of these people are known mainly 
for their language skills,

135
00:07:30,351 --> 00:07:31,184
right?
They're all known mainly for some other 

136
00:07:32,691 --> 00:07:36,860
talent or skill or creation that they've
contributed to the world and they're all

137
00:07:36,861 --> 00:07:39,020
really quite busy focusing on those 
things.

138
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:42,530
But the fact that they can become good 
at a foreign language,

139
00:07:42,531 --> 00:07:43,364
even though they're focused on this 
other central goal that shows you that 

140
00:07:45,681 --> 00:07:47,990
you can do it too.
So take them as examples.

141
00:07:47,991 --> 00:07:51,890
People we can learn from people we can 
be inspired by and motivated by.

142
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:56,270
A lot of people like to watch famous 
people and observe their lives,

143
00:07:56,271 --> 00:07:58,370
but don't just watch them as observers.

144
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:02,300
I want you to actually learn something 
from them and emulate the good qualities

145
00:08:02,301 --> 00:08:04,970
of those people are right.
This is Paul from length focus.

146
00:08:04,971 --> 00:08:07,310
I hope you enjoyed this video.
Have a nice night.

147
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,153
Talk to you later in French has been the
easiest language that I have personally 

148
00:08:13,101 --> 00:08:13,934
studied.
I used to think it was Indonesian 

149
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,520
because Indonesia is really simple.
In the future.

150
00:08:18,521 --> 00:08:19,354
Beyond that,
you can see the next goal in front of 

151
00:08:21,161 --> 00:08:21,994
you,
which is to start learning Spanish or 

152
00:08:23,141 --> 00:08:25,450
whatever your language of interest 
gives,

153
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:26,523
but just think of it like that.
Like you're not discarding those goals 

154
00:08:29,381 --> 00:08:30,214
are discarding those missions you are.
You were kind of putting them off into 

155
00:08:33,251 --> 00:08:34,084
the future and you'll get to them later.
But your primary mission right now is 

156
00:08:37,241 --> 00:08:39,550
this one.
What you need to accomplish first before

157
00:08:39,551 --> 00:08:41,110
you can get to that future mission.
