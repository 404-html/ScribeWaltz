Today I think I'll compare Portuguese 
with a special dialect of Portuguese 

2
00:00:05,551 --> 00:00:06,690
called Spanish.

3
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:15,613
Hello everyone.
Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and 

4
00:00:17,421 --> 00:00:18,254
my name is Paul.
Today's topic is how similar or Spanish 

5
00:00:21,111 --> 00:00:23,390
and Portuguese,
as you probably know,

6
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:24,253
Spanish and Portuguese are both Ibero 
Romance languages that share a common 

7
00:00:27,831 --> 00:00:30,260
origin.
There are different enough that they are

8
00:00:30,261 --> 00:00:32,330
definitely considered different 
languages,

9
00:00:32,331 --> 00:00:35,930
but they're also closely related and 
quite similar in many ways.

10
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,033
On paper,
the two languages look very similar and 

11
00:00:38,841 --> 00:00:39,674
speakers of either language can 
generally read the other language 

12
00:00:42,201 --> 00:00:45,140
without too much trouble.
The spoken language is however,

13
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,033
are more different from each other and 
less mutually intelligible than the 

14
00:00:48,801 --> 00:00:49,634
written forms and Portuguese speakers 
typically understand spoken Spanish 

15
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,313
better than Spanish speakers understand 
Portuguese because Portuguese speakers 

16
00:00:57,861 --> 00:01:00,320
as smart.
Well actually it's mostly because of the

17
00:01:00,321 --> 00:01:02,810
difference in pronunciation between the 
two languages,

18
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,673
but we'll get into that a little later.
Spanish and Portuguese share about 89 

19
00:01:06,951 --> 00:01:07,784
percent lexical similarity,
meaning that 89 percent of the words 

20
00:01:10,881 --> 00:01:13,790
have a cognate or an equivalent in the 
other language.

21
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:16,310
Now,
that doesn't always mean that 89 percent

22
00:01:16,311 --> 00:01:17,144
of the words will be the same because 
some of the different words are very 

23
00:01:19,881 --> 00:01:23,630
basic and common words,
and even though cognate words often look

24
00:01:23,631 --> 00:01:24,464
and sound quite similar,
there are other cognates that have 

25
00:01:26,241 --> 00:01:29,390
developed quite differently and now 
sound and look quite different.

26
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:30,343
For instance,
this pair of cognates clearly resemble 

27
00:01:32,271 --> 00:01:35,600
each other in Spanish and in Portuguese.
