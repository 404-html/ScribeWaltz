00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:01,143
Back in 2013,
I produced one of the strangest videos 

2
00:00:04,151 --> 00:00:04,984
on youtube,
a video about Arabic in Japanese with 

3
00:00:07,421 --> 00:00:11,410
English subtitles and me teaching in 
Arabic lesson to Japanese viewers.

4
00:00:11,411 --> 00:00:14,950
At the end,
lots of people were bewildered today.

5
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,030
I'm going to try it again.

6
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:22,310
Okay.

7
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:23,143
Hello everyone.
Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and 

8
00:00:24,981 --> 00:00:25,814
my name is Paul.
Today's topic is the Arabic language or 

9
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:31,723
as it's called in Arabic.
Arabic is the fifth most widely spoken 

10
00:00:34,971 --> 00:00:35,804
language in the world with $293 million 
native speakers in 422 million speakers 

11
00:00:41,001 --> 00:00:41,834
in total.
It's an official language in 26 

12
00:00:43,641 --> 00:00:44,474
countries.
That doesn't mean it's the majority 

13
00:00:45,891 --> 00:00:49,160
language in all of those countries,
but it's one of the official languages.

14
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:50,203
It is also one of the six official 
languages of the United Nations and 

15
00:00:53,361 --> 00:00:56,150
that's the language of the Quran,
the holy book of Islam.

16
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:57,043
It is also the liturgical language of 
one point 7 billion Muslims around the 

17
00:01:00,321 --> 00:01:02,630
world.
Most of those people don't speak Arabic,

18
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:06,590
but many have some knowledge of Arabic 
for reading and for reciting prayers and

19
00:01:06,591 --> 00:01:07,424
religious study.
Speaking about Arabic can be confusing 

20
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,320
because there are many different 
varieties of the language.

21
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,200
One of the main varieties is the 
classical Arabic of the coo,

22
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:15,710
Dan.

23
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:19,790
This is considered by many to be the 
most perfect form of Arabic and some say

24
00:01:19,791 --> 00:01:20,624
it's the only true Arabic because it was
the language in which God revealed that 

25
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:24,963
to Mohammed.
Then there's modern standard Arabic 

26
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:30,170
which is the form of Arabic used as an 
official language today.

27
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:31,243
It's the modern form of literary Arabic 
which was based on the classical Arabic 

28
00:01:34,371 --> 00:01:35,204
of the coo,
Dan,

29
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:36,043
but with some adaptations and a greatly 
expanded vocabulary to make it more 

30
00:01:39,111 --> 00:01:39,944
suitable for modern times.
It's not exactly the same as classical 

31
00:01:42,711 --> 00:01:43,544
Arabic,
but both of them are referred to by 

32
00:01:44,631 --> 00:01:45,464
Arabs as hot meaning eloquent speech.
Modern Standard Arabic is the language 

33
00:01:49,941 --> 00:01:51,080
of books,
media,

34
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:55,340
education and formal situations but not 
as the language of everyday speech.

35
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:58,880
For everyday speech,
Arabic speakers use their local dialects

36
00:01:58,940 --> 00:01:59,773
or which can differ quite significantly 
from country to country and even from 

37
00:02:04,311 --> 00:02:05,330
one place to another.

38
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:08,240
Within a single country.
Arabic is a Semitic language,

39
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,760
Arabic and other Semitic languages like 
Hebrew,

40
00:02:10,761 --> 00:02:12,080
Aramaic,
and Phoenician,

41
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,990
all developed from the same protose 
Semitic language,

42
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,360
Arabic forms,
one branch of central submitting,

43
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:20,150
while another branch of central Semitic 
includes Hebrew,

44
00:02:20,151 --> 00:02:21,320
Aramaic,
and Phoenician,

45
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:22,903
old Arabic,
numerous Semitic languages related to 

46
00:02:25,191 --> 00:02:29,370
Arabic were spoken in Arabia between the
13th at Tenth Century Ce,

47
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:32,510
but they don't have features that would 
classify them as Arabic.

48
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:37,310
The earliest evidence of people referred
to as Arab is in an Assyrian inscription

49
00:02:37,311 --> 00:02:40,790
from the eighth century bce,
but it just mentions the Arabs.

50
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:41,624
It doesn't give any examples of their 
language from the sixth century bce to 

51
00:02:44,901 --> 00:02:48,470
the fourth century ce,
we have inscriptions showing evidence of

52
00:02:48,471 --> 00:02:49,304
an early form of Arabic.
Some of those inscriptions are written 

53
00:02:51,501 --> 00:02:54,740
in that early form of Arabic and others 
are written in Aramaic,

54
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:56,570
but show some influence from Arabic.

55
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:59,500
Those inscriptions consists mostly of 
proper names,

56
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:00,363
so they don't give us an awful lot of 
information about what the language was 

57
00:03:02,951 --> 00:03:03,784
like.
The earliest inscription that is 

58
00:03:05,081 --> 00:03:10,060
unmistakably Arabic is from the first 
century bce and was found at enough that

59
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:13,900
it's an Aramaic inscription,
but it contains three lines of Arabic.

60
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,033
Another inscription was discovered at 
end the Mazda 120 kilometers southeast 

61
00:03:19,001 --> 00:03:22,080
of Damascus dating back to three slash 
29 slash ce.

62
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:23,343
The language of this inscription is 
nearly identical to classical Arabic as 

63
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:27,154
we know it,
even though these inscriptions are 

64
00:03:28,421 --> 00:03:29,254
unmistakably written in Arabic,
they are not written in the Arabic 

65
00:03:31,721 --> 00:03:32,554
script,
but rather the Nabataeans script which 

66
00:03:34,421 --> 00:03:38,590
derived from the Aramaic script,
but there are also inscriptions from the

67
00:03:38,591 --> 00:03:39,424
fourth and fifth century Ce that are 
written in a script that's more like 

68
00:03:42,311 --> 00:03:43,144
Arabic.
It's generally thought that the Arabic 

69
00:03:44,741 --> 00:03:45,574
script developed from the Nabataeans 
script and these inscriptions might be 

70
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:52,450
written in a script that somewhere 
between those two classical Arabic,

71
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,673
before the beginning of Islam,
there were numerous dialects of Arabic 

72
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:57,124
spoken around the peninsula,
but there was also a common literary 

73
00:03:59,501 --> 00:04:02,170
language used among the different tribes
for poetry,

74
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:05,740
a coin it which was a compromise between
the various dialects.

75
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:06,813
The pieces of poetry written in this 
literary coin a are the earliest 

76
00:04:09,641 --> 00:04:10,474
examples of classical Arabic.
The Koran was written in the seventh 

77
00:04:13,001 --> 00:04:13,834
century when Muslims believe that the 
Qur'an was revealed to Muhammad by the 

78
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:18,783
Angel Gabriel,
and then it was written down over a 23 

79
00:04:20,381 --> 00:04:22,780
year period.
At the time the Koran was written,

80
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,210
there were seven dialects of classical 
Arabic.

81
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,333
The Koran was written in all of them,
but the ice version became the standard 

82
00:04:29,651 --> 00:04:32,350
upon which the text of today's call is 
based.

83
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:36,010
The differences are in pronunciation,
not in vocabulary or grammar.

84
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:36,993
The Arabic of the [inaudible] is similar
to that of the pre-islamic classical 

85
00:04:40,091 --> 00:04:40,924
Arabic poetry,
but not exactly beginning during the 

86
00:04:43,151 --> 00:04:46,120
life of Mohammed and continuing into the
18th century,

87
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:50,230
the Islamic conquest spread the Arabic 
language into new faraway lands.

88
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,333
After the Islamic conquest,
there was an important need to 

89
00:04:53,381 --> 00:04:54,214
standardize the language because of vast
numbers of people were beginning to 

90
00:04:56,891 --> 00:04:57,550
speak it.

91
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,260
The script was made,
more practical.

92
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,153
New Vocabulary was created and the 
grammar and style of pro is West 

93
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,390
standardized.
Neo,

94
00:05:04,391 --> 00:05:05,224
Arabic and middle Arabic.
Classical Arabic was being standardized 

95
00:05:08,261 --> 00:05:11,890
as a written language.
Local dialects of Arabic also emerged in

96
00:05:11,891 --> 00:05:12,724
the cities of the Arab empire.
These dialects did not descend directly 

97
00:05:15,611 --> 00:05:16,444
from classical Arabic,
but rather from pre-islamic Arabic 

98
00:05:18,821 --> 00:05:19,654
dialects or from a single Arabic coin,
which was the common language of 

99
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:24,124
conquering Arab armies.
These new dialects were also influenced 

100
00:05:26,891 --> 00:05:29,560
by the original languages of areas that 
were conquered.

101
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:33,490
The dialects of the lavant and 
Mesopotamia were influenced by Aramaic.

102
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,430
The dialects of the Maghreb were 
influenced by Berber.

103
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,790
The dialects of Egypt were influenced by
Coptic and so on.

104
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,200
The early centuries of these newly 
emerging dialects are referred to as neo

105
00:05:44,201 --> 00:05:45,034
Arabic,
even though classical Arabic was 

106
00:05:46,481 --> 00:05:49,120
standardized,
not everybody could write it perfectly.

107
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,223
Writing that contains features of both 
classical Arabic and neo Arabic or 

108
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:58,370
dialects is referred to as middle Arabic
middle refer to a time period,

109
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,233
but rather these texts were somewhere in
the middle between classical and 

110
00:06:01,641 --> 00:06:03,410
colloquial modern Arabic.

111
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:04,423
Over the centuries,
the neo Arabic dialects continued to 

112
00:06:06,801 --> 00:06:09,500
evolve into the modern colloquial 
dialects of today,

113
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:14,260
but literary Arabic remains relatively 
constant because the Arabic of the Koran

114
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,223
was always seen as the ideal Arabic to 
imitate and this probably had a 

115
00:06:18,531 --> 00:06:22,430
conservative effect on the dialects 
limiting them from changing too much.

116
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,383
After Napoleon entered Egypt in 1798,
the Arab world entered a period of 

117
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:28,124
greater contact with the West.
The influx of new western concepts 

118
00:06:31,131 --> 00:06:35,060
required the Arabic language to be 
updated in the early 20th century,

119
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,953
regional academies of the Arabic 
language began a process of language 

120
00:06:38,901 --> 00:06:43,220
reform focused mainly on expanding and 
updating the languages vocabulary.

121
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:44,203
These updates culminated in what is now 
known as modern standard Arabic die 

122
00:06:47,691 --> 00:06:48,524
glossier.
Arabic is well known for its state of 

123
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:51,403
glossier.
Arabic speakers used two distinctly 

124
00:06:53,451 --> 00:06:56,930
different forms of the language in 
parallel for different purposes.

125
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:00,680
Modern standard Arabic is not learned by
anyone as a native language,

126
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:01,663
but it's used in reading and writing and
media on children's TV shows ended 

127
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:05,923
formal speeches,
while the colloquial dialects are used 

128
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:10,220
almost universally for daily 
conversation.

129
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:13,430
As I mentioned before,
there's quite a lot of variation amongst

130
00:07:13,431 --> 00:07:14,264
Arabic dialects.
How well two speakers understand each 

131
00:07:16,521 --> 00:07:17,354
other,
depends on the geographic distance of 

132
00:07:18,711 --> 00:07:19,544
their dialects as well as exposure.
Many Arabic speakers have told me that 

133
00:07:22,671 --> 00:07:23,504
speakers up the Middle Eastern dialects 
really have no trouble understanding 

134
00:07:26,301 --> 00:07:27,134
each other and that the main trouble 
comes in understanding the my grubby 

135
00:07:29,601 --> 00:07:31,340
dialects,
especially Moroccan,

136
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:34,490
but these days with the spread of cable 
TV and the Internet,

137
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:35,383
people are being exposed to a wider 
range of dialects on a more regular 

138
00:07:38,181 --> 00:07:39,014
basis,
which helps people understand different 

139
00:07:40,221 --> 00:07:44,690
dialects more and of course there's also
our facade modern standard Arabic.

140
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:48,260
When speakers have significantly 
different dialects communicate with each

141
00:07:48,261 --> 00:07:49,094
other,
they can switch the modern standard 

142
00:07:50,151 --> 00:07:50,984
Arabic or they can adjust their speech 
to make it more formal and literary and 

143
00:07:54,231 --> 00:07:55,064
similar to modern standard Arabic,
but not exactly another common way for 

144
00:07:58,131 --> 00:08:02,030
native speakers to bridge the dialect 
gap is to use something called the white

145
00:08:02,031 --> 00:08:02,864
dialect,
which is a more formal version of 

146
00:08:04,191 --> 00:08:05,024
dialectal speech that uses features that
are common to most of the different 

147
00:08:08,301 --> 00:08:09,134
dialects,
but it leaves out features that are 

148
00:08:10,341 --> 00:08:12,020
limited to specific dialects.

149
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,680
This is essentially a modern Arabic coin
a,

150
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:15,703
so what's Arabic like?
Let's take a look at some features of 

151
00:08:18,411 --> 00:08:20,840
Arabic focusing on modern standard 
Arabic.

152
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:21,913
The script,
the Arabic script is written from right 

153
00:08:23,901 --> 00:08:27,050
to left and consists of letters that 
imitate handwriting.

154
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,900
Most letters joined to the letter that 
comes after them.

155
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,090
However,
a few letters remain disjoined.

156
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:33,853
The letters that joined have two forms,
one short form at the beginning or in 

157
00:08:37,071 --> 00:08:40,280
the middle of words and another long 
form at the end of words,

158
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:44,960
or when the letter is by itself.
The Arabic script is an abject,

159
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:45,913
meaning that each letter represents a 
consonant and that short vowels are not 

160
00:08:48,591 --> 00:08:52,370
really written in that long.
Vowels and diphthongs can be ambiguous.

161
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,100
How can we read Arabic without vowels?
Well,

162
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:55,973
can you read this here at the short,
vowels are not written and the other 

163
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:02,640
seems somewhat incomplete,
but we have a hint about what the vowels

164
00:09:02,641 --> 00:09:03,330
are.

165
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:04,163
This is kind of like reading Arabic,
but Arabic has more predictable vowel 

166
00:09:06,991 --> 00:09:09,210
patterns than English,
so it's easier to guess.

167
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,433
Also Arabic can be written with how cat,
which are extra diacritic markings that 

168
00:09:14,431 --> 00:09:15,264
indicate the short vowel sounds.
These are generally only used in texts 

169
00:09:18,301 --> 00:09:22,020
that are really important to pronounce 
perfectly like the [inaudible] or poetry

170
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:24,900
or children's materials.
Phonology.

171
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,213
Arabic has a number of consonant sounds 
which are surprising or challenging for 

172
00:09:29,221 --> 00:09:31,650
speakers of many other languages.
For example,

173
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:37,670
as in the word meaning Gulf.
Then there's off as in the word pin.

174
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:42,360
This is like the k but pronounced 
further back in your throat.

175
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:48,350
Then there's the letter ha,
like in the word meaning hot in some say

176
00:09:49,231 --> 00:09:51,750
that this is similar to the French are 
sound.

177
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,673
For example,
the word meaning room Arabic also has a 

178
00:09:56,491 --> 00:09:59,280
number of infected consonants.
For example,

179
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:02,460
there's a scene which is like the 
regular s sound in English,

180
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:06,660
but there is also sod,
which is an emphatic s as in the word,

181
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,550
meaning small.

182
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:11,850
Also notice design in the middle.
To make this sound,

183
00:10:11,851 --> 00:10:14,400
do you have to keep your tongue close to
the roof of your mouth.

184
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,293
If you want to try it,
position your mouth as though you are 

185
00:10:17,071 --> 00:10:19,590
going to say a pe and hold that 
position.

186
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:21,360
Then make an s sound.
Instead,

187
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:22,403
go ahead and try it.
Saw saw there are three other emphatic 

188
00:10:26,281 --> 00:10:31,281
consonants to an emphatic,
tall dog and zoll morphology.

189
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,630
Arabic words are mostly constructed from
three letter routes or sometimes four,

190
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:37,763
and these letters are then inserted into
templates consisting of a fixed vowel 

191
00:10:41,071 --> 00:10:44,790
pattern and some structural consonance.
If you know the route letters,

192
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:48,690
you can identify the core meaning of the
word and if you know the template,

193
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:53,430
you know what type of word it is.
Let's take the root ca at a gym,

194
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,480
which means to go out or to exit,
and let's put it into this template.

195
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:00,200
We get the word mythology,
which is the noun,

196
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,040
meaning exit,
like adore you,

197
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:02,874
exit through.
This template indicates a place where 

198
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:08,610
the action of the root is done.
If we use the root data,

199
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:11,490
Ha Lem,
which means to come in,

200
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,810
we get mad.
The honey,

201
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:14,003
which means entrance.
If we use the root cath to bet we get 

202
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:20,363
the meaning office.
These kinds of recurring templates help 

203
00:11:23,191 --> 00:11:26,670
you to know how to pronounce words even 
when the short vowels are not written.

204
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:27,743
If you see the letter meme followed by 
three route letters altogether with no 

205
00:11:30,901 --> 00:11:31,734
long vowels,
you can guess that the word is in this 

206
00:11:33,271 --> 00:11:36,000
template and pronounce it with too short
a vowels.

207
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:40,410
Verbs in Arabic are part of this same 
system of roots and templates.

208
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:44,310
The templates tell us the tense person,
gender and number of the verb,

209
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,620
and the root provides us the core 
meaning.

210
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:47,693
Again,
let's take the route at a gym and pump 

211
00:11:50,851 --> 00:11:55,510
it into this template here and we get,
and we know what this means.

212
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,610
It's the past tense.
Third Person,

213
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,350
masculine,
singular conjugation.

214
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:00,490
He exited.

215
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:07,780
This means he exited the school.
Now put the route into this template.

216
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:10,600
What this means,
I exited.

217
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:14,400
This suffix here indicates past tense,
first person singular out,

218
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,800
assuming that this means I exited the 
office.

219
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,080
If we put it into this template,
yes,

220
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,330
it means he exits.
This is the present tense template.

221
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:32,590
This means he exits the office.
I mean they exit.

222
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:36,363
This means they will exit the office.
The sentences in the future tense to 

223
00:12:39,671 --> 00:12:41,770
change the present tense,
the future tense.

224
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:46,000
You simply add the suffix psa to the 
beginning of the present tense template.

225
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:51,210
Sap is used for near future and a 
separate particle so far is used for the

226
00:12:51,431 --> 00:12:54,520
more distant future.
Arabic has no other verb tenses,

227
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:58,540
only past and present and future which 
uses the present tense conjugation.

228
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,380
This submittal system of roots and 
templates is really quite intuitive once

229
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:03,214
you get used to it,
and it's quite ingenious if you ask me 

230
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,130
word order.

231
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:06,963
Modern standard Arabic is a vsl language
by default as opposed to Arabic 

232
00:13:10,931 --> 00:13:13,120
dialects,
which are mainly Svo.

233
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:18,220
You had this means the man is studying 
Arabic.

234
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:21,220
Here's the verb,
the subject and the object.

235
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:25,480
These are the definite article,
but before certain letters,

236
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:29,230
the lamb or the l sound assimilates to 
the following letter,

237
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:33,580
so I'll Rajul becomes our agile.
This is the basic word order,

238
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:37,450
but Svo is also possible in a sentence 
with a pronoun.

239
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,940
VSL is not possible,
for example,

240
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,790
and a sofa.
A lot of.

241
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,633
Yeah,
this means I will study Arabic in the 

242
00:13:44,711 --> 00:13:48,370
future.
You can't say Sofa and a lot of Va.

243
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:52,450
You can either say it with the pronoun 
first or with no pronouns,

244
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:53,343
just sofa because the verb conjugation 
tells us that this is the first person 

245
00:13:57,881 --> 00:14:00,850
singular,
so we don't need the pronoun cases.

246
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:05,290
One aspect of standard arabic is cases.
There are three cases in arabic.

247
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:06,183
Nominative genitive and accusative 
announced takes special endings to show 

248
00:14:09,941 --> 00:14:12,760
their function in the sentence.
Let's take the word keY tab,

249
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,930
which means book in nominative.
It's taboo in genitive.

250
00:14:16,931 --> 00:14:20,140
It's keith rabie in accusative.
It's tabba.

251
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:23,703
This means the excellent book.
The noun key tab is in the nominative 

252
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:31,260
and the adjective is also inflicted to 
agree with the noun and then upload will

253
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,690
keep.
This means I am reading a book here.

254
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,630
Github is in the accusative and it's 
indefinite.

255
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:42,330
The end sound at the end here indicates 
that it's indefinite will.

256
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:46,150
This means so the author of the book 
here,

257
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,013
key tab is in the genitive case.
These cases and things are not used at 

258
00:14:49,901 --> 00:14:50,734
the end of a sentence,
but only when the word is followed by 

259
00:14:52,701 --> 00:14:53,534
something.
the form at the end of a sentence 

260
00:14:54,891 --> 00:14:57,460
without a case ending is called the 
Puzzle form.

261
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:01,520
These case endings are often not used in
modern standard arabic.

262
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:04,400
They're generally only used in prepared 
texts are prepared.

263
00:15:04,401 --> 00:15:06,410
Speeches,
two more sentences.

264
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:13,190
This means I usually don't work on 
saturday word for word.

265
00:15:13,191 --> 00:15:16,550
it's usually no,
I work day.

266
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,473
The saturday.
That is the negation particle used for 

267
00:15:20,571 --> 00:15:21,404
the present tense.
Amen is the verb for work and its root 

268
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,273
is.
I'm meme lem and this is the first 

269
00:15:27,891 --> 00:15:30,320
person singular present tense,
conjugation,

270
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:31,423
yelm and accept around [inaudible].
So together they mean the day of 

271
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:35,684
saturday you'd offer is a construction 
of two nouns side by side to show 

272
00:15:39,351 --> 00:15:40,850
possession.
Fun fact.

273
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:43,790
The word sabbath comes from the hebrew 
word shabbat,

274
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:46,180
which is related to this arabic word 
sept.

275
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:48,283
Who would say,
this means I'll drive my car to the 

276
00:15:51,921 --> 00:15:56,921
office word for word.
It's will I drive my car to the office.

277
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,153
Remember,
saw is added to the present tense verb 

278
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:04,700
to form the future of food contains the 
verb cough while dad,

279
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:07,340
and this is the first person singular 
present tense,

280
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:08,510
conjugation,
sayada.

281
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:11,900
It is the word sayada with a possessive 
suffix,

282
00:16:11,901 --> 00:16:14,810
meaning my at the end and when a suffix 
is added,

283
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:19,930
the letter had becomes a tad.
Isla is a preposition showing direction.

284
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:23,720
The elbow here or the lamb is the 
definite article al,

285
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,260
but the a sound or the eleaf assimilates
to the proceeding.

286
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:29,270
Long a.
As you can see,

287
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,133
arabic is a fascinating language with 
lots of interesting features from its 

288
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:36,410
script to it's phonology to its root and
template system.

289
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:39,500
It's a language that often seems 
intimidating to learners,

290
00:16:39,501 --> 00:16:40,334
but that's partly because modern 
standard arabic materials are aimed at 

291
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,113
reading and writing and grammar rather 
than on communication materials for 

292
00:16:47,181 --> 00:16:50,360
learning arabic dialects tend to be more
fun and communicative.

293
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:54,500
The question that's asked over and over 
and over is what form of arabic should I

294
00:16:54,501 --> 00:16:56,990
learn a dialect or a modern standard 
arabic,

295
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,093
in my opinion,
it's important to learn some modern 

296
00:16:59,481 --> 00:17:03,470
standard arabic either before you start 
to learn a dialect or at the same time,

297
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,780
but if you know some modern standard 
arabic,

298
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:06,733
it will help you to make sense of 
different dialects that you encounter 

299
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,093
and it will help you to understand 
different registers of speech even when 

300
00:17:12,801 --> 00:17:13,634
people are speaking in their dialects,
but if your main goal is communication 

301
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:20,240
than I don't think it's necessary to 
learn to speak modern standard arabic at

302
00:17:20,241 --> 00:17:21,074
a high level,
and that brings me to the question of 

303
00:17:24,231 --> 00:17:28,010
the day to native speakers of arabic and
to learners of arabic alike.

304
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:28,873
What do you think?
Which form of arabic is the best to 

305
00:17:30,861 --> 00:17:33,410
learn?
Modern standard arabic or a dialect?

306
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,750
Leave your answers in the comments down

307
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:38,090
Be sure to follow lang,
focus on facebook,

308
00:17:38,091 --> 00:17:39,290
twitter,
or instagram.

309
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:40,243
It's especially important these days 
because weird things are happening with 

310
00:17:42,921 --> 00:17:45,710
youtube and nobody's really sure what 
the future will bring,

311
00:17:45,711 --> 00:17:46,544
so it's good to have a way to be in 
touch with you outside of so I can let 

312
00:17:50,071 --> 00:17:50,904
you know what's happening with my videos
and in a worst case scenario where my 

313
00:17:54,121 --> 00:17:54,954
videos will be if not on youtube,
so be sure to follow me on at least one 

314
00:17:58,021 --> 00:17:58,854
of those and I want to say thanks again 
as usual to all of my patrion 

315
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:02,374
supporters,
especially these people right here on 

316
00:18:03,881 --> 00:18:06,490
the screen for their very helpful 
monthly pledges.

317
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,160
Thank you for watching and have a nice 
day.
