1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:00,893
Yeah.

2
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,360
Hello everyone.
Welcome to the Lange focus channel.

3
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:21,443
My name is Paul.
Today's topic is the languages of 

4
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,020
Belgium.
When most people think of Belgium,

5
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:29,780
they think of Belgian chocolate,
Belgian waffles,

6
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:30,673
Belgian beer and things like that,
but there is much more to Belgium than 

7
00:00:33,681 --> 00:00:34,514
those things,
including a very interesting linguistic 

8
00:00:36,231 --> 00:00:37,550
situation.
First,

9
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:41,960
let's get some geographic perspective.
Belgium is located in western Europe,

10
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:43,003
bordering France to the south and 
southwest Netherlands to the north and 

11
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:49,760
northeast Germany to the east and 
Luxembourg to the southeast.

12
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:54,200
This geographic location is reflected in
Belgium's linguistic diversity.

13
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:57,260
Belgium has three official languages,
Dutch,

14
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:00,020
which has historically been spoken by 
the Flemish people,

15
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:01,183
French,
which has historically been spoken by 

16
00:01:02,691 --> 00:01:03,524
the balloon people and German.
These three languages ended up being a 

17
00:01:07,101 --> 00:01:09,860
part of this one country because of 
Belgium's history.

18
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:14,120
The low countries which include Belgium,
the Netherlands and Luxembourg have been

19
00:01:14,121 --> 00:01:16,250
strategically important throughout the 
ages.

20
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:19,040
The low countries were ruled by a 
succession of rulers.

21
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:19,933
Eventually coming under the rule of the 
Spanish empire and 1556 and became 

22
00:01:23,691 --> 00:01:24,524
referred to as Spanish Netherlands.
The Dutch revolt of 1568 to 1581 

23
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:32,000
resulted in the independence of the 
northern provinces,

24
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:35,630
which became the Dutch republic,
which separated the Dutch from Belgium.

25
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:36,583
Even though the northern part of Belgium
spoke the same language with different 

26
00:01:39,321 --> 00:01:40,250
dialects.
Of course,

27
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,790
in 1713 after the Spanish war of 
succession,

28
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:44,893
the Spanish Netherlands,
the southern part minus the Dutch 

29
00:01:46,941 --> 00:01:47,774
republic came under Austrian control.
Then in 1794 it came under French 

30
00:01:51,891 --> 00:01:52,724
control and soon after that the Dutch 
republic was also brought under French 

31
00:01:56,031 --> 00:01:56,864
control.
After Napoleon's defeat the Napoleonic 

32
00:01:59,931 --> 00:02:00,764
wars,
the United Kingdom of the Netherlands 

33
00:02:02,241 --> 00:02:05,960
was created in 1815 which included 
present they Netherlands,

34
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,730
Belgium,
as well as Luxembourg.

35
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:09,373
After the Belgian revolution of 1830 the
kingdom of Belgium was created with the 

36
00:02:13,131 --> 00:02:14,090
support of France.

37
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:15,103
At first,
Belgium was a single state with one 

38
00:02:16,731 --> 00:02:17,564
official language French.
Even though the majority of people were 

39
00:02:19,851 --> 00:02:20,684
not French speakers in the 20th century,
a series of changes resulted in a 

40
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:26,810
federal system with three official 
languages.

41
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:28,223
Dutch just spoken as a native language 
by around 55% of the population and by 

42
00:02:32,211 --> 00:02:35,360
around 13% of the population as a second
language.

43
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:40,570
French is spoken as a native language by
approximately 36% of the population with

44
00:02:40,731 --> 00:02:44,570
about 45% of the population speaking at 
as a second language.

45
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:47,450
German is much less widely spoken as a 
native language.

46
00:02:47,451 --> 00:02:52,451
Then the other two by less than 1% what 
around 22% of the population speak it as

47
00:02:52,551 --> 00:02:53,384
a second language.
The three official languages are 

48
00:02:55,101 --> 00:02:58,250
generally concentrated in distinct 
linguistic areas.

49
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:01,510
Dutch is the language of the Flanders 
region in the north.

50
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:06,040
French is the primary language of the 
Wallonia region to the south with German

51
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:09,880
being the primary language of some areas
of eastern Wallonia near the border with

52
00:03:09,881 --> 00:03:10,714
Germany.

53
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,793
The Brussels Capitol region is 
officially bilingual with Dutch and 

54
00:03:14,501 --> 00:03:15,334
French being the two languages.
There are no official statistics about 

55
00:03:17,921 --> 00:03:20,350
the number of speakers of each language 
in the capital,

56
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:23,170
but it's quite obvious that French is 
the predominant language.

57
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:27,010
The Belgian federal state consists of 
three administrative regions,

58
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:28,360
Flanders,
Wallonia,

59
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:29,343
and the Brussels Capitol region,
as well as three federal communities 

60
00:03:32,201 --> 00:03:33,034
based on language.
The Flemish community has authority and 

61
00:03:35,261 --> 00:03:38,140
the Flemish provinces and in the 
Brussels capitol region.

62
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,260
The French community has authority and 
the balloon provinces,

63
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,333
with the exception of the German 
speaking municipalities as well as in 

64
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:45,874
the Brussels capitol region alongside 
the Flemish communities and the German 

65
00:03:49,031 --> 00:03:49,864
speaking community has authority and the
German speaking municipalities of the 

66
00:03:52,841 --> 00:03:53,674
province of lineage in Wallonia.
The areas administered by the German 

67
00:03:57,341 --> 00:03:58,174
speaking community are the areas given 
to Belgium by Germany in 1920 under the 

68
00:04:01,931 --> 00:04:02,764
treaty of Versailles,
the federal communities each have their 

69
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:05,644
own government and parliament,
which are distinct from the regional 

70
00:04:08,141 --> 00:04:09,280
government and parliament.

71
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:12,520
The governments of the communities have 
power over matters of culture,

72
00:04:12,521 --> 00:04:14,050
education,
health services,

73
00:04:14,051 --> 00:04:14,884
and social services.
That's in contrast with the regional 

74
00:04:17,111 --> 00:04:19,870
governments that have power over matters
of economy,

75
00:04:19,871 --> 00:04:21,520
infrastructure,
town planning,

76
00:04:21,521 --> 00:04:23,910
and so on and in the Brussels capitol 
regions,

77
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,753
the Flemish and French community 
governments and the regional government 

78
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:30,400
are merged together into one within the 
Flanders region.

79
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:34,720
Most municipalities offer services only 
in Dutch and in the Wallonia region.

80
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,840
Most municipalities offer services only 
in French,

81
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:38,943
but there are some municipalities with 
language facilities that also offer a 

82
00:04:42,191 --> 00:04:45,640
public services like schools and courts 
in another language as well.

83
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,713
These municipalities are typically those
bordering a different linguistic area 

84
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,673
administered by a different linguistic 
community or bordering the Brussels 

85
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:57,730
Capitol region.
There are 12 municipalities in flanders,

86
00:04:57,731 --> 00:04:58,564
which offers services in French,
six of which have a French speaking 

87
00:05:01,271 --> 00:05:03,640
majority and in French speaking 
Wallonia,

88
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,503
there are four municipalities offering 
services in Dutch and two more offering 

89
00:05:08,021 --> 00:05:08,854
services in German and all of the 
municipalities and the German speaking 

90
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:15,550
part of Wallonia offer services in 
French and in the Capitol region.

91
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:18,490
All services are offered in both French 
and in Dutch.

92
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,593
And I should note that all federal 
services are provided in all three 

93
00:05:22,091 --> 00:05:26,230
official languages at the national level
language varieties.

94
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,453
So we know that there are three official
languages with their respective 

95
00:05:29,861 --> 00:05:32,710
communities and areas,
but there's more to it than that.

96
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:33,963
One of the official languages is Dutch,
but is it the same as the Dutch spoken 

97
00:05:37,181 --> 00:05:38,014
in The Netherlands?
Well remember that a language normally 

98
00:05:40,391 --> 00:05:41,224
consists of a number of different 
dialects that are usually united by a 

99
00:05:44,381 --> 00:05:45,214
common standard language.
The standard form of Dutch used in 

100
00:05:47,591 --> 00:05:51,160
Belgium is basically the same as the 
standard form used in the Netherlands,

101
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,730
but the dialects that people grow up 
speaking are different than those spoken

102
00:05:54,731 --> 00:05:57,770
in the Netherlands and the different 
quite a lot from each other as well.

103
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,690
The dialects of Dutch spoken and 
flinders are often collectively referred

104
00:06:02,691 --> 00:06:03,710
to as Flemish.

105
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:07,970
The main dialect groups are in and east,
Flemish and west.

106
00:06:07,971 --> 00:06:10,700
Flemish and Limberg ish are sometimes 
included as well.

107
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:11,683
Though these are often considered 
distinct enough to be separate regional 

108
00:06:14,091 --> 00:06:16,400
languages.
Limburger cheese for example,

109
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:19,640
has some features that are closer to 
German than other Dutch dialect.

110
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:20,773
For example,
personal pronouns that are similar to 

111
00:06:22,251 --> 00:06:26,840
the German ones like myth do this and so
on.

112
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:28,543
Exactly where to draw the boundaries of 
a language and deciding which dialects 

113
00:06:31,761 --> 00:06:34,340
are included in that language is often a
tricky question.

114
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,430
There's no black and white distinction 
between Dutch and German,

115
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:40,400
but rather there's a west Germanic 
dialect continuum.

116
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:41,234
Spending a wide area and language 
features gradually change as you move 

117
00:06:44,451 --> 00:06:45,284
along.
The continuum and the standard language 

118
00:06:47,151 --> 00:06:47,984
that a dialect is paired with often for 
political reasons is a big factor in 

119
00:06:51,441 --> 00:06:54,110
what language or a dialect is considered
to belong to.

120
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,513
Of course the promotion of Standard 
Dutch has caused Flemish dialects to 

121
00:06:58,191 --> 00:06:59,024
fade to some extent,
but some differences in vocabulary and 

122
00:07:01,431 --> 00:07:05,360
pronunciation remain.
There's also a new variety of Dutch that

123
00:07:05,361 --> 00:07:06,194
has arisen called [inaudible].
It's basically a middle ground between 

124
00:07:09,201 --> 00:07:10,034
standard Dutch and Flemish dialects,
but from a lot of comments I've seen 

125
00:07:13,401 --> 00:07:17,030
online that seems like a lot of people 
dislike this variety of Dutch.

126
00:07:17,031 --> 00:07:17,864
They think it sounds artificial.
The situation with French is also 

127
00:07:20,601 --> 00:07:21,434
interesting.
Standard French is learned by everyone 

128
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,224
in the French speaking areas,
but it's paired with traditional 

129
00:07:26,331 --> 00:07:31,331
dialects like walloon or while loan 
peacock Sean Penn won and Loja,

130
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:34,490
which are arguably separate regional 
languages.

131
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:37,550
They belonged to the longer boy in the 
branch of the Gallo.

132
00:07:37,551 --> 00:07:39,800
Romance languages as standard French 
does,

133
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:43,010
but they are distinct from it.
These regional languages have,

134
00:07:43,011 --> 00:07:47,060
for the most part been replaced by 
standard French and are mainly spoken by

135
00:07:47,061 --> 00:07:49,940
an aging population and particularly in 
the countryside.

136
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:53,000
These lung,
the oil in Wallonia have not remained in

137
00:07:53,001 --> 00:07:55,910
use as much as the Flemish dialects and 
flenders have.

138
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:58,760
Why is that?
I think that's partly because during the

139
00:07:58,761 --> 00:08:03,110
period of French rule when the use of 
French was highly encouraged speakers of

140
00:08:03,111 --> 00:08:07,430
closely related regional languages found
it much easier to adapt to French.

141
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,293
Then the speakers of Flemish dialects in
the north did and maybe because those 

142
00:08:11,661 --> 00:08:13,850
languages are so closely related to 
French,

143
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,713
their speakers felt that they were just 
making a small adjustment rather than 

144
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,570
giving up something,
but that's my speculation as is the case

145
00:08:20,571 --> 00:08:21,404
with Dutch and French.
Belgium has a number of dialects that 

146
00:08:23,721 --> 00:08:24,554
are considered to be a part of the 
German language alongside standard 

147
00:08:27,021 --> 00:08:27,854
German.
The German dialects of the officially 

148
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,223
German speaking areas are central German
dialects including Repu area in the 

149
00:08:33,771 --> 00:08:34,604
northern part of the area and Moselle 
Franconia in the southern part of the 

150
00:08:37,581 --> 00:08:38,240
area.

151
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,940
These dialects differ significantly from
standard German,

152
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:41,803
but standard German has had an influence
on them resulting in some dialect 

153
00:08:44,721 --> 00:08:45,554
leveling,
meaning that the dialects are not as 

154
00:08:47,001 --> 00:08:47,834
different from standard German anymore 
and not as different from each other 

155
00:08:50,241 --> 00:08:51,074
anymore and speakers up those dialects 
use some French vocabulary in their 

156
00:08:54,081 --> 00:08:54,914
speech because of the influence of the 
surrounding French speakers in the 

157
00:08:57,361 --> 00:08:58,194
Willow Nia region and I believe the 
majority of German speakers are 

158
00:09:00,721 --> 00:09:01,554
bilingual and can speak French as well 
because Belgium is part of a Germanic 

159
00:09:06,931 --> 00:09:07,764
dialect continuum.
There are a number of dialects that 

160
00:09:09,781 --> 00:09:12,750
don't clearly fall under any of the 
three official languages.

161
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,733
One such language as low deach,
which is a number of transitional 

162
00:09:16,231 --> 00:09:17,064
dialects between Lindbergh Ish,
which is often considered a flemish 

163
00:09:19,531 --> 00:09:22,260
dialect and the rip you Arion dialect of
German.

164
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:23,303
It's spoken in a few towns and villages 
in the municipality of open in the 

165
00:09:26,461 --> 00:09:27,294
German speaking part of the edge,
but rather than simply being considered 

166
00:09:30,031 --> 00:09:30,864
a dialect of German,
it's unique enough to be considered its 

167
00:09:33,001 --> 00:09:34,110
own regional language.

168
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,753
Certain varieties of low ditch are very 
close to certain varieties of Limburg 

169
00:09:38,941 --> 00:09:39,774
ish,
which is sometimes considered a flemish 

170
00:09:40,951 --> 00:09:42,450
dialects,
a Dutch dialect,

171
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:43,463
but other varieties of low deach are 
very close to certain varieties of 

172
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:50,820
riparian which are considered varieties 
of German classifying these very similar

173
00:09:50,821 --> 00:09:51,654
dialects as different languages is one 
of those confusing and mystifying 

174
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:57,930
aspects of linguistics.
Then there's Luxembourg ish.

175
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,420
It's spoken in the Belgian province of 
Luxembourg,

176
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:02,610
which has the same name as the 
neighboring country.

177
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:05,580
Even though it's closely related to the 
surrounding Moselle,

178
00:10:05,581 --> 00:10:06,414
Franconia and German dialects.
It's not normally considered a dialect 

179
00:10:09,361 --> 00:10:10,194
of German.
That's partly because it has its own 

180
00:10:11,461 --> 00:10:12,294
standardized written form and it 
speakers are not considered members of 

181
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:18,510
the German speaking community but rather
speakers of a regional language.

182
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,493
The area in which Luxembourg she has 
spoken is inside French speaking 

183
00:10:22,171 --> 00:10:25,680
Wallonia where Luxembourg ish is 
recognized as a regional language,

184
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,920
but the use of Luxembourg ishe has 
declined in favor of French.

185
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:32,123
Much of what I say in this section will 
be based on comments that I've read 

186
00:10:34,321 --> 00:10:35,154
online written by a Belgian people and 
comments I've heard from Belgian people 

187
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:39,054
face to face.
As you can see from the statistics we 

188
00:10:40,831 --> 00:10:41,664
looked at earlier,
most Belgians can speak at least two of 

189
00:10:43,681 --> 00:10:44,514
the official languages at least to some 
extent in particular Dutch speakers can 

190
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:48,714
usually speak some French,
but according to a lot of comments that 

191
00:10:50,971 --> 00:10:53,760
I've read that some Dutch speakers are 
reluctant to speak French,

192
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,713
especially in a Dutch speaking area.
It's quite common in bilingual places 

193
00:10:57,811 --> 00:10:58,644
for speakers of one language to resent 
having to speak the other language if 

194
00:11:01,771 --> 00:11:04,950
they feel that their own language isn't 
being given equal status.

195
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:05,873
French has traditionally been the higher
status language in Belgium and Dutch 

196
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:09,624
speakers had to learn it in order to 
advance in life for it to get a better 

197
00:11:12,811 --> 00:11:14,040
job than that kind of thing.

198
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,083
So maybe because of this sort of 
historical rivalry there might be some 

199
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:18,624
resistance to speaking French.
That's just my impression based on 

200
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:23,670
things I've heard or read and I can't 
exactly say for certain,

201
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,633
and these days,
English is becoming much more widely 

202
00:11:28,081 --> 00:11:31,260
used as a second language in flanders.
While French has declined,

203
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,273
some young people who speak mostly Dutch
and flanders might speak English when 

204
00:11:35,101 --> 00:11:35,934
they encounter a French speaker or when 
they visit the bilingual city of 

205
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:39,114
Brussels.
Education in Belgium is different 

206
00:11:40,621 --> 00:11:43,920
depending on the linguistic community 
that administers that area.

207
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:44,843
In Flanders,
students begin learning French in the 

208
00:11:46,351 --> 00:11:47,184
fifth grade of elementary school and 
then begin learning English in seventh 

209
00:11:49,951 --> 00:11:52,140
grade,
and some students take German or another

210
00:11:52,141 --> 00:11:52,974
language later,
but there are students who complained 

211
00:11:54,491 --> 00:11:55,324
that the teaching methods emphasize 
grammar and literacy rather than 

212
00:11:57,731 --> 00:11:58,564
communication,
which leaves them without enough 

213
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,570
conversational confidence.

214
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:06,250
Wallonia some French speakers are also 
bilingual French Dutch speakers,

215
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:09,040
but not as many of them.
But in recent decades,

216
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:09,903
more French speakers are learning Dutch 
because of the growing economic 

217
00:12:12,341 --> 00:12:16,060
influence of Flanders.
The education system in Velonia offers a

218
00:12:16,061 --> 00:12:18,850
choice between Dutch and English.
Many choose Dutch,

219
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,713
but again,
they don't necessarily learn to 

220
00:12:20,681 --> 00:12:24,280
communicate that well in the language.
A smaller but significant number,

221
00:12:24,281 --> 00:12:26,620
learn German,
but outside of the border areas.

222
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:28,450
Few of them learn it to an advanced 
level.

223
00:12:28,451 --> 00:12:32,050
From what I hear and as in Flanders,
English is growing in popularity.

224
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:33,303
Brussels,
even though it's an enclave inside 

225
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,004
Flanders,
Brussels is officially bilingual and 

226
00:12:38,321 --> 00:12:39,154
wild.
There are no official counts of who 

227
00:12:40,001 --> 00:12:40,834
speaks with language.
It's an overwhelmingly French speaking 

228
00:12:43,061 --> 00:12:46,580
city with many estimates saying it's 
over 90% francophone.

229
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,673
Both French and Dutch schools are 
available and each family can choose 

230
00:12:50,411 --> 00:12:51,244
which type of school to send their 
children to regardless of what language 

231
00:12:53,651 --> 00:12:56,050
they speak at home and at shops and 
restaurants.

232
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,390
Staff should be able to speak both 
languages,

233
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:02,260
at least in theory,
but that's a major capital and as the de

234
00:13:02,261 --> 00:13:03,094
facto capital of the European Union.
Brussels is a very international and 

235
00:13:06,461 --> 00:13:07,294
linguistically diverse place.
Many languages are spoken among the 

236
00:13:09,881 --> 00:13:14,140
expat communities with English serving 
as a Lingua Franca alongside French.

237
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:15,243
There are also many immigrants.
In 2010 about 18% of the population of 

238
00:13:19,241 --> 00:13:20,074
Belgium was foreign born.
While in Brussels the number was around 

239
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:23,374
33% many of these people and their 
children are native speakers of 

240
00:13:26,261 --> 00:13:28,330
languages other than Dutch,
French and German.

241
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,253
From what I understand,
many of these people speak a foreign 

242
00:13:31,091 --> 00:13:33,910
language at home,
one of Belgium's official languages,

243
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,450
probably Dutch or French and in many 
cases English as well.

244
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:39,483
The German speaking community because of
their proximity to French speaking 

245
00:13:42,491 --> 00:13:45,730
Wallonia and because French is a 
required subject in schools,

246
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:50,290
in the German speaking community areas,
most German speakers can speak French as

247
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:52,360
well as German and from what I 
understand,

248
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,223
many speak Dutch as well,
which is probably helped by the fact 

249
00:13:55,661 --> 00:14:00,040
that Dutch and German are closely 
related media in Belgium.

250
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:00,903
The media in each linguistic area is 
dominated by the language of that 

251
00:14:03,671 --> 00:14:05,980
region.
Each of the three linguistic communities

252
00:14:05,981 --> 00:14:08,470
has its own public broadcasting 
organization,

253
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,333
which is responsible for creating 
content and administering radio and TV 

254
00:14:12,821 --> 00:14:13,654
stations and so on.
The result is that the members of each 

255
00:14:15,671 --> 00:14:16,504
linguistic community are primarily 
exposed to only their own language 

256
00:14:19,271 --> 00:14:21,880
through the media.
The notable exception is Brussels,

257
00:14:21,881 --> 00:14:24,910
where both the Flemish community and the
French speaking communities,

258
00:14:24,911 --> 00:14:25,744
public broadcasting organizations 
operate Belgium as an interesting case 

259
00:14:30,821 --> 00:14:35,050
because in some ways it operates like 
three separate countries administered by

260
00:14:35,051 --> 00:14:38,110
three different linguistic communities 
with their own governments.

261
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,033
And the generally limited interaction 
between flanders and Maloney up 

262
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:44,650
reinforces the kind of linguistic divide
or separation.

263
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:45,693
But the majority of people speak two 
official languages at least to some 

264
00:14:48,251 --> 00:14:49,084
extent,
and some of them speak three with a lot 

265
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:54,500
of people learning English these days as
in many multilingual federations.

266
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,393
Some people speculate about whether the 
country will fracture into separate 

267
00:14:58,101 --> 00:14:58,934
countries and there are disagreements 
about how to handle the complex 

268
00:15:01,641 --> 00:15:05,360
governing of a federation with three 
regional governments and three community

269
00:15:05,361 --> 00:15:08,510
governments based on language in 
addition to a federal government.

270
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,553
I can't claim to speak for Belgians,
but just from the comments that I've 

271
00:15:11,961 --> 00:15:12,794
read and heard,
it seems to me that Belgian people 

272
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:19,070
identify more as Flemish or walloon or 
as German speaking then as Belgium,

273
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:20,203
but they generally have no strong 
objection to this federal system from 

274
00:15:22,761 --> 00:15:23,594
what I can see.
But this kind of situation reminds us 

275
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:28,220
that languages are not just systems of 
communication.

276
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,380
They are also part of people's 
identities.

277
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,273
End of tremendous importance to people.
The question of the day for people from 

278
00:15:34,281 --> 00:15:35,114
Belgium,
what's your native language and to what 

279
00:15:36,621 --> 00:15:40,100
extent do you speak to the other 
official languages and for other people?

280
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:40,963
Let me ask a more general question.
To what extent do you see your native 

281
00:15:43,941 --> 00:15:44,774
language as part of your identity?
For me as an English speaker from 

282
00:15:47,271 --> 00:15:48,104
Canada,
my language is not really a strong part 

283
00:15:49,701 --> 00:15:52,130
of my identity.
It just feels like the default,

284
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:54,920
but I know it's different for a lot of 
people around the world.

285
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:56,960
How about you?
Be sure to follow Lang,

286
00:15:56,961 --> 00:15:58,610
focus on facebook,
twitter,

287
00:15:58,611 --> 00:16:00,320
and Instagram,
and once again,

288
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:02,690
thank you to my amazing patrion 
supporters,

289
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:05,030
especially these ones right here on the 
screen.

290
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:09,110
Who are my top tier patrion supporters?
Thank you for watching and have.
