Uh,

3
00:00:04,631 --> 00:00:05,920
what should we do today?
Today?

4
00:00:05,921 --> 00:00:07,870
Let's talk about Chinese.
No,

5
00:00:07,871 --> 00:00:09,610
let's talk about written Chinese.
No,

6
00:00:09,611 --> 00:00:12,940
let's talk about classical Chinese or 
maybe standard Chinese.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,301
No,
no.

8
00:00:13,301 --> 00:00:15,730
We're going to talk about various 
Chinese dialects.

9
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:17,530
Okay.
Let's just talk about all of them.

10
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,153
Hello everyone.
Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and 

11
00:00:25,931 --> 00:00:29,530
my name is Paul.
Today we're going to talk about Chinese,

12
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:32,740
but the big question is what do I mean 
when I say Chinese?

13
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,530
The word Chinese refers to standard 
Chinese,

14
00:00:35,531 --> 00:00:36,364
which is based on Mandarin,
but it also refers to a large group of 

15
00:00:38,921 --> 00:00:42,610
languages and dialects spoken throughout
China and indeed throughout the world.

16
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:47,700
Chinese languages also called synetic 
languages or a sub family of the silo.

17
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:51,040
Tibetan language family.
Chinese is not a single language,

18
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:51,874
but rather a number of related dialect 
groups which are united by a common 

19
00:00:55,151 --> 00:00:57,310
written language,
a common writing system.

20
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:00,070
Some people consider them all Chinese 
dialects,

21
00:01:00,071 --> 00:01:00,904
but I'm going to refer to these dialect 
groups as distinct languages because in 

22
00:01:03,941 --> 00:01:04,774
many cases they are unintelligible.
All Chinese languages are tonal 

23
00:01:07,931 --> 00:01:08,764
languages.
The meaning of a word depends on the 

24
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:13,290
tone or the tones that you say it with.
Sure.

25
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:17,170
She Shit,
if you change the tone,

26
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,530
the meaning of the word changes,
there were more than 1.3

27
00:01:20,531 --> 00:01:24,220
billion native speakers of Chinese.
If we include all its varieties.

28
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:25,413
Standard Chinese generally referred to 
as Mandarin is the official language of 

29
00:01:28,961 --> 00:01:31,750
the People's Republic of China,
the Republic of China,

30
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:35,230
also known as Taiwan or Chinese.
Taipei.

31
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:37,640
Okay.

32
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,520
And it's one of the four official 
languages of Singapore.

33
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:41,533
Chinese languages are also spoken in 
lots of diaspora communities throughout 

34
00:01:44,721 --> 00:01:46,220
Asia,
like in Malaysia,

35
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,610
Indonesia and Thailand and in different 
communities around the world.

36
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:51,123
History,
the sign nick languages or the Chinese 

37
00:01:53,351 --> 00:01:56,350
languages developed from Prodo Sino 
Tibetan,

38
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:59,470
which existed perhaps around 4,000
bce.

39
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:04,870
The earliest written examples of Chinese
are from around 1250 bce.

40
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:09,190
They were written using a form of 
Chinese called the oracle bone script,

41
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,950
which was carved onto turtle shells and 
animal bones,

42
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:14,980
which were used for divination,
like a kind of fortune telling,

43
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:16,083
a more recognizable form of old Chinese 
developed during the Jo Dynasty between 

44
00:02:19,691 --> 00:02:22,210
10:46
AM two 56 bce.

45
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,990
It can be found on bronze sculptures 
from that time period as well as in some

46
00:02:25,991 --> 00:02:26,824
literature like a classic of poetry.
It's generally thought that during this 

47
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,890
early time period Chinese had not yet 
developed tones.

48
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:35,830
Those develops later in the transition 
to middle Chinese,

49
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:36,723
the form of written Chinese that 
developed between this period and the 

50
00:02:39,491 --> 00:02:41,770
end of the Han Dynasty in the third 
century.

51
00:02:41,771 --> 00:02:45,730
Ce is known as classical Chinese or 
literary Chinese.

52
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:51,340
Classical Chinese continued to be used 
as the formal written language until the

53
00:02:51,341 --> 00:02:52,174
beginning of the 20th century spoken.
Chinese continued to evolve into middle 

54
00:02:55,691 --> 00:03:00,691
Chinese.
Middle Chinese is ancestor of almost all

55
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:04,390
modern Chinese varieties.
The exception is Min Chinese,

56
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:07,120
which developed earlier maybe during the
Han period.

57
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,570
Middle Chinese was not a single unified 
language,

58
00:03:10,571 --> 00:03:11,404
but consisted of a number of mutually 
intelligible dialects that began 

59
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:17,710
diverging in different directions around
the 10th century Ce,

60
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:18,843
and you'll probably hear me say that 
every time I talk about a language 

61
00:03:20,771 --> 00:03:21,604
family,
those local varieties of Chinese 

62
00:03:22,991 --> 00:03:23,824
continued to develop in their own 
directions as distinct languages over 

63
00:03:26,621 --> 00:03:27,454
the centuries with a lot of local 
dialectal variation within each 

64
00:03:30,431 --> 00:03:32,320
language.
As I mentioned before,

65
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:35,680
classical Chinese was being used as the 
formal written language,

66
00:03:35,681 --> 00:03:38,230
but during this time period written 
vernacular,

67
00:03:38,231 --> 00:03:39,064
Chinese also developed alongside it,
written for an ocular Chinese refers to 

68
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:43,563
ways of writing Chinese that reflect the
spoken language in its different 

69
00:03:46,331 --> 00:03:47,164
varieties.

70
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:50,320
These forms of Chinese were used for 
some informal writing.

71
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:52,660
People were already writing and written 
vernacular,

72
00:03:52,661 --> 00:03:53,494
Chinese during the tongue and some 
dynasties from the seventh to 13th 

73
00:03:56,951 --> 00:03:58,900
century CE,
old Mandarin.

74
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:04,660
After the Northern Song Dynasty and 
during the gene and you end dynasties,

75
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,900
a language recognizable as a form of 
mentoring was spoken.

76
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,780
This variety of Chinese is known as Old 
Mandarin.

77
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:14,560
The UN dynasty was a period of Mongol 
control of China.

78
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:18,940
The world's leading up to the Mongol 
conquest caused large scale migration of

79
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:19,803
old mandarin speakers to the south.
This spread early mandarin dialects to 

80
00:04:22,931 --> 00:04:27,100
more areas and also had an influence on 
other emerging Chinese languages.

81
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,143
Middle Mandarin during the Ming and 
Ching dynasties and official 

82
00:04:31,091 --> 00:04:31,924
administrative language was created 
based on the mandarin dialect of the 

83
00:04:34,901 --> 00:04:38,380
capitol non Jean with some features of 
other dialects as well.

84
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:42,070
This was the first point at which the 
language became referred to as Mandarin,

85
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,430
which means speech of officials.

86
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,473
We now refer to the stage of the 
language as middle mandarin in the late 

87
00:04:50,711 --> 00:04:53,590
19th century towards the end of the 
Ching Dynasty.

88
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:57,970
The specific dialect of Beijing started 
to grow in importance and became the new

89
00:04:57,971 --> 00:04:58,804
high variety of Chinese replacing the 
older high variety which was based on a 

90
00:05:02,441 --> 00:05:06,040
number of different dialects at the 
beginning of the 20th century,

91
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:06,963
a form of written vernacular,
Chinese based on a number of mandarin 

92
00:05:09,701 --> 00:05:10,534
dialects was introduced as the new 
official written language instead of 

93
00:05:13,841 --> 00:05:14,674
classical Chinese,
but it was later decided that the new 

94
00:05:16,781 --> 00:05:20,440
official language should be based 
specifically on the Beijing dialect.

95
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:21,303
This new standard language was called,
which means common language or which 

96
00:05:27,191 --> 00:05:28,024
means national language.
People often refer to this standard 

97
00:05:30,491 --> 00:05:34,510
language as mandarin because it's based 
on the mandarin dialect of Beijing.

98
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,553
But to be precise,
the word mandarin refers to a range of 

99
00:05:37,991 --> 00:05:39,130
northern dialect.

100
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,360
Standard Chinese or Mandarin now 
fulfills the role that classical Chinese

101
00:05:43,361 --> 00:05:44,194
used to fulfill as the official written 
language that's used by speakers of all 

102
00:05:47,471 --> 00:05:48,304
varieties of Chinese for most purposes,
but written vernacular languages still 

103
00:05:52,121 --> 00:05:55,030
do exist and are used for some informal 
situations.

104
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:57,350
So how many varieties of Chinese are 
there?

105
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:58,243
Well,
that depends on how you're counting and 

106
00:05:59,181 --> 00:06:00,014
categorizing them,
but it's often said that there are over 

107
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:02,594
200 distinct varieties of Chinese,
which comprise around 13 distinct 

108
00:06:06,471 --> 00:06:07,304
dialect can groups the local dialects 
within each of these groups are often 

109
00:06:10,701 --> 00:06:11,534
intelligible.
So it's reasonable to consider these 

110
00:06:13,281 --> 00:06:17,690
groups as languages at least I think so.
Out of these 13 groups of dialects,

111
00:06:17,691 --> 00:06:20,390
there are seven that are generally 
considered a major.

112
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:25,660
These are mandarin UAA Shung men by done
gone.

113
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,113
You

114
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:33,050
and hot got,
Huh?

115
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:38,230
The writing system,
Chinese is written in Chinese characters

116
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:43,150
or Hudson Han.
Soo are logograms single characters that

117
00:06:43,151 --> 00:06:46,300
represent entire words or entire units 
of meaning.

118
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,370
For example,
this character means China.

119
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:49,263
In this character means character as in 
a written character and together they 

120
00:06:52,511 --> 00:06:56,530
mean Chinese character or Han Zu,
the kind we're talking about.

121
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:57,543
These characters need to be learned one 
by one because just knowing the 

122
00:07:00,251 --> 00:07:04,000
pronunciation of a word doesn't give you
any indication of how to write it.

123
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:04,863
Speakers of all varieties of Chinese 
typically right in standard Chinese or 

124
00:07:08,081 --> 00:07:08,914
mandarin,
even though their spoken language is 

125
00:07:10,271 --> 00:07:13,100
different when the reading standard 
Chinese out loud,

126
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:13,973
they'll probably pronounce each 
character the way it's pronounced in 

127
00:07:16,301 --> 00:07:20,170
their local variety of Chinese.
This has led to the common misconception

128
00:07:20,171 --> 00:07:24,190
that all Chinese languages are exactly 
the same except for their pronunciation.

129
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:28,990
The fact is Chinese languages often 
differ in grammar and vocabulary as well

130
00:07:28,991 --> 00:07:29,980
as pronunciation.

131
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,143
The various forms of written vernacular,
Chinese that developed alongside 

132
00:07:34,061 --> 00:07:37,510
classical Chinese still exist today 
alongside standard Chinese.

133
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,880
They're only used in some limited 
situations,

134
00:07:39,881 --> 00:07:40,714
but Cantonese in particular is fairly 
widely used from what I understand most 

135
00:07:44,621 --> 00:07:45,454
of the characters used are the same,
but there'll be pronounced differently 

136
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:48,723
and some different characters might be 
used to represent the different 

137
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:51,874
vocabulary and the order of the 
characters might be different to 

138
00:07:54,281 --> 00:07:57,010
represent the different syntax.
Pronunciation,

139
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:00,250
as previously mentioned,
Chinese languages are tonal.

140
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,113
That means that tones are one part of 
the pronunciation that can change the 

141
00:08:04,121 --> 00:08:04,954
meaning of a word.
The same written word can be pronounced 

142
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:09,550
very differently in different Chinese 
languages.

143
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,640
This is the word for telephone first in 
Mandarin,

144
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:18,370
next in Cantonese in Wa,
in Shanghainese,

145
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:24,190
and then Haka.
Let me explain a little further.

146
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:28,060
Mandarin has four main tones plus one 
neutral tone.

147
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:33,100
The tones are number one,
a high flat tone to arising tone,

148
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,570
three uh,
falling.

149
00:08:34,571 --> 00:08:37,930
Rising tone for uh,
falling tone and five,

150
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:38,823
the neutral tone,
meaning that syllable is not 

151
00:08:40,271 --> 00:08:41,650
distinguished by tone at all.

152
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,360
Ma Ma,
Ma,

153
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,590
Ma,
ma.

154
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,190
Now Cantonese has six tones.
The six cantor.

155
00:08:49,191 --> 00:08:50,024
These tones are number one,
a high flat tone to amid rising tome 

156
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:58,200
three amid flat tone for a low falling 
tone.

157
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:02,550
Five a low rising tone and six a low 
flat tone.

158
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:04,760
Si,
Si,

159
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,710
Si,
Si,

160
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:08,850
Si,
Si.

161
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:13,170
Shanghainese has a different type of 
tone system entirely.

162
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:16,020
It's more of a pitch accent system like 
Japanese.

163
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,080
There were really only two tones high 
and low.

164
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,183
At the tone of the first syllable 
determines the tone pattern of the 

165
00:09:22,411 --> 00:09:25,440
following syllables.
The you hear,

166
00:09:25,441 --> 00:09:26,274
the first syllable has a low tone,
which depends on the character that 

167
00:09:29,281 --> 00:09:32,970
makes the second syllable high and it 
doesn't matter what character it is.

168
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:37,740
Tone is only connected to meaning in the
first syllable word order.

169
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:41,100
There are both similarities and 
differences in the word order of Chinese

170
00:09:41,101 --> 00:09:41,934
languages.
Mandarin is generally svo though it's 

171
00:09:44,521 --> 00:09:45,354
Sov and some structures and Cantonese is
also Svo more so than member 

172
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:53,580
Shanghainese and other Wu dialects are 
both Svo and Sov.

173
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,940
So in Mandarin we have who?
Courtroom,

174
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,150
which means I drink juice.
Here's the subject,

175
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:03,210
verb and object.
And in Cantonese,

176
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,730
all young goal,
it's up again,

177
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,593
subject,
verb,

178
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,433
object.

179
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,470
And now in Shanghainese.
Ooh,

180
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,313
took in these examples,
it turns out that the word orders the 

181
00:10:13,111 --> 00:10:13,944
same,
but notice that each language uses a 

182
00:10:15,391 --> 00:10:18,480
different character for the verb to 
reflect different vocabulary.

183
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:23,160
Let's look at another element of word 
order mandarin places an indirect object

184
00:10:23,161 --> 00:10:23,994
before the direct object.
Cantonese places at after the direct 

185
00:10:26,761 --> 00:10:27,594
object like in this sentence,
which means give me the book in 

186
00:10:30,511 --> 00:10:32,310
Mandarin,
Gay Weapons.

187
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:33,983
So we're forward.
It's give me book and in Cantonese bape 

188
00:10:37,281 --> 00:10:41,160
and the single word for word,
it's give book me and a few.

189
00:10:41,161 --> 00:10:44,100
Imagine a two in there.
It's like give book to me.

190
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:45,263
Also noticed the character for give is 
different here and in Shanghainese oh 

191
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,650
bones hear the word order is like 
mandarin,

192
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:56,970
but notice the different word for give 
and the variant character for me.

193
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:01,680
Another example of difference mandarin 
or standard Chinese places.

194
00:11:01,681 --> 00:11:03,180
The adverb before the verb.

195
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:06,360
This sentence means I'll go first in 
member in it,

196
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,670
boy,
since all word for word,

197
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:11,700
it's I first go,
but Cantonese places,

198
00:11:11,701 --> 00:11:15,330
the adverb after the verb,
all it's llc work forward.

199
00:11:15,331 --> 00:11:20,331
It's I go first and in Shanghainese 
we'll see about tele here.

200
00:11:20,641 --> 00:11:21,474
The main word order is the same as 
mandarin with the advert before the 

201
00:11:24,091 --> 00:11:24,924
verb,
but notice the additional particles at 

202
00:11:26,491 --> 00:11:29,730
the end which are four exclamation but 
don't have any core meaning.

203
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:32,850
Another example difference mandarin 
places,

204
00:11:32,851 --> 00:11:33,684
the adjective after the noun,
so the phrase meaning strong wind in 

205
00:11:36,961 --> 00:11:37,794
Mandarin.
It's literally when the strong from how 

206
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,560
Cantonese places the adjective before 
the noun,

207
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,513
so literally it's strong wind hold 
iphone and in Shanghainese Fun loud to 

208
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:53,290
hear the adjective comes after the now 
just like in Mandarin,

209
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:56,140
but notice that one of the two 
characters is different.

210
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:57,843
Those are just a few samples of the 
variation between the different Chinese 

211
00:12:00,581 --> 00:12:01,414
languages and their dialects.
We could go very deeply into these 

212
00:12:03,701 --> 00:12:04,534
differences,
but that's beyond the scope of this 

213
00:12:06,011 --> 00:12:06,970
general video.

214
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:09,883
One other difference we should talk 
about though is that there are two 

215
00:12:11,721 --> 00:12:14,240
different systems for writing Chinese 
characters.

216
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,193
There are traditional characters,
the ones that are written as they 

217
00:12:17,301 --> 00:12:18,134
weren't in classical Chinese and then 
there are simplified characters which 

218
00:12:21,051 --> 00:12:24,770
were created in the 1950s and sixties to
increase literacy.

219
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:25,723
Simplified characters are used in the 
People's Republic of China and in 

220
00:12:28,431 --> 00:12:29,264
Singapore.
Traditional characters are used in 

221
00:12:30,861 --> 00:12:34,880
Taiwan and in Hong Kong and Macau which 
were not under Chinese rule.

222
00:12:34,881 --> 00:12:36,890
When simplified characters were 
introduced.

223
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,980
There are also used in many Chinese 
diaspora communities.

224
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:43,530
Here's the traditional character on the 
left and here's that.

225
00:12:43,531 --> 00:12:44,364
Simplify the equivalent on the right so 
you can see that they are different and 

226
00:12:47,211 --> 00:12:49,610
it's probably easier to write the 
simplified loan,

227
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,713
but despite the differences,
literate native speakers generally have 

228
00:12:53,241 --> 00:12:55,460
no trouble reading either type of 
character.

229
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:58,040
As you can see,
the scientific language family,

230
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:58,903
which is often called Chinese,
is a large diverse group of languages 

231
00:13:01,701 --> 00:13:04,130
and dialects which are often 
unintelligible.

232
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,173
What unites them all together is there 
shared origin and growing out of middle 

233
00:13:08,391 --> 00:13:11,150
Chinese and the classical Chinese 
literary tradition,

234
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:12,103
and there are also united by a common 
written language which is learned and 

235
00:13:15,021 --> 00:13:17,810
understood by speakers of all Chinese 
varieties.

236
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:18,973
However,
even though speakers of different 

237
00:13:19,971 --> 00:13:23,360
Chinese languages can easily communicate
with each other in writing,

238
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:24,343
that shared writing system isn't enough 
to help them communicate verbally 

239
00:13:27,411 --> 00:13:28,244
without specifically learning Mandarin.
This is a good reason to consider 

240
00:13:30,951 --> 00:13:31,784
Chinese a group of languages or a 
language family rather than a single 

241
00:13:34,761 --> 00:13:35,594
language with many dialects.
Solve the question of the day to native 

242
00:13:38,121 --> 00:13:42,200
speakers of any variety of Chinese.
Do you consider Chinese to be a group of

243
00:13:42,201 --> 00:13:43,034
distinct languages or do you consider it
one language with a lot of dialectal 

244
00:13:46,401 --> 00:13:47,234
variation?
And I'm just asking you to explain the 

245
00:13:48,921 --> 00:13:49,754
way that you personally think about it.
So there's no right or wrong answer 

246
00:13:52,221 --> 00:13:53,054
here.
And for people who have studied any 

247
00:13:54,381 --> 00:13:57,350
variety of Chinese,
just tell us something that you've found

248
00:13:57,351 --> 00:13:59,780
fascinating about your journey with that
language.

249
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:02,090
Be sure to follow Lang,
focus on facebook,

250
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,200
twitter,
and instagram.

251
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:04,063
And once again,
I'd like to say thank you to all of my 

252
00:14:05,721 --> 00:14:06,554
fantastic patrion supporters,
especially these amazing people right 

253
00:14:09,471 --> 00:14:12,710
here on the screen.
Thank you for watching and have a nice.
