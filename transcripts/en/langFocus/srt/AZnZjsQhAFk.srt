Hello everyone.
Thank you for tuning into laying focus 

2
00:00:04,291 --> 00:00:05,124
TV.
I am your host Paul and today we're 

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:10,650
going to talk about the difference 
between informal and formal language and

4
00:00:10,651 --> 00:00:14,040
which one you should focus on learning 
when you're learning a new language.

5
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,410
We have two special guests with us 
today.

6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,210
They both happened to be cousins of 
mine.

7
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:21,630
One is my cousin Fred and the other is 
my cousin Ivan.

8
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:23,340
So welcome to both of you.
Yo,

9
00:00:23,341 --> 00:00:24,750
what's up?
Okay,

10
00:00:24,751 --> 00:00:25,584
so let's start off by talking about some
of the differences between formal 

11
00:00:28,021 --> 00:00:28,854
language and informal language and later
on we'll get into which one you should 

12
00:00:32,131 --> 00:00:34,170
focus on learning when you learn a new 
language.

13
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,540
So far more frank,
I'd like to start with you.

14
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,553
Would you tell us a little bit about 
formal language and how it differs from 

15
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:41,243
informal language?
Formal speech usually mirrors the 

16
00:00:43,801 --> 00:00:46,380
written language,
so when people are speaking formally,

17
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,140
they are speaking with the written 
language in mind.

18
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,033
They might be seeing the sentences 
inside their head as they are saying 

19
00:00:52,561 --> 00:00:54,720
them.
They are keeping grammar and mind.

20
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:55,583
They're conscious of grammar and they're
constructing those sentences carefully 

21
00:00:58,111 --> 00:01:00,930
to follow the rules of grammar that they
learned in school.

22
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,590
And they might be using some vocabulary 
that they see written in books,

23
00:01:04,591 --> 00:01:07,050
but they don't usually use in casual 
conversation.

24
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:10,980
And maybe the most important thing,
the most important differences that they

25
00:01:10,981 --> 00:01:13,620
are enunciating all of the words very 
clearly.

26
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:14,843
So the people who find the formal 
language quite easy to learn are people 

27
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:21,090
who are visual learners and people who 
are kind of analytical.

28
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,780
So that gets them thinking about the 
different pieces of the sentence and how

29
00:01:24,781 --> 00:01:25,614
to put them together.
Those kinds of people learn the formal 

30
00:01:27,931 --> 00:01:28,764
language quite easily,
and they're typically tend to be quite 

31
00:01:30,901 --> 00:01:33,150
introverted.
So I'm this type of person,

32
00:01:33,151 --> 00:01:34,110
I'm this type of learner.

33
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:36,690
I find it quite easy to learn the formal
language,

34
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,553
well,
relatively easy to learn the formal 

35
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:39,564
language.
I find it easier to learn how to 

36
00:01:40,891 --> 00:01:41,724
understand news broadcasts in a new 
language than I do to understand casual 

37
00:01:45,451 --> 00:01:46,284
conversations on the street.
That's the type of learner I am 

38
00:01:48,481 --> 00:01:49,314
naturally,
just because of my personality and my 

39
00:01:51,181 --> 00:01:53,130
learning style.
I'm a visual learner.

40
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:55,470
I'm introverted and I'm quite 
analytical.

41
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:57,870
Hmm.
That's all very interesting.

42
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,150
So let's hear from informal.
Ivan,

43
00:02:00,151 --> 00:02:00,984
can you tell us a little bit about 
informal language and how that's 

44
00:02:03,001 --> 00:02:03,834
different from the formal language that 
frank described and the people who 

45
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,940
learned a formal language really easily.
