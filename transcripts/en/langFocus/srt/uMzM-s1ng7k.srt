00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:09,863
Hello everyone.
Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and 

4
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:12,444
my name is Paul.
Today we'll be answering the question 

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:15,653
how similar our Spanish and Italian,
Spanish and Italian are both members of 

6
00:00:19,381 --> 00:00:20,214
the romance language family,
which developed from dialects of vulgar 

7
00:00:22,831 --> 00:00:23,664
Latin,
which were spoken throughout the Roman 

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,153
Empire.
For more information on their history 

9
00:00:27,151 --> 00:00:27,984
and development,
check out my video on the romance 

10
00:00:29,491 --> 00:00:33,330
language family right here,
like any pair of romance languages.

11
00:00:33,331 --> 00:00:34,164
Spanish and Italian have a lot in common
and they are mutually intelligible to 

12
00:00:37,171 --> 00:00:38,004
some extent,
especially in the written form and when 

13
00:00:40,171 --> 00:00:41,004
spoken slowly and clearly some speakers 
of Spanish and Italian report that they 

14
00:00:44,551 --> 00:00:45,384
are able to have extended conversations 
with speakers of the other language 

15
00:00:48,511 --> 00:00:49,344
provided that they both speak slowly and
clearly and they stopped to clarify 

16
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,410
unfamiliar vocabulary,
but despite their similarity,

17
00:00:55,411 --> 00:00:58,080
Spanish and Italian are also different 
in many ways.

18
00:00:58,170 --> 00:00:59,003
Let's examine both of the languages 
together and we'll see just what's 

19
00:01:01,321 --> 00:01:02,760
similar and different above them.

20
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:03,863
Vocabulary,
Spanish and Italian have about 82 

21
00:01:06,151 --> 00:01:06,984
percent lexical similarity.
That means that 82 percent of the words 

22
00:01:10,051 --> 00:01:13,710
in either language will have cognate 
vocabulary in the other language.

23
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:18,000
Let's look at some examples of Spanish 
and Italian cognates in Italian,

24
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:18,923
Jada,
dino,

25
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:24,340
and in Spanish.
How these means garden in Italian postal

26
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:26,370
and in Spanish.
Wisdom.

27
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,750
This means place in Italian fjord and in
Spanish,

28
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:33,690
Florida.
This means flower in Italian,

29
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:34,913
bobby Lee,
and in Spanish probably this means 

30
00:01:37,591 --> 00:01:42,120
probable or likely in Italian and it's 
Spanish.

31
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,680
What this means port,
those pairs of words are quite obvious.

32
00:01:46,681 --> 00:01:47,514
Cognates.
Let's look at a couple of less obvious 

33
00:01:49,201 --> 00:01:51,380
cognates as well.
In Italian feeding,

34
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:54,540
you in Spanish,
equal in Italian,

35
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:59,820
he avi in Spanish or in Italian?
Up ended Spanish.

36
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,163
Gotcha.
Now let's look at a couple of sentences 

37
00:02:03,691 --> 00:02:05,520
to see how many of the words are 
similar.

38
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,840
First in Spanish is still agenda and an 
Italian stone agenda on porn.

39
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:14,430
Liberal.
This means I'm reading a good book,

40
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:15,503
so when these two sentences,
all of the vocabulary is equivalent or 

41
00:02:17,941 --> 00:02:20,640
cognate.
Another example in Spanish,

42
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:25,810
and she took him yet in Italian ob zone,
you'll notice all these sentences mean I

43
00:02:28,111 --> 00:02:28,944
need to change a little money.
The way to express need is different 

44
00:02:31,591 --> 00:02:32,424
than the two sentences in Spanish,
yet necessito and in Italian it's ob 

45
00:02:36,331 --> 00:02:37,770
zone.
Your d in Spanish,

46
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,230
the way to say a little is wouldn't 
buckle.

47
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,820
In Italian,
it's wouldn't pull.

48
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,130
In Italian,
you can also say wouldn't buckle,

49
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,580
which is correct,
but it's more common to say,

50
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:51,600
wouldn't pull next the preposition like 
have his day in Spanish and it's deep.

51
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:52,523
In Italian,
the word for money is in Spanish and 

52
00:02:55,321 --> 00:02:59,140
it's solid in Italian.
So in this case you can see that some of

53
00:02:59,141 --> 00:03:01,390
the vocabulary is the same or 
equivalent,

54
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,350
but not all of it.

55
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:07,500
And one more example in Spanish and in 
Italian Dayville Trovata.

56
00:03:08,001 --> 00:03:08,834
When a banker,
these sentences mean I need to find a 

57
00:03:11,021 --> 00:03:13,750
bank.
In these sentences we see need expressed

58
00:03:13,751 --> 00:03:16,060
in different ways than in the last pair 
of sentences.

59
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,700
In Spanish it's tango,
k,

60
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:21,400
in Italian it's devil,
but in Spanish it's also possible to say

61
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,293
table and obvious cognitive devil.
The word meaning to find is also 

62
00:03:25,631 --> 00:03:27,280
different.
In Spanish it's English,

63
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,833
but in Italian it's Audi.
Actually the Spanish word can also mean 

64
00:03:31,871 --> 00:03:34,030
to meet and there's a different Italian 
word,

65
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,260
England throughout it,
which is a cognitive angle,

66
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,920
but it only means to meet,
not to find.

67
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:42,100
Next you can see that the words for bank
are cognates,

68
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,170
but interestingly they have different 
gender.

69
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:45,880
In Spanish,
it's masculine,

70
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:48,580
which we can see from the article soon 
and the Oh,

71
00:03:48,581 --> 00:03:51,220
at the end of uncle and an Italian.
It's feminine,

72
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:54,920
which we can see from the article Una 
and the a at the end of bunker.

73
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,433
So from these examples we can see that 
there's a lot of crossover between 

74
00:03:58,781 --> 00:04:01,270
Spanish vocabulary and Italian 
vocabulary,

75
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:05,470
but there are also some false friends to
watch out for false friends.

76
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,073
No,
I don't mean to face to people who talk 

77
00:04:09,461 --> 00:04:12,470
behind your back.
I mean words that look and sound similar

78
00:04:12,471 --> 00:04:14,980
and either language and likely share a 
common origin,

79
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:17,830
but they have a different meaning or 
usage in each language.

80
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,720
For example,
in Spanish,

81
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,670
but on the door mean soon in Italian,
put on top means ready in Spanish.

82
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:29,110
Whether that means to keep or to guard 
in Italian Guata dot,

83
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:33,610
it means to look at in Spanish means 
office.

84
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:36,160
In Italian,
Oficina means workshop.

85
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,143
There's a different word in Italian you,
which means office in Spanish means 

86
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,940
pregnant,
but in Italian means embarrassed.

87
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:49,540
False friends like these are a common 
source of confusion for people who learn

88
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:50,950
a language that's similar to one.

89
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:54,100
They already know.
If we only look at lexical similarity,

90
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:57,490
Spanish has more in common with 
Portuguese than it does with the Italian

91
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,730
and the Italian has more in common with 
French than it does with Spanish.

92
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:03,880
In either case,
it's 89 percent lexical similarity,

93
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:07,930
but Spanish and Italian are more similar
and pronunciation than those other pairs

94
00:05:07,931 --> 00:05:11,230
of languages which can sometimes lead to
more intelligibility.

95
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:14,260
Pronunciation Spanish has five.
Vowel sounds,

96
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,820
a e,
a.

97
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:18,300
Oh,
Italian also has these five vowels.

98
00:05:18,301 --> 00:05:22,510
Sounds plus two additional ones.
Italian has to east sounds open.

99
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:27,540
He at like the in bed and closed.
He a like the vowel sound in say it also

100
00:05:29,351 --> 00:05:30,011
has to.
Oh,

101
00:05:30,011 --> 00:05:31,340
sounds open.
Oh,

102
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,240
off like the Oh and pop and the closed.
Oh,

103
00:05:34,241 --> 00:05:35,230
sound.
Oh,

104
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,031
like the.
Oh,

105
00:05:36,031 --> 00:05:39,470
and pope and both Spanish and Italian 
have a similar role.

106
00:05:39,471 --> 00:05:40,304
Take our sound.
One notable difference between Spanish 

107
00:05:43,661 --> 00:05:47,800
and Italian pronunciation is that almost
all Italian words end in a vowel,

108
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,540
but in Spanish,
this is not the case.

109
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,060
For example,
in Italian custody,

110
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,073
which means to cost,
but in Spanish it's goes to the Italian 

111
00:05:56,501 --> 00:05:57,334
word,
ends in a vowel while the Spanish word 

112
00:05:58,551 --> 00:06:00,680
ends in a continent.
If you watch out for this,

113
00:06:00,681 --> 00:06:01,514
you'll notice it quite a lot.
Pronunciation and orthography in both 

114
00:06:04,551 --> 00:06:05,384
Spanish and Italian,
C and g become soft when followed by I 

115
00:06:08,721 --> 00:06:09,554
or II,
but the soft sound is different in each 

116
00:06:11,361 --> 00:06:12,830
language.
In Spanish,

117
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:16,580
the soft see sounds like thug or sung.
In Italian,

118
00:06:16,581 --> 00:06:17,414
it sounds like in Spanish,
the soft g sounds like in Italian it 

119
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:24,020
sounds like Joe,
for example,

120
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:24,913
in Spanish and in Italian to Ta,
this means city in Spanish and it means 

121
00:06:32,211 --> 00:06:36,560
people,
but in Italian it's Gente in Spanish,

122
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:40,400
and it either means general.
In Italian it's Gen ed Ali.

123
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,970
Some words like those above are 
cognates.

124
00:06:43,971 --> 00:06:47,030
That sound different.
There are other words that sound similar

125
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,670
but have to be written differently to 
reflect their sound.

126
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:54,350
The word for what in Spanish is k 
spelled with q and an Italian.

127
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:57,170
It's k spelled with a c,
H in Spanish.

128
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,110
If you want to have the hard c sound 
before I or II,

129
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,480
you have to spell it as q.
You in Italian,

130
00:07:02,481 --> 00:07:06,650
you have to spell it as c,
h and while c h always represents a hard

131
00:07:06,651 --> 00:07:11,090
c sound and Italian and Spanish at 
represents the sound like an English,

132
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:15,230
so in Italian you have joke gelatto 
spelled with cei at the beginning,

133
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:18,300
but in Spanish you have that day spelled
with C,

134
00:07:18,301 --> 00:07:22,460
h in Spanish you have wonder meaning 
when and Glenda,

135
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:23,503
meaning how much,
and in Italian you have quandl and 

136
00:07:25,911 --> 00:07:29,030
quantile.
In Spanish you can't write it with q you

137
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,460
because that always represents a hard c 
sound,

138
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,560
so the words would end up sounding like 
a and comfortable.

139
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,713
Some of the differences in pronunciation
and orthography between Spanish and 

140
00:07:38,571 --> 00:07:40,250
Italian are fairly systematic.

141
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,010
For example,
he in Italian often becomes,

142
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:47,390
I eat in Spanish for example.
Temple becomes the MPO.

143
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:51,380
Then day becomes the ending and went an 
Italian.

144
00:07:51,381 --> 00:07:52,214
You Have Sc,
SF or sp or st at the beginning of a 

145
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:58,310
word in Spanish.
These are often proceeded by an IEP.

146
00:07:59,150 --> 00:07:59,983
For example,
[inaudible] in Italian becomes as could 

147
00:08:02,401 --> 00:08:07,401
to be in Spanish and especially in 
Italian becomes a speciality in Spanish.

148
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:13,010
One other thing to note is that double 
consonants are very common in Italian,

149
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:15,680
but in Spanish most consonants can't be 
doubled.

150
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:18,800
For example,
in Italian got Dole means cat,

151
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:23,120
but in Spanish it's that the end in 
Italian means cup,

152
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:24,043
but it's in Spanish grammar.
The general word order of Spanish and 

153
00:08:28,821 --> 00:08:29,654
Italian is very similar.
Have a look at these two sentences in 

154
00:08:32,331 --> 00:08:37,331
Spanish and in Italian,
Louis,

155
00:08:37,431 --> 00:08:39,220
no money,
no money.

156
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,570
You can see that there's some different 
vocabulary,

157
00:08:41,571 --> 00:08:43,400
but the sentences are translatable.

158
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,860
Word for word.
Notice that in both languages,

159
00:08:45,861 --> 00:08:46,694
the subject Pronoun is normally optional
because the verb is conjugated for 

160
00:08:50,031 --> 00:08:50,864
person and number.
Another example in Spanish or in 

161
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:56,610
Italian?
Well,

162
00:08:56,630 --> 00:09:00,150
your scrotum.
This means I wrote him a letter,

163
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:02,760
so here hear the word order is still 
exactly the same,

164
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:06,330
and notice that the object Pronoun comes
before the conjugated verb.

165
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,090
In this case,
the auxiliary verbs in both languages.

166
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,700
Italian grammar has a couple of 
complications.

167
00:09:11,701 --> 00:09:14,040
That Spanish doesn't have.
Articles,

168
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:16,530
articles in Italian or more complicated 
than it.

169
00:09:16,531 --> 00:09:19,020
Spanish in Spanish.
The indefinite articles,

170
00:09:19,021 --> 00:09:23,160
our own for masculine nouns and owner 
for feminine nouns.

171
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,340
Also in Italian,
it's Oona Una,

172
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:29,430
but boone becomes uno before words 
beginning and s or z,

173
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:33,900
followed by another continent and Una 
becomes an apostrophe before unowned,

174
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:36,440
beginning with a vowel,
so in Italian we have past,

175
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,120
but we student debt and we have key ave,
but when Italiana,

176
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,433
Spanish and Italian,
both have four basic definite articles 

177
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,590
in Spanish.

178
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:50,310
They are for masculine singular law,
for feminine,

179
00:09:50,311 --> 00:09:52,440
singular,
for masculine,

180
00:09:52,441 --> 00:09:54,060
plural,
less feminine,

181
00:09:54,061 --> 00:09:57,120
plural.
In Italian,

182
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,360
the ill for masculine,
singular law for feminine,

183
00:10:00,361 --> 00:10:02,550
singular for masculine,
plural,

184
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,653
and lay for feminine plural,
but it'll becomes low before words 

185
00:10:06,871 --> 00:10:07,704
beginning with Srz plus another 
continent and it becomes l apostrophe 

186
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:16,220
before a vowel and eat becomes leaky 
before s or z plus another continent,

187
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:17,543
so we have it'll pass support at all,
but law students which are both 

188
00:10:20,551 --> 00:10:21,384
masculine singular and we have ipass it,
but the identity which are both 

189
00:10:25,771 --> 00:10:26,604
masculine plural,
also both law and lay become l 

190
00:10:30,091 --> 00:10:33,870
apostrophe before vowel possessive 
pronouns.

191
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:36,930
The way possessive pronouns are used is 
also a little bit different.

192
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,003
In Italian,
possessive pronouns are normally used 

193
00:10:39,601 --> 00:10:42,990
together with a definite article except 
when we talk about family members,

194
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:45,780
but in Spanish the definite article is 
not required.

195
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:49,530
So in Italian you have Lamina beachy 
collector and it's Spanish.

196
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:53,280
You have music later,
so notice in Spanish there's no definite

197
00:10:53,281 --> 00:10:54,114
article law.
Another difference to notice here is 

198
00:10:55,861 --> 00:10:56,694
that in Spanish there is no distinction 
between masculine and feminine 

199
00:10:59,221 --> 00:11:00,054
possessive pronouns.
In Italian there's mia for feminine 

200
00:11:02,341 --> 00:11:04,860
singular and meal for masculine 
singular,

201
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,700
but in Spanish there's just me for both 
verbs.

202
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:09,653
The verb tense is used and the way that 
verbs are conjugated is really quite 

203
00:11:12,301 --> 00:11:14,190
similar in both languages.
Of course,

204
00:11:14,191 --> 00:11:16,680
the exact conjugations are not quite the
same,

205
00:11:16,681 --> 00:11:18,930
but they are fairly similar.
Here's a sentence,

206
00:11:18,931 --> 00:11:19,764
meaning they will live in New York.
The verb to live in Italian is vivacity 

207
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:28,370
and in Spanish it's Bev is the sentence 
in Italian lovato and New York.

208
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:32,070
In Spanish,
they just maybe then we can see that the

209
00:11:32,071 --> 00:11:33,120
third person,
plural,

210
00:11:33,121 --> 00:11:33,954
future tense conjugation is similar,
but notice that the Italian one ends in 

211
00:11:37,411 --> 00:11:38,244
a double consonant and vowel.
Now let's look at a sentence in the 

212
00:11:41,071 --> 00:11:42,270
past,
in the present,

213
00:11:42,271 --> 00:11:42,660
perfect.

214
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,493
To be precise,
this sentence means she bought too many 

215
00:11:45,331 --> 00:11:49,710
things in Italian layout and it's 
Spanish.

216
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:55,070
Yet the present perfect tense is formed 
the same way in both languages.

217
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:57,760
First,
here is the auxiliary verb,

218
00:11:57,761 --> 00:12:02,020
meaning to have have edit in Italian or 
in Spanish.

219
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:04,690
That's followed by the past participle 
of the verb,

220
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:09,691
meaning to buy [inaudible] in Italian 
and in Spanish.

221
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,780
One thing to note about the present 
perfect tense is that an Italian,

222
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:17,230
most verbs take the auxiliary verb,
Aveda to have,

223
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:21,360
but some verbs take std meaning to be as
their auxiliary verb.

224
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,383
That's similar to in French,
but in Spanish the only auxiliary verb 

225
00:12:24,941 --> 00:12:28,990
is I've added meaning to have,
so in Italian there's a in Toronto,

226
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,510
meaning he entered,
but in Spanish it's I am data.

227
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,383
Those are just a couple of examples,
but basically all verb tenses and all 

228
00:12:37,331 --> 00:12:38,164
verb forms have an equivalent or a 
parallel in the other language bringing 

229
00:12:41,141 --> 00:12:41,974
it altogether.

230
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:45,370
Let's just look at a couple more 
sentences and see what we find along the

231
00:12:45,371 --> 00:12:46,204
way.
This sentence means Maria is less 

232
00:12:47,861 --> 00:12:52,861
intelligent than her sister in Spanish 
as is of manner and an Italian mother.

233
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:55,843
Men though he did the suicide ella.
Here we can see that the word order is 

234
00:12:59,381 --> 00:13:02,650
the same and we can basically translate 
the sentence is word for word.

235
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:06,010
The third person,
female form of the verb to be is similar

236
00:13:06,011 --> 00:13:06,844
but slightly different.
The word for less is similar but 

237
00:13:09,521 --> 00:13:12,670
slightly different.
The word for intelligent is similar,

238
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:16,810
but in Spanish the g sound is softened 
to a cup while an Italian,

239
00:13:16,811 --> 00:13:20,310
it's softened to a job and the Italian 
word has a doubled l.

240
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:24,340
The preposition used is also different.
The possessive Pronoun is similar,

241
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:25,203
but in Spanish there is no gender 
distinction and the word for sister is 

242
00:13:28,061 --> 00:13:31,600
different in the two languages,
as you can see,

243
00:13:31,601 --> 00:13:32,434
Spanish,
Italian have a lot of similarities 

244
00:13:33,851 --> 00:13:35,740
including basically the same word,
order,

245
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:36,603
similar grammar,
a lot of similar vocabulary and 

246
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,140
generally speaking,
similar pronunciation,

247
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,090
but there are still significant 
differences,

248
00:13:43,091 --> 00:13:46,330
particularly in vocabulary,
pronunciation and slash or photography.

249
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:50,170
They are different enough that they are 
unmistakably two different languages,

250
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,033
but they're similar enough that there is
a certain degree of mutual 

251
00:13:53,171 --> 00:13:54,004
intelligibility and that degree of 
mutual intelligibility can probably be 

252
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:00,760
greatly increased by studying even the 
basics of the other language,

253
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,713
but producing the other language 
accurately is obviously another matter 

254
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,610
and that would require dedicated study.
Okay.

255
00:14:06,611 --> 00:14:09,730
The question of the day for native 
speakers of Spanish and Italian,

256
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,593
how well can you understand the other 
language both in speech and in writing 

257
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,313
and have you ever tried to converse with
a speaker of the other language using 

258
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,063
only your native languages?
How did that work out and for learners 

259
00:14:20,711 --> 00:14:21,544
of Spanish and Italian?
How much does your knowledge of one of 

260
00:14:23,441 --> 00:14:25,750
those languages help you make sense of 
the other?

261
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:28,780
Let us know in the comments down below.
Be sure to follow Lang,
