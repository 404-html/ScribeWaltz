Hello everyone.
Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel,

2
00:00:03,071 --> 00:00:07,390
and my name is Paul,
and this is mystery languages.

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,330
If you've seen one of these before,
then you know how it goes.

4
00:00:10,331 --> 00:00:12,550
All play some audio of a language for 
you,

5
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:16,240
or I'll show you a written sample of a 
language and you can guess what language

6
00:00:16,241 --> 00:00:17,074
it is.
And if you don't know what language it 

7
00:00:18,071 --> 00:00:20,410
is,
maybe you can guess what language family

8
00:00:20,411 --> 00:00:24,070
it belongs to or what country it's 
spoken in or anything like that.

9
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:25,383
And similar to last time,
today's samples were submitted by Lang 

10
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:31,450
focus viewers on instagram.
So let's get into the first language.

11
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,433
Please listen.

12
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:38,080
[inaudible] am [inaudible] [inaudible] 
they moose values and the mice can throw

13
00:00:39,691 --> 00:00:40,524
cans.
