Hello everyone.
Welcome to the Lange focus channel.

4
00:00:08,061 --> 00:00:12,530
And My name is Paul.
Today's video is mystery languages for,

5
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:15,800
and you get the mystery languages for 
each language.

6
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:18,230
I'll give you an audio sample to listen 
to.

7
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,960
And after that I'll give you a written 
sample of the language.

8
00:00:20,961 --> 00:00:21,794
And so you can see what it looks like.
And then I'll give you a moment to make 

9
00:00:24,321 --> 00:00:25,154
a note of your answer to make a note of 
your guests before I reveal the answer 

10
00:00:28,191 --> 00:00:30,980
to you.
So let's begin with the first language.

11
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,073
Yeah.
