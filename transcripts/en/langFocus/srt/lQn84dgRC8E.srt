Hey Mahmud,
can you help me read this Arabic message

2
00:00:02,311 --> 00:00:04,650
I got and I can't recognize any of the 
words.

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:07,050
Oh,
that's not Arabic.

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,850
Hello everyone.
Welcome to the Lange focus channel.

5
00:00:11,851 --> 00:00:12,684
My name is Paul.
In a recent video I talked about the 

6
00:00:14,821 --> 00:00:17,070
Persian language which is spoken in 
Iran,

7
00:00:17,071 --> 00:00:17,904
Afghanistan and Tajikistan because Iran 
is located in the Middle East next to 

8
00:00:21,571 --> 00:00:22,404
Iraq.
A lot of people wonder if the Persian 

9
00:00:23,971 --> 00:00:24,804
language and Arabic are related.
Well they are not directly related but 

10
00:00:28,441 --> 00:00:29,274
they have influenced each other.
Persian and Arabic belonged to 

11
00:00:31,831 --> 00:00:32,664
completely different language families,
which means that they have separate 

12
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:35,933
origins.
Arabic is a Semitic language and it 

13
00:00:37,561 --> 00:00:40,200
comes from the same root language as 
Hebrew,

14
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:41,850
Aramaic,
phoenician,

15
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,170
go riddick,
et cetera.

16
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,930
Persian on the other hand is an Indo 
European language,

17
00:00:45,931 --> 00:00:46,764
the shares common roots with the 
languages of northern India as well as 

18
00:00:49,741 --> 00:00:52,050
most of the languages in Europe such as 
English,

19
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:53,070
French and German.

20
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:54,083
Therefore,
Persian and Arabic have very different 

21
00:00:55,561 --> 00:00:58,440
grammar and the way that words are 
constructed is completely different.

22
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,520
Semitic languages have a unique system 
of mostly three letter roots,

23
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:03,354
and these three that are roots are put 
into templates that form the shape of 

24
00:01:06,601 --> 00:01:08,070
different words.
For example,

25
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,000
the Arabic root for learn,
which in English is like drs.

26
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:13,800
If you want to say,
I learn,

27
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:17,190
you take those three root letters and 
you add them into this template here and

28
00:01:17,191 --> 00:01:18,024
say odd reus Persian does not have this 
system of putting the root into 

29
00:01:22,561 --> 00:01:23,394
templates.
The root words stay in one piece and 

30
00:01:25,261 --> 00:01:26,094
affixes are attached to it.
So let's look at an example in Persian 

31
00:01:29,251 --> 00:01:31,770
using the root word done,
which means no,

32
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,190
the first word is [inaudible],
which means to know.

33
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:39,660
So if we add the ethics Istan,
that creates the infinitive of the verb.

34
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:42,570
The next word is dawn Nash,
which means knowledge.

35
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:47,630
So the ethics ash creates an abstract 
now than if we take that word and we add

36
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:50,790
another ethics at the end.
Donesh Monday,

37
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,090
that means scientist.
So that creates a concrete now.

38
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:56,830
So you can see that nothing is changing 
with the route where.
