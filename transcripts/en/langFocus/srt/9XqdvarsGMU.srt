Hello everyone.
Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and 

3
00:00:07,411 --> 00:00:08,244
my name is Paul.
Today we'll be talking about languages 

4
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:14,250
without verb tenses,
languages without verb tenses,

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:15,203
how's that possible speakers of English 
and other Indo European languages and I 

6
00:00:18,871 --> 00:00:19,704
guess other languages too might take it 
for granted that the basic features of 

7
00:00:22,861 --> 00:00:25,710
their language must be present in other 
languages as well,

8
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:26,663
but that's not always the case.
One example of this is verb tense using 

9
00:00:29,971 --> 00:00:33,960
a particular form of a verb to show the 
time period of an action past,

10
00:00:33,961 --> 00:00:34,794
present,
or future as they exist on a timeline 

11
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,450
and English.
We basically have these three tenses.

12
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:40,493
Present tense is represented by the 
simple verb stem like play for example 

13
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,353
with regular verbs.
The past tense is represented by the 

14
00:00:47,461 --> 00:00:52,461
stem plus the inflection ed like played 
and the simple future tense is formed by

15
00:00:53,341 --> 00:00:57,120
placing the modal auxiliary verb will 
before the infinitive,

16
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,050
which is based on the verb stem minus 
two for example,

17
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:01,913
we'll play.

18
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:02,873
Some linguists might argue that this 
future form is not actually a verb 

19
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:07,470
tense.
We'll come back to that later,

20
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,660
but some languages don't have verb 
tenses,

21
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,290
meaning they don't have different verb 
conjugations to show periods of time.

22
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,020
This is true of many creole languages,
for example,

23
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:16,883
of Indonesian and Malaysian of Chinese 
have many native American languages and 

24
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:23,370
a lot more.
Here's an example from Indonesian.

25
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,620
Here's the verb,
meaning pay in the past,

26
00:01:25,621 --> 00:01:26,454
present and future.
Mumbai Outta the form of the verb is 

27
00:01:28,951 --> 00:01:32,910
exactly the same and all three tenses,
and this might sound strange to you,

28
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:33,803
how can they clearly communicate without
being able to say when an action takes 

29
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:37,620
place?
Well,

30
00:01:37,621 --> 00:01:38,454
first of all,
it's normally not that hard to guess 

31
00:01:39,961 --> 00:01:42,120
from context.
Just to illustrate,

32
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:42,983
let's take the English word put,
which is the same in the present tense 

33
00:01:45,571 --> 00:01:46,404
and past tense.
I put my keys on the table so it was 

34
00:01:48,781 --> 00:01:49,614
that sentence,
present tense or past tense in the 

35
00:01:51,871 --> 00:01:53,370
middle of a story taking place.

36
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:55,680
In the past it would probably be past 
tense,

37
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,490
but if someone were describing that 
action as part of their daily after work

38
00:01:59,491 --> 00:02:01,950
routine than it would probably be 
present tense.

39
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,500
Context can clarify the time of an 
action.

40
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,633
Aside from general context.
There are other ways of indicating when 

41
00:02:08,131 --> 00:02:08,964
an action takes place first through our 
words and expressions that indicate a 

42
00:02:11,971 --> 00:02:15,090
specific time that the action takes 
place like today,

43
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,380
yesterday,
next week,

44
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:17,670
last year,
et cetera.

45
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:21,000
Second,
there are adverbs that indicate aspect.

46
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,360
For example,
so the mum Biota,

47
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,420
which basically means already paid sit 
dung,

48
00:02:26,421 --> 00:02:27,254
Mumbai Iota,
which means in the process of paying 

49
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,353
Massey Mumbia,
which means still paying these adverbs 

50
00:02:33,241 --> 00:02:34,074
show aspect.
What's the difference between tensen 

51
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,130
aspect?
As I mentioned before,

52
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,040
temps indicates the time period of an 
action past,

53
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:41,874
present,
or future aspect deals with the way 

54
00:02:43,681 --> 00:02:47,550
actions unfold in relation to the 
timeline rather than where they occur.

55
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:48,383
On the timeline.
Suda shows that an action is completed 

56
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,190
with the focus on the result of the 
action.

57
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,533
We could call this perfect aspect,
sit down marks the imperfection of 

58
00:02:57,631 --> 00:03:02,631
aspect showing that an is in progress,
but the action is not necessarily in the

59
00:03:02,711 --> 00:03:03,544
present tense.
Massey also marks the imperfect of 

60
00:03:05,681 --> 00:03:08,290
aspect,
showing that an action is continuing,

61
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,410
but with an emphasis on the fact that 
it's not yet finished.

62
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,470
These are just three of the many aspect 
markers in Indonesian.

63
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:17,050
Another language without tenses is 
Mandarin.

64
00:03:17,051 --> 00:03:17,884
Chinese.
I mentioned this in my video comparing 

65
00:03:20,021 --> 00:03:20,854
Chinese and Japanese,
but unfortunately I messed up my 

66
00:03:22,991 --> 00:03:26,050
explanation a little bit.
Here's the present tense sentence I gave

67
00:03:26,051 --> 00:03:27,670
him.
That video will achieve.

68
00:03:27,671 --> 00:03:30,370
She sell.
This means I go to school.

69
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,263
The verb she is the same.
No matter what period of time it takes 

70
00:03:34,331 --> 00:03:35,164
place in,
but there are words that can be placed 

71
00:03:37,031 --> 00:03:39,520
before or after the verb which show 
aspect.

72
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:40,810
Well,
it should I share.

73
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:46,000
This means I went to school,
indicates the perfective aspect,

74
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:46,893
viewing an action in its entirety 
including its completion at a point in 

75
00:03:49,841 --> 00:03:52,150
time.
This is often thought of as a past tense

76
00:03:52,151 --> 00:03:52,984
marker,
but in certain contexts it can be used 

77
00:03:54,971 --> 00:03:56,830
with future events.
For example,

78
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,550
this means I'll call you after I've had 
a meal tomorrow.

79
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:07,870
Time can also be indicated with 
time-related vocabulary,

80
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,860
so let him what?
Chyna.

81
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:11,703
This means yesterday I went to school.
You can see that we've added the word 

82
00:04:14,561 --> 00:04:16,450
for yesterday.
In this sentence,

83
00:04:16,451 --> 00:04:17,284
we actually still need the perfective 
aspect marker because the verb here is 

84
00:04:20,531 --> 00:04:23,140
an action verb with a definite start and
finish,

85
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:26,440
but in some sentences the perfective 
aspect marker is not needed,

86
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:29,280
for example,
so let's will coc.

87
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:30,453
This means yesterday I arrested here.
There's no aspect marker and the only 

88
00:04:33,461 --> 00:04:36,100
indication of time is the word meaning 
yesterday.

89
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,850
Here's a sentence with a different 
aspect marker.

90
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:40,620
Well,
sad.

91
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,110
She she,
I saw the Lou Shannon.

92
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,263
This means I'm on the way to school.
This word that shows in perfective 

93
00:04:46,721 --> 00:04:50,110
aspect indicating an action that is in 
progress and again,

94
00:04:50,111 --> 00:04:54,430
not necessarily in the present and this 
part at the end here means on the road.

95
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,310
These are two common aspect markers and 
mandarin,

96
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,173
but there are others.
The main thing to notice with the 

97
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:04,540
Indonesian and Mandarin examples is that
the verb itself has not conjugated.

98
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:08,380
You simply place a different word and 
aspect marker next to the verb.

99
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:11,830
It's actually very common for languages 
to not have tents,

100
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:15,640
but I've never heard of a language that 
doesn't have aspect in many languages.

101
00:05:15,641 --> 00:05:16,474
Tencent aspect combined together to form
various verb conjugations and many 

102
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:22,870
people really don't distinguish between 
the two concepts.

103
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,793
For example,
in English we have the present tense as 

104
00:05:25,481 --> 00:05:26,314
in I work and we have another form I'm 
working which is in the present tense 

105
00:05:30,101 --> 00:05:30,934
but with progressive aspect and we have,
I have worked which is in the present 

106
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:35,374
tense but with perfect aspect showing a 
connection between a past event and the 

107
00:05:38,951 --> 00:05:39,610
present.

108
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:43,030
People tend to think of all of these 
different verb constructions as tenses,

109
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,670
but strictly speaking there is more than
just tense there.

110
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:46,563
There are certain languages that do have
tenses but not all of them in 

111
00:05:49,121 --> 00:05:49,954
particular.
It's quite common for languages to show 

112
00:05:51,471 --> 00:05:54,160
no distinction between present tense and
future tense.

113
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,260
This is the case with Japanese for 
example,

114
00:05:56,261 --> 00:05:57,094
which has two tenses.
Past and non past could mean I eat 

115
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:02,624
Japanese food in the general sense or 
I'll eat Japanese food in a specific 

116
00:06:06,921 --> 00:06:07,820
case.
In the future.

117
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,713
It's normally not hard to tell the 
difference based on context and there's 

118
00:06:11,421 --> 00:06:13,910
another form Tay you do,
or t Mohs,

119
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:14,863
which represents a continuing action or 
continuing state incorporating uses of 

120
00:06:18,381 --> 00:06:20,810
both progressive as well as perfect 
aspect.

121
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,600
People often think this is strictly a 
present tense form,

122
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:25,790
but it can also be used for future 
actions.

123
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:26,683
For example,
the sentence means I can't believe that 

124
00:06:34,191 --> 00:06:37,220
around this time next week I'll already 
be living in Canada.

125
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,463
Here you can see that the verb say 
[inaudible] is in the Teo to form 

126
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:42,643
representing progressive aspect,
but the action takes place in the 

127
00:06:45,111 --> 00:06:45,944
future.
Many linguists would even argue that 

128
00:06:47,571 --> 00:06:48,404
English has no future tense.
That's because there are no inflections 

129
00:06:50,961 --> 00:06:51,794
on the main verb to show future tense,
but it's shown instead using a modal 

130
00:06:54,861 --> 00:06:55,694
auxiliary specifically will modal 
Auxiliaries and general indicate 

131
00:06:59,031 --> 00:07:01,820
likelihood ability,
permission and obligation.

132
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,833
We'll does express future action,
but syntactically it works like a modal 

133
00:07:06,141 --> 00:07:06,974
auxiliary and there's also the 
construction going to which can be 

134
00:07:10,071 --> 00:07:12,590
placed in front of the main verb,
indicate the future.

135
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:13,813
Semantically speaking,
English can express the meaning of the 

136
00:07:15,891 --> 00:07:16,724
future tense using these constructions,
but grammatically they're not really a 

137
00:07:19,751 --> 00:07:21,140
future tense.
But again,

138
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:24,170
most people tend to think of that as the
future tense in English.

139
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,273
Indeed,
many of the verb forms that we tend to 

140
00:07:26,751 --> 00:07:30,170
think of as tenses include elements 
other than tents.

141
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,183
Take French for instance,
which is usually thought to have 14 

142
00:07:33,681 --> 00:07:34,514
tenses,
seven simple tenses and seven compound 

143
00:07:36,741 --> 00:07:39,470
tenses.
But the seven compound tenses contain an

144
00:07:39,471 --> 00:07:40,304
element of aspect.
Show them through the use of auxiliary 

145
00:07:42,651 --> 00:07:43,484
verbs and the conditional and 
subjunctive forms show distinctions in 

146
00:07:46,221 --> 00:07:47,054
mood.
The conditional form suggests that one 

147
00:07:48,951 --> 00:07:49,784
action is dependent upon another and the
subjunctive form indicates desire or 

148
00:07:53,391 --> 00:07:54,224
probability.
These are moods and even though they 

149
00:07:56,091 --> 00:07:59,810
have separate verb forms and are often 
referred to as separate tenses,

150
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:00,763
they really express both tents and mood.
So verb tenses may work differently in 

151
00:08:04,581 --> 00:08:05,414
different languages,
and some languages may lack grammatical 

152
00:08:07,611 --> 00:08:08,444
verb tense entirely,
but that doesn't mean that they can't 

153
00:08:10,431 --> 00:08:12,980
express those different time periods in 
other ways,

154
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:13,903
whether from context,
from the use of time expressions like 

155
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:19,850
tomorrow from the use of aspect or from 
the use of modal auxiliaries,

156
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:22,940
when some people hear that there are 
languages with no verb tense,

157
00:08:22,941 --> 00:08:26,780
they imagined that the speakers of these
languages have no understanding of time,

158
00:08:26,781 --> 00:08:27,614
that they can't plan for the future or 
that they can't remember the past or 

159
00:08:30,141 --> 00:08:30,980
something like that.

160
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:34,310
But that's not the case at all.
We're all humans after all,

161
00:08:34,311 --> 00:08:37,370
and we all find ways to communicate the 
same basic things.

162
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:38,263
The question of the day,
does your language have special verb 

163
00:08:40,401 --> 00:08:42,230
forms to express past,
present,

164
00:08:42,231 --> 00:08:43,064
and future?
Does your language contain a large 

165
00:08:44,661 --> 00:08:47,450
number of tenses that incorporate aspect
and mood?

166
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:48,523
If you're not quite sure,
maybe look it up and find out a little 

167
00:08:50,421 --> 00:08:52,760
bit about it and tell us in the comments
down below,

168
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:56,460
be sure to follow Lang,
focus on facebook and instagram.

169
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:57,323
And once again,
thank you to all of my amazing patrion 

170
00:08:59,371 --> 00:09:00,204
supporters,
especially these wonderful people right 

171
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,620
here on the screen for their monthly 
pledges.

172
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,710
Thank you for watching and have a nice 
day.

173
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,293
Okay.
