1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:00,983
All right,
so I'm looking at the pimsleur website 

2
00:00:02,221 --> 00:00:03,020
right now.
Uh,

3
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:05,430
this is the,
this is the page for pimsleur French,

4
00:00:05,431 --> 00:00:07,380
and this looks really good.
I think I'm going to buy this.

5
00:00:07,381 --> 00:00:08,730
So let's check the price.

6
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:10,963
Uh,

7
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,120
what's that?
Well,

8
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:15,830
here's the price in pesos.
I wonder how much it is in dollars.

9
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,083
Uh,

10
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:19,550
wait,
that's dollars.

11
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:29,260
Hello folks,
this is Paul.

12
00:00:29,261 --> 00:00:30,094
How you doing today?
I've decided to make this video to give 

13
00:00:32,621 --> 00:00:36,340
you a review about a language program 
called pimsleur.

14
00:00:36,341 --> 00:00:38,830
Pimsleur.
French is the one I wanted to focus on.

15
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:42,440
I've done some other pimsleur courses.
I've done the,

16
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:45,190
I did one level of Arabic right now I'm 
using tagalog.

17
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:48,310
Uh,
I did one level of Hebrew wants,

18
00:00:48,311 --> 00:00:50,540
but the one that I've gone through the 
most is French.

19
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:54,640
I've did four levels of French.
There are five levels now that I've done

20
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:56,950
four of them,
so I thought I'm in the best position to

21
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,080
keep that one in mind and focus on that 
one.

22
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:00,520
Uh,
so pimsleur,

23
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:03,220
right there are five levels.
It's quite good.

24
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:04,183
Um,
I like it but I think it's quite 

25
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,540
expensive and that seems to be one of 
the common complaints is just the price,

26
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:13,390
like it's a,
it's a good quality program to learn the

27
00:01:13,391 --> 00:01:16,060
basic skills of a language,
but it's just really expensive.

28
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:17,623
So if you buy a cds like levels one to 
five would be like 150 cds because 

29
00:01:22,601 --> 00:01:25,990
there's 30 CCS per level.
If you bought them all on cd,

30
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:29,890
that would be,
I think about $1,200

31
00:01:29,891 --> 00:01:32,200
us.
So quite a lot of money,

32
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:33,093
right?
You can get them in digital format and 

33
00:01:35,351 --> 00:01:38,980
MP for about $550,
I believe it was the price.

34
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,650
So less than half price for digital 
format.

35
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:46,120
So you can get that discount and I don't
recommend buying the CDS.

36
00:01:46,121 --> 00:01:46,954
Why would you buy the cds in 2015 when 
you can just get the MP three downloads 

37
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:53,170
for less than half the price.
So I'll do that.

38
00:01:53,171 --> 00:01:56,410
Or if you're a friend or someone happens
to have the cds,

39
00:01:56,411 --> 00:01:59,920
maybe you can borrow them if you feel 
ethically okay with that.

40
00:01:59,921 --> 00:02:03,850
And if you're not worried about Simon 
and Schuster coming to hunt you down and

41
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,110
borrow them,
I don't know,

42
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,720
find a way,
but it's good,

43
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:08,560
but it's expensive.

44
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,720
That's kind of the main thing I wanted 
to start with.

45
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:11,823
But let's talk about what's good.
I'll give you my kind of sandwich 

46
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,633
format.
I'll give you the good than the 

47
00:02:16,691 --> 00:02:17,524
imperfect and then kind of wind up with 
the good and maybe a suggestion on how 

48
00:02:20,321 --> 00:02:21,730
to use it.
So,

49
00:02:21,731 --> 00:02:23,050
um,
the good things first,

50
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:24,003
one good thing is just that it's an all 
audio program and it really gets you 

51
00:02:27,551 --> 00:02:31,480
familiar with the phonology of the 
language and the sounds of the language.

52
00:02:31,481 --> 00:02:32,314
And I'm big on that.
I really think it's important at the 

53
00:02:34,481 --> 00:02:37,420
beginning when you learn a language to 
really get down the phonology.

54
00:02:37,421 --> 00:02:38,254
I think that's what I'm,
that's what helps you sync in that 

55
00:02:40,421 --> 00:02:43,040
language is what is really getting the 
phonology down.

56
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:45,640
That's kind of the access to the inner 
core of the language,

57
00:02:45,641 --> 00:02:46,474
the culture of the language.
Pimsleur helps you do that because 

58
00:02:48,191 --> 00:02:51,310
you're,
you're immersed in the sounds right from

59
00:02:51,311 --> 00:02:54,250
the beginning and you're not relying on 
the visual input.

60
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,173
You're kind of forced to listen to the 
sounds and make sense of them audibly 

61
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:01,270
without having that visual input of 
reading.

62
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:04,600
So it's really good for that.
Uh,

63
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:05,523
so that's one thing and it does it in a 
way that also drills the sentence 

64
00:03:07,781 --> 00:03:08,614
structure.
So you're not just like listening and 

65
00:03:09,641 --> 00:03:12,040
repeating to sounds or phrases or 
sentences.

66
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:14,050
It's actually building up piece by 
piece.

67
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:14,960
Uh,
it's,

68
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,793
it's,
it's really structured in a way that 

69
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:22,600
helps you to build progressively more 
difficult sentences as you go.

70
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,583
Another good thing about pimsleur is 
that it uses something called graduated 

71
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:27,543
intervals,
which is one of the features that it's 

72
00:03:29,201 --> 00:03:32,710
famous for.
I guess a graduated intervals means that

73
00:03:32,711 --> 00:03:33,544
you learn some language,
like a vocabulary or phrase or a 

74
00:03:36,251 --> 00:03:38,830
structure.
Then you review it soon after,

75
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:42,910
after a short interval of time,
but then the next time you review it,

76
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:46,090
the interval of time gets a little 
longer and then the next time you review

77
00:03:46,091 --> 00:03:46,924
it,
there's a little bit longer between the 

78
00:03:47,651 --> 00:03:48,040
reviews.

79
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,010
So the amount of time between each,
uh,

80
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:51,903
each review,
each time you are asked to recall that 

81
00:03:53,891 --> 00:03:58,030
language gets greater and greater.
So that's good for,

82
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:03,540
for basically I'm internalizing it into 
your longterm memory.

83
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,610
The more times that you review that,
that language,

84
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,710
the less frequently you have to review 
it.

85
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:09,603
That's basically the point.
If you're familiar with Hunky 

86
00:04:11,801 --> 00:04:13,390
flashcards,
they use something,

87
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:18,630
a similar system to that where I'm the 
spaced repetition software.

88
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:23,530
If you get the card right,
then the next time you see it is after a

89
00:04:23,531 --> 00:04:26,140
greater interval.
If you get the card wrong or you are not

90
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:26,974
confident about it,
then you see it after a shorter 

91
00:04:28,211 --> 00:04:29,044
interval.
That's something similar to graduated 

92
00:04:30,221 --> 00:04:31,054
intervals.
Another good thing is that it gets you 

93
00:04:32,471 --> 00:04:33,304
just to repeat things a lot,
like you're repeating the same 

94
00:04:34,991 --> 00:04:35,824
structures in the same boat,
a basic vocabulary over and over and 

95
00:04:38,261 --> 00:04:39,094
over,
and when you're first learning a 

96
00:04:40,721 --> 00:04:42,640
language,
it's important to do that.

97
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,473
To repeat things over a lot,
to get some automaticity to get things 

98
00:04:46,601 --> 00:04:49,900
internalized to the point where you can 
say them without really thinking,

99
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:52,390
especially for structures like basic 
sentence structures.

100
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:53,243
That's good because you get those 
structures that come out automatically 

101
00:04:55,631 --> 00:05:00,280
and then you can substitute vocabulary 
and make new sentences that you've never

102
00:05:00,281 --> 00:05:01,240
made before.
So,

103
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:02,220
uh,
it,

104
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:05,620
it drills a lot of that kind of thing.
It gets you repeating a lot,

105
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:06,483
but it does it in a way that always 
seems like you're learning something 

106
00:05:09,161 --> 00:05:10,270
new.
Okay.

107
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:13,930
So onto some of the things that are 
imperfect or things that I need,

108
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:15,850
I think needs to be supplemented or 
whatever.

109
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:16,733
Um,
I don't think that the audio only is 

110
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,393
always sufficient.
There are always some times in a 

111
00:05:23,771 --> 00:05:24,604
pimsleur course where I can't clearly 
hear what the speaker is saying on the 

112
00:05:27,851 --> 00:05:29,090
CDS.
Uh,

113
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,433
I think everyone perceives sounds a 
little bit differently and there are 

114
00:05:32,801 --> 00:05:36,250
sounds that you might be able to 
perceive for easily that I hear them and

115
00:05:36,251 --> 00:05:38,140
I can't quite hear what they're saying.

116
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:39,003
I just don't know what letters those 
would come out to if written down or I 

117
00:05:42,221 --> 00:05:44,500
just,
I can't imagine what the word is.

118
00:05:44,501 --> 00:05:46,920
I can't really perceive the sounds.
Uh,

119
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,210
and in those kind of situations they 
don't really.

120
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,610
They don't know which sounds I'm not 
perceiving.

121
00:05:51,611 --> 00:05:52,444
So they don't clarify it,
so I can't really stick to the pimsleur 

122
00:05:56,441 --> 00:05:57,274
philosophy of only listened to the CD,
only use the audio in that kind of 

123
00:06:00,351 --> 00:06:03,470
situation.
So I break their rules and I reached for

124
00:06:03,471 --> 00:06:04,304
my dictionary and look up a word that 
sounds like what they're saying or I'll 

125
00:06:06,891 --> 00:06:09,770
pause it and I'll try to find,
find out what the word is.

126
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,330
Um,
but I,

127
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:13,850
I need to use some kind of visual input.
Um,

128
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:15,043
having the visual input in that kind of 
situation is really helpful because if 

129
00:06:18,501 --> 00:06:20,720
you can't perceive the sound once you 
see it,

130
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:25,040
then you can perceive it because you'll 
be connecting that mysterious sound with

131
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:25,874
something visual.

132
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:26,980
Right?
Uh,

133
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:30,020
so I,
I don't buy the whole audio only thing,

134
00:06:30,021 --> 00:06:32,720
100 percent.
I think it's really good to have a focus

135
00:06:32,721 --> 00:06:33,554
on audio,
especially in the beginning in that 

136
00:06:34,671 --> 00:06:35,504
solves a lot of the problems of 
traditional learning using just books 

137
00:06:38,361 --> 00:06:42,020
without a lot of audio or like a book 
with just one CD or whatever.

138
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:45,680
Um,
but I think it's still good to have some

139
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:48,890
visual input.
So I think it's good to do this,

140
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:52,520
to do pimsleur in conjunction with other
more visual materials.

141
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:53,743
Another thing is that you just never 
quite learn as much as you think you're 

142
00:06:56,691 --> 00:06:58,040
going to learn.
Uh,

143
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:02,060
I think partly that's because people 
look at the size of the course,

144
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:02,870
like,
Whoa,

145
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:06,710
150 cds for five levels,
or even just like the first two levels.

146
00:07:06,711 --> 00:07:07,930
Wow,
that's 60 cds.

147
00:07:07,931 --> 00:07:11,780
If I finished 60 cds of French,
I'm gonna have to be fluent,

148
00:07:11,781 --> 00:07:11,960
right?

149
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,570
That's 60 whole cds of French.
I'm going to have to be really,

150
00:07:14,571 --> 00:07:17,510
really good after that.
Or they look at the price and they say,

151
00:07:17,511 --> 00:07:18,041
wow,
okay,

152
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:20,240
it's a thousand dollars for five levels.
Uh,

153
00:07:20,241 --> 00:07:21,074
I,
that must make me fluent that better 

154
00:07:22,521 --> 00:07:24,800
make me fluent.
So I'm spending a lot of money on that.

155
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:29,090
But it doesn't really work like that.
It gives you a good basis,

156
00:07:29,091 --> 00:07:34,091
a good basic understanding and a good 
basic anchoring in speaking,

157
00:07:34,491 --> 00:07:37,130
listening,
and interactive skills.

158
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:41,720
It gives you a good basis to build on.
But it's not gonna make you fluent.

159
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,390
So basically I think pimsleur is really 
good.

160
00:07:44,391 --> 00:07:47,030
The only problem I have with it is the 
price,

161
00:07:47,031 --> 00:07:49,080
I just think it's too expensive.
Uh,

162
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,710
I know a lot of work goes into it and 
they can charge whatever they want,

163
00:07:51,711 --> 00:07:55,670
but just a lot of people can't really 
afford to buy all the levels.

164
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:59,630
So that's the,
that's what it is.

165
00:07:59,631 --> 00:08:01,400
It's the price,
but it's good.

166
00:08:01,401 --> 00:08:05,000
It's good quality.
I think it's good for building up your,

167
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,133
your listening and your speaking and 
your oral communication skills without 

168
00:08:09,381 --> 00:08:13,370
relying on the visual too much.
So that solves some of those problems of

169
00:08:13,371 --> 00:08:18,350
traditional learning we had with just 
focusing on written materials too much,

170
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,393
focusing on the visual input too much 
and not being able to translate that 

171
00:08:22,011 --> 00:08:22,844
into conversations.
Pimsleur is kind of one of the ways you 

172
00:08:25,491 --> 00:08:27,440
can solve that problem.
Um,

173
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:30,890
but I don't think pimsleur alone is 
enough.

174
00:08:30,891 --> 00:08:33,890
I think you need to supplement it with 
visual input.

175
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,560
Um,
even at the same time while you're doing

176
00:08:36,561 --> 00:08:38,780
pimsleur,
pimsleur advises you against that.

177
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:41,320
I don't believe that I,
uh,

178
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:42,163
I think you should,
you should supplement with visual 

179
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,000
materials.
Use a textbook,

180
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:46,843
um,
you know,

181
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:47,683
read a authentic materials,
try to use as much visual input as you 

182
00:08:51,201 --> 00:08:51,440
can.

183
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,300
Use other sources,
not just the audio,

184
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,493
right in a top of that,
the audio on the pimsleur cds is 

185
00:08:58,051 --> 00:08:58,861
controlled,
right?

186
00:08:58,861 --> 00:09:00,390
It's controlled practice.
It's,

187
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,150
there's a lot of repeating,
there's a lot of,

188
00:09:02,151 --> 00:09:03,680
um,
uh,

189
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:07,810
there's a lot of just question and 
answer type of a type of structure.

190
00:09:07,811 --> 00:09:11,430
So it's,
it's really limited in what you hear and

191
00:09:11,431 --> 00:09:16,020
what you're expected to produce.
So you need to have experienced from the

192
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,720
beginning in uncontrolled situations,
free practice,

193
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,960
right?
Uh,

194
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:25,250
that means talk with native speakers in 
a context that's not really laid out,

195
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:26,543
that where you're just conversing and 
trying to communicate and figuring out 

196
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:29,874
how to say things.
And you can do that by getting a 

197
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:35,070
teacher,
like a tutor on Italki through skype.

198
00:09:35,071 --> 00:09:35,904
You can take lessons or if someone in 
your town speaks that language and they 

199
00:09:39,001 --> 00:09:39,834
can tutor you or help you out,
you can get a language partner and do a 

200
00:09:41,851 --> 00:09:43,950
language exchange,
something like that.

201
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:47,340
And then use that as your opportunity to
practice communicating.

202
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:48,263
And then when there's a communication 
breakdown or there's like a language 

203
00:09:50,821 --> 00:09:52,440
barrier that can help you get through 
that,

204
00:09:52,441 --> 00:09:53,340
but telling you,
oh,

205
00:09:53,341 --> 00:09:55,560
in this situation we say this and 
whatever.

206
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:56,394
So you learn how to deal with those 
unexpected natural situations that come 

207
00:10:00,211 --> 00:10:04,480
up in real conversations that you won't 
get on the pimsleur cds.

208
00:10:04,481 --> 00:10:05,314
So you need to supplement,
you need the visual input and you also 

209
00:10:08,611 --> 00:10:10,910
need that free practice.
Um,

210
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,940
and if you do the,
all those things in conjunction with the

211
00:10:14,941 --> 00:10:15,774
Pimsleur,
then you're going to come up with a 

212
00:10:16,231 --> 00:10:19,050
really strong base and when you're done 
the courses,

213
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:19,884
you'll be ready to get into some simple 
conversations and then build more and 

214
00:10:22,531 --> 00:10:24,420
more on top of that.
So pimsleur is good.

215
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:26,760
The price,
I don't know what to say about it,

216
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,550
but try to get your hands on them,
use them,

217
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,790
but supplement.
It's not the only thing to use,

218
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:33,624
but it's good.

219
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,173
Wow.
