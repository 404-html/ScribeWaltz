3
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,553
Hello everyone.
Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and 

4
00:00:16,331 --> 00:00:17,164
my name is Paul.
Today's topic is the Malay language or 

5
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:24,790
Bahasa Melayu as it's called in Malay.
People outside of Southeast Asia may not

6
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:25,624
be very familiar with Malaya,
but if we include all speakers of all 

7
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:29,194
varieties of Malay,
it is one of the top 10 most widely 

8
00:00:31,481 --> 00:00:34,390
spoken languages in the world and when I
say widely,

9
00:00:34,391 --> 00:00:39,130
I mean by a large number of people.
It has around 77 million native speakers

10
00:00:39,131 --> 00:00:39,964
and around 173000002nd language speakers
for a total of about $250 million 

11
00:00:44,891 --> 00:00:45,790
speakers.
Of course,

12
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:47,170
different sources give different 
numbers,

13
00:00:47,171 --> 00:00:48,004
but something like that.
It's spoken in Malaysia where it has 

14
00:00:49,811 --> 00:00:50,644
around 18 point $5,
million native speakers out of a 

15
00:00:52,571 --> 00:00:53,404
population of around 32 million people.
Malaysia is an ethnically and 

16
00:00:55,961 --> 00:00:56,794
linguistically diverse place with large 
communities of people speaking Chinese 

17
00:00:59,771 --> 00:01:03,280
and Indian languages as well as numerous
indigenous minority languages.

18
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:05,620
Everyone in Malaysia now learns Malaya 
at school,

19
00:01:05,621 --> 00:01:06,454
but some speakers of other languages 
either aren't fluent in Malay or they 

20
00:01:09,131 --> 00:01:12,160
choose not to speak it very much after 
they graduate from school.

21
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,550
Singapore is another ethnically diverse 
place where Malays are a minority.

22
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:18,160
The Malay language is spoken by around 
700,000

23
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:20,590
people.
There were 13 percent of the population.

24
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:22,053
It has also spoken by around 266,000
people or about 64 percent of the 

25
00:01:26,351 --> 00:01:27,810
population of Brunei.
What?

26
00:01:27,811 --> 00:01:30,130
That.
It's not an idiot.

27
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:31,550
Oh yeah,
sorry.

28
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:33,880
In English we say Brunei.
Oh my God.

29
00:01:33,881 --> 00:01:36,550
You slaughtered the word Bruny.
Okay.

30
00:01:36,551 --> 00:01:38,950
I'm Bernay.
So like I was saying,

31
00:01:38,951 --> 00:01:39,784
it's spoken by around 266,000
people or 64 percent of the population 

32
00:01:43,631 --> 00:01:44,464
of ru.
It has also spoken by around 1 million 

33
00:01:46,151 --> 00:01:48,580
people in southern Thailand adjacent to 
peninsular,

34
00:01:48,581 --> 00:01:51,390
Malaysia and Malaya spoken by around 11 
point two,

35
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:54,760
3 million people in Indonesia.
But that's only part of the story.

36
00:01:54,761 --> 00:01:58,030
There were also about $43,
million native speakers of Bahasa,

37
00:01:58,031 --> 00:02:02,560
Indonesia and around 155 second language
speakers have Bahasa Indonesia.

38
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,740
So what's Bahasa Indonesia?
Well,

39
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:05,583
when speaking of the Malay language,
we need to distinguish between Malaya 

40
00:02:07,781 --> 00:02:08,614
dialects,
which vary from place to place and the 

41
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:11,254
standardized forms of the language,
the first standardized form of the 

42
00:02:13,571 --> 00:02:14,404
languages,
but has some value which is used in 

43
00:02:15,701 --> 00:02:16,600
Malaysia,
Brunei,

44
00:02:16,601 --> 00:02:17,434
and Singapore,
and functions as an umbrella language 

45
00:02:19,091 --> 00:02:19,680
for all of them.

46
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,513
Malaya dialects that are spoken there.
The second standardized form of the 

47
00:02:22,931 --> 00:02:26,680
language is Bahasa Indonesia.
It is used in Indonesia and functions as

48
00:02:26,681 --> 00:02:27,514
a Lingua Franca between speakers of 
different languages because there are 

49
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:30,693
hundreds of languages in Indonesia.
I planned to focus specifically on 

50
00:02:33,131 --> 00:02:35,170
Indonesia and in a different video in 
the future.

51
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:36,123
This is interesting in Malaysia,
the official name of Malaya is Bahasa 

52
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,440
Malaysia,
meaning the language of Malaysia.

53
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:44,740
Instead of Bahasa Melayu,
which means the language of the Malays.

54
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:48,310
This name was chosen to show that the 
language is a language for all Malaysian

55
00:02:48,311 --> 00:02:50,500
citizens and not only for ethnic 
malaise,

56
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:54,130
but some people want to change the name.
Back to Bahasa Melayu history.

57
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,113
Malaya is the most widely spoken 
language in the Austronesian language 

58
00:02:57,941 --> 00:02:58,774
family.
The Austronesian can most likely be 

59
00:03:00,521 --> 00:03:04,510
traced back to a common ancestor,
Prodo Austronesian in what is now Taiwan

60
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,220
around 5,200
years ago,

61
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:08,620
various dialects of rose from protocol 
Austronesian,

62
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,513
one of them being Polynesian,
which began splitting up into various 

63
00:03:12,851 --> 00:03:13,684
languages around 4,000
years ago as Austronesian people 

64
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:17,620
expanded to the south from Taiwan.

65
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:18,603
The Malayan Polynesian sub branch 
includes most of the Austronesian 

66
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,800
languages outside of Taiwan,
a Prodo maleic language,

67
00:03:23,801 --> 00:03:24,634
the ancestor of all Malaya dialects 
probably originated on the island of 

68
00:03:27,611 --> 00:03:32,410
Borneo more than 2000 years ago before 
it speakers migrated west to Sumatra and

69
00:03:32,411 --> 00:03:35,500
the Malay peninsula old Malala,
the beginning of the common era.

70
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,790
And by that I mean after the year one ce
or one add same thing.

71
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:40,624
By the way,
was a time of great Indian influence in 

72
00:03:42,551 --> 00:03:44,750
the region and during this time old 
Molay,

73
00:03:44,751 --> 00:03:47,380
he merged.
It was highly influenced by Sanskrit and

74
00:03:47,381 --> 00:03:48,214
written in Indian scripts like hot lava,
the oldest known inscriptions of old 

75
00:03:51,311 --> 00:03:52,750
Malaya,
the Kudu come Buki,

76
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:56,470
which were found in Sumatra and date 
back to the seventh century ce,

77
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:57,363
the oldest old mill,
a manuscript that still exists today is 

78
00:03:59,501 --> 00:04:00,740
the 10th of June,
Tonna,

79
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:05,260
a legal text from the 14th century still
before Islam was widespread in the area,

80
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,220
classical Malay.

81
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:10,030
Islam soon became dominant in the area 
and trade with the Muslim world,

82
00:04:10,031 --> 00:04:12,520
increased,
resulting in a lot of Arabic and Persian

83
00:04:12,521 --> 00:04:17,020
vocabulary entering the language and 
resulting in the adoption of the script.

84
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,033
John [inaudible] is a version of the 
Arabic script that was modified to suit 

85
00:04:20,231 --> 00:04:22,600
the Malay language during the Malacca 
sultanates,

86
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:25,300
which was like a kingdom and its 
successor,

87
00:04:25,301 --> 00:04:26,134
the Johor Sultanate.
Malaya became widely used as a Lingua 

88
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:30,820
Franca.
During this time,

89
00:04:30,821 --> 00:04:31,654
Islamic literature greatly affected the 
language with more Arabic and Persian 

90
00:04:34,661 --> 00:04:35,494
vocabulary entering Malaya,
and because Malacca was a busy 

91
00:04:38,081 --> 00:04:40,690
international port with people from 
various countries,

92
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:43,480
Malaysia also absorbed vocabulary from 
different languages,

93
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:47,080
Tamil and Chinese languages.
During this classical malaise period,

94
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:47,973
Malaya evolved into something relatively
similar to the Bahasa Melayu and Bahasa 

95
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,873
Indonesia have today.
There were actually two forms of melee 

96
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:56,350
that became widespread during this time 
period.

97
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,380
First,
there was the formal classical malave,

98
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:01,360
which was the state language and the 
language of courts and literature,

99
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:03,940
and there was bizarre Malaya or Malaysia
Passata,

100
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:06,940
a low language spoken by traders as a 
Lingua Franca.

101
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:07,803
Throughout the archipelago bizarre 
Malaya is thought to have been a pigeon 

102
00:05:10,121 --> 00:05:12,310
language featuring vocabulary from 
Malaya,

103
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:15,370
but influenced by other languages such 
as Chinese languages,

104
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:16,323
and there will also local Malaya 
dialects that varied from place to 

105
00:05:18,431 --> 00:05:19,870
place.
Premodern molay.

106
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:23,140
In the 19th century,
European colonial powers were dominating

107
00:05:23,141 --> 00:05:26,230
the region with the Dutch in Indonesia 
and the British and Malaysia.

108
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,753
During this time period,
improvements to the printing press made 

109
00:05:29,651 --> 00:05:30,484
Malaya books and newspapers more widely 
available to the common people so that 

110
00:05:33,581 --> 00:05:34,414
literary Malay or classical ballet was 
no longer just the language of the 

111
00:05:37,481 --> 00:05:38,314
courts and the elite,
the literary Malaya of the Malacca and 

112
00:05:40,451 --> 00:05:42,370
the Johor Sultanates.
In other words,

113
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,233
classical ballet was recognized by the 
British and the Dutch as the standard 

114
00:05:46,571 --> 00:05:49,090
form of the language and became the 
language of education.

115
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:49,983
One notable change during the colonial 
period was the adoption of the Roomi 

116
00:05:52,781 --> 00:05:53,614
writing system,
the use of Roman characters to write 

117
00:05:55,301 --> 00:05:56,134
molay instead of the script and English 
loan words began to trickle into 

118
00:06:01,071 --> 00:06:03,050
Malaysia and the areas under British 
control.

119
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,063
Modern Malaya,
the abundance of Malaya literature in 

120
00:06:05,811 --> 00:06:06,644
the 19th century sparked new enthusiasm 
for the language and Malaya linguists 

121
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:13,010
began their efforts to standardize and 
modernize the language.

122
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:15,200
In 1936,
the Malays scholars,

123
00:06:15,201 --> 00:06:18,230
the above,
published a series of books called Alita

124
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,063
Bahasa,
in which he updated the grammar of 

125
00:06:20,121 --> 00:06:23,660
classical ballet forming the basis of 
Bahasa Melayu in Bahasa,

126
00:06:23,661 --> 00:06:25,850
Indonesia.
In both Malaysia and Indonesia,

127
00:06:25,851 --> 00:06:26,684
the standard form of Malaya became an 
important part of their respect of 

128
00:06:29,091 --> 00:06:32,060
nationalist movements and their struggle
for independence.

129
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:35,000
When Indonesia declared independence in 
1945,

130
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:35,893
Bahasa,
Indonesia became the national language 

131
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:40,750
and when Malaysia became independent in 
1957 Bas,

132
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,593
I'm ally.
You became the national language 

133
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:45,500
dialects.
Bahasa Malaysia was the standard form of

134
00:06:45,501 --> 00:06:48,230
Malaya used in Malaysia and Singapore 
and then Bruni,

135
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:50,660
and it's the form of the language taught
in schools,

136
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:51,583
but there are numerous spoken dialects 
of Malaya that very not only from 

137
00:06:53,841 --> 00:06:54,674
country to country but also from state 
to state and from town to town with 

138
00:06:57,441 --> 00:06:59,600
differences in pronunciation and 
vocabulary.

139
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,553
The Malays spoken at Saba and what tends
to be more similar to that spoken in 

140
00:07:03,771 --> 00:07:04,604
Brunei and Singapore,
but different from the dialects in west 

141
00:07:06,501 --> 00:07:07,334
Malaysia and some states in west 
Malaysia are known for being quite 

142
00:07:09,771 --> 00:07:11,150
divergent.
For example,

143
00:07:11,151 --> 00:07:13,360
the dialects of Colombia,
Colombian borders,

144
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,980
Thailand to the north where a similar 
dialects spoken.

145
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,400
The differences that in on everyone 
learns standard Malaya at school,

146
00:07:19,401 --> 00:07:22,040
but in southern Thailand everyone learns
tie at school.

147
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:22,993
This makes cross dialect communication 
harder for speakers of Malaysia and 

148
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:26,444
Thailand,
but for speakers of other Malaya 

149
00:07:27,621 --> 00:07:30,260
dialects,
Standard Malaysia's a unifying force and

150
00:07:30,261 --> 00:07:33,800
speaking a little more formally can help
people bridge communication gaps.

151
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:37,850
Standard Malaya is also the form of 
Malaya learned by non malaise at school.

152
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:38,803
So Standard Malaya,
sometimes the language of inter ethnic 

153
00:07:40,641 --> 00:07:43,430
communication though some people choose 
to speak English instead.

154
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,520
So what is my lay like?
Like most Austronesian languages,

155
00:07:46,521 --> 00:07:47,354
Malaya is not a tonal language.
It has simple phonology and every 

156
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:52,070
written character represents only one 
sound.

157
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:55,280
In most cases.
It has a simple Svo sentence structure,

158
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,120
for example,

159
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:56,590
right?
Yeah.

160
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:57,750
Mark can tell you

161
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:59,490
meaning,
I eat vegetables,

162
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,240
I don't eat meat.
Now let's add a modal verb.

163
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,720
So yeah,
not my.

164
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:08,240
I don't want to eat meat.

165
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,980
So yeah,
that's not my conducting.

166
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,710
I told me no Zuzu.

167
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:15,840
I don't want to eat meat or drink milk.
Malaya grammar is simple.

168
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,880
First of all,
there's no grammatical gender.

169
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,713
There are also no noun cases.
There was also no plural form in 

170
00:08:25,311 --> 00:08:27,800
Malaysia.
If you want to make a plural explicit,

171
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:30,260
you reduplicate the word or repeat the 
word.

172
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,460
Oh

173
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,300
means a person

174
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,470
all around,
all around

175
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:36,070
means people.
And speaking of autumn,

176
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,093
fun fact.
Ordnung means person in Malaysia who 

177
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:43,100
done means forest in Oregon.
Cooten means forest person,

178
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,620
also known as Orangutang.
Cool.

179
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:50,023
If you want to modify a noun,
you add the modifying word after the 

180
00:08:52,731 --> 00:08:54,950
Noun,
the word for book book.

181
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:58,280
Cool.
Now let's add a demonstrative pronoun to

182
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,453
that book or with a possessive Pronoun 
Crusader my book or Buku Buku saying my 

183
00:09:05,341 --> 00:09:09,690
books or with an adjective inexpensive 
book.

184
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:10,733
In Malaysia,
there is no copy of the verb to be at 

185
00:09:12,571 --> 00:09:15,900
least in regular speech and there is no 
definite or indefinite article,

186
00:09:15,901 --> 00:09:19,200
so we could also mean the book is 
expensive,

187
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:24,150
but to be more clear,
you might say prepositions in Malaya are

188
00:09:24,151 --> 00:09:26,450
very straightforward and intuitive,
so yeah,

189
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:29,700
but I tell Daddy,
can I come from Canada?

190
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:35,140
Now I want to go to the night market at 
dot.

191
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:39,270
There was a discount for students in 
this sentence.

192
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:43,490
Other means there is one of the things 
that makes learning my life fund is that

193
00:09:43,491 --> 00:09:44,324
there are no verb conjugations.
The form of the verb stays exactly the 

194
00:09:46,581 --> 00:09:48,620
same regardless of whether it's in 
present tense,

195
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:49,880
past tense or future tense.

196
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:53,820
So we have the verb meaning to eat in 
present tense on in past tense,

197
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:55,583
in future tense.
Mock on the tents is determined by 

198
00:09:57,511 --> 00:09:58,344
specifying a time period like goodman he
will eat later or by using an adverb 

199
00:10:03,711 --> 00:10:07,290
before the verb game.
He will eat,

200
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:10,223
he already ate or her down.
He is currently eating what he's eating 

201
00:10:15,091 --> 00:10:17,280
now and there are some other adverts 
like this,

202
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:22,200
but of course it's not quite that simple
because we have the verb game to eat,

203
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,153
but we also have the verb Dema came to 
be eaten and they're going to be eating 

204
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:31,350
accidentally and we have the verb moment
came to consume.

205
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:34,920
Then we have moma tend to feed something
to someone.

206
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:38,340
These are examples of one of my most 
challenging features for learners.

207
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:41,730
It's system of building words from roots
and affixes up above.

208
00:10:41,731 --> 00:10:42,564
We created some new verbs,
but we can also create other types of 

209
00:10:44,641 --> 00:10:46,680
words,
not Kenyan food.

210
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:49,730
Matt gain someone who eats,
so boomer.

211
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,793
Nagging means a mediator.
Malaya makes extensive use of this kind 

212
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:54,694
of affixation.
Let's look at one more example of using 

213
00:10:56,411 --> 00:10:58,690
the root word [inaudible],
which means to teach.

214
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:03,860
I didn't teachings to learn to teach 
again,

215
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:10,220
to be taught in transitive,
as in I'm being taught be a gay gain,

216
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:15,090
transitive as in the lesson is being 
taught to study,

217
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:20,700
to be studied by student,
but now gay teacher,

218
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:21,860
Bombilla,
Gauteng,

219
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:22,883
learning bird to be educated.
All of these affixes might seem 

220
00:11:27,261 --> 00:11:28,094
overwhelming at first,
but they're fairly systematic and once 

221
00:11:30,021 --> 00:11:32,720
you get used to the function of all of 
the different affixes,

222
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:33,703
then it helps you to understand words 
that you've never heard before and it 

223
00:11:36,171 --> 00:11:38,540
helps you to guess how to say words that
you don't know yet.

224
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,450
Standard Malaya is a very user friendly 
language for learners,

225
00:11:43,451 --> 00:11:46,150
especially if you're used to learning 
more complex languages.

226
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,193
The biggest challenge that you'll likely
face as the difference between the 

227
00:11:49,271 --> 00:11:50,104
formal language and the casual language 
and the dialectal variation that you'll 

228
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:57,370
especially different pronunciation,
but by learning the standard polite form

229
00:11:57,371 --> 00:11:58,204
of malaria,
you form a good basis for communication 

230
00:11:59,921 --> 00:12:02,920
and you can learn the more colloquial 
style of communication as you go.

231
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,490
Stay tuned for a future episode in which
I cover Bahasa,

232
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:07,323
Indonesia,
and they'll focus in on that form of 

233
00:12:08,081 --> 00:12:10,540
Malays specifically.
