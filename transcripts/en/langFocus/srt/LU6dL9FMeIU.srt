Hello everyone,
welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and 

2
00:00:03,781 --> 00:00:04,614
my name is Paul.
Today's topic is the languages of South 

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,670
Africa.
The Republic of South Africa covers much

4
00:00:11,671 --> 00:00:12,504
of the southern tip of the African 
continent and as a place where numerous 

5
00:00:15,541 --> 00:00:16,374
native African cultures as well as 
former colonial populations have 

6
00:00:19,231 --> 00:00:22,740
converged resulting in a state of true 
linguistic diversity.

7
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,023
South Africa has 11 official languages 
that have been recognized in its 

8
00:00:27,031 --> 00:00:30,750
constitution since 1993.
If that seems like a lot to you,

9
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:33,930
you're probably right.
South Africa is among the countries with

10
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,080
the largest number of official languages
at the national level.

11
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:41,760
Number one is actually neighboring 
Zimbabwe with 16 official languages,

12
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,190
some of which are also official in South
Africa.

13
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:45,443
These are the 11 official languages of 
South Africa in order of most spoken to 

14
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:51,450
least spoken as a first language,
Zulu,

15
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:53,490
Hosa,
Afrikaans,

16
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,440
English,
northern Sudan,

17
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:57,180
Swana,
southern Sudan,

18
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,800
Tsonga,
Swazi,

19
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:01,100
venda,
and in the ballet,

20
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,393
over 99 percent of South Africans to 
speak one of these languages as a first 

21
00:01:05,581 --> 00:01:06,390
language.

22
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:07,223
All of these languages are members of 
the southern through branch of the 

23
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,213
Nigeria Congo language family,
with the exception of Afrikaans and 

24
00:01:13,321 --> 00:01:15,290
English,
which are Germanic languages,

25
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:16,163
brought to the country by Europeans.
The Dutch first arrived in what is now 

26
00:01:19,411 --> 00:01:20,244
South Africa in 16,
Fifty two establishing the Cape colony 

27
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,173
in the western portion of the country.
Also living in this area were native 

28
00:01:27,391 --> 00:01:30,690
Koyczan people and other Africans who 
spoke two languages.

29
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:34,170
The British seized control of the Cape 
Colony in 18,

30
00:01:34,171 --> 00:01:38,100
15 and British settlers began to arrive.
The brewers,

31
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:38,993
the descendants of the original Dutch 
settlers disliked many aspects of 

32
00:01:41,971 --> 00:01:44,700
British rule,
but one of them was the anglicization of

33
00:01:44,701 --> 00:01:45,534
the Cape Colony and the attempt to force
English on the horse as a medium of 

34
00:01:48,481 --> 00:01:49,314
instruction in schools.
They wanted to continue to use Dutch as 

35
00:01:51,991 --> 00:01:54,720
their medium of instruction and to 
continue speaking.

36
00:01:54,721 --> 00:01:57,360
They're distinct dialect of Dutch called
Cape Dutch,

37
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,640
which would later evolve into Afrikaans.

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,833
Boris began the great trek migrating 
inland and creating their own bore 

39
00:02:04,111 --> 00:02:04,944
republics in an area more densely 
populated with African tribes who spoke 

40
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,353
two languages.
The British later took control of the 

41
00:02:11,821 --> 00:02:16,530
board republics and created the Union of
South Africa in 1910 that eventually led

42
00:02:16,531 --> 00:02:18,870
to the creation of the Republic of South
Africa.

43
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,510
From that point on,
there were two official languages,

44
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:22,403
English and Dutch,
but Dutch as spoken by the boers had 

45
00:02:24,751 --> 00:02:27,630
evolved into a distinct language called 
Afrikaans,

46
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:31,080
which replaced Dutch as an official 
language in 1925.

47
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:32,483
These two colonial languages became the 
prestige languages of South Africa and 

48
00:02:35,821 --> 00:02:36,654
Speakers of other languages.
Didn't really have any say in the 

49
00:02:38,431 --> 00:02:40,230
matter.
During the apartheid era,

50
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,720
schools were segregated not only based 
on race,

51
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:46,620
but also based on mother tongue.
Native speakers of English and Afrikaans

52
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:49,020
were taught in their native language 
throughout their schooling.

53
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:52,020
With second language instruction in the 
other official language,

54
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,790
black South Africans were required to 
study in their mother tongue for most of

55
00:02:56,791 --> 00:03:00,430
their primary school years after which 
point then normally studied in English.

56
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,073
But in 1974,
the apartheid government implemented a 

57
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:05,284
new policy requiring instruction in 
black schools to be conducted in a 50 

58
00:03:08,591 --> 00:03:10,990
slash 50 split between English and 
Afrikaans.

59
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:13,480
With the language of instruction,
depending on the course,

60
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:14,613
this was implemented without consulting 
the black population in opposition to 

61
00:03:17,681 --> 00:03:21,250
this move led to the Soweto uprising of 
1976.

62
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,670
Afrikaans was seen as the language of 
the oppressor.

63
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:25,563
Since the apartheid government was 
dominated by white speakers of 

64
00:03:27,851 --> 00:03:28,684
Afrikaans,
while English was seen as a more 

65
00:03:30,101 --> 00:03:30,934
cosmopolitan language.
When apartheid ended in the early 19 

66
00:03:33,761 --> 00:03:34,594
nineties,
a new constitution was written that 

67
00:03:35,951 --> 00:03:36,784
added nine additional African languages 
as official languages in order to be 

68
00:03:39,881 --> 00:03:40,714
more inclusive of the entire population.
The education system now is based on 

69
00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:45,274
freedom of choice with every individual 
free to choose which of the 11 official 

70
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:51,790
languages to be educated in for the 
first part of their schooling.

71
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:55,000
As long as there's sufficient demand for
the school to provide it,

72
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:55,933
that means that they don't have to study
in their mother tongue if they don't 

73
00:03:58,121 --> 00:03:58,954
want to.
Let's take a look at the map of South 

74
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,950
Africa.
When apartheid was abolished,

75
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:03,813
the four provinces of South Africa and 
the homelands enclaves for African 

76
00:04:07,301 --> 00:04:10,810
ethnic groups were abolished and nine 
new provinces were created.

77
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:12,003
This map shows the most dominant 
languages in South Africa down to the 

78
00:04:14,591 --> 00:04:15,424
local level.
You can see that the 11 official 

79
00:04:17,051 --> 00:04:17,884
languages are clustered mainly in 
certain areas and may predominate in 

80
00:04:20,771 --> 00:04:21,604
certain provinces,
but they don't correspond exactly to 

81
00:04:23,591 --> 00:04:24,424
provincial borders.
You can see that Afrikaans predominates 

82
00:04:26,651 --> 00:04:27,484
in the West while the [inaudible] 
language is predominate in the east and 

83
00:04:30,551 --> 00:04:33,580
English predominates in South Africa's 
major urban centers.

84
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,793
As you can see,
there's quite an intricate linguistic 

85
00:04:37,251 --> 00:04:39,370
situation in the eastern part of the 
country,

86
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,070
so let's zoom in and look at the African
languages there.

87
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,113
As I mentioned earlier,
the Non European languages of South 

88
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:48,970
Africa are mainly members of the 
southern Bantu branch of the Niger Congo

89
00:04:48,971 --> 00:04:49,804
language family,
and these account for about 70 percent 

90
00:04:51,821 --> 00:04:54,520
of the population or around 40 million 
people.

91
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:55,683
These southern through languages display
some features typical of the languages 

92
00:04:58,930 --> 00:04:59,763
in general.
They follow an Svo word order like 

93
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:02,874
almost all Bantu through languages.
They're tonal and they're are largely a 

94
00:05:05,521 --> 00:05:09,180
gluten active and feature a large number
of affixes to nouns and verbs.

95
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,690
Most Ben,
two languages do not have click sounds,

96
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,793
but many of these southern Bantu 
language is due as a result of contact 

97
00:05:16,651 --> 00:05:17,484
with the Koyczan languages.
The nine main southern Bantu languages 

98
00:05:20,711 --> 00:05:21,544
of South Africa can be further 
categorized into three smaller 

99
00:05:23,861 --> 00:05:26,230
subdivisions,
the in Goonie languages,

100
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,050
the languages and the Swat.
Ranga or someone,

101
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:30,893
God group vendor forms its own group,
so there are actually four subdivisions 

102
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:35,690
including this one.

103
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,273
The goonie branch of the southern Bantu 
tree contains four of South Africa's 

104
00:05:40,341 --> 00:05:42,020
official languages,
Zulu,

105
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,760
Olsa,
Swazi,

106
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:44,923
and the belay.
The first two are the two most spoken 

107
00:05:47,031 --> 00:05:47,864
languages within South Africa as a first
language with Zulu representing 23 

108
00:05:51,441 --> 00:05:55,700
percent of the population and wholesale 
representing 16 percent of it.

109
00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:00,020
The other two on the other are spoken by
only two point five percent in two point

110
00:06:00,021 --> 00:06:04,370
one percent respectively.
Zulu is mainly spoken in Kwazulu,

111
00:06:04,371 --> 00:06:05,204
Natal,
and most of Puma Langa where Swazi and 

112
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,873
in the belay are spoken as well.
Wholesale is the majority language of 

113
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:13,004
the Eastern Cape,
but has communities have speakers in 

114
00:06:14,901 --> 00:06:17,540
other provinces as well as other 
official languages.

115
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:21,320
Do the Goonie languages feature?
Click consonants.

116
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,900
You can hear one of them in the name of 
the language.

117
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:25,813
Actually,
this is the first time I've tried to 

118
00:06:26,901 --> 00:06:27,734
pronounce a click consonant,
so I may be pronouncing the name of the 

119
00:06:30,021 --> 00:06:32,450
language wrong from the point of view of
a native speaker,

120
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,000
but I guess it's something like that 
whole song.

121
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,670
All of the in Goonie languages are 
mutually intelligible to a large extent,

122
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,920
so to Twana.
The second largest of the southern Bantu

123
00:06:43,921 --> 00:06:47,490
branches is the [inaudible] branch,
which has three languages within it.

124
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,513
Northern [inaudible] representing nine 
point one percent of South Africa's 

125
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:54,600
population Swana with eight percent and 
southern Sudan,

126
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:58,260
or simply with seven point six percent.
Altogether.

127
00:06:58,261 --> 00:07:01,710
They represent just under a quarter of 
the population of South Africa,

128
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,633
around 13 point 6 million people.
Each of these three languages serves as 

129
00:07:06,711 --> 00:07:10,670
the majority language in the province 
that it's most widely spoken in southern

130
00:07:10,671 --> 00:07:14,060
[inaudible] in the free state,
not in the northwest province,

131
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:15,283
and there is also a significant 
population of speakers in the Northern 

132
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,900
Cape with which it shares a border and 
to northern Sudan.

133
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,753
In Limpopo,
southern [inaudible] contains click 

134
00:07:24,521 --> 00:07:27,220
consonants due to contact with an Goonie
languages.

135
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,263
While some urban varieties of northern 
sue to have in recent times been 

136
00:07:30,941 --> 00:07:34,240
acquiring clicks as well,
it's one that uses some click sounds,

137
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:37,510
but only in interjections and video 
phones on the metal,

138
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:40,750
for example,
and like the Goonie languages,

139
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:44,470
the Twana languages are generally 
mutually intelligible as well.

140
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,193
Tsonga or Swati Rhondda,
although there are other languages 

141
00:07:48,811 --> 00:07:52,020
within this branch,
the only one that has official status is

142
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:52,933
Tsonga.
Other languages of this group are 

143
00:07:54,331 --> 00:07:55,164
mutually intelligible and are oftentimes
considered part of the tone of the 

144
00:07:57,571 --> 00:08:01,350
language found in the northeast.
Most of the Tsongas speaking,

145
00:08:01,351 --> 00:08:06,351
people live in Limpopo or Puma Malanga.
Some features click sounds in just a few

146
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:08,940
words.
Another interesting phonological feature

147
00:08:08,941 --> 00:08:09,774
is whistled sibilant consonants.
I haven't been able to find a sample 

148
00:08:12,751 --> 00:08:13,584
from Tonga,
but here's a sample of a similar sound 

149
00:08:15,331 --> 00:08:16,500
in the [inaudible] language

150
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:28,203
vendor,
one of the less spoken of the official 

151
00:08:29,831 --> 00:08:30,664
languages in South Africa.
Venda comprises two point four percent 

152
00:08:33,311 --> 00:08:34,144
of the population or one point $3 
million speakers who are almost all 

153
00:08:37,211 --> 00:08:41,830
concentrated on the northern border of 
Limpopo near Zimbabwe where it's closest

154
00:08:41,831 --> 00:08:44,440
linguistic relatives.
Live vendor has no click.

155
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:47,190
Sounds okay.
Afrikaans and English,

156
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:49,710
the two Germanic languages of South 
Africa,

157
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:50,693
Afrikaans and English or the third and 
fourth most spoken languages in the 

158
00:08:53,761 --> 00:08:54,594
country with 13,
five percent and nine point six percent 

159
00:08:57,511 --> 00:09:00,660
of citizens speaking them as their first
language respectively.

160
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:01,943
People outside of South Africa might 
assume that native speakers of Africans 

161
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:07,050
are all white,
but that's not the case.

162
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:09,640
It's the majority language in the 
Northern Cape.

163
00:09:09,641 --> 00:09:10,474
Then Western Cape provinces where most 
of the nation's colored population or 

164
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:14,363
mixed race population lives and more 
than 75 percent of colored South 

165
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,820
Africans speak Afrikaans as their first 
language.

166
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,193
Why is that?

167
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,050
It's because they were part of the 
language is development.

168
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:29,280
The origin of the colored community lies
in the early days of the colony.

169
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,173
When Dutch settlers intermarried with 
indigenous Koyczan women or slaves from 

170
00:09:33,271 --> 00:09:35,310
Africa,
India and Southeast Asia,

171
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:36,503
but they also interacted linguistically 
and by learning Dutch in perfectly as a 

172
00:09:39,631 --> 00:09:40,464
second language.
They influenced the direction of the 

173
00:09:42,031 --> 00:09:44,730
Dutch dialect that would evolve into 
Afrikaans.

174
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:45,773
It's also spoken as a native language by
smaller numbers of the South Asian and 

175
00:09:48,751 --> 00:09:49,584
black South African populations and it's
spoken by over 60 percent of the white 

176
00:09:53,131 --> 00:09:55,620
population as a native language in 
total.

177
00:09:55,621 --> 00:09:59,940
It's the first language of about 13 
point five percent of the population and

178
00:09:59,941 --> 00:10:02,730
it's spoken by an even larger number as 
a second language.

179
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,990
If you haven't seen my language profile 
on Afrikaans from a couple of years ago,

180
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:11,310
you can check it out right here.
English is spoken as a native language,

181
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,173
mainly in the Western Cape,
how attain and Zulu natal as these are 

182
00:10:15,571 --> 00:10:17,310
aware of the major cities can be found.

183
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:20,190
Plus it's widely spoken as a second 
language,

184
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:24,630
English as the native language of nine 
point six percent of the population,

185
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,450
including around 36 percent of the white
population.

186
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:30,720
It's also the native language of most 
Indian South Africans.

187
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,790
They speak with an accent distinct from 
white South Africans,

188
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:36,750
speakers of English during the apartheid
era,

189
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:40,650
interaction with whites was limited,
which allowed their own distinct variety

190
00:10:40,651 --> 00:10:43,820
of English to develop in isolation with 
some fun,

191
00:10:43,821 --> 00:10:46,080
illogical influences from Indian 
languages.

192
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:48,143
I've mentioned the Koyczan languages a 
few times and you may be wondering why 

193
00:10:51,031 --> 00:10:53,070
they aren't on the list of official 
languages.

194
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:54,953
Well,
the Koyczan where the first indigenous 

195
00:10:56,341 --> 00:10:57,174
people have much of South Africa before 
the migration of Ben to peoples and 

196
00:11:00,211 --> 00:11:03,030
later Europeans through conflict with 
Ben too,

197
00:11:03,031 --> 00:11:03,864
and Europeans Koyczan were driven into a
much smaller area and now most Koyczan 

198
00:11:07,861 --> 00:11:11,940
live in the Kalahari desert.
Some Koyczan intermarried with Europeans

199
00:11:11,941 --> 00:11:12,774
and became part of the colored 
population while others died from 

200
00:11:15,211 --> 00:11:16,410
conflict and disease.

201
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:18,203
The end result of all this is that only 
a very small population of Koyczan 

202
00:11:21,271 --> 00:11:22,104
remain in South Africa and their Koyczan
languages are therefore not widely 

203
00:11:25,411 --> 00:11:26,244
spoken and are not official languages.
Koyczan languages do not form a single 

204
00:11:30,601 --> 00:11:33,900
language family and are not accepted as 
being related to each other,

205
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,410
but all of them feature extensive use of
click consonants.

206
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,930
As I stated before,
the click sounds used.

207
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:43,260
[inaudible] languages come from contact 
with Koyczan languages.

208
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,453
The most widely spoken Koyczan language 
in South Africa is [inaudible] or 

209
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,640
[inaudible] with around 50,000
speakers.

210
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:55,300
This language has an additional 250,000
speakers in neighboring Namibia.

211
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,033
There are other Koyczan languages in 
South Africa that are severely 

212
00:11:59,471 --> 00:12:00,304
endangered like Greek,
well with only a few dozen speakers 

213
00:12:02,771 --> 00:12:03,604
remaining language in society.
In a society with such linguistic 

214
00:12:08,201 --> 00:12:10,630
diversity,
it's inevitable that the majority of the

215
00:12:10,631 --> 00:12:13,210
population will be bilingual or 
multilingual.

216
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:14,493
Most white and colored South Africans 
are bilingual and English and Afrikaans 

217
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,980
and a smaller number of speak,
one of the African languages as well,

218
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:26,130
Indian South African speak English and 
usually some Afrikaans and some speak in

219
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,340
Indian language as well.

220
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:28,570
Typically,
older people,

221
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:32,400
many black South Africans speak three,
four,

222
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:33,970
five,
or even more languages.

223
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:36,670
It's common for them to speak their 
native African language,

224
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:40,240
English and Afrikaans and one or more 
other African languages.

225
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,550
They're often able to speak the other 
languages,

226
00:12:42,551 --> 00:12:46,210
have the same sub group as their native 
language because they're closely related

227
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,073
and in many cases mutually intelligible.
You may be wondering if the languages 

228
00:12:50,441 --> 00:12:52,960
within each subgroup or mutually 
intelligible,

229
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:54,910
why are they considered separate 
languages?

230
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:55,923
Well,
what does a language versus what is a 

231
00:12:57,131 --> 00:12:57,964
dialect is a murky issue as always,
but I think it's partly because they 

232
00:13:01,331 --> 00:13:02,164
each have their own standardized variety
and it's partly because each one is 

233
00:13:05,501 --> 00:13:09,520
associated with a distinct ethnic group.
These days,

234
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:10,383
business and politics are emotionally 
conducted in English and English as the 

235
00:13:13,151 --> 00:13:16,420
most common language of broadcast and 
media for a long time.

236
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:19,630
English and Afrikaans had equal status 
as dual lingua.

237
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:23,140
Franca is of South Africa,
but Afrikaans has been declining in that

238
00:13:23,141 --> 00:13:25,930
regard.
That's partly due to the stigma attached

239
00:13:25,931 --> 00:13:28,840
to off recons as it's seen as the 
language of apartheid.

240
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:30,063
In addition to that,
education in South Africa tends to lean 

241
00:13:32,081 --> 00:13:35,050
toward English.
In typical South African schools,

242
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,780
the first three grades are taught in the
student's mother tongue,

243
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:41,950
but after that school work is conducted 
in either Afrikaans or English.

244
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:44,950
Schools can teach in the native language
longer,

245
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:45,813
but since secondary school matriculation
exams are only conducted in English and 

246
00:13:49,001 --> 00:13:52,030
Afrikaans.
There's a strong motivation to switch to

247
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:52,864
one of those languages early on,
but rather than Afrikaans most choose 

248
00:13:56,621 --> 00:13:57,454
English due to its utility and prestige 
and in many cases families will forego 

249
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:05,050
students being taught in their first 
language and go straight into English to

250
00:14:05,051 --> 00:14:05,884
jumpstart their proficiency,
but whether this is a help or a 

251
00:14:08,651 --> 00:14:10,630
hindrance is a source of much debate.

252
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,213
The emphasis on English and Afrikaans 
after the first three or four years of 

253
00:14:15,011 --> 00:14:18,430
initial schooling is a lasting influence
of the colonial era.

254
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:22,900
Today there are 11 official languages 
and in theory and in law they are equal,

255
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:25,810
but in practice,
English and Afrikaans are still the most

256
00:14:25,811 --> 00:14:28,090
influential languages at the national 
level,

257
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:29,163
and this is still the case for now,
despite the fact that Africans has lost 

258
00:14:31,901 --> 00:14:32,734
some of its prestige.
The question of the date for South 

259
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,930
Africans,
which languages do you speak and in what

260
00:14:37,931 --> 00:14:40,900
situations do you use them and for other
people,

261
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:43,300
how many official languages are there in
your country?

262
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:46,090
Do you think that system works well for 
your country?

263
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,610
Be sure to follow lane,
focus on facebook,

264
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,960
twitter,
and Instagram,

265
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:52,730
and once again,
thank you to all of my wonderful patrion

266
00:14:52,731 --> 00:14:53,564
supporters,
especially these ones on the screen who 

267
00:14:55,251 --> 00:14:56,084
are my top tier patrion supporters.
Many thanks to them as always and to 

268
00:14:59,841 --> 00:15:00,674
everyone.
Thank you for watching and have a nice 

269
00:15:02,631 --> 00:15:03,464
day.
