Hello everyone,
welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and 

2
00:00:03,431 --> 00:00:04,264
my name is Paul.
Today we're going to talk about a 

3
00:00:06,671 --> 00:00:11,200
language that partially descended from 
English but is not actually English.

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:16,270
The language is took piece in an English
based Creole language talk.

5
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,450
BCM is one of the official languages of 
Papa New Guinea,

6
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:22,330
which is located in the southwestern 
Pacific Ocean,

7
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:23,343
just north of Australia.
It's other official languages are 

8
00:00:25,841 --> 00:00:26,674
English,
which is not spoken by most of the 

9
00:00:28,151 --> 00:00:28,984
population and hedy Motu,
but talk piecing serves as the most 

10
00:00:31,931 --> 00:00:32,764
common Lingua Franca.
Lingua Franca is certainly useful in 

11
00:00:36,011 --> 00:00:36,844
Papa New Guinea since it's the most 
linguistically diverse country on the 

12
00:00:39,821 --> 00:00:40,654
planet.

13
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:46,973
Okay.
It's the most linguistically diverse 

14
00:00:48,301 --> 00:00:49,134
country in the whole universe.
Over 800 languages are spoken in Papa 

15
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:56,423
New Guinea,
a country of just around 8 million 

16
00:00:57,571 --> 00:01:00,480
people with so much linguistic 
diversity.

17
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:01,343
Talk piecing is frequently used for 
communication between people of 

18
00:01:03,871 --> 00:01:08,070
different linguistic backgrounds.
Look at the name of the language.

19
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:08,933
Talk pc talk means language,
but it comes from the English word talk 

20
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,550
and also means talk,
speech,

21
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,690
word,
message,

22
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,740
news,
etc.

23
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,650
The majority of top piss in words come 
from english,

24
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,160
but are used with different meanings or 
with a wider range of meanings.

25
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,113
This word piecing comes from pigeon,
but probably developed from the english 

26
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:29,630
word business,
not in [inaudible],

27
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:30,503
but rather in the chinese language talk.
Pc has also sometimes been called talk 

28
00:01:34,501 --> 00:01:36,690
boy,
boy comes from boy,

29
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,990
but actually refers to someone who was 
an indentured laborer,

30
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:45,020
servant or slave of colonial europeans 
because their bosses or masters referred

31
00:01:45,381 --> 00:01:46,214
to them as boy talk,
pissing began as a pigeon language on 

32
00:01:48,961 --> 00:01:53,961
the plantations of german Samoa.
Between 1880 and 1914 when laborers from

33
00:01:54,391 --> 00:01:58,890
new Guinea were brought over an english 
based creole in a german territory.

34
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,873
Why?
Well laborers from the Solomon Islands 

35
00:02:02,071 --> 00:02:06,000
and from Vanuatu had already been 
working on plantations in the queensland

36
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:06,834
colony in present day Australia,
and they had already developed an 

37
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:11,220
english based pigeon language.

38
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,840
In short,
they needed a common language for work,

39
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:16,703
so they adopted a small english 
vocabulary and use the grammar of their 

40
00:02:19,651 --> 00:02:22,080
melanesian languages to connect the 
words together.

41
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:23,603
In this way,
a melanesian english based creole 

42
00:02:25,381 --> 00:02:28,330
language overall is in queensland.
Some of these pigeons,

43
00:02:28,331 --> 00:02:29,164
speakers from Vanuatu,
Solomon Islands later worked in german 

44
00:02:31,741 --> 00:02:32,574
Samoa alongside the new Guinea and 
laborers using their pigeon as a lingua 

45
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:36,624
franca.
People from all of these places brought 

46
00:02:38,611 --> 00:02:42,510
the pigeon language home with them where
it became widely used as a lingua franca

47
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,373
and became crystallized,
meaning that it became spoken as a 

48
00:02:45,781 --> 00:02:49,620
native language for some people and 
became used for all functions of life,

49
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,040
not only for the limited functions of 
the original pigeon language.

50
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:54,203
Till this day,
the forms of pigeon spoken in papa new 

51
00:02:56,071 --> 00:03:00,010
Guinea and the Solomon Islands and 
Vanuatu are all quite though.

52
00:03:00,011 --> 00:03:03,460
They have definitely diverged into their
own distinct varieties.

53
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:06,520
After pigeon languages become creole 
languages,

54
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:09,130
there are technically no longer pidgin 
languages,

55
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,130
but they are still referred to as pigeon
in all three countries.

56
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,120
Now let's examine talk pcn and see what 
it's like.

57
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:19,960
Vocabulary as an english based creole 
language talk,

58
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,630
pcn got most of its vocabulary from 
english,

59
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,493
but words of english origin are usually 
pronounced differently according to the 

60
00:03:26,531 --> 00:03:30,040
phonological rules of the austronesian 
languages of melanesia.

61
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,353
For example,
brother is pronounced enough in before 

62
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:42,460
shark suck.
Stand or stand up,

63
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:47,730
sun up words of english origin are also 
generally used differently than they are

64
00:03:48,851 --> 00:03:50,680
in english.
For example,

65
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,633
class from the english word place in tok
pc in this means village or hometown 

66
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:01,440
area or region from the english word,
devil means soul shadow,

67
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:05,740
reflection or image plus two from 
english,

68
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:10,770
close to means close to but also nearly 
or almost place months from english.

69
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:15,400
Christmas means birthday and not just to
christ's birthday.

70
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:19,780
Anyone's birthday.
Since the vocabulary of talked pcn stems

71
00:04:19,781 --> 00:04:24,190
from a small english vocabulary.
Oftentimes one word is used to represent

72
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:27,820
a wide range of synonyms in english or a
category of words,

73
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,013
for example,
gut from english got or have got this 

74
00:04:32,561 --> 00:04:35,460
means to have or to possess.
in top pc,

75
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:39,610
there's just this one word from english 
clothes.

76
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:44,110
This means clothes but also blouse or 
dress us.

77
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,190
This means angry or annoyed or cross in 
english.

78
00:04:48,191 --> 00:04:52,720
Cross means mildly annoyed and many 
north americans might be unfamiliar with

79
00:04:52,721 --> 00:04:54,480
that word,
but in top pc,

80
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:57,730
it's the common word for all dEgrees of 
anger or annoyance.

81
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:01,240
Two months from english,
too much.

82
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:05,050
This means very or very much or greatly 
or too much,

83
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:07,383
and some words have expanded beyond 
synonyms to cover a wider range of 

84
00:05:10,361 --> 00:05:13,420
meanings.
Stump from english stop.

85
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,750
This means to be located somewhere,
to remain,

86
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,673
to stay,
to rest or to be in progress with this 

87
00:05:21,401 --> 00:05:21,640
word.

88
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,800
It might be a bit harder to wrap your 
head around.

89
00:05:23,801 --> 00:05:27,160
It's different meanings.
If you stop somewhere than you are there

90
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:29,110
at that place,
you are remaining there.

91
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,450
You are staying there.
You are situated there.

92
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,493
The meaning of to be in progress stems 
from the meaning of remaining because 

93
00:05:35,831 --> 00:05:38,770
the action is remaining in progress.
For example,

94
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:41,380
penn belong me.
Stop long one.

95
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:47,130
This means where is my pen?
Pen of me is located at what place?

96
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,820
Novel talk pc in vocabulary.
It comes from english.

97
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:56,050
Some words come from german.
Since Samoa was under german control and

98
00:05:56,051 --> 00:05:58,250
parts of new Guinea.
We're under german control.

99
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,200
When new gideons returned,
well see,

100
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:06,190
this means to remove or to get rid of.
This comes from german warehouse,

101
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,990
meaning out.
Cool.

102
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,833
meet.
This means rubber and comes from the 

103
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:11,850
german word,
gloomy,

104
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,570
musky.
This means it doesn't matter.

105
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:19,410
It comes from the german mcneese,
which means the same thing.

106
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,500
Some vocabulary comes from malaya 
because of contact with bahasa,

107
00:06:23,501 --> 00:06:24,334
Indonesia on the island of new Guinea 
and contact with regional melia 

108
00:06:27,131 --> 00:06:30,140
languages,
so soup meaning milk.

109
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:31,303
This comes from the malaysian word susu.
Some words also come from portuguese 

110
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:40,550
because of early portuguese contact with
melanesia as early as the 16th century,

111
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:44,300
for example.
This means to know,

112
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:46,310
to understand,
to know how to,

113
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:50,030
to be able to,
to be cognizant with or to be accustomed

114
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,190
to.
This comes from portuguese,

115
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:55,490
so bad,
which means to know vicky,

116
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:59,520
which means child or baby comes from 
portuguese pecking,

117
00:06:59,521 --> 00:07:01,150
you know,
which means little,

118
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:04,610
and there are also words for many 
austronesian languages.

119
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:08,850
Grammar.
While The vocabulary of top pc in mainly

120
00:07:08,851 --> 00:07:09,684
comes from english,
the grammar largely reflects the 

121
00:07:11,551 --> 00:07:15,630
austronesian languages spoken by early 
pigeon speakers on the plantations.

122
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,673
Let's look at a few examples here and 
later we'll see more grammatical 

123
00:07:18,961 --> 00:07:21,810
features in context.
The predicate marker.

124
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:24,870
All third person sentences contained a 
predicate marker.

125
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:25,943
He

126
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,143
plus

127
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,830
the village doesn't have any water word 
for word.

128
00:07:30,831 --> 00:07:33,440
This sentence is village predicate 
marker.

129
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,333
No have water.
The word he tells us that what comes 

130
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:37,874
next is the predicate,
the part of the sentence telling us 

131
00:07:40,011 --> 00:07:40,844
something about the subject and normally
contains a verb in the language with a 

132
00:07:43,971 --> 00:07:44,804
simple vocabulary and grammar.
it would be easy to hear the predicate 

133
00:07:47,511 --> 00:07:51,530
as part of the subject if there were no 
predicate marker place.

134
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:56,010
Noga water could be understood as the 
village that doesn't have any water,

135
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,083
which would leave the listener waiting 
for a predicate to follow because that 

136
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:03,150
whole phrase sounds like the subject.
Next,

137
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:07,200
the transitive verb marker.
Iem when verbs are transitive,

138
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:09,720
in other words,
when they are followed by an object,

139
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,550
the suffix him is attached

140
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,630
me like in two months.

141
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:18,840
This means I really liked beer.
I like really beer.

142
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:23,570
Liking consists of like from english,
like with the transitive suffix,

143
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:28,610
him.
This means yesterday.

144
00:08:28,921 --> 00:08:29,754
I saw you on the street yesterday.
I see you on street looking consists of 

145
00:08:34,641 --> 00:08:37,490
look from english,
look with the transitive suffix.

146
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,353
Him.
The sentence also contains an 

147
00:08:39,951 --> 00:08:43,460
interesting word long,
which brings me to the next point.

148
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,473
Prepositions talk.
Pissing basically has two main 

149
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:48,830
prepositions.
One of them is long,

150
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:49,933
which comes from english along.
It's used to cover a wide range of 

151
00:08:52,611 --> 00:08:57,611
english prepositions in by on with from 
to and have a look at this Example

152
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:02,930
all long monday,
lonely.

153
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,063
This means they went by road on monday 
to lay they preposition marker go by 

154
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:13,250
road on monday to lay.
That's the name of a city.

155
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,383
The word old comes from english all but 
one of its uses is the third person 

156
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:21,910
plural pronoun.
The other main preposition is belong,

157
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,800
which comes from english,
belong.

158
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:28,840
It covers the meanings of and for and is
often used to indicate possession.

159
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,033
For example,

160
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:32,190
this fella emmy,

161
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,633
this is my brother's car,
this predicate marker car of brother of 

162
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:41,430
me.
Next,

163
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,353
the adjective marker paler.
The suffix pillar is normally added to 

164
00:09:45,361 --> 00:09:48,270
single syllable adjectives when they 
appear before nouns,

165
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:53,170
so a big tree is the law comes from 
english big,

166
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,630
and then the adjective suffix is 
attached to it.

167
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:58,780
[inaudible] is a word from one of 
[inaudible] austronesian,

168
00:09:58,790 --> 00:09:59,623
substratum languages.
It's also worth pointing out that this 

169
00:10:01,841 --> 00:10:02,674
phrase has no indefinite article talk.
Pc has no definite article and know 

170
00:10:06,011 --> 00:10:07,750
indefinite article.
In other words,

171
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:11,080
no equivalent of the or,
but for Clarity,

172
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:14,830
one pillar meaning one can be used.
So this phrase could be

173
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,753
one pillar,

174
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:17,853
one big tree.
Notice that one pillar comes from the 

175
00:10:20,051 --> 00:10:20,884
english word,
one with the adjective suffix attached 

176
00:10:23,021 --> 00:10:25,020
to it.
Okay.

177
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:28,050
We've seen some of its key features,
so let's look at a couple more.

178
00:10:28,051 --> 00:10:30,060
Talk pc and samples and break them down.

179
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:37,040
got enough money long by him.
House can walk him house tussle.

180
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,990
This means if we don't have enough money
to buy a house,

181
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:47,020
we can just build a house word for word.
It's if we know have enough money to buy

182
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,550
house,
we can build house.

183
00:10:49,551 --> 00:10:54,551
Just suPpose comes from english suppose 
and is used to mean if me.

184
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,520
Pella comes from english me,
which on its own would mean I,

185
00:10:58,670 --> 00:10:59,503
but the suffix pillar indicates that 
it's the plural form we belong is used 

186
00:11:03,711 --> 00:11:04,544
here to mean for by him,
comes from english by and has the 

187
00:11:07,461 --> 00:11:08,780
transitive verb.
Suffix,

means to make build or repair.

189
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,970
Tussle means just or only it comes from 
english.

190
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,950
That's all.
And one more example,

191
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,180
and maybe know go through long syncing.

192
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,213
This means he got really drunk at the 
party or she got really drunk at the 

193
00:11:27,641 --> 00:11:31,510
party he or she predicate marker,
past tense marker,

194
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,980
be drunk,
badly,

195
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:38,010
really at party m comes from english,
him but is used for both male and female

196
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:39,723
and for subjects and objects in the sin 
been comes from english being and is 

197
00:11:43,901 --> 00:11:44,734
used as an aspect marker to show 
completion of an action effectively 

198
00:11:47,831 --> 00:11:49,780
indicating past tense.
In this sentence,

199
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,680

spark and means to be drunk.

200

202
00:12:00,661 --> 00:12:05,661
adverb like truly or really long refers 
to the location of the action and sing.

203
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:06,724
Sing is a reduplicate [inaudible] of the
english word sing and is used to mean 

204
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:10,563
sing or song,
but also for a ceremony involving 

205
00:12:13,271 --> 00:12:15,430
dancing and singing or for a party.

206
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,100
Let's think about being again for a 
minute.

207
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:22,840
Talk piecing verbs are basically not 
conjugated and the verb form is the same

208
00:12:22,841 --> 00:12:26,380
for all persons and numbers and times to
indicate time.

209
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:30,680
you can use a time word like us day,
meaning yesterday to moda,

210
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:31,743
etc.
Or you can use an auxiliary verb that 

211
00:12:33,491 --> 00:12:36,550
shows aspect like being which shows 
completion.

212
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,650
Another option is to place penis from 
english,

213
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,513
finish after the verb for the future you
can use like which has the sense of is 

214
00:12:45,161 --> 00:12:47,800
about to for things a little farther in 
the future.

215
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:51,220
you can use the word bi or buying by.
For example,

216
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:52,143
by me come back,
I shall return by and buying bite come 

217
00:12:55,961 --> 00:12:56,794
from the old fashioned english 
expression by and by meaning after a 

218
00:12:59,981 --> 00:13:00,814
short time.
These words indicating an actions 

219
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,830
relation to time or not normally 
necessary.

220
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:09,460
If the time is clear from the context 
and the adverbs of the sentence,

221
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,320
hopefully this video and the language 
samples within it have given you an idea

222
00:13:14,321 --> 00:13:15,970
of what the seen is like.

223
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:19,270
The english roots of much of its 
vocabulary are obvious,

224
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:22,420
but it's also obvious that talk present 
is not english.

225
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:23,423
It's grammar is very different and even 
the vocabulary is generally used quite 

226
00:13:26,861 --> 00:13:27,694
differently.
Talk be seen as a language in its own 

227
00:13:29,621 --> 00:13:30,454
right.
It's used in the parliament of papa new 

228
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,720
Guinea,
it's used in tv and radio broadcasts and

229
00:13:34,721 --> 00:13:38,350
it's used by people all over the country
every day as a lingua franca.

230
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:39,453
there are books written and talk,
but it's still not widely used as a 

231
00:13:42,371 --> 00:13:43,204
literary language,
but there are people who think it can 

232
00:13:45,071 --> 00:13:47,050
and should fulfill that function as 
well,

233
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:51,160
but with english also being an official 
language and the language of schooling,

234
00:13:51,161 --> 00:13:51,994
some field that english should retain 
this role as the formal and literary 

235
00:13:55,031 --> 00:13:55,864
language.
The question of the day to native 

236
00:13:57,641 --> 00:14:00,850
speakers have talked piece in.
For some people it's hard to imagine how

237
00:14:00,851 --> 00:14:04,210
talk pcns vocabulary is sufficient for 
all parts of life.

238
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,253
Do you find that talk?
Pacino is sufficient to say everything 

239
00:14:07,091 --> 00:14:07,924
you want to say.
Are there times when it's not and for 

240
00:14:10,211 --> 00:14:11,044

244
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:24,730
Does it sound like english?
