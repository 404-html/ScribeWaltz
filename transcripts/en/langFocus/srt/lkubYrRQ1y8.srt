Hello everyone,
welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and 

2
00:00:02,931 --> 00:00:06,210
my name is Paul today.
This is just a quick video to talk about

3
00:00:06,211 --> 00:00:07,044
an interesting linguistic phenomenon,
something that might come up in some of 

4
00:00:09,781 --> 00:00:14,070
my videos in the future and that is the 
topic of language isolates.

5
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:15,143
Often when I talk about languages,
I talk about the family that language 

6
00:00:17,941 --> 00:00:21,600
belongs to and how it's related to other
languages in that family.

7
00:00:21,601 --> 00:00:22,434
For example,
Hebrew and Arabic are sister languages 

8
00:00:24,751 --> 00:00:25,584
of the Semitic language family,
French and Italian are sister languages 

9
00:00:28,801 --> 00:00:29,634
of the romance language family,
but did you know that there are some 

10
00:00:32,101 --> 00:00:34,740
languages that have no family 
whatsoever.

11
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,030
Those are called language isolates.
A language isolate as far as we know,

12
00:00:39,031 --> 00:00:42,240
has no genetic relationship with any 
other language.

13
00:00:42,241 --> 00:00:43,074
That means that it does not descend from
the same ancestor language as any other 

14
00:00:46,681 --> 00:00:47,514
language that we know of.
They are basically a language family 

15
00:00:50,101 --> 00:00:51,570
with only one member.

16
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,553
Some commonly known language isolates 
are the Basque language which is spoken 

17
00:00:55,591 --> 00:00:59,730
in parts of France and Spain.
Also the new language which is spoken in

18
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:02,610
Hokkaido and northern Japan.
Some people say Korean,

19
00:01:02,611 --> 00:01:03,444
although that one is disputed and also 
some native American languages as well 

20
00:01:07,051 --> 00:01:09,450
as some languages on the island of New 
Guinea.

21
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:10,403
New Guinea happens to be the most 
linguistically diverse place on the 

22
00:01:12,661 --> 00:01:14,280
planet.
If you want to know more about it,

23
00:01:14,281 --> 00:01:18,170
check out this video right here.
Why are there language isolates?

24
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:19,043
Well,
one possible reason is that that 

25
00:01:20,341 --> 00:01:23,940
language used to belong to a family that
had numerous languages in it,

26
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:24,983
but that one particular language became 
dominant and replaced all of the others 

27
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:30,623
or maybe all the other languages in that
family were replaced by a different 

28
00:01:33,781 --> 00:01:34,860
language.
For example,

29
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:38,760
a language of a conquering army,
but one particular group refused to give

30
00:01:38,761 --> 00:01:41,430
up and their language became a language 
isolate.

31
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:42,463
It is possible for a new language 
isolate to arise if that community of 

32
00:01:45,901 --> 00:01:46,734
people is completely separated,
completely isolated from other 

33
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:51,780
languages.
That's because children have the ability

34
00:01:51,781 --> 00:01:55,590
to spontaneously create new language in 
these modern times.

35
00:01:55,591 --> 00:01:58,230
That happens most often with sign 
languages.

36
00:01:58,231 --> 00:01:59,064
There have been numerous cases around 
the world of children in deaf schools 

37
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:02,693
spontaneously creating new sign 
languages that are completely unrelated 

38
00:02:05,761 --> 00:02:07,110
to any others.
In the world,

39
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,003
some linguists say that if you took a 
group of infants and you raised them in 

40
00:02:10,711 --> 00:02:11,544
an environment with no language,
that they would spontaneously create 

41
00:02:14,011 --> 00:02:14,844
their own language isolate.
This is just a quick video to introduce 

42
00:02:17,311 --> 00:02:18,144
that linguistic concept that some people
have been talking about in response to 

43
00:02:20,971 --> 00:02:24,480
some of my videos in particular,
the one about Japanese and Korean.

44
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,850
If you have any comments about this 
topic,

45
00:02:26,851 --> 00:02:30,120
leave them down below,
but stay tuned for another feature video

46
00:02:30,121 --> 00:02:32,070
coming soon.
Thank you for watching.

47
00:02:32,071 --> 00:02:32,990
Have a nice.
