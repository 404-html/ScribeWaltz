Hello everyone.
Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and 

3
00:00:07,171 --> 00:00:08,004
my name is PLA.
Today I want to look at a linguistic 

4
00:00:10,591 --> 00:00:14,070
phenomenon that I find interesting.
It's called metathesis.

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,083
The word metathesis comes from the Greek
word may talk disease meaning change of 

6
00:00:18,721 --> 00:00:19,554
position or transposition.
It refers to a situation in which 

7
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:25,260
adjacent sounds change position in a 
word.

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,273
For example,
in English we have ask but you might 

9
00:00:28,351 --> 00:00:32,790
have also heard acts in some dialects.
You can see that the two consonants have

10
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:35,370
switched places.
Another example from English,

11
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:40,040
we have the word asterisk which refers 
to this little star looking symbol away,

12
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,430
not that one.
This one.

13
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,730
Some people pronounce it as Asterix.
Another one,

14
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:50,150
the prefix intro or intra is often 
pronounced like inter for example,

15
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,083
introduce is sometimes pronounced 
introduce so you can see that the r 

16
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:57,060
sound and the vowel have become 
reversed.

17
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,133
Another one,
the prefix pre or pro is often 

18
00:01:00,571 --> 00:01:05,250
pronounced like per for example,
prescription becomes prescription.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,833
We can see examples of metathesis of 
side-by-sides sound switching positions 

20
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,270
in many different languages.
In.

21
00:01:12,271 --> 00:01:14,100
What kinds of situations does this 
happen?

22
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,350
Well,
during the development of a language,

23
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,570
there's sometimes a change.
For example,

24
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:20,190
the English word bird came from.
