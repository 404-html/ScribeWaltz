1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,313
Hmm.

2
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:15,823
Hello everyone.
Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and 

3
00:00:17,451 --> 00:00:18,950
my name is Paul.
Yes,

4
00:00:18,951 --> 00:00:19,784
that's right.
Today the focus channel has reached 

5
00:00:21,471 --> 00:00:23,000
50,000
subscribers.

6
00:00:23,001 --> 00:00:25,580
This is a big day for me.
When I started my channel,

7
00:00:25,581 --> 00:00:28,880
I always had the dream in mind,
the goal in mind of reaching 50,000

8
00:00:28,881 --> 00:00:29,714
subscribers,
and I thought that was kind of the 

9
00:00:30,921 --> 00:00:31,754
pinnacle.
Now it seems like that's an achievable 

10
00:00:33,351 --> 00:00:36,560
goal and we'll see how much further I 
can get them $50,000,

11
00:00:36,561 --> 00:00:39,830
but for now I've achieved my initial 
goal and that's really great.

12
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:42,800
Really exciting for me.
So thank you for all of your support.

13
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:44,053
So onto today's topic imagined that 
there was a mysterious language in 

14
00:00:49,251 --> 00:00:50,084
Europe that was surrounded on all sides 
by languages that it had absolutely no 

15
00:00:53,631 --> 00:00:56,810
connection with wealth.
Directionally is a language like that.

16
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:59,120
The language is the Basque language.

17
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,213
Basque is a language isolate,
meaning that it has no known connection 

18
00:01:05,071 --> 00:01:07,560
to any other language.
It's located in Europe,

19
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:11,520
but it's not an Indo European language.
It forms its own language.

20
00:01:11,521 --> 00:01:12,354
Family ended is quite distinct,
very different from Indo European 

21
00:01:14,851 --> 00:01:17,520
languages.
It is spoken by the basket people in the

22
00:01:17,521 --> 00:01:20,010
Basque country or region that spans the 
Spain,

23
00:01:20,011 --> 00:01:22,680
France border in the Western most 
Pyrenees mountains.

24
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:24,883
It is not spoken by all Basques,
but by around 27 percent of them in the 

25
00:01:27,961 --> 00:01:29,160
basket country.
Overall,

26
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,310
the number of native speakers is 
714,000,

27
00:01:32,311 --> 00:01:35,580
135 out of a total population of 2 
million,

28
00:01:35,581 --> 00:01:40,581
648,998,
and that includes about 663,000

29
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:44,100
on the Spanish side and 51,100
on the French side.

30
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:47,010
It is an official language at the 
regional level in Spain,

31
00:01:47,011 --> 00:01:49,840
in the basket,
autonomous community and in I've already

32
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,160
in France,
it holds no official status.

33
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:56,820
The origins of the Basque language are 
shrouded in mystery.

34
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,160
As I said before,
it is a language isolate.

35
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,173
It is thought to be the last remaining 
language that existed in Europe before 

36
00:02:03,121 --> 00:02:05,310
the arrival of the Indo European 
languages.

37
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:09,933
There is conclusive evidence that basket
is a descendant of the aqua tanium 

38
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:13,624
language,
which is an ancient language spoken in 

39
00:02:14,921 --> 00:02:15,754
the Pyrenees region.
Some similarities are known between 

40
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,020
Aquitania and the ancient Iberian 
language,

41
00:02:20,021 --> 00:02:22,300
so some people think that they might be 
related,

42
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:23,253
but those similarities might just be due
to geographic proximity and mutual 

43
00:02:26,261 --> 00:02:28,060
influence.
We don't know.

44
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:28,923
Some linguists suggests that Aqua Tinian
was part of a wider language family 

45
00:02:31,811 --> 00:02:32,644
called the vest chronic languages which 
covered most of Europe before the 

46
00:02:35,201 --> 00:02:37,900
arrival of the Indo European languages,
but again,

47
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:40,900
we don't know other people draw 
connection between baskin,

48
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:44,200
other non into European languages like 
the Caucasian languages,

49
00:02:44,201 --> 00:02:45,034
but again,

50
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,970
that's right.
We don't know.

51
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:48,953
One thing we do know is that the Basque 
people who descend mostly from farmers 

52
00:02:52,141 --> 00:02:56,520
who arrived in the area around 6,000
years ago were isolated from the outside

53
00:02:56,521 --> 00:02:57,354
world for thousands of years.
That's probably partly of the best 

54
00:02:59,921 --> 00:03:00,754
countries,
forested mountain terrain and it's lack 

55
00:03:02,801 --> 00:03:05,320
of tempting resources that prevented 
invasion.

56
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:06,363
This isolation is probably what allowed 
their language to survive and develop 

57
00:03:09,521 --> 00:03:11,770
into the Basque language of today.
Of course,

58
00:03:11,771 --> 00:03:12,604
there were Latin borrowings into the 
language and there have been other 

59
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:16,930
romance language borrowings throughout 
the centuries,

60
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:17,943
but nothing like the total disappearance
of other pre Latin languages in that 

61
00:03:20,831 --> 00:03:21,664
area.
Basketball's a unified language until 

62
00:03:23,141 --> 00:03:23,974
the Middle Ages,
when it began to diverge into dialects 

63
00:03:26,021 --> 00:03:29,620
because of administrative and political 
divisions within the Basque country,

64
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:33,040
despite being ruled by outside regimes 
throughout the centuries,

65
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:33,874
the best country still remained isolated
and relatively uninfluenced by the 

66
00:03:37,421 --> 00:03:39,520
outside world,
and that includes the language.

67
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,480
But when Francisco Franco became ruler 
of Spain in 1939,

68
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:44,583
the use of Basque was heavily suppressed
because Franco wanted to assimilate all 

69
00:03:47,771 --> 00:03:52,000
of Spain into castilian culture.
It was forbidden to speak baskin schools

70
00:03:52,001 --> 00:03:52,834
and to public.
It was banned from media and removed 

71
00:03:54,641 --> 00:03:55,474
from public services.
This led to a big reduction in the 

72
00:03:57,401 --> 00:03:59,590
number of people who could speak the 
Basque language,

73
00:03:59,591 --> 00:04:00,424
and that's part of the reason that only 
27 percent of people in the Basque 

74
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:04,780
country speak the language.
Today.

75
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,793
In the 19 sixties that suppression was 
eased somewhat and Basque language 

76
00:04:08,591 --> 00:04:09,424
schools became permitted and the 
language begin being used in 

77
00:04:11,681 --> 00:04:13,720
publications and in education.
Again,

78
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,400
this led to the creation of a 
standardized language called [inaudible]

79
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:18,303
about [inaudible].
It was developed by the Basque Language 

80
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,990
Academy or the Scouts and the uh,
and it was intended to be comprehensible

81
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,260
to speakers of the various dialects of 
basket.

82
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:30,590
There are five main basket dialects be 
Skyann or western basket,

83
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,530
keep Fusco on or central Basque.

84
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,280
Upper Novari's,
Novari's,

85
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,520
Freudian,
and the town in France.

86
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,223
These dialects correspond with the 
historic provinces of the Basque 

87
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,313
country,
but they don't completely correspond 

88
00:04:42,431 --> 00:04:43,264
with the modern provinces of today.
The level of intelligibility depends on 

89
00:04:46,571 --> 00:04:47,404
the distance between those two dialects 
on the dialect continuum with the most 

90
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:52,900
distant dialects,
having trouble understanding each other,

91
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:55,720
but that's where the standard language 
use got about two or comes in.

92
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:58,060
So what is the Basque language like?
Well,

93
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:58,953
it's vocabulary has been influenced by 
the surrounding romance languages to 

94
00:05:01,571 --> 00:05:03,490
some extent,
but when you look at it structure,

95
00:05:03,491 --> 00:05:04,324
you will see that it is unlike any 
romance language or like any Indo 

96
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:08,980
European language for that matter,
bass,

97
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:11,800
Kaz grammatical cases,
12 cases to be exact,

98
00:05:11,801 --> 00:05:14,740
but that is not really unusual in Indo 
European languages,

99
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,260
but it has something called the 
[inaudible] case.

100
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,183
That means that there's a special form 
of the noun when it's the subject of a 

101
00:05:20,471 --> 00:05:22,750
sentence and it takes a transitive verb.

102
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,950
That means it has a direct object.
This ergotism case is marked with a k at

103
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:28,060
the end of the known.
Now,

104
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:28,894
along with the [inaudible] case,
there is also something called the 

105
00:05:30,641 --> 00:05:31,474
absolute of case.
This is for subjects of intransitive 

106
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:35,980
verbs,
meaning that it has no direct object,

107
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,230
and in this case there was no ending on 
the end of the.

108
00:05:38,231 --> 00:05:38,891
Now,
well,

109
00:05:38,891 --> 00:05:40,750
let's take a look at a couple of 
sentences.

110
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:41,950
Who America?
Leanne,

111
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:47,020
that means the child fell in the street.
But if we look at it word by word,

112
00:05:47,021 --> 00:05:49,960
you can see the interesting structure of
Basque word by word.

113
00:05:49,961 --> 00:05:50,794
It's child the street.
The in fall is if we look at the first 

114
00:05:55,331 --> 00:05:57,070
word there,
who may his child,

115
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,930
but then the definite article is the a 
at the end.

116
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:00,943
Then for the next word,
Kellyanne Conway is street and then the 

117
00:06:03,171 --> 00:06:06,260
definite article is up and then in the 
end,

118
00:06:06,261 --> 00:06:08,360
at the end of the word,
if we look at the next word,

119
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:09,500
God,
that's a verb,

120
00:06:09,501 --> 00:06:11,840
meaning fall,
but it's in the perfect aspect.

121
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,800
That means that it shows a completed 
action and then the auxiliary verb comes

122
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:19,820
after the main verb at the end and this 
one means is it's the present tense form

123
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,890
of to be.
And another sentence,

124
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:26,930
Maddie,
that means the man has given the book to

125
00:06:26,931 --> 00:06:29,480
the child,
so word by word man,

126
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:34,430
the [inaudible] case child,
the data of case book,

127
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:37,590
the given has.
The first word is Gisele knuck.

128
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:38,763
The zone is man than the definite 
article is a and then the negative case 

129
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:45,080
is k Lumiata.
That's child again,

130
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:45,943
child is meant and then this time it has
the definite article a and then it has 

131
00:06:49,491 --> 00:06:51,860
the date of case marker.
The at the end,

132
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:55,610
the date of case basically shows who or 
what is being affected by the action,

133
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,540
the next word,
the Buddha,

134
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,630
the Buddha to his book,
and then as the definite article,

135
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:02,450
and this one looks like a lone word from
a romance language.

136
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,313
The next one a month is a verb and it's 
in the perfect aspect showing that the 

137
00:07:06,111 --> 00:07:10,250
action is completed and then the 
auxiliary verb deal comes after and that

138
00:07:10,251 --> 00:07:14,630
means has and the next sentence in my 
view,

139
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:16,003
that means the woman has seen the memo,
so word by word woman the or gets IV 

140
00:07:19,821 --> 00:07:20,654
case man is a scene has.
So the first word in Morocco may act in 

141
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:29,170
macrame is woman.
That is the A and ergonomic cases.

142
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,250
TheK ,
the next word [inaudible].

143
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:33,560
That's the man and the definite article.
Again,

144
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:35,990
the next word is [inaudible],
which means scene and again,

145
00:07:35,991 --> 00:07:36,824
that's a verb with the perfect aspect,
showing the actions completed and then 

146
00:07:39,561 --> 00:07:42,620
the auxiliary verb comes at the end and 
it means has,

147
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:44,323
as you can see,
the Basque language is very different 

148
00:07:45,891 --> 00:07:46,724
from any Indo European language.
Very different from any language that 

149
00:07:48,951 --> 00:07:49,784
I've studied,
but it also looks quite logical and 

150
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:52,604
systematic.

151
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:53,443
It would be a shame to lose a language 
that's so unique and that connects us 

152
00:07:55,971 --> 00:07:56,804
with the ancient history of Europe.
The number of Basque speakers has 

153
00:07:59,631 --> 00:08:03,830
sharply declined over the last century,
but there are efforts in Spain to revive

154
00:08:03,831 --> 00:08:04,664
the language and to make it more 
widespread again and hopefully such 

155
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:10,790
efforts will continue and become more 
prominent in France as well.

156
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,010
Thank you for watching the length focus 
channel.

157
00:08:13,011 --> 00:08:15,770
I want to say thanks again to all of my 
patreon supporters.

158
00:08:15,771 --> 00:08:17,690
You guys are awesome.
I appreciate you.

159
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:18,613
Thanks to all those other people who 
volunteered in different ways by 

160
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:21,523
creating subtitles for videos or 
offering to write some scripts for Geo 

161
00:08:24,411 --> 00:08:27,750
focused or all of those things.
Also be sure to check out the line focus

162
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:28,603
facebook account,
a twitter account and instagram because 

163
00:08:30,321 --> 00:08:31,154
I'm often on there and that's a way to 
keep in touch and always know when I 

164
00:08:33,831 --> 00:08:34,664
have new content being released.
Thank you for watching and have a nice 

165
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:38,653
day.
