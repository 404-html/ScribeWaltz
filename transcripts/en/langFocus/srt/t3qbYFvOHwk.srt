Hello everyone.
Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel at.

2
00:00:03,421 --> 00:00:07,380
My name is Paul.
Today's topic is language death.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,200
Normally on this channel,
when I talk about a language,

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:11,063
it's usually a living language,
a language that still spoken by native 

5
00:00:13,921 --> 00:00:17,070
speakers today and continues to grow and
evolve,

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:20,760
but there are also dead languages and 
extinct languages.

7
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,840
Languages are considered dead when they 
simply have no more native speakers,

8
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,510
even though they may continue to be used
in some way.

9
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:29,490
Latin is dead,
for example,

10
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,353
but it continues to be used for 
religious purposes and for some 

11
00:00:32,581 --> 00:00:33,414
administrative purposes in the Vatican.
Some people can speak it but not 

12
00:00:37,531 --> 00:00:38,364
naturally like a native language and 
it's not passed down as a native 

13
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,470
language.
Another example is Hebrew,

14
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,550
which was a dead language before its 
revival in the form of modern Hebrew.

15
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:50,310
Nobody spoke it natively for a long 
time,

16
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,173
but it continued to be used for 
religious purposes and as a written 

17
00:00:53,881 --> 00:00:54,990
literary language.

18
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:58,500
In contrast,
languages are considered extinct when no

19
00:00:58,501 --> 00:01:01,020
living person can speak them.
For example,

20
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:05,190
if the last remaining speaker of a 
native American language dies and nobody

21
00:01:05,191 --> 00:01:08,850
has learned it as a second language than
that language becomes extinct.

22
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:09,893
Likewise,
ancient languages like Sumerian are 

23
00:01:11,791 --> 00:01:12,624
extinct.
Some people might be able to read 

24
00:01:14,131 --> 00:01:17,430
ancient texts in that language,
but nobody really uses it today.

25
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,450
Languages become either dead or extinct 
as a result of language,

26
00:01:21,451 --> 00:01:23,940
death types of language.
Death.

27
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,730
Languages don't always die in the same 
way.

28
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,830
There are various types of language 
death.

29
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:29,993
The most common way that languages 
disappear is through gradual language 

30
00:01:32,791 --> 00:01:35,190
death.
This normally happens when speakers have

31
00:01:35,191 --> 00:01:39,000
one language come into contact with a 
language of higher prestige,

32
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,820
the language of a dominant more powerful
group of people.

33
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,030
That community may remain bilingual for 
quite a long time,

34
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:45,893
but with each successive generation,
fewer young people speak their 

35
00:01:48,331 --> 00:01:52,680
traditional language and with lower 
levels of proficiency as they opt to use

36
00:01:52,681 --> 00:01:56,160
the prestige language instead until one 
day their communities.

37
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,200
Traditional language is no longer 
spoken.

38
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,213
An example of this as corniche,
which seems to be spoken by the late 

39
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:02,573
19th century as a result of the growing 
influence of English and also as a 

40
00:02:06,241 --> 00:02:09,420
result of the perception of Cornish as a
lower class language,

41
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,400
even amongst it's own speakers at the 
time,

42
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:16,170
but cornish is actually not extinct 
because there are revitalization efforts

43
00:02:16,171 --> 00:02:17,004
to encourage people to continue to use 
that language next bottom to top 

44
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:23,370
language death in bottom to top language
death.

45
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:26,580
A language ceases to be used as a native
spoken language,

46
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:29,430
but continues to be used in certain 
contexts.

47
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:30,323
Normally in a formal religious context 
or ceremonial context or perhaps for 

48
00:02:34,081 --> 00:02:37,410
literary purposes.
In gradual language death,

49
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:41,790
the language normally disappears first 
in more formal contexts as it's replaced

50
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:42,624
by the prestige language,
but it continues to be spoken in more 

51
00:02:44,971 --> 00:02:49,140
casual contexts for a longer time in 
bottom to top language deaths.

52
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,750
On the other hand,
the language dies out at the bottom,

53
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,850
in other words,
in casual contexts,

54
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,700
but it continues to be used in more 
formal contexts.

55
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,433
An example of this is Latin,
which is basically no longer used 

56
00:03:00,761 --> 00:03:05,080
outside of religious ceremonial contexts
or perhaps literary contexts.

57
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:07,750
Next,
southern language death.

58
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:12,370
Southern language death occurs when all 
or almost all the speakers of a language

59
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,820
suddenly die as a result of a disaster 
or violence.

60
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,073
An example of this took place in the 18 
thirties in Tasmania when virtually all 

61
00:03:20,531 --> 00:03:21,364
of the islands native inhabitants were 
wiped out by European colonists during 

62
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,580
the black war.
Next,

63
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:31,270
radical language death similar to 
southern language death,

64
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:32,223
radical language death normally happens 
very rapidly and normally happens as a 

65
00:03:35,711 --> 00:03:38,950
result of political repression or under 
threat of violence.

66
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:42,550
The difference is that the language has 
speakers are not wiped out,

67
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:46,660
but suddenly stop using their own 
language as a way to avoid persecution.

68
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:47,613
And example of this occurred in El 
Salvador during an uprising in the 19 

69
00:03:50,741 --> 00:03:51,574
thirties when many aboriginals abruptly 
stopped speaking their native languages 

70
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,833
as a way to avoid being identified as 
aboriginals and potentially killed two 

71
00:04:00,161 --> 00:04:05,161
languages that suddenly died out where 
Linka and case studies.

72
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,083
Let's look at a few languages that have 
already died and see if we could figure 

73
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:10,624
out how they ceased to be spoken.
Old Church slavonic old church slavonic 

74
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:18,460
is the first the tested Slavic language,
which was spoken and written between the

75
00:04:18,461 --> 00:04:19,294
ninth and 11th centuries.
It was a standardized variety of Slavic 

76
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:26,200
that was understood by speakers of the 
various Slavic dialects of that time,

77
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:28,360
which were still quite similar to each 
other,

78
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:31,810
those slavic dialects,
which were basically the colloquial form

79
00:04:31,811 --> 00:04:32,644
of the same language,
gradually developed into the different 

80
00:04:34,661 --> 00:04:35,494
Slavic languages of today because it's 
still used in some churches for 

81
00:04:39,011 --> 00:04:41,860
religious purposes today,
it's a liturgical language,

82
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,850
so it fits in with the category of 
bottom to top language death.

83
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:47,043
The newly developing Slavic languages 
replaced the old slavonic dialects as 

84
00:04:50,441 --> 00:04:51,274
the languages of daily life,
but old church slavonic continued to be 

85
00:04:53,891 --> 00:04:54,724
used for religious purposes and for a 
certain amount of time for political 

86
00:04:57,941 --> 00:04:58,774
purposes.
It's worth noting that some dead 

87
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:05,230
languages never actually died in both 
the case of Latin and of old slavonic.

88
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:06,123
The language never stopped being spoken.
It just continued to evolve into 

89
00:05:09,011 --> 00:05:09,844
different languages.
Leaving the cotified literary language 

90
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:15,310
behind as a separate dead language that 
was no longer spoken,

91
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:20,760
the men then language in 2016,
a man named Edwin Benson,

92
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:24,160
the last remaining speaker of the men.
Then language passed away.

93
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:25,203
Men.
Dan was a native American language of 

94
00:05:26,471 --> 00:05:27,304
the Sewan language family,
which was spoken in the state of North 

95
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,600
Dakota.
The population of men,

96
00:05:31,601 --> 00:05:32,434
Dan speakers,
was nearly wiped out by an outbreak of 

97
00:05:34,451 --> 00:05:38,020
smallpox in the seventies and eighties 
and again in the 18 thirties.

98
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:42,700
The cohesion of the remaining population
was limited by government relocation and

99
00:05:42,701 --> 00:05:46,060
the construction of dams which separated
villages from each other.

100
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,170
While the influence of English group,
the fact that most of the population was

101
00:05:50,171 --> 00:05:51,004
wiped out in tragic outbreaks of 
smallpox would place this in the 

102
00:05:53,801 --> 00:05:54,634
category of southern language death.
Even though some speakers of the 

103
00:05:57,231 --> 00:06:00,440
language continued to live on among the 
remaining speakers,

104
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:03,860
we can also say that there was an 
element of gradual language death.

105
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:04,783
As more and more members of that 
community began to speak the prestige 

106
00:06:07,191 --> 00:06:08,024
language English until one day,
men then was no longer spoken ghoulish 

107
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:12,763
up until the sixth century seat.
A Celtic language called galesh was 

108
00:06:15,861 --> 00:06:19,280
spoken in what's now France when the 
Romans conquered the area,

109
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:20,203
they made Latin the official language of
the state and being able to speak Latin 

110
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,010
became a way to gain status and economic
opportunity for a number of centuries.

111
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:28,903
It was common to be bilingual and golish
vernacular and the prestige language 

112
00:06:32,031 --> 00:06:35,210
Latin until Latin finally replaced 
golish entirely.

113
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,433
This is a clear case of gradual language
death as a population gradually gave up 

114
00:06:40,011 --> 00:06:42,980
their traditional language in favor of 
the prestige language.

115
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,360
A joa between 19,
20 and 1940.

116
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:48,283
The agewell language died out in Nigeria
because it's entire community of 

117
00:06:51,591 --> 00:06:55,430
speakers switched to house up for 
economic and practical reasons.

118
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:59,540
The entire community very rapidly 
stopped using their traditional language

119
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:02,060
and it was not passed down to the next 
generation.

120
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:03,163
This is an example of radical language 
death when a language dies because all 

121
00:07:06,591 --> 00:07:09,290
of it speakers suddenly switched to 
another language.

122
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,690
In many cases of radical language,
death,

123
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:15,920
the community gives up their language 
for survival in the face of violence,

124
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:16,813
but in this particular case,
they gave up the agewell language 

125
00:07:19,101 --> 00:07:22,310
because it was more beneficial for their
community to speak Hausa.

126
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:27,440
Why should we care about language death?
Some people think that language death is

127
00:07:27,441 --> 00:07:28,274
a good thing,
that less language diversity is a good 

128
00:07:30,201 --> 00:07:31,250
thing.
For example,

129
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,113
the leaders of some countries want one 
language to be dominant and to replace 

130
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:35,954
all of the others because they think 
that will promote the unity of their 

131
00:07:38,271 --> 00:07:39,830
country.
On the other hand,

132
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:42,740
a language is part of a culture,
so when a language dies,

133
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,520
part of that culture dies and a unique 
way of seeing the world dies with it.

134
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:47,653
For example,
let's look at the endangered color wire 

135
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:50,383
language of Bolivia.
Columbia is used by a sect of medicine 

136
00:07:53,271 --> 00:07:54,104
men who learned the language not only to
understand the ritual practice and oral 

137
00:07:57,591 --> 00:07:58,424
tradition of their ancestors,
but also to understand the thousands 

138
00:08:01,011 --> 00:08:01,844
upon thousands of plant names specific 
to the callaway or language that 

139
00:08:04,761 --> 00:08:07,940
explained the medicine will uses of 
different plants in the local region.

140
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:09,043
If color disappears,
then all of that culture and secret 

141
00:08:11,421 --> 00:08:12,254
knowledge will disappear with it.
Linguistic diversity has been on a 

142
00:08:15,921 --> 00:08:18,950
steady decline and of the presence 
nearly 7,000

143
00:08:18,951 --> 00:08:19,784
languages on earth,
nearly half are endangered and the top 

144
00:08:23,061 --> 00:08:27,920
100 most spoken languages are spoken by 
85 percent of the world's population.

145
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:32,510
Some endangered languages are finding 
new life through revitalization efforts,

146
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:35,690
which require that the language first be
recorded and documented,

147
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,673
then learned by a new speakers and also 
used by an enthusiastic and motivated 

148
00:08:40,881 --> 00:08:44,300
community and having some political 
influence wouldn't hurt either.

149
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:47,720
The question of the day in your country 
or in your region,

150
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:51,440
are there languages that are in danger 
of dying or becoming extinct?

151
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,050
How would you feel about those languages
disappearing?

152
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,380
What's something important be lost?
Be sure to follow Lang,

153
00:08:57,381 --> 00:08:58,980
focus on facebook,
twitter,

154
00:08:58,981 --> 00:09:00,870
and Instagram,
and once again,

155
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,450
thank you to all of my wonderful patrion
supporters,

156
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:07,440
especially my top tier patrion 
supporters whose names are on the screen

157
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:09,660
right now.
Very many thanks to them.

158
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:12,470
By the way,
on the last video about Tokyo,

159
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:17,150
some of you asked why Toki Pona was 
listed on the page of patrons and that's

160
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:17,993
because the creator of the Tokyo 
[inaudible] language has been a patron 

161
00:09:20,401 --> 00:09:23,580
since last summer,
but preferred not to appear on the list,

162
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:24,683
but upon request,
I've begun listing the name of the 

163
00:09:26,431 --> 00:09:27,264
language instead.
Thank you for watching and have a nice 

164
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,953
day.
