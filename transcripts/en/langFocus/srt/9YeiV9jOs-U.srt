1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,043
Okay.
So I've had a lot of requests for a 

2
00:00:02,191 --> 00:00:03,024
video on the North Germanic languages.
So today I present to you a video on 

3
00:00:06,631 --> 00:00:08,130
Swedish,
Norwegian,

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,660
Danish,
and Finnish.

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:12,993
What?

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:17,953
Hello everyone.
Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and 

7
00:00:19,761 --> 00:00:20,594
my name is Paula.
Today I'm going to talk about the north 

8
00:00:22,521 --> 00:00:23,354
Germanic languages of the Nordic nations
that includes the Scandinavian 

9
00:00:26,721 --> 00:00:27,890
languages,
Swedish,

10
00:00:27,891 --> 00:00:29,240
Danish,
and Norwegian.

11
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,990
And I will also touch on the languages 
of Icelandic and federal wheeze.

12
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:34,003
I wanted to call this video at the 
Scandinavian languages because I just 

13
00:00:36,621 --> 00:00:38,900
love the way that word sounds 
Scandinavian,

14
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:39,853
but to the people of that region.
The word Scandinavian only refers to 

15
00:00:42,801 --> 00:00:43,850
Denmark,
Sweden,

16
00:00:43,851 --> 00:00:44,684
and Norway,
and not to the other countries that I 

17
00:00:46,371 --> 00:00:49,520
want to talk about.
So if I say the Nordic nations,

18
00:00:49,521 --> 00:00:52,040
that also includes Iceland,
the Faroe Islands,

19
00:00:52,041 --> 00:00:52,874
as well as Finland.
I want to talk about the north Germanic 

20
00:00:55,191 --> 00:00:57,140
languages spoken in all of those 
countries.

21
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:58,003
So I decided on the title and the North 
Germanic languages of the Nordic 

22
00:01:00,831 --> 00:01:01,664
nations.
And please note that finish is not in 

23
00:01:03,711 --> 00:01:06,800
north dramatic language.
It belongs to a separate language family

24
00:01:06,801 --> 00:01:07,634
entirely.

25
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,830
There are about 20 million native 
speakers of North Germanic languages,

26
00:01:13,831 --> 00:01:16,770
and that includes about 9 million 
speakers of Swedish,

27
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,753
mainly in Sweden,
but also as a minority language in 

28
00:01:19,651 --> 00:01:22,080
Finland.
6 million speakers of Danish,

29
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:22,943
mainly in Denmark,
but also as a minority language in the 

30
00:01:24,991 --> 00:01:28,380
southern less vague region of northern 
Germany and in Greenland,

31
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:31,050
5 million speakers of Norwegian,
mainly in Norway,

32
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,990
320,000
speakers of Icelandic,

33
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:35,940
mainly in Iceland.
90,000

34
00:01:35,941 --> 00:01:36,774
speakers of feral wheeze.
About two thirds of them living in the 

35
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,040
Faroe Islands and the rest of mainly in 
Denmark.

36
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,100
The North Germanic languages are,
as you probably guessed,

37
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,350
a branch of the dramatic language 
family.

38
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:49,620
All dramatic language is developed from 
Proto Germanic,

39
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:50,483
which was spoken around 500 bce.
Frodo Germanic possibly originated in 

40
00:01:54,451 --> 00:01:55,284
Scandinavia,
and different varieties of dramatic 

41
00:01:57,241 --> 00:01:58,074
began to emerge with migration.
Runic inscriptions from the second 

42
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:01,854
century ce show us that by that time,
pro dramatic had began to separate into 

43
00:02:05,671 --> 00:02:08,520
distinct western,
eastern and northern dialects.

44
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:09,653
The northern dialect was spoken in 
Scandinavia and is today often referred 

45
00:02:12,601 --> 00:02:13,434
to as Prato norse and became the 
ancestor of all the north Germanic 

46
00:02:16,921 --> 00:02:19,170
languages.
[inaudible] north was spoken from around

47
00:02:19,171 --> 00:02:20,004
the second century Ce to the eighth 
century ce and by the beginning of the 

48
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,043
Viking era in the eighth century ce,
it had evolved into dialects that are 

49
00:02:27,691 --> 00:02:32,070
collectively referred to as old norse.
During the next few hundred years,

50
00:02:32,071 --> 00:02:32,904
vikings seafaring norse people explored 
much of Europe by sea and river 

51
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,133
conquering lands and establishing 
settlements and bringing their language 

52
00:02:39,811 --> 00:02:41,520
with them.
During this time,

53
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,413
old north was divided into three 
mutually intelligible dialects of old 

54
00:02:45,811 --> 00:02:46,470
east,
north,

55
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,600
old west,
north and old goodness.

56
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,793
All these north was spoken in Sweden and
Denmark as well as their overseas 

57
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,513
settlements in Russia,
England and in Danish settlements in 

58
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:56,403
Normandy.
Old West North was spoken in Norway as 

59
00:02:58,771 --> 00:02:59,604
well as its overseas settlements.
The two most notable where Iceland and 

60
00:03:02,381 --> 00:03:04,540
the Faroe Islands,
but also Ireland,

61
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:05,374
Scotland,
and the isle of Man and Norwegian 

62
00:03:07,031 --> 00:03:07,864
settlements in Norman,
deep old goodness was mainly spoken on 

63
00:03:10,061 --> 00:03:13,060
the island of Gotland,
which is today part of Sweden as well as

64
00:03:13,061 --> 00:03:14,740
some overseas settlements to the east.

65
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:15,903
These west East and goodness varieties 
of old norse gradually developed into 

66
00:03:19,601 --> 00:03:23,110
the modern north Germanic languages.
Around the 14th century CE.

67
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:26,110
The Western branch of languages consists
of Norwegian,

68
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:29,860
Icelandic and Pharaoh weeds as well as 
some other extinct languages.

69
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:33,160
The eastern branch consists of Swedish 
and Danish.

70
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:36,040
The goodness branch consists of only the
good initial language,

71
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:38,830
which is still spoken to some extent on 
the island of Gotland,

72
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,023
but these days the north dramatic 
languages are generally not thought of 

73
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,260
in terms of east,
west and goodness.

74
00:03:44,261 --> 00:03:47,140
They are thought of in terms of 
continental and insular.

75
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:48,183
The continental languages are Danish,
Swedish and Norwegian and the insular 

76
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:53,500
languages.
Our Icelandic and Pharaoh ease.

77
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,513
These categories are based on the mutual
intelligibility of the languages rather 

78
00:03:57,521 --> 00:04:00,280
than on the genetic root language that 
they come from.

79
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:04,660
Norwegian is grouped with Swedish and 
Danish because even though Icelandic and

80
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,090
Norwegian developed from the same old 
west,

81
00:04:07,091 --> 00:04:11,050
North's Norwegian is today much more 
intelligible with Swedish and Danish.

82
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:16,990
One reason for that is the political 
union of Denmark and Norway from 1536 to

83
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:17,863
1814 during this time,
the written Norwegian language stopped 

84
00:04:20,651 --> 00:04:21,484
being used and it was replaced by the 
written Danish language and this had a 

85
00:04:24,401 --> 00:04:27,100
big impact on the spoken dialect of 
Norwegian,

86
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:29,620
especially the central and eastern 
dialects.

87
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:33,550
The continental languages also underwent
a lot of influence from middle,

88
00:04:33,551 --> 00:04:36,190
low German,
which is an influence that didn't effect

89
00:04:36,191 --> 00:04:37,024
Icelandic and fairways.
The three continental languages can be 

90
00:04:39,641 --> 00:04:42,040
referred to as the Scandinavian 
languages.

91
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,320
When talking about the Scandinavian 
languages,

92
00:04:44,321 --> 00:04:45,154
it's important to note that there is a 
significant amount of dialectal 

93
00:04:47,411 --> 00:04:50,170
variation within each language.
In fact,

94
00:04:50,171 --> 00:04:52,840
the three languages are made up of a 
dialect continuum.

95
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,940
That means if you travel in one 
direction,

96
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:57,610
the dialects gradually change the 
further you go.

97
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,720
That means,
for example,

98
00:04:58,721 --> 00:05:01,480
that if you are a Norwegian living near 
the border with Sweden,

99
00:05:01,481 --> 00:05:02,314
you probably have an easier time 
understanding your neighbor just across 

100
00:05:04,781 --> 00:05:05,620
the border in Sweden.

101
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:08,620
Then you do a Norwegian from the other 
side of the country.

102
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:09,663
Even though you are supposedly speaking 
a different language from that Swedish 

103
00:05:12,401 --> 00:05:13,234
person.
This makes it kind of hard to determine 

104
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:15,514
at what point these dialects become 
different languages or if they are in 

105
00:05:17,981 --> 00:05:21,400
fact different languages at all.
The three languages are all more or less

106
00:05:21,401 --> 00:05:22,234
intelligible depending on where the 
dialect lies on that continuum and the 

107
00:05:25,421 --> 00:05:28,030
written languages are almost entirely 
intelligible.

108
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,073
Danish seems to be the odd man out with 
its complex phonology that has come to 

109
00:05:32,441 --> 00:05:34,540
be quite distinct from the written 
language.

110
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:35,613
Swedes and Norwegians often say that 
Danish people sound like they're 

111
00:05:37,721 --> 00:05:38,554
speaking with a potato in their mouth.
I can't actually confirm if they do 

112
00:05:41,621 --> 00:05:44,020
speak with a potato in their mouth,
so scandinavians,

113
00:05:44,021 --> 00:05:46,570
can you let me know if that's true in 
the comments down below?

114
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,450
I have Danish roots,
so I'm allowed to make fun of Dan's from

115
00:05:49,451 --> 00:05:50,284
what I understand,
no regions have the easiest time 

116
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,460
understanding the other two Scandinavian
languages,

117
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:56,950
though they understand Swedish better 
than Danish.

118
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,470
Swedes can generally understand or 
region,

119
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,313
but they have much more trouble 
understanding Danish because of its 

120
00:06:02,481 --> 00:06:03,314
pronunciation and Danes can more or less
understand Norwegian and to a lesser 

121
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:10,220
extent they can understand some Swedish.
From what I understand,

122
00:06:10,221 --> 00:06:13,640
Scandinavians will generally not speak 
the other person's language.

123
00:06:13,641 --> 00:06:17,480
They will speak their own language while
making an effort to understand the other

124
00:06:17,481 --> 00:06:21,470
person's speech and maybe they will slow
down and clarify things when necessary,

125
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:24,290
but when they have significant trouble 
communicating,

126
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:25,124
they might switch to English,
which isn't that tough for them because 

127
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:30,770
Scandinavians are magical geniuses when 
it comes to learning English.

128
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:31,783
In this kind of situation where you have
three closely related languages that 

129
00:06:34,491 --> 00:06:35,324
kind of blend together on a continuum,
the languages are not defined by the 

130
00:06:38,391 --> 00:06:39,224
spoken variety but rather by the 
official standard language associated 

131
00:06:42,471 --> 00:06:44,660
with that country or region.
In Denmark,

132
00:06:44,661 --> 00:06:45,494
there a standard Danish.
In Sweden there is standard Swedish and 

133
00:06:48,261 --> 00:06:51,020
in Norway there is standard Norwegian or
wait,

134
00:06:51,021 --> 00:06:51,854
no,
there they're actually two standard 

135
00:06:52,761 --> 00:06:53,594
Norwegians.

136
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:54,890
Okay.

137
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:55,723
That's right.
Norway actually has two official 

138
00:06:57,231 --> 00:07:01,250
standard written languages,
bulk and Nina Osc book model,

139
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:04,970
which means book language is a Danish 
influenced standard language,

140
00:07:04,971 --> 00:07:05,804
which is very close to standard Danish 
but which uses Norwegian pronunciation 

141
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:09,983
and knows or new Norwegian is intended 
to be a pure version of Norwegian based 

142
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:17,120
on Norway is more conservative Western 
dialect.

143
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:17,760
Okay.

144
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,220
Which Standard Language Norwegians are 
educated in,

145
00:07:20,221 --> 00:07:24,060
depends on the region they grow up in.
But despite having two official standard

146
00:07:24,061 --> 00:07:26,610
languages,
Norwegians don't really speak them.

147
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:27,563
Norwegians generally speak their own 
local dialect whenever they are 

148
00:07:30,271 --> 00:07:31,104
speaking,
even in formal situations and even when 

149
00:07:32,821 --> 00:07:35,610
they're speaking to people from the 
other Scandinavian countries.

150
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,473
Because if this Norwegians have to get 
used to understanding a wide variety of 

151
00:07:39,511 --> 00:07:40,344
spoken dialects and that's probably part
of what makes it easier for them to 

152
00:07:42,901 --> 00:07:43,734
understand Swedish and Danish.
But that of course this is just my 

153
00:07:46,021 --> 00:07:47,670
speculation.
So native speakers,

154
00:07:47,671 --> 00:07:48,504
you can confirm or disconfirm that.
So let's take a look at the three 

155
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:54,180
continental languages and see just how 
similar they are.

156
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,223
Unfortunately,
I wasn't able to find a volunteer to 

157
00:07:56,911 --> 00:07:57,744
help me with the Danish sentences.
But let's look at Norwegian and Swedish 

158
00:08:00,931 --> 00:08:01,764
and that will give you a general idea of
how similar the continental languages 

159
00:08:04,981 --> 00:08:06,720
are.
I love you

160
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:08,250
y'all.
Ed.

161
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,700
Skip Day ends today.

162
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:12,640
Okay.

163
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,000
Dogs are the best pets.
Hmm Dad,

164
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:19,500
Adam Besta who's viewed as the best 
shall indeed.

165
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,510
Tomorrow I will go to Germany.

166
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:28,320
You Marvin sky cutting this clans Emr 
Scalia draw to this client.

167
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:33,760
The party was fun because I liked the 
music part.

168
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:38,910
[inaudible] part is far more so for the 
Yeti Tennessee Cam.

169
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:42,010
Okay.

170
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:42,843
So you can probably see just how similar
these three languages are and you can 

171
00:08:45,461 --> 00:08:46,294
probably see how relatively speaking 
they are easy for English speakers to 

172
00:08:49,421 --> 00:08:50,254
learn.
They are all category one languages 

173
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:54,430
according to the American Foreign 
Service Institute,

174
00:08:54,431 --> 00:08:57,180
which trains for their overseas 
assignments.

175
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:01,080
None of the north dramatic languages are
amongst the most widely spoken languages

176
00:09:01,081 --> 00:09:01,914
in the world.
And people from the Nordic countries 

177
00:09:03,421 --> 00:09:04,254
generally speak excellent English.
So is it a waste of time to learn a 

178
00:09:07,081 --> 00:09:09,060
north Germanic language?
Of course not.

179
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,240
If you're interested in the cultures and
the history of that region,

180
00:09:12,241 --> 00:09:15,000
then learning one of the languages could
bring you immense joy.

181
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:18,300
And because the three Scandinavian 
languages are so similar,

182
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,090
learning one of them can unlock the 
doors to the other ones,

183
00:09:21,091 --> 00:09:21,924
especially of the written languages.
And if you're an avid traveler or you 

184
00:09:24,721 --> 00:09:28,230
want to go backpacking around the world,
then you will probably meet a surprising

185
00:09:28,231 --> 00:09:29,064
number of Scandinavians and knowing 
their language or even one of the other 

186
00:09:31,651 --> 00:09:32,484
two languages will help you break the 
ice and get to know some wonderful and 

187
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,320
possibly highly attractive people.

188
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:39,960
And if you are interested in the old 
Nordic cultures,

189
00:09:39,961 --> 00:09:40,794
then you might benefit from learning 
Icelandic since written Icelandic is 

190
00:09:43,471 --> 00:09:44,304
still very similar to old norse,
so don't hesitate to start learning one 

191
00:09:47,401 --> 00:09:48,234
of the north Germanic languages,
which could be your portal into a whole 

192
00:09:51,001 --> 00:09:53,340
new world itself.
The question of the day,

193
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:55,680
native speakers of north dramatic 
languages,

194
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:58,830
what does your experience communicating 
with the speakers of other languages?

195
00:09:58,831 --> 00:09:59,664
Which of the other languages do you 
understand the most and how do you 

196
00:10:01,741 --> 00:10:05,970
bridge that communication gap?
We'd like to know and everyone else jump

197
00:10:05,971 --> 00:10:09,790
in and leave whatever comments you want.
Thank you for watching and have a nice,

198
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:12,823
sure.
