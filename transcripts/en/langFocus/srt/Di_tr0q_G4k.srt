00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:12,453
Hello everyone.
Today we're going to focus on the 

2
00:00:14,291 --> 00:00:15,124
languages of Singapore.
Singapore has one of the few remaining 

3
00:00:18,311 --> 00:00:19,144
city states in the world located in 
Southeast Asia at the tip of the Malay 

4
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:24,363
Peninsula.
The archipelago that makes up Singapore 

5
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,270
is just a stone's throw away from 
peninsular.

6
00:00:28,271 --> 00:00:31,450
Malaysia separated from it by the 
streets of Johor.

7
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:34,740
Despite being one of the smallest 
countries in the world.

8
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:35,623
Singapore is a culturally and 
linguistically diverse place and as one 

9
00:00:38,861 --> 00:00:40,840
of the world's leading financial 
centers,

10
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:44,950
it continues to attract immigrants and 
ex patriots from around the world.

11
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:46,053
Singapore was originally a molay trading
port called Tomasek around the 14th 

12
00:00:49,811 --> 00:00:52,540
century and later became known as single
Pooda.

13
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:53,703
It eventually fell into obscurity until 
it was established as a British trading 

14
00:00:57,101 --> 00:01:02,101
colony in 1819 from 1963 to 1965 
Singapore briefly became part of the new

15
00:01:03,671 --> 00:01:04,504
federation of Malaysia,
which was formed from former British 

16
00:01:06,911 --> 00:01:07,960
colonies in the region.

17
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:12,280
It then became independent in 1965 while
under British rule,

18
00:01:12,281 --> 00:01:13,114
Singapore had a free trade policy which 
attracted Chinese traders and laborers 

19
00:01:16,691 --> 00:01:17,524
from Malaysia and China and Chinese grew
to become the majority of the 

20
00:01:20,531 --> 00:01:22,240
population.
Also,

21
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:25,630
Singapore and India were under British 
rule at the same time,

22
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:28,210
which led to a flow of migrants from 
India.

23
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,910
Today,
and for most of Singapore's history,

24
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:31,803
ethnic Indians have formed the third 
largest ethnic group in Singapore after 

25
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:36,094
Chinese and malaise.
Singapore has four official languages 

26
00:01:38,801 --> 00:01:39,634
that were chosen to represent the 
largest ethnic groups in the country at 

27
00:01:42,671 --> 00:01:44,530
the time that the constitution was 
written.

28
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:45,603
First English,
due to Singapore's history as a British 

29
00:01:47,951 --> 00:01:48,784
colony,
Mandarin Chinese to unite the large 

30
00:01:50,891 --> 00:01:51,724
Chinese population molay which doubles 
as the national language of Singapore 

31
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:56,283
because it's the language of the 
indigenous population and Tamil to 

32
00:01:58,961 --> 00:02:03,280
represent the Indian population of 
Singapore on an administrative level.

33
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,250
The unofficial Lingua Franca of the 
country is English,

34
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:09,490
and it serves as the main language of 
instruction in schools.

35
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,640
The language of the justice system and 
the language of business.

36
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:13,653
The vast majority of Singapore ends are 
bilingual as a result of the country's 

37
00:02:16,961 --> 00:02:17,794
education policy with 73.2%
of the population identifying as 

38
00:02:22,031 --> 00:02:26,320
bilingual or multilingual.
All Singaporeans are now mainly educated

39
00:02:26,321 --> 00:02:27,154
in English,
but they're also required to take 

40
00:02:28,661 --> 00:02:29,494
courses in the mother tongue that 
corresponds to their ethnic background 

41
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:33,843
that so-called mother tongue doesn't 
necessarily correspond to the student's 

42
00:02:36,941 --> 00:02:40,570
native language and it's better to think
of it as a heritage language.

43
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,350
Mandarin is the mother tongue assigned 
to students of Chinese background,

44
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,273
even though the students family might 
use a different Chinese language or 

45
00:02:47,711 --> 00:02:49,390
English at home.
Similarly,

46
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:51,220
Tamil is the mother tongue,
a scientist,

47
00:02:51,221 --> 00:02:52,054
students of Indian background,
even though they may speak a different 

48
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:55,174
Indian language or English at home and 
Molay is the mother tongue assigned to 

49
00:02:58,751 --> 00:02:59,584
students molay background,
even though some may speak English or 

50
00:03:02,381 --> 00:03:03,490
another language at home.

51
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,713
Now,
let's take a look at each of the four 

52
00:03:05,741 --> 00:03:07,510
official languages.
English,

53
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,673
the official language most commonly 
spoken at home is English with 

54
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:12,274
approximately 36.9%
of the resident population speaking it 

55
00:03:16,031 --> 00:03:18,670
as their first language with the rest of
the population.

56
00:03:18,671 --> 00:03:19,504
Having some level of fluency.
There are very few Singaporeans who 

57
00:03:22,181 --> 00:03:24,940
speak no English and amongst the younger
generation,

58
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:25,803
basically everybody speaks it fluently.
English was made the main language of 

59
00:03:29,351 --> 00:03:34,090
school instruction in all government 
schools beginning in 1987 before that,

60
00:03:34,091 --> 00:03:37,450
different schools offered instruction in
different mother tongues,

61
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,583
immigrants and ex pats aside.
There are two basic forms of English 

62
00:03:41,261 --> 00:03:43,830
that are used in Singapore.
First standards,

63
00:03:43,831 --> 00:03:44,664
Singaporean English,
which is based on the conventions of 

64
00:03:46,691 --> 00:03:47,524
British English,
but it's spoken with a uniquely 

65
00:03:49,061 --> 00:03:49,894
Singaporean accent and an English creole
known academically as colloquial 

66
00:03:53,741 --> 00:03:57,220
Singaporean English and more popularly 
known as singlish.

67
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:58,293
The standard form of the language is 
highly promoted by the government of 

68
00:04:00,911 --> 00:04:01,744
Singapore through state sponsored 
programs such as the speak good English 

69
00:04:04,841 --> 00:04:08,680
movement that was specifically started 
in order to curb the use of English.

70
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,990
But why do they care if people use 
singlish?

71
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:12,003
Well,
I suppose that's because they want 

72
00:04:12,881 --> 00:04:13,714
people to use a form of English that can
successfully be used in academic and 

73
00:04:17,111 --> 00:04:17,944
professional situations.
But speaking singlish doesn't mean that 

74
00:04:20,471 --> 00:04:21,304
you can't speak standard English.
Standard English and singlish exist 

75
00:04:24,341 --> 00:04:28,870
along a socio elect continuum meaning 
that the form of English used depends on

76
00:04:28,871 --> 00:04:32,500
the social context.
In the most formal situations people use

77
00:04:32,501 --> 00:04:33,334
standard English and in the most 
informal situations they might use pure 

78
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:37,234
singlish and they often mix them to 
varying degrees depending on the level 

79
00:04:40,331 --> 00:04:45,331
of formality of the situation.
Singlish is topic prominent like Chinese

80
00:04:45,371 --> 00:04:46,204
or Japanese and as such many sentences,
we'll begin by mentioning the topic of 

81
00:04:49,841 --> 00:04:50,674
the sentence first.
Other noticeable features are that the 

82
00:04:52,601 --> 00:04:53,434
use of the plural form of nouns as well 
as articles and the verb to be are all 

83
00:04:57,221 --> 00:04:58,054
optional and also the grammatical 
subject can be dropped if it's clear 

84
00:05:01,271 --> 00:05:02,104
from the context.
Here are a couple of examples of 

85
00:05:04,301 --> 00:05:05,134
singlish

86
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:07,960
our drawings,
those impact how to pass

87
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,273
and in standard English something like 
how can we get good marks with such a 

88
00:05:12,191 --> 00:05:15,400
simple drawing.
In this sentence we see topic prominence

89
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,920
with the topic placed at the beginning 
of the sentence

90
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:19,970
still got heading

91
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:23,060
and in standard English I've still got a
headache.

92
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,073
In this sentence,
you can see that the subject isn't 

93
00:05:25,731 --> 00:05:30,230
included and there's also no auxiliary 
verb and there's no indefinite article.

94
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:33,030
The Nisha already law

95
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:35,790
in this sentence,
the subject isn't included,

96
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:36,743
so you would only know who or what has 
finished from the context of the 

97
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:42,960
previous sentences and notice the word 
at the end of the sentence.

98
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:43,883
La.
This word emphasizes a statement or 

99
00:05:45,751 --> 00:05:46,584
assertion.
There are other similar words that show 

100
00:05:48,511 --> 00:05:51,270
uncertainty or indicate that you're 
asking a question.

101
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:55,530
These words are borrowed from varieties 
of Chinese like Hokkien and in fact,

102
00:05:55,531 --> 00:05:58,820
many of the features of singlish are in 
those Chinese varieties.

103
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:02,880
And one more example that you can rise 
restaurant over there.

104
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:03,743
See Bait the Kong,
their food dye dye must try in standard 

105
00:06:08,011 --> 00:06:08,844
English.
That chicken rice restaurant over there 

106
00:06:10,321 --> 00:06:12,630
has amazingly good food.
We've got to try it.

107
00:06:12,631 --> 00:06:13,464
If it's the last thing we do,
this first sentence starts off like 

108
00:06:15,781 --> 00:06:18,450
standard English,
but then we see this phrase here,

109
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,313
seabed topcon.
Topcon is a phrase from Hokkien which 

110
00:06:21,571 --> 00:06:22,404
means very good and CBA is an 
intensifier with the somewhat grim 

111
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:26,484
etymology.

112
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:27,693
In the second sentence,
you see the topic placed at the 

113
00:06:29,411 --> 00:06:30,244
beginning again and there's no subject 
in the sentence because it's clear from 

114
00:06:33,401 --> 00:06:37,410
the context and then we have this unique
adverbial phrase die,

115
00:06:37,411 --> 00:06:38,244
die.
Even though the use of singlish is 

116
00:06:40,331 --> 00:06:41,164
discouraged by the government,
that doesn't really mean that it's on 

117
00:06:43,211 --> 00:06:44,590
the decline.
In fact,

118
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,453
to many people,
English has become a source of local 

119
00:06:47,351 --> 00:06:48,184
pride and identity and just as there 
have been attempts to stamp it out into 

120
00:06:51,311 --> 00:06:54,610
diminish its use,
there has also been a significant amount

121
00:06:54,611 --> 00:06:55,444
of pushback from locals who want to 
prevent it from disappearing completely 

122
00:06:59,080 --> 00:06:59,913
mandarin after English.
The second most commonly used language 

123
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:07,960
at home is Mandarin Chinese,
which is used by around 34.9%

124
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:10,450
of the resident population as a first 
language.

125
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:13,720
But if we add to that,
all of the other varieties of Chinese,

126
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:17,380
which are around 12.2%
of the population than Chinese,

127
00:07:17,381 --> 00:07:19,900
comprises the largest language group in 
Singapore.

128
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:22,270
But to be clear,
that's a group of languages,

129
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:25,630
not just one language.
Before the Constitution of Singapore was

130
00:07:25,631 --> 00:07:26,464
written.
Both Mandarin and Hokkien functioned as 

131
00:07:28,271 --> 00:07:30,880
Lingua Franca for the diverse Chinese 
community.

132
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:32,163
When the constitution was written in 
1965 the government chose Mandarin in 

133
00:07:35,921 --> 00:07:36,754
order to officially unite the population
and then in 1979 the government led by 

134
00:07:41,081 --> 00:07:41,914
Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew started the 
now annual speak Mandarin campaign to 

135
00:07:45,581 --> 00:07:46,414
continuously promote the use and 
learning of the language instead of 

136
00:07:49,091 --> 00:07:49,924
other Chinese languages.
This has resulted in an increase in the 

137
00:07:52,391 --> 00:07:53,224
number of mandarin speakers and a 
decrease in the number of speakers of 

138
00:07:55,961 --> 00:07:56,794
other Chinese languages and I guess that
was exactly the intention of that 

139
00:07:59,741 --> 00:08:00,574
program.
The form of Mandarin used in Singapore 

140
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:06,220
very closely follows the conventions of 
the mandarin used in China and Taiwan.

141
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,110
However,
just as with English,

142
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,033
Mandarin and Singapore has not been able
to avoid the influence of other 

143
00:08:11,981 --> 00:08:16,270
languages and has developed a socio 
elekta continuum just as English has.

144
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:17,283
On opposite ends of the spectrum,
you have standard mandarin and sing 

145
00:08:20,441 --> 00:08:23,720
Durham or colloquial Singaporean 
mandarin sing.

146
00:08:23,721 --> 00:08:27,850
Dorin is a result of the wide adoption 
of Mandarin by speakers of other Chinese

147
00:08:27,851 --> 00:08:30,640
languages,
as well as contact with languages of the

148
00:08:30,641 --> 00:08:31,474
other ethnic communities,
singer and seems to have some creole 

149
00:08:34,421 --> 00:08:37,060
elements as well as an element of code 
switching,

150
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:41,590
especially with English.
The grammar is essentially mandarin with

151
00:08:41,591 --> 00:08:44,500
a lot of vocabulary borrowed from other 
Chinese languages,

152
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:49,150
ballet as well as English and sometimes 
entire phrases or clauses or in English.

153
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:52,840
Here are a couple of sentences in sing 
Durham Conan.

154
00:08:52,841 --> 00:08:56,530
Next week,
how's the whole woman tie an English?

155
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,650
Maybe we can meet next week after I 
finished my exams.

156
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:00,933
In this first sentence,
we see basically a mandarin sentence 

157
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:06,580
with some English vocabulary taking the 
place of Mandarin words

158
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:09,993
wait

159
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:13,200
and English.
The weather today is too hot.

160
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:16,560
I can't stand it.
In the second sentence we see an English

161
00:09:16,561 --> 00:09:20,040
word and then this word boy is a Hokkien
word,

162
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:20,903
meaning cannot,
and this word [inaudible] Hahn is a 

163
00:09:22,891 --> 00:09:24,420
Malay word,
meaning tolerate.

164
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:27,300
These two words often appear together in
this phrase,

165
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:29,400
meaning something like,
I can't stand it.

166
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:31,143
Other forms of Chinese spoken in 
Singapore apart from Mandarin and 

167
00:09:33,641 --> 00:09:38,170
Hokkien include guilt.
You Cantonese Haka and high knees,

168
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,213
but the government's promotion of 
Mandarin is causing it to gradually 

169
00:09:41,801 --> 00:09:46,420
replace the others Malai.
The third most widely spoken of the four

170
00:09:46,421 --> 00:09:49,600
official languages is molay or Bahasa 
Melayu,

171
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:54,400
which is spoken by around 10.7%
of the officially resident population.

172
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:55,443
Malaya has also given special status as 
the national language of Singapore as a 

173
00:09:59,351 --> 00:10:00,184
result of this special status.
It's used in the national anthem in 

174
00:10:02,891 --> 00:10:05,950
military drills and on the Singaporean 
coat of arms.

175
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:10,870
Malaysia and Singapore in its standard 
form is essentially the same as standard

176
00:10:10,871 --> 00:10:14,740
molay as used in Malaysia and in Brunei.
In addition to standard Molay,

177
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:19,030
there's also a molay creole called Baba 
Malai or Peranakan Malai,

178
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,073
which is endangered,
but it's still spoken fluently by some 

179
00:10:22,001 --> 00:10:22,834
older people.
The peranakan are the descendants of 

180
00:10:24,881 --> 00:10:25,714
settlers who married local malaise.
This contact of cultures resulted in a 

181
00:10:29,381 --> 00:10:31,930
creole language with mostly malave 
vocabulary,

182
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,793
but with influence of Chinese grammar.
There's another similar form of molay 

183
00:10:36,971 --> 00:10:40,910
called Bazaar Malaysia or Malaya Pasada,
a pigeon form of my leg,

184
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,860
which has no native speakers.
Decades ago when English was less widely

185
00:10:44,861 --> 00:10:45,694
spoken.
Bazaar molay often functioned as a 

186
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:48,124
Lingua Franca.
It's now spoken mainly by some older 

187
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:54,490
Singaporeans.
Here's an example of bazaar millay.

188
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:57,460
I'll give you a sentence.
Meaning when a Singaporean,

189
00:10:57,461 --> 00:10:58,294
here's where goods are cheap,
he goes there first in Standard Malaya 

190
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,910
[inaudible] Monday,
Nada,

191
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,980
10 Dung,
Tim Pat,

192
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:05,823
young men pony I baton Woulda,
[inaudible] huggy Kissy to a more or 

193
00:11:09,281 --> 00:11:13,750
less direct translation into English 
would be when person of Singapore.

194
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:18,840
Here's about place that has cheap goods.
He will go to there next in bazaar,

195
00:11:20,391 --> 00:11:23,820
Millay Singapore up when you're done 
telling a dia de God man,

196
00:11:23,821 --> 00:11:24,860
a young bud,
Buddha,

197
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,300
the buggy,
uh,

198
00:11:26,301 --> 00:11:30,320
more or less direct translation of this 
would be Singapore's person.

199
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,500
His ear here,
where that goods cheap,

200
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:34,603
he goes in the bazaar millay sentence,
the word for when is absent and then we 

201
00:11:39,521 --> 00:11:43,330
see a different way of expressing 
Singaporean in standard molay.

202
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,343
The word [inaudible],
meaning person comes first and the 

203
00:11:46,391 --> 00:11:49,960
modifying word single Pooda comes after 
in bazaar millay.

204
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:50,823
The modifier Singapore comes before and 
followed by the modifying particle 

205
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,833
Poonja.
This word exists in Standard Malaya and 

206
00:11:57,731 --> 00:11:58,564
means have an actually,
you can see it as the root of this word 

207
00:12:01,241 --> 00:12:02,074
right here and then Brunei.
But in bazaar molay it mimics this 

208
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:05,524
Chinese modifying particle.
Let me point out one more difference in 

209
00:12:09,091 --> 00:12:10,410
the standard molay sentence.

210
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,273
You see the word for here when the God,
but in Bazaar Molay you see Donato in 

211
00:12:15,981 --> 00:12:18,650
bazaar,
Millay affixes are often dropped and the

212
00:12:18,651 --> 00:12:21,980
word root is used instead.
Tamil,

213
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,820
the least widely spoken of the four 
official languages is Tamil,

214
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:26,773
uh,
dravidian language that is spoken 

215
00:12:27,801 --> 00:12:28,634
primarily in southern India and in some 
parts of Sri Lanka and has also spoken 

216
00:12:32,421 --> 00:12:33,254
by a significant minority in Malaysia.
It has approximately 70 million native 

217
00:12:37,371 --> 00:12:39,980
speakers worldwide.
In Singapore,

218
00:12:39,981 --> 00:12:40,814
9.1%
of the population is of Indian 

219
00:12:43,011 --> 00:12:45,170
background,
but only 3.3%

220
00:12:45,171 --> 00:12:47,450
speak Tamil as their main language at 
home.

221
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:48,343
Many ethnic Indians speak English as 
their home language or another Indian 

222
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:52,304
language or my lay.
At the time when Tamil was chosen as an 

223
00:12:55,671 --> 00:12:56,504
official language,
it was spoken by the majority of the 

224
00:12:58,371 --> 00:12:59,204
Indian population of Singapore.
But the language has declined and has 

225
00:13:02,301 --> 00:13:03,134
now learned as a second language by the 
majority of the Indian population since 

226
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:08,930
it's still their assigned mother tongue.

227
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,073
This information we've discussed so far 
includes the so called resident 

228
00:13:14,241 --> 00:13:15,074
population which is comprised of both 
citizens and permanent residents of 

229
00:13:18,411 --> 00:13:19,244
Singapore.
The total resident population is about 

230
00:13:21,351 --> 00:13:22,184
3.9
million but there's also a large non 

231
00:13:24,381 --> 00:13:27,560
resident population of about 1.7
million people.

232
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,513
The term non resident is misleading and 
you should think of them as non 

233
00:13:31,371 --> 00:13:32,204
permanent residents or as expatriates 
because we're not talking about 

234
00:13:35,301 --> 00:13:36,134
tourists.
These are people who do reside in 

235
00:13:37,461 --> 00:13:40,520
Singapore having one of the freest 
economies in the world.

236
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:44,420
Singapore has attracted a large number 
of foreign companies and foreign workers

237
00:13:44,421 --> 00:13:45,254
to its shores making Singapore a 
cosmopolitan business and finance hub 

238
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:51,830
where you can hear languages from all 
over the world being spoken.

239
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:52,843
The main Lingua Franca used amongst 
these diverse groups of people is 

240
00:13:55,491 --> 00:13:56,324
English with Mandarin.
Also serving as a Lingua Franca for the 

241
00:13:58,701 --> 00:13:59,534
Chinese community,
both residents and non resident with 

242
00:14:01,851 --> 00:14:02,684
Singapore granting permanent residence 
and citizenship to new immigrants every 

243
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:06,260
year.

244
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,093
The linguistic situation there will 
certainly continue to be rich and 

245
00:14:09,921 --> 00:14:10,754
colorful and vibrant.
The question of the day for 

246
00:14:13,281 --> 00:14:14,114
Singaporeans,
what languages do you regularly speak 

247
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,533
and in what situations do you use them?
And for other people living in 

248
00:14:20,361 --> 00:14:21,194
Singapore,
what language do you use most often 

249
00:14:23,001 --> 00:14:24,860
there?
If you speak English,

250
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:28,490
what has been your experience with 
Singaporean English and singlish?

251
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:31,420
Be sure to follow Lang,
focus on facebook,

252
00:14:31,421 --> 00:14:32,890
twitter,
and instagram.

253
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:33,813
And once again,
thank you to all of my amazing patrion 

254
00:14:35,891 --> 00:14:36,724
supporters,
especially these ones right here on the 

255
00:14:38,321 --> 00:14:40,930
screen.
They are my top tier patrion supporters.

256
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:43,930
So many thanks to them once again and to
all of you,

257
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:46,840
thank you for watching and have a nice 
day.

258
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:55,670
Okay.
Yeah.
