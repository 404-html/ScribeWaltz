00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,953
Hello everyone.
Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and 

2
00:00:03,151 --> 00:00:03,984
my name is Paul.
Today we'll be answering the question 

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,510
how similar our German and Dutch,
wait,

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,750
what were those two languages again?
German Deutsche,

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,130
Dutch Nadir loans.
Deutsche.

6
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:19,343
Isn't it strange that English speakers 
called the language of the Netherlands 

7
00:00:21,991 --> 00:00:25,650
and Flanders Dutch while German speakers
called their own language?

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,300
Deutsche,
why is that?

9
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:30,240
It's because there's a connection 
between Dutch and German.

10
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,193
Both are Germanic.
The English word Dutch used to refer to 

11
00:00:33,931 --> 00:00:34,764
continental Germanic peoples in general,
but then came to refer to only the 

12
00:00:38,251 --> 00:00:42,150
people of the Netherlands because of 
greater contact and rivalry with them.

13
00:00:42,151 --> 00:00:42,984
In particular,
the English word comes from the Middle 

14
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:48,540
Dutch word do teach and in modern Dutch 
Dutch,

15
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:49,583
which means German,
and this is a cognate of the German 

16
00:00:51,811 --> 00:00:52,830
word,
Deutsche.

17
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:56,400
And with that we've already begun 
comparing the two languages.

18
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,990
In Dutch they say Dutch and in German 
they say Deutsche.

19
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,910
Germanic and Dutch are both members of 
the West Germanic branch of the Germanic

20
00:01:05,911 --> 00:01:08,670
language family,
both developed from the same root,

21
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:11,430
the same ancestor language,
Pro Germanic,

22
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:15,120
which developed into Western,
eastern and northern dialect groups.

23
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,133
The Western dialects are the ancestors 
of Dutch and German and the other west 

24
00:01:19,321 --> 00:01:20,154
Germanic languages.
One thing we have to keep in mind when 

25
00:01:23,131 --> 00:01:26,910
comparing Dutch and German is that there
are many dialects of Dutch and there are

26
00:01:26,911 --> 00:01:30,840
many dialects of German and in northern 
Germany and parts of Netherlands,

27
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,660
there are dialects that arguably form 
another language,

28
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:34,523
low German or low Saxon,
and there's another regional language 

29
00:01:37,141 --> 00:01:37,974
called Frisian,
but speakers of all of these dialects 

30
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:41,123
learn either standard Dutch or standard 
German depending on which country they 

31
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:45,204
live in.
So there may be cases when German and 

32
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:47,814
Dutch speakers understand each other 
more easily when their dialects are 

33
00:01:50,461 --> 00:01:51,294
closer to each other,
but there are other situations in which 

34
00:01:53,671 --> 00:01:54,504
their dialects are further apart and it 
would be easiest to communicate in the 

35
00:01:57,331 --> 00:01:58,350
standard languages.

36
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,393
In this video,
I'll focus on standard Dutch and 

37
00:02:01,171 --> 00:02:05,850
standard German vocabulary.
Dutch and German share a large amount of

38
00:02:05,851 --> 00:02:06,684
cognitive vocabulary.
According to one source I've seen their 

39
00:02:09,061 --> 00:02:09,894
lexical similarity is around 84% which 
is slightly lower than Spanish and 

40
00:02:13,861 --> 00:02:18,861
Italian or Spanish and Portuguese.
84% lexical similarity doesn't mean that

41
00:02:19,021 --> 00:02:23,160
84% of the words are exactly the same.
It means that they are cognates.

42
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:26,820
They come from a common origin,
but they may have a different form or be

43
00:02:26,821 --> 00:02:28,830
pronounced differently.
Some examples,

44
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,873
the word for glass in German and in 
Dutch plus the word for water in German 

45
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,590
and in Dutch.
That or the word for dog,

46
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:46,110
hence the word for brother Buddha,
Buddha,

47
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:49,140
but this here is actually an archaic 
form of the word.

48
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:54,410
The modern form of the word is the word 
for sister Smith Zoster.

49
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,800
This is also an archaic form.
The modern form is just,

50
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:01,780
and here are a couple of phrases.

51
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:05,190
Good Morning Guten Morgen who?
Morgan,

52
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:08,700
good day or good afternoon.
Guten tag.

53
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:09,983
Who did?
Ah,

54
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,100
it's sunny,
it's sunny.

55
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:16,450
Who dish.
There are a lot of cognates like that,

56
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,570
but there are false cognates as well.
In Dutch.

57
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:24,660
J Means C and Mir means lake in German.
Z means lake and mia mean C,

58
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:30,940
but there's actually a bit more to it 
than that.

59
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:35,890
There's actually a masculine word,
desi meaning lake and a feminine word.

60
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,793
Dizzy meaning see in Dutch Leeson means 
to lie as an to tell a lie in German 

61
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:47,620
leagon means to lie as in to lie down on
a bed.

62
00:03:47,621 --> 00:03:48,454
For example,
in Dutch listen means to lie on 

63
00:03:51,461 --> 00:03:55,930
something like a bed in German.
Logan means to tell a lie.

64
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:59,590
In Dutch,
painless means painful,

65
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:03,460
but in German normally means 
embarrassing.

66
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:09,180
In Dutch [inaudible] mean it's be 
allowed to and in German means to like,

67
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,860
but hold on a second.

68
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:12,723
The Dutch word can also be used with the
meaning to like specifically when you 

69
00:04:16,091 --> 00:04:16,924
like a person,
the German word is used more generally 

70
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:19,863
for people or things you like.
So even though a lot of cognates may be 

71
00:04:23,831 --> 00:04:24,664
obvious or easy to decipher,
assuming that they mean the same thing 

72
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:30,190
might cause some confusion.
Pronunciation,

73
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,030
I'm sure you noticed that most of those 
cognate words sounded a little different

74
00:04:34,031 --> 00:04:35,860
and some of them sounded quite 
different.

75
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:39,850
One of the biggest differences between 
Dutch and German is the different sounds

76
00:04:39,851 --> 00:04:43,540
in either language and how these results
in cognate words that sound different.

77
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:44,643
Some of the differences between Dutch 
and German are a result of the high 

78
00:04:47,261 --> 00:04:48,094
German consonant shift which took place 
in the few hundred years leading up to 

79
00:04:51,341 --> 00:04:52,174
the ninth century.
German descends from dialects that were 

80
00:04:54,311 --> 00:04:55,144
affected by these changes.
While Dutch descends from dialects that 

81
00:04:57,731 --> 00:05:01,510
were not affected by these changes 
because of the shift,

82
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,480
voiceless stops to and come in.

83
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,313
Dutch tend to be fricatives for sup and 
in German cognates when between vowels 

84
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,960
or after a vowel at the end of a word 
for example,

85
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:14,823
the words meaning ship in Dutch skip and
in German shoes and the words meaning 

86
00:05:20,501 --> 00:05:21,334
water in Dutch that are and in German 
and the Pronoun meaning I in Dutch Ig 

87
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:29,523
and in German these same voiceless stops
became Africans for sub or at the 

88
00:05:36,761 --> 00:05:41,140
beginning of a word or if they were 
doubled consonants or if they came after

89
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:43,270
an l or our sound.
For example,

90
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:48,480
the words for apple in Dutch fucking and
in German and the words meaning heart in

91
00:05:50,351 --> 00:05:51,184
Dutch hearts and in German.
The third challenge cup changing to cut 

92
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:00,470
occurred only an upper German dialect 
and not in standard German.

93
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,460
Another shift also took place in the 
voice stops,

94
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:08,960
Buh Duh and gum which became voiceless 
and cook,

95
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:13,010
but with only the dump to touch shift 
taking place in standard German.

96
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:16,130
The other changes only took place in 
upper German dialects.

97
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,083
For example,
the word for day in Dutch and in German 

98
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:24,050
tack.
Remember before when I said that certain

99
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:24,884
German speakers would have an easier 
time understanding Dutch because of 

100
00:06:27,561 --> 00:06:28,730
their dialects?
Well,

101
00:06:28,731 --> 00:06:32,720
that's especially true for low German 
dialects because like Dutch,

102
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,600
they didn't undergo this hydromatic 
consonant shift.

103
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:40,460
There was another sound change that 
affected high German but also low German

104
00:06:40,461 --> 00:06:41,294
and Dutch thumb and the became duck.
This explains why Germans still has a 

105
00:06:46,131 --> 00:06:49,810
Duh sound even though there was an 
earlier shift from Dakota.

106
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:50,863
There are also other sound differences 
that are not a result of the hydromatic 

107
00:06:53,931 --> 00:06:54,764
consonant shift.
Notice the different g sounds in the 

108
00:06:57,111 --> 00:06:57,944
word for God in Dutch holds and in 
German the German is more or less like 

109
00:07:03,981 --> 00:07:07,070
the English good.
That Dutch sound varies depending on the

110
00:07:07,071 --> 00:07:09,770
region,
but as a villa or uvular fricative,

111
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:11,323
you may have also noticed that the wwe 
sounded different in the words for 

112
00:07:13,941 --> 00:07:15,560
water,
so let's hear those again.

113
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,453
In Dutch Vassar and in German,
the German sound is similar to the v 

114
00:07:21,171 --> 00:07:22,070
sound.
In English,

115
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:23,203
the Dutch W is pronounced differently in
the beginning or in the middle of the 

116
00:07:26,031 --> 00:07:26,864
word.
It's sort of between a va and the what 

117
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,380
sounds,
but at the end of a word,

118
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:32,120
after a vowel,
it's a glide.

119
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,103
Just like w in English,
our sounds are sounds very quite a lot 

120
00:07:37,371 --> 00:07:39,950
in either language,
depending on where the speakers from,

121
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,020
but they're often different in either 
language.

122
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,003
For example,
the word for year in Dutch and in 

123
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:47,410
German.
Yeah,

124
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,613
in the Dutch word.
The final r sounds like a retroflex 

125
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:55,010
approximate raw,
like in some varieties of English,

126
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:55,933
but other speakers say it as a trilled 
are and when it's not at the end of the 

127
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:00,050
word,
the trilled are,

128
00:08:00,051 --> 00:08:00,884
is more consistently used,
especially in northern areas and in the 

129
00:08:04,251 --> 00:08:06,710
German word,
the Rs pronounced as a vowel.

130
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,053
It's also pronounced as a vowel.
In some other contexts like between 

131
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:14,030
vowels or after a long vowel and before 
another consonant.

132
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:17,150
In other contexts,
it's more like a voice to uvular,

133
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,960
fricative,
ah,

134
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:21,350
at least in a standard accent of 
Germany.

135
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,400
Here's another example using the words 
meaning rough in Dutch.

136
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,013
Here you can clearly hear the trilled 
are and in German some consonants are 

137
00:08:31,971 --> 00:08:32,804
spelled the same but sound different.
Some are spelled differently and sound 

138
00:08:35,811 --> 00:08:39,110
different and others are spelled 
differently but sounded the same.

139
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:43,430
One example is that Czi is spelled as 
zed in Dutch,

140
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:47,000
but as s in German,
German s is also pronounced,

141
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:51,290
so at the end of a word or after 
consonants other than l and nasals,

142
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:56,310
two words we saw earlier are German and 
Dutch Zuma.

143
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,460
There are many differences in vowels as 
well.

144
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:00,443
Some are spelled differently,
but sound basically the same like the 

145
00:09:02,821 --> 00:09:04,770
words meaning year that we saw a minute 
ago.

146
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:09,540
Let's hear those again and focus on the 
vowel in Dutch and in German.

147
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:10,693
Yeah,
notice that the vowel is spelled 

148
00:09:12,181 --> 00:09:14,010
differently.
Another example,

149
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,730
the words meaning good in Dutch hoots 
and in German.

150
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:20,723
There were also a lot of pairs of 
cognates in which the vowel sounds have 

151
00:09:23,251 --> 00:09:25,650
become different and that is reflected 
in their spelling.

152
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:26,723
For example,
their words for dream in Dutch and in 

153
00:09:29,911 --> 00:09:30,744
German town along o vowel in Dutch often
corresponds with this diphthong in 

154
00:09:35,131 --> 00:09:35,964
German the words meaning body but to 
cognate with the English word life in 

155
00:09:40,411 --> 00:09:41,244
Dutch lace and in German.
These diphthongs often correspond with 

156
00:09:46,021 --> 00:09:46,854
each other.
Another similar example is the word for 

157
00:09:48,571 --> 00:09:49,404
bite in Dutch Bayton and in German Bison
also notice this German letter that 

158
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:56,124
represents the sound sub after long 
vowels or diphthongs as opposed to a 

159
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:03,350
double s after short vowels.
This orthographic symbols,

160
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,520
it doesn't exist in Dutch,
in Dutch,

161
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,383
so is always represented by a single s 
and it's worth noting that this symbol 

162
00:10:10,381 --> 00:10:12,660
is not used in Swiss standard German 
either.

163
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:15,870
They always write it as a double s 
grammar.

164
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:17,243
There are some important similarities 
and some important differences between 

165
00:10:19,771 --> 00:10:20,604
the grammar of the two languages.
One difference is their use of 

166
00:10:22,891 --> 00:10:25,590
grammatical gender.
German has three genders,

167
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,480
masculine,
feminine and Neuter,

168
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,350
which applied to announce their articles
and adjectives that modify them.

169
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,050
Dutch historically had the same three 
genders,

170
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,940
but in practice,
in modern Dutch,

171
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:39,600
masculine and feminine essentially form 
a single common gender.

172
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,530
So the only grammatical distinction is 
between common gender and neuter.

173
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,890
And related to that,
German has three definite articles.

174
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:50,160
While duck has two and for indefinite 
articles,

175
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:52,770
German has just two and Dutch has just 
won.

176
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,460
Another difference is that German has 
nauman cases,

177
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,970
different forms of nouns depending on 
their function in the sentence.

178
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:03,720
The four cases in German are nominative,
genitive Datas,

179
00:11:03,721 --> 00:11:06,750
and accusative.
Dutch used to have now in cases,

180
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:07,613
but they fell out of use in the spoken 
language and in the 1940s they were 

181
00:11:10,591 --> 00:11:12,210
dropped from the standard language.

182
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,240
Now they appear and some older idioms,
but that's about it.

183
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,680
That lack of noun cases arguably makes 
Dutch easier to learn than German,

184
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:22,020
at least in that particular way.
Oh,

185
00:11:22,021 --> 00:11:26,010
and remember a minute ago when I said 
that German has three definite articles.

186
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:27,900
Well,
it's actually not that simple.

187
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:28,973
Each definite article has some 
variations depending on the announced 

188
00:11:31,531 --> 00:11:32,364
case.
Let's look at the nominative and 

189
00:11:33,661 --> 00:11:34,494
accusative cases.
Just to illustrate these sentences mean 

190
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:42,050
the red fish is expensive in German and 
in Dutch,

191
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,930
Dutch road as this is dear.
As you can see,

192
00:11:45,931 --> 00:11:48,840
the sentences can be translated word for
word from English.

193
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:49,943
The function of the phrases meaning the 
red fish is nominative because the 

194
00:11:53,351 --> 00:11:54,184
subject of either sentence,
these sentences mean I like the red 

195
00:11:57,521 --> 00:11:58,840
fish.
In German

196
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,640
marketing [inaudible]

197
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:06,410
and in Dutch it often the low disease 
here at the phrases meaning the red fish

198
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:07,913
are the direct object,
which means their function is 

199
00:12:09,871 --> 00:12:10,704
accusative.
You can see that in Dutch the noun 

200
00:12:12,721 --> 00:12:16,200
phrase stays the same despite its 
accusative function in the sentence,

201
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,290
but in German the accusative form is 
different then.

202
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:22,920
Now that self doesn't have a special 
ending that's different depending on the

203
00:12:22,921 --> 00:12:26,100
gender and the case,
but the definite article changes and the

204
00:12:26,101 --> 00:12:26,934
adjective has a special ending.
When you consider the different case 

205
00:12:29,761 --> 00:12:32,370
forms for nouns,
articles and adjectives,

206
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:34,500
there are a lot of possible 
combinations.

207
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:39,590
These are for definite noun phrases and 
these are for indefinite noun phrases.

208
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:41,243
Learning the different cases.
Forms has a challenge for learners of 

209
00:12:43,141 --> 00:12:44,730
German,
but if you learn Dutch,

210
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:48,390
you don't have to memorize all those 
different forms and endings which affect

211
00:12:48,391 --> 00:12:49,500
nouns,
adjectives,

212
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:50,760
articles,
and possessives,

213
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,440
et cetera.
Word order.

214
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:53,483
In the sentence we just saw the word 
order was essentially the same in both 

215
00:12:56,311 --> 00:12:58,680
languages and both were the same as an 
English.

216
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:01,980
In the following sentences,
they share the same syntax,

217
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:02,814
but they're different from English.
These sentences mean I can play the 

218
00:13:05,511 --> 00:13:07,420
piano very well in German

219
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:08,690
can zack,
good,

220
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,920
Claudia speedin and in Dutch

221
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,700
ECOM,
who's piano spelling word for word?

222
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:19,760
Both sentences are I can.
Very good piano play in both sentences.

223
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:24,390
The conjugated verb and auxiliary verb 
comes second after the subject.

224
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,373
Both languages feature Vitu word order 
and in both languages the unconjugated 

225
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:30,174
verb moves to the end for clarity.
Let's simplify those previous sentences 

226
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,700
by removing the adverb phrase,
so now they mean I can play the piano.

227
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:40,590
In German he can clavio spillman

228
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:41,773
and in Dutch it come pianos Balan.
Now let's add something so that they 

229
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:48,170
mean,
I want to be able to play the piano

230
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:51,760
in German.
[inaudible] via [inaudible]

231
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,020
word for word.
It's,

232
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:56,200
I want piano play,
be able to,

233
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:59,520
and in Dutch it Kerrville,
piano,

234
00:13:59,521 --> 00:14:01,470
cleanness,
spillane word for word.

235
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:06,220
It's I want piano be able to play in 
Dutch.

236
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:09,580
When another auxiliary verbus added this
auxiliary verb,

237
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:10,493
[inaudible] gets moved back.
But the main lexical verb is still at 

238
00:14:13,301 --> 00:14:14,620
the end.
In German,

239
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:17,680
the equivalent auxiliary verb gets moved
to the end.

240
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:18,723
After the lexical verb,
the same difference occurs in relative 

241
00:14:21,701 --> 00:14:24,550
clauses.
These sentences mean he knows that I can

242
00:14:24,551 --> 00:14:25,384
play the piano

243
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:28,760
in German advice.
Does he clubish Billington

244
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:29,973
word for word,
it's he knows that I piano play Ken and 

245
00:14:34,031 --> 00:14:38,530
in Dutch hiv-aids don't take piano 
concert and word for word eds.

246
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:39,423
He knows that I piano Ken play.
So while the word order is generally 

247
00:14:43,951 --> 00:14:44,784
similar,
there are some differences in the 

248
00:14:45,841 --> 00:14:46,674
details like that.
Let's look at one more final sentence 

249
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:51,060
and see what we find.
Let's compare two.

250
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:55,490
Meaning if I had enough money,
I'd buy a car first in Dutch,

251
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,350
Joelton,
Alto,

252
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:02,150
copen word for word.
It's if I enough money,

253
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:06,440
had wood I uh,
car by next in German.

254
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:11,480
Verdad Ishmael,
how to them word for word.

255
00:15:11,481 --> 00:15:16,481
It's if I enough money,
had wood I myself a car by.

256
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:20,180
These are both conditional sentences 
with two clauses,

257
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,910
an if clause and the main clause.
First.

258
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:27,110
You might notice that even though I said
both languages have Vitu word order,

259
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:30,560
neither of these sentences seem to have 
verbs in the second position.

260
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:31,543
In the first clause,
the verb comes last and in the second 

261
00:15:34,071 --> 00:15:34,904
clause the verb comes first.
Well this here is the main clause or 

262
00:15:38,301 --> 00:15:41,390
independent clause.
So we should focus on this when thinking

263
00:15:41,391 --> 00:15:42,224
about Vitu word order.
If this clause alone where the entire 

264
00:15:44,691 --> 00:15:48,650
sentence than the subject would come 
first and the verb would come second,

265
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:52,400
making it Vitu word order.
This here is the dependent clause.

266
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,920
In other words,
it's not a sentence by itself.

267
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:57,380
It only adds information to the main 
clause.

268
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:58,363
So this whole dependent clause occupies 
the first position and in the main 

269
00:16:01,851 --> 00:16:02,684
clause,
the verb moves before the subject to 

270
00:16:04,461 --> 00:16:08,960
occupy second position,
making it Vitu word order first.

271
00:16:08,961 --> 00:16:11,030
We can see that the words for if are 
different.

272
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,073
Then we have the slightly different 
cognates meaning I hear we have cognate 

273
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:16,520
words,
meaning enough.

274
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,473
Notice that the vowel sound the same but
are spelled differently and notice that 

275
00:16:20,631 --> 00:16:23,870
the letter g looks the same but sounds 
different in Dutch.

276
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,733
The g sounds are Uvula fricatives ha.
Next we have the cognate words for 

277
00:16:29,031 --> 00:16:29,864
money.
The next word is an important one in 

278
00:16:31,671 --> 00:16:34,250
Dutch.
This if clause simply has the past tense

279
00:16:34,251 --> 00:16:38,180
form of the verb,
heaven meaning to have in German.

280
00:16:38,181 --> 00:16:39,014
However,
this is a subjunctive verb form 

281
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,413
something that Dutch doesn't have.
Subjunctive forms are used to express 

282
00:16:44,511 --> 00:16:45,344
hypothetical situations,
express doubt or express something you 

283
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:49,124
wish were true.
Next we see the auxiliary verbs in the 

284
00:16:51,741 --> 00:16:52,574
main clause which both translate as 
would the German word is for past 

285
00:16:56,061 --> 00:17:01,061
subjunctive form of that in and the 
Dutch word is the past tense of Xulane,

286
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:04,760
which by the way is a cognate of the 
English word Shell.

287
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:07,940
Notice that in German there's an extra 
word here.

288
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,833
This word is a reflexive pronoun which 
is used to show that you are buying 

289
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:12,614
something for yourself.
This is the data form of the first 

290
00:17:15,111 --> 00:17:16,370
person singular pronoun.

291
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:20,720
This is not completely necessary but as 
commonly used in this context.

292
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:24,380
In Standard Dutch,
the reflexive pronoun is not used here.

293
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,860
Next we have the indefinite articles 
which are cognates.

294
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,740
The German one though is the nuder 
accusative form.

295
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:33,920
While in Dutch there's only one form of 
the indefinite article.

296
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:36,350
Next,
the word for car is similar.

297
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:39,380
The Dutch word is in the common gender.
In other words,

298
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:40,243
historically masculine or feminine.
The German word is neuter gender and in 

299
00:17:43,701 --> 00:17:47,030
the accusative form,
but this form takes no special ending to

300
00:17:47,031 --> 00:17:50,700
distinguish it for some genders and it 
does and for others it doesn't.

301
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:55,400
Finally,
we see the word for by Copeland in Dutch

302
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,233
Kalfen in German,
the German consonant sound foot as a 

303
00:17:58,651 --> 00:17:59,484
result of the hydromatic consonant shift
that we talked about earlier and also 

304
00:18:02,911 --> 00:18:03,744
notice the different vowel sound.
There are a lot of similarities between 

305
00:18:07,351 --> 00:18:10,770
those two sentences we just looked at,
but there are also a lot of differences,

306
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:14,070
probably enough for you to realize that 
to a large extent,

307
00:18:14,071 --> 00:18:16,560
German and Dutch are not mutually 
intelligible.

308
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,500
For people who haven't been exposed to 
the other very much.

309
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:23,310
Words in isolation or short phrases 
might be mutually intelligible.

310
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:26,850
But when mixed in with different words 
and when spoken at full speed,

311
00:18:26,851 --> 00:18:27,684
it becomes much harder.
And just like with other pairs of 

312
00:18:29,671 --> 00:18:30,504
closely related languages,
speakers of Dutch and German often say 

313
00:18:33,091 --> 00:18:33,924
that they can understand the other 
language much more in its written form 

314
00:18:36,301 --> 00:18:39,560
than in it's spoken form.
And like I said earlier in the video,

315
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:40,423
speakers of certain dialects might have 
a much easier time understanding the 

316
00:18:43,231 --> 00:18:44,064
other language.
The question of the day for native 

317
00:18:45,811 --> 00:18:46,644
speakers of Dutch or German,
how well do you understand the other 

318
00:18:48,901 --> 00:18:51,690
language and if you've ever studied the 
other language,

319
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,553
what was your experience like and for 
other people after seeing the examples 

320
00:18:55,651 --> 00:18:56,484
in this video,
what's your impression of Dutch and 

321
00:18:57,781 --> 00:18:59,880
German?
Do they seem very similar to you?

322
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,160
Be sure to follow Lang,
focus on facebook,

323
00:19:02,161 --> 00:19:04,290
twitter and instagram.
And once again,

324
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,570
thank you to all of my patrion 
supporters,

325
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,330
especially these amazing people right 
here on the screen.

326
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,090
They are my top tier patrion supporters.
So many,

327
00:19:12,091 --> 00:19:14,730
many special thanks to them.
And to everyone else.

328
00:19:14,731 --> 00:19:17,550
Thank you for watching and have a nice 
day.
