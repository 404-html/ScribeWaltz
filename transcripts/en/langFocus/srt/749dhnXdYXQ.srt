3
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:18,230
Hello everyone.
Welcome to the Lange focus channel.

4
00:00:18,231 --> 00:00:19,270
Uh,
my name is Paul.

5
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:22,850
Today's topic is the Indonesian language
or Bahasa,

6
00:00:22,851 --> 00:00:25,820
Indonesia as it's called in Indonesian 
Indonesian,

7
00:00:25,821 --> 00:00:26,654
as closely connected with Malaya.
So if you haven't seen my video on the 

8
00:00:29,301 --> 00:00:30,134
Malay language yet,
I recommend that you watch that first 

9
00:00:31,911 --> 00:00:35,000
before you watched this video.
Indonesian is based on ballet,

10
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:38,300
though it has evolved and taken on some 
uniquely Indonesian features.

11
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:39,343
There are about 43 million native 
speakers of Indonesian and about 

12
00:00:42,021 --> 00:00:45,260
155000002nd language speakers of 
Indonesian,

13
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:46,183
mainly in Indonesia where it's the 
national language and the sole official 

14
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:49,514
language.
Why does Indonesian have so many more 

15
00:00:50,961 --> 00:00:53,120
second language speakers than native 
speakers?

16
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:54,043
Well,
there are hundreds of languages spoken 

17
00:00:55,131 --> 00:00:55,964
in Indonesia and Indonesia and functions
as a Lingua Franca between speakers of 

18
00:00:59,031 --> 00:00:59,864
different languages.
It's the language of education and of 

19
00:01:01,701 --> 00:01:04,040
media and these days everybody learns 
Indonesian,

20
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:04,903
but most Indonesians still speak a 
different regional language as their 

21
00:01:07,371 --> 00:01:09,110
native language plus Indonesia.

22
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,930
The national language.
How was the Indonesian language born?

23
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,270
Indonesian is based on the Malaya 
language,

24
00:01:14,271 --> 00:01:15,104
which has been a Lingua Franca of trade 
and of the elite throughout the Malay 

25
00:01:17,691 --> 00:01:18,524
archipelago for centuries.
The story of Indonesian begins during 

26
00:01:21,141 --> 00:01:23,810
the colonial period in the early 17th 
century.

27
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,460
The VOC or the Dutch east India company 
established a trading post at Batavia.

28
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:29,383
The site of Present Day Jakarta and over
the following three centuries expanded 

29
00:01:32,511 --> 00:01:34,460
into other areas of present day 
Indonesia.

30
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:35,503
The Dutch east India company made Molay 
the administrative language of its 

31
00:01:37,941 --> 00:01:40,180
trading outpost.
In 1799,

32
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,053
the Dutch east India company went 
bankrupt and the Dutch government took 

33
00:01:43,491 --> 00:01:46,490
control of the colony in the late 18th 
century.

34
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,360
The British east India company had also 
arrived in the archipelago and an 18,

35
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:51,203
24,
a treaty between the British and the 

36
00:01:52,401 --> 00:01:53,234
Dutch divided the area between the 
British to the north and the Dutch to 

37
00:01:55,971 --> 00:01:56,804
the south in the Dutch colony,
the promotion of the Dutch language and 

38
00:01:59,301 --> 00:02:02,330
education and Dutch began,
but only to a limited extent,

39
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,390
mostly for the elite compared to other 
colonial powers.

40
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:06,223
The Dutch were not really interested in 
changing the culture of the colonized 

41
00:02:08,751 --> 00:02:11,450
people.
Their main goal was to facilitate trade,

42
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:14,120
therefore,
since Malaya was already a Lingua Franca

43
00:02:14,121 --> 00:02:14,954
that could facilitate trade,
there was no reason for them to 

44
00:02:16,551 --> 00:02:17,384
introduce Dutch as a Lingua Franca.
The Dutch promoted Malaya as the 

45
00:02:20,241 --> 00:02:22,950
language of education,
recognizing referral molay,

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,440
the classical Malays spoken in the 
Malacca and Johor,

47
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:26,493
nate's as the standard language,
the standard form of Malaya continue to 

48
00:02:29,481 --> 00:02:31,570
develop with the abundance of Malaya 
literature.

49
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:34,100
In the 19th century into the 20th 
century,

50
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:34,963
molay linguists published dictionaries 
and grammars to further standardize and 

51
00:02:37,641 --> 00:02:38,474
modernize the language.
The Dutch language never became 

52
00:02:40,371 --> 00:02:41,990
widespread in Indonesia.
In fact,

53
00:02:41,991 --> 00:02:42,824
in 1940,
only two percent of Indonesians spoke 

54
00:02:44,841 --> 00:02:45,674
Dutch,
but even though the role of the Dutch 

55
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:47,624
language was very limited,
a large number of Dutch loan words 

56
00:02:49,821 --> 00:02:52,790
entered the Malay language in the areas 
under Dutch control,

57
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,713
and this is one of the things that made 
the Indonesian variety of Malaya 

58
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:57,470
different from other varieties.

59
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:58,423
In the early 20th century,
Pro Independence Movement arose and 

60
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:04,870
people throughout the Dutch colony began
to see themselves as a single people,

61
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:05,823
Indonesians.
The term Indonesia was a new term for 

62
00:03:07,691 --> 00:03:10,510
the archipelago created by European 
ethnologists,

63
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,373
but adopted by nationalists in the Dutch
colony at the Youth Conference of 

64
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:14,794
Nineteen Twenty eight.
Young nationalists declared the youth 

65
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:19,480
pledge with three ideals,
one motherland,

66
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:21,490
one nation,
and one language.

67
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:24,700
The language they chose was the 
Indonesian variety of Malaya,

68
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,830
which they named Bahasa,
Indonesia.

69
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,800
When Indonesia declared independence in 
1945,

70
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,890
Indonesian was declared the national 
language of the new country,

71
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:35,500
but why Indonesian?
At the time of independence,

72
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:38,920
Indonesian was the native language of 
only five percent of the population.

73
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:42,850
While Japanese was the native language 
of over 40 percent of the population.

74
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:45,970
So why wasn't Japanese chosen to be the 
national language?

75
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:46,953
Well,
that would've shown favoritism to 

76
00:03:47,681 --> 00:03:48,514
Indonesia is the largest ethnic group 
undermining the national unity of the 

77
00:03:51,161 --> 00:03:51,994
country,
but Indonesian previously known just as 

78
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:54,934
Molay had been a lingua Franca 
throughout the archipelago for 

79
00:03:57,101 --> 00:03:57,700
centuries.

80
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,970
So people in various regions of the 
country already knew some molay.

81
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:01,983
It was also a much simpler language than
Japanese and could realistically be 

82
00:04:04,631 --> 00:04:06,910
learned by millions of people as a 
second language.

83
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,890
Indonesian turned out to be the right 
choice,

84
00:04:08,891 --> 00:04:11,890
successfully becoming the language of 
government education,

85
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,220
trade and communication between people 
in different regions of the country.

86
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:18,340
Indonesian completely replaced the form 
of colonial language,

87
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:19,174
Dutch as the language of public life,
and that's something that's very rare 

88
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:22,294
and former colonies today.
Indonesian is still the second language 

89
00:04:24,701 --> 00:04:25,534
of most Indonesian people,
but it's becoming increasingly more 

90
00:04:27,611 --> 00:04:30,370
common as a native language,
especially in the cities.

91
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,520
That's because people from all over the 
country moved to the big cities,

92
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:34,443
so rather than speak their native 
regional languages that they speak 

93
00:04:36,431 --> 00:04:37,264
Indonesian instead and some of them get 
married with each other and they raised 

94
00:04:39,911 --> 00:04:42,820
their children speaking Indonesian as 
their primary language.

95
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:44,860
So what is Indonesian like?
Well,

96
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,753
undoubtedly one of the things that made 
Indonesian so successful as a national 

97
00:04:48,701 --> 00:04:49,534
language so quickly was it simplicity?
If you've seen my video on molay than 

98
00:04:52,991 --> 00:04:53,824
you're already familiar with the 
simplicity of Indonesian because in its 

99
00:04:56,261 --> 00:04:57,094
standard form it's very close to 
standard Malai just with some different 

100
00:04:59,771 --> 00:05:00,604
vocabulary.
Here are some features of Indonesian 

101
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,500
Indonesian has simple phonology.
Orthography in general,

102
00:05:05,501 --> 00:05:06,334
one letter represents just one cell.
Indonesian has simple Svo sentence 

103
00:05:09,431 --> 00:05:10,264
structure.
There are no case inflections in 

104
00:05:11,471 --> 00:05:13,420
Indonesian,
there is also no grammatical,

105
00:05:13,421 --> 00:05:14,254
gender and Indonesian.
There's no plural form and Indonesian 

106
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:18,560
and explicit plurals are made 
duplications.

107
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,593
Reduplicate,
meaning that you repeat the word again 

108
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:24,500
and perhaps best of all,
no verb conjugations.

109
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,083
Let's look at a few Indonesian sentences
and we'll identify some of those 

110
00:05:28,401 --> 00:05:29,250
features.
Sure.

111
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,760
This sentence means they are cooking 
eggs for breakfast,

112
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:38,960
word for word it.
They now cooked egg for breakfast.

113
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:42,380
We can see that this sentence is Svo.
As I said before,

114
00:05:42,381 --> 00:05:43,214
there are no verb conjugations,
so how do we know that this action is 

115
00:05:45,501 --> 00:05:46,880
happening now?
Well,

116
00:05:46,881 --> 00:05:48,890
it's because of this word right here.
Sit down.

117
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:52,280
This is an adverb that indicates that 
something is happening right now.

118
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:55,220
You can change the tense of the verb by 
changing this adverb.

119
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,113
Here's another sentence,
but it goes to the after changing the 

120
00:05:59,511 --> 00:06:00,344
word sit down to Suda.
The sentence now means they cooked eggs 

121
00:06:02,991 --> 00:06:03,824
for breakfast in the past tense.
The adverb Suda means something like 

122
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:09,350
already and shows that an action has 
been completed.

123
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:10,483
How about the future tense,
but it got kind of a must have to lose 

124
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,590
here.
ICON is the future adverb.

125
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,500
Another example,
separate.

126
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,030
Discerning,
Bulibar,

127
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:20,800
Colombo.

128
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,633
This means like me,
he often travels to loan book word for 

129
00:06:24,231 --> 00:06:25,720
word.
It's like I.

130
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:30,790
He often traveled to loan book.
Another example of Tacoma Mall.

131
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,960
Do this means do you want to sit up up 
is a yes or a no question marker,

132
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,920
so word for word it's question you want 
sit,

133
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,210
but up as often left out in speech and 
notice that to express desire.

134
00:06:44,211 --> 00:06:46,760
You can just add my own right before 
another verb.

135
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,100
The second verb doesn't change its form 
at all.

136
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,270
Another example,
Siama newly.

137
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:55,460
This means I write letters for my friend
word for word.

138
00:06:55,461 --> 00:06:56,294
It's I write a letter for friend.
I noticed that the word for letters 

139
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,400
Sudip is the same as the singular form.
Also noticed that possession is shown by

140
00:07:04,401 --> 00:07:07,850
placing a personal pronoun right after 
announcing to Mon Cya.

141
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:10,310
Literally friend.
I means my friend.

142
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,740
This makes it quite easy to form 
possessives.

143
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:17,320
Another example.
Scientists who come down.

144
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:18,643
This means,
I don't like eating peanuts word for 

145
00:07:20,391 --> 00:07:20,990
word.
It's,

146
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:21,823
I know like eat peanut,
so we negate a sentence by adding t dot 

147
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,533
before the verb,
and notice that similar to the word 

148
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,223
mouth,
which means once we can express like by 

149
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:35,150
placing the word Sukar right before 
another verb got Joan Suda.

150
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:39,470
This means the peanuts have already been
eaten word by word.

151
00:07:39,471 --> 00:07:43,280
It's peanuts already be eaten.
The icon is a passive.

152
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:46,910
Let's take a look at some of the verbs 
from the above sentences.

153
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:47,893
You can see that these Indonesian verbs 
have two parts of root in black and an 

154
00:07:51,531 --> 00:07:55,790
ethics in red Indonesian has many such 
affixes that are added to routes to make

155
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:57,320
verbs and nouns.
One example,

156
00:07:57,321 --> 00:07:58,154
the root Dooley's meaning to right,
we have to write the two lists to be 

157
00:08:03,501 --> 00:08:06,420
written that the police to be written to
listen,

158
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,160
something that's written when normally 
scan to write something down,

159
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:14,240
but no lease a writer,
but no listen the process of writing,

160
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,373
but at the least to have written on it,
but the lesson with the writing or 

161
00:08:20,271 --> 00:08:21,104
words,
you can see more examples of such 

162
00:08:22,731 --> 00:08:26,510
affixes in my video on Malave,
which functions in the same way affix is

163
00:08:26,511 --> 00:08:28,520
of the most challenging part of learning
Indonesian,

164
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,413
at least for a lot of learners,
but you can make use of that feature of 

165
00:08:31,731 --> 00:08:35,150
the roots and affixes to help you learn 
new words through their connections with

166
00:08:35,151 --> 00:08:35,810
other words.

167
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:39,290
Standard Indonesian really is a simple 
language compared to other languages,

168
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,153
but that's standard Indonesia,
which is normally used as the written 

169
00:08:42,741 --> 00:08:43,574
language and informal context.
The Way Indonesian is spoken in daily 

170
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:49,040
life is often fairly different from 
standard Indonesian,

171
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,053
different varieties of colloquial 
Indonesian or spoken around the country 

172
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:55,830
and they're influenced by the local 
native language that area,

173
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,420
these different varieties of Indonesian 
or referred to as Bahasa gold.

174
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:02,070
The Bahasa goal of Jakarta is influenced
by Battelle.

175
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:06,090
We the Malay Creole language that's 
native to Jakarta as well as by Javanese

176
00:09:06,091 --> 00:09:06,924
and Sudanese.
Since people from all over Indonesia 

177
00:09:08,641 --> 00:09:09,474
moved to Jakarta.
Let's look at the Bahasa gavel of 

178
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,340
Jakarta and see how it differs from 
standard Indonesian.

179
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:19,610
Here's a sentence we looked at before my
name now in Bahasa gold medal.

180
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,560
The first difference we see is that the 
word sit down,

181
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:28,920
which indicates present tense is like in
Bahasa gold.

182
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:32,730
Luggy is also used in standard 
Indonesian to me and again or still,

183
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,370
but it's not used as a present tense 
marker like this.

184
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:39,600
Another difference is that the verb is 
used in its root form muscle without the

185
00:09:39,601 --> 00:09:40,434
prefix.
Then we have a sound difference in the 

186
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:42,714
world to Lord,
which becomes like to lower and then 

187
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:48,270
took becomes bulla which can be used in 
standard Indonesian,

188
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,133
but the meaning is more like in order to
in Bahasa got well you can use it to 

189
00:09:51,901 --> 00:09:54,250
simply mean for,
but it got sued.

190
00:09:56,130 --> 00:10:00,170
Now in Bahasa goal,
but a code here,

191
00:10:00,171 --> 00:10:02,690
notice that the word pseudo is reduced 
to Buddha,

192
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:09,260
but got now in Bahasa gold may come back
and here,

193
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:13,410
notice that the future marker icon 
becomes buckle.

194
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:19,470
Another example,
separate these setting now in Bahasa.

195
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:21,130
Goal yet gooey.
Yes,

196
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,200
setting,
reboot and Colombo.

197
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,530
The first difference here is that the 
word solidity,

198
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:29,220
meaning like changes to Kayak.
Then notice that sale becomes Gui,

199
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,293
which is a lone word from battalion in 
beverly becomes the boot on the root is 

200
00:10:33,511 --> 00:10:35,190
the same,
but the graphics are different.

201
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:39,840
Do in this example,
we'll see two variations of Bahasa gold.

202
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:40,883
The first variation is a simple casual 
sentence going to duke that notice that 

203
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:47,040
the yes or no question marker isn't 
there.

204
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:50,770
Instead at the end you see God,
which means no in Bahasa Dell,

205
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,280
so it's like you want to sit.
No.

206
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:54,503
The second variation is used for close 
friends or people the same age as you 

207
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,340
are younger.
Lumada,

208
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:00,930
loopnet.
The second person Pronoun is loop,

209
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,240
which I believe is a lone word from 
Chinese,

210
00:11:03,241 --> 00:11:06,270
which is present in the battalion we 
creole language of Jakarta.

211
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,093
In this example,
let's look at some options for first 

212
00:11:09,811 --> 00:11:10,644
person pronouns.

213
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:16,070
Siama men who weren't really suited what
the manway in a casual,

214
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:24,120
polite sentence you use,
even in Bahasa gold in a more casual,

215
00:11:24,121 --> 00:11:25,980
familiar sentence,
aclu is used,

216
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:26,903
and when who is used as a possessive,
a shortened form is attached to the end 

217
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:33,510
of the Nell in a more intimate sentence,
grew up or way is used,

218
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:36,180
also noticed that monopolies loses its 
prefix,

219
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:38,700
but it doesn't revert to its root form 
to lease.

220
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,713
Instead,
it maintains the nasal sound at the 

221
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:41,634
beginning.
One more small difference we can see is 

222
00:11:43,381 --> 00:11:48,270
that the word for friend to mine is 
pronounced more like two men and another

223
00:11:48,271 --> 00:11:49,104
example.
Scientists who come now in Bahasa gold 

224
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:53,463
item and Kutchan again,
here we see the pronouns blew up and we 

225
00:11:56,801 --> 00:11:59,540
see that the negative to that becomes 
now,

226
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:02,740
which is related to the word God,
which we saw before,

227
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:06,350
and in Bahasa,
golden Sukkah sometimes becomes the men.

228
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:12,120
And one last example.
Now in Bahasa goal here,

229
00:12:13,331 --> 00:12:16,930
the only difference is that [inaudible] 
becomes Buddha as we saw before.

230
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:18,873
So you can see that the colloquial 
Indonesia Jakarta is fairly different 

231
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:22,624
from standard Indonesia and there are 
varieties like this spoken around the 

232
00:12:25,271 --> 00:12:26,104
country,
the influence of the other languages of 

233
00:12:27,731 --> 00:12:28,564
Indonesia on colloquial Indonesia is one
of the things that sets the language 

234
00:12:31,391 --> 00:12:32,224
apart from other varieties of Malaysian 
Indonesian is definitely a fun language 

235
00:12:35,471 --> 00:12:36,304
to study and communicating with 
Indonesians in their national language 

236
00:12:38,831 --> 00:12:41,140
and Lingua Franca is an amazing 
experience.

237
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,183
The question of the day for Indonesians,
to what extent do you speak standard 

238
00:12:45,101 --> 00:12:45,934
Indonesia and to what extent do you 
speak Bahasa goal and in what 

239
00:12:48,431 --> 00:12:49,264
situations?
Leave your comments down below and for 

240

what's been your experience 

241
00:12:53,321 --> 00:12:56,860
communicating with Indonesian people?
Do you find the standard Indonesian that

242
00:12:56,861 --> 00:12:57,694
you learn at textbooks to be useful or 
do you feel like you should be learning 

243
00:13:00,221 --> 00:13:02,110
more of the language as it's really 
spoken?

twitter and instagram.
And again,

246
00:13:06,131 --> 00:13:08,800
I'd like to say thank you very much to 
my patrion supporters,

247
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:12,220
especially the ones right here on the 
screen for their monthly pledges.

248
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:14,830
Thank you very much and have a nice day.
