00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:01,343
Hello everyone.
Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and 

2
00:00:03,151 --> 00:00:03,984
my name is Paul.
Today I'm going to talk about language 

3
00:00:06,301 --> 00:00:10,980
learning edge number five and that is 
let go of your ego.

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,320
So what do I mean by ego?
Well,

5
00:00:13,321 --> 00:00:14,154
by ego I mean that you have an image in 
mind of the way you are and an image of 

6
00:00:17,821 --> 00:00:20,400
the way that you want other people to 
see you.

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,713
In order to be successful in language 
learning and really to be successful at 

8
00:00:24,781 --> 00:00:25,614
anything,
it's really important that you don't 

9
00:00:26,761 --> 00:00:29,550
cling too tightly to your image of 
yourself.

10
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:30,863
It's important that you realize that 
your image of yourself may not 

11
00:00:33,661 --> 00:00:38,661
completely be reality.
Basically,

12
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:41,480
you need to allow yourself to be 
vulnerable.

13
00:00:41,481 --> 00:00:42,314
You can't hide yourself from situations 
that challenge your image of who you 

14
00:00:45,591 --> 00:00:46,424
are.
It's human nature to always look for 

15
00:00:47,601 --> 00:00:50,120
information that supports our image of 
who we are.

16
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,193
But in order to grow as a person,
you need to be flexible in that self 

17
00:00:54,171 --> 00:00:55,700
image,
the way you see yourself.

18
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:01,790
Let me give you one example of how your 
ego may trap you.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,833
In this example,
you have convinced yourself that you 

20
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:05,653
suck.
Let's say that you've had a bad 

21
00:01:06,921 --> 00:01:09,080
experience with language learning when 
you were in school.

22
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:09,973
Maybe you had a bad teacher,
maybe nobody taught you how to study at 

23
00:01:12,651 --> 00:01:14,220
home.
Maybe you were just a teenager,

24
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,200
preoccupied with teenagers stuff,
but you concluded that you were bad with

25
00:01:18,201 --> 00:01:19,034
languages.
You defined yourself as someone who was 

26
00:01:20,661 --> 00:01:21,494
not good with languages because you've 
defined yourself as someone who was bad 

27
00:01:25,101 --> 00:01:25,934
with languages.
You have probably ignored evidence that 

28
00:01:27,891 --> 00:01:29,090
you can be good at them.

29
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,880
Maybe you started to get some success 
with the language,

30
00:01:35,881 --> 00:01:39,390
but you gave up and you didn't know why,
or maybe you had some success,

31
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:40,224
but you gave the thanks to some external
factor to someone else or something 

32
00:01:42,931 --> 00:01:45,240
else,
so that's success didn't motivate you.

33
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:47,790
Maybe every time you had a little 
setback,

34
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,100
which everybody has,
you thought to yourself,

35
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,830
of course I have a setback.
I'm bad with languages.

36
00:01:52,831 --> 00:01:53,664
This is my fault.
Maybe that unconscious belief about 

37
00:01:55,921 --> 00:01:56,754
yourself keeps you in a trance and you 
need to snap out of it and see yourself 

38
00:02:00,301 --> 00:02:01,134
more objectively.
Recognize your successes and also know 

39
00:02:03,901 --> 00:02:08,010
that all successful people encounter 
lots of challenges and failures.

40
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:10,260
Failures and successes did not define 
you.

41
00:02:10,261 --> 00:02:13,650
They're just something that everybody 
goes through while learning a skill.

42
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,890
So I want you to evaluate your own 
beliefs about yourself.

43
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,860
If you define yourself as someone who 
has bad with languages,

44
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:23,580
expelled that belief from your mind 
expelled that idea from yourself.

45
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,680
Here's another example of how your ego 
can trap you.

46
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,633
In this example,
you are trying to convince yourself and 

47
00:02:33,651 --> 00:02:36,350
trying to convince other people that you
are amazing.

48
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,303
So let's say that you see yourself as 
someone who is great with languages or 

49
00:02:39,861 --> 00:02:40,694
as someone who is great at everything,
we're better than other people at most 

50
00:02:42,921 --> 00:02:43,754
things he does,
and you present that image to other 

51
00:02:45,621 --> 00:02:47,300
people like you want them to believe 
that,

52
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:51,440
well now you're trapped in that image as
being someone who's really good.

53
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,830
Now that might hurt your progress 
because in order to improve,

54
00:02:54,831 --> 00:02:57,710
you have to take risks.
You have to face failures,

55
00:02:57,711 --> 00:02:58,544
you have to overcome challenges,
but if you are scared to shatter that 

56
00:03:01,721 --> 00:03:02,554
perfect image of yourself,
then you're probably going to refrain 

57
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:05,644
from doing that.
You'll shy away from all of those risky 

58
00:03:07,631 --> 00:03:08,464
experiences because you want to see 
yourself and you want other people to 

59
00:03:11,081 --> 00:03:12,670
see you as already perfect.

60
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,620
Taking risks,
making mistakes,

61
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:16,900
overcoming failure,
dealing with embarrassment.

62
00:03:16,901 --> 00:03:19,810
That is all part of the learning process
for everyone,

63
00:03:19,811 --> 00:03:22,330
and if you try to skip that part of the 
learning process,

64
00:03:22,331 --> 00:03:23,164
you will not be successful.
You may have noticed that I never 

65
00:03:25,361 --> 00:03:28,300
referred to myself as a polyglot and 
there's a reason for that.

66
00:03:28,301 --> 00:03:30,250
It's because I think that using that 
word,

67
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,980
this is just me personally,
I'm not judging anyone else,

68
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,023
but when I use that word for myself,
I feel like that's creating an ego that 

69
00:03:37,271 --> 00:03:41,350
I have to be attached to.
Maybe if I call myself a polyglot than I

70
00:03:41,351 --> 00:03:43,900
will be scared to speak a language in 
front of other people.

71
00:03:43,901 --> 00:03:44,734
If I'm not fluent in it yet,
maybe I'll be worried that I'm being 

72
00:03:46,931 --> 00:03:50,050
judged for my language skills,
so I'll want to speak less.

73
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,063
I tried to avoid that kind of go a trap 
by not defining myself in terms of my 

74
00:03:54,461 --> 00:03:55,294
results.

75
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,780
I'm not a polyglot or I'm not someone 
who is amazing with languages.

76
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:02,230
I'm just someone who loves languages and
loves the learning process.

77
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,513
So in order to free yourself from any 
kind of self sabotage when it comes to 

78
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:07,414
learning languages,
I recommend that you take a look at the 

79
00:04:09,311 --> 00:04:11,710
way you define yourself in terms of 
language,

80
00:04:11,711 --> 00:04:15,790
learning your story about yourself,
make sure that your story doesn't define

81
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:17,740
you as someone who was bad with 
languages,

82
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:20,800
but on the other hand,
make sure that your story doesn't define

83
00:04:20,801 --> 00:04:22,720
you as someone who is great with 
languages.

84
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:26,530
Just define yourself as someone who can 
get the right result by taking the right

85
00:04:26,531 --> 00:04:29,980
action and dealing with all the little 
challenges along the way.

86
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,690
No more,
no less.

87
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,760
