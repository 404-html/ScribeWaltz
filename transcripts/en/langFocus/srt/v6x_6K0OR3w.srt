Hello everyone,
welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and 

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:04,223
my name is Paul.
Today's topic is Moroccan Daddy Joe 

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,480
Morocco's,
Arabic dialect,

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:10,643
or is it Moroccan deadshot is normally 
considered to belong to the Maghrebi 

5
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:15,743
Arabic dialect group,
which includes not only Moroccan Arabic 

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:18,773
but also Algerian Tunisian and how 
Arabic Moroccan dead Asia is also known 

7
00:00:23,371 --> 00:00:26,580
as the Arabic dialect,
which is the most difficult for speakers

8
00:00:26,581 --> 00:00:27,414
of other dialects to understand and the 
further you travel east away from 

9
00:00:30,481 --> 00:00:32,430
Morocco,
the more difficult it becomes.

10
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:33,593
Some Arabic speakers say that hearing 
Moroccan dead Asia is like hearing a 

11
00:00:36,781 --> 00:00:37,614
different language and some Moroccans 
insists that debt Asia is actually a 

12
00:00:40,801 --> 00:00:44,220
different language because it's 
influenced by the Amazon language.

13
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:45,383
Still other Moroccans insists that debt 
Asia is indeed Arabic and is closely 

14
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:52,290
connected with classical Arabic.
In the seventh century CE,

15
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:56,640
the Islamic conquest of the Maghreb 
region brought both Islam and the Arabic

16
00:00:56,641 --> 00:00:57,474
language to Morocco,
but before that Morocco is population 

17
00:01:00,181 --> 00:01:03,840
consisted mostly of people.
The term Berber actually.
