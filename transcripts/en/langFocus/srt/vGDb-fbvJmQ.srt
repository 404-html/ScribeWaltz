00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:05,063
Hello everyone.
Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and 

4
00:00:06,631 --> 00:00:10,380
my name is Paul and despite what half 
the people in the comments say,

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,273
English is my native language,
why doesn't he show his birth 

6
00:00:14,551 --> 00:00:16,470
certificate and you know what?
I wish he would.

7
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:18,780
He should show his birth certificate.
The other thing,

8
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:21,420
why doesn't he show his birth 
certificate?

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,590
Today's topic is 10 common mistakes that
native English speakers make.

10
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,540
When most of us study a foreign 
language,

11
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:30,090
we try to avoid mistakes and speak 
accurately.

12
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,430
Some of us are even scared to make 
mistakes,

13
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:33,323
but you know what?
Even native speakers make mistakes and 

14
00:00:35,161 --> 00:00:36,870
that includes speakers of my native 
language.

15
00:00:36,871 --> 00:00:38,460
English.
When I say mistakes,

16
00:00:38,461 --> 00:00:40,620
I'm not talking about dialectal 
variation.

17
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,680
English has various dialects that differ
from the standard language,

18
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:45,450
and I'm not talking about those 
differences.

19
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:49,140
I'm talking about native speakers of 
dialects that are very close to standard

20
00:00:49,141 --> 00:00:50,730
English,
but who make mistakes?

21
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,410
What kind of mistakes?
Well,

22
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:54,120
here are 10 of them.
Number 10,

23
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,520
unclear subject number.
For example,

24
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,980
every one of those people need to buy a 
ticket.

25
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:00,443
The correct sentence would be every one 
of those people needs to buy a ticket 

26
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,730
because the plural word people is right 
next to the verb.

27
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,770
Some people might mistake it for the 
subject,

28
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:08,813
but the subject of the sentence is 
actually every one of the people is 

29
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,120
extra information about that subject.
Everyone is singular.

30
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,040
Number nine,
confusing homophones.

31
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:17,903
When writing homophones are words that 
sound the same as other words that have 

32
00:01:20,551 --> 00:01:22,710
a different meaning and usually have a 
different spelling.

33
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:26,160
One common example is the confusion of 
effect and effect.

34
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,233
This confusion arises because the first 
vowel of each word is often reduced and 

35
00:01:30,301 --> 00:01:31,134
sounds like a Schwab and this makes them
sound like when someone's writing the 

36
00:01:33,931 --> 00:01:34,764
word,
they may be hearing the sound of the 

37
00:01:35,581 --> 00:01:36,414
word in their head and they might choose
the wrong spelling to go with that 

38
00:01:38,581 --> 00:01:39,180
sound.

39
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,013
Another example of this is they're there
and they're there and they're sound the 

40
00:01:43,591 --> 00:01:44,430
same,
but they are.

41
00:01:44,431 --> 00:01:47,550
Sounds a little different,
but in its reduced form basically sounds

42
00:01:47,551 --> 00:01:49,440
the same,
but people often choose the wrong one.

43
00:01:49,441 --> 00:01:50,274
When writing.
Another example is the confusion of 

44
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,850
your,
the possessive Pronoun with your.

45
00:01:53,851 --> 00:01:57,600
The contraction of you are.
Another example is writing of instead of

46
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:59,820
Apostrophe v,
the contracted form of,

47
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,830
for example,
someone might write,

48
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,960
I would have gone to the party if I'd 
had time,

49
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,360
but it should be would've with 
Apostrophe v.

50
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,370
They sound the same and casual 
pronunciation,

51
00:02:08,371 --> 00:02:10,260
so that's why they get confused.
Number eight,

52
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:12,930
confusion of adjectives and adverbs.
For example,

53
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:15,450
he's saying really good,
good as an adjective,

54
00:02:15,451 --> 00:02:19,110
but we need an adverb to modify the verb
sang so the correct sentences.

55
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:20,183
He sang really well.
This mistake is the mistake that kids 

56
00:02:23,221 --> 00:02:24,054
often make before they've had English 
grammar drilled into them and it's also 

57
00:02:26,431 --> 00:02:29,280
the kind of mistake that less educated 
people might make.

58
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,620
Even educated people might make this 
mistake,

59
00:02:31,621 --> 00:02:34,530
but they'd probably notice it right away
and maybe correct themselves.

60
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:35,483
Another related cases that people 
sometimes use an adverb when they 

61
00:02:37,621 --> 00:02:40,440
actually need an adjective.
So take this case for example.

62
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,140
I feel very badly about that.
The sentence is wrong.

63
00:02:43,141 --> 00:02:45,300
It should be.
I feel very bad about that,

64
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,000
but why is it wrong?
I thought adverbs modify verb,

65
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,140
well,
adverbs,

66
00:02:49,141 --> 00:02:52,200
modify action verbs,
but feel is a state of verb.

67
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:55,020
It just describes the way something is.
The state that it's in.

68
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,530
It doesn't describe an actual state of 
verbs are followed by adjectives,

69
00:02:58,531 --> 00:03:00,010
not advert.
Inevitably,

70
00:03:00,011 --> 00:03:01,930
someone will ask,
what about the sentence?

71
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:02,890
I feel.
Well,

72
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,390
isn't that correct?
Yes,

73
00:03:04,391 --> 00:03:05,224
that's a correct sentence,
but well is not an adverb in that 

74
00:03:07,241 --> 00:03:08,074
sentence.
It's actually an adjective meaning 

75
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,053
healthy.
It's not the adverb equivalent of the 

76
00:03:11,831 --> 00:03:12,670
adjective.
Good.

77
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,410
Number seven,
double negatives.

78
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,980
Most educated adults won't make this 
mistake and if they do,

79
00:03:17,981 --> 00:03:20,950
it's probably kind of an intentional 
casual style of speaking.

80
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,600
You know,
trying to sound all bad ass.

81
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:25,180
A double negative is like this.
I don't have no money,

82
00:03:25,181 --> 00:03:26,014
man.
The correct sentence would be I don't 

83
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:27,664
have any money,
man.

84
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:28,623
Another example I didn't talk to nobody 
correct sentence would be I didn't talk 

85
00:03:31,931 --> 00:03:32,764
to anybody so that one could be a 
mistake or it could be people 

86
00:03:34,721 --> 00:03:35,554
intentionally trying to copy the 
features of a dialect that's cool and 

87
00:03:38,171 --> 00:03:39,460
popular.
Number six,

88
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:43,060
not using the subjunctive mood.
Subjunctive mood as a form of the verb.

89
00:03:43,061 --> 00:03:43,894
That's used for something not factual 
like possibility or desire or a 

90
00:03:46,661 --> 00:03:49,900
necessity in English.
The subjunctive has a unique form in the

91
00:03:49,901 --> 00:03:50,734
third person present tense and the verb 
to be has a unique forum in the third 

92
00:03:53,591 --> 00:03:54,520
person past tense.

93
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:58,180
Some people just don't use it at all or 
they're confused about when to use it.

94
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,073
For example,
it's important that he goes to the 

95
00:04:00,401 --> 00:04:03,280
hospital that's actually wrong.
The correct sentence would be,

96
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,170
it's important that he go to the 
hospital.

97
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:07,660
We need the subjunctive mood here to 
show necessity.

98
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:09,910
Another example,
if I was rich,

99
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:12,550
the correct version would be if I were 
rich here,

100
00:04:12,551 --> 00:04:14,950
we need the subjunctive because it's 
showing possibility.

101
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:15,873
Number five,
confusion of is and our this confusion 

102
00:04:18,071 --> 00:04:21,700
usually happens with there is and there 
are or here is and here are.

103
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,710
For example,
here's three cookies for you.

104
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,440
The correct sentence would be,
here are three cookies for you.

105
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:27,573
Another example,
there's around seven people at the 

106
00:04:29,081 --> 00:04:29,914
party.
The correct sentence would be there are 

107
00:04:31,211 --> 00:04:33,670
around seven people at the party,
but so many people,

108
00:04:33,671 --> 00:04:34,504
even educated speakers use both of these
forms so much that I'm not even sure 

109
00:04:37,271 --> 00:04:38,830
that they're considered mistakes 
anymore.

110
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:41,740
Number for confusion,
that the verbs lie and lay.

111
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:42,783
Most native English speakers know that 
there's a difference between these 

112
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:45,484
words,
but they're kind of confused about what 

113
00:04:46,511 --> 00:04:48,640
the difference is or they know what the 
difference is,

114
00:04:48,641 --> 00:04:51,910
but they use them indirectly anyway.
Lie as an intransitive verb,

115
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:54,490
meaning it takes no direct object.
For example,

116
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,800
let's lie on the bed.
Oh boy.

117
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:59,890
I can imagine the comments already lay 
as a transitive verb,

118
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,440
meaning it takes a direct object.
For example,

119
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,410
let's lay the laundry on the bed,
but lots of people say,

120
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,273
let's lay on the bed and that's wrong.
People also mistake the past tense form 

121
00:05:10,231 --> 00:05:11,064
and the past participle of life.
I often hear people say live like he 

122
00:05:14,501 --> 00:05:18,010
lied on the floor or laid like he laid 
on the floor,

123
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,980
but really the past tense of lie is lay.
In the past.

124
00:05:20,981 --> 00:05:22,170
Participle is glade.

125
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,690
The past tense of les is late in the 
past participle.

126
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,060
There's also laid number three,
confusion of the words,

127
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:31,420
fewer and less,
fewer as used for countdowns and less is

128
00:05:31,421 --> 00:05:34,780
used for non count mountains,
but people often use less for nouns.

129
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:37,540
For example,
I eat less cookies than I used to.

130
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,553
Cookies are accountable,
so the correct sentence is I eat fewer 

131
00:05:40,601 --> 00:05:41,470
cookies.
Then I used to.

132
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:44,470
That kind of mistake is very widespread 
number too confusing.

133
00:05:44,471 --> 00:05:47,770
The past tense form and the past 
participle form of irregular verbs.

134
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:48,723
For example,
the group to go has the past tense form 

135
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:53,890
went in the past participle gone,
but lots of people say things like,

136
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:54,963
I should have went to the party,
but the correct sentence is I should've 

137
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,210
gone to the party.
Another example,

138
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:02,510
the verb to drink the past tense form is
drank in the past.

139
00:06:02,511 --> 00:06:03,740
Participle is drunk.

140
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:04,663
Some people say things like,
he's already drank two beers and it's 

141
00:06:06,621 --> 00:06:07,520
only 4:00
PM,

142
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,620
but it should be.
He's already drunk.

143
00:06:09,621 --> 00:06:11,780
Two Beers,
number one,

144
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,610
misuse of the word.
Literally.

145
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:14,683
The real original meaning of this word 
is that something in reality is exactly 

146
00:06:17,481 --> 00:06:20,090
as spoken without metaphor or 
exaggeration.

147
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:20,983
For example,
if you say she literally has thousands 

148
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:25,220
of pairs of shoes,
that means if you count all of her pairs

149
00:06:25,221 --> 00:06:26,780
of shoes,
there will be thousands of them.

150
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:28,100
Not Hundreds,
not dozens,

151
00:06:28,101 --> 00:06:31,040
but really thousands,
but these days people often use the word

152
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:34,370
literally just to put emphasis on 
something that's not actually literally,

153
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,860
for example,
that guy has literally a monster.

154
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:37,520
Oh,
really?

155
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,290
That sentence means that he looks like 
this.

156
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:41,360
He's not a human.
He's a real monster,

157
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:44,090
but that's not what they meant.
They just meant that he's a bad person.

158
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,580
This kind of mistake literally makes me 
scream,

159
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,120
what are you waiting for me to scream?

160
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,490
I don't actually scream.
I didn't mean that.

161
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,353
Literally.
I think that basically all native 

162
00:06:56,121 --> 00:06:58,520
speakers make some mistakes in writing 
and in speaking,

163
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,830
if we judge by strict grammatical 
standards,

164
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:01,693
sometimes it's because they're just 
thinking on their feet and maybe their 

165
00:07:03,591 --> 00:07:04,424
ideas aren't completely organized,
so things come out a little bit unclear 

166
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,140
and sometimes it might be a habitual 
mistake.

167
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:10,970
They repeat the same mistake over and 
over,

168
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,953
but the issue is not black and white.
Obviously standard languages need rules 

169
00:07:14,961 --> 00:07:15,794
so that there's not total chaos,
but at the same time languages are 

170
00:07:18,141 --> 00:07:18,974
always evolving and sometimes a mistake 
may be a new innovation in the language 

171
00:07:22,371 --> 00:07:25,580
that just doesn't match the rules of 
grammar yet because the rules of grammar

172
00:07:25,581 --> 00:07:26,414
would decided in the past.
So the question of the day for native 

173
00:07:28,401 --> 00:07:29,234
English speakers,
what do you think of the kind of 

174
00:07:30,081 --> 00:07:31,820
mistakes that I described in the video?

175
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:32,683
Do you think that they're a danger to 
the English language or do you see them 

176
00:07:34,641 --> 00:07:38,750
as mere innovations or does it depend on
the case and the question of the day for

177
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:41,930
native speakers of other languages,
do you notice these kinds of mistakes in

178
00:07:41,931 --> 00:07:44,120
your own native language?
What do you think of them?

179
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:46,600
Leave your comments down below.
Be sure to follow lane,

180
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,960
focus on facebook,
twitter,

181
00:07:47,961 --> 00:07:49,430

and once again,

182
00:07:49,431 --> 00:07:51,710
I'd like to say thanks to all of my 
patrion supporters,

183
00:07:51,711 --> 00:07:53,840
especially the ones right here on the 
screen for there,

184
00:07:53,841 --> 00:07:54,674
especially generous pledges.
Thank you for watching and have a nice 

185
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,140
evening.
It's like day.
