00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,240
A lot of people have been waiting for 
this video for a long time,

2
00:00:03,241 --> 00:00:06,870
so let's get right into it.
Let's talk about geeks.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,150
I am a geek.
I'm a language Geek,

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,580
but these days I'm also a video making 
geek.

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:12,743
Perhaps the most famous geeks in the 
world are Otaku people who are obsessed 

6
00:00:16,081 --> 00:00:18,840
with Japanese animation and comic book 
culture.

7
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,850
Our Mickey,
what do you want?

8
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:23,081
Sorry,
Mickey.

9
00:00:23,081 --> 00:00:25,240
I don't understand what you're saying,
so hold on a second.

10
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:32,000
Oh,
right.

11
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:39,063
Hello everyone.
Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and 

12
00:00:40,781 --> 00:00:41,614
my name is Paul.
Today's topic is the Greek language or 

13
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:47,043
as it's called in Greek.
The word Greek is a word that instantly 

14
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:53,200
brings to mind images of ancient 
civilizations and culture.

15
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:56,590
It may not be the most widely spoken 
language in the world today,

16
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,513
but it did play an extremely influential
role in the development of other 

17
00:01:00,281 --> 00:01:03,340
European languages and in European 
culture in general.

18
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:04,413
Today,
it's spoken by more than 13 million 

19
00:01:05,831 --> 00:01:06,664
native speakers,
mainly in Greece where it's the only 

20
00:01:08,681 --> 00:01:11,500
official language and a spoken by 11 
million people.

21
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,940
The Republic of Cyprus where it's spoken
by around 975,000

22
00:01:15,941 --> 00:01:18,730
people and by minorities and parts of 
Albania,

23
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:19,653
Italy and Turkey,
as well as by Greek immigrants living 

24
00:01:22,031 --> 00:01:25,510
all around the world.
Whether you realize it or not,

25
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,520
if you know English,
you know some Greek,

26
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:31,450
around 6% of the vocabulary of English 
is of Greek origin,

27
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:32,523
and some estimates reach as high as 12 
to 15% and if we look specifically at 

28
00:01:36,821 --> 00:01:37,654
the sciences and technology,
the proportion of Greek words and roots 

29
00:01:40,301 --> 00:01:41,650
skyrockets dramatically.

30
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:42,693
When you mentioned the encyclopedia,
or when you talk about physics class or 

31
00:01:45,581 --> 00:01:46,414
when you ask for the butter,
you're using words that developed from 

32
00:01:48,941 --> 00:01:52,990
Greek history,
Greek as a member of the Hellenic branch

33
00:01:52,991 --> 00:01:53,824
of the Indo European language family.
Some consider Hellenic to be a single 

34
00:01:57,431 --> 00:01:59,680
language branch consisting of only 
Greek,

35
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:00,663
while others consider some varieties of 
modern Greek to be closely related but 

36
00:02:03,851 --> 00:02:04,684
separate languages.
The development of Greek can be broken 

37
00:02:06,911 --> 00:02:10,440
down into a number of stages.
Prodo Greek protocol,

38
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:11,283
Greek or protocol,
Hellenic developed from Prodo Indo 

39
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,410
European and was probably spoken in the 
third millennium bce.

40
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,453
Over 4,000
years ago as Hellenic people migrated 

41
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:23,770
into the Belkin peninsula,
or maybe even earlier,

42
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:28,800
depending on where and when.
Prodo Indo European originated Mycenaean

43
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:32,230
Greek Mycenaean Greek is the form of 
Greek that developed in Mycenaean Greece

44
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:33,123
in the second millennium bce when the 
Greek mainland first advanced 

45
00:02:36,221 --> 00:02:39,820
civilization arose.
The earliest known Greek text comes from

46
00:02:39,821 --> 00:02:43,090
this period dating back to around 1400 
bce.

47
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,900
It's a clay tablet written in a writing 
system called linear b,

48
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,630
not the system that we know today as the
Greek alphabet.

49
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,630
The existence of such tablets makes 
Greek,

50
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:55,600
the oldest recorded living language.
To be clear,

51
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:59,320
there are older texts written in other 
languages like Sumerian,

52
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,330
Egyptian hieroglyphics,
and the KTN,

53
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:05,170
but those are all dead languages.
While Greek has lived on until today,

54
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:06,243
sometime toward the end of the Mycenaean
Greek stage or in the early part of the 

55
00:03:09,521 --> 00:03:12,730
ancient Greek stage,
the Greek alphabet was adopted.

56
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:17,710
The date of adoption is around 1100 bce 
plus or minus a couple of hundred years.

57
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,573
We're not quite sure.
The Greek alphabet was derived from the 

58
00:03:20,831 --> 00:03:24,730
Phoenician alphabet with Greek adopting 
and modifying the finish and letters,

59
00:03:24,731 --> 00:03:27,250
and generally keeping similar sounds for
each one.

60
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,293
There are also several unique Greek 
letters that did not derive from 

61
00:03:30,701 --> 00:03:31,534
Phoenician.
You may notice that some of the symbols 

62
00:03:33,491 --> 00:03:37,570
are reversed that might be explained by 
the fact that physician was written from

63
00:03:37,571 --> 00:03:40,390
right to left while Greek is written 
from left to right.

64
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,273
At first,
there were numerous local varieties of 

65
00:03:43,751 --> 00:03:44,584
the Greek alphabet,
but the standard 24 letter Greek 

66
00:03:46,691 --> 00:03:49,810
alphabet became widespread throughout 
the Greek speaking world.

67
00:03:49,811 --> 00:03:54,510
During the fourth century bce in Cyprus,
a different script called the Cypriots.

68
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,353
Syllabary was used between the 11th and 
fourth centuries bce when the Greek 

69
00:03:58,991 --> 00:04:01,600
alphabet was finally adopted,
the Greek alphabet.

70
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:04,390
What eventually give rise to numerous 
other alphabets,

71
00:04:04,391 --> 00:04:06,940
including the Latin Alphabet,
the Coptic Alphabet,

72
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:10,630
but the Cyrillic alphabet and the Gothic
alphabet ancient Greek.

73
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,583
The adoption of the Greek alphabet took 
place around the beginning of the 

74
00:04:13,961 --> 00:04:14,794
ancient Greek stage of the language,
which lasted from about the ninth 

75
00:04:17,531 --> 00:04:20,410
century bce until the fourth century 
bce.

76
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:21,543
This stage of the language corresponds 
to the archaic and classical periods of 

77
00:04:24,611 --> 00:04:28,720
Greek history,
the oldest existing Greek literature and

78
00:04:28,721 --> 00:04:31,960
indeed some of the oldest western 
literature dates from this period,

79
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,440
including the two epic poems,
the Iliad and the Odyssey,

80
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,000
which are attributed to homer.

81
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,730
There were various dialects of ancient 
Greek at the time,

82
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:43,300
including attic,
the dialect of Athens as well as ionic.

83
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,150
These epic poems were written in homeric
Greek,

84
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:50,530
a literary form of the language based on
the ionic dialect of Greek with elements

85
00:04:50,531 --> 00:04:54,640
of some other dialects during the 
classical period of Greek history.

86
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:55,623
More texts of tremendous importance to 
Western civilization were written in 

87
00:04:58,781 --> 00:05:01,270
ancient Greek,
including the works of Socrates,

88
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,800
Plato,
and Aristotle,

89
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,740
and many texts of foundational 
importance in logic,

90
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:06,603
math and science.
Cornay Greek with the conquest of 

91
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,760
Alexander the Great.
In the fourth century bce,

92
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:17,190
the Greek language became widespread in 
a form known as Koine Greek Qa,

93
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:18,024
meaning common.
It was based mainly on the attic and 

94
00:05:20,681 --> 00:05:23,530
ionic dialects with some elements of 
others as well,

95
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:26,560
and it served as a Lingua Franca 
throughout the conquered regions.

96
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,980
It was spoken most widely in the eastern
Mediterranean region.

97
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,120
A large amount of important literature 
was written in Koine Greek,

98
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,610
including the new testament and the 
septuagint,

99
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:37,653
the Greek translation of the Old 
Testament Koininia Greek remains the 

100
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,183
Lingua Franca of the eastern 
Mediterranean region during the Roman 

101
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:45,363
Empire,
and became the official language of the 

102
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:51,400
Byzantine Empire until the 15th century 
medieval Greek medieval Greek,

103
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:52,323
also known as Byzantine Greek,
developed from Koine Greek during the 

104
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:56,260
Byzantine Empire.

105
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,850
During this period,
the spoken language based on coin,

106
00:05:58,851 --> 00:06:01,610
a Greek began to develop towards modern 
Greek.

107
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,593
Wow.
Written Greek tended to be more 

108
00:06:03,501 --> 00:06:07,280
conservative and similar to ancient 
Greek modern Greek.

109
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:11,630
The end of the Byzantine Empire marks 
the beginning of the modern Greek period

110
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,720
during the modern Greek period,
two forms of Grieco rose.

111
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:19,790
The first was demotic or Zemo Tki,
which means by the people.

112
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:22,460
This is the modern spoken form of the 
Greek language.

113
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:23,323
The second was a literary form of Greek 
with features of both demotic Greek and 

114
00:06:28,251 --> 00:06:31,190
ancient Greek.
This resulted in a state of dye glossier

115
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,053
with the spoken language and the formal 
written language being significantly 

116
00:06:35,031 --> 00:06:35,864
different until the adoption of demotic 
as the official language of Greece in 

117
00:06:39,081 --> 00:06:43,970
1976 that form of demotic is referred to
as standard modern Greek.

118
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,520
There are several dialects of modern 
Greek as well.

119
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,240
Northern dialect,
Ionian,

120
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:52,340
Peloponnesian dialects,
southern dialects is that Konijn all the

121
00:06:52,341 --> 00:06:53,174
Athenian,
and there's also the Cypriot dialect 

122
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,610
spoken on the island of Cyprus with one 
exception,

123
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,530
the endangered saccone and dialect.

124
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,530
All forms of modern Greek developed from
Koine Greek.

125
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:07,190
Despite this long history and it's 
different stages of development,

126
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,083
the Greek language has changed 
relatively little compared to other 

127
00:07:10,401 --> 00:07:11,234
languages during the same timeframe.
My understanding is that speakers of 

128
00:07:14,241 --> 00:07:15,074
modern Greek can look at an ancient 
Greek text and recognize a lot of 

129
00:07:18,081 --> 00:07:20,420
familiar vocabulary,
a lot of familiar words,

130
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:23,030
even if they can't make sense of the 
sentence itself.

131
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,013
This relative lack of change in the 
language is probably the result of 

132
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:31,010
ancient Greeks continued influence on 
written Greek throughout the centuries.

133
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:31,993
So what is Greek like?
Let's examine some of the features of 

134
00:07:34,671 --> 00:07:37,490
Greek,
specifically modern Greek syntax.

135
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:41,950
There's disagreement over whether Greeks
default word order is Svo or V,

136
00:07:41,951 --> 00:07:45,290
s o,
but the most common word order is Svo.

137
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:46,490
Look at this sentence here

138
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,760
in the Smi Lama in Unica,

139
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,630
this sentence means we speak Greek.
Here's the subject,

140
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:55,120
the verb and the object.
But in Greek,

141
00:07:55,121 --> 00:07:57,340
the subject Pronoun is not always 
necessary.

142
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,430
Neelam aliens.

143
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:00,813
The subject pronouns isn't necessary 
here because we know from the verb 

144
00:08:03,341 --> 00:08:05,770
conjugation that this is the first 
person plural.

145
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:06,913
So if the subject Pronoun is typically 
used when you want to draw attention to 

146
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:10,624
it or make it the topic of the sentence,
despite Svo being the most common word 

147
00:08:14,261 --> 00:08:15,094
order in Greek,
the words can actually be arranged in 

148
00:08:16,661 --> 00:08:17,494
different ways.
Usually to put focus on one element of 

149
00:08:19,811 --> 00:08:23,140
the sentence.
Here's a sentence that means niece loves

150
00:08:23,141 --> 00:08:23,974
Maria.

151
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,380
Oh,
young niece Maria.

152
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:27,523
This sentence here is Svo and notice 
that the definite article comes before 

153
00:08:30,741 --> 00:08:31,580
proper names.

154
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:34,510
Maria [inaudible]

155
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:36,760
this time it's Oh v S

156
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:40,120
oh young is demaria of a pie.

157
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:44,350
This time it's s o.
V.

158
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:44,590
See Maria

159
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,000
[inaudible]

160
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:50,210
this time it's o s v.
These three word orders.

161
00:08:50,211 --> 00:08:53,660
Here are all ways of drawing focus to 
the object of the sentence.

162
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:57,630
It's possible to change the order of the
words like this because grammatical case

163
00:08:57,631 --> 00:09:01,290
inflections tell us the nouns function 
even if it's in a different location.

164
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,020
There are four grammatical cases in 
Greek,

165
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,580
nominative,
genitive,

166
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,380
accusative,
and Vocativ.

167
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,930
Incentives is like these with proper 
names.

168
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:12,390
The names themselves don't have case 
inflections,

169
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:16,230
but the definite articles do notice that
the two definite articles or different,

170
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:17,363
we'll come back to that in a minute.
Let's look at another sentence and see 

171
00:09:19,771 --> 00:09:21,240
the nouns.
Case inflection.

172
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,370
This sentence means I lost my new 
glasses word for word.

173
00:09:28,371 --> 00:09:31,940
It's lost I,
which we know from the inflection,

174
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:36,530
the new glasses,
my this word,

175
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:41,330
which means glasses is an inflected form
of the neuter Noun,

176
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:45,020
which means glass.
It's the nominative,

177
00:09:45,021 --> 00:09:47,810
accusative and Vocativ plural form.
Yes,

178
00:09:47,811 --> 00:09:50,120
it can be all three of those.
Also,

179
00:09:50,121 --> 00:09:50,954
the definite article is inflected to 
agree with the now this is the nuture 

180
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:54,963
nominative,
accusative plural form of the definite 

181
00:09:56,781 --> 00:09:57,900
article.
As you can see,

182
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:00,500
there are several other forms of the 
definite article too.

183
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:03,080
Let's go back to an earlier sentence.
For a second.

184
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,393
This definite article here before young 
niece is in the masculine singular 

185
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,533
nominative form and this definite 
article here before Maria is in the 

186
00:10:12,231 --> 00:10:16,340
feminine singular accusative form.
Even when the word order changed,

187
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:20,420
the definite article stayed the same.
Allowing us to know which person was the

188
00:10:20,421 --> 00:10:21,254
subject,
the nominative case and which one was 

189
00:10:23,271 --> 00:10:25,460
the object,
the accusative case.

190
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:26,923
Also the adjective is inflected to agree
with the now this is the nuder 

191
00:10:29,841 --> 00:10:31,010
nominative,
accusative,

192
00:10:31,011 --> 00:10:31,844
vocativ plural form.
Now let's change the noun in the 

193
00:10:34,581 --> 00:10:36,110
sentence and see what happens.

194
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:40,323
This means I lost my new dog this time.
The Noun is inflected to show the 

195
00:10:43,871 --> 00:10:44,704
masculine singular accusative form.
The definite article is also in the 

196
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:51,940
masculine singular accusative form and 
so as the adjective.

197
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,253
The main thing I want you to notice here
is that the now but also the words that 

198
00:10:55,841 --> 00:10:56,674
come together with the now like the 
definite article and the adjective 

199
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,790
change form to showcase,
but also gender and number verbs.

200
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,390
Greek verbs have two different stems,
two different forms.

201
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:08,403
One to show perfect mood,
which means an action is complete and 

202
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:15,160
one to show imperfect mood,
which means an action is incomplete.

203
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,173
Then various affixes particles and 
auxiliary verbs are added to these two 

204
00:11:19,451 --> 00:11:22,090
stems to show past tense and non past 
tense.

205
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,013
Let's examine the meaning to help.
This is the perfect stem showing 

206
00:11:26,091 --> 00:11:30,500
completed action Wli thesis,
and this is the imperfect stem.

207
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:35,780
Now let's look at how to create some 
verb tenses based on these stems.

208
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:36,643
Here's the present tense voice.
This means I am helping my friend and 

209
00:11:41,361 --> 00:11:44,300
this could also mean I helped my friend.
In a general sense,

210
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:48,290
the present tense form is based on the 
imperfect stem because the action is not

211
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:49,850
complete yet it's happening.
Now,

212
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:52,390
here's the imperfect tense,
very suicidal.

213
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,650
This means I was helping my friend or I 
used to help my friend.

214
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,170
Again,
this form is based on the imperfect stem

215
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:03,530
because the action was continuing at a 
certain point in the past.

216
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,510
Now here's the simple past

217
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,470
[inaudible].

218
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:08,543
This means I helped my friend.
The simple past is based on the perfect 

219
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,860
verb stem because the action is 
complete.

220
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,260
Future

221
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,970
Savoy.
You see sort of feeling

222
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:21,520
this means I will help my friend.
The simple future tense is also based on

223
00:12:21,521 --> 00:12:24,760
the perfect stem because it's an action 
with a start and a finish.

224
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:28,660
It's not a continuing action and the 
present perfect

225
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:31,960
cc [inaudible] Flores.

226
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,780
This means I have helped my friend many 
times,

227
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:38,080
the present perfect.
It's also based on the perfect stem,

228
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,740
as you might've guessed from its name,
because the action has been done at some

229
00:12:41,741 --> 00:12:45,010
point in the past.
Also notice the auxiliary verb,

230
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:47,830
which is the first person singular form 
of the verb,

231
00:12:47,831 --> 00:12:48,664
meaning to have.
Let's look at one final Greek sentence 

232
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:52,630
and see what we discover

233
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:57,430
in this [inaudible].

234
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,240
The sentence means we fell in love and 
got married.

235
00:13:00,241 --> 00:13:01,830
Immediately.
Word for word it.

236
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,440
We fall in love,
past tense.

237
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,550
First person,
plural,

238
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:08,430
inflection and get married.
Past tense.

239
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:09,600
First person,
plural.

240
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:11,610
Immediately.
This verb,

241
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:14,130
it'll tell them it means to fall in 
love.

242
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:19,370
This verb means to get married.
This ending is the first person,

243
00:13:19,621 --> 00:13:21,330
plural,
past tense conjugation.

244
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:25,320
This piece here show us past tense and 
this piece shows number and person.

245
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:30,000
These two verbs are not active verbs but
rather medio passive verbs.

246
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:33,210
You might see the word passive there and
think that these are passive verbs,

247
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,850
but medio passive verbs are not always 
passive.

248
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:39,390
They might also be intransitive or 
reflexive or reciprocal.

249
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:41,460
In this case,
they seem to be reciprocal,

250
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:45,120
meaning that both people are doing the 
action to each other or with each other.

251
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:49,470
This ending here on the dictionary form 
of the verb is a hint that it's a medial

252
00:13:49,471 --> 00:13:50,304
passive verb.

253
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,473
One of the main things you may have 
noticed about Greek is that it's a 

254
00:13:53,641 --> 00:13:54,474
highly inflected language with lots of 
different word forms and lots of 

255
00:13:57,061 --> 00:13:57,894
different endings that can attach to 
nouns and to verb stems and that might 

256
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:01,674
seem kind of intimidating,
but there are lots of languages out 

257
00:14:03,961 --> 00:14:06,210
there that are much more inflected then 
Greek,

258
00:14:06,211 --> 00:14:07,044
so please don't be scared of that.
The story of the Greek language is a 

259
00:14:09,601 --> 00:14:10,434
very long and spectacular one and 
there's so much to say about Greek that 

260
00:14:13,021 --> 00:14:13,854
we can't fit into this video,
but hopefully you were a little bit 

261
00:14:15,871 --> 00:14:19,920
inspired to learn more about Greek.
One of the oldest languages in the world

262
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:24,270
and a language that has influenced many 
other languages and the very foundations

263
00:14:24,271 --> 00:14:26,880
of Western civilization and thought,
okay,

264
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:29,790
the question of the day to native 
speakers of Greek,

265
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,970
how well can you understand written 
Greek from the past,

266
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,170
like Koine Greek and ancient Greek,
and to people who have studied Greek?

267
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:40,530
What did you find challenging and not so
challenging about Greek?

268
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:42,960
Be sure to follow length,
focus on facebook,

269
00:14:42,961 --> 00:14:44,250
twitter,
and instagram.

270
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,293
And as always,
I would like to say thank you to all of 

271
00:14:46,801 --> 00:14:47,634
my wonderful patrion supporters,
especially these people right here on 

272
00:14:50,311 --> 00:14:52,310
the screen for their monthly pledges.

273
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:55,130
Thank you for watching and have a nice 
day.
