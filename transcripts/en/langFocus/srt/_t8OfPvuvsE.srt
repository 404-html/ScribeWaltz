00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:00,983
Hello everyone.
Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and 

2
00:00:02,821 --> 00:00:06,390
my name is Paul today.
This is not a feature video.

3
00:00:06,391 --> 00:00:07,224
This is just a special video in which 
I'm going to make a little announcement 

4
00:00:09,601 --> 00:00:13,230
and then I'm going to answer some 
frequently asked questions that a lot of

5
00:00:13,231 --> 00:00:17,640
people ask me in the comments of videos 
and also in private messages.

6
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:18,653
So the first announcement that I want to
make is that I have created a patriotic 

7
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:23,483
account.
Now maybe you don't know what Patrion 

8
00:00:25,141 --> 00:00:25,974
is.
Patrion is a service that allows you to 

9
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:28,763
basically support your favorite youtube 
creators by pledging to give them a 

10
00:00:32,521 --> 00:00:36,720
certain amount of money each month and 
amount of money that you decide.

11
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,320
Now I want to say right away,
you don't have to do this.

12
00:00:40,321 --> 00:00:41,154
You don't have to give any money.
This is basically like a voluntary 

13
00:00:44,101 --> 00:00:46,800
subscription feed that you can pay if 
you want,

14
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,790
but the amount is up to you so it can be
as little as $1.

15
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:51,623
That's one of the cool things about 
Patrion is that everyone can give just 

16
00:00:54,601 --> 00:00:55,950
$1,
not everyone,

17
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:56,843
but if you want,
you can give $1 and if a lot of people 

18
00:00:59,071 --> 00:00:59,904
give $1,
then that amount of money kind of adds 

19
00:01:01,621 --> 00:01:03,210
up in the creator gets,
you know,

20
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,430
a significant amount.
So that's the cool thing about it.

21
00:01:05,431 --> 00:01:09,750
It's kind of a collective way to support
your favorite creators as a team.

22
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:10,703
So the reason I'm doing that is because 
I've put in a lot of time and effort 

23
00:01:13,591 --> 00:01:14,424
into making the videos and basically 
that's a lot of time that I could be 

24
00:01:17,401 --> 00:01:20,220
putting into different work that pay 
money.

25
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,280
I do get a little bit of money from some
advertising on youtube,

26
00:01:23,281 --> 00:01:26,070
but it's just a small amount.
It's not really a lot,

27
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:28,740
uh,
because according to my statistics,

28
00:01:28,741 --> 00:01:32,370
about 70% of people use ad blockers and 
that's okay.

29
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:34,770
I don't really mind if you do that.
That's up to you.

30
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,690
Of course,
this is all voluntary.

31
00:01:36,691 --> 00:01:39,570
If you want to support the channel,
Patrion is a way to do that.

32
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:42,030
Even if you like to use an ad blocker or
whatever,

33
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:42,893
things like that.
Basically have a look at the Patrion 

34
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:45,773
page that I've created.
If you think that Lang focus deserves a 

35
00:01:48,601 --> 00:01:49,434
little donation every month,
a dollar or whatever you want to give 

36
00:01:51,481 --> 00:01:53,610
them,
that would be highly appreciated.

37
00:01:53,611 --> 00:01:54,444
But if not,
then don't worry about it because I'll 

38
00:01:55,981 --> 00:01:56,814
still love you just as much.
She'll still be a valued viewer and all 

39
00:01:59,941 --> 00:02:01,620
of that,
so don't even stress about it.

40
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:02,543
It's completely voluntary.
And the link to that Patrion page is 

41
00:02:05,461 --> 00:02:06,294
down below in the description.
So onto a few frequently asked 

42
00:02:09,901 --> 00:02:10,734
questions.
So the first frequently asked question 

43
00:02:12,451 --> 00:02:13,111
is,
Paul,

44
00:02:13,111 --> 00:02:15,120
how many languages do you speak?

45
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,750
Now this is a strange question to be 
asked because it kind of feels like,

46
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:19,763
because I'm making the videos that 
people think I'm a language master or a 

47
00:02:22,771 --> 00:02:26,670
language guru or one of those things,
and I don't think of myself like that.

48
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:27,523
I don't think I'm a language master.
I'm just someone who's very passionate 

49
00:02:30,031 --> 00:02:32,010
about languages and very interested in 
them.

50
00:02:32,011 --> 00:02:35,460
And I'm also very passionate about 
learning because the teacher,

51
00:02:35,461 --> 00:02:36,294
but also I just love learning.
But I know why people are asking that 

52
00:02:38,941 --> 00:02:41,040
question.
So I'll try to give you my answer.

53
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:42,720
I'll,
I'll tell you which language is that.

54
00:02:42,721 --> 00:02:45,750
I've basically invested a lot of time 
into studying that.

55
00:02:45,751 --> 00:02:46,584
I've studied in depth in that I have a 
significant amount of knowledge of it 

56
00:02:49,471 --> 00:02:51,780
doesn't mean I'm really advanced that 
those languages,

57
00:02:51,781 --> 00:02:54,600
but it means I put that time and effort 
into them.

58
00:02:54,601 --> 00:02:58,260
So the first one that I studied back in 
the day was Hebrew.

59
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,273
In University I studied biblical Hebrew,
but in my free time I also studied 

60
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:04,720
modern Hebrew.
I also studied biblical,

61
00:03:04,721 --> 00:03:05,554
Aramaic and university and at the same 
time I studied old English or Anglo 

62
00:03:08,501 --> 00:03:09,334
Saxon.
So we can throw that in there and it's 

63
00:03:10,421 --> 00:03:12,670
not a spoken language,
but I'll throw that in there.

64
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:13,863
I've also studied Arabic,
I studied modern standard Arabic and 

65
00:03:16,181 --> 00:03:17,014
also some Arabic dialects,
specifically Palestinian and to some 

66
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:23,830
extent Egyptian as well.
I've also of course studied Japanese.

67
00:03:23,831 --> 00:03:24,664
As you might know,
I live in Japan and I've been studying 

68
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,920
Japanese for a long time.
I've also studied Indonesian.

69
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:33,250
I've also studied French.
I've also studied tagalog.

70
00:03:33,251 --> 00:03:37,690
I've also studied Esperanto and I've 
also recently been studying Italian.

71
00:03:37,691 --> 00:03:38,524
So those are the ones I've really put 
time and effort into studying quite a 

72
00:03:41,501 --> 00:03:43,360
lot.
I don't know if I'm forgetting any,

73
00:03:43,361 --> 00:03:45,460
but uh,
that's probably the main ones.

74
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:48,100
There are other languages that I've 
studied to a basic level,

75
00:03:48,101 --> 00:03:50,920
but I don't really know them enough to 
say that I know them.

76
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,530
And there are some languages that I can 
also read.

77
00:03:53,531 --> 00:03:57,010
Like I have passive knowledge of them 
because I've studied related languages,

78
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:00,160
but I've never specifically studied 
those languages themselves.

79
00:04:00,161 --> 00:04:02,410
So for example,
Portuguese and Spanish,

80
00:04:02,411 --> 00:04:03,244
I can,
I can often make sense to them when I'm 

81
00:04:04,601 --> 00:04:06,580
reading them,
but I've never studied them.

82
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:07,653
There are also other languages that I've
just studied from a linguistic point of 

83
00:04:10,271 --> 00:04:11,104
view.
Like I want to see how those languages 

84
00:04:12,281 --> 00:04:13,114
work.
So I examined them and sometimes the 

85
00:04:14,411 --> 00:04:17,080
language profile videos I make are kind 
of like that.

86
00:04:17,081 --> 00:04:19,120
Like I'm just interested in those 
languages.

87
00:04:19,121 --> 00:04:22,390
So I examine them and study and learn 
about those languages.

88
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:24,850
But I haven't necessarily studied those 
languages.

89
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,540
Basically I consider myself a language,
enthusiasm,

90
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:28,930
someone who loves languages.

91
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:29,973
I don't call myself a polyglot.
I'm not going to make a video called 

92
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:35,720
Canadian guys speaks 25 languages or 
something like that.

93
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:38,050
Like that's not really the purpose of 
this channel.

94
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,950
That channel is called Lang focus 
because I want to focus on the languages

95
00:04:41,951 --> 00:04:42,784
and not really on me and my own ability.
Another frequently asked question I get 

96
00:04:46,301 --> 00:04:47,980
is Paul,
what do you do for a living?

97
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,930
Is it related to languages?
Well,

98
00:04:49,931 --> 00:04:50,950
yes,
kind of a,

99
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:51,863
I'm an instructor at a university and I 
teach English as a foreign language to 

100
00:04:55,511 --> 00:04:56,344
students in Japan.
So originally part of the reason I made 

101
00:04:58,721 --> 00:04:59,554
the length focus channel was kind of to 
inspire my students so I have some 

102
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:03,094
videos to show them and I could show 
them that my hobby is language learning 

103
00:05:06,071 --> 00:05:09,730
and I could give them some extra 
motivation to work hard to study English

104
00:05:09,731 --> 00:05:10,564
because they could see that their 
teacher is doing that to another 

105
00:05:13,061 --> 00:05:17,020
frequently asked question I get is Paul,
what's your educational background?

106
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,150
Well,
I have two university degrees.

107
00:05:19,151 --> 00:05:24,010
My first university degree was in 
English with a linguistics focus.

108
00:05:24,011 --> 00:05:24,844
So it wasn't a literature degree.
It was a linguistics degree in the 

109
00:05:27,131 --> 00:05:27,964
English department.
So that means I studied the history of 

110
00:05:30,281 --> 00:05:32,170
English,
I studied English grammar,

111
00:05:32,171 --> 00:05:33,004
I studied English phonology,
I studied a dialectal differences in 

112
00:05:36,131 --> 00:05:36,964
English.
I studied all of those kinds of things 

113
00:05:38,381 --> 00:05:42,070
about the English language.
I also had a minor in religious studies.

114
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:42,933
Basically all of my credits that went 
towards that minor where courses in 

115
00:05:46,391 --> 00:05:47,224
biblical Hebrew and Biblical Aramaic.
I wanted to study those languages and I 

116
00:05:50,381 --> 00:05:51,214
figured out that I could get a minor in 
religious studies by just taking those 

117
00:05:54,431 --> 00:05:55,630
courses.
So that's what I did.

118
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:59,450
I also have a second university degree 
that one is in education.

119
00:05:59,451 --> 00:06:00,284
So after I finished my first degree,
I went back to university and did a 

120
00:06:02,691 --> 00:06:06,860
second degree in education and that's 
what allows me to be a teacher and do my

121
00:06:06,861 --> 00:06:10,340
current job at the university.
So let's just a little bit about me.

122
00:06:10,341 --> 00:06:11,174
It seems like some of the viewers want 
to get to know a little bit more about 

123
00:06:13,731 --> 00:06:15,680
me personally.
If you're one of those people,

124
00:06:15,681 --> 00:06:19,220
you can check out my instagram too,
like gives you a little bit of a glimpse

125
00:06:19,221 --> 00:06:20,990
into my life,
my daily life,

126
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,093
and you can follow me on facebook as 
well and all of those different social 

127
00:06:25,071 --> 00:06:27,770
media channels.
So thank you for watching.

128
00:06:27,771 --> 00:06:28,940
Have a nice day.
