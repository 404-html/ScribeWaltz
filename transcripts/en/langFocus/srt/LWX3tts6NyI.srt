1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,850
Yeah,

2
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:12,840
good evening and welcome to the Lange 
focus channel.

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,860
This is a quick video to bring you some 
breaking news from the linguistic world.

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,200
According to recently released 
documents,

5
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:20,063
the European Union will soon be adopting
Esperanto as an official language for 

6
00:00:24,001 --> 00:00:27,180
those who don't know,
Esperanto is a constructed language that

7
00:00:27,181 --> 00:00:30,860
was created in the 18 slash 17 by Dr ll 
Zimmerman Hoff.

8
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:35,670
It was created in order to function as 
an international auxiliary language that

9
00:00:35,671 --> 00:00:36,504
people all around the world can learn 
and it was intentionally designed to be 

10
00:00:39,361 --> 00:00:40,194
extremely easy to learn,
but Esperanto never fully caught on and 

11
00:00:42,871 --> 00:00:45,240
remained mostly a hobby for language 
nerds.

12
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:47,550
Until now.
According to EU officials,

13
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:48,443
Esperanto will be designated the 25th 
official language of the European Union 

14
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,033
and will function as a working language 
of the European Parliament as well as a 

15
00:00:56,221 --> 00:00:59,880
procedural language of the European 
Commission in addition to English,

16
00:00:59,881 --> 00:01:00,780
French,
and German.

17
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:01,823
The EU is also expected to soon 
recommend that all member states begin 

18
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:08,970
drafting plans for public school 
educational programs in Esperanto.

19
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:09,923
The unofficial word on the street is 
that with the coming departure of the 

20
00:01:12,481 --> 00:01:14,250
UK,
from the European Union,

21
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,173
enthusiasm for learning English is 
declining and Esperanto is a viable 

22
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:22,530
longterm option to replace English as 
the international language.

23
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,680
This new European Union policy will 
begin on April 30,

24
00:01:25,681 --> 00:01:26,514
first 2017.
This is wonderful news for Esperanto 

25
00:01:29,491 --> 00:01:31,620
lovers all around the world.
The Esperanza,

26
00:01:31,621 --> 00:01:35,370
this dream of uniting the world with one
language is one step closer.

27
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:36,443
Please leave your comments in support of
Esperanza in the comment section down 

28
00:01:39,331 --> 00:01:42,840

European Union initiative.

important breaking news lang focus.
