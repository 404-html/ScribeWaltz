1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,310
What was today's topic?
I forgot.

2
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:07,923
Oh,
right.

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:11,750
Hebrew.
No.

4
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:13,250
Uh,
Arabic.

5
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:20,383
Hm.

6
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:21,881
Oh,
right.

7
00:00:21,881 --> 00:00:23,230
I've heard of that one.
What was it?

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,720
Uh,
American.

9
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:26,423
Okay.

10
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:31,343
Hello everyone.
Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and 

11
00:00:33,331 --> 00:00:37,710
my name is Paul.
Today's topic is the m horic language or

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,753
Ahmadinia as it's known in Amharic.
I'm Horak is one of the major languages 

13
00:00:42,841 --> 00:00:43,674
of Ethiopia and it's the official 
working language of the Ethiopian 

14
00:00:46,861 --> 00:00:47,694
federal government.
Regional and local authorities are free 

15
00:00:50,251 --> 00:00:52,320
to choose their working language in 
Ethiopia,

16
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,990
but I'm horic is the working language of
several regions.

17
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:55,943
According to the 2007 census,
it's the native language of 22 million 

18
00:01:00,031 --> 00:01:04,350
people or around 30% of the population 
of 74 million.

19
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,520
But over the last 10 years,
the population of Ethiopia is thought to

20
00:01:08,521 --> 00:01:09,354
have surpassed 100 million.
And the number of native Amharic 

21
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:13,223
speakers is probably over 30 million.
But Ethiopia is a country where many 

22
00:01:16,981 --> 00:01:17,814
people are multilingual and millions.
More people speak Amharic as a second 

23
00:01:20,941 --> 00:01:23,220
language,
especially in cities and towns.

24
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:27,180
Am horic is a member of the Semitic 
language family,

25
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,670
which also includes Hebrew,
Arabic,

26
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,670
Aramaic,
and the t gray and too granule languages

27
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:37,700
which are spoken in Ethiopia and Eritrea
all Semitic languages developed from the

28
00:01:37,771 --> 00:01:39,780
theoretic Prodo Semitic language.

29
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,480
The ethiopic or ECO Semitic languages 
are part of the South Semitic branch and

30
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:46,314
the most common theory is that all Ethio
Semitic languages including I'm 

31
00:01:49,281 --> 00:01:50,114
horrific,
developed from a common Prato Ethio 

32
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:53,723
Semitic language.
This Prato Ethio Semitic language is 

33
00:01:55,471 --> 00:01:56,304
thought to have developed from the 
language of migrants from Southern 

34
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,920
Arabia,
presumably old south Arabian languages.

35
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:02,933
These migrants intermixed with the 
native people who spoke who schick 

36
00:02:05,521 --> 00:02:10,521
languages and Prodo Ethio Semitic arose.
This language was a direct descendant of

37
00:02:10,981 --> 00:02:14,910
the language of the migrants from this 
protal Ethio Semitic language.

38
00:02:14,911 --> 00:02:17,160
Two branches developed the southern 
branch,

39
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:19,620
which includes I'm horic and the 
northern branch,

40
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:22,590
which includes t gray to [inaudible] and
gaze,

41
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:23,453
the oldest attested Ethio Semitic 
language and the one that became the 

42
00:02:26,281 --> 00:02:27,114
official language of the [inaudible] 
empire and remained the official 

43
00:02:29,971 --> 00:02:33,060
literary language in Ethiopia until the 
19th century.

44
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:37,140
Some believe in that theory of migration
from Southern Arabia.

45
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,153
But some believe that I'm horic 
developed from a Semitic language that 

46
00:02:40,681 --> 00:02:43,260
had existed in the area before that 
migration.

47
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:47,190
And in recent years,
another theory has arisen that I'm horic

48
00:02:47,191 --> 00:02:48,024
is actually a creole that arose from 
contact between Semitic speaking 

49
00:02:51,211 --> 00:02:52,044
officers and cush should expediating 
soldiers in the accent might empire 

50
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:55,853
after the fourth century.
But this theory is hotly contested and 

51
00:02:58,741 --> 00:02:59,574
is not the general consensus.
The earliest known am Horak writing is 

52
00:03:02,231 --> 00:03:03,064
from the 13th century,
even though it was mainly a spoken 

53
00:03:05,501 --> 00:03:06,334
language at that time.
This was the time of the solomonic 

54
00:03:08,411 --> 00:03:10,180
dynasty when King,
no,

55
00:03:10,181 --> 00:03:11,600
I'm luck,
made Amharic,

56
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,350
the spoken Lingua Franca of the 
Ethiopian courts,

57
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:19,650
and it became known as the language of 
the king to sign a new goose gaze.

58
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,613
The language of the previous x amount 
rulers continued to be used as the 

59
00:03:23,441 --> 00:03:25,930
language of literature.
The sonance oof.

60
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,273
This resulted in a diagnostic situation 
that would last for centuries with gays 

61
00:03:31,091 --> 00:03:34,510
being used from literature and did the 
Ethiopian Orthodox Church.

62
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:39,630
And I'm Horak being used in speech in 
the 15th century under the rule of Zadie

63
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:40,503
Yacob troops who collected taxes for the
king likely brought em horic into other 

64
00:03:44,021 --> 00:03:44,470
regions.

65
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,303
Further south in the mid 19th century am
Horak began to replace a gaze as the 

66
00:03:49,601 --> 00:03:53,080
literary language case in point,
the Ethiopian Emperor's tail,

67
00:03:53,081 --> 00:03:53,914
just the second and mindy leak.
The second had their chronicles written 

68
00:03:56,741 --> 00:03:57,574
in Amharic rather than gaze,
which had been used for previous 

69
00:04:00,131 --> 00:04:00,964
emperors under mini leak.
The second Ethiopia grew into something 

70
00:04:04,151 --> 00:04:08,710
resembling its current borders am Horak 
became the defacto official language and

71
00:04:08,711 --> 00:04:09,544
emhart speaking officials were 
responsible for the newly incorporated 

72
00:04:12,251 --> 00:04:13,084
territories.
The spread of the printing press in the 

73
00:04:14,831 --> 00:04:15,664
19th and 20th centuries contributed 
further to the spread of Mri as in the 

74
00:04:19,151 --> 00:04:19,984
20th century.
Most new print materials including the 

75
00:04:22,301 --> 00:04:23,134
first newspaper,
were written in an pauric rather than 

76
00:04:24,941 --> 00:04:27,370
gays.
In the early 20th century,

77
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,010
Italian,
French and English were used as the main

78
00:04:30,011 --> 00:04:33,760
languages of school instruction.
But then in 19:44

79
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:37,810
AM horic became the sole language of 
instruction in primary schools under the

80
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:39,070
rule of Haile Selassie.

81
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,413
He then made them Horak the official 
language of Ethiopia in 1955 during the 

82
00:04:44,501 --> 00:04:49,501
socialist government known as the deck 
from 1974 to 1991 increased development,

83
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:51,723
urbanization and an increase in the 
number of public schools and adult 

84
00:04:54,641 --> 00:04:57,730
literacy programs caused them horic to 
spread even more,

85
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:58,623
but still empiric was much more widely 
spoken in towns and cities and not as 

86
00:05:01,991 --> 00:05:06,040
widely spoken in rural areas except in 
its original native regions.

87
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,173
After 1991 language policies were 
changed to give more influenced to the 

88
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:11,644
other languages of Ethiopia and there 
are over 80 of them currently regional 

89
00:05:15,221 --> 00:05:16,054
and local authorities can choose their 
own working language and their own 

90
00:05:18,641 --> 00:05:19,474
language of primary school education.
But Amharic remains the most widely 

91
00:05:22,901 --> 00:05:23,734
spoken Lingua Franca with a large 
proportion of the urban population 

92
00:05:26,591 --> 00:05:29,050
throughout the country being able to 
speak Amharic.

93
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:31,510
So what does,
I'm Horak like first of all,

94
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,180
what's this interesting script that I'm 
Horak is written in?

95
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:38,590
Well that's actually the gay script,
which is used not only to write the gays

96
00:05:38,591 --> 00:05:41,290
language,
but also amharic to Grenada and others.

97
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:45,730
The gay script is an Abogada.
Each character represents a syllable and

98
00:05:45,731 --> 00:05:46,564
consists of a consonant as its major 
components plus an attached ligature or 

99
00:05:49,871 --> 00:05:53,200
other modification that represents a 
vowel in Amharic.

100
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:57,680
This gaze based writing system is called
[inaudible] and I'm Horak.

101
00:05:57,681 --> 00:06:01,310
There are plain consonants similar to 
most of the consonants in English,

102
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:04,940
and there are glottals sized consonants 
or ejective consonants.

103
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,833
Globalized consonants are produced by 
closing and reopening the gladys the 

104
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:12,410
space between your vocal chords while 
making the consonant sound.

105
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:14,990
When transliterated using Latin 
characters,

106
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:15,883
they usually have a dot underneath them 
to distinguish them from their non 

107
00:06:18,681 --> 00:06:19,514
globalized equivalents.
Let's compare a plane consonant with 

108
00:06:22,161 --> 00:06:27,161
it's globalized equivalent to Teta.
Also notice the doubled consonant.

109
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:32,893
All consonants can be short or long,
long meaning that the consonant is 

110
00:06:36,111 --> 00:06:37,760
doubled double in length.

111
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:38,803
The distinction between short and long 
consonants is important because 

112
00:06:41,421 --> 00:06:42,254
sometimes the meaning of words is 
distinguished by the length of the 

113
00:06:44,481 --> 00:06:46,070
continent.
For example,

114
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:51,910
this means he said this means there is,
this means swimming one,

115
00:06:54,181 --> 00:06:56,000
Nah,
this means important,

116
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,313
so in both cases,
the length of the consonant 

117
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,070
distinguishes the meaning of the words 
doubled.

118
00:07:01,071 --> 00:07:03,290
Consonants are not distinguished in 
writing,

119
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,153
but in context amharic speakers have 
little trouble with that sentence 

120
00:07:07,311 --> 00:07:08,660
structure.
First,

121
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:13,250
let's look at an equational sentence 
using the verb to be you jus a Gel.

122
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,093
No,
this means the boy is short word for 

123
00:07:16,521 --> 00:07:17,570
word,
it's boy.

124
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:22,600
The short is Ou is a definite article is
boy you is the boy.

125
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:29,480
Notice that the verb to be is at the end
and the adjective comes before it.

126
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:33,320
Amharic is a verb.
Final language.

127
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:38,380
So when predicate of sentences,
the word order is sv or Ovi or Sov.

128
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,373
Of course some sentences have no object 
just to subject and an intransitive 

129
00:07:42,471 --> 00:07:43,760
verb.
For example,

130
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,550
did you?
What the sentence means?

131
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,160
The child fell word for word.
It's child,

132
00:07:49,161 --> 00:07:50,210
Duh.
He fell.

133
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:51,403
So this is the subject and this is the 
verb and here's a sentence that does 

134
00:07:54,201 --> 00:07:55,280
have a direct object.

135
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:00,290
It means that the hunter killed Elian 
word for word.

136
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:02,870
It's hunter,
the lion he killed.

137
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:05,450
Here's the subject,
the object and the verb.

138
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,650
Something we can add to this sentence is
the optional direct object marker.

139
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:14,360
Good Delta.
If you use the direct object marker,

140
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:18,080
then it's also possible to place the 
object at the beginning of the sentence,

141
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,370
making it,
oh sv.

142
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:25,490
Good.
And now let's try adding an adjective to

143
00:08:25,491 --> 00:08:28,860
the sentence I knew to look good.
Dead.

144
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:30,403
The sentence now means the hunter killed
a big lion and you can see that the 

145
00:08:33,081 --> 00:08:33,914
adjective is placed before the noun.
The previous sentences all have an 

146
00:08:37,101 --> 00:08:37,934
explicit subject,
but there can also be no explicit 

147
00:08:39,951 --> 00:08:41,390
subject.
For example,

148
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:46,070
this sentence meaning he opened the door
that rune [inaudible] word for word,

149
00:08:46,071 --> 00:08:49,520
it's door direct object marker.
He opened.

150
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:50,893
No explicit subject is necessary here 
because we know from the form of the 

151
00:08:53,721 --> 00:08:56,370
verb that it refers to the third person,
masculine,

152
00:08:56,371 --> 00:08:57,270
singular.
He.

153
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,390
So this sentence is just olvey object,
verb.

154
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:05,160
And that brings us to verbs similar to 
an other Semitic languages.

155
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,890
The verb consists of a stem and 
suffixes,

156
00:09:07,891 --> 00:09:09,630
which indicate the person,
gender,

157
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:12,450
and number of the subject.
Let's take a look at this example.

158
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:13,284
Verb meaning to break.
Here's the stem of the perfect form and 

159
00:09:15,961 --> 00:09:19,620
the suffix is placed after the stem.
Tell us about the doer of the action.

160
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:20,813
Sebesta sub sub,
sub sub sub borough Sabera to sub 

161
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,453
Barron.

162
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:33,510
Now let's look at the imperfect form 
based on this stem.

163
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:37,040
You said Rod to [inaudible] to 
[inaudible],

164
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:39,330
[inaudible],
[inaudible],

165
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,580
[inaudible],
[inaudible],

166
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,640
[inaudible],
[inaudible],

167
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:44,953
the root system.
Let's take a look at the stems of the 

168
00:09:47,061 --> 00:09:49,130
perfect form and the imperfect form 
again,

169
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:53,870
and let's focus on these letters here.
Similar to an other Semitic languages.

170
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,733
I'm Horak uses a system of root letters 
and templates into which the root 

171
00:09:57,801 --> 00:09:58,634
letters are inserted.
Roots consist of consonants commonly 

172
00:10:01,341 --> 00:10:03,140
three,
but it can also be two,

173
00:10:03,141 --> 00:10:03,974
four or five and they are placed into 
templates consisting of a vowel pattern 

174
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,713
as well as some continental affixes.
The root gives us the core meaning and 

175
00:10:12,951 --> 00:10:13,784
the template gives us grammatical 
information and more specific 

176
00:10:16,251 --> 00:10:19,040
information about the meaning.
Notice that with this verb,

177
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:22,700
the second route letter is doubled or 
germinated in the perfect form.

178
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:24,980
This is true for some verbs but not for 
others.

179
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,800
Those are a few of the important 
features of them.

180
00:10:27,801 --> 00:10:28,634
Horic.
Let's look at a few more example 

181
00:10:29,821 --> 00:10:31,610
sentences and see what else we find.

182
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:34,070
Here's the sentence,
meaning we must go today.

183
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,710
Study.
Made a Leben word for word.

184
00:10:36,711 --> 00:10:38,840
It's today to go.
We must,

185
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:39,913
in this sentence,
we see a modal verb meaning must just 

186
00:10:41,721 --> 00:10:42,554
like other verbs.
This modal verb is conjugated for the 

187
00:10:44,181 --> 00:10:45,290
subject.
In this case,

188
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:46,124
we,
the modal verb comes at the end and 

189
00:10:47,811 --> 00:10:50,450
before that we see the main verb meaning
to go in.

190
00:10:50,451 --> 00:10:54,380
It's infinitive form another sentence.
How can you meet [inaudible]?

191
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:59,150
This means where can I find a doctor?
[inaudible] word for word,

192
00:10:59,151 --> 00:11:01,640
it's doctor.
Where is found?

193
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,050
The word Hakeem is the same as the 
Arabic word for doctor and I would guess

194
00:11:06,051 --> 00:11:06,884
that this is a lone word.
This word means where question words 

195
00:11:09,651 --> 00:11:10,484
usually come directly before the verb 
and you can see that the object of the 

196
00:11:13,611 --> 00:11:14,444
verb comes first.
This is an imperfect verb with these 

197
00:11:17,361 --> 00:11:18,194
root consonants.
The ethics is showed that this is the 

198
00:11:20,151 --> 00:11:21,610
third person singular forum.

199
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:23,023
And onto the next sentence,
you're making a good of still being at 

200
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:30,380
this means I've lost my car keys work 
for words of car.

201
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,273
My key have been lost to me.
This pattern here of plus a noun plus 

202
00:11:36,561 --> 00:11:37,394
another.
Now is a typical way of showing 

203
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:41,120
possession or connection between two 
nouns,

204
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:44,270
and this is a verb with these two root 
consonants,

205
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,313
which mean to lose,
but this particular verb template makes 

206
00:11:47,781 --> 00:11:51,200
it reflexive or intransitive.
So what means to be lost?

207
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:52,063
This is the conjunct form of the which 
can be used like the present perfect in 

208
00:11:55,451 --> 00:11:56,284
English and this ending here,
I mean something like happened to me 

209
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:01,390
showing that the speaker is affected by 
the action.

210
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,720
Notice that in this sentence,
the word for key is singular.

211
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:08,650
Plural can often be understood from the 
context even if you're used the singular

212
00:12:08,651 --> 00:12:09,484
form,
but we can also use an explicit plural 

213
00:12:11,111 --> 00:12:15,210
form of Tau Vignette.

214
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,710
Again,
this means I've lost my car keys,

215
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:18,603
but here you can see that a plural 
ending has been added to the word for 

216
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:21,874
key,
but it's not entirely necessary to use 

217
00:12:23,651 --> 00:12:24,484
the plural form.
You can use the singular form and it 

218
00:12:26,261 --> 00:12:27,094
context.
It should be clear whether you're 

219
00:12:28,061 --> 00:12:28,894
talking about just one or many and onto 
the next sentence and Magoo and no 

220
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:36,700
deadline.
This means we love Ethiopian cuisine.

221
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:40,480
Word for word,
it's of Ethiopia food we love.

222
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:41,493
Again,
we see that pattern showing possession 

223
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:43,743
or relationship between two nouns and 
here we see the imperfect form of the 

224
00:12:47,081 --> 00:12:48,430
verb,
meaning to love.

225
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,293
Here's the stem and she wrote the 
affixes telling us that this is first 

226
00:12:52,091 --> 00:12:53,650
person plural.
In other words,

227
00:12:53,651 --> 00:12:57,670
the we form and one more sentence that 
it took going,

228
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:58,613
that's a better outcome.
This means I didn't break the vase that 

229
00:13:01,191 --> 00:13:02,020
it going.

230
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:04,660
That's a better word for word.
It's veys.

231
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:06,003
I broke negative conjugation in Amharic,
there's a special negative perfect form 

232
00:13:10,061 --> 00:13:12,550
of verbs.
The negative form is made by adding this

233
00:13:12,551 --> 00:13:15,430
prefix and the suffix to the regular 
perfect for them.

234
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:19,540
And here's the word for veys and here 
are the definite article suffix,

235
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:20,463
but since it's following another vowel,
it's written as well rather than Ooh as 

236
00:13:25,901 --> 00:13:26,734
a Semitic language,
amharic has some vocabulary that 

237
00:13:28,721 --> 00:13:32,170
overlaps with other Semitic languages 
like Hebrew and Arabic.

238
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:33,183
Some of the similar words are loan words
from other languages like Arabic or 

239
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:37,024
gays,
but some are cognates that develop from 

240
00:13:38,891 --> 00:13:41,950
a common ancestor as the words and other
Semitic languages.

241
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:42,813
And sometimes it's hard to know if the 
word is a lone word or an original 

242
00:13:45,221 --> 00:13:46,990
cognate.
For example,

243
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:50,910
the word we saw before,
which means break the same.

244
00:13:50,911 --> 00:13:54,010
The third person,
perfect form and Hebrew would be Shavaya

245
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,173
and in Hebrew sometimes the second route
letter like a v sound is doubled and 

246
00:13:58,391 --> 00:13:59,224
pronounced like a b sound,
which makes the similarity even more 

247
00:14:01,511 --> 00:14:02,344
obvious.

248
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,700
And we also solve the work to kill.
This is the third person.

249
00:14:06,701 --> 00:14:08,320
Perfect form.
In Hebrew,

250
00:14:08,321 --> 00:14:11,980
it's cattal meaning to slay or to kill.
In Arabic,

251
00:14:11,981 --> 00:14:12,814
it's clicky law.
The consonants here are not exactly the 

252
00:14:15,251 --> 00:14:17,470
same,
but I think there's a connection between

253
00:14:17,471 --> 00:14:21,580
the g sound in Amharic and the cup or 
sounds in the other languages.

254
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,473
And I think there's a connection between
the de and the sounds in the other 

255
00:14:25,271 --> 00:14:26,770
languages.
Another example,

256
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,633
the word for Berry in Hebrew,
it's havas and an Arabic of butter in 

257
00:14:34,301 --> 00:14:37,090
Amharic.
The verb meaning to here is sem,

258
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,490
and this is the third person.
Perfect form,

259
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,940
meaning he heard in Hebrew,
it's Shama in Arabic,

260
00:14:42,941 --> 00:14:43,774
it's some off in Hebrew and Arabic.
There's an extra route letter that was 

261
00:14:46,901 --> 00:14:47,734
lost in the [inaudible] word and it has 
mostly become silent and modern Hebrew 

262
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,633
but still written and I'm horic.
The word for I is in Hebrew it's iron 

263
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:57,403
and in Arabic gets,
I mean I would love to be able to say 

264
00:14:59,811 --> 00:15:04,460
that the English word I is related to 
those but it's not another one.

265
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:07,040
In Amharic there's theirs which means 
house.

266
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,173
In Hebrew it's bite,
but when it's used in a compound word 

267
00:15:10,461 --> 00:15:11,294
with another noun,
it's pronounced the bait like in 

268
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:13,803
Batesville,
the word force school in Arabic it's 

269
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,544
bait or bite,
but the amount of vocabulary that M 

270
00:15:20,341 --> 00:15:23,960
Horak has in common with Hebrew and 
Arabic might be less than you'd expect.

271
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:24,883
That's partly because a lot of the 
vocabulary is of Ku shidduch origin as 

272
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:32,660
much as 30% and other vocabulary is 
unique to empiric or to Ethio.

273
00:15:32,661 --> 00:15:33,494
Semitic.
Amharic is a very interesting language 

274
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:40,970
and it's a language with clearly semitic
features including the verbal system and

275
00:15:40,971 --> 00:15:44,870
the root system using continental roots 
and inserting them into templates.

276
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,793
Those are things I'm familiar with from 
other Semitic languages like Hebrew and 

277
00:15:48,321 --> 00:15:49,154
Arabic and then include some of the 
vocabulary we just looked at a second 

278
00:15:51,891 --> 00:15:52,724
ago,
but some elements are quite different 

279
00:15:53,811 --> 00:15:57,320
from other Semitic languages such as its
Sov word order.

280
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:00,710
Amharic is a language that I would love 
to dig into more in the future.

281
00:16:00,711 --> 00:16:04,550
At some point in my last video on 
Japanese,

282
00:16:04,551 --> 00:16:08,240
I forgot to ask a question of the day.
So today I'm not going to forget.

283
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:11,630
Here is the question of the day for 
speakers of M Horak.

284
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:15,860
How widely is amharic spoken in your 
area and your community and if you're an

285
00:16:15,861 --> 00:16:18,770
immigrant from Ethiopia living somewhere
else in the world,

286
00:16:18,771 --> 00:16:22,040
what language do members of your 
community normally speak with each other

287
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:24,790
and for speakers of other Semitic 
languages?

288
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:27,970
Have you noticed the similarities 
between m horic and your language?

289
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,310
What sorts of similarities have you 
noticed?

290
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:32,650
Be sure to follow Lang,
focus on facebook,

291
00:16:32,651 --> 00:16:33,940
twitter,
and instagram.

292
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:37,600
And once again I want to say thank you 
to all of my patrion supporters,

293
00:16:37,601 --> 00:16:38,434
especially these wonderful people right 
here on the screen for their monthly 

294
