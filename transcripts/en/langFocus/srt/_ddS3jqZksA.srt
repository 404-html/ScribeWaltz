00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:03,660
Hello everyone.
Welcome to the Lange focus channel.

2
00:00:03,661 --> 00:00:05,670
My name is Paul.
Thank you for tuning in.

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:10,680
Today's topic is reactivating a language
that you haven't used in a long time.

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,970
A lot of colleague lights and a lot of 
language and fuzziest.

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:18,990
They'll say things like ice be 15 
languages or I speak 20 languages or you

6
00:00:18,991 --> 00:00:21,540
make your 30 or 40 or crazy numbers like
that,

7
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,553
and that can be really intimidating 
because most of us think I could never 

8
00:00:25,801 --> 00:00:28,190
learn that many languages.
I'm just a normal person.

9
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,890
I don't have that much talent.
But what most of those people are saying

10
00:00:31,891 --> 00:00:36,210
is that they have learned that many 
languages well during their lifetime.

11
00:00:36,211 --> 00:00:37,044
They usually can't switch between all of
those languages whenever they want 

12
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:41,513
without taking some time to reactivate 
the language and kind of get back into 

13
00:00:45,451 --> 00:00:46,284
it.
So they kind of need some preparation 

14
00:00:47,401 --> 00:00:49,680
time before they can speak that language
again.

15
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:50,873
Now most people usually have some 
languages that are kind of in the front 

16
00:00:53,371 --> 00:00:54,204
of their brand,
their active languages that can switch 

17
00:00:55,861 --> 00:00:56,694
between them.
I think that's usually like three or 

18
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:00,990
four languages.
I think it depends on the person and how

19
00:01:00,991 --> 00:01:02,820
often they use all of those in their 
life.

20
00:01:02,821 --> 00:01:06,900
But in my experience it's three or four.
And in my observation of other people,

21
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:11,040
it seems to be three or four the other 
languages aside from that kind of recede

22
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:13,500
into the background and they'd become 
dormant.

23
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,950
And in order to use those languages you 
have to reactivate them,

24
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,620
get back into them.
So if somebody said to me right now,

25
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,620
okay,
you're going to Israel tomorrow,

26
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:24,180
you have to be able to speak Hebrew 
tomorrow,

27
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:28,140
I would kind of panic because I haven't 
spoken Hebrew in about 12 years.

28
00:01:28,141 --> 00:01:28,974
So it would take me a few days,
it would take me a week to take me a 

29
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:32,603
couple of weeks to get back into Hebrew 
to the point where I was confident 

30
00:01:35,191 --> 00:01:36,024
speaking it,
even though I would say that 12 years 

31
00:01:37,591 --> 00:01:38,424
ago I was conversationally fluent in 
Hebrew and I could read it pretty well 

32
00:01:41,521 --> 00:01:42,180
too.

33
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,930
I would still need some time to refresh 
my,

34
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,793
my language skills and get back into 
things because it's receded into the 

35
00:01:48,661 --> 00:01:51,510
background for sure.
So how do you reactivate a language like

36
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:53,160
that that's become dormant?
Well,

37
00:01:53,161 --> 00:01:53,994
you basically need to just dive right 
back into it and see where your 

38
00:01:56,851 --> 00:01:59,550
weaknesses lie and see what you can do 
and see what you can to do.

39
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,413
And the best way to do that is by 
interacting with someone and using the 

40
00:02:02,941 --> 00:02:04,950
language communicatively.
Now,

41
00:02:04,951 --> 00:02:08,940
recently I did that at work.
I realized that one of my coworkers is a

42
00:02:08,941 --> 00:02:09,774
native Hebrew speaker,
so I tried having a conversation with 

43
00:02:12,151 --> 00:02:15,180
him and Hebrew and I could do it kind 
of,

44
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,043
but I realized that a lot of things that
slipped my mind and I wasn't nearly at 

45
00:02:19,441 --> 00:02:22,080
the level that I was 12 years ago,
which is to be expected.

46
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,913
I wasn't surprised.
I was actually surprised by how well I 

47
00:02:25,381 --> 00:02:28,800
could speak Hebrew who had this point 
after 12 years of dormancy.

48
00:02:28,801 --> 00:02:31,380
But uh,
that experience was important because it

49
00:02:31,381 --> 00:02:32,041
showed me,
okay,

50
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:35,040
these are the things I'm forgetting.
These are the things that are not such a

51
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:37,740
problem.
The things that are usually the first to

52
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:41,400
slip and go away.
When the language becomes dormant is the

53
00:02:41,401 --> 00:02:42,234
vocabulary.
Vocabulary goes away really quickly and 

54
00:02:44,491 --> 00:02:46,980
sometimes it's even really basic 
vocabulary.

55
00:02:46,981 --> 00:02:48,120
You know,
things like apple,

56
00:02:48,121 --> 00:02:48,954
things like car words like sleep and 
stuff like that often will just 

57
00:02:51,811 --> 00:02:52,644
disappear from your,
from your memory and it's in there 

58
00:02:54,901 --> 00:02:58,140
passively.
Usually usually your passive skills will

59
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:01,240
kind of remain intact and when you hear 
those words you'll understand them,

60
00:03:01,241 --> 00:03:03,550
but when it's time to speak,
they won't come up.

61
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,593
I would say that that's definitely true 
for vocabulary and to some extent also 

62
00:03:07,961 --> 00:03:08,794
for verb conjugations in my experience,
but in my experience it's not that way 

63
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:14,470
for syntax or word order.

64
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:15,483
I don't really have any trouble building
Hebrew sentences or making sentences in 

65
00:03:19,001 --> 00:03:19,834
the language.
It's mostly a problem of vocabulary and 

66
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:22,834
to some extent the verb conjugations.
Usually there's also a kind of lack of 

67
00:03:25,751 --> 00:03:28,660
fluency and it takes you longer to get 
the sentences out.

68
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,930
I don't think that's a problem with the 
grammar or sentence structure though.

69
00:03:31,931 --> 00:03:32,764
I think that's typically a problem with 
vocabulary because you have these ideas 

70
00:03:36,251 --> 00:03:37,084
you want to express,
but you don't know how to bring up the 

71
00:03:39,701 --> 00:03:40,534
words to express those ideas.
So you slow yourself down in order to 

72
00:03:43,331 --> 00:03:44,164
retrieve those words and look for the 
vocabulary to express what you want to 

73
00:03:47,081 --> 00:03:49,690
say.
And sometimes you end up paraphrasing or

74
00:03:49,691 --> 00:03:53,140
explaining it in a different way and 
that just slows down your fluency.

75
00:03:53,141 --> 00:03:55,090
I don't think it's a problem with her 
sentence structure.

76
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:55,953
To me in my experience,
that's usually something that sticks 

77
00:03:58,031 --> 00:03:58,864
longterm.

78
00:03:59,020 --> 00:03:59,853
Now assuming that you learned the 
language quite well the first time 

79
00:04:01,721 --> 00:04:02,554
around,
and by well I mean conversationally 

80
00:04:04,601 --> 00:04:05,434
fluent,
then it's basically a matter of 

81
00:04:06,761 --> 00:04:07,594
refamiliarizing yourself with those 
things that you've forgotten so that 

82
00:04:10,391 --> 00:04:11,224
they can become active instead of 
passive so that you can use them 

83
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,213
productively.
You can speak using those elements and 

84
00:04:17,171 --> 00:04:18,004
you can write using those elements,
not just understand them when you 

85
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:21,394
encountered them.
Sell the two steps of that are 

86
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:23,823
encountering those language elements 
passively with books or with videos and 

87
00:04:27,311 --> 00:04:30,220
audio and then giving yourself a chance 
to use it.

88
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,113
So I have some old Hebrew materials that
are used to use back in the day that I 

89
00:04:34,031 --> 00:04:34,864
can use to refamiliarize myself 
passively with some of these language 

90
00:04:38,621 --> 00:04:39,454
elements.
So I have this one Hebrew in three 

91
00:04:40,601 --> 00:04:42,130
months.
This one I think is out of print,

92
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,310
but I really liked these in three months
series by you go,

93
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:47,230
they're all really good if you could 
find them online.

94
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:48,363
But this is the Hebrew one.
Let me look at a sentence and just see 

95
00:04:50,711 --> 00:04:52,840
if it reminds me of things that I've 
forgotten.

96
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,253
Uh,
it says here on this page and Neil 

97
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:58,830
Patella hood's a nickel,
a chef shunted sally flatwoods.

98
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,850
Key.
O'Neil have Leo or backwards.

99
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,753
Uh,
so that means he's talking about a 

100
00:05:02,861 --> 00:05:03,694
marathon and he says,
I want to run and I think I need to run 

101
00:05:07,511 --> 00:05:09,520
because I love being outside.
Okay.

102
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,130
Uh,
probably that's all familiar to me.

103
00:05:12,131 --> 00:05:13,630
I wouldn't have forgotten any of those 
words.

104
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:15,250
The next sentence,
uh,

105
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:19,330
a of Albert holds up.
We laid low [inaudible] the Shabbat.

106
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,350
Okay.
So he says,

107
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,810
but on the other hand when he says,
but in any case,

108
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,840
maybe I shouldn't because I had a cold 
on Saturday,

109
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:29,560
so the word [inaudible] which means in 
any case,

110
00:05:29,561 --> 00:05:32,800
I don't think I would've remembered that
unless I saw it written right here.

111
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:33,693
But now it's coming back to me just 
seeing it once and also the word 

112
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:37,750
Nazella,
that means like a cold.

113
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,240
I haven't thought of that word in 12 
plus years,

114
00:05:40,241 --> 00:05:41,074
so I wouldn't have been able to pull 
that word up out of my memory and 

115
00:05:44,051 --> 00:05:45,820
produce it.
But now that I've seen it,

116
00:05:45,821 --> 00:05:48,940
I'm starting to remember cases when I 
used this word back in the day.

117
00:05:48,941 --> 00:05:49,774
So I think this is already being 
refreshed in my memory and I'll be able 

118
00:05:53,471 --> 00:05:54,304
to use those words in the near future.
Another book I used is this one 

119
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,850
mastering Hebrew,
which is actually one of the FSI books,

120
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,993
the free public domain ones that you can
get for free on the Internet in pdf 

121
00:06:06,171 --> 00:06:08,720
form.
But the Hebrew one's good.

122
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,330
Let me look at something in this.
Let's see.

123
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:13,690
Uh,
he says there's a shot,

124
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,350
a middleware,
the ls there,

125
00:06:16,351 --> 00:06:17,460
Shiva,
the Shiva is,

126
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,790
and look dumb again.

127
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,510
And he'd say [inaudible] and they'll 
have the book.

128
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,790
Okay.
So he says,

129
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:23,624
at what time do you get up?
And the other guy says around seven and 

130
00:06:26,661 --> 00:06:28,220
the first guy says,
it's seven.

131
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,080
That's early in.
The second guy says,

132
00:06:30,081 --> 00:06:32,120
yes,
I need to make breakfast for my family.

133
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:36,350
So I'm most of those words,
we're still kind of familiar to mix.

134
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,780
They're quite basic,
but the word mittal hour to get up,

135
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:40,730
I don't think I would have been able to 
remember that.

136
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,610
And now that I'm thinking about that 
word,

137
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:44,444
I'm remembering other related works like
shown malware shut on mail order that 

138
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,930
that's like an alarm clock,
a clock that wakes you up.

139
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:55,610
So I'm remembering related words and 
it's kind of becoming like a web.

140
00:06:55,611 --> 00:06:56,444
Like I remember one word.
Then I remember related words and other 

141
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,084
things.
And now I'm thinking of some sentences 

142
00:07:00,531 --> 00:07:02,750
with that word that I made a long time 
ago.

143
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:03,853
So it all comes back when you just start
to refamiliarize yourself with some 

144
00:07:07,341 --> 00:07:08,174
things that have become dormant.
So those are two textbooks that I've 

145
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,704
used in the past.
I also like to use phrase books like 

146
00:07:14,511 --> 00:07:15,344
this.
This is the lonely planet Hebrew phrase 

147
00:07:16,741 --> 00:07:18,020
book.
These ones are quite good.

148
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:19,610
I like the lonely planet.
His books,

149
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:23,120
they're good to just flip through and 
just read simple sentences,

150
00:07:23,121 --> 00:07:26,900
read simple phrases,
and just review basic vocabulary because

151
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:29,720
most of the vocabulary in here,
his daily life vocabulary,

152
00:07:29,721 --> 00:07:31,520
it's quite practical.
So it's good.

153
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:35,390
It's a good way to just to get that core
vocabulary back into your,

154
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:39,440
your active vocabulary.
So if I just opened to a random page,

155
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:42,170
let's see if I can do it.
It says,

156
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,240
okay,
uh,

157
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,750
[inaudible] uh,
can you write this down please?

158
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:49,243
A Little Sean?
I don't know if I would have remembered 

159
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:53,840
the word Leo Sharm without seeing it 
right here.

160
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:54,630
So,
uh,

161
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:55,463
I probably would have said like half 
Shah [inaudible] is it possible to rate 

162
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:00,943
this?
I probably would have said let's solve 

163
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:04,100
instead of real sean.
But when you're writing something down,

164
00:08:04,101 --> 00:08:06,320
like on a list,
you just show them is the better word to

165
00:08:06,321 --> 00:08:08,000
use.
So it's good that aside here,

166
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:10,000
another example,
let's see.

167
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:12,410
Um,
[inaudible] at the bank.

168
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,873
Ah,
okay.

169
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,520
When do they open the bank?
When does the bank open?

170
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:17,503
Probably those words are okay.
I would have remembered those materials 

171
00:08:19,761 --> 00:08:24,761
when [inaudible] comes from pat 
documents to open.

172
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,140
So I would've remembered these words,
I think.

173
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:32,400
But let's see if Shar Lao viola guns 
[inaudible] uh,

174
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:36,080
can I transfer money here from my bank?
So that one,

175
00:08:36,081 --> 00:08:39,110
I think I would've remembered most of 
those words except Leah via,

176
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,920
which is to transfer.
Um,

177
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:41,983
but now that I've seen it,
I'm remembering a speech that they saw 

178
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:49,310
by Benjamin Netanyahu on tv like 12 
years ago where he said something like,

179
00:08:49,311 --> 00:08:50,750
uh,
uh,

180
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,750
good luck.
Bye.

181
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:56,750
[inaudible] new [inaudible]. [inaudible]

182
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,140
means like,
uh,

183
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:00,143
this is his Zionist philosophy you said 
on there by bringing all the vast 

184
00:09:03,811 --> 00:09:06,720
majority of Jews to Israel,
can we fulfill the dream of Zionism?

185
00:09:06,721 --> 00:09:07,554
So she was saying bring,
he said they hired via ems to transfer 

186
00:09:10,261 --> 00:09:11,094
them here.
So I just remembered that after seeing 

187
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,870
the word in this,
this phrase book right now.

188
00:09:15,871 --> 00:09:16,704
So that's the kind of thing you can do.
It just refamiliarize yourself with 

189
00:09:19,651 --> 00:09:20,484
those language elements.
And then you start to connect them with 

190
00:09:22,411 --> 00:09:24,990
other elements that you've learned with 
other situations.

191
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:25,824
You've used the men,
and then you start to get that snowball 

192
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,760
effect.
So that's one of the things you can do.

193
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,670
Also,
in recent months with Hebrew,

194
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:35,790
I've been watching some,
some youtube videos in Hebrew.

195
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,260
Uh,
that wasn't planned.

196
00:09:37,261 --> 00:09:40,560
It was just that I stumbled upon some 
interesting videos.

197
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:42,840
There were street interviews done partly
and Hebrew.

198
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:43,703
So listening to the Hebrew passively 
reminded me of some of those language 

199
00:09:46,921 --> 00:09:47,754
elements.
So remember it a lot of vocabulary and 

200
00:09:49,561 --> 00:09:51,870
it improved my listening skills again,
but that's,

201
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,704
I'll just riff familiarization.
It's also important to produce the 

202
00:09:55,621 --> 00:09:56,340
language,
right?

203
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,173
So I'm going to take some Hebrew lessons
to get back into producing Hebrew 

204
00:10:01,081 --> 00:10:01,914
verbally and we'll see how it goes.
I'll probably just start practicing 

205
00:10:04,621 --> 00:10:07,470
those elements that I've been reviewing 
and all of these books.

206
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,600
But sit,
uh,

207
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,920
Num Sheer Laguna Bezalel Oh,
I'd see lockers or legal claims.

208
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:20,010
Uh,
I need any hot say,

209
00:10:20,011 --> 00:10:24,800
let's say l there's metal at the palm of
our last shelf money and this amount.

210
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:27,630
[inaudible].
So basically in conclusion,

211
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:28,703
I just want to say don't feel that you 
have some kind of pressure to learn to 

212
00:10:31,921 --> 00:10:32,754
be fluent in multiple languages and to 
always be able to speak them all the 

213
00:10:35,641 --> 00:10:36,474
time.
Most people who are language and 

214
00:10:37,701 --> 00:10:39,840
fuzziest are polyglots there can't do 
that.

215
00:10:39,841 --> 00:10:42,600
They need to actually prioritize certain
languages.

216
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:45,030
Those are usually the ones that they're 
currently using,

217
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,020
the ones that are currently relevant to 
their life.

218
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,440
They're focused on using those ones and 
keeping them active.

219
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,040
And the other ones they have learned in 
the past received them become dormant.

220
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,590
But that's okay because if you ever need
them,

221
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:56,603
you just need a bit of notice and then 
you can reactivate them by re 

222
00:10:59,381 --> 00:11:00,214
familiarizing yourself with some of the 
things that have slipped out of your 

223
00:11:02,581 --> 00:11:03,414
memory and then producing them so you 
can get them back into your active 

224
00:11:07,141 --> 00:11:07,980
language ability.

225
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:10,500
So don't sweat it.
Don't feel any kind of pressure.

226
00:11:10,501 --> 00:11:13,860
Don't take on some kind of ego identity.
Like,

227
00:11:13,861 --> 00:11:17,130
I need to speak all these languages 
because I'm a polyglot or whatever.

228
00:11:17,131 --> 00:11:18,330
It.
Don't do that to yourself.

229
00:11:18,331 --> 00:11:20,730
Just relax and have fun.
Enjoy the languages.

230
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,500
No,
that there will always be there.

231
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,900
Especially if you've learned the 
language quite well,

232
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:28,380
then it will always be there.
You just need to re activate it,

233
00:11:28,381 --> 00:11:30,240
so don't even worry about it.
All right,

234
00:11:30,241 --> 00:11:31,650
this is Paul.
Thank you for watching.

235
00:11:31,651 --> 00:11:34,350
Have a good nights.
When you're an infant,

236
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,513
you spend about a year just sitting 
there listening to the language before 

237
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:40,920
you actually see anything.
Just absorbing the salads.

238
00:11:40,921 --> 00:11:41,754
You're internalizing the phonology 
before you actually produce it as an 

239
00:11:44,851 --> 00:11:47,070
adult that you have a year to sit around
doing that.

240
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:48,143
I know I don't.
So I've been talking about focusing the 

241
00:11:49,681 --> 00:11:50,514
grand sense,
like in terms of your large goals and 

242
00:11:52,501 --> 00:11:53,334
that kind of thing,
but of course the focus is also 

243
00:11:54,721 --> 00:11:58,770
important in the moment because we live 
in such a distraction prong world.
