00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,283
Hello everyone.
Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and 

2
00:00:02,911 --> 00:00:06,810
my name is Paul.
Today's topic is the African's language.

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:10,110
A couple of weeks ago I released a video
on the Dutch language,

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,680
which you can find right here.
This is kind of a followup to that video

5
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:16,530
because Afrikaans is a descendant of 
Dutch.

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,340
That means that just like Dutch 
Afrikaans is a west Germanic language.

7
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:25,410
Afrikaans has a total of about 7.1
million native speakers with 6.8

8
00:00:25,411 --> 00:00:29,310
5 million of those in South Africa and 
that's about 13.5%

9
00:00:29,311 --> 00:00:30,144
of the South African population that 
makes it the third most widely spoken 

10
00:00:32,911 --> 00:00:36,480
language in South Africa and it's the 
majority language in the western half of

11
00:00:36,481 --> 00:00:37,314
the country.
That means Northern Cape and Western 

12
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,510
Cape provinces.
It's the native language of about 61% of

13
00:00:42,511 --> 00:00:43,344
white South Africans and it's the native
language of more than three quarters of 

14
00:00:46,111 --> 00:00:49,230
quote unquote colored South Africans,
about 3.4

15
00:00:49,231 --> 00:00:51,660
million people in South Africa.
The term colored,

16
00:00:51,661 --> 00:00:53,580
it means people love mixed racial 
background.

17
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,660
I didn't choose that term myself.
It's also the native language of 4.6%

18
00:00:57,661 --> 00:01:01,500
of Asian South Africans.
It's also the native language of 1.5%

19
00:01:01,501 --> 00:01:03,960
of black South Africans.
That's about 600,000

20
00:01:03,961 --> 00:01:04,794
people and there are 10 to 15000002nd 
language speakers in South Africa in 

21
00:01:08,581 --> 00:01:11,280
Namibia.
It's the native language of 10 or 11% of

22
00:01:11,281 --> 00:01:13,860
people,
including 60% of the white population.

23
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:18,060
It's also widely used as a Lingua Franca
and most people can speak it as a second

24
00:01:18,061 --> 00:01:21,090
or third language.
So how did the story of Afrikaans Begin?

25
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:21,953
Dutch speaking settlers arrived in 
southern Africa in the year 1652 when 

26
00:01:25,411 --> 00:01:26,244
the Dutch east India company set up a 
resupply station at Cape Town for its 

27
00:01:29,191 --> 00:01:32,310
ships travelling to the Indian 
subcontinent and to Southeast Asia.

28
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:34,590
Their goal was to get fresh water,
food,

29
00:01:34,591 --> 00:01:36,690
and other supplies for their long sea 
journeys.

30
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:37,583
When the local [inaudible] people,
people who speak [inaudible] Sawn 

31
00:01:39,451 --> 00:01:40,284
languages,
we're unwilling to meet the trade 

32
00:01:41,641 --> 00:01:45,510
demands of the Dutch east India company.
The company drove them out of the area,

33
00:01:45,511 --> 00:01:46,344
into the inland and replaced them with 
European settlers and with slaves from 

34
00:01:49,381 --> 00:01:50,430
other parts of Africa.

35
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:55,403
Most of the farmers who were known as 
borrowers were former laborers of the 

36
00:01:57,931 --> 00:02:00,360
Dutch east India company,
and most of them were Dutch,

37
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:01,283
but some of them were French or German,
too upset with the conditions placed 

38
00:02:04,201 --> 00:02:06,060
upon them by the Dutch east India 
company.

39
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:09,930
The European settlers began expanding 
inland so they could farm outside of the

40
00:02:09,931 --> 00:02:10,764
area controlled by the company.
The Dutch east India company wanted to 

41
00:02:13,081 --> 00:02:13,914
prevent this inland expansion,
so they outlawed the expansion and did 

42
00:02:16,681 --> 00:02:19,350
European immigration and increased the 
number of slaves.

43
00:02:19,351 --> 00:02:21,330
Instead,
some of the slaves were brought from the

44
00:02:21,331 --> 00:02:24,750
Indian subcontinent and from present day
Malaysia and Indonesia,

45
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,673
Britain's seized control of the Cape 
Colony in 1815 and began to import 

46
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:29,813
British settlers.
The British eventually took steps to 

47
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,250
eliminate slavery and to put heavy 
restrictions on the border of farmers.

48
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,143
Large numbers of bowlers migrated 
further inland to escape British rule 

49
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:40,043
setting up their own communities and 
encountering various native African 

50
00:02:42,481 --> 00:02:43,620
communities along the way.

51
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:47,010
After a series of conflicts with the 
British called the bowral wars,

52
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,873
South Africa became a unified British 
colony until its independence in 1961 

53
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:54,210
but this is lang focus.
We're supposed to focus on languages.

54
00:02:54,211 --> 00:02:55,800
Why is all this history important?
Well,

55
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:59,350
it's to help you imagine the conditions 
under which the language spoken by those

56
00:02:59,351 --> 00:03:02,410
Dutch settlers changed and eventually 
became Afrikaans.

57
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,303
Exactly.
How Africans developed is a highly 

58
00:03:05,021 --> 00:03:05,854
debated subject with some people 
insisting that it's a natural direct 

59
00:03:08,591 --> 00:03:09,424
descendant of Dutch.
While other people insist that it's 

60
00:03:11,111 --> 00:03:11,944
actually a creole language that arose 
when slaves and laborers attempted to 

61
00:03:14,921 --> 00:03:17,440
learn Dutch.
If you're not sure what creole languages

62
00:03:17,441 --> 00:03:18,274
are,
you can have a look at my video on 

63
00:03:18,941 --> 00:03:19,774
pigeon and Creole languages right here.
Nobody knows exactly what processes 

64
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,393
caused Afrikaans to develop,
but it's unlikely that either of those 

65
00:03:26,921 --> 00:03:30,220
two theories is 100% true.
In the early years of the Cape Colony,

66
00:03:30,221 --> 00:03:31,054
there was a continuous stream of Dutch 
speaking immigrants as well as other 

67
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:35,800
Europeans who learn Dutch as a second 
language.

68
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:36,693
There were also many local speakers of 
[inaudible] languages who learned Dutch 

69
00:03:39,191 --> 00:03:40,024
as a second language and there were also
African and Asian slaves who learned 

70
00:03:42,341 --> 00:03:43,174
Dutch as a second language.
Local Africans and slaves most likely 

71
00:03:45,641 --> 00:03:47,950
spoke a Dutch based pigeon language at 
some point.

72
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:48,843
Typically a creole language arises when 
a pidgin language becomes the native 

73
00:03:52,061 --> 00:03:52,894
language of the next generation,
usually without a lot of influence from 

74
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:58,240
speakers of the original standard 
language.

75
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:00,640
For example,
slave owners or colonial settlers,

76
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:01,503
but in the case of Africans,
there was always extensive contact with 

77
00:04:04,031 --> 00:04:04,864
native speakers of Dutch,
more specifically the emerging dialect 

78
00:04:07,301 --> 00:04:08,134
called Cape Dutch.
On top of that standard Dutch and not 

79
00:04:10,421 --> 00:04:13,180
Cape Dutch was the language that was 
taught in schools.

80
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:14,043
Both of these factors would help.
Cape Dutch remain relatively similar to 

81
00:04:16,391 --> 00:04:17,224
standard Dutch,
so even if Afrikaans is a creole 

82
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:20,134
language,
it's more like a partial creole or a 

83
00:04:21,581 --> 00:04:24,910
semi creole language to creole languages
that I'm familiar with.

84
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:25,743
Our top pcn and be slammer which are 
spoken in Melanesia and they are 

85
00:04:28,721 --> 00:04:29,554
english-based creoles.
Both of those languages consist of 

86
00:04:31,691 --> 00:04:34,240
mainly English vocabulary,
but with the syntax,

87
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:36,790
grammar and phonology of an oceanic 
language.

88
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:40,510
They're essentially new languages that 
got their vocabulary from English,

89
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:43,750
but Afrikaans is not like that.
It's grammar became simplified,

90
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:44,584
but the syntax of the language is 
basically the same as Dutch and it's 

91
00:04:46,871 --> 00:04:50,710
phonology is also close to Dutch.
So it seems that Africans developed from

92
00:04:50,711 --> 00:04:51,544
a form of Dutch that was influenced by 
second language speakers rather than a 

93
00:04:54,431 --> 00:04:57,340
completely new creole language featuring
Dutch vocabulary.

94
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:58,323
That's my personal assessment,
but I'm sure some people will disagree 

95
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,593
and that's fine.
Africans continued to develop until it 

96
00:05:03,521 --> 00:05:04,354
was legally recognized as its own 
language in 1925 so how was Afrikaans 

97
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:08,953
different from Dutch lone words?
The vocabulary of Africans was 

98
00:05:11,531 --> 00:05:14,650
influenced by the various languages that
it came in contact with.

99
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:15,940
For example,
Molay,

100
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:16,803
the word meaning almost comes from the 
Malay word hum being the word bio 

101
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:25,480
meaning much comes from the Malay Word 
Been Yak Portuguese.

102
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:29,290
The word combat meaning blanket comes 
from the Portuguese word.

103
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,213
Who would the word cuddle?
Meaning Catalan closure comes from the 

104
00:05:33,431 --> 00:05:34,450
Portuguese word.
Cool.

105
00:05:34,451 --> 00:05:38,260
How we have a similar word,
corral and English cohesin languages.

106
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:39,123
The words for a lot of things in the 
local African environment came from 

107
00:05:41,321 --> 00:05:42,790
Khoisan languages.
For example,

108
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:45,010
plants and animals.
This animal is called a Kudu.

109
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:45,903
Good Dude.
But the overwhelming majority of 

110
00:05:47,111 --> 00:05:47,944
Africans vocabulary is Dutch,
more than 90% or as high as 95% 

111
00:05:51,611 --> 00:05:52,444
spelling.
Africans underwent some spelling 

112
00:05:53,951 --> 00:05:54,784
simplifications to make the written 
language more reflective of the spoken 

113
00:05:57,681 --> 00:05:59,660
language.
I won't mention all of the changes,

114
00:05:59,661 --> 00:06:03,230
but here are some examples.
The Dutch diagraph Ij pronounced,

115
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:07,730
I became just a y in Afrikaans.
So we have the Dutch word could ice,

116
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:12,440
which is spelled like this in Africans,
but Dutch words ending with Lij,

117
00:06:12,441 --> 00:06:15,710
k pronounced as Lik are spelled l I K 
and Africans.

118
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:18,530
And that's a more accurate reflection of
the real pronunciation.

119
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:19,663
Lay Look.
Lilach Dutch t I o n became Sio iom in 

120
00:06:23,481 --> 00:06:24,314
Africans.
So we have the Dutch word not show now 

121
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,380
and this became the spelling and 
Africans,

122
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,553
these Dutch diphthongs,
which are actually pronounced 

123
00:06:32,241 --> 00:06:35,120
identically by many Dutch speakers,
all became spelled,

124
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,013
oh you in Afrikaans.
So the Dutch words and though are 

125
00:06:39,951 --> 00:06:42,830
spelled like this in Afrikaans,
though,

126
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,173
there are also some other spelling 
changes that represent new 

127
00:06:45,801 --> 00:06:48,290
pronunciations and Africans,
for example,

128
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:53,350
Afrikaans merged the Dutch consonants,Z
and s two a single celled spelt s so the

129
00:06:53,511 --> 00:06:54,344
Dutch word became so in Afrikaans,
a similar phonetic change can also be 

130
00:06:59,361 --> 00:07:02,750
found in the northern Netherlands,
but it's not represented in writing only

131
00:07:02,751 --> 00:07:05,120
in speech.
Afrikaans also merged together.

132
00:07:05,121 --> 00:07:05,954
The Dutch sounds represented by c h and 
g to a single sound spelled g and again 

133
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,020
a similar emerging also happened in the 
Netherlands,

134
00:07:12,021 --> 00:07:14,720
but not in spelling,
only in sound in Afrikaans.

135
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,810
When the g sound is proceeded by an 
estimate as written as sk.

136
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,840
So we have the Dutch word soul and the 
Africans word school between two vowels.

137
00:07:23,601 --> 00:07:26,780
The Dutch g and V consonants are omitted
in Africans.

138
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:28,370
Look at these Dutch words,
oh,

139
00:07:28,371 --> 00:07:29,204
hood that Ethan,
and now the Afrikaans equivalents the 

140
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:34,043
end.
Notice that the second vowel requires a 

141
00:07:35,871 --> 00:07:36,704
diacritic so that we know to pronounce 
these as two separate vowels and not as 

142
00:07:39,261 --> 00:07:41,420
one diphthong.
There are many more spelling changes,

143
00:07:41,421 --> 00:07:44,330
but those are a few examples to give you
a sense of how things changed.

144
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,253
Verbs,
the verb system and Afrikaans is quite 

145
00:07:46,761 --> 00:07:48,620
simple compared to Dutch.
First of all,

146
00:07:48,621 --> 00:07:52,880
the simple past isn't used except for 
eight basic verbs for all other verbs.

147
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:56,450
The perfect tense is used instead,
which is also a possible in Dutch too.

148
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,313
So here's the Dutch sentence,
meaning I watched a cake and now here's 

149
00:08:00,411 --> 00:08:02,050
the African sentence pack.

150
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:02,883
It's a cake.
So notice that we use the perfect tense 

151
00:08:04,581 --> 00:08:06,530
in Afrikaans because there is no past 
tense.

152
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,920
But this African sentence is similar to 
the Dutch perfect 10th sentence.

153
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:10,963
[inaudible].
But notice that the way the past 

154
00:08:13,131 --> 00:08:14,930
participle is formed is a little 
different.

155
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,750
Also notice that the form of the verb 
for have is different.

156
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,790
These are both the present tense form of
the verb,

157
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:23,570
meaning to have the one in Dutchess 
conjugated for first person singular,

158
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,390
but Africans verbs don't change 
according to person or a number.

159
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:28,610
So the Dutch verb will change and other 
sentences.

160
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,473
But in Afrikaans it will always be hate.
There was also no plu perfect tents in 

161
00:08:33,561 --> 00:08:36,800
Africans who perfect is like had watched
instead.

162
00:08:36,801 --> 00:08:37,634
The perfect form would be used.
So let's just jump into a few more 

163
00:08:39,921 --> 00:08:40,754
examples,
sentences and look at these differences 

164
00:08:42,051 --> 00:08:42,884
as well as some others.
The next sentences mean I talked to my 

165
00:08:45,111 --> 00:08:46,370
children in Dutch.

166
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:49,580
You kept mets men getting it into grouts
and an Afrikaans.

167
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:52,400
I could fit my goodness.
First of all,

168
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:53,263
notice the difference in personal 
pronouns in Dutch and an Afrikaans and 

169
00:08:57,661 --> 00:08:58,494
then notice the different forms of the 
verb meaning to have the next word met 

170
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,123
means width.
And next we can see that the possessive 

171
00:09:03,901 --> 00:09:08,040
pronouns are different in Dutch and an 
Afrikaans May.

172
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,233
Next is the word for children,
but notice that the plural form is 

173
00:09:11,641 --> 00:09:12,474
different.
Notice that the word order is exactly 

174
00:09:13,951 --> 00:09:17,100
the same and that the second verb goes 
at the end in Afrikaans,

175
00:09:17,101 --> 00:09:19,890
which is the same as in Dutch and also 
the same as in German.

176
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,860
The next sentences mean did you have a 
good new year?

177
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:27,950
First in Dutch have gi hooten,
new hub and an Afrikaans and English.

178
00:09:29,371 --> 00:09:32,550
It's like have you a good new year?
Head again.

179
00:09:32,551 --> 00:09:35,100
We see the different forms of the verb 
meaning to have.

180
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,560
Then we see the different spelling of 
the personal pronoun.

181
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,070
Yeah,
Yay.

182
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:40,290
Meaning you.
Then we have the indefinite article,

183
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,153
which has been shortened in Afrikaans.
Then notice that the word for good is 

184
00:09:43,621 --> 00:09:45,000
slightly different.
Then after that,

185
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,190
notice the slight difference in the 
words for a new year.

186
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:51,060
And finally the past participle of the 
verb meaning to have is the same in both

187
00:09:51,061 --> 00:09:53,070
sentences.
Now let's look at a similar sentence,

188
00:09:53,071 --> 00:09:53,904
but with a little change.
This one means did he have a good new 

189
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,820
year in Dutch?
Hey Cy,

190
00:09:57,821 --> 00:10:00,270
a hoot,
new Yamaha and an Afrikaans.

191
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:05,550
Look at the first word and notice that 
the Dutch verb conjugation changes.

192
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,800
This is the third person singular form 
of the verb.

193
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:08,943
The verb form stays the same in 
Afrikaans and next we see that the 

194
00:10:10,951 --> 00:10:11,784
personal pronoun,
high e meaning he is spelled 

195
00:10:13,621 --> 00:10:14,670
differently.
After that,

196
00:10:14,671 --> 00:10:17,280
the rest of the words are the same as in
the sentence is up above.

197
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,570
The next sentences mean we will live.
We will die in Dutch,

198
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:22,860
Missoula,
Lavan,

199
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:24,270
Zilla,
Stephan,

200
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:29,570
and in Afrikaans on Saul starbuck.
Notice here that the subject Pronoun for

201
00:10:30,091 --> 00:10:32,860
week is different in Dutch,
the subject pronouns as va,

202
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:35,910
but the object pronoun similar to us in 
English,

203
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:40,170
his aunts in Africans owns is both the 
subject and the object Pronoun.

204
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,420
Next,
notice that the future tense in Dutch is

205
00:10:42,421 --> 00:10:45,570
formed using Xulane plus the infinitive 
in Afrikaans.

206
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,040
It's formed by using sal plus the verb 
and there really isn't an infinitive and

207
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:51,930
Afrikaans,
so there's just one single verb form.

208
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,390
This part here is the same as the 
present tense form,

209
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,500
so we can see that there are some 
differences between Dutch and Africans,

210
00:10:58,501 --> 00:10:59,334
but generally the vocabulary is very 
similar and probably very easy to 

211
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:02,994
recognize.
Once you're aware of those general 

212
00:11:04,111 --> 00:11:06,870
differences and the word order is 
basically the same.

213
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:10,440
So how well can Dutch speakers and 
African speakers understand each other?

214
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,720
The answer to this question depends on 
who you ask,

215
00:11:12,721 --> 00:11:16,020
but generally they seem to be mutually 
intelligible to a moderate level.

216
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,033
With African speakers being able to 
understand the Dutch better than Dutch 

217
00:11:19,741 --> 00:11:21,420
speakers can understand.
Afrikaans,

218
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,180
there are a couple of important factors 
and intelligibility.

219
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:25,043
One of them is accent.
I've heard from a few Dutch people and 

220
00:11:27,211 --> 00:11:30,690
from a few Africans people that they can
understand certain speakers of the other

221
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:31,524
language very well but other speakers 
are a partner to understand and that 

222
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:35,394
might be because certain Dutch dialects 
have pronunciation that is more similar 

223
00:11:38,191 --> 00:11:39,024
to Africans than others and there are 
also a lot of second language speakers 

224
00:11:41,851 --> 00:11:42,684
of Afrikaans who's accent might be 
difficult for native Dutch speakers to 

225
00:11:45,181 --> 00:11:46,014
understand.
Another factor is register register 

226
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:48,543
means the level of formality used.
Now if the speakers of both languages 

227
00:11:51,301 --> 00:11:52,134
use the standard formal variety of their
language and they don't use any local 

228
00:11:55,271 --> 00:11:56,104
variations or slang,
then they'll probably understand each 

229
00:11:57,791 --> 00:11:58,600
other much better.

230
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,433
Formal speech basically resembles the 
written language and the speakers of 

231
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:04,750
either language can basically understand
the other one when it's written.

232
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:08,710
A common question that I see written on 
the Internet is should I learn Afrikaans

233
00:12:08,711 --> 00:12:09,544
before learning Dutch?
Would that help me to learn Dutch later 

234
00:12:11,621 --> 00:12:12,454
on?
I would say that that's probably a bad 

235
00:12:14,171 --> 00:12:17,350
idea to learn afrikaans just because you
want to learn Dutch later,

236
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:18,363
it's probably would end up confusing you
when you learn Dutch later on because 

237
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,830
Dutch is similar to Africans,
but more complex.

238
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,753
I would say that the best reason to 
learn Afrikaans would be because you 

239
00:12:26,651 --> 00:12:27,484
have a deep cultural interest in South 
Africa and you want to spend some time 

240
00:12:30,161 --> 00:12:30,994
in that country or in Namibia.
So the question of the day for speakers 

241
00:12:33,941 --> 00:12:34,774
of Africans and Dutch,
how well can you guys understand each 

242
00:12:36,941 --> 00:12:39,040
other?
Leave your comments and your experiences

243
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:40,870
down below.
And for everyone else,

244
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:42,363
I don't have a question of the day.
So why don't you ask a question to the 

245
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:46,690
Africans and Dutch speakers?
That sounds good.

246
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:49,030
Be sure to follow lane,
focus on facebook,

247
00:12:49,031 --> 00:12:50,410
twitter,
and instagram.

248
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,273
And I want to say thanks to all of my 
patrion supporters for continuing to 

249
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:54,874
make Lang focus possible.
Thank you for watching and have a nice 

250
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:58,563
day.
