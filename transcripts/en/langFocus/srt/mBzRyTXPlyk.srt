1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:01,403
Hey,
have you seen the new Leonardo Dicaprio 

2
00:00:02,581 --> 00:00:03,780
movie?
Man,

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:06,040
that guy is such a good actor.
He's so lucky.

4
00:00:06,041 --> 00:00:08,420
He's so lucky.
He has that talent is rich.

5
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:09,900
It doesn't even have to do any hard 
work.

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,513
Good afternoon everyone.
Today I'm going to talk about whether 

7
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,213
some people are naturally just good with
languages and other people are not good 

8
00:00:25,061 --> 00:00:25,894
with languages.
Usually when people hear about how I 

9
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,170
speak several different languages and I 
love studying languages,

10
00:00:32,171 --> 00:00:33,670
they often say to me,
wow,

11
00:00:33,671 --> 00:00:35,310
you're so lucky you can speak those 
languages.

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,040
Now.
That's kind of makes me laugh usually,

13
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:42,160
but it's also kind of annoying because 
I'm not lucky.

14
00:00:42,161 --> 00:00:44,680
I worked really hard to learn all of 
those languages,

15
00:00:44,681 --> 00:00:45,514
but people don't really see that.
Sometimes they just see the final 

16
00:00:47,771 --> 00:00:48,604
result,
which is that I can speak these 

17
00:00:49,631 --> 00:00:52,390
languages.
They don't see all of the effort and the

18
00:00:52,391 --> 00:00:55,420
process that went into it.
They just see that final,

19
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:58,060
uh,
the final result and they think,

20
00:00:58,061 --> 00:00:59,110
oh,
I couldn't do that.

21
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,770
So they think that it's somehow,
it just a natural talent that I have.

22
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:05,020
But actually I'm not talented with 
languages.

23
00:01:05,021 --> 00:01:05,854
I just love studying languages and 
that's why I can easily put in the time 

24
00:01:09,401 --> 00:01:13,570
and I can kind of slug through all of 
the grind to get good at a language.

25
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:16,180
People who say I'm not good with 
languages,

26
00:01:16,181 --> 00:01:19,330
they usually have no idea what goes into
the process.

27
00:01:19,331 --> 00:01:20,164
They don't realize that it takes 
hundreds and hundreds of hours to get 

28
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:23,643
pretty good with the language and it 
takes thousands of hours to get really 

29
00:01:26,741 --> 00:01:27,574
good at a language.
Probably they hear about people getting 

30
00:01:30,101 --> 00:01:33,070
good at a language in three months or in
six months and they think,

31
00:01:33,071 --> 00:01:35,290
wow,
that's really a short period of time.

32
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,710
It sounds easy and they buy in to the 
marketing and all that kind of thing.

33
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:39,873
Um,
but they don't realize that within that 

34
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:42,903
short amount of time,
people who get good at a language or 

35
00:01:44,981 --> 00:01:45,814
probably just completely focused and 
dedicated and obsessed with that 

36
00:01:49,091 --> 00:01:49,450
language.

37
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:52,030
Like if you get good at a language in 
six months and you're fluent,

38
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:52,893
that means you busted your ass that 
whole six months and that language 

39
00:01:55,571 --> 00:01:57,480
became your life.
Uh,

40
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,980
learning a language is like climbing a 
mountain,

41
00:01:59,981 --> 00:02:00,980
right?
Um,

42
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:04,330
it's a struggle and it's a challenge 
every step of the way.

43
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:05,403
But that's why it's fun.
So some people endure that grind and 

44
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:09,874
endured the challenge because they love 
it or because they're really motivated 

45
00:02:12,251 --> 00:02:13,084
by that goal of reaching the top.
And it's the same as people who climb 

46
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:17,560
real mountains.
Why did they climb it?

47
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,423
Not because it's easy,
but the climate because they love the 

48
00:02:21,311 --> 00:02:25,300
challenge or they really enjoy getting 
to the top of the mountain,

49
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:27,790
right?
So it's not that it's easy,

50
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:28,624
it's that some people just love the 
challenge and that's why they can stick 

51
00:02:31,181 --> 00:02:32,620
it out and they can grind through it.

52
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,890
And that's why they can put in the time 
and the effort to get really good at it.

53
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:41,020
So some people are not good at languages
because they have bad habits,

54
00:02:41,021 --> 00:02:41,854
bad study habits,
or just bad habits of hard work in 

55
00:02:44,441 --> 00:02:45,274
general,
or they have bad strategies for 

56
00:02:46,571 --> 00:02:48,640
learning.
Both of those are things you can change.

57
00:02:48,641 --> 00:02:52,450
So people can get good with languages 
even if they're not right.

58
00:02:52,451 --> 00:02:53,284
Now,
let me tell you just a couple of 

59
00:02:55,081 --> 00:02:55,914
examples.
Like,

60
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:56,903
uh,
one guy who I used to work with at my 

61
00:02:57,911 --> 00:02:59,770
previous job,
he told me,

62
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,331
uh,
well,

63
00:03:00,331 --> 00:03:01,164
I,
I can speak Japanese quite well and he 

64
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,950
can't speak Japanese very well.
And he was saying to me,

65
00:03:05,951 --> 00:03:07,660
Oh,
I wish I could speak at like you.

66
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:08,523
And I said,
well,

67
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:10,150
why don't you do it then?
And he said,

68
00:03:10,151 --> 00:03:10,990
well,
I've tried,

69
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:14,090
but I'm not good with languages,
which made my eyebrows raise.

70
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:15,040
Like,
really?

71
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,990
How much do you study?
And he said,

72
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:17,861
well,
I study,

73
00:03:17,861 --> 00:03:19,270
you know,
when I have time.

74
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:22,270
And that was the first red flag.
It was just when I have time,

75
00:03:22,271 --> 00:03:24,970
that's an excuse to not commit to a 
study schedule.

76
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:25,871
So I said,
well,

77
00:03:25,871 --> 00:03:26,800
how often?
He said,

78
00:03:26,801 --> 00:03:28,510
well,
once or twice a week sometimes.

79
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,501
Uh,
and I said,

80
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:31,510
okay,
when you study on those days,

81
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:32,710
how much do you study?
And he says,

82
00:03:32,711 --> 00:03:33,544
well,
I try to do a page or two and my 

83
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:36,130
textbook,
I said,

84
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:39,460
what do you mean try?
Do you do a page or two or we're not?

85
00:03:39,461 --> 00:03:40,300
And he said,
well,

86
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,490
sometimes.
And so all these things,

87
00:03:42,491 --> 00:03:45,290
like you sometimes do a page or two,
uh,

88
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,380
you tried to do a page or two,
what does that mean?

89
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:48,850
You either do it or you don't.

90
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:53,303
There is no try.
So if you're going to do three pages 

91
00:03:55,901 --> 00:03:57,040
today,
do three pages,

92
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:58,840
don't do a page and then go on,
I'm tired,

93
00:03:58,841 --> 00:03:59,980
I'm going to go watch TV.
No,

94
00:03:59,981 --> 00:04:03,310
screw that you do your three pages.
That's the kind of commitment.

95
00:04:03,311 --> 00:04:06,040
That's the kind of habit that you need 
to get good at a language.

96
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:06,874
It's that ability to just set a goal and
fight through it because you enjoy it 

97
00:04:10,181 --> 00:04:13,180
and because you want to reach that,
that goal at the end,

98
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,400
and that's part of the process is just 
committing to it.

99
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:19,090
So some people can force themselves to 
do that and those are the people who are

100
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,610
supposedly good with languages for the 
most part.

101
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:26,770
Another example is someone who has just 
a kind of habit or a learning style or a

102
00:04:27,431 --> 00:04:31,030
personality trait that kind of blocks 
them from getting good at the language.

103
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:34,330
I know another guy who tried to learn 
Japanese,

104
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,050
kind of tried to learn Japanese,
but he never made any progress with it.

105
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:40,060
Um,
and I would always ask them,

106
00:04:40,061 --> 00:04:40,840
how's it going?
He said,

107
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,160
oh,
it's not so easy.

108
00:04:42,161 --> 00:04:45,760
I'm not good with languages like you.
And I would dig in a little bit.

109
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,110
And what it is is this guy just loves to
talk your ear off.

110
00:04:50,111 --> 00:04:51,700
He's one of these people who just talks,
talks,

111
00:04:51,701 --> 00:04:52,181
talks,
talks,

112
00:04:52,181 --> 00:04:55,540
talks all the time really fast.
And he can't slow himself down.

113
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:58,540
And he absolutely hates listening to 
other people.

114
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:01,490
Like stopping his own voice to listen to
other people is,

115
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,420
it causes him like psychological terror 
almost.

116
00:05:04,421 --> 00:05:05,670
He just hates it.
Um,

117
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,753
so he's not someone who can slow himself
down enough to really go slowly when 

118
00:05:10,961 --> 00:05:11,794
learning a language.
He has to just say all his ideas right 

119
00:05:13,811 --> 00:05:15,280
away or he feels freaked out.

120
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,353
So when you're learning a language,
of course you need to sometimes go 

121
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,600
slowly.
You need to,

122
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,793
you know,
uh,

123
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:21,693
process the concepts,
process the patterns and piece together 

124
00:05:23,891 --> 00:05:26,080
your sentences.
You need to just,

125
00:05:26,081 --> 00:05:26,914
um,
you need to slow down to make your 

126
00:05:28,271 --> 00:05:31,120
speech more accurate.
And if you are not used to doing that,

127
00:05:31,121 --> 00:05:35,170
if you have a personality trait that 
inhibits you from slowing down,

128
00:05:35,171 --> 00:05:37,060
and that means you need to change that 
strategy,

129
00:05:37,061 --> 00:05:42,061
you need to work on that part of your,
of your personality in order to help you

130
00:05:42,131 --> 00:05:43,480
learn better,
right?

131
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:46,420
So it's not that that guy is not good 
with languages is that he,

132
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,100
he has this,
uh,

133
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:51,430
this pattern of behavior that stops him 
from,

134
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,160
from pushing forward in his learning,
right?

135
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,173
So if he can work on that,
then he can get better with learning 

136
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:57,913
languages.
So if you have trouble learning 

137
00:05:59,121 --> 00:06:01,490
languages,
it could be one of those two things.

138
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:02,323
It could be that you don't have the 
study habits so you don't have the 

139
00:06:04,821 --> 00:06:05,654
habits of setting goals and just 
fighting through all of the bullshit 

140
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,460
that you have to go through to reach 
your goal.

141
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,650
Or it could be that you have some kind 
of,

142
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:13,830
some kind of,
um,

143
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:15,163
uh,
trait or some kind of pattern that's 

144
00:06:16,731 --> 00:06:19,520
inhibiting your learning and you can 
figure out what that is.

145
00:06:19,521 --> 00:06:20,354
And try to work around that or try to 
change it so you can learn more 

146
00:06:23,031 --> 00:06:25,190
efficiently and not have to keep 
stopping.

147
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,533
So that's my basic message.
If you think you're not good with 

148
00:06:28,431 --> 00:06:29,264
languages,
I basically disagree with you and I 

149
00:06:31,701 --> 00:06:32,534
think you could be good with languages 
if you just change something around and 

150
00:06:36,111 --> 00:06:38,300
change your patterns,
change your habits.
