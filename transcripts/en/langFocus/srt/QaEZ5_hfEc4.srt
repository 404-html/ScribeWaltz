1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,190
So it turns out I have to take a 
language,

2
00:00:02,191 --> 00:00:03,024
credit and university,
so I'm going to take the easiest 

3
00:00:05,191 --> 00:00:06,390
language in the world.

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:17,713
Good day everyone.
One of the most common questions about 

5
00:00:20,301 --> 00:00:23,330
language learning is what is the easiest
language to learn?

6
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:24,793
Now there is no exact answer to that 
question that applies to everyone 

7
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:30,290
because it depends on a few different 
factors.

8
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:33,560
So the factors,
it depends on or your native language,

9
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:34,603
any other languages you happened to have
learned and also the complexity of the 

10
00:00:38,691 --> 00:00:39,524
language in question.
So if your native language is English 

11
00:00:42,861 --> 00:00:47,360
than the easiest language for you is 
probably the one that's the most similar

12
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:48,750
to English.
Uh,

13
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:49,653
and if it's not,
then maybe you've learned another 

14
00:00:50,931 --> 00:00:53,420
language.
Like if you've learned French,

15
00:00:53,421 --> 00:00:54,254
then maybe the language that's easiest 
for you to learn as the one that's most 

16
00:00:57,051 --> 00:00:57,884
similar to French because you've already
learned a lot of the concepts of those 

17
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,060
that those languages have in common.
So you've already done a lot of the work

18
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:06,140
in the past already.

19
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:08,750
Okay?
So it could be your native language,

20
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:10,670
the one that's closest to your native 
language,

21
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,350
closest to other languages you've 
learned,

22
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:17,060
and it also another factor is the 
complexity of that language.

23
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:19,880
So it could be a language that's similar
to your own,

24
00:01:19,881 --> 00:01:22,880
but if that language happens to be quite
complex,

25
00:01:22,881 --> 00:01:23,714
then maybe that's not the easiest one.
So it's kind of a balance of those 

26
00:01:26,031 --> 00:01:28,010
different factors.
So it's.

27
00:01:28,011 --> 00:01:28,844
There's no precise formula,
but we have an idea just from those 

28
00:01:32,751 --> 00:01:37,751
factors now the American Foreign Service
Institute that trains American diplomats

29
00:01:38,421 --> 00:01:39,254
to go overseas,
what trains them in language skills 

30
00:01:41,121 --> 00:01:45,560
before their placement overseas.
They've done a lot of research into this

31
00:01:45,561 --> 00:01:46,394
topic as it relates to English speakers 
because they're training their American 

32
00:01:50,061 --> 00:01:52,370
staff to go abroad.
So they're English speakers,

33
00:01:52,371 --> 00:01:53,204
but they're learning other languages.
So they have a lot of data about how 

34
00:01:55,731 --> 00:01:59,930
many hours it takes,
about how intensively they have to study

35
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:02,330
these different groups of languages.

36
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,940
So they have it categorized into four 
different groups.

37
00:02:04,941 --> 00:02:07,640
Is Category One,
which are the easiest languages to learn

38
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,100
for native English speakers than they've
got two,

39
00:02:10,101 --> 00:02:10,641
three,
four,

40
00:02:10,641 --> 00:02:14,840
and then five is the.
The group of most difficult languages to

41
00:02:14,841 --> 00:02:18,890
learn and those people studying those 
languages study for I believe,

42
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,753
88 weeks full time.
So that's like 88 weeks I guess a year 

43
00:02:23,661 --> 00:02:25,130
and a half,
something like that.

44
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,233
Um,
people who study the category one 

45
00:02:27,651 --> 00:02:31,130
languages I think are in there for 23 or
24 weeks full time.

46
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:35,690
So it's almost times four if you learn a
level five language.

47
00:02:35,691 --> 00:02:39,290
So which ones are in level one the 
easiest category?

48
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:40,124
They are uh,
the Germanic languages such as a Dutch 

49
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:45,583
Africans,
the northern Germanic languages from 

50
00:02:46,851 --> 00:02:48,410
Scandinavia,
Sweden,

51
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,940
a Swedish or Norwegian and Danish not 
finished.

52
00:02:52,941 --> 00:02:53,774
That's separate language group.
And then you've got the romance 

53
00:02:56,331 --> 00:02:57,164
languages like French and Spanish,
Italian and Portuguese and I believe 

54
00:03:00,911 --> 00:03:02,740
also Romanian is in there.

55
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,370
So those ones are the most closely 
related to English.

56
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:07,773
You've got the dramatic ones like Dutch 
and Afrikaans and I think those are 

57
00:03:10,751 --> 00:03:14,680
probably the most closely related to 
English and the easiest to learn.

58
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,020
I haven't actually studied those 
personally,

59
00:03:17,021 --> 00:03:20,560
but a lot of people say that Dutch is 
the easiest for English speakers.

60
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:21,783
I have studied French and French has 
been the easiest language that I have 

61
00:03:26,261 --> 00:03:29,770
personally studied.
I used to think it was Indonesia because

62
00:03:29,771 --> 00:03:30,604
Indonesia is really simple and really 
straightforward and I made really fast 

63
00:03:33,431 --> 00:03:34,264
progress in it and I could communicate 
an Indonesian after studying for just a 

64
00:03:37,781 --> 00:03:39,780
couple of months before a trip.
Uh,

65
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:40,953
but when I started to study French I 
realized how much of an advantage that 

66
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,213
shared vocabulary is because English 
vocabulary is something like 35 percent 

67
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:50,374
French.
So when I would look at a French text I 

68
00:03:52,091 --> 00:03:52,924
would recognize a lot of the keywords 
already and I can basically understand 

69
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,020
half of the text without ever having 
studied French.

70
00:03:59,020 --> 00:03:59,853
So after a few weeks I could basically 
read and after a few months I could 

71
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:08,190
communicate and speak not fluently,
but I could make myself understood and I

72
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:12,700
could understand pretty much whatever 
was said to me face to face,

73
00:04:12,701 --> 00:04:15,010
at least not on the radio and not third 
person,

74
00:04:15,011 --> 00:04:15,844
but face to face I could understand.
So French has been definitely the 

75
00:04:18,821 --> 00:04:20,710
easiest one for me.
Category too,

76
00:04:20,711 --> 00:04:22,990
by the way,
consists of only German.

77
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,720
German is a dramatic language.
Just like that,

78
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:26,563
sure.
Afrikaans and it's closely related to 

79
00:04:27,761 --> 00:04:28,594
English,
but it's also quite complex 

80
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:32,283
grammatically.
It's not that complicated from what I 

81
00:04:34,571 --> 00:04:37,360
hear,
but it does have some complications like

82
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,110
a grammatical case endings that,
uh,

83
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:44,410
other Germanic languages don't have.
And that's why it's not in category one.

84
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:45,483
It's a little bit more complex than the 
category one languages that puts it in 

85
00:04:48,701 --> 00:04:49,534
category two.
And I believe it's the only language in 

86
00:04:51,761 --> 00:04:52,594
category two,
so it's kind of off on its own because 

87
00:04:55,151 --> 00:04:58,150
it's related to English,
but a little bit complicated.

88
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:03,160
The hardest has been Japanese by far.
Um,

89
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:04,203
and that's one of the category five 
languages according to the Foreign 

90
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:11,110
Service Institute.
Now what makes Japanese so hard is first

91
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:11,944
of all,
the grammatic grammar is very different 

92
00:05:13,451 --> 00:05:16,240
from English.
It's about as different as you can get.

93
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,553
And also the writing system is extremely
complex and I think that the Fsi 

94
00:05:22,661 --> 00:05:25,930
categorization of level five doesn't 
even take into account.

95
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:28,210
The writing system is just the spoken 
language.

96
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:31,810
It matches my experience with French 
versus Japanese.

97
00:05:31,811 --> 00:05:32,644
It's feel,
it feels to me like it took about five 

98
00:05:34,451 --> 00:05:39,451
times as long to get conversant in 
Japanese as it did with French,

99
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,533
about five times as long.
But then the writing system on top of 

100
00:05:42,821 --> 00:05:47,821
that takes a lot longer than that,
maybe 10 times or 20 times or 30 times,

101
00:05:48,311 --> 00:05:49,144
as long as,
as it takes to learn to read French to 

102
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:54,100
read and write French because it,
you're learning for different,

103
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:55,303
uh,
writing systems and combining them 

104
00:05:56,381 --> 00:05:56,830
together.

105
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:01,130
You're idiographic pictures.
Those are the Chinese characters.

106
00:06:01,131 --> 00:06:01,964
Congee,
those are very complicated and there's 

107
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:06,410
2000 of them that you need just to read 
a book comfortably.

108
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:09,320
Uh,
and they're read in different ways.

109
00:06:09,321 --> 00:06:10,940
There's different pronunciations for 
each one.

110
00:06:10,941 --> 00:06:14,150
So learning Japanese is a real longterm 
intensive thing.

111
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,000
So it's been the hardest for me a 
second.

112
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:17,834
So that will be Arabic because when you 
learn Arabic you're learning not only 

113
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:23,090
one language,
you're learning the formal language,

114
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:27,020
which is kind of outdated,
archaic language.

115
00:06:27,021 --> 00:06:29,540
But then you have to learn a dialect at 
the same time.

116
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:30,374
And then you have to learn how to 
communicate with speakers of other 

117
00:06:32,631 --> 00:06:33,464
dialects.
So with Arabic you're learning a whole 

118
00:06:35,331 --> 00:06:37,820
language family,
that's what makes it hard.

119
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,193
Uh,
but the easiest has definitely been 

120
00:06:40,101 --> 00:06:43,010
French followed by Indonesian because of
its simplicity.

121
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:44,840
A Indonesian,
by the way,

122
00:06:44,841 --> 00:06:48,410
is a category three language according 
to Fsi.

123
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,380
Obviously it's one of the more simple 
languages,

124
00:06:51,381 --> 00:06:56,381
but it doesn't have that shared 
vocabulary that with English that French

125
00:06:56,661 --> 00:07:00,710
or Spanish or Italian or,
or Dutch or Africans would have.

126
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,040
That's why it's not in category one,
even though it's very simple.

127
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:06,020
Anyway,
I hope that was helpful.

128
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,333
I hope that gave you an understanding 
and I hope you're not choosing the 

129
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:12,860
language to study just based on how easy
it is.

130
00:07:12,861 --> 00:07:15,740
I hope you are just interested in 
getting that information.

131
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,330
All right.
Have a good night.

132
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,223
See you later.
