00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,700
Hello everyone,
welcome to the focus channel and my name

2
00:00:03,701 --> 00:00:08,701
is Paul.
Hi everyone.

3
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:10,603
Welcome to my home and today we're going
to look at how I make a lang focus 

4
00:00:14,031 --> 00:00:14,864
video.

5
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:28,303
You know,
it seems like people think I exist 

6
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:30,553
inside a video.
Sometimes I'm walking down the street 

7
00:00:32,601 --> 00:00:35,360
and someone sees me and I can tell that 
they recognize me,

8
00:00:35,361 --> 00:00:37,910
but 90 percent of the time they don't 
actually talk to me.

9
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:40,400
They just stare at me confused like,
Hey,

10
00:00:40,401 --> 00:00:43,460
isn't that the computer simulated 
humanoid from Lang Focus?

11
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:44,413
Maybe that's because most of my videos 
aren't just me sitting in front of the 

12
00:00:46,971 --> 00:00:50,630
camera and talking to the camera.
I put a lot of effort into crafting each

13
00:00:50,631 --> 00:00:54,470
video and producing it and basically 
creating a new little world that you can

14
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:55,304
step into today.
I'm basically taking you behind the 

15
00:00:57,381 --> 00:00:58,214
curtain and I'm showing you all the 
different steps in that process of 

16
00:01:00,801 --> 00:01:02,360
creating a length focus video.

17
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:08,380
So the first thing that I have to do 
when making a video is choose a topic.

18
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:12,970
Now I have a long list of topics in a 
word document that I keep on my computer

19
00:01:12,971 --> 00:01:13,804
and in dropbox and I add topics to that 
list whenever I get a new idea that 

20
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:18,244
excites me and for the next couple of 
months I always have a short list of 

21
00:01:22,391 --> 00:01:25,030
topics,
a short list of topics that I want to do

22
00:01:25,031 --> 00:01:25,864
in the near future,
topics that are currently on my mind or 

23
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,730
excite me or motivate me to make a 
video,

24
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:35,320
and then once I finish one video,
I look at the shortlist and I choose the

25
00:01:35,321 --> 00:01:37,960
next video and I think which one excites
me the most?

26
00:01:37,961 --> 00:01:40,120
Which one do I really want to do right 
now?

27
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:44,410
Now the reason I do it like that is 
because it really takes a lot of work to

28
00:01:44,411 --> 00:01:45,244
get through one of my videos.
So if I'm not really excited about the 

29
00:01:47,561 --> 00:01:50,590
topic or if I don't want to learn about 
the topic for myself,

30
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:51,723
then it's just torture to get through 
the time and effort required to make a 

31
00:01:54,731 --> 00:01:55,451
video.
Now,

32
00:01:55,451 --> 00:01:58,960
just as an example for this video,
let's say that I'm choosing a topic.

33
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:02,980
Let's say I'm choosing the languages of 
Canada because that's the topic that I'm

34
00:02:02,981 --> 00:02:03,814
really excited about right now.
That's really not one of the topics on 

35
00:02:06,371 --> 00:02:08,290
my shortlist,
but let's just say it is.

36
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,330
The next step is research.

37
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:15,893
Nope,
I'm not an expert in every topic that I 

38
00:02:17,491 --> 00:02:18,324
cover.
My videos are basically like projects 

39
00:02:20,191 --> 00:02:21,024
and I researched the projects.
I dig into the topic and I learned as 

40
00:02:23,701 --> 00:02:24,534
much about it for myself as I can and I 
share it with you as a way of learning 

41
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,520
for myself.
Of course,

42
00:02:29,521 --> 00:02:30,354
sometimes I have background in the topic
if it's a language I've studied or I've 

43
00:02:33,031 --> 00:02:33,864
read about before,
but that's not always the case and even 

44
00:02:36,391 --> 00:02:40,140
when it's a language I'm familiar with,
I usually dig in and learn things that I

45
00:02:40,141 --> 00:02:43,890
didn't know before making the video and 
it's important for people to know that I

46
00:02:43,891 --> 00:02:47,640
don't like people thinking I'm sort of 
linguistic superman when I'm not.

47
00:02:47,641 --> 00:02:48,474
I'm just a regular guy who's interested 
in languages and likes to learn more 

48
00:02:51,241 --> 00:02:52,074
about them.

49
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:54,963
So back to the topic of research in the 
comments for every video there's always 

50
00:02:58,541 --> 00:02:59,740
some person says,
hey,

51
00:02:59,741 --> 00:03:02,560
you just copied wikipedia.
No,

52
00:03:02,561 --> 00:03:03,394
not quite bro,
but I often do start by reading a 

53
00:03:05,861 --> 00:03:06,694
wikipedia article on the topic just to 
get a general sense of it and basically 

54
00:03:10,001 --> 00:03:12,670
to see what kinds of things I want to 
learn about it,

55
00:03:12,671 --> 00:03:13,504
what kinds of questions I want to ask 
and find the answers to and more 

56
00:03:16,391 --> 00:03:19,030
reliable sources.
So for this dummy topic,

57
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:19,923
the languages of Canada,
we're looking right now at a wikipedia 

58
00:03:22,031 --> 00:03:25,750
entry and I can see some types of 
information that I'd like to look up,

59
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:26,733
but for this topic I knew immediately 
right off the bat that I would need to 

60
00:03:29,231 --> 00:03:30,064
look at the stat can website that 
Statistics Canada because it has 

61
00:03:33,251 --> 00:03:34,084
information on the number of speakers of
different languages and a statistics on 

62
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:39,940
immigration to Canada and that sort of 
thing.

63
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:43,480
And that's the kind of official source 
that I like to use whenever possible.

64
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:44,523
Whenever researching,
there are new questions that come to 

65
00:03:46,331 --> 00:03:49,330
mind and I use good old google to find 
the answers.

66
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:50,403
I normally look at lots of different 
sources while keeping my eyes open for 

67
00:03:53,381 --> 00:03:54,214
academic sources,
and that includes published books as 

68
00:03:56,141 --> 00:03:56,974
well as academic papers on the subject.
This is especially true when dealing 

69
00:04:00,251 --> 00:04:01,084
with history or historical linguistics 
or when researching a language that 

70
00:04:04,601 --> 00:04:07,690
isn't very widely studied,
so there aren't a lot of materials about

71
00:04:07,691 --> 00:04:09,130
that language.
For example,

72
00:04:09,131 --> 00:04:09,964
when I made my video on Kurdish,
I almost exclusively used academic 

73
00:04:13,001 --> 00:04:16,800
sources because there aren't that many 
commercial sources dedicated to learning

74
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,840
Kurdish when dealing with a more widely 
studied language.

75
00:04:19,841 --> 00:04:22,660
I often use language learning books,
the commercial type,

76
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:26,770
because I have a lot of these at home 
and they're a good source of information

77
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,670
about the language.

78
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:31,270
I also use phrase books a lot.
I have a lot of these as well.

79
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:36,520
Phrase books are good because they 
helped you to learn inductively.

80
00:04:36,521 --> 00:04:40,570
If you're that type of thinker and you'd
like to just look at examples and figure

81
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:42,970
out how the language works based on 
examples.

82
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,833
Phrase books are really good for that,
so that's basically what I'm doing when 

83
00:04:47,021 --> 00:04:50,440
I analyze sentences in the videos,
when I break down the sentences,

84
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:52,860
I'm basically doing what I do with 
phrasebooks.

85
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:53,733
I'm looking at the sentences and 
figuring out what all the different 

86
00:04:55,871 --> 00:04:58,120
parts of the sentence mean.
While researching.

87
00:04:58,121 --> 00:05:01,270
I often use regular nonacademic websites
as well,

88
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,553
for example,
commercial websites or just websites 

89
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:06,003
written by someone who's very interested
in that language and has knowledge of 

90
00:05:08,351 --> 00:05:09,184
it,
but when I use regular websites like 

91
00:05:10,481 --> 00:05:13,090
that,
I look at a wide range of them and I try

92
00:05:13,091 --> 00:05:13,924
to make sure that the information I use 
is backed up by all the different 

93
00:05:17,081 --> 00:05:17,500
sources.

94
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,840
I try to make sure the information is 
consistent,

95
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:23,020
but it's important to point out that 
when dealing with linguistics,

96
00:05:23,021 --> 00:05:27,070
there's always quite a bit of variety of
information and there are some different

97
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,710
opinions and there's different data 
depending on the source.

98
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,080
Even when you're looking at academic 
sources,

99
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:37,240
the next step is writing for almost 
every video.

100
00:05:37,241 --> 00:05:38,074
I write a script.
I don't stick to the script 100 percent 

101
00:05:40,571 --> 00:05:41,404
of the time.
I use the script as a sort of skeleton 

102
00:05:43,391 --> 00:05:44,224
for what I'm going to say and then I can
veer off of that and I can ad Lib and 

103
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,440
change things a little bit while I'm 
filming the video,

104
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:51,363
but I do always have a script or almost 
always have a script that I worked from 

105
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:56,343
the difficulty of writing the script 
basically depends on the complexity of 

106
00:05:59,391 --> 00:06:00,224
the topic and research.
I try to present the information to you 

107
00:06:02,601 --> 00:06:04,220
as efficiently as possible.

108
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,690
Basically presenting you as much 
information as I can in a shorter period

109
00:06:08,691 --> 00:06:11,960
of time as possible while keeping it as 
clear as possible.

110
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:14,960
So I really tried to cut things down to 
the core takeaway,

111
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:15,823
anything unnecessary and make sure that 
everything I present is linked to the 

112
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:23,921
other information and basically I try to
make it easy for myself to understand.

113
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,650
I'm someone who gets easily overwhelmed 
by a lot of detail,

114
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:28,693
so I basically rewrite the script until 
I can understand it and if I can 

115
00:06:32,241 --> 00:06:33,350
understand it,
then I get.

116
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,213
I guess that you can understand it as 
well because I know that I get easily 

117
00:06:37,281 --> 00:06:38,114
overwhelmed.
The next step is to actually film the 

118
00:06:40,551 --> 00:06:41,271
video.
Now,

119
00:06:41,271 --> 00:06:44,540
some people think that this is the 
entire video creation process,

120
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:46,280
but no,
this is the easy part.

121
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:51,020
This is the least time consuming part.
Filming the video usually takes under an

122
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:51,853
hour,
but it can take up to about 90 minutes 

123
00:06:53,391 --> 00:06:57,320
depending on how long the video is.
So here we're looking at my studio.

124
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,213
Really,
it's just an extra bedroom that I 

125
00:06:59,451 --> 00:07:00,284
converted into a studio and I set up a 
green screen that my camera and lights 

126
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,633
and I actually moved last year.
I moved into a bigger apartment so that 

127
00:07:06,951 --> 00:07:08,720
I could set up a studio like this.

128
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:20,350
This is the camera that I used to film 
my videos until early 2017.

129
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:25,380
It's a Canon Ivis h f r 52.
It's a fairly affordable,

130
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,820
um,
cam quarter.

131
00:07:27,821 --> 00:07:28,654
It costs about $300 I guess,
and it's fairly easy to use except that 

132
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,153
it's difficult to get the focus right.
And a lot of people used to comment on 

133
00:07:35,891 --> 00:07:38,320
my video saying,
why is your face out of focus?

134
00:07:38,321 --> 00:07:41,590
Or why is this lang focus if you are not
in focus?

135
00:07:41,591 --> 00:07:43,020
And that kind of thing.
Um,

136
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:47,200
so I really had to get a new camera as 
soon as I could afford to do so.

137
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,150
This one right here is my current 
camera.

138
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,223
It's a Sony cyber shots are x 100,
it costs about a thousand dollars and 

139
00:07:54,221 --> 00:07:56,350
it's much better to focus as much 
better.

140
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,090
And just in general,
it's a great camera.

141
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,373
The only thing that I have a problem 
with is that digital cameras like this 

142
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:05,110
usually time out after 30 minutes of 
video.

143
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:06,123
So sometimes I'm in the middle of 
filming and I don't realize that 30 

144
00:08:08,831 --> 00:08:09,664
minutes have passed.
And then later when I checked the video 

145
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:13,810
file,
I see that the ending was cut off.

146
00:08:13,811 --> 00:08:15,820
So I have to refilm part of the video.

147
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,880
The hardest part about filming is the 
lighting.

148
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:22,510
Knowing where to put the lights,
how close I should be to the lights,

149
00:08:22,511 --> 00:08:23,800
um,
how bright they should be,

150
00:08:23,801 --> 00:08:26,050
what kind of light bulbs to use,
that sort of thing.

151
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,260
You guys probably don't notice it when 
you watch youtube videos,

152
00:08:29,261 --> 00:08:33,130
but lighting is essential.
I actually have two lights near me right

153
00:08:33,131 --> 00:08:33,964
now.
There's this one over here and there's 

154
00:08:34,721 --> 00:08:36,660
another one in front of me,
uh,

155
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:41,790
just outside of this room.
Let's just warm up for a minute and talk

156
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:42,883
and talk and talk and talk some more and
then get into talking with this clear 

157
00:08:47,781 --> 00:08:50,700
voice while I'm breathing so that I 
don't hyperventilate.

158
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,633
I am right now.
And just get into it normally as I 

159
00:08:53,651 --> 00:08:55,530
always do.
Okay.

160
00:08:55,531 --> 00:08:57,150
Just going to talk for a minute,
get warmed up,

161
00:08:57,151 --> 00:09:00,780
get into the zone so I can speak 
normally as I always do on camera,

162
00:09:00,781 --> 00:09:01,614
just like this,
except this time it's going to be about 

163
00:09:03,391 --> 00:09:04,224
French,
which isn't really different than usual 

164
00:09:06,121 --> 00:09:06,954
except that the topic is different and 
that's why I'm just doing another video 

165
00:09:10,411 --> 00:09:11,040
just like this.

166
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,873
It's no different than usual except that
I'm wearing a blue shirt and the green 

167
00:09:14,051 --> 00:09:16,140
screen is behind me,
but that's the same.

168
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:20,340
And I've got this time.
I'm not going to hold the phone in front

169
00:09:20,341 --> 00:09:21,174
of the camera.
I'm going to be very careful not to do 

170
00:09:22,561 --> 00:09:24,510
that.
And it's also hot in this room.

171
00:09:24,511 --> 00:09:29,511
So I have some water and I have a towel 
just in case I start to sweat a lot.

172
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,220
Hopefully that won't be a problem in 
this video.

173
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:37,310
I guess we'll see while filming a video,
I usually have my iphone in my hand.

174
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:38,773
Sometimes you might see my iphone pop up
into the screen when I fail to keep my 

175
00:09:41,931 --> 00:09:45,560
hands down low where they should be.
I use the iphone for two things.

176
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:46,453
First of all,
I have a script on the screen which I 

177
00:09:49,191 --> 00:09:52,910
refer to when necessary.
And also it connects to a microphone.

178
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:56,330
You can see right here,
I'm wearing a level II or microphone.

179
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,193
This is the smart lab.
This is the rode smartlav leveling or 

180
00:10:01,131 --> 00:10:02,810
microphone,
which is quite good,

181
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,740
uh,
cost about $100 button.

182
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,940
It gets something near to studio 
quality.

183
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:08,983
So I quite like it and I use the road 
recording app on the iphone and you can 

184
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:19,370
see that that the audio file is being 
recorded as I speak right now.

185
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,233
And later I can use dropbox to deliver 
the file to my computer and then pop it 

186
00:10:23,901 --> 00:10:26,810
into the editing software.
And it's all very easy.

187
00:10:26,811 --> 00:10:27,644
And convenient,

188
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:33,610
the next step is to find the images that
I want to include in the video,

189
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:37,990
so I read through the script and I tried
to imagine what kind of images I want to

190
00:10:37,991 --> 00:10:38,824
include,
what kind of images should accompany my 

191
00:10:40,451 --> 00:10:41,284
voice and the narration.
This includes background images like 

192
00:10:43,631 --> 00:10:47,770
scenery or maps or sometimes a photos of
people from a certain country.

193
00:10:47,771 --> 00:10:51,070
If I'm talking about that country,
sometimes historical photos,

194
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,890
that kind of thing.
I often use a site called Pixabay,

195
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,540
which is a source of copyright free 
images submitted by users,

196
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:01,030
so the images are all free and it's 
actually pretty good.

197
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:01,893
I think a lot of professional 
photographers upload some of their 

198
00:11:04,391 --> 00:11:08,530
photos to picks a bay just to get some 
exposure or just for fun or whatever.

199
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:09,543
I also buy some stock images as well as 
using some public domain images or 

200
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:14,110
noncommercial images.

201
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,153
I put all of these images into folders 
on my computer so that I can find them 

202
00:11:18,191 --> 00:11:20,560
in the next step during the editing 
process.

203
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:23,170
That brings me to the next step,
which is editing.

204
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:27,250
Now this is another very time consuming 
parts of making a lang focus video.

205
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:30,220
The editing software I use is called 
Sony Vegas,

206
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,840
which is all right.
It's pretty good.

207
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:35,740
There might be some better software out 
there like adobe premier or something,

208
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:36,603
but I just stick to what I know.
Sony Vegas is familiar to me so I just 

209
00:11:39,821 --> 00:11:40,654
keep using it.
The first thing I do when editing is I 

210
00:11:42,641 --> 00:11:43,474
take the video and audio files from the 
filming process and I lined them up on 

211
00:11:46,901 --> 00:11:47,734
the timeline so that the audio from my 
mic lines up with the audio from the 

212
00:11:50,831 --> 00:11:51,664
camera and then I turn off the cameras 
so that all you hear is the audio from 

213
00:11:55,271 --> 00:11:56,104
the level ear mic.
So right now let me play you something 

214
00:11:57,821 --> 00:11:59,800
using just the audio from the mic.

215
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:01,863
Hello everyone.
Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and 

216
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:04,624
my name is Paul,
but if I turn on the audio from the 

217
00:12:07,331 --> 00:12:08,740
camera,
it sounds like this.

218
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:09,783
Hello everyone.
Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and 

219
00:12:11,681 --> 00:12:12,514
my name is Paul,
so you get a much cleaner sound if you 

220
00:12:15,191 --> 00:12:17,020
remove the cameras,
echoey audio.

221
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:18,623
After that,
what I do is go through all the footage 

222
00:12:20,101 --> 00:12:20,934
and I cut it.
I removed all of the pauses and that 

223
00:12:22,671 --> 00:12:23,504
remove anything that I've repeated,
like sometimes I repeat the same 

224
00:12:26,281 --> 00:12:27,114
sentence several times just to get the 
delivery right and when I'm editing all 

225
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:31,584
listen to all of the versions and 
they'll take away all the ones I don't 

226
00:12:33,631 --> 00:12:34,464
want and just keep the best one so it 
usually takes a couple hours just to go 

227
00:12:37,231 --> 00:12:38,064
through the footage and cut it down.
A typical 10 minute video probably 

228
00:12:41,011 --> 00:12:41,844
begins with about 45 minutes to an hour 
of footage and then I cut it down to 

229
00:12:45,361 --> 00:12:46,200
about 10 minutes.

230
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:47,363
Next I removed the green screen 
background using the Chroma key 

231
00:12:49,801 --> 00:12:52,320
function.
I'm basically removing everything that's

232
00:12:52,321 --> 00:12:53,154
bright green so that it becomes 
transparent and that means that I can't 

233
00:12:56,181 --> 00:12:58,970
wear a green shirt because I'll become 
transparent,

234
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:00,043
but you can see that my green screen 
doesn't actually cover the entire space 

235
00:13:02,751 --> 00:13:04,790
behind me because of the layout of the 
room.

236
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:08,330
There's just not a lot of space to put 
the green screen rack in there.

237
00:13:08,331 --> 00:13:09,164
So the positioning is kind of awkward.
So I have to create a mask and cut out 

238
00:13:12,801 --> 00:13:14,850
everything that's outside of the green 
screen.

239
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:19,110
Okay.
So now that there's nothing behind me,

240
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,060
we're ready to place an image behind me

241
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,130
there.
Look guys,

242
00:13:25,131 --> 00:13:27,980
I'm in a classroom,
as you've probably noticed.

243
00:13:27,981 --> 00:13:28,814
I use a lot of visual elements in my 
videos and the large amount of 

244
00:13:31,671 --> 00:13:36,380
information that I try to cram into one 
video means that I have to include a lot

245
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:39,320
of visual detail and arrange it so that 
it's all clear.

246
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:42,530
While editing,
I make a lot of infographics now.

247
00:13:42,531 --> 00:13:43,364
This can be a very time consuming 
process because of how detailed 

248
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:46,933
languages and linguistics can be and 
what looks like one infographic to you 

249
00:13:50,451 --> 00:13:51,284
is actually a lot of different files so 
that I can animate the graphic and make 

250
00:13:54,471 --> 00:13:56,900
different elements gradually appear on 
the screen.

251
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:01,780
I make these infographics screens using 
a couple of different tools.

252
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:04,960
One of them is picmonkey and the other 
is paint.net.

253
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,063
Depending on exactly what functions I 
need to use at the moment while I'm 

254
00:14:08,861 --> 00:14:11,680
editing the video,
I take the images that I've gathered and

255
00:14:11,681 --> 00:14:12,514
the screens I've created and I import 
them into the Sony Vegas Media Library 

256
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:18,820
so that I can arrange them and layer 
them on the timeline.

257
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:23,900
I also add any audio that I need to the 
timeline.

258
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:24,853
Sometimes I have to rerecord some parts 
of the audio because the sound was 

259
00:14:27,861 --> 00:14:31,400
muffled or because I said one word wrong
or something like that,

260
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:32,503
and I also sometimes use audio from 
volunteers like language samples from 

261
00:14:36,021 --> 00:14:36,854
volunteers.
When I find volunteers to record some 

262
00:14:38,751 --> 00:14:39,584
language samples for a video,
I usually do that during the editing 

263
00:14:41,871 --> 00:14:44,390
process.
If you follow Lang focus on facebook,

264
00:14:44,391 --> 00:14:47,540
you've probably seen me post a request 
for volunteers.

265
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:50,000
For example,
I'm making a video on Greek.

266
00:14:50,001 --> 00:14:52,850
I need a volunteer speak Greek or 
something like that.

267
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:55,010
Uh,
and I get a lot of responses.

268
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,580
Then I choose one or two people and they
record their samples for me.

269
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:01,700
I can't choose everyone,
but I'm grateful for all of the offers.

270
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,300
So after I have those audio clips from 
the volunteer,

271
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:06,163
then I add those onto the timeline and 
that's usually one of the last steps of 

272
00:15:09,351 --> 00:15:10,490
the editing process.

273
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,070
So you see I'm wearing these glasses 
right here.

274
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:15,890
These glasses are actually blue 
blockers.

275
00:15:15,891 --> 00:15:20,150
They help block out the blue light from 
my computer screen and from the lights I

276
00:15:20,151 --> 00:15:20,984
use while filming and all of that blue 
light I guess ignites your brain and 

277
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,930
keeps you up at night.
It makes it harder to sleep because your

278
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:27,823
mind is activated.
So by wearing these like just block out 

279
00:15:30,921 --> 00:15:34,520
that light and rest a little bit more 
easily when I go to sleep.

280
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:38,690
So these are quite helpful.
I wear these every day after editing.

281
00:15:38,691 --> 00:15:43,190
The next step is to choose music usually
after editing sometimes earlier,

282
00:15:43,191 --> 00:15:47,150
but typically after editing I get music 
from a few different sources.

283
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:50,450
One of the main ones is the youtube 
audio library,

284
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,313
which is a source of copyright free 
music that Youtube creators can use for 

285
00:15:54,831 --> 00:15:55,664
free.
And some of us end up using the same 

286
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:58,880
songs,
the same tracks.

287
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,850
So sometimes in the comments I get 
comments like,

288
00:16:01,851 --> 00:16:03,620
Hey,
you stole that song from h three,

289
00:16:03,621 --> 00:16:04,700
h three,
or hey,

290
00:16:04,701 --> 00:16:07,940
that's the dubs content cop song or 
something like that.

291
00:16:07,941 --> 00:16:11,180
But in reality we all got those songs 
from the same source,

292
00:16:11,181 --> 00:16:12,014
from the Youtube Audio Library and there
are other sources of copyright free 

293
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:16,303
music as well.
Some of them are youtube channels that 

294
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:21,080
offer copyright free music.
Some of them are websites,

295
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,333
but it can be a little hard to find 
something suitable so you might notice 

296
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:28,490
the same music in several different 
videos on my channel.

297
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,410
That's because when I find something 
good,

298
00:16:30,411 --> 00:16:33,170
it's hard not to use it again.
After adding music.

299
00:16:33,171 --> 00:16:34,004
The next step is audio mastering,
so I go through all the footage through 

300
00:16:36,861 --> 00:16:40,190
the whole video,
listening to each individual audio clip,

301
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,230
making sure that everything is 
consistent,

302
00:16:42,231 --> 00:16:43,064
that the volume is about the same and 
that the quality of sound is about the 

303
00:16:46,161 --> 00:16:47,870
same for all the different clips.

304
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,153
This includes adding audio compression 
and also eat q to bring out the right 

305
00:16:52,491 --> 00:16:56,360
frequencies and if there are audio 
samples from a volunteer,

306
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,373
they often have a different sound to 
them and they can get lost in the mix 

307
00:16:59,841 --> 00:17:00,674
quite easily,
so I try to eat q them so that they are 

308
00:17:02,451 --> 00:17:05,240
clear on standout.
The final step is rendering.

309
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:08,750
Rendering means you're creating the 
final video file,

310
00:17:08,751 --> 00:17:09,584
so basically the editing software,
Sony Vegas takes all of the individual 

311
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:13,664
clips from the timeline and puts them 
all together and create one file out of 

312
00:17:17,301 --> 00:17:18,134
them.
This can take a long time depending on 

313
00:17:19,881 --> 00:17:20,714
your computer and depending on how long 
the video is and depending on how many 

314
00:17:24,111 --> 00:17:27,110
different files are on your timeline.
With my current computer,

315
00:17:27,111 --> 00:17:29,900
it typically takes around an hour to 
render a video,

316
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:30,943
but on my old computer at sometimes 
three or four hours while the video is 

317
00:17:34,281 --> 00:17:35,114
rendering,
I put together a thumbnail using 

318
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:37,514
picmonkey.

319
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:38,383
There's usually an image of myself in 
the thumbnail and that's not because I 

320
00:17:41,691 --> 00:17:42,524
want attention or because the video is 
supposed to be about me or something 

321
00:17:45,651 --> 00:17:47,180
like that.
It's really not.

322
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,253
I just do this as a way of my channel 
because when people who like Lang focus 

323
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,333
see me in the thumbnail,
they know that I have a new video and 

324
00:17:55,351 --> 00:17:58,860
they click on it immediately.
I try to make the thumbnail,

325
00:17:58,861 --> 00:17:59,694
catch people's eye using a background 
image behind me and using some texts 

326
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,793
that stands out and I also run the 
thumbnail through a filter sometimes 

327
00:18:07,381 --> 00:18:10,500
like through a photo filter,
the way people do on instagram.

328
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:13,560
I don't notice a lot of other youtube 
creators doing this,

329
00:18:13,561 --> 00:18:15,290
but I find it gives us sort of,
um,

330
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:17,880
interesting,
unreal effect to the thumbnails.

331
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:21,330
So once the video is finished,
rendering of the thumbnail is ready,

332
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,720
then I upload them to youtube on my old 
Internet connection.

333
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:25,703
This used to take hours and hours.
Sometimes it took six hours to upload a 

334
00:18:28,531 --> 00:18:29,364
video,
but currently I have vdsl internet and 

335
00:18:31,951 --> 00:18:35,070
it only takes like five or 10 minutes,
which is heaven.

336
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:38,310
After adding a title tags and 
description to the video,

337
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:39,203
then it's time to publish it and share 
it to social media so that all you 

338
00:18:42,331 --> 00:18:46,800
wonderful people know about the video.
This is actually quite important because

339
00:18:46,801 --> 00:18:50,460
youtube judges the importance of a video
based on view velocity,

340
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,473
the number of views that the video gets 
in a shorter amount of time right after 

341
00:18:54,571 --> 00:18:55,404
it's released,
so if I upload a video and a lot of you 

342
00:18:58,111 --> 00:18:58,944
immediately watch it.
If a thousand of you watch it in the 

343
00:19:00,811 --> 00:19:02,640
first two minutes,
then youtube says,

344
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:04,440
hey,
this must be an important video,

345
00:19:04,441 --> 00:19:07,020
and they share it with other people that
promote it more,

346
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:08,123
but on the other hand,
if only a couple of you watch the video 

347
00:19:10,561 --> 00:19:12,360
in the first couple of minutes,
Youtube says,

348
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:14,550
oh,
his fans don't care about this video.

349
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,470
It must suck.
Let's not promote it.

350
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:17,873
This happened with my video on Japanese.
The original thumbnail of the video 

351
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,000
wasn't the typical Lang focus thumbnail 
style.

352
00:19:24,001 --> 00:19:24,834
I didn't appear in the thumbnail and it,
it just looked different so people 

353
00:19:27,511 --> 00:19:28,344
didn't realize it was my video at first 
and the number of people who clicked on 

354
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,880
the thumbnail in the first couple of 
minutes was lower than usual and youtube

355
00:19:35,881 --> 00:19:38,580
set up.
This video isn't worth promoting.

356
00:19:38,581 --> 00:19:42,390
So the video really struggled to get as 
many views as it should have,

357
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:43,463
so that means when you guys rushed to 
watch one of my videos and you write 

358
00:19:45,901 --> 00:19:48,720
first in the comments and that's 
actually a good thing.

359
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:52,350
So that's the basic approach I take to 
making a lang focus video.

360
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:53,243
My experience making the video is 
probably quite different from your 

361
00:19:55,921 --> 00:19:56,754
experience watching the video.
It's really a lot of hard work and I 

362
00:20:00,061 --> 00:20:03,270
regularly clock 100 hours making a 
single video.

363
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,940
Uh,
I'm trying to cut that down actually.

364
00:20:05,941 --> 00:20:06,774
I'm trying to do more concise,
shorter videos on narrower topics 

365
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,430
basically for my own sanity and to make 
a,

366
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,920
to make everything more sustainable over
a long period of time.

367
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,143
But I do intend to keep making videos 
that I hope you find interesting and 

368
00:20:22,141 --> 00:20:25,830
educational and motivating,
which is really the goal of losing focus

369
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:26,723
and has been since the start.
So shall we do a question of the day as 

370
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,420
usual?
Sure.

371
00:20:30,421 --> 00:20:31,254
Why not?
Was there anything about the video 

372
00:20:32,911 --> 00:20:35,670
making process that stood out to you or 
surprised you?

373
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:38,940
Let us know in the comments down below.
If you don't follow Lang,

374
00:20:38,941 --> 00:20:40,350
focus on facebook,
twitter,

375
00:20:40,351 --> 00:20:43,170
or instagram,
please do at least one of those,

376
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:46,530
and I'd like to say thank you again to 
my patrion supporters,

377
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:47,423
especially these people right here on 
the screen who are my highest tier of 

378
00:20:50,831 --> 00:20:51,910
Patrion supporters.

379
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:55,090
Thank you very much to them and to all 
my patrion supporters.

380
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:58,630
This video is actually a patrion 
milestone video.

381
00:20:58,631 --> 00:21:02,590
I made this video to celebrate reaching 
a certain goal on Patrion,

382
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:06,280
so thanks to all of my supporters who've
helped me reach that goal.

383
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:08,320
If you'd like to become a patron as 
well,

384
00:21:08,321 --> 00:21:13,090
if you'd like to support me on Patrion,
then please visit patrion.com/lang

385
00:21:13,091 --> 00:21:15,160
focus.
But that's completely optional.

386
00:21:15,161 --> 00:21:15,994
It's up to you.
I'll never hold it against you if you 

387
00:21:18,461 --> 00:21:20,110
don't,
so don't even stress about it.

388
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:21,640
Alright.
Thank you for watching.

389
00:21:21,641 --> 00:21:23,980
I hope you found this type of video 
interesting.

390
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,190
Thank you for watching and have a nice 
day.
