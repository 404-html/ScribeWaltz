00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,930
Welcome to the channel and my name is 
Paul.

2
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:11,823
Today I'm going to talk about the 
Swahili language or Kiswahili as it's 

3
00:00:15,581 --> 00:00:17,350
called in Swahili,
and by the way,

4
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:21,460
Keith is a prefix that means language.
Swahili is one of the most widely spoken

5
00:00:21,461 --> 00:00:22,294
languages in Africa,
and if we only consider languages that 

6
00:00:24,281 --> 00:00:27,070
are native to Africa,
then it is the most widely spoken.

7
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:30,370
It is widely spoken over a wide area of 
east Africa.

8
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,490
The number of native speakers of Swahili
is actually rather small,

9
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,353
somewhere between five and 15 million,
but it is widely spoken as a Lingua 

10
00:00:37,751 --> 00:00:40,780
Franca that unites the linguistically 
diverse population.

11
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:41,823
Estimates vary,
but the total number of proficient 

12
00:00:43,301 --> 00:00:44,134
speakers,
if we include second language and third 

13
00:00:45,611 --> 00:00:49,120
language speakers,
could be as high as $150 million or even

14
00:00:49,121 --> 00:00:51,520
more Swahili,
is an official language in Kenya,

15
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:55,060
Tanzania,
Uganda and Democratic Republic of Congo,

16
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:57,850
and it's spoken in other countries like 
Rwanda and Burundi.

17
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,250
The closely related Korean language 
spoken in Comoros.

18
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,760
There's also sometimes considered a 
dialect of Swahili.

19
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:06,400
Chances are that you know a little bit 
of Swahili already,

20
00:01:06,401 --> 00:01:07,234
whether you know it or not.
If you've seen the Disney movie lion 

21
00:01:09,251 --> 00:01:10,870
king,
then you know the name Simba.

22
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:14,590
Simba means lion in Swahili,
and maybe you remember Nala,

23
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:17,730
Nala means gift in Swahili.
Then there's roughly d,

24
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:21,610
Rafiki means friend in Swahili,
and of course there's Puma.

25
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:25,450
Puma means stupid in Swahili,
and of course there's Hakuna Matata.

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,150
Tata means no worries in Swahili,

27
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:30,240
Simba,
Nala,

28
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:32,430
Rafiki,
Aquanaut,

29
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,433
my dad,

30
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:35,343
Swahili is one of the two languages 
that's a traditional branch of the 

31
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:39,663
Nigeria Congo language family,
throw around $250 into languages 

32
00:01:42,011 --> 00:01:44,950
depending on what we consider our 
language versus a dialect.

33
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:48,790
The history of Swahili is somewhat 
unclear,

34
00:01:48,791 --> 00:01:49,624
but it originally developed as a 
language of coastal areas of Kenya and 

35
00:01:52,301 --> 00:01:53,134
Tanzania.
Fishermen spread the language to nearby 

36
00:01:55,061 --> 00:01:57,220
islands.
Then over the following centuries,

37
00:01:57,221 --> 00:02:00,730
traders from these islands spread the 
language to a larger area of the coast.

38
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:01,623
Today,
this coastal region stretching from 

39
00:02:02,651 --> 00:02:03,484
southern Somalia all the way down to 
northern Mozambique is where most of 

40
00:02:06,011 --> 00:02:07,660
Swahili native speakers are.
Found.

41
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:11,740
The areas where Swahili is spoken had a 
lot of interaction with foreign traders,

42
00:02:11,741 --> 00:02:14,800
particularly those from the Middle East,
throughout the Middle Ages.

43
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:17,730
One of the main commodities the traders 
were seeking was close,

44
00:02:17,731 --> 00:02:20,170
so person in Arab traders established 
cloves,

45
00:02:20,171 --> 00:02:21,004
farms in Zanzibar archipelago,
and they also established trading 

46
00:02:23,531 --> 00:02:24,364
settlements along the mainland coast 
with both foreign traders and local 

47
00:02:27,311 --> 00:02:30,730
African Swahili speaking trader,
settling along the new trade route,

48
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,890
Swahili absorbed many foreign loan 
words,

49
00:02:32,891 --> 00:02:34,300
especially from Arabic.

50
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,990
In fact,
the name of the language itself while he

51
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:38,350
lead,
comes from Arabic.

52
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:41,800
The Arabic word for Kostas side and the 
plural form is so,

53
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:45,630
uh,
so with the prefix key key Swahili means

54
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,130
the language of the coasts.
In large part,

55
00:02:48,131 --> 00:02:48,964
this interaction between foreign Muslim 
traders and local Africans is what made 

56
00:02:52,181 --> 00:02:53,014
the Swahili language what it is today,
a Bantu language with a large number of 

57
00:02:56,651 --> 00:02:59,110
loan words from other languages,
especially Arabic,

58
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,003
but also Persian,
Malaya and other languages to contact 

59
00:03:02,681 --> 00:03:05,710
with European colonial powers also 
influenced Swahili.

60
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:09,160
Portugal began establishing colonies in 
East Africa and 15,

61
00:03:09,161 --> 00:03:10,110
oh,
five ce,

62
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:13,570
including in Zanzibar and along the 
Kenyan intensity and coasts.

63
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,453
And as you might predict,
this led to the adoption of some 

64
00:03:17,081 --> 00:03:21,790
Portuguese vocabulary,
but by about 1730 ce Omani,

65
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:22,624
Arabs have retaken that region from the 
Portuguese and reestablished control 

66
00:03:25,511 --> 00:03:26,344
over it.
Around that time in the early 18th 

67
00:03:27,701 --> 00:03:30,340
century,
Swahili spread further inland with Arab,

68
00:03:30,341 --> 00:03:32,290
ivory and slave trade caravans.

69
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:33,243
This brought Swahili to more inland 
areas of Kenya and Tanzania to the 

70
00:03:35,951 --> 00:03:37,990
eastern part of Congo,
northern Uganda,

71
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:41,140
and Rwanda and Burundi in the mid 18th 
century.

72
00:03:41,141 --> 00:03:43,960
The British and the Germans began 
colonizing the area.

73
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:48,250
Germany took Tanganyika or modern day 
Tanzania as a colony in 18,

74
00:03:48,251 --> 00:03:49,084
86.
And the British took control of Kenya 

75
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,520
then called the East Africa protectorate
in 1895.

76
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:55,623
And they both encouraged the use of 
Swahili as a national language to unite 

77
00:03:58,301 --> 00:04:00,820
the population which spoke dozens of 
different languages.

78
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:04,140
Germany made Swahili,
the official end administrative language

79
00:04:04,141 --> 00:04:06,460
and Tanganyika.
While the British made English.

80
00:04:06,461 --> 00:04:09,040
The official language at the highest 
levels in Kenya.

81
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,820
English was the language for National 
Administration and for higher education,

82
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:13,743
but Swahili was made the language for 
local administration and for primary 

83
00:04:16,931 --> 00:04:19,630
education in order to help spread the 
Swahili language.

84
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:22,090
It needed to be standardized,
so in 1928,

85
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,953
a conference was called for this purpose
and the dialect of Zanzibar was chosen 

86
00:04:26,051 --> 00:04:26,884
as the basis for the standard language,
its status as an official language or 

87
00:04:29,951 --> 00:04:30,784
national language as well as the 
language of education has made Swahili 

88
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:37,960
widely spoken as a second language or 
third language in Kenya and Tanzania and

89
00:04:37,961 --> 00:04:40,450
in the eastern part of the Democratic 
Republic of Congo.

90
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,433
In Tanzania.
Around 80 percent of the people can 

91
00:04:42,821 --> 00:04:43,654
speak it and amongst the younger 
generations it is becoming more widely 

92
00:04:46,121 --> 00:04:46,954
spoken as a native language,
especially in the urban areas and the 

93
00:04:49,391 --> 00:04:50,920
situation is similar.
In Kenya,

94
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,023
in the Democratic Republic of Congo,
it's most widely spoken in the eastern 

95
00:04:54,851 --> 00:04:55,684
part of the country,
but in total around 50 percent of the 

96
00:04:57,521 --> 00:04:59,410
population are proficient in the 
language.

97
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,310
It is also fairly widely spoken in 
Rwanda and Burundi and to some extent in

98
00:05:03,311 --> 00:05:06,070
Uganda as well.
But even though Swahili has been made an

99
00:05:06,071 --> 00:05:09,640
official language in Uganda and it is 
compulsory to learn in schools.

100
00:05:09,641 --> 00:05:10,474
A lot of people are not interested in 
learning it and a lot of schools have 

101
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:15,070
actually been teaching it.
At least that's what I hear.

102
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:18,160
So what is Swahili like orthography?
Well,

103
00:05:18,161 --> 00:05:20,020
it used to be written in the Arabic 
script,

104
00:05:20,021 --> 00:05:22,150
but because of European colonial 
influence,

105
00:05:22,151 --> 00:05:22,984
it is now written in the Latin script 
and it's written phonetically so that 

106
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,210
each letter represents just one sound in
the language.

107
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:29,463
Phonology,
Swahili has five vowel sounds which are 

108
00:05:31,511 --> 00:05:35,200
always fully pronounced and not reduced.
There are no diphthongs.

109
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:36,034
That means that there are no combination
of vowels pronounced as a single 

110
00:05:38,381 --> 00:05:42,970
syllable like I or owl,
or if you see two vowels side by side,

111
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,010
they have to be pronounced as separate 
syllables.

112
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,830
This makes the phonology generally quite
easy to learn,

113
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,920
and all Swahili consonants have English 
equivalents,

114
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,053
but there are some things to be careful 
of to nasal consonants can come before 

115
00:05:55,391 --> 00:05:58,280
other consonants with no vowel in,
for example,

116
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,473
means child boy means dog means banana.
Learning how to pronounce these sounds 

117
00:06:06,891 --> 00:06:08,660
together,
maybe a challenge at first.

118
00:06:08,661 --> 00:06:11,210
If you've never spoken the language with
that feature before.

119
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:15,020
Grammar articles,
there are no articles in Swahili,

120
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,650
there is no equivalent to awkward that 
in the language nouns.

121
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,113
Swahili has a system of now in classes 
now in classes or categories of 

122
00:06:23,391 --> 00:06:26,870
different types of nouns that are 
represented by specific prefixes,

123
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,290
in most cases,
one singular and plural for each type of

124
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:32,710
note.
First the walk.

125
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:36,680
Last nouns in this class represents 
people or animate beings,

126
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:41,180
words with the prefix or singular and 
those with the wall prefix or plural.

127
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:44,910
For example,
baby babies,

128
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:49,250
insect insects.

129
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:52,423
Another class is the class.
Nouns in this class represent trees or 

130
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:56,624
plants.
Words with them or move prefix are 

131
00:06:58,611 --> 00:06:59,444
singular.
While those with the prefix are plural 

132
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:06,010
tree,
two trees need another.

133
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:06,853
Glass is the glass.
This class includes a wide variety of 

134
00:07:09,981 --> 00:07:11,420
nouns,
including some animals,

135
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:13,460
loan words and miscellaneous other 
words.

136
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:16,700
This is the biggest of the mountain 
glasses because of all the loan words in

137
00:07:16,701 --> 00:07:18,140
Swahili,
and for this class,

138
00:07:18,141 --> 00:07:23,141
the prefix denotes both singular and 
plural bird birds,

139
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:28,430
but this class it gets quite complicated
and sometimes the prefix changes.

140
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:33,090
It changes to an sounds like an m before
a b or a v wine.

141
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:38,180
And being new wines,
new and other words in this class,

142
00:07:38,181 --> 00:07:39,014
lose their prefix altogether.
So it's interesting to note that an 

143
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:42,170
English,
the plural form,

144
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:44,960
is indicated by the s suffix at the end 
of the word,

145
00:07:44,961 --> 00:07:45,794
but in Swahili,
it's indicated by a prefix at the 

146
00:07:47,511 --> 00:07:48,380
beginning of the word.

147
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:49,423
Now,
in the classes are known to be one of 

148
00:07:50,121 --> 00:07:52,580
the biggest challenges facing learners 
of Swahili.

149
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:53,803
Adjectives now in class prefixes are 
also applied to adjectives that modify 

150
00:07:57,801 --> 00:07:58,634
those nouns.
So the word for good that base form is 

151
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:01,573
Zuni,
but we add a prefix means a good person 

152
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,063
who act was judy means good people.
So the prefix changes not only on the 

153
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:16,220
now but also on the adjective adverbs.
Adverbs can be formed from the base form

154
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:20,620
of the adjective by adding the prefix.
V Good Zuni.

155
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:25,900
Well,
they got bad badly back.

156
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:28,600
Here's an example,
sentence it Soma.

157
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:34,280
He read badly.
Adverbs can also be formed from nouns by

158
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:37,460
adding the word clock before the theory 
means.

159
00:08:37,461 --> 00:08:40,070
Secret.
Quite theory mean secretly.

160
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:41,503
Verbs aside from now in the classes.
The other main thing about Swahili that 

161
00:08:44,931 --> 00:08:47,750
requires some adjustment from learners 
is the verbal system.

162
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:48,703
In Swahili,
a basic verb consists of a subject 

163
00:08:50,721 --> 00:08:52,280
prefix,
a tense marker,

164
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,780
and object in fix.

165
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:57,210
If the object is a separate word and the
verb stem.

166
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:00,040
Here are some examples,
a taboo.

167
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:03,330
This means he gave me the book is the 
subject,

168
00:09:03,331 --> 00:09:04,164
pronouns,
meaning he is the tense marker 

169
00:09:05,971 --> 00:09:09,390
indicating past tense Ne is the object 
marker for me,

170
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:12,980
and pop is the verb.
Stem meaning give and get taboo.

171
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,730
It means book,
and that's a lone word.

172
00:09:14,731 --> 00:09:15,564
From Arabic.
We can change the tense of the sentence 

173
00:09:17,221 --> 00:09:20,000
by changing the tense marker I can eat 
that could dabble,

174
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,130
so this means he will give me the book 
in the future tense.

175
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:27,390
So we changed the past tense marker to 
talk the future tense marker.

176
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:30,550
Now let's change the subject of the 
sentence or could dabble.

177
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,213
That means you will give me the book.
So we changed the subject prefix from 

178
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:38,610
which means he to uber,
which means you.

179
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,450
One interesting thing is that there are 
negative subject prefixes.

180
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,170
That means we can make the sentence 
negative by using a different subject.

181
00:09:46,171 --> 00:09:48,120
Pronouns.
Here's an example hat.

182
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:51,480
Any becky tab that means he will not 
give me the book,

183
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:54,270
so remember,
the positive form was taboo.

184
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,193
That meant he will give me the book,
but we changed the AAP to hop and that 

185
00:09:58,651 --> 00:10:01,320
is the negative equivalent of the 
subject prefix.

186
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,190
So every subject prefix has a negative 
equivalent and you have to remember both

187
00:10:05,191 --> 00:10:07,680
and you have to think about which one to
use when you're speaking.

188
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:12,830
The basic syntax of Swahili is Svo when 
there is no object in fix Tambo.

189
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,713
When they're cooler,
this means elephants eat grass in the 

190
00:10:16,981 --> 00:10:20,250
sentence.
Ten Bolt means elephant y equals they.

191
00:10:20,251 --> 00:10:23,550
That's the subject prefix,
not equals present tense marker.

192
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:24,623
Kula equals eat and use equals grasp.
So you can see that when we use a 

193
00:10:28,261 --> 00:10:32,250
specific known as the subject,
we still use the subject prefix attached

194
00:10:32,251 --> 00:10:33,060
to the verb.

195
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:33,893
Another example mean that that cooler,
this means I love eating meat is the 

196
00:10:37,771 --> 00:10:38,604
subject.
Margaret meaning I not is the present 

197
00:10:40,231 --> 00:10:41,064
tense marker.
Pen De Equals love and cooler equals 

198
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,280
eating.
And of course,

199
00:10:44,281 --> 00:10:47,760
that's s v O is Swahili,
easy to learn.

200
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,713
Well,
the pronunciation is known for being 

201
00:10:49,741 --> 00:10:52,530
very straightforward and the grammar is 
very logical,

202
00:10:52,531 --> 00:10:55,800
but it's also very different unless 
you've studied a Bantu language before,

203
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:56,813
but now in class system and the verbal 
system with all of its affixes require 

204
00:10:59,591 --> 00:11:02,520
some extra attention to learn.
And for English speakers,

205
00:11:02,521 --> 00:11:05,970
the lack of immediately recognizable 
vocabulary might be a challenge,

206
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:09,720
but if you happen to speak Arabic,
then you will immediately recognize lots

207
00:11:09,721 --> 00:11:11,070
of Swahili.
Vocabulary.

208
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:14,970
Here are some examples at daddy comes 
from Arabic hot daughter,

209
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,570
which means danger.
Chat comes from Arabic Sephardic,

210
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:21,930
which means travel,
comes from Arabic Mahal,

211
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:25,590
which means place.
Taboo comes from the Arabic Kitab,

212
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:29,100
which means book Buddy ed comes from the
Arabic boded,

213
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:31,770
which means cold and that's just a small
sample.

214
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:33,990
There are lots of Arabic words in 
Swahili,

215
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:34,973
although the pronunciation has adapted 
to fit into the Swahili phonological 

216
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:38,693
system.
Swahili is a unique product of the 

217
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:42,834
history of the east African coast and 
the interaction of the local Bantu 

218
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:48,810
people with foreign traders from the 
Middle East and elsewhere.

219
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:49,943
It is becoming more widely spoken and 
continues to grow as a Lingua Franca in 

220
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,793
east Africa.
If you're planning on living or 

221
00:11:55,091 --> 00:11:55,924
traveling in the region or if you just 
want to learn about Africa and some of 

222
00:11:58,361 --> 00:12:01,450
its cultures than Swahili would be a 
great language to learn.

223
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:04,390
So the question of the day,
for people who have studied Swahili,

224
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:07,930
what did you find challenging about it,
and what did you find straightforward or

225
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,050
simple about it and for proficient 
speakers of Swahili,

226
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:13,420
how widely spoken is Swahili in your 
area?

227
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,433
Is it mostly spoken as a second or third
language or are there lots of native 

228
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:18,010
speakers as well?

229
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,380
Let us know in the comments down below.

237
00:12:40,751 --> 00:12:42,460
month,
that's all very helpful.

So thank you for watching and have a 
nice day.
