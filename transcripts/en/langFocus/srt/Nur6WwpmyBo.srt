1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,290
So where are you from?
Oh,

2
00:00:01,291 --> 00:00:06,000
Brazil has funded Hablo Espanol out.
Hello everyone.

3
00:00:06,001 --> 00:00:08,640
Welcome to the Lange focus channel.
My name is Paul.

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,400
Today I'm going to talk about 
Portuguese.

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,030
Portuguese is a language that far too 
often gets ignored in Canada.

6
00:00:15,031 --> 00:00:17,280
If you tell someone you want to study 
Portuguese,

7
00:00:17,281 --> 00:00:18,091
they might say,
oh,

8
00:00:18,091 --> 00:00:20,910
isn't that kind of like Spanish or worse
yet?

9
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,560
They might say,
why Portuguese?

10
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:23,423
Why don't you study Spanish instead?
And I'm sure Portuguese speakers just 

11
00:00:26,431 --> 00:00:27,264
love that.
The truth is that Portuguese is one of 

12
00:00:28,981 --> 00:00:33,981
the world's major languages with between
215 and $220 million people.

13
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,250
It is the second most widely spoken 
romance language after Spanish,

14
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,040
like Spanish.
It is so widely spoken because it spread

15
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:44,070
to the four corners of the globe during 
the colonial period.

16
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:46,650
It is the only official language in 
Portugal,

17
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:48,180
Brazil,
Mozambique,

18
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:49,460
Angola,
Cape Verde,

19
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:50,580
Guinea,
Bissau,

20
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,191
Saulteaux,
may,

21
00:00:51,191 --> 00:00:54,150
and principate and it's co official in 
East Timor,

22
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,390
Ecuadorian Guinea and Macau,
like all romance languages.

23
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,223
Portuguese developed from Vulgar Latin,
which was the spoken Latin used during 

24
00:01:01,411 --> 00:01:05,210
the Roman Empire together with Castilian
Spanish along with Galician.

25
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,053
And a few other languages,
it forms the Iberico Romance Branch of 

26
00:01:09,151 --> 00:01:09,984
the Romance Language family.
It's called [inaudible] romance because 

27
00:01:12,361 --> 00:01:13,194
it's located on the Iberian peninsula 
when the Romans conquered the Iberian 

28
00:01:16,531 --> 00:01:17,550
peninsula,
vulgar,

29
00:01:17,551 --> 00:01:19,260
lax,
and began to be spoken there,

30
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,000
and it started to diverge gradually over
time into different regional dialects.

31
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,420
And by the 10th century,
those dialects had diverged enough to be

32
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:31,410
considered separate languages,
but Portuguese didn't exactly exist yet,

33
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:35,190
and Alisha and Portuguese also known as 
Old Portuguese existed.

34
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,850
Galician Portuguese diverged into two 
separate modern languages,

35
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,880
Galician and Portuguese by about the 
16th century,

36
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:44,250
although they're still quite similar 
from what I hear.

37
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:50,920
The language received its name,
Portuguese in the year 1290,

38
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:51,803
when the king of Portugal opened the 
first university in Portugal and he 

39
00:01:54,901 --> 00:01:57,720
decided that the language of instruction
would not be Latin,

40
00:01:57,721 --> 00:02:00,120
but would be the vulgar Latin,
the spoken language,

41
00:02:00,121 --> 00:02:02,730
and he decided to call that language 
Portuguese.

42
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:05,490
Portugal was still a relatively new 
kingdom at that time,

43
00:02:05,491 --> 00:02:07,740
and the language had never been called 
Portuguese yet.

44
00:02:07,741 --> 00:02:08,574
It was just called vulgar Latin and it 
was not yet very distinct from the 

45
00:02:11,251 --> 00:02:12,084
vulgar Latin spoken in Galicia in the 15
hundreds when the newly developed 

46
00:02:15,841 --> 00:02:19,050
printing press helped make Portuguese a 
standardized language.

47
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,003
Portugal had already started exploring 
and colonizing different areas of the 

48
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:24,840
world,
bringing their language with them.

49
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:26,003
The net result is this,
Portuguese is spoken by around 10 

50
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:32,160
million people in Portugal,
but it is much more dispersed around the

51
00:02:32,161 --> 00:02:32,994
world.
It is spoken by $205 million people in 

52
00:02:35,461 --> 00:02:38,340
Brazil and then of course there's Africa
in Angola.

53
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,800
It is the native language of about 5 
million people,

54
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:41,663
20 percent of the population,
but it's also widely used as a lingua 

55
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:47,100
franca that unites the countries,
different ethnic groups.

56
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,190
That is about 15 million more second 
language speakers,

57
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,810
Cape Verdi,
500,000

58
00:02:51,811 --> 00:02:54,840
people speak a Portuguese based creole 
as their native language,

59
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:58,350
but they learn Portuguese as a second 
language for official purposes.

60
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:02,260
Also in Guinea Bissau the most common 
language is a Portuguese creole,

61
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:05,800
but Portuguese is also an official 
language with around 200,000

62
00:03:05,801 --> 00:03:07,300
native speakers.
In Mozambique.

63
00:03:07,301 --> 00:03:08,134
There are one point $9 million native 
speakers and another 10 million who 

64
00:03:10,631 --> 00:03:13,550
speak it as a second language in south 
Romania and prints EPA.

65
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:14,403
It is spoken by another 120,000
people as a native language in 

66
00:03:17,561 --> 00:03:18,394
Equatorial Guinea.
It was made an official language in 

67
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:22,360
recent years though nobody really speaks
it.

68
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:26,170
I think they did that to promote their 
relations with other Portuguese speaking

69
00:03:26,171 --> 00:03:29,080
countries in the area and let's not 
forget Asia,

70
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:31,810
Portuguese as a co official language in 
East Timor,

71
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,780
which was a Portuguese colony until 
1975.

72
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:37,390
Nowadays it is a co official language 
again,

73
00:03:37,391 --> 00:03:38,224
but mostly only older people can speak 
it and they are almost all second 

74
00:03:41,141 --> 00:03:41,974
language speakers also in Macau.
Portuguese is spoken by zero point six 

75
00:03:45,371 --> 00:03:46,204
percent of the population as a native 
language and it's also spoken by some 

76
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:52,630
elderly people as a second language,
but not so much these days.

77
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:57,540
There are also the former Portuguese 
colonies in India specifically go up and

78
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:58,423
do you.
Portuguese is spoken by some people 

79
00:04:00,101 --> 00:04:00,934
there,
but the numbers are quite small these 

80
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:03,003
days.
There were also a Portuguese creole 

81
00:04:03,851 --> 00:04:05,950
spoken in Malacca,
Malaysia Florists.

82
00:04:05,951 --> 00:04:07,390
Indonesia,
Batticaloa,

83
00:04:07,391 --> 00:04:08,224
Sri Lanka and Aruba,
if we include the second language 

84
00:04:10,421 --> 00:04:15,421
speakers than there are about 250 to 260
million speakers of Portuguese.

85
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,920
That does not include the creole 
languages.

86
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:19,323
Portuguese is the sixth most widely 
spoken language in the world and it is 

87
00:04:22,751 --> 00:04:23,584
also the most widely spoken language in 
South America even though it's only 

88
00:04:26,351 --> 00:04:27,850
spoken in one country there.

89
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,610
Brazil,
there are different accents and dialects

90
00:04:30,611 --> 00:04:31,444
of Portuguese,
but the main through categories are 

91
00:04:32,921 --> 00:04:33,754
European,
Portuguese which is spoken in Portugal 

92
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:38,590
and Brazilian Portuguese which is spoken
in Brazil.

93
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,583
Brazilian Portuguese is similar to 18th 
century Portuguese and also has some 

94
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:46,870
influences from the Indian languages and
African languages of the people who were

95
00:04:46,871 --> 00:04:47,704
present in Brazil.
I've read a lot of comments by lots of 

96
00:04:50,171 --> 00:04:53,170
different people about this,
but it seems like the difference between

97
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,033
Brazilian and European.
Portuguese is basically like the 

98
00:04:55,991 --> 00:04:59,020
difference between UK English versus 
American English.

99
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:01,690
There is different accents,
different pronunciation.

100
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,620
There are some different vocabulary 
words and idioms and some of the grammar

101
00:05:05,621 --> 00:05:08,410
is slightly different,
but basically they are the same language

102
00:05:08,411 --> 00:05:10,300
and are intelligible.
They'll sometimes,

103
00:05:10,301 --> 00:05:13,300
depending on your exposure to the other 
variety of the language,

104
00:05:13,301 --> 00:05:16,810
you might have some trouble 
understanding or communicating which one

105
00:05:16,811 --> 00:05:17,644
is better to study.

106
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:18,543
Well,
most students have Portuguese seemed to 

107
00:05:19,781 --> 00:05:23,380
say that Brazilian Portuguese is easier 
to learn and on top of that,

108
00:05:23,381 --> 00:05:24,214
Brazil has a huge population of over 200
million people and you're much more 

109
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:29,350
likely to meet Brazilians around the 
world.

110
00:05:29,351 --> 00:05:32,680
Then you are Portuguese people in my 
experience on top of that,

111
00:05:32,681 --> 00:05:36,550
Brazilian soap operas are very popular 
around the world and they make people in

112
00:05:36,551 --> 00:05:37,384
all Portuguese speaking countries,
quite familiar with Brazilian 

113
00:05:39,581 --> 00:05:41,470
Portuguese,
so in my opinion,

114
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:42,603
the best one to learn as Brazilian 
Portuguese unless you have a specific 

115
00:05:45,191 --> 00:05:48,670
plan to visit or live in Portugal and 
there might be some other reasons.

116
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,504
I've preferred Brazilian Portuguese,
but there's no need to get into that 

117
00:05:52,211 --> 00:05:53,044
right now.
Did you know the Iberian peninsula was 

118
00:05:54,911 --> 00:05:55,744
under Islamic rule for several hundred 
years and during that time Portugal 

119
00:05:58,551 --> 00:05:59,384
absorbed some influence from the Arabic 
language and that includes about 800 

120
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:05,000
vocabulary words of Arabic origin.

121
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,860
Something similar happened to Spanish 
too.

122
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:07,813
There are also some Portuguese words 
that have made their way into the 

123
00:06:09,771 --> 00:06:11,840
English vocabulary.
For example,

124
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,400
breeze,
cashew,

125
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:16,130
Cobra,
embarrass flamingo,

126
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,920
some food like Marmalade,
molasses,

127
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:23,240
tapioca and the insect mosquito.
Like most romance languages,

128
00:06:23,241 --> 00:06:24,074
Portuguese has a lot of vocabulary that 
is recognizable to English speakers 

129
00:06:26,901 --> 00:06:29,570
because of the French and Latin 
influence on English.

130
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,300
Let's look at a Portuguese sentence and 
I'll show you what I mean.

131
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:34,670
Okay.
Forgive my pronunciation here guys.

132
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:35,803
Taylor swift that you mock on.
Dora instrument prototype forum was Eco 

133
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,150
North America now,
so let's look at some of the words here.

134
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:46,160
A controller,
what that looks like.

135
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,053
The English word camp tour,
which is someone who recites music in a 

136
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:51,680
synagogue or church.
I think so.

137
00:06:51,681 --> 00:06:54,860
I think that Cantata is a singer.
He told her,

138
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,750
well,
that looks like a composer.

139
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:59,780
So I think that means musical composer,
instrument Tiesta.

140
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:00,643
Well,
I think that looks like instrumentalist 

141
00:07:02,091 --> 00:07:05,600
or musician and prototype that looks 
like a producer.

142
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:10,460
So prototype was eco,
must've been musical producer and then a

143
00:07:10,461 --> 00:07:15,230
three step must be an actress and not 
the medical center that looks like North

144
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:17,420
American.
So if you look at all of those words and

145
00:07:17,421 --> 00:07:18,254
just kind of analyze each word,
you can figure out the meaning of that 

146
00:07:20,361 --> 00:07:21,194
sentence pretty easily.
A lot of Portuguese sentences are like 

147
00:07:23,451 --> 00:07:25,550
that though.
They're not always that simple,

148
00:07:25,551 --> 00:07:26,384
but I gave you a simple example just to 
show you that you can often recognize 

149
00:07:29,601 --> 00:07:30,434
words like that so you can probably 
learn to read some Portuguese fairly 

150
00:07:33,201 --> 00:07:34,034
easily.
If you an English speaker and if you 

151
00:07:35,361 --> 00:07:38,750
know another romance language,
then you can probably already read a lot

152
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,670
of it without having studied the 
language.

153
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,713
Of course,
learning to speak it and to write it 

154
00:07:42,951 --> 00:07:43,784
will require focus and effort because 
that means you have to actually produce 

155
00:07:46,581 --> 00:07:50,240
the phonology and produced the grammar 
as you have to with any language.

156
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:54,230
So stop thinking of Portuguese as the 
strange little brother of Spanish.

157
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:57,860
It's actually an important global 
language that stands on its own.

158
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:00,230
Thank you for watching the [inaudible]
