Hello everyone.
Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and 

4
00:00:08,891 --> 00:00:12,190
my name is Paul.
Today's topic is a language that some of

5
00:00:12,191 --> 00:00:13,024
you have probably never heard of,
but it's a fascinating topic and one 

6
00:00:15,491 --> 00:00:19,570
that's definitely worth a look.
The topic is catch you up and then catch

7
00:00:19,571 --> 00:00:21,880
you up.
The language is sometimes referred to as

8
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:24,760
Luna see me,
which means the people's language.

9
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:27,090
If we include all varieties of catch you
up.

10
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:27,963
It is by far the most widely spoken 
native language in South America with 

11
00:00:31,151 --> 00:00:34,480
between eight and 10 million speakers 
spread out across Peru,

12
00:00:34,481 --> 00:00:35,314
Bolivia and Ecuador,
as well as northern Argentina and 

13
00:00:37,751 --> 00:00:41,020
southern Columbia.
Spanish is now the dominant language and

14
00:00:41,021 --> 00:00:41,854
all of those countries,
but of course that wasn't always the 

15
00:00:43,631 --> 00:00:45,940
case.
Even if you haven't heard of Catchoua,

16
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:46,803
you've most definitely heard of the Inca
civilization whose capital was located 

17
00:00:50,201 --> 00:00:51,034
at Cusco in present day Peru and who's 
empire was the largest in the Americas 

18
00:00:54,761 --> 00:00:55,594
in the pre colonial period,
and as their empire expanded the 

19
00:00:58,151 --> 00:00:58,984
language spread to new areas because it 
became the general language or the 

20
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,410
Lingua Franca of the areas under the 
empire's control,

21
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:06,303
the origin of catch,
what is debated with some people saying 

22
00:01:08,351 --> 00:01:09,184
that it originated in the Cusco area and
others saying that it originated in the 

23
00:01:12,371 --> 00:01:14,260
central coastal area of Peru.

24
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:17,950
Throughout the time of Inca rule.
Catch well was not a written language.

25
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:22,420
Records were only kept in kibbutz.
A system of nodded strings that serve as

26
00:01:22,421 --> 00:01:23,254
symbols or mnemonic reminders of 
information keepers are not fully 

27
00:01:26,591 --> 00:01:27,424
understood,
but they are not thought to represent 

28
00:01:29,141 --> 00:01:31,240
the sound or the structure of catch you 
up.

29
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:32,283
Instead,
they simply provide reminders of 

30
00:01:33,611 --> 00:01:34,444
information to be passed down,
orally catch what did not become a 

31
00:01:37,271 --> 00:01:40,570
written language until the Spanish 
conquest of the Inca empire,

32
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:41,493
which took place between 1532 and 15 
slash 70 to catch what continued to be 

33
00:01:45,581 --> 00:01:46,414
spoken as a Lingua Franca.
After the Spanish conquest and the 

34
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:49,984
Catholic church used to catch why in its
efforts to convert people spreading the 

35
00:01:53,081 --> 00:01:53,914
language even further.
The oldest written record of catch you 

36
00:01:56,031 --> 00:01:56,864
up is a book written in 15,
60 by the missionary Domingo de Santo 

37
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,473
Tomas called Grammar or art of the 
general language of the Indians of the 

38
00:02:04,451 --> 00:02:05,680
royalty of Peru.

39
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,173
After the Tupac Amaru rebellion of 1780,
the colonial power band catch you up 

40
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:12,064
from public use even catch what texts 
that were pro colonial or pro Catholic 

41
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:16,624
were banned and the language began to 
decline after the Spanish American wars 

42
00:02:19,961 --> 00:02:21,520
of independence from Eighteen,
oh,

43
00:02:21,521 --> 00:02:25,150
eight to 18,
33 gets you ahead a brief revival,

44
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:28,210
but it has gradually lost prestige and 
declined in use.

45
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:32,170
One of the main reasons for the decline 
of catch you up is the use of Spanish as

46
00:02:32,171 --> 00:02:36,040
the language of education and of the 
media and the use of Spanish as the main

47
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:36,874
language of national economies and with 
economic development comes increased 

48
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,313
urbanization.
When people move from their local area 

49
00:02:43,241 --> 00:02:46,390
to a major city,
it's necessary to speak Spanish with the

50
00:02:46,391 --> 00:02:48,660
majority of people who don't speak catch
you up.

51
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:49,743
Spanish is often thought of as the 
language of prestige and of economic 

52
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:53,464
opportunity,
so speakers of catch you up or people 

53
00:02:55,121 --> 00:02:55,954
whose parents speak catch you up often 
see it as something low prestige and to 

54
00:02:59,441 --> 00:03:02,710
avoid some ketchup speaking parents,
avoid speaking,

55
00:03:02,711 --> 00:03:06,040
catch you up with their children at home
and instead speak to them in Spanish.

56
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:10,010
Even in researching this video and then 
looking for volunteers to read the catch

57
00:03:10,011 --> 00:03:12,790
with samples,
some people told me that they themselves

58
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:13,750
don't speak,
catch you up,

59
00:03:13,751 --> 00:03:17,520
but that their friend's parents speak 
Quechua or that their uncle or aunt's be

60
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:19,293
Peru was the first country to make catch
you on official language in 1975 along 

61
00:03:23,261 --> 00:03:26,620
with Imr and other native languages in 
Bolivia.

62
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:27,483
It's been an official language along 
with 35 other native languages since 

63
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:31,294
2006 in Bolivia.
Each regional government is officially 

64
00:03:34,451 --> 00:03:35,284
bilingual,
choosing both Spanish and one of the 

65
00:03:37,121 --> 00:03:41,920
other official languages in Ecuador.
Catch has had semi official status since

66
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:44,950
2009.
Spanish is the main official language,

67
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:45,813
but catch one shoe are referred to as 
official languages for intercultural 

68
00:03:49,421 --> 00:03:54,070
relations even though catch what began 
to be written after the Spanish conquest

69
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:54,923
is still mainly a spoken language and it
isn't really written all that much and 

70
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:00,790
there are various different standards of
orthography.

71
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,360
This is partly because catch was spoken 
differently in different places.

72
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:09,300
Catch what is not really a single 
language.

73
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,830
Rather it is a series of closely related
groups of dialects and those groups have

74
00:04:13,831 --> 00:04:16,740
dialects that have a high level of 
mutual intelligibility,

75
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:17,603
can be considered languages.
If there were one standard written 

76
00:04:20,341 --> 00:04:24,000
language that was widely accepted and 
widely used throughout all the different

77
00:04:24,001 --> 00:04:24,834
areas,
then it might be able to be called a 

78
00:04:25,981 --> 00:04:28,530
single language because of that unifying
force,

79
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,393
but there is no such standard language 
catch what is divided into two major 

80
00:04:32,761 --> 00:04:33,594
dialect categories.
Catch will one and catch what to which 

81
00:04:36,331 --> 00:04:37,164
are fairly distinct from each other,
but there's a dialect continuum within 

82
00:04:40,111 --> 00:04:42,030
each category.
Catch well.

83
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:46,350
One is spoken in central Peru and to 
sometimes referred to as whitewash.

84
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,353
Catch what too,
which is sometimes called [inaudible] 

85
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:52,530
can be further subdivided into three 
dialect groups.

86
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:53,693
There's [inaudible] in northern Peru.
Catch what to be northern catch well 

87
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,433
also known as kitchen which has spoken 
mainly in Ecuador and southern Columbia 

88
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,860
and catch what to see southern catch you
up,

89
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,753
which includes the catch was spoken 
around Cusco in Bolivia and in 

90
00:05:08,581 --> 00:05:09,330
Argentina.

91
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:10,163
Southern catch well is the most commonly
spoken and the Cusco dialect is often 

92
00:05:13,561 --> 00:05:16,230
seen as the de facto standard variety of
catch.

93
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,820
Well,
even though it really isn't,

94
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:18,803
the dialects within each of these groups
are largely intelligible and there is 

95
00:05:21,811 --> 00:05:24,690
some degree of intelligibility between 
the different groups.

96
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:25,913
The lowest degree of intelligibility is 
between casual one and catch what to 

97
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,620
even if both varieties are located in 
Peru.

98
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,633
The difference between a one and catch.
What [inaudible] seems to have resulted 

99
00:05:35,281 --> 00:05:36,114
from a split from catch will the main 
differences between them or in 

100
00:05:39,091 --> 00:05:39,924
vocabulary and morphology.
There are differences in pronunciation 

101
00:05:42,781 --> 00:05:43,614
to,
but there are also pronunciation 

102
00:05:44,731 --> 00:05:48,380
differences within each group.
So what is catch like?

103
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:51,920
Let's look at some of the features of 
catch you up focusing on southern catch.

104
00:05:51,921 --> 00:05:52,754
Well,
syntax catch while isn't Sov language 

105
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,580
subject,
object,

106
00:05:56,581 --> 00:05:57,414
verb.
Let's take a look at an example 

107
00:05:59,091 --> 00:05:59,924
sentence.

108
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,880
This means Maria builds a house word for
word.

109
00:06:04,881 --> 00:06:08,620
It's Maria House object marker,
build,

110
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,493
third person singular.
You can see that the basic order is 

111
00:06:11,391 --> 00:06:12,560
subject,
object,

112
00:06:12,561 --> 00:06:13,394
verb.
The subject comes at the beginning of 

113
00:06:14,781 --> 00:06:16,880
the sentence when there's an explicit 
subject,

114
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:17,893
but it's possible to have a complete 
sentence without the subject at the 

115
00:06:20,211 --> 00:06:21,500
beginning,
like lassie,

116
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,373
todd,
who won the end suffix at the end is a 

117
00:06:24,171 --> 00:06:25,004
subject suffix,
so it's often not necessary to have a 

118
00:06:27,051 --> 00:06:29,800
subject at the beginning.
Agglutination,

119
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:33,600
one of catch was main features is that 
it's highly a gluten itself.

120
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:36,770
Let's look at an example of a gluten 
nation using a noun.
