1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:05,930
According to my research,
there are 26 countries in Latin America.

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:10,040
So the most widely spoken language in 
the world is obviously Latin.

3
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,073
Right.

4
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:23,483
Good evening everyone.
Today I'm going to talk about what are 

5
00:00:26,251 --> 00:00:29,400
the most commonly spoken languages in 
the world.

6
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:30,293
A lot of people want to know that.
What are the most commonly spoken or 

7
00:00:33,271 --> 00:00:36,600
most widely spoken languages on earth?
Well,

8
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:37,463
it depends on how you measure it.
It depends on whether you measure only 

9
00:00:40,111 --> 00:00:42,540
native speakers or if you measure the 
uh,

10
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:44,790
the number of second language,
third language speakers,

11
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:45,970
all that.
Uh,

12
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:46,853
so let's just talk about a couple of 
different ways to count the number of 

13
00:00:49,711 --> 00:00:50,544
speakers.
So the first way is just by native 

14
00:00:51,901 --> 00:00:53,550
speakers.
If we do that,

15
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:58,610
then mandarin is the most widely spoken 
language in the world with 1.1

16
00:00:59,191 --> 00:01:02,100
billion speakers,
that's billion with a b.

17
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:03,173
And that's only Mandarin.
That doesn't include all of the other 

18
00:01:05,341 --> 00:01:08,590
Chinese languages in China.
Uh,

19
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:09,563
if you include those,
that would be another couple hundred 

20
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,160
million.
But just native speakers of Mandarin 1.1

21
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,173
billion.

22
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,080
You mentioned that billion after that.
Number two is English,

23
00:01:19,081 --> 00:01:19,914
which is far,
far behind with 330 million native 

24
00:01:23,281 --> 00:01:24,740
speakers.
Uh,

25
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:27,870
as you might expect,
it's in the top couple,

26
00:01:27,871 --> 00:01:28,704
but it's only number two after,
after Mandarin Chinese number three is 

27
00:01:31,921 --> 00:01:36,390
Spanish with 300 million people.
So what's not far behind English?

28
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,910
Judging by the number of native 
speakers,

29
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:42,060
it's not far behind English,
but we'll get to that again later.

30
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:45,730
And number four is Hindi slash or do,
uh,

31
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:49,530
that's widely considered to be the same 
language.

32
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,393
It's Hindi in India,
but it's Urdu in Pakistan or when 

33
00:01:53,851 --> 00:01:55,120
spoken,
um,

34
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:55,860
in,
uh,

35
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,680
by Muslims.
And you've written in the Arabic script,

36
00:01:59,070 --> 00:01:59,903
but it's usually considered the same 
language because the core is the same 

37
00:02:02,671 --> 00:02:05,970
and they are mutually intelligible.
So same language,

38
00:02:05,971 --> 00:02:06,804
basically.
Number five is Arabic with 200 million 

39
00:02:09,571 --> 00:02:10,404
people.
A Bengali with 185 million people is 

40
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:15,840
number six.
Bengali is up,

41
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:16,703
the language spoken in Bangladesh and 
that area of the eastern part of Indian 

42
00:02:21,031 --> 00:02:26,010
sub continent and number seven is 
Portuguese with 160 million people.

43
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,680
Number eight is Russian with 160 
million.

44
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:31,240
About the same as Portuguese and 
Japanese.

45
00:02:31,241 --> 00:02:34,110
122 million,
puts it at number nine,

46
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:37,050
and then German is number 10 with a 100 
million.

47
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,860
Then we have Punjabi Javanese that's 
spoken in Indonesia,

48
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,050
and then French is number 13.
Umm,

49
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,233
so let's compare that to the number of 
speakers including second language 

50
00:02:50,761 --> 00:02:51,594
speakers,
but proficient second language speakers 

51
00:02:53,401 --> 00:02:56,220
proficient meaning that they can speak 
it fairly well.

52
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,233
Uh,
even though it's not their native 

53
00:02:58,081 --> 00:02:58,914
language.
So number one is still mandarin Chinese 

54
00:03:01,601 --> 00:03:03,640
with 1.3
5 billion.

55
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:04,563
So basically the speakers of all the 
other Chinese languages also learn 

56
00:03:07,361 --> 00:03:09,880
mandarin as the national language of 
China.

57
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:15,750
That's why there's an extra 200 or two,
250 million speakers of Mandarin Chinese

58
00:03:17,741 --> 00:03:19,810
when we include the second language 
speakers.

59
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,870
Now English is surprising one,
well not surprising,

60
00:03:22,871 --> 00:03:26,920
but impressive with that.
It's still at number two with 1.2

61
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:30,130
billion speakers,
including the second language speakers.

62
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:34,000
So that's quite a difference between the
number of native speakers.

63
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:37,930
330000001.2
billion.

64
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:39,183
So that's something like 870 million 
people have learned English as a second 

65
00:03:44,321 --> 00:03:47,980
language and speak it proficiently.
That's quite impressive.

66
00:03:47,981 --> 00:03:50,410
That's a large percentage of the world's
population.

67
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:53,050
Uh,
when we get to number three,

68
00:03:53,051 --> 00:03:54,700
there's a change.
It's not Spanish,

69
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:58,810
it's Hindi and Urdu because in India and
in Pakistan,

70
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:02,080
those languages are not the native 
language of everybody.

71
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:02,943
But a lot of people who speak a 
different language learn Hindi and Urdu 

72
00:04:06,071 --> 00:04:08,140
as a second language.
Uh,

73
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,003
so they can communicate with speakers of
other languages in the Indian 

74
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:12,784
subcontinent.
So that has a 750 million proficient 

75
00:04:16,001 --> 00:04:18,550
speakers if we're including second 
language speakers.

76
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:21,340
So that displaced Spanish from number 
three,

77
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:22,413
but no Spanish is still at number four 
with 530 million speakers including 

78
00:04:26,261 --> 00:04:27,094
second language speakers than Arabic.
Still at number five with 300 and 

79
00:04:30,461 --> 00:04:33,400
million,
319 million speakers.

80
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:34,503
And that's because a lot of people in 
Africa learn Arabic as a second 

81
00:04:37,961 --> 00:04:39,940
language.
Uh,

82
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:44,970
number six is French with 274 million.
So French is another one that jumped way

83
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:47,800
up the list when we included second 
language speakers.

84
00:04:47,801 --> 00:04:48,634
That's because there are a lot of 
countries in the world where French is 

85
00:04:51,431 --> 00:04:55,240
not the native language,
but it's the official language or it's a

86
00:04:55,241 --> 00:04:59,590
language that is spoken by a large,
a large proportion of the population,

87
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,453
so that includes much of Africa.
A French is widely spoken in Africa and 

88
00:05:04,361 --> 00:05:08,200
a lot of different countries,
so that's why it goes up from 75 million

89
00:05:08,201 --> 00:05:09,034
to 274 million.
It's almost 200 million people speak 

90
00:05:12,761 --> 00:05:15,250
French proficiently as a second 
language,

91
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:19,750
so that's quite impressive to number 
seven we get a language that wasn't even

92
00:05:19,751 --> 00:05:24,610
on the list for when we calculate it,
just native speakers and that is molay.

93
00:05:24,611 --> 00:05:25,870
Slash.
Indonesian.

94
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:26,973
That's another one of those languages 
that has two different names because 

95
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:30,693
people in different cultural groups or 
different countries call it something 

96
00:05:33,521 --> 00:05:34,210
different.

97
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:39,210
So Malaya Malaya has Malaysian language 
in Malaysia and it's Indonesian language

98
00:05:39,371 --> 00:05:41,230
in Indonesia,
but same language,

99
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,513
almost entirely the same.
Just some different vocabulary and 

100
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:45,723
different accent and that kind of thing.
That one goes up to 270 million if we 

101
00:05:49,991 --> 00:05:54,660
include second language speakers.
And that's because in Indonesia it's,

102
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,410
it's not the native language of very 
many people.

103
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:01,580
I think it's five to 10% of the people 
who speak it as their native language.

104
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,960
But it is the national language and 
everybody learns it as the Lingua Franca

105
00:06:05,961 --> 00:06:10,100
and as a language of education that of 
business and everything.

106
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:14,060
So it doesn't have that many native 
speakers,

107
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:18,560
but it has a huge number of speak 
proficient speakers,

108
00:06:18,561 --> 00:06:23,510
including second language speakers.
So Indonesian and Malay with 270 million

109
00:06:23,511 --> 00:06:25,190
people.
And then after that,

110
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,860
um,
I didn't keep track of all of them.

111
00:06:27,861 --> 00:06:28,694
But it's interesting how the most 
important languages are not necessarily 

112
00:06:32,181 --> 00:06:36,770
the ones with the most native speakers 
because languages can be important based

113
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,420
on their status as a Lingua Franca.

114
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,340
So we see that with melee and 
Indonesian.

115
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,133
So just because a language has a lot of 
speakers doesn't necessarily mean that 

116
00:06:46,011 --> 00:06:50,000
it's the most important or most 
influential language on a global scale.

117
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,193
So another factor that we can think 
about introduced into the conversation 

118
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:55,843
is how many places that language is 
spoken in over how wide of a geographic 

119
00:06:59,601 --> 00:07:03,050
area is it spoken?
So if you think about Chinese,

120
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:07,430
it's spoken basically only in China.
If we're thinking of Mandarin,

121
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,430
it's spoken in China,
it's also spoken in Taiwan,

122
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,800
although they claimed Taiwan as part of 
China.

123
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:13,903
Um,
and it's also spoken in the Chinese 

124
00:07:15,411 --> 00:07:19,130
diaspora to a large extent,
but basically it's only in China,

125
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:21,200
just that one country.
It's a big country.

126
00:07:21,201 --> 00:07:23,960
It's an important country,
but it's only that one country.

127
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,770
So does that make Chinese the most 
important language?

128
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,540
Is Mandarin the most important language?

129
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:32,180
Just because it's spoken by the most 
people?

130
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:36,080
Well,
I would say no because on a global scale

131
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:39,350
it's not used that much by a non native 
speakers.

132
00:07:39,351 --> 00:07:42,830
And it's not used between people of 
different countries as a Lingua Franca,

133
00:07:42,831 --> 00:07:45,200
it's not used as an international 
language of business.

134
00:07:45,201 --> 00:07:49,670
So I would say it's not the number one 
most influential or important language.

135
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,930
Even though China has any emerging 
country and it's a powerful country,

136
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:54,764
an important country,
it's still not the most important 

137
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:57,950
language in the world.
I would say it.

138
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:59,383
English you could argue is the most 
important because it has such a huge 

139
00:08:02,781 --> 00:08:04,700
number of second language speakers but 
it's,

140
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:06,680
but they're dispersed all over the 
world.

141
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,260
So everywhere you can find people who 
speak English.

142
00:08:09,261 --> 00:08:11,900
So it's arguably the most important.
Um,

143
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:12,763
Spanish is also a very important one 
because Spanish is spoken in so many 

144
00:08:15,741 --> 00:08:17,030
countries,
uh,

145
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,070
and it has native speakers in so many 
countries.

146
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:21,180
So Spanish could be,
uh,

147
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,570
one of the top most influential 
languages,

148
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,660
Arabic as well as spoken in a lot of 
different countries.

149
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,793
Arabic is a tricky one though because it
has a huge number of dialects and the 

150
00:08:31,131 --> 00:08:31,964
dialects can vary quite a bit.
So whether you can communicate with 

151
00:08:36,051 --> 00:08:39,470
speakers in a different country or not,
if you learn Arabic,

152
00:08:39,471 --> 00:08:40,304
that's an entirely different issue in 
that complicates the matters with 

153
00:08:43,551 --> 00:08:44,384
Arabic.
So I would say Arabic is not one of the 

154
00:08:46,131 --> 00:08:47,840
most important though.
It's,

155
00:08:47,841 --> 00:08:48,674
it's up there.
It's quite important and quite useful 

156
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,103
around the world,
especially in Africa and the Middle 

157
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:54,043
East.
French is globally important because of 

158
00:08:56,881 --> 00:08:59,310
that,
because of all the places it's spoken.

159
00:08:59,311 --> 00:09:00,144
It's spoken in a lot of former colonies 
in Asia and the Caribbean and South 

160
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:05,450
America a little bit.
Um,

161
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,610
and especially in Africa and in many 
countries.

162
00:09:08,611 --> 00:09:09,720
In Europe,
French is spoken,

163
00:09:09,721 --> 00:09:10,554
so French is also one of the most 
important languages because of its 

164
00:09:13,441 --> 00:09:17,790
dispersion over a large area.
I would say English,

165
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,100
Spanish,
French,

166
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:21,563
maybe Arabic would be the most important
on a global scale if we're thinking 

167
00:09:25,411 --> 00:09:29,130
about the number of countries and the 
widest geographic area.

168
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:30,343
All right.
Those are just my thoughts on the 

169
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:33,000
matter.
Those are the most important,

170
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,520
most widely spoken languages in the 
world,

171
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,470
I guess.
What do you think?

172
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:41,700
Which ones are the most important?
Leave your comments below and let's have

173
00:09:41,701 --> 00:09:42,890
a chat about it.
All right.

174
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,490
Thank you very much.
Talk to you later.
