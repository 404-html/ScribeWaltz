[inaudible] Marsha say if I say like who

00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:10,200
comes to see?
Marsha said,

3
00:00:10,201 --> 00:00:11,880
if I say like you [inaudible]

4
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:18,363
good evening everyone.
Today I'm going to talk about how to 

5
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:21,663
improve your listening comprehension in 
the target language that you are 

6
00:00:25,751 --> 00:00:29,050
studying.
Now I should point out in advance,

7
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:32,500
I'm not talking to people who don't know
any of the language yet.

8
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:33,483
There's no point trying to improve your 
listening comprehension if you don't 

9
00:00:36,521 --> 00:00:39,730
know the phonology,
the basic grammar and sentence structure

10
00:00:39,731 --> 00:00:40,564
and basic vocabulary of the language.
Really I'm talking to people who are 

11
00:00:43,451 --> 00:00:46,720
already studying the language,
already know some of the basics,

12
00:00:46,721 --> 00:00:47,554
but their listening comprehension is not
up to speed with their other skills and 

13
00:00:52,151 --> 00:00:54,640
other awareness of the language.
All right,

14
00:00:54,641 --> 00:00:57,940
so the most important thing is to listen
to every day.

15
00:00:57,970 --> 00:00:58,803
Consistency is king.
You want to practice listening every 

16
00:01:01,051 --> 00:01:01,884
day.
Make sure you are practicing listening 

17
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:04,173
just as much as you are practicing 
reading or practicing speaking or 

18
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:10,300
learning grammar and vocabulary.

19
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:11,253
Spend just as much time on the listening
because obviously that's of key 

20
00:01:14,921 --> 00:01:17,530
importance when you want to communicate 
with people.

21
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:20,830
So these days it's very easy to do every
day.

22
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,050
Even if you live in the middle of 
nowhere.

23
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:23,913
If you have an internet connection,
you have no excuse to not practice the 

24
00:01:27,071 --> 00:01:27,904
listening.
When I studied Hebrew language back in 

25
00:01:30,881 --> 00:01:31,714
like 1997 in those days,
the Internet was just getting off the 

26
00:01:35,201 --> 00:01:37,120
ground.
There were very few resources.

27
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:40,030
You guys today are very lucky.
Make use of them.

28
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:43,420
You have a youtube videos,
all languages have,

29
00:01:43,421 --> 00:01:44,254
you have videos available on Youtube.
I'm sure you can find something good 

30
00:01:47,141 --> 00:01:48,150
there.
Uh,

31
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,490
as well,
you can find streaming radio stations,

32
00:01:51,491 --> 00:01:53,690
streaming news networks,
um,

33
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:54,723
streaming television stations.
You can find downloadable videos on 

34
00:01:58,091 --> 00:02:01,150
demand,
full movies and your target language.

35
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:04,180
You can find everything.
So make sure you get some of that.

36
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:06,340
No excuses.
Do it every day.

37
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:07,413
Okay.
One piece of advice I will give you is 

38
00:02:08,981 --> 00:02:13,090
to use videos and to use videos that 
have subtitles.

39
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:14,223
So if you get a DVD,
sometimes you can set the subtitles on 

40
00:02:17,411 --> 00:02:20,380
so you can watch with the subtitles and 
then maybe remove them.

41
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,573
Um,
but also on the internet you can find 

42
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,160
videos that have been,
um,

43
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:30,580
they've had subtitles added to them as a
way to help second language learners.

44
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:31,563
Like I found a website for French that 
had all sorts of movies with subtitles 

45
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:36,963
added to them,
French movies that somebody added the 

46
00:02:38,681 --> 00:02:41,770
subtitles as a way to help second 
language learners,

47
00:02:41,771 --> 00:02:42,604
French learners.
So there are materials out there like 

48
00:02:44,261 --> 00:02:48,820
that with subtitles and those are very 
useful for helping you make a connection

49
00:02:48,821 --> 00:02:53,260
between the visual and the auditory.
Some people are more visual learners,

50
00:02:53,261 --> 00:02:57,280
they need to understand the language 
visually and conceptualize it visually.

51
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:58,323
And if you're just listening,
sometimes won't be able to perceive the 

52
00:03:00,551 --> 00:03:03,520
sounds until you make that connection 
with the written word.

53
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:04,623
So the subtitles help you do that to 
make that connection between the sound 

54
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:11,680
and the visual.
And I recommend that you listen with the

55
00:03:11,681 --> 00:03:12,514
subtitles first,
but then you can remove them if it's a 

56
00:03:14,951 --> 00:03:18,520
DVD and you can remove the subtitles 
with the setting then do that.

57
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:19,623
But if the subtitles are kind of are,
they're already edited into the video 

58
00:03:23,261 --> 00:03:26,260
and you can't remove them,
then you can try it as closing your eyes

59
00:03:26,261 --> 00:03:28,450
or covering your eyes.
You can do that.

60
00:03:28,451 --> 00:03:29,284
I'm sure after you are already familiar 
with the content of the video and you 

61
00:03:32,381 --> 00:03:33,214
know what it's about,
you know the the topic and stuff from 

62
00:03:35,321 --> 00:03:38,770
reading it,
then you can switch off the subtitles.

63
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,633
Just tried to rely on your hearing the 
second time around and you are getting 

64
00:03:43,001 --> 00:03:43,834
rid of that visual crutch after you've 
already made the connection between 

65
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:49,000
auditory and visual.

66
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,103
Okay.
So watch once with subtitles once 

67
00:03:51,071 --> 00:03:53,740
without train yourself like that to just
listen,

68
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,083
I should say.
They'll be where of captions on Youtube 

69
00:03:57,761 --> 00:04:01,150
or any automatically generated captions.
They usually suck.

70
00:04:01,151 --> 00:04:03,970
Sometimes they're hilarious.
So if you want a good laugh,

71
00:04:03,971 --> 00:04:06,580
you can watch them and figure out what 
they're saying.

72
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:08,950
Usually it's way off.
So just be careful.

73
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,500
The captions are not usually accurate.
Okay.

74
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:16,090
I recommend that you practice listening 
to a variety of different levels.

75
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:21,220
So some materials out there are made for
second language learners.

76
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,083
So they are graded,
they use grated language that's aimed 

77
00:04:23,981 --> 00:04:24,820
at,
for example,

78
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:28,090
beginners or intermediate level or upper
intermediate,

79
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:29,163
the languages tailored for learners.
So it's simpler and it's easier for you 

80
00:04:32,951 --> 00:04:33,784
to grasp and understand.
So I recommend you use that sometimes 

81
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,583
because that helps you consolidate the 
things that you are learning in your 

82
00:04:41,441 --> 00:04:42,274
textbook,
the things that you are studying or the 

83
00:04:43,721 --> 00:04:45,490
things you learn in class from your 
teacher.

84
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,103
If you use a simple video,
simple audio too that will help you 

85
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:53,140
review and consolidate things you're 
already learning.

86
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,310
And it's encouraging because it's,
it's not too far above your level,

87
00:04:57,311 --> 00:04:58,144
not too far out of your comfort zone.
So you will be able to understand a lot 

88
00:05:01,871 --> 00:05:02,704
of it and that will be encouraging for 
you and you'll feel that you're 

89
00:05:04,211 --> 00:05:05,044
improving and you're using the language 
for something functional so you'll feel 

90
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,573
good and encouraged.
But at the same time I recommend that 

91
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:16,210
you use more difficult materials that 
are aimed at native speakers.

92
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:19,090
So listen to the radio,
listen to the news,

93
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:21,160
watch TV shows,
that kind of thing.

94
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:24,760
And just experience the sound of the 
language.

95
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,900
I recommend that you have no 
expectations of understanding.

96
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:29,763
You just relax.
You don't put any pressure on yourself 

97
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:36,400
to have good comprehension.
You just want to just hear the sounds of

98
00:05:36,401 --> 00:05:39,430
the language and notice the things that 
you recognize.

99
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,650
Even if you don't understand what's 
being said,

100
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:42,510
just think,
ah,

101
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,710
I remember that word,
I've heard that before.

102
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:45,843
And notice the patterns of intonation.
Notice where if you notice where one 

103
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:53,920
word starts and then ends or you notice 
where the next word begins,

104
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,230
that's that's all fine.
Just notice that.

105
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:57,423
Don't worry about trying to understand.
You just want to internalize those 

106
00:06:00,891 --> 00:06:01,724
patterns subconsciously.
So then once you are study gets to that 

107
00:06:06,231 --> 00:06:07,064
level,
you will be very well prepared to to 

108
00:06:09,201 --> 00:06:10,034
understand it because you've already 
internalized all of those auditory 

109
00:06:14,181 --> 00:06:15,080
patterns.
Okay,

110
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:18,800
so I recommend you listen to simpler 
materials.

111
00:06:18,801 --> 00:06:23,801
Also more challenging materials.
Just listen and experience the sounds.

112
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,213
That's it.
And the last thing I'll recommend is to 

113
00:06:27,501 --> 00:06:31,010
speak with native speakers.
Maybe it sounds obvious to some of you,

114
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:35,240
but a lot of people still just studying 
books and they still,

115
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:36,883
they still just learn to read and write 
and make sentences out loud in the 

116
00:06:39,891 --> 00:06:42,350
language without actually talking to 
native speakers.

117
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:44,240
But these days with the Internet,
again,

118
00:06:44,241 --> 00:06:45,074
you have no excuse.
You can go to [inaudible] dot com and 

119
00:06:48,351 --> 00:06:51,170
you can find a skype teacher.
Some of them are really cheap.

120
00:06:51,171 --> 00:06:52,730
Depending on the language you're 
speaking,

121
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:53,743
you can sometimes get a lesson for like 
$5 per hour or $10 per hour is more 

122
00:06:57,771 --> 00:06:58,740
common.
Um,

123
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:00,860
it's,
it's cheap and it's effective.

124
00:07:00,861 --> 00:07:04,640
You need to speak with native speakers 
in your target language,

125
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,930
especially in an uncontrolled context.
Like if it's just,

126
00:07:08,931 --> 00:07:13,070
I'm a very structured,
scripted lesson where they do listen and

127
00:07:13,071 --> 00:07:13,904
repeat with you are they,
have you just read sentences and that 

128
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:20,720
kind of thing that's not as beneficial.
You want to have some surprises.

129
00:07:20,721 --> 00:07:23,600
You want it to be uncontrolled so that 
you,

130
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:27,500
you hear things you weren't expecting 
and that kind of trains you to,

131
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:31,970
to not panic when you hear things that 
you don't understand,

132
00:07:31,971 --> 00:07:32,870
to just relax.

133
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:36,230
And notice the things that you do 
understand to use all of the cues,

134
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:40,670
all of the signals that help you 
understand including intonation,

135
00:07:40,671 --> 00:07:42,200
including,
um,

136
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,570
including context,
including body language,

137
00:07:44,571 --> 00:07:45,404
all that stuff.
You just want to train yourself to 

138
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:48,913
notice the things that help you 
understand and ignore the stuff that 

139
00:07:50,991 --> 00:07:53,030
doesn't.
That's why it's good to,

140
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:57,890
to practice in an uncontrolled the 
context with native speakers so that you

141
00:07:57,891 --> 00:08:00,830
are doing that with the native sounds of
the language.

142
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,710
All right,
so those are my pieces of advice for how

143
00:08:03,711 --> 00:08:06,980
to improve listening comprehension.
It's not rocket science.

144
00:08:06,981 --> 00:08:07,814
You just need to do it every day.
There are tons of resources on the 

145
00:08:10,551 --> 00:08:12,290
Internet.
You can use radio,

146
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:14,390
you can use videos,
you can watch youtube,

147
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:15,403
all that stuff.
Get a teacher through I talky or some 

148
00:08:17,241 --> 00:08:21,350
service like that.
Speak with people and use subtitles when

149
00:08:21,351 --> 00:08:22,880
you watch videos.
