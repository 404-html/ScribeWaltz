3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,400
Hello everyone.
Welcome to the Lange focus channel.

4
00:00:07,401 --> 00:00:08,420
Uh,
my name is Paul.

5
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:12,530
Today's video is the third installment 
in the mystery languages series.

6
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,840
Maybe you've seen mystery languages one 
and two.

7
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:16,880
If not,
you can find them right here.

8
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:20,240
But here's how it works.
I'll play you a sample of a language and

9
00:00:20,241 --> 00:00:21,074
then I'll show you a written sample of 
the language and you can make an 

10
00:00:23,031 --> 00:00:25,400
educated guess as to what that language 
is.

11
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:28,580
And don't worry if you can't get the 
exact language correctly.

12
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:29,443
The important thing is that you tell us 
your guesses and your reason for your 

13
00:00:31,521 --> 00:00:34,760
guesses in the comments down below.
And that will start a lot of interesting

14
00:00:34,761 --> 00:00:35,594
discussions.
So let's get right into the first 

15
00:00:36,771 --> 00:00:37,970
language.
Please listen.

16
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:40,123
Yo,
Miss [inaudible] [inaudible] 

17
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:51,110
[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] it's
an example is [inaudible]. [inaudible]

18
00:00:52,891 --> 00:00:53,724
was purse.

19
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:56,260
Now let's see some written samples of 
that language.

20
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:57,453
Kwong Costa show.
This means how much is this Anisa 

21
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:01,363
lovable.
This means where's the toilet bodily Mr 

22
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:07,360
pocket boxes plow.
This means speak more slowly,

23
00:01:07,361 --> 00:01:08,194
please.
[inaudible] this means could you write 

24
00:01:11,731 --> 00:01:14,080
it please?
So what language is it?

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,833
The language is Catalan,
a romance language spoken mostly in 

26
00:01:21,241 --> 00:01:24,480
eastern Spain as well as in Andorra and 
in part of France.

27
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,780
If you guessed Spanish or Portuguese or 
another romance language,

28
00:01:27,781 --> 00:01:29,640
then you're not too far off.
In fact,

29
00:01:29,641 --> 00:01:33,210
Katelyn has 85% lexical similarity with 
Spanish,

30
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,790
but the two are only partly mutually 
intelligible.

31
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:39,600
Catalan is part of the Occidental 
Romance sub family along with oxytocin.

32
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:40,733
It's always interesting to take a look 
at a romance language that you're not 

33
00:01:42,721 --> 00:01:43,554
too familiar with because you might see 
some features of one romance language 

34
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:48,540
and some different features from another
romance language.

35
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,860
If we look at the sentence again for 
three area,

36
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,850
looks like the Spanish word for could 
this word [inaudible].

37
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:58,020
It seems kind of like a clear in French 
[inaudible] in Italian,

38
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,210
which mean to write.
And this phrase,

39
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:03,270
see you plow seems like silver plate in 
front,

40
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,433
so you can see why some people say that 
learning to romance languages helps you 

41
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:09,590
understand a fair bit of the others,
at least in writing.

42
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,420
Okay.
Onto the next language.

43
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,480
Please listen.
Yeah,

44
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:17,890
yeah,
yeah,

45
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:23,380
yeah.
Okay.

46
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:26,430
Okay.
Okay.

47
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,023
And again,
let's have a look at some written 

48
00:02:29,841 --> 00:02:33,240
samples in Gemini.
This means,

49
00:02:33,241 --> 00:02:37,980
how are you when said to a male 
[inaudible] work in decibels,

50
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:41,030
this means pleased to meet you.
Sim,

51
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:43,110
my no,
this means,

52
00:02:43,111 --> 00:02:46,860
what is your name when said to a male 
Aerosol Kaya to note,

53
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,650
and this means,
where are you from?

54
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:50,060
So what language is it?

55
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:55,350
The languages?
I'm Horic,

56
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,500
I'm horic is a language spoken in 
Ethiopia by around 22 million people.

57
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:01,780
It's a member of the Semitic language 
family,

58
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,940
meaning that it's related to Arabic and 
Hebrew,

59
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,340
but it's not intelligible with those 
languages.

60
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,410
I've studied Hebrew and Arabic in the 
past,

61
00:03:08,411 --> 00:03:10,330
but I can't understand.
I'm Arik at all.

62
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:11,403
But there are a couple of cognates I can
see in these written samples like the 

63
00:03:13,811 --> 00:03:14,644
word for name Sim in Arabic,
the word is Islam and in Hebrew it's 

64
00:03:18,401 --> 00:03:19,234
Shim here and I'm horic summer is your 
name with the suffix being a possessive 

65
00:03:24,611 --> 00:03:25,444
pronoun.
In Arabic you'd say is muck and in 

66
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,760
Hebrew you'd say a Shim Heart.
Also mum is the word for what?

67
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,420
Which might be related to the Arabic 
word math and the Hebrew word mark.

68
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:36,430
Okay.
Onto the next language,

69
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,353
please listen.

70
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:38,483
Kiva Gosiger very challenging.
[inaudible] the unit mini van 

71
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,020
[inaudible]

72
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,023
and again,
let's see some written samples of this 

73
00:03:56,201 --> 00:04:01,201
language.
This means pleased to meet you.

74
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:05,230
I'm going to [inaudible] this means 
where are you from?

75
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,770
[inaudible]

76
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,620
this means long time.
No,

77
00:04:09,621 --> 00:04:13,580
see [inaudible].
This means have a good journey.

78
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:18,530
So what languages it,
it's the Tamil language.

79
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:22,520
Tamil is the language spoken in southern
India as well as in Sri Lanka as well as

80
00:04:22,521 --> 00:04:25,400
by Tamil communities overseas and places
like Malaysia.

81
00:04:25,401 --> 00:04:26,234
And Singapore is a dravidian language,
which is unrelated to the Indo European 

82
00:04:29,781 --> 00:04:30,614
languages spoken in northern India.
Tamil has a long literary history 

83
00:04:33,351 --> 00:04:36,050
reaching back to around 2,600
years ago.

84
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:39,770
The temple script is an aggregator,
meaning a script in which consonants and

85
00:04:39,771 --> 00:04:42,710
vowels are written together as units,
which can't be separated.

86
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:43,603
Come to think of it,
the [inaudible] script that we had a 

87
00:04:44,961 --> 00:04:47,030
glance at earlier is also an avid 
reader.

88
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:48,043
Well,
I hope you had fun guessing today's 

89
00:04:49,011 --> 00:04:49,844
mystery languages.
Be sure to leave your guesses and your 

90
00:04:51,561 --> 00:04:53,660
reasons for your guesses in the comments
down below.

91
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:56,390
And I'm sure that that will start lots 
of interesting discussions.

92
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,700
Be sure to follow lane,
focus on facebook,

93

94
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:02,660
And I'd like to say thank you to all of 
my patrion supporters,

95
00:05:02,661 --> 00:05:03,494

screen for their continuous monthly 

96
00:05:06,321 --> 00:05:09,410
pledges.
Thank you very much and have a nice day.
