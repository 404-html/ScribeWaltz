Hello everyone,
this is Paul and you are watching the 

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:04,503
lane focus channel.
Today I'm going to talk about language 

3
00:00:06,931 --> 00:00:10,920
learning edge number three,
and that edge is meditation,

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,230
so you might be thinking,
what the heck does meditation have to do

5
00:00:19,231 --> 00:00:20,580
with language learning?
Well,

6
00:00:20,581 --> 00:00:23,670
it has a couple of big benefits that can
really affect your results,

7
00:00:23,671 --> 00:00:26,460
so I wanted to share it with you.
It's something that I do all the time,

8
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,790
but I want to make clear that this is 
not religious meditation.

9
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:30,953
If you have your own religion and you're
worried that maybe this is Buddhism or 

10
00:00:33,871 --> 00:00:35,760
some other religion that uses 
meditation.

11
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:37,710
No,
I'm not teaching you that.

12
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:38,603
I'm just talking about how to relax your
body and also your mind so that you can 

13
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:47,060
focus and learn more efficiently.
Alright,

14
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,473
well let me talk about some of the 
benefits that meditation has for your 

15
00:00:52,421 --> 00:00:53,254
language learning.
One of them is that it puts you in an 

16
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:56,163
ideal learning state,
puts you in something called an Alpha 

17
00:00:58,331 --> 00:00:59,164
state,
which means that your brain waves are 

18
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:01,563
moving at a slower speed than they are 
when you normally go throughout your 

19
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:09,120
day.
When you normally go about your day,

20
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,270
you are in a Beta state in your brain,
waves are moving.
