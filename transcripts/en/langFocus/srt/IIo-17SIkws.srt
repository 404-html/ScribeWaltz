Hello everyone.
Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and 

4
00:00:12,221 --> 00:00:13,054
my name is Paul.
A couple of months back I made a video 

5
00:00:15,311 --> 00:00:16,144
about whether English is really a 
dramatic language or not and I made the 

6
00:00:19,241 --> 00:00:20,074
rather controversial statement that in a
sense English is a hybrid language 

7
00:00:23,471 --> 00:00:24,304
because so much of its vocabulary comes 
from the romance languages and from 

8
00:00:27,161 --> 00:00:30,010
other languages.
That statement was controversial because

9
00:00:30,011 --> 00:00:30,844
of the core of English is indeed 
Germanic and it is actually possible to 

10
00:00:34,331 --> 00:00:37,870
speak English with mostly or entirely 
dramatic words.

11
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:40,090
For example,
instead of saying literature,

12
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:40,953
which is a romance word,
you could say book craft or instead of 

13
00:00:44,081 --> 00:00:46,450
saying ancestor,
you could say for Ken,

14
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,080
it's not exactly easy to speak that way 
all the time,

15
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:50,943
but it is possible.
There is actually a movement to create 

16
00:00:53,021 --> 00:00:53,854
and to promote a new form of English 
like this that stripped of all of its 

17
00:00:56,471 --> 00:00:57,304
nondramatic influences so that English 
would basically become the language of 

18
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:01,383
would have been if it had not been 
influenced by romance languages and by 

19
00:01:04,301 --> 00:01:05,170
Greek and others.

20
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:06,063
Some people refer to this strictly 
dramatic form of English as English 

21
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:12,620
because it's supposed to take English 
back to it's Anglo Saxon roots.

22
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,610
English as a form of English linguistic 
purism.

23
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:16,683
English seeks to achieve the Germanic 
purity of English in a few different 

24
00:01:19,841 --> 00:01:20,680
ways.
First,

25
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:21,573
by choosing existing dramatic words 
rather than the romance equivalence to 

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,790
by reviving obsolete Germanic words.
Three,

27
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:32,680
by adopting words from old English or 
other Germanic languages for by creating

28
00:01:32,681 --> 00:01:35,680
new words based on old English or other 
Germanic roots.

29
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,550
So take this simple sentence.
The man forgot his reign shade at home.

30
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:42,220
What do you think?
Rain shade means something that provides

31
00:01:42,221 --> 00:01:45,010
shade from the rain.
If you guessed umbrella.

32
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:45,873
That's right.
Rain shade is a new word created from 

33
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,830
rain and shade,
and it's based on the word sunshade.

34
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:53,800
Umbrella is a lone word from Italian 
umbrella.

35
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:54,813
All of the other words in this sentence,
our regular English words of Germanic 

36
00:01:57,191 --> 00:01:57,820
origin.

37
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:01,060
And you probably noticed that the words 
are not changed into old English.

38
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:04,270
They're all in modern English just 
without the nondramatic elements.

39
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:06,123
Another example,
I unlocked the man since he's very 

40
00:02:07,991 --> 00:02:10,390
isn't.
Now here's the original sentence I wrote

41
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:11,253
in standard English.
I respect the man because he's very 

42
00:02:13,421 --> 00:02:18,421
industrious on look comes from old 
English on lake to observe or regard,

43
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:22,840
but it seems the cents has been extended
to me in regard positively or respect.

44
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,820
Now,
why did I change the word because.

45
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,713
Well,
because the cause part of because is of 

46
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:31,020
romance origin since it's just a 
dramatic alternative to because it's.

47
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:31,973
There's a real English word which is 
still used in some dialects of northern 

48
00:02:34,511 --> 00:02:35,344
England and I believe also in Scotland 
and of course when I speak of that man 

49
00:02:38,381 --> 00:02:39,214
who very and I'm referring to a name 
known show player I've seen on the or a 

50
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,700
name known show player I've seen on the 
Farsi year.

51
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:47,920
Here's the original phrase in standard 
English,

52
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,263
a famous actor I've seen on the 
television name known as a newly a 

53
00:02:52,161 --> 00:02:52,994
shaping word that comes from name and 
known markedly and show player is 

54
00:02:56,861 --> 00:03:01,300
another melding of two extending words 
and Farsi or is a likeness of the German

55
00:03:01,301 --> 00:03:06,070
word found in everyday talk.
We deal with a lot of dramatic words,

56
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:08,890
but for some under warps,
like which ship we deal with,

57
00:03:08,891 --> 00:03:11,760
many more outland words.
In 1989,

58
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:16,120
author Paul Anderson for later well 
known ritz named unclip dish beholding,

59
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:16,983
which means atomic theory in thoroughly 
dramatic English without any outland 

60
00:03:20,411 --> 00:03:22,750
words.
Let's take a look at some of that risk.

61
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:27,280
For most of its being mankind did not 
know what things are made of,

62
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:32,050
but could only guess with the growth of 
world can we began to learn and today we

63
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:36,040
have a beholding of stuff and work that 
watching bears out both in the workstead

64
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:39,790
and in daily life being is used instead 
of existence.

65
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,860
World Ken means physics.
Beholding means theory.

66
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:47,620
Stuff I believe means matter.
Work,

67
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,710
I think means energy and workstead means
workplace,

68
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:53,853
the underlying kinds of stuff,
or the first stuff's which linked 

69
00:03:56,471 --> 00:03:59,110
together in sundry ways to give rise to 
the rest.

70
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:02,830
Formerly we knew of 92 for stuffs from 
water stuff,

71
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:07,890
the lightest embarrassed to email stuff.
The heaviest first stuffs are elements.

72
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:11,620
Sundry means various.
This is a regular English word.

73
00:04:11,621 --> 00:04:14,950
It's just less common than various water
stuff means hydrogen.

74
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:20,130
Barest means simplest and emir stuff 
means uranium in my wind.

75
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:22,840
This seems like English but somewhat 
weird.

76
00:04:22,841 --> 00:04:25,270
English.
English is interesting because by trying

77
00:04:25,271 --> 00:04:26,104
to read it or use it,
we get a sense of just how much we 

78
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:31,570
normally rely on nondramatic vocabulary 
when we speak English.

79
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:32,493
On the other hand,
you learn that it is possible to speak 

80
00:04:34,151 --> 00:04:34,984
English without any nondramatic words.
If you're willing to use some archaic 

81
00:04:37,751 --> 00:04:40,840
vocabulary or new vocabulary based on 
Germanic roots.

82
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:41,853
The grammar is the same,
so it's mainly a matter of consciously 

83
00:04:43,781 --> 00:04:45,610
substituting different vocabulary.

84
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,593
So the question of the day,
what do you think of linguistic purism 

85
00:04:49,091 --> 00:04:49,924
like English.
Do you think there's any reason to 

86
00:04:51,281 --> 00:04:52,114
remove foreign influences from a 
language or do you see those foreign 

87
00:04:54,581 --> 00:04:57,130
influences as just part of the languages
development?
