Hello everyone.
Welcome to the Lange focus channel.

2
00:00:02,561 --> 00:00:03,394
This is just a quick mini video to 
answer a frequently asked question that 

3
00:00:06,191 --> 00:00:09,370
I get on my channel and that is what is 
a Lingua Franca.

4
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:12,190
Lingua Franca is a phrase that I use a 
lot on the channel.

5
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:13,463
A Lingua Franca is a language that is 
used for communication between people 

6
00:00:16,721 --> 00:00:20,460
who speak different native languages.
Here are a couple of examples,

7
00:00:20,461 --> 00:00:23,260
situations of when a Lingua Franca is 
necessary.

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,273
For example,
there are many languages spoken in a 

9
00:00:25,661 --> 00:00:29,410
particular area or amongst different 
ethnic groups and they need the language

10
00:00:29,411 --> 00:00:31,840
to communicate with one another.
Another example,

11
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:35,470
there is trade between two different 
countries that have no common language.

12
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,713
Example,
three at a professional conference for 

13
00:00:39,221 --> 00:00:40,054
experts from different countries who 
have different native languages on a 

14
00:00:42,611 --> 00:00:43,444
global scale.
The current largest Lingua Franca is 

15
00:00:45,461 --> 00:00:46,294
English,
but there are other various Lingua 

16
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:50,380
Franca is on a regional level and on a 
national level.

17
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:53,950
An example of a regional Lingua Franca 
is the French language.

18
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:54,813
In Africa,
there are a lot of different languages 

19
00:00:56,321 --> 00:00:57,154
spoken in Africa and in a large portion 
of the continent they use French as 

20
00:01:00,131 --> 00:01:02,830
their language of communication as their
Lingua Franca.

21
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:04,323
An example of a national Lingua Franca 
is in Pakistan where there are various 

22
00:01:07,991 --> 00:01:08,824
different languages spoken,
but or Redo the national language is 

23
00:01:11,141 --> 00:01:13,780
used as the Lingua Franca between those 
different groups.

24
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:14,823
And other similar situation is in 
Philippines where they have to Lingua 

25
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:20,110
Franca us kind of what they mixed the 
two Lingua Franca.

26
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:24,520
Sometimes they have to gallog and 
English and those are used as the Lingua

27
00:01:24,521 --> 00:01:27,490
Franca between people from different 
regions of the country.

28
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:29,013
Sometimes there are both National Lingua
Franca is and more local Lingua Franca 

29
00:01:32,591 --> 00:01:33,424
is within a country.
So if we take the example of 

30
00:01:35,021 --> 00:01:35,854
Philippines,
there is a region where Ilocano is the 

31
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:39,064
main language.
So someone from the Ilocanos speaking 

32
00:01:41,081 --> 00:01:43,270
region meet someone from,
for example,

33
00:01:43,271 --> 00:01:47,170
the BCO speaking region.
They'll probably use the national Lingua

34
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:48,003
Franca,
which is tagalog or English or use both 

35
00:01:49,811 --> 00:01:50,530
of them.
Uh,

36
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:51,363
but if that same person meets someone 
from the Ilocanos speaking region who 

37
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:57,370
speaks a different language,
like a minority language,

38
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,383
then they'll probably use that local 
language Ilocano as the Lingua Franca 

39
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:05,170
because just in that one region there 
are various languages spoken.

40
00:02:05,171 --> 00:02:08,650
So the Lingua Franca you use depends on 
who you're speaking to.

41
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,710
So you're sort of leveling up.
If you speak to someone in your region,

42
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:15,100
you can't understand them.
Use that regional Lingua Franca.

43
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:19,060
If you speak to someone from a different
region used the national Lingua Franca.

44
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,313
So it sounds all kind of complicated,
but basically it means speak the 

45
00:02:22,781 --> 00:02:25,360
language that helps you communicate with
that person the best.

46
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:28,540
Yeah.

47
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,373
The term Lingua Franca itself comes from
the name of a language that was spoken 

48
00:02:32,591 --> 00:02:35,650
in this way in the Mediterranean region 
for hundreds of years.

49
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:36,723
It was kind of a creole romance language
that had a lot of vocabulary from 

50
00:02:39,881 --> 00:02:42,280
different Mediterranean languages mixed 
into it.

51
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:47,820
One English source from 1632 referred to
this language as bastard Spanish.

52
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,213
So to wrap up and clarify,
a Lingua Franca is a language that is 

53
00:02:54,011 --> 00:02:57,940
used for communication between the 
speakers of different native languages.

54
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:00,490
I hope that clarifies things.
Thank you for watching.

55
00:03:00,491 --> 00:03:01,720
Have a nice day.
