00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:06,200
Hello everyone,
thank you for tuning into the lane focus

2
00:00:06,201 --> 00:00:07,490
channel.
My name is Paul.

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:12,500
Today's topic is the Fsi free courses 
that are available online.

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,633
So what does the Fsi that is the foreign
service institute and that is where 

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:17,713
American diplomats or foreign service 
workers do their intensive language 

6
00:00:20,901 --> 00:00:21,734
training before they are placed abroad.
Now why does that matter to us to 

7
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:28,460
language learners?
Will it's because the Fsi materials,

8
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:29,323
at least the older Fsi and materials 
that they use for their intensive 

9
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:33,373
language study are available in the 
public domain and you can get them on 

10
00:00:35,991 --> 00:00:39,560
the Internet for free.
So that's very relevant to us.

11
00:00:39,561 --> 00:00:42,200
Anything that's free makes us pay a 
close attention,

12
00:00:42,201 --> 00:00:43,400
doesn't it?
Well,

13
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:46,250
you can also get them in hard copy 
format.

14
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,250
You can get some repackaged versions 
like this.

15
00:00:49,251 --> 00:00:50,084
This one is called mastering Hebrew,
but this is actually the Fsi Hebrew 

16
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:53,090
course.

17
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:53,923
Just some,
uh,

18
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:56,930
some entrepreneur repackage them and 
decided to sell it.

19
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,490
I also have this one mastering French 
and I have this one which is called.

20
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:02,663
It's just Saudi Arabic.
This is the Saudi Arabic of course from 

21
00:01:05,241 --> 00:01:06,074
the FSF.
So you can buy them in hard copy format 

22
00:01:08,781 --> 00:01:09,614
if you are willing to spend some money,
if you want the free one or if you want 

23
00:01:11,601 --> 00:01:13,730
to try them,
then they're public domain,

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,833
find them on the Internet and I'll give 
you a link where you can find them 

25
00:01:17,271 --> 00:01:18,104
later.
So let's talk a little bit about the 

26
00:01:19,281 --> 00:01:22,340
pros and cons of these FSI materials.
First of all,

27
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:25,190
the pros,
the first thing is there are free.

28
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:27,290
So how can you go wrong with free 
materials?

29
00:01:27,291 --> 00:01:28,124
Even if they suck,
then you stopped using them and you've 

30
00:01:30,111 --> 00:01:31,040
lost nothing,
right?

31
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:33,020
So you can download them,
try them out,

32
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:33,770
see how it goes.

33
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:35,420
They're free.
What more could you ask for?

34
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:38,180
The second thing is that they are quite 
dense courses.

35
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:39,014
There is quite a lot of material that 
you can use that you can get through 

36
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:45,080
there.
The Hebrew one is about 550 pages.

37
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,153
The French one,
well this is only one quarter of it 

38
00:01:47,571 --> 00:01:51,020
right here on this in this volume,
but this is 250 pages.

39
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:51,913
It's altogether,
it's 900 or a thousand pages and the 

40
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:54,914
Arabic one is 250 pages,
so there's quite a lot of material for 

41
00:01:57,891 --> 00:02:00,860
you to use and there's hours and hours 
of audio to go with it,

42
00:02:00,861 --> 00:02:04,130
so it's just a lot that you can use.
If you do work through that material,

43
00:02:04,131 --> 00:02:04,964
you'll gain a good working knowledge of 
the language that will probably also be 

44
00:02:08,031 --> 00:02:08,864
very good for your sentence level 
fluency because they just drilled the 

45
00:02:11,241 --> 00:02:12,074
hell out of you.
There are so many drills in these 

46
00:02:13,251 --> 00:02:15,320
courses and there are question and 
answer drills,

47
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:17,480
substitution drills,
transformation drills,

48
00:02:17,481 --> 00:02:18,231
just drills,
drills,

49
00:02:18,231 --> 00:02:18,800
drills.

50
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,633
Not all the time but a lot of the time 
and it really helps you just spit out 

51
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:26,930
the sentences more quickly.
It really helps improve your fluency and

52
00:02:26,931 --> 00:02:27,764
to produce sentences on the go when you 
need to so you don't have to spend as 

53
00:02:30,921 --> 00:02:32,960
much thinking time to produce your 
sentences.

54
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,980
After finishing the FSI Hebrew course,
there was a huge jump in my fluency.

55
00:02:36,981 --> 00:02:39,170
I could produce sentences much more 
rapidly.

56
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:43,520
I actually studied with the Fsi course 
between two trips to the Middle East.

57
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:47,240
On the first trip I couldn't really 
produce sentences very quickly and on my

58
00:02:47,241 --> 00:02:49,820
second trip there,
after using the Fsi course,

59
00:02:49,821 --> 00:02:50,900
everybody told me,
wow,

60
00:02:50,901 --> 00:02:51,734
you speak like a native speaker.
I guess they're flattering me a little 

61
00:02:54,201 --> 00:02:55,034
bit,
but basically doing so many drills 

62
00:02:56,421 --> 00:03:00,550
helped me to to speak fluently and 
without lot of pausing and hesitation.

63
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:01,563
They're also good because the language 
presented is based on everyday common 

64
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:05,343
situation.

65
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,510
Things like meeting someone for the 
first time,

66
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,720
ordering a ticket at the station,
inviting someone out,

67
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,600
that kind of thing,
talking about the weather.

68
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:16,120
Those are the way they introduce the 
language at the beginning of the lessons

69
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:19,750
and then after that they expand upon 
that by drilling the hell out of you,

70
00:03:19,751 --> 00:03:20,584
but they introduced the language using 
those common situations so everything 

71
00:03:23,501 --> 00:03:24,334
you learn is quite useful and relevant 
and it's thematically based in each 

72
00:03:27,251 --> 00:03:28,084
chapter,
so that helps you remember all of the 

73
00:03:29,831 --> 00:03:33,100
new material you're learning now for the
cons or the bad.

74
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,593
These courses are mind numbingly boring.
At least some of them and at least at 

75
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,793
times they can be really,
really drill intensive and I remember 

76
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:44,050
sitting there in the middle of these 
courses sometimes just counting down the

77
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:44,501
minutes saying,
okay,

78
00:03:44,501 --> 00:03:45,910
10 more minutes,
10 more minutes,

79
00:03:45,911 --> 00:03:46,744
I'm almost done,
and just praying for the end because 

80
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,350
they really are boring.

81
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:53,980
You need to be motivated yourself.
These courses will not motivate you.

82
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,023
They're really dry a lot of the time and
you just have to push through them and 

83
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:00,460
that requires you to bring your own 
motivation to the table.

84
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,660
Another downside is that the audio 
materials are just not that high quality

85
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:05,494
because they were produced in the 19 
sixties and seventies quite a long time 

86
00:04:07,961 --> 00:04:12,790
ago and the new cds that you might get 
are still based on those original master

87
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:14,440
tapes.
So sometimes they're not clear,

88
00:04:14,441 --> 00:04:16,840
they're a bit fuzzy and they're just not
really.

89
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:18,383
They're not really as good of a model as
a digital audio recording would be a 

90
00:04:21,431 --> 00:04:22,264
modern recording,
so I would recommend that if you do use 

91
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:28,270
these Fsi materials,
you get some other more modern digitally

92
00:04:28,271 --> 00:04:29,104
recorded audio materials so that you can
copy the pronunciation of a native 

93
00:04:32,381 --> 00:04:33,730
speaker clearly.

94
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:34,563
Right.
Another downside is that these courses 

95
00:04:36,581 --> 00:04:39,430
are not really made to be used as 
standalone materials.

96
00:04:39,431 --> 00:04:40,264
They're made to be a manual for a 
classroom course that is taught by an 

97
00:04:43,811 --> 00:04:44,644
instructor and the instructor in these 
courses is supposed to give you extra 

98
00:04:47,981 --> 00:04:48,814
activities that help you get more 
interactive experience and sometimes in 

99
00:04:51,881 --> 00:04:54,610
some of the books you can see notes to 
the instructor like,

100
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:55,503
please do this,
please prepare an activity for this 

101
00:04:57,101 --> 00:04:57,934
purpose and that kind of thing.
But obviously those activities are not 

102
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,833
in the book.
They were up to the instructor of the 

103
00:05:03,071 --> 00:05:03,904
classroom course.
So these books don't come with a 

104
00:05:05,651 --> 00:05:08,410
classroom course.
You have to get that experience,

105
00:05:08,411 --> 00:05:12,220
that extra component that the teacher 
would be responsible for.

106
00:05:12,221 --> 00:05:13,054
You have to get done on your own,
so really you need to just get 

107
00:05:15,341 --> 00:05:18,370
experience communicating and interacting
with native speakers.

108
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,600
You need to take some lessons.

109
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,910
You get to talk with friends who speak 
that language,

110
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,860
just do that in addition to these 
courses,

111
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,753
so in conclusion,
most people find these Fsi courses 

112
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:29,350
really just too boring to drill 
intensive,

113
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:30,243
but I do marginally recommend them for 
people who are just having trouble with 

114
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:36,040
fluency and having trouble with sentence
structure.

115
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,023
People who take a long time to think 
about their sentences and piece them 

116
00:05:39,311 --> 00:05:41,830
together.
If you want to gain that automaticity,

117
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:44,290
that fluency,
then you want to just practice with some

118
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:46,150
drills.
These are really good for drills.

119
00:05:46,151 --> 00:05:46,984
That's basically the main thing I 
recommend them for and if you want to 

120
00:05:49,241 --> 00:05:52,720
just be able to spit out sentences more 
quickly than by all means try these out.

121
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:53,583
Check out their drills,
but bring your own motivation to the 

122
00:05:56,051 --> 00:06:01,051
table because these are boring and also 
just be prepared for some unclear audio.

123
00:06:01,071 --> 00:06:05,960
Don't expect 2015 level audio quality 
for because you won't get it.

124
00:06:05,961 --> 00:06:10,160
So supplement with some other audio that
you can model your pronunciation after.

125
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:12,740
Thank you for tuning into the length 
focus channel.

126
00:06:12,741 --> 00:06:14,330
Have a good night.
Talk to you later.

127
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:18,170
Something that has been all the rage 
recently,

128
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:19,123
something called duo lingo.
Now this is a totally free language 

129
00:06:22,311 --> 00:06:26,000
learning platform.
It has a online desktop version and also

130
00:06:26,001 --> 00:06:29,180
a smartphone version.
It's quite good.

131
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,460
Um,
I like it,

132
00:06:31,461 --> 00:06:32,294
but I think it's quite expensive and 
that seems to be one of the common 

133
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,560
complaints is just the price.
