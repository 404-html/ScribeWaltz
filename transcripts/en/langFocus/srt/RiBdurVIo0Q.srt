00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,640
Hello everyone,
welcome to the lange focus channel.

2
00:00:02,641 --> 00:00:03,620
Uh,
my name is Paul.

3
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:08,130
Today's video is the second installment 
in the series mystery languages.

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:10,860
If you haven't seen the first video in 
the mystery language,

5
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:13,410
a series,
you can check it out right here,

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,633
but basically this is how it works.
I will play you an audio sample of a 

7
00:00:17,311 --> 00:00:21,150
language and then I'll show you a visual
samples of the language and it's written

8
00:00:21,151 --> 00:00:23,880
for them and you can guess what language
it is,

9
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,740
but whether you guessed correctly or 
not,

10
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:26,603
that doesn't matter.
The important thing is that you leave 

11
00:00:28,081 --> 00:00:28,914
your guesses and the reasons for your 
guesses in the comments down below and 

12
00:00:31,411 --> 00:00:33,300
that will spark some interesting 
discussion.

13
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,610
So let's get right into the first 
language.

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,593
Please listen,

15
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,433
I'm bidding in a pile in the middle one 
upon which enabled me to pronounce away 

16
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:47,003
Nomia Sheila.
I'm a building and some peanut volcker 

17
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,290
to Monica,
but the upper market but Lukla bond.

18
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:53,600
Okay.
Lions are going to.

19
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,880
Now let's have a look at a few written 
samples of that same language.

20
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:02,990
Nema,
Nina Harland.

21
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,120
Cool.
But don't they?

22
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,240
So what language do you think it is?

23
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:17,380
The language is a language spoken on the
island of Cebu in the Philippines.

24
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,720
If you guessed together,
log or Filipino,

25
00:01:19,721 --> 00:01:22,360
which is the official language which is 
based on Tagalog,

26
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:26,200
then that's a pretty good guests because
to Gallaghan Silvano are closely related

27
00:01:26,201 --> 00:01:28,060
languages I've studied together.
Again,

28
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:31,420
I'm fairly familiar with it and when I 
look at Sidwell I know sometimes I don't

29
00:01:31,421 --> 00:01:34,030
know if I'm looking at Tagalog with lots
of vocabulary,

30
00:01:34,031 --> 00:01:34,864
I don't know or whether I'm looking at 
say Bono said we wanna was sometimes 

31
00:01:37,451 --> 00:01:38,284
referred to as Bisiah,
which is actually a group of closely 

32
00:01:40,661 --> 00:01:44,170
related languages that are spoken in the
Visayas region in the Philippines,

33
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:45,123
but some people like to refer to all the
languages as a single language with 

34
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:49,803
different dialects and that's because 
all the Bisiah languages are quite 

35
00:01:52,241 --> 00:01:54,160
closely related.
But also because.

36
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,013
Well there's power in numbers.
You may have noticed the Spanish 

37
00:01:57,551 --> 00:01:58,384
vocabulary in the sample sentences.
That's because it has lots of Spanish 

38
00:02:01,541 --> 00:02:02,374
long words just like to Gallo does in 
fact several one or has even more 

39
00:02:04,841 --> 00:02:06,660
Spanish words meant together.
Okay.

40
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:09,250
Onto the second language,
please listen.

41
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:16,940
They get food when he's sad,
her warm up so they can meet,

42
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:21,270
meet and whole manual,
mundane,

43
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,040
poem.
They put handcuffs,

44
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:28,580
put him to hold still

45
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,193
and again.
Let's have a look at some written 

46
00:02:32,101 --> 00:02:32,934
samples.

47
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,160
Yeah,
I guess

48
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,170
so.
What language is it?

49
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:46,943
It's the loud language.
Lao is a language spoken in the 

50
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:49,794
Southeast Asian nation of Laos.
It's a member of the Tai Chi language 

51
00:02:53,311 --> 00:02:54,144
family,
which is spoken in some parts of 

52
00:02:54,901 --> 00:02:57,540
Southeast Asia,
southern China and northern India.

53
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:58,643
If you thought the language was tied 
then you were very close because ty and 

54
00:03:01,571 --> 00:03:02,404
Lao,
or very closely related to a large 

55
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:05,560
degree,
they are mutually intelligible.

56
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,513
They are both tonal languages,
but one notable differences that ty has 

57
00:03:09,191 --> 00:03:11,470
five tones.
While Lau has six tones,

58
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,870
they're also written in a slightly 
different script,

59
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,793
but the scripts themselves are also 
closely related and if you can read one 

60
00:03:17,161 --> 00:03:18,730
than reading the others shouldn't be too
hard.

61
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:19,803
Some of you may have noticed the tones 
and the language samples which make the 

62
00:03:22,121 --> 00:03:22,954
language sound kind of melodic,
and you might have guessed one of the 

63
00:03:24,881 --> 00:03:27,100
Chinese languages like Mandarin or 
Cantonese,

64
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,040
and those guesses would make sense 
because those are tonal languages.

65
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:31,870
Just like lawand tire.
Okay.

66
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,360
Onto the third language,
please listen.

67
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,593
Modify on central park.
Young Scheme will mix as a club Dj Vika 

68
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,670
Outta the shop does issue three,
Dan

69
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:58,383
and again,
let's see a bit of the language 

70
00:03:59,381 --> 00:04:00,214
visually.

71
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:04,490
Schools that Cmo,
oh,

72
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,720
seemed more Zune genito Dr.
departure,

73
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:15,260
so what language is it?
It's the Romanian language.

74
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:16,123
If you speak any romance languages that 
you've probably noticed right away that 

75
00:04:18,651 --> 00:04:21,470
there was a lot of romance vocabulary in
the samples,

76
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,440
what the pronunciation might have seemed
kind of unusual to you.

77
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:28,490
That's because Romanian is a romance 
language with some Slavic influence.

78
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:32,450
That influence affects the pronunciation
and also the vocabulary of the language.

79
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,493
You may have also noticed the little 
glyphs above the letter a and below the 

80
00:04:35,871 --> 00:04:39,740
letter t those glyphs or actually an 
integral part of those letters and those

81
00:04:39,741 --> 00:04:41,300
letters along with this,
this,

82
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:42,163
and this.
Give you a quick hint that you're 

83
00:04:43,131 --> 00:04:46,010
looking at Romanian and not at a 
different romance language.

84
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,053
Romanian is spoken in Romania and 
Moldova and is geographically isolated 

85
00:04:50,451 --> 00:04:51,284
from the other major romance languages.
The Slavic influence on the language 

86
00:04:54,021 --> 00:04:56,300
makes it distinct from the other romance
languages,

87
00:04:56,390 --> 00:05:00,560
but Romanian is also said to be the 
closest romance language to the original

88
00:05:00,561 --> 00:05:01,850
Latin in grammar.

89
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:04,580
That's probably true,
but in some other areas like phonology,

90
00:05:04,581 --> 00:05:07,820
it may not be as close to the original 
Latin as say Italian.

91
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:08,863
Well,
I hope you enjoyed guessing today's 

92
00:05:09,771 --> 00:05:10,604
mystery languages.
Leave your guesses and your reasons in 

93
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:13,124
the comments down below and also letting
me know if you like the series and you 

94
00:05:15,531 --> 00:05:17,660
think I should continue doing it.
And again,

95
00:05:17,661 --> 00:05:18,494
I want to say thank you to all of my 
patrion supporters for your continued 

96
00:05:20,871 --> 00:05:21,704
support,
especially these ones right here on the 

97
00:05:22,941 --> 00:05:25,460
screen for there,
especially generous pledges.

98
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,310
Thank you for watching and have a nice.
