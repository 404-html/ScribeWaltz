Hello everyone,
welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and 

2
00:00:02,911 --> 00:00:03,744
my name is Paul.
Today I want to start this video with a 

3
00:00:06,721 --> 00:00:07,554
new feature called the mystery language.
I'm going to play a language for you 

4
00:00:11,161 --> 00:00:11,994
that you may have not heard before,
and at the end of the video I will let 

5
00:00:14,461 --> 00:00:16,650
you know what this language is.
So check it out

6
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:20,453
a sas,
then the gus and Alisa Fallon trying to 

7
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:32,270
date must watch away.
Mislead it's live.

8
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:40,853
Okay.
Stay tuned until the end of the video 

9
00:00:42,121 --> 00:00:44,370
and I will tell you what language you 
just heard.

10
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,230
Okay.
Onto our main topic.

11
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,810
What country has the most languages 
spoken?

12
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,840
What country is the most linguistically 
diverse?

13
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,793
Many of us come from countries where 
there may just be one or two main 

14
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:58,410
languages and maybe some other regional 
minority languages too,

15
00:00:58,650 --> 00:00:59,483
but there are some countries in the 
world where the amount of linguistic 

16
00:01:01,801 --> 00:01:02,634
variation is just mindblowing.
The country with the most languages 

17
00:01:05,911 --> 00:01:10,911
spoken is Papa New Guinea with at least 
820 different languages spoken.

18
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:15,060
Imagined that upload.
New Guinea is a very rural country where

19
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:15,923
88 percent of the people live in rural 
areas now compare that to 10 percent of 

20
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:20,454
the people in the United Kingdom living 
in rural areas for 19 point three 

21
00:01:23,521 --> 00:01:26,760
percent of the American population 
living in rural areas.

22
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:27,743
Papa New Guinea is very rural indeed and
because of Papa New Guinea is rugged 

23
00:01:31,321 --> 00:01:32,154
terrain and it's deep valleys,
there's a limited amount of 

24
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:37,140
communication between all of those 
isolated rural community.

25
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:38,303
That's why they're remained such an 
amazing amount of linguistic variety 

26
00:01:41,011 --> 00:01:41,844
today without any particular languages 
sort of growing in influence and 

27
00:01:45,031 --> 00:01:45,864
dominating the others.
You imagined that your village speaks 

28
00:01:48,031 --> 00:01:51,270
one language and the neighboring village
just a few kilometers away,

29
00:01:51,271 --> 00:01:55,200
speaks an entirely different language.
That's sometimes the case in top one new

30
00:01:55,201 --> 00:01:57,540
Guinea,
and I'm not even talking about different

31
00:01:57,541 --> 00:02:00,300
dialects of the same language,
although that happens too.

32
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:03,090
I'm talking about completely different 
languages.

33
00:02:03,091 --> 00:02:03,924
In certain cases,
the languages of New Guinea fall into 

34
00:02:06,331 --> 00:02:07,164
three categories.
The first one is the Austronesian 

35
00:02:09,061 --> 00:02:09,894
languages,
which arrived in Papa New Guinea about 

36
00:02:11,641 --> 00:02:13,290
3,500
years ago.

37
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,940
Then there are the top one languages 
which predate the Austronesian languages

38
00:02:17,941 --> 00:02:18,960
in Buffalo,
New Guinea,

39
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:19,973
and then there are the foreign languages
and creole languages that serve as 

40
00:02:22,711 --> 00:02:23,544
Lingua Franca.
The term pop one language simply refers 

41
00:02:26,191 --> 00:02:29,010
to languages that predate the 
Austronesian languages,

42
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,650
languages that are indigenous to pop one
new beginnings.

43
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,440
It does not mean that they are a single 
language family.

44
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:35,363
There are actually several dozen 
different language families amongst the 

45
00:02:37,661 --> 00:02:38,494
pop one languages.
Some of those language families have no 

46
00:02:40,591 --> 00:02:43,650
connection to each other and there are 
some language isolates.

47
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:44,663
That means that there are individual 
languages that have no known connection 

48
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:48,624
to any other languages in the world.
Most pop one languages are spoken by 

49
00:02:51,751 --> 00:02:54,180
only a few hundred to a few thousand 
people.

50
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,180
There are a few that are spoken by over 
100,000

51
00:02:57,181 --> 00:02:58,014
people.
There are three official languages in 

52
00:02:59,051 --> 00:03:01,090
Papua New Guinea.
The first one is English,

53
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,850
the second is talk piece in,
and the third one is he.

54
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:04,684
The to the most widely spoken is top in.
It is an English creole language which 

55
00:03:08,501 --> 00:03:09,334
arose during the colonial period,
top face and is now used as a Lingua 

56
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:13,623
Franca,
which is very important in a country 

57
00:03:14,381 --> 00:03:15,214
with so many different languages and it 
is also now spoken as a native language 

58
00:03:18,671 --> 00:03:22,900
by many people took in is less widely 
spoken in the southern region of couple.

59
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,840
We're a different language,
often functions as the Lingua Franca,

60
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:29,410
and that is key.
The motu two is a simplified creole,

61
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:32,120
have another Austronesian language 
called multi.

62
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:33,183
Its use has been declining in recent 
times in favor of English and talk 

63
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,120
English is only spoken by one to two 
percent of the population,

64
00:03:40,121 --> 00:03:44,800
but it is widely used in business and it
is supposedly the language of education,

65
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:49,120
but if English is the language of 
education and only one to two percent of

66
00:03:49,121 --> 00:03:49,954
the people speak it,
then that sounds like a pretty dodgy 

67
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,530
education system.
To me.

68
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:57,520
The second most linguistically diverse 
country in the world is Indonesia,

69
00:03:57,521 --> 00:04:00,310
which lives right next to Poplin.
In fact,

70
00:04:00,311 --> 00:04:03,280
half of the island of New Guinea lies 
inside Indonesia.

71
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:06,940
About 740 languages are spoken in 
Indonesia,

72
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:07,893
but there was only one official language
and Lingua Franca and that is Bahasa 

73
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,143
Indonesia or Indonesian.
Number three is Nigeria with 516 

74
00:04:16,481 --> 00:04:19,930
languages spoken,
but English is used as a Lingua Franca,

75
00:04:19,931 --> 00:04:21,490
especially in the urban areas.

76
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:25,420
I guess they need English to communicate
with all those thieving oil companies.

77
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,313
Number four is India with 427 languages.
The main Lingua Franca is our Hindi as 

78
00:04:31,481 --> 00:04:32,314
well as English,
which was left behind by the British 

79
00:04:34,271 --> 00:04:38,950
colonizers in exchange for a massively 
huge amounts of India's resources,

80
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,910
and number five is the USA,
which has 311 languages.

81
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,833
Now,
that may sound surprising because we 

82
00:04:45,131 --> 00:04:47,530
think of the USA as an English speaking 
country,

83
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,513
but remember that there are over a 
hundred indigenous languages in the USA 

84
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:55,450
even though many of them have a very 
limited number of speakers these days.

85
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,620
There are also a couple of hundred 
different languages spoken by immigrants

86
00:04:59,621 --> 00:05:00,454
to the USA.
It may be hard to wrap your head around 

87
00:05:02,741 --> 00:05:05,050
that huge degree of linguistic 
diversity,

88
00:05:05,051 --> 00:05:08,530
especially if you are interested in one 
of those countries and you want to learn

89
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,750
a language to communicate with the 
people there,

90
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,210
but luckily those countries all have one
or more Lingua Franca,

91
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:18,460
which can help you communicate with a 
much larger proportion of the population

92
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,890
from various different linguistic 
communities.

93
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:23,500

99
00:05:36,611 --> 00:05:37,444
from Madagascar.
