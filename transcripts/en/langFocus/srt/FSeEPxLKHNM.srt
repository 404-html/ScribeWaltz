Hello everyone,
welcome to Paul and my name is the Lang

00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:07,560
focus channel.
Several months ago I released a video on

3
00:00:07,561 --> 00:00:08,394
the French language and more recently I 
released a video on cockney rhyming 

4
00:00:11,701 --> 00:00:14,550
slang and that got me thinking about 
French slang.

5
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:15,623
Yes.
Despite all the efforts of the French 

6
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:21,990
Academy says to promote proper French or
formal French,

7
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,110
French slang does exist and is commonly 
used.

00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:26,770
One interesting type of.
