Hello everyone.
Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and 

5
00:00:11,141 --> 00:00:14,890
my name is Paul.
Today's topic is Haitian Creole,

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,250
the most widely spoken creole language 
in the world.

7
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,800
Haitian creole is the main language of 
Haiti,

8
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:21,693
mainly in the Western one third of the 
island of Hispaniola with the rest of 

9
00:00:24,971 --> 00:00:27,370
the island belonging to the Dominican 
Republic.

10
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:31,540
It's spoken by somewhere around 12 
million people including the 10.6

11
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:32,374
million people of Haiti and Haitian 
immigrants living in the United States 

12
00:00:35,621 --> 00:00:36,880
and Canada,
France,

13
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:37,863
and various Caribbean countries.
Haitian creole is a young language that 

14
00:00:40,991 --> 00:00:43,510
developed in the 17th and 18th 
centuries.

15
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:44,553
It's a French based creole language,
meaning that the vast majority of its 

16
00:00:47,711 --> 00:00:51,040
vocabulary,
around 90% of it comes from French,

17
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:54,310
but it's grammar is mainly rooted in 
west African languages.

18
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:55,203
It's sentence structure is said to be 
very similar to the phone language of 

19
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:58,813
Benito.
How did this combination of elements 

20
00:01:01,391 --> 00:01:04,810
take place?
Well a French colony and part of what is

21
00:01:04,811 --> 00:01:05,590
now Haiti.

22
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:09,970
The island of Tortuga was founded in 
1660 and a few years later,

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,960
the French west India company took 
control of the colony and France claimed

24
00:01:13,961 --> 00:01:18,580
authority over the western part of 
Hispaniola in 1697 Spain,

25
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:22,600
which had previously controlled the 
entire island seated the western portion

26
00:01:22,601 --> 00:01:23,434
of the island to France in exchange for 
French promises to suppress acts of 

27
00:01:26,771 --> 00:01:29,170
piracy against Spanish ships and 
talents.

28
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,780
The pirates were a lawless community of 
French,

29
00:01:31,781 --> 00:01:34,090
Dutch,
and Englishman called the buccaneers.

30
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:34,983
They attacked Spanish ships and talents 
with the support of rival European 

31
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:38,764
powers.
These people with a real pirates of the 

32
00:01:40,541 --> 00:01:42,350
Caribbean,
but I digress.

33
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:45,380
In the French colony,
settlers founded tobacco,

34
00:01:45,381 --> 00:01:49,310
cotton and cocoa farms and African 
slaves were imported to work them.

35
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:50,323
Almost all of Haiti's present day 
population descended it from such 

36
00:01:52,911 --> 00:01:53,744
slaves.
The French colonialists spoke various 

37
00:01:56,061 --> 00:01:56,894
nonstandard dialects of French.
While the slave spoke various west 

38
00:01:59,871 --> 00:02:00,830
African languages.

39
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,190
It's thought that the gay languages,
a branch of the Nigeria,

40
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:05,024
Congo language family were spoken by a 
large proportion of the slaves with 

41
00:02:08,151 --> 00:02:08,984
slaves very often unable to communicate 
with each other or with their slave 

42
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:13,820
masters.
They tried to learn French,

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,310
but without formal training or 
education,

44
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,830
they developed a French based pigeon 
language.

45
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:23,450
A pigeon language is a simplified form 
of communication that arises when people

46
00:02:23,451 --> 00:02:24,284
with no common language attempt to 
Communicate Pidgin languages have no 

47
00:02:27,321 --> 00:02:28,154
native speakers.
When a pidgin language begins to be 

48
00:02:29,931 --> 00:02:33,110
spoken as a native language by people 
born in that environment,

49
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:33,973
it becomes a creole language.
Whereas pigeons are simplified forms of 

50
00:02:37,431 --> 00:02:39,770
communication and may be limited in 
function.

51
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:40,723
When they become creole languages,
they increase in complexity and can be 

52
00:02:43,491 --> 00:02:44,324
used for all functions of life.
Haitian creole is a fully functional 

53
00:02:47,241 --> 00:02:48,074
language.
If you want to learn more about pigeons 

54
00:02:50,451 --> 00:02:51,284
and creoles and how they develop,
check out my video on the subject right 

55
00:02:53,991 --> 00:02:54,824
here.

56
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,920
There are also other influences on 
Haitian creole,

57
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:58,783
aside from French and African languages.
Contact with other Europeans brought 

58
00:03:02,771 --> 00:03:03,604
some Spanish,
Portuguese and English words into the 

59
00:03:05,381 --> 00:03:06,214
language.
There were also frequent slave revolts 

60
00:03:08,261 --> 00:03:12,400
and slaves escaping into the mountains,
encountered the native title people.

61
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:16,750
This contact introduced some Thai,
no words into Haitian creole.

62
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:21,640
Haiti gained independence from France in
1804 but French remains for the prestige

63
00:03:21,641 --> 00:03:22,474
language for the next 200 years.
The government conducted business and 

64
00:03:25,421 --> 00:03:26,254
French and French was officially the 
only language of education until fairly 

65
00:03:30,401 --> 00:03:31,234
recently.
Haitian creole was considered a 

66
00:03:32,621 --> 00:03:35,560
corrupted form of French language of low
prestige,

67
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,453
the language of the poor,
but that stigma didn't stop patient 

68
00:03:38,711 --> 00:03:40,870
creole from developing as a living 
language.

69
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,913
At the end of the 18 hundreds literature
in Haitian creole was already being 

70
00:03:45,311 --> 00:03:48,400
written even though there was no 
standard way of writing the words.

71
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:52,900
In the 1940s the president of Haiti made
an attempt to standardize Haitian creole

72
00:03:52,901 --> 00:03:55,540
orthography with the kind of phonetic 
spelling system,

73
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:56,403
but this met with a lot of resistance 
because some people support it or 

74
00:03:58,790 --> 00:03:59,410
orthography.

75
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:01,600
That was more based on the way French's 
written.

76
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,453
In 1979 patient creole was finally 
standardized using a compromise between 

77
00:04:07,661 --> 00:04:10,930
those two approaches.
Haitian creole finally became a national

78
00:04:10,931 --> 00:04:11,764
language alongside French.
In 1987 before that school instruction 

79
00:04:15,641 --> 00:04:16,474
had always been in French,
which was basically a foreign language 

80
00:04:18,971 --> 00:04:19,804
for most of the students.
When Haitian creole became a national 

81
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:22,894
language,
it was allowed to be used as a tool of 

82
00:04:24,641 --> 00:04:25,474
education in schools alongside French,
which was still officially at the 

83
00:04:28,451 --> 00:04:29,284
language of instruction.
I guess this change allowed schools to 

84
00:04:31,751 --> 00:04:33,910
switch between French and Haitian 
creole.

85
00:04:33,911 --> 00:04:34,744
Whenever that made instruction easier.
French used to be the language of 

86
00:04:38,681 --> 00:04:39,514
official radio and TV broadcasts,
but in the years since Haitian creole 

87
00:04:42,731 --> 00:04:45,490
became a national language,
both languages are used.

88
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:46,683
The major newspapers are all in French,
but it seems that nobody really reads 

89
00:04:49,841 --> 00:04:51,850
them except people from the upper class.

90
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:53,163
In Haiti,
there seem to be two main linguistic 

91
00:04:54,611 --> 00:04:55,444
communities to bilingual upper classes 
and the masses who mostly speak only 

92
00:04:59,051 --> 00:04:59,884
Haitian creole,
they'll maybe they understand some 

93
00:05:01,241 --> 00:05:02,950
French as well because of their 
schooling.

94
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,350
So what does Haitian creole like as a 
French based creole?

95
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:08,740
It's connection to French is immediately
obvious.

96
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:10,780
When you look at a Haitian creole 
sentence.

97
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:11,643
Most of the words are a French origin,
but they're spelled quite differently 

98
00:05:14,351 --> 00:05:15,184
than they are in French.
The French word of it is our vet in 

99
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:23,551
Haitian creole don't say is Dusey.
Mogi is my ga.

100
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:30,070
A state is ash.
Mitzi is messy.

101
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:32,003
Bull Swab year is Boswami c so you can 
see that Haitian creole use a simpler 

102
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:38,980
largely phonetic spelling of French 
words.

103
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:44,050
You should clarify meaning I work is 
went through Advi.

104
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,513
The subject Pronoun here is interesting 
because the Haitian creole word for eye 

105
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:49,893
comes from the French disjunctive 
pronoun more rather than just the 

106
00:05:53,261 --> 00:05:54,130
subject pronouns.

107
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:55,203
In Haitian creole,
there is no distinction between the 

108
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:00,320
object and disjunctive pronouns.
It's just when,

109
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:02,810
except for a short form we'll see a bit 
later.

110
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:04,603
Here's another example of how French 
words are often used differently in 

111
00:06:07,221 --> 00:06:08,054
Haitian creole.
This means I know how to cook word for 

112
00:06:11,841 --> 00:06:12,674
word.
It's I know make food when comes from 

113
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,550
Wa.
Colin comes from net,

114
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:23,300
comes from fair and mulching comes from 
French.

115
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,150
Mosaic in friendship would be very 
different.

116
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,880
You just say queasy name.
First of all,

117
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:33,050
in French there are two verbs,
meaning to know Clinica and seth.

118
00:06:33,051 --> 00:06:33,884
La Coleman means to know in the sense of
being acquainted with someone or 

119
00:06:37,641 --> 00:06:38,474
something while Steph Safwat is used 
when you know how to do something or 

120
00:06:42,171 --> 00:06:44,780
know something by heart in the French 
sentence,

121
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,140
savoir is used,
but in the Haitian creole sentence,

122
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:51,560
the word column deriving from 
[inaudible] is used.

123
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:57,080
My Ga means to eat in Haitian creole,
but it also means food.

124
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:01,340
Samarin g means to make food or cook in 
French,

125
00:07:01,341 --> 00:07:06,341
you could say shaft in the Nicu,
which means to make food with new Leq,

126
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,950
meaning food mosaic doesn't mean food 
and French.

127
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,083
These kinds of changes in meaning or 
usage of French words are common in 

128
00:07:13,761 --> 00:07:17,360
Haitian creole personal pronouns.
Before we saw the pronouns,

129
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,793
which means I or me,
the other personal pronouns are 

130
00:07:21,171 --> 00:07:22,004
similarly of French origin but are a 
little different from their French 

131
00:07:24,561 --> 00:07:25,720
equivalents.
Ooh,

132
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:27,983
Noo Noo you'll notice that no is used 
for we but also for you in the plural 

133
00:07:35,601 --> 00:07:37,700
form,
which is distinct from French,

134
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:40,820
which uses [inaudible].
Not New yogurt means they,

135
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,340
and this one may not look like a French 
Pronoun,

136
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:45,800
but it comes from the French disjunctive
Pronoun.

137
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,533
All of these pronouns stayed the same 
whether they are used as subject 

138
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:52,760
pronouns or object pronouns.
When their menu,

139
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,850
this means I liked them,
you'll learn memory.

140
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,103
This means they liked me.
There are however short forms of the 

141
00:08:00,351 --> 00:08:02,720
pronouns which are used in certain 
situations,

142
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:04,963
possession to show possession.
You simply place the personal pronoun 

143
00:08:08,451 --> 00:08:12,770
after the now leavell.
This means your book with the first word

144
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:17,210
leave meaning book and Ou is the 
personal pronoun for you in the singular

145
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:22,040
word order the basic word order of 
Haitian creole as Svo.

146
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:27,070
Similar to an English or in French where
Colin Geo machine meaning I drive a car.

147
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,023
Here's the subject,
the verb and the object and yellen is 

148
00:08:32,301 --> 00:08:33,134
the indefinite article.
Adjectives are usually placed after the 

149
00:08:35,811 --> 00:08:40,340
now on machine.
This means I drive a red car,

150
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:41,383
but there is a limited number of 
adjectives that come before the noun 

151
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:45,403
verbs.
Now let's see what happens to this verb 

152
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:49,370
when we change the subject of the 
sentence.

153
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:51,560
[inaudible]

154
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:52,813
nothing happens.
There are no verb conjugations and 

155
00:08:54,831 --> 00:08:57,960
Haitian.
The verb doesn't change based on gender,

156
00:08:57,961 --> 00:09:00,510
person or number.
What about tenses?

157
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,493
Verb tenses are indicated by adding a 
tense marker before the verb is the 

158
00:09:06,661 --> 00:09:08,190
present.
Continuous marker.

159
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:10,560
Tay Is the past.
Marker.

160
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:15,750
Dot is the past.
Continuous marker is the future tense.

161
00:09:15,751 --> 00:09:20,751
Marker is the near or definite future 
marker and uh,

162
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,433
is the conditional marker.
No Eileena magazine know this means we 

163
00:09:26,161 --> 00:09:28,950
go to the store,
not pollyanna magazine.

164
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,173
This means we are going to the store.
And notice here that the personal 

165
00:09:33,061 --> 00:09:36,660
pronoun is the short form.
The short forms of the personal pronouns

166
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:39,270
are generally interchangeable with the 
long forms,

167
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,810
but before op and the short form is 
normally used.

168
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,213
Nuclear Eileena magazine.
This means we're going to the store in 

169
00:09:47,761 --> 00:09:50,100
the sense of a near or definite future 
action.

170
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,653
Medallian magazine.
This means we went to the store and so 

171
00:09:54,931 --> 00:09:55,440
on.

172
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,273
It's really that simple.
You just stick the tense marker before 

173
00:09:58,261 --> 00:09:59,094
the verb definite articles.
Let's take a look at this word for a 

174
00:10:03,001 --> 00:10:03,834
moment.
This is a definite article which always 

175
00:10:05,551 --> 00:10:07,560
comes after the noun.
It modifies.

176
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:09,870
But this is not the only definite 
article.

177
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:10,763
The definite article changes depending 
on the final syllable of the noun that 

178
00:10:14,161 --> 00:10:14,994
proceeds it.
If the noun ends with any of these 

179
00:10:17,011 --> 00:10:21,240
combinations of letters or a nasal vowel
like this one in magazine,

180
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,373
the article is if the noun ends in an 
oral consonant that is proceeded by an 

181
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,610
oral vowel.
The article is not,

182
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,340
for example,
leave la the book.

183
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,360
If the noun ends in an oral consonant 
proceeded by a nasal vowel,

184
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:40,290
the article is like Barranquilla the 
bank.

185
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:44,730
If the noun ends in an oral vowel 
proceeded by an oral consonant,

186
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:47,280
the article is,
for example,

187
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:48,960
a the country.

188
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:53,370
If the noun ends in a nasal consonant,
the article is not,

189
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:58,580
or for example delish the telephone 
questions.

190
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:04,820
Yes or no questions can be formed by 
using rising intonation or you can place

191
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:05,873
escape at the beginning.
We'll violations as skilled highly sean 

192
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,780
shit.
Sk comes from French ESCA.

193
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:18,030
Open ended questions can be made by 
placing a question word at the beginning

194
00:11:18,031 --> 00:11:22,410
before the subject you [inaudible].
This means what are you eating?

195
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,590
Chiesa means what?
The first piece,

196
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:26,573
key means,
which and is combined with a second 

197
00:11:29,071 --> 00:11:29,904
piece.
The Pronoun for this or that other 

198
00:11:32,551 --> 00:11:34,740
question.
Words are also formed with Pete.

199
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,023
Do you go through our visa?
This means where do you live or more 

200
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:40,830
literally,
where are you living?

201
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:41,993
Because up indicates present continuous 
[inaudible] means were and comes from 

202
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:51,450
which plus place humiliate.
This means who are you?

203
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,553
Jeevan means who and the two pieces are 
which plus person a couple of more 

204
00:11:57,731 --> 00:11:58,564
sentences.

205
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,140
Sassy.
She actually,

206
00:12:01,141 --> 00:12:01,974
amway is fascist shim way.
This means that is my brother's dog in 

207
00:12:05,861 --> 00:12:06,694
this as my dog word for word.
It's this or that is dog brother my and 

208
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:17,910
this or that is dog mine.
The word saw means either this or that.

209
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,940
So when this case we have two different 
dogs,

210
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:25,030
the meaning of this or that would depend
on which dog you gesture towards.

211
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:26,043
Say is the Copula verb like to be,
and you can see how possession is shown 

212
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,083
for amway means my brother because I 
comes after brother and then this whole 

213
00:12:35,501 --> 00:12:40,501
phrase comes after the word for dog.
So it's my brother's dog by guy.

214
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,220
Give him one reason.
We see clear,

215
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:48,190
don't we by money.
This means the thing I need is the key.

216
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,930
Please give it to me word for word ets 
thing.

217
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:55,950
That's I need the is key.
The please give me it here.

218
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,740
You can see that the word k creates a 
relative clause.

219
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:00,843
The thing that I need the definite 
article modifies the entire proceeding 

220
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:05,374
phrase thing that I need here.
Bond is one of the only Haitian creole 

221
00:13:09,131 --> 00:13:12,400
verbs that has conjugations,
but there are only two forms,

222
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:13,573
ball and Bob here you can see that the 
indirect object comes right after the 

223
00:13:17,261 --> 00:13:21,730
verb and the direct object leap comes 
after the indirect object.

224
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:23,913
As you can see,
Haitian creole is a very fun and 

225
00:13:25,621 --> 00:13:26,454
interesting language and if you already 
know some French then it will probably 

226
00:13:29,531 --> 00:13:30,364
be quite interesting to examine Haitian 
creole and see how it's similar and 

227
00:13:33,371 --> 00:13:34,204
different to French.
And that brings me to the question of 

228
00:13:36,281 --> 00:13:37,114
the day to Haitian creole speakers.
Does your knowledge of creole help you 

229
00:13:40,271 --> 00:13:42,700
understand French and to French 
speakers?

230
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,570
Does your knowledge of French help you 
understand creole and everyone else?

231
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:50,530

235
00:13:55,991 --> 00:13:58,930
