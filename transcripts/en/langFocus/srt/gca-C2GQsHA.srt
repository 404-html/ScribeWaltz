00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,850
Good day everyone.
Welcome to the Lange focus channel.

2
00:00:02,851 --> 00:00:03,684
My name is Paul.
Today I'm going to be talking about 

3
00:00:05,821 --> 00:00:08,160
something that has been all the rage 
recently,

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,053
something called duo lingo.
Now this is a totally free language 

5
00:00:12,691 --> 00:00:16,560
learning platform.
It has a online desktop version and also

6
00:00:16,561 --> 00:00:17,394
a smart phone version.
It's something that I haven't gotten 

7
00:00:19,081 --> 00:00:19,914
around to trying until just recently 
because I've been so busy with other 

8
00:00:22,441 --> 00:00:24,150
things,
but everyone's talking about it.

9
00:00:24,151 --> 00:00:25,290
People keep asking me,
hey,

10
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:26,124
have you tried to do a lingo?
So I had to get on it and see what I 

11
00:00:28,561 --> 00:00:29,394
thought of it.
So I started duolingo lingo just a few 

12
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:33,420
days ago.
I started with Esperanto.

13
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,130
Why did they choose Esperanto?
Well,

14
00:00:35,131 --> 00:00:39,060
I wanted to start with a language I've 
never studied before just so I could try

15
00:00:39,061 --> 00:00:42,900
out the platform and focus on that.
I'll test out Esperanto and duo lingo at

16
00:00:42,901 --> 00:00:44,250
the same time.
That was my thinking.

17
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:49,490
So my basic impressions of duo lingo is 
that it's a great free resource that you

18
00:00:49,681 --> 00:00:51,840
can use a,
it's excellent,

19
00:00:51,841 --> 00:00:52,920
it's motivating,
it's fun,

20
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:53,843
but it's not the only thing that you 
should use for reasons that I will get 

21
00:00:56,521 --> 00:00:57,630
into in a minute.

22
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,020
So let's just have a look and see how it
works.

23
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:04,883
You can see right here,
this is my profile page that's me over 

24
00:01:07,681 --> 00:01:08,850
here,
Paul Jorgensen.

25
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:14,040
And you can see over here on my language
is Esperanto level six.

26
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:14,903
Let's look back at this page over here.
The basic theme of duo lingo is 

27
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:22,380
gamification.
They want language learning to be like a

28
00:01:22,381 --> 00:01:24,390
game,
something that can motivate you and keep

29
00:01:24,391 --> 00:01:27,210
you studying every day.
Because one of the biggest problems with

30
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:30,420
language learning is that people give up
and there are not consistent.

31
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:33,330
I have a video about consistency.
It's very important.

32
00:01:33,331 --> 00:01:34,164
Consistency is king had.
You really need to study every day if 

33
00:01:37,381 --> 00:01:40,140
you want your skills to keep 
progressively improving.

34
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:41,043
So they're trying to solve that problem 
of lack of consistency by making it a 

35
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,253
game.
So if you look over on the left down 

36
00:01:46,951 --> 00:01:49,500
here,
we have an Esperanto skill tree.

37
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,850
They have that for every language.
Of course it starts off with basics.

38
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,740
So you go in here,
this is one skill.

39
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:56,933
Then you have a few lessons for each 
skill and then you move on to the next 

40
00:02:00,511 --> 00:02:01,291
one,
to the next one,

41
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:03,930
and as you move down,
you're achieving targets.

42
00:02:03,931 --> 00:02:06,450
You're getting something called 
experience points.

43
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:07,523
So over here,
like my goal is set at 20 experience 

44
00:02:09,871 --> 00:02:11,160
points per day.
If I get that,

45
00:02:11,161 --> 00:02:13,560
then I've met my goal today.
I went on a rampage,

46
00:02:13,561 --> 00:02:14,394
I've got 380 because I wanted to just 
get a lot under my belt before talking 

47
00:02:18,181 --> 00:02:21,330
about Duolingo.
But if you meet your target,

48
00:02:21,331 --> 00:02:22,860
it's just like a,
you know,

49
00:02:22,861 --> 00:02:24,240
you're patting yourself on the back 
thing.

50
00:02:24,241 --> 00:02:25,074
Yay,
I got,

51
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:29,460
I met my goal for my experience points 
for today and you get something called a

52
00:02:29,461 --> 00:02:31,980
streak.
So I'm on a two day streak yesterday.

53
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,280
I surpassed my 20 experience points 
today,

54
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:38,940
surpass by a long shot.
So if you keep up that streak,

55
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:41,700
then you start to get some other rewards
as well.

56
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,550
The experience points that you get when 
you are on a streak.

57
00:02:44,551 --> 00:02:45,384
But also when you finish some of these 
skills and when you do some translation 

58
00:02:48,181 --> 00:02:51,060
services or when you do some kind of a 
time to practice,

59
00:02:51,061 --> 00:02:53,850
you get these experience points and 
they're basically just a way,

60
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:58,200
a symbolic way to motivate you.
But there are these other reports called

61
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,093
lean gods I've been got from,
it gets whatever you call them and you 

62
00:03:01,331 --> 00:03:04,000
get these when you finish a new skill 
for the first time.

63
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,180
And also when you've leveled up to a new
level,

64
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:09,790
then you get a certain number of 
[inaudible].

65
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:12,010
So if you level up to level four for 
example,

66
00:03:12,011 --> 00:03:13,870
you'll get four ling got sore.

67
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,760
If you pass level 10 then you'll get 10 
lingo.

68
00:03:16,761 --> 00:03:18,950
It's like that.
And then when you finish a new skill and

69
00:03:18,951 --> 00:03:21,030
you get,
I forget how many exactly,

70
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:23,110
you get to mingle or something and they 
build up.

71
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:27,190
So when you get enough of this lingo I 
these little jewel things,

72
00:03:27,191 --> 00:03:28,024
then you can go to the link.
Got Store and you can buy some neat 

73
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:31,294
stuff with them.
Now these are mostly just for the 

74
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:35,740
purpose of gamification and nothing 
useful.

75
00:03:35,741 --> 00:03:38,230
You can't order like the tee shirt or 
whatever as far as I know,

76
00:03:38,231 --> 00:03:40,840
but you can do stuff like this,
a strict freeze.

77
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:44,200
So if you need to take a day off and you
don't want to end your streak,

78
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:47,230
then you can buy a streak freeze for 
four 10 link dots.

79
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:50,470
Or here's a little gambling,
a fun activity,

80
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,333
double or nothing.
You can bet five lane guts and maybe 

81
00:03:53,621 --> 00:03:54,454
you'll,
you'll get 10 link God's back if you 

82
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:57,490
maintain a seven day streak.

83
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:01,320
So it's just basically wagering on your 
own ability to maintain your streets.

84
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:05,380
So it's just kind of a fun way to make 
use of this lingo lights.

85
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,153
Another couple of things.
You can take a time to practice so you 

86
00:04:09,671 --> 00:04:12,250
can see how well you're doing.
That costs 10 lingo.

87
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:15,130
You can take a quiz,
a progress quiz,

88
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,053
and that costs 25 lingo.
So all these things that you can buy 

89
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:19,743
with those lingo that you earned.
There were also a couple of additional 

90
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:23,163
items available on the smartphone only 
and you can buy some special clothing 

91
00:04:26,411 --> 00:04:27,244
for the duo mascot,
a mascot and duos an hour and you can 

92
00:04:30,881 --> 00:04:31,714
buy some clothing for him.
So when he appears on your screen to 

93
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:38,740
congratulate you on a job well done,
he'll appear in his new updated closing.

94
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:41,180
That's another reward you can buy with 
your lingo.

95
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,720
So again,
it's just a fun thing to motivate you.

96
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:48,400
Having things like experience points and
rewards for your successes,

97
00:04:48,401 --> 00:04:49,234
that's something that will appeal to a 
lot of people who are into role playing 

98
00:04:51,821 --> 00:04:53,560
games or video games,
that kind of thing.

99
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:57,340
And it's really expanding language,
learning into off all new audience.

100
00:04:57,341 --> 00:04:58,174
And I think that that's really great.
Another element of duo lingo that helps 

101
00:05:01,271 --> 00:05:02,104
motivate you in a game like way is that 
you can connect with your friends and 

102
00:05:04,751 --> 00:05:05,584
you can follow each other's progress.
So you can see how much they've done 

103
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:09,124
today,
how many experience points they've 

104
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,980
gotten today.
And if you've got more than you can call

105
00:05:11,981 --> 00:05:12,814
them out on that and you can challenge 
them or you can make bets with each 

106
00:05:14,861 --> 00:05:15,790
other,
that kind of thing.

107
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:19,090
So it's really good just to keep each 
other accountable.

108
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,133
Some people don't need that personally.
I don't really need that kind of 

109
00:05:22,391 --> 00:05:24,220
accountability,
but some people really do.

110
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,720
And for them it's great.
Okay.

111
00:05:25,721 --> 00:05:28,930
So getting into the actual language 
taught and the learning method,

112
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:31,810
I really liked the order of the language
that they introduced.

113
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:32,703
It's a very logical,
and it starts from the beginning and 

114
00:05:34,871 --> 00:05:35,704
progress into the more advanced material
starts with very basic sentence 

115
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:42,400
structures,
like a basic vocabulary,

116
00:05:42,401 --> 00:05:44,530
like uh,
the translation for men.

117
00:05:44,531 --> 00:05:45,364
Okay.
Veto,

118
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:48,250
right.
So that's correct.

119
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:49,520
Yes.
I know what's correct.

120
00:05:49,521 --> 00:05:54,040
So continue me and the STSV.
I am not you.

121
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:56,920
That's what that means.
I am not used to put that in.

122
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:59,750
Check it.
Get lost a CC cleaner.

123
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,420
Don't need you.
Right.

124
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,810
So that's correct.
Let's continue.

125
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,310
LACMA,
marbles,

126
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,163
and that means the boy.
So it's just basic vocabulary and it's 

127
00:06:10,111 --> 00:06:11,730
just basic sentence structures.
Like,

128
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,530
I am you,
I am not you.

129
00:06:13,531 --> 00:06:14,364
I am a boy.
I am a man starts with very simple 

130
00:06:16,081 --> 00:06:18,630
stuff.
Just a equals b sentences.

131
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:19,321
Yes.
Okay,

132
00:06:19,321 --> 00:06:20,550
go back.
Um,

133
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:21,743
and then it progressively gets more of 
advanced start building up some more 

134
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:28,860
basic grammar and some basic vocabulary.
The accusative,

135
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:32,540
plurals possessive,
uh,

136
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,620
animal vocabulary,
country vocabulary.

137
00:06:34,621 --> 00:06:36,990
So it's very basic stuff.
But as you get down here,

138
00:06:36,991 --> 00:06:38,700
then you get more into the advanced 
grammar,

139
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:39,810
more events,
topics,

140
00:06:39,811 --> 00:06:40,890
health,
travel,

141
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,900
education.
So it,

142
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:45,570
it looks quite good.
I haven't gotten through all of it yet,

143
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,090
but I'm a third of the way through or 
something.

144
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,960
And I think the order that they teach 
the language and it's quite good,

145
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,060
the selection of vocabulary is quite 
good.

146
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,490
And the sentence,
it gets you to produce our,

147
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:58,360
well,
not totally natural there.

148
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,370
They're basic and they are the sentences
you should be learning at this level.

149
00:07:02,371 --> 00:07:03,204
I think.
So let's go into another skill that I 

150
00:07:05,611 --> 00:07:07,680
was doing more recently.
We'll just kind of,

151
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:10,200
I'll redo it and walk through it with 
you.

152
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,910
So this one Bonai Pat Toi have us long 
Gyne Tago in.

153
00:07:14,911 --> 00:07:18,150
So that means I know what it means.
Literally.

154
00:07:18,151 --> 00:07:18,984
I don't know what they're trying to say,
but I mean it's good fathers have long 

155
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:23,670
days.
What the heck does that mean?

156
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,250
I'm not quite sure,
but that's what it says.

157
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:30,660
So when you are looking at a sentence 
like this,

158
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:35,220
sometimes you have to translate it and 
sometimes from Esperanto into English,

159
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,083
sometimes English into Esperanto.
Sometimes it just asks you to translate 

160
00:07:39,181 --> 00:07:42,930
a word or um,
just look for vocabulary matching,

161
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:45,990
that kind of thing.
But under each,

162
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:47,003
each point there's a link here.
You can discuss the sentence with your 

163
00:07:49,981 --> 00:07:50,814
peers.
You can look down here and discuss and 

164
00:07:53,101 --> 00:07:55,080
ask questions about the sentence.
Like this one,

165
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,030
people are saying,
what does this mean though?

166
00:07:57,031 --> 00:07:59,550
Cause they don't know what the message 
of that sentence is.

167
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,453
What the community interactions kind of 
neat gives you a chance to discuss 

168
00:08:03,421 --> 00:08:05,940
things and get further clarification if 
you need it.

169
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:07,890
Vito Estos Bella.
Okay.

170
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:10,470
So that means,
oh man is handsome.

171
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:14,160
So that's another very basic sentence.
Of course

172
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,200
oil,
it's the plural form,

173
00:08:19,201 --> 00:08:21,030
right?
Veto a with the J at the end.

174
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,000
If your toy men are handsome.
So it gives you the correction down here

175
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,013
at one thing I don't like is that it 
doesn't give you a chance to enter the 

176
00:08:27,571 --> 00:08:29,520
correct sentence if you get something 
wrong.

177
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,790
There's actually,
you know,

178
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:31,643
psychological reasons behind this that 
you should have a chance to correct the 

179
00:08:34,711 --> 00:08:37,170
mistake.
So for me as a teacher,

180
00:08:37,171 --> 00:08:39,690
when I'm teaching my students,
if they make a mistake,

181
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,870
I always have to give them a chance to 
correct themselves.

182
00:08:42,871 --> 00:08:46,260
I don't want to leave them hanging.
It leaves a kind of open loop where they

183
00:08:46,261 --> 00:08:49,530
feel like they've failed and they 
haven't actually fixed the problem.

184
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,393
So it just,
it creates a kind of lingering 

185
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:53,310
dissatisfaction.
I don't like that.

186
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,393
I would prefer if they change so that 
you could enter the correct sentence 

187
00:08:57,511 --> 00:08:59,640
right here after you have gotten it 
wrong.

188
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,513
That's just a psychological thing and 
educational concept that I think is 

189
00:09:03,271 --> 00:09:05,640
important.
I hope they can fix that in the future.

190
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,680
But anyway,
moving on,

191
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,260
Julep has sona,
it's dust.

192
00:09:10,261 --> 00:09:14,190
Malibu owner is the person in bed.
That's what it means.

193
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:19,400
Is the person bad check it being yes.
So you can see as you get them correct.

194
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:26,190
Then this progress bar starts moving 
towards your goal at the end here.

195
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,293
And when you reach this area,
then that means you're finished the 

196
00:09:29,191 --> 00:09:31,890
skill.
But the exercises are slightly different

197
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,040
on the smartphone application.
It's not always entering them in a box.

198
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:35,874
Sometimes they have a bunch of tabs with
words on them and you can arrange those 

199
00:09:40,801 --> 00:09:42,510
words.
So you're practicing the syntax.

200
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:46,860
Some of the smartphone exercises are a 
little better than the online version.

201
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:50,370
Um,
but both of them are good.

202
00:09:50,371 --> 00:09:52,440
You can do both.
Now,

203
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:56,310
one thing that you might notice is that 
it's all just sentence translation.

204
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:57,323
You're given a sentence and you have to 
translate it or you're given a phrase 

205
00:10:00,301 --> 00:10:01,134
and you have to translate it or you have
to just complete a sentence with a word 

206
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,840
like that.
That duo lingo is great for learning the

207
00:10:06,841 --> 00:10:07,674
basic sentence structure of a language 
and the basic vocabulary of a language 

208
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:11,904
basically for making sentences.
It's similar to something like the 

209
00:10:14,641 --> 00:10:17,700
Michelle Thomas Method,
which I think is useful,

210
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:18,534
but it's kind of limited because you 
just learn how to translate into your 

211
00:10:21,361 --> 00:10:22,194
target language basically.
So it's not really giving you the 

212
00:10:25,081 --> 00:10:25,914
interactive skills,
it's not teaching you the discourse 

213
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:30,870
skills that you need to be able to 
communicate in a real context,

214
00:10:30,871 --> 00:10:31,704
so that's its main weakness,
but it is good for teaching you how to 

215
00:10:34,471 --> 00:10:36,000
make sentences.
Now,

216
00:10:36,001 --> 00:10:36,834
another weakness that I think is 
actually quite critical as that duo 

217
00:10:39,571 --> 00:10:42,870
lingo can't really effectively be used 
offline.

218
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:43,943
I was in Philippines just this week and 
in Philippines they don't have reliable 

219
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:48,354
internet.
With your data connection with your 

220
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:53,370
smartphone or on even on your laptop at 
home,

221
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:56,010
often there's an inconsistent wifi 
connection,

222
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:01,040
so it made it really hard and almost 
almost pointless to use duo lingo when I

223
00:11:01,141 --> 00:11:04,090
was out on the go,
especially with my data on my smartphone

224
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:07,410
because you just walk 10 steps and 
you're out of range or you,

225
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:09,090
you turn a corner and you're out of 
range,

226
00:11:09,091 --> 00:11:10,920
you sit in a coffee shop and you're out 
of range.

227
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:15,330
So I would have to sit there and wait to
know if my answer was correct or I would

228
00:11:15,331 --> 00:11:16,164
know it was correct,
but I would have to wait for the next 

229
00:11:18,061 --> 00:11:18,894
question to load until I got into range 
and just made it basically too much 

230
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:25,620
trouble to even bother.
So I really didn't bother with duo lingo

231
00:11:25,621 --> 00:11:27,510
when I was in Philippines this week.

232
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:30,090
So that's just one thing that I think 
they have to tackle,

233
00:11:30,091 --> 00:11:33,510
especially if they want dual lingo to be
a truly global service.

234
00:11:33,511 --> 00:11:36,390
They're going to have to make it so that
you can do it offline.

235
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,253
Like you can download some of the levels
or you can download a certain number of 

236
00:11:39,751 --> 00:11:41,250
skills,
do them offline,

237
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:45,870
and then you can upload your progress 
once you get in range of Wifi or data.

238
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,090
I think that's really important.
They really need to do that.

239
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,370
I know that some other applications do 
do that,

240
00:11:50,371 --> 00:11:51,204
so I hope duo lingo gets on top of it.
That will be really useful for people 

241
00:11:54,161 --> 00:11:54,994
like me who travel and really useful for
people who are in developing countries 

242
00:11:58,271 --> 00:12:00,640
or places where there's inconsistent 
connection.

243
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,213
But in conclusion,
I think duolingo was an excellent free 

244
00:12:04,301 --> 00:12:06,100
resource,
especially because it's free.

245
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:06,934
I just think that that's really cool 
that you can get the service for free 

246
00:12:09,221 --> 00:12:10,054
and then maybe an exchange volunteer,
you're a translation services just as a 

247
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:14,860
gift back to them.

248
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:16,780
I think that that's a really cool way to
do it.

249
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:20,710
Using crowdsourcing in exchange for some
kind of free service.

250
00:12:20,711 --> 00:12:21,544
I think that's awesome and it just shows
where we are in 2015 it's an awesome 

251
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,013
online economy as far as I'm concerned.
So I think if duo lingo balances the 

252
00:12:29,891 --> 00:12:30,724
skills taught a little better,
if it gives you more opportunity to do 

253
00:12:33,731 --> 00:12:34,564
some kind of simulated interaction,
like some question and answer exercises 

254
00:12:37,481 --> 00:12:38,314
and that kind of thing,
it gives you a little more listening 

255
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:42,070
practice,
then it will become even more useful.

256
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:45,670
So I hope they keep expanding the 
features include some things like that,

257
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:47,680
but even as it stands,
it's great.

258
00:12:47,681 --> 00:12:50,020
It's a fun way to just practice on the 
go.

259
00:12:50,021 --> 00:12:52,300
It's a fun way to dabble in a new 
language a little bit.

260
00:12:52,301 --> 00:12:54,370
If you want to see what it's like,
it's free.

261
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:55,510
It's easy to start.

262
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:57,700
It's fun because of the game of vacation
features.

263
00:12:57,701 --> 00:12:58,534
So I think Duolingo is on the right 
track and they're creating something 

264
00:13:01,871 --> 00:13:03,520
pretty awesome.
So I hope you try it out.

265
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:06,190
Thank you for tuning into length focus.
This is Paul.

266
00:13:06,191 --> 00:13:09,310
Have a good nights.
See Ya all over the world.

267
00:13:09,311 --> 00:13:12,790
There are people who speak closely 
related forms of communication.

268
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,640
Sometimes they are called different 
languages.

269
00:13:15,641 --> 00:13:17,920
Sometimes they are called dialects of 
one language.

270
00:13:17,921 --> 00:13:18,754
So how do we decide which one they are?
Sometimes there's some disagreement 

271
00:13:21,641 --> 00:13:24,480
about which one a particular form of 
communication is.

272
00:13:24,481 --> 00:13:26,620
Is it a dialect or is it a separate 
language?

273
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:27,783
Putting them off into the future after 
you finish achieving this current goal 

274
00:13:31,151 --> 00:13:32,380
right now,
for example,

275
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,900
getting really good at French in the 
future.

276
00:13:34,901 --> 00:13:35,734
Beyond that,
you can see the next goal in front of 

277
00:13:37,511 --> 00:13:38,344
you,
which is to start learning Spanish or 

278
00:13:39,491 --> 00:13:41,810
whatever your language of interest.
Yes.
