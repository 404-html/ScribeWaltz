00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:01,143
Hello everyone.
Welcome to the Lange Focus Channel and 

2
00:00:03,311 --> 00:00:06,580
my name is Paul.
Today we'll be answering the question,

3
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:09,490
how are British English and American 
English different?

4
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:10,503
One of the most commonly asked questions
by learners of English and hopefully 

5
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:14,643
native speakers of English.
We'll learn a thing or two from this 

6
00:00:16,331 --> 00:00:17,164
video as well.
The truth is that both British English 

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,760
and American English have numerous 
varieties,

8
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:24,490
in other words,
various accents and dialects.

9
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:25,413
So for the main part of this video I'll 
try to focus on the most standard non 

10
00:00:28,631 --> 00:00:31,570
regional variety of each one.
Disclaimer,

11
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:33,850
I'm not American,
I'm actually Canadian,

12
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:34,773
but I'm confident that we will someday 
be Americans after the invasion 

13
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,560
standard.
Canadian English is very,

14
00:00:40,561 --> 00:00:41,394
very close to general American English,
so I will say the American English 

15
00:00:44,491 --> 00:00:45,324
samples myself,
unless there's some specific need to 

16
00:00:47,311 --> 00:00:50,220
distinguish between American and 
Canadian pronunciation.

17
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:51,563
There are several ways in which British 
English and American English are 

18
00:00:53,851 --> 00:00:56,160
different vocabulary,
accent,

19
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,590
spelling,
and the grammar vocabulary.

20
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,960
Let me just throw a bunch of examples at
you.

21
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:04,350
In the U s people generally say garbage 
or trash.

22
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,050
While in the UK they generally say 
rubbish.

23
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,770
Both literally and figuratively.
The game was rubbish.

24
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:12,383
Americans go on vacation while Brits go 
on holiday and that's also possible in 

25
00:01:16,501 --> 00:01:17,334
American English.
In the u s people rent apartments while 

26
00:01:20,221 --> 00:01:25,221
in the UK they rent flats in the u s if 
your apartment is that street level,

27
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,530
then you live on the first floor and the
person above you.

28
00:01:28,531 --> 00:01:30,780
It lives on the second floor.
In the UK,

29
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:31,643
you live on the ground floor and the 
person above you lives on the first 

30
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:35,094
floor.
If that person above you is unable or 

31
00:01:37,981 --> 00:01:42,870
just too lazy to take the stairs in the 
u s they'd take the elevator in the UK,

32
00:01:42,871 --> 00:01:46,590
they'd take the lift.
When you're bored at home in the U s you

33
00:01:46,591 --> 00:01:50,220
might turn on the TV while in the UK you
would turn on the telly.

34
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,103
When you step outside of your building 
to go for a walk in the u s you might 

35
00:01:55,141 --> 00:02:00,141
walk on the sidewalk while in the UK you
walk on the pavement and if you're tired

36
00:02:00,511 --> 00:02:03,090
of walking in the u s you might take the
subway.

37
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,290
In the UK,
you take the underground in the U S it's

38
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:10,200
perfectly okay to wear pants when you're
riding the subway.

39
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:13,020
But in the UK you'd better where some 
trousers too,

40
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:13,883
because pants means underpants.
And specifically women's underpants are 

41
00:02:18,091 --> 00:02:20,940
sometimes referred to as knickers in the
UK.

42
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:25,410
So when someone overreacts to something 
in the u s you might say,

43
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,040
don't get your panties in a bunch.
But in the UK you would say,

44
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,780
don't get your knickers in a twist.

45
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,750
Paul,
how dare you be so crude?

46
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:35,450
I can't show this video to my six year 
old students.

47
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,010
Oh,
don't even worry about that.

48
00:02:37,011 --> 00:02:39,110
They'll just watch it on their phones 
during recess.

49
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,780
Going back to the word pants for a 
moment,

50
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,660
it can also be used in British English 
as an adjective,

51
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,350
meaning something is crappy or it sucks.
For example,

52
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:51,110
that's how album his pants in American 
English,

53
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,300
you might say,
that album sucks.

54
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:54,853
Excellent.
So for the U S I'll try to focus on 

55
00:02:57,111 --> 00:02:57,944
general American English and for the,
I'll try to focus on received 

56
00:03:01,121 --> 00:03:01,954
pronunciation.
These are the accents you're likely to 

57
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:08,641
hear on CNN and the BBC respectively are
sounds American English is roddick,

58
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,713
meaning that our sounds are always 
clearly pronounced British English is 

59
00:03:13,901 --> 00:03:18,220
non Roddick meaning that the r sound is 
not pronounced unless it's followed by a

60
00:03:18,221 --> 00:03:20,200
vowel sound.
Listen to the difference.

61
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:23,410
My father's in the car,
my father's in the car.

62
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,590
Let's focus on two words.
Father,

63
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,150
father,
car,

64
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:29,163
car.

65
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,620
Notice that the final r sound is not 
pronounced in British English.

66
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:37,390
Father ends in a simple Schwab vowel 
like father and in car.

67
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,110
The vowel sound is linkedin in place of 
the r sound car.

68
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:42,783
Now the thing about British non Roddick 
accents that I find pretty wild is 

69
00:03:45,701 --> 00:03:46,534
something called the intrusive are.
That means that people sometimes add an 

70
00:03:49,811 --> 00:03:52,360
r sound to a word that doesn't actually 
have one.

71
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,790
If it's followed by a vowel in the next 
word.

72
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,013
For example,
in the sentence I saw a film in British 

73
00:03:58,181 --> 00:04:00,190
English.
It's sometimes sounds like this.

74
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,143
I saw a film,
so you can hear that there's an r sound 

75
00:04:03,191 --> 00:04:04,024
connecting saw,
and I once had a British on the job 

76
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:09,100
trainer and I remember she said,
hello,

77
00:04:09,101 --> 00:04:11,590
my name is Paula and I will be your 
trainer today.

78
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:13,450
I remember thinking polar,
what?

79
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:16,120
You can't say your own name,
but it wasn't just her.

80
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:19,990
That was the intrusive are t sounds in 
British English.

81
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:20,853
And again,
I must emphasize that I'm talking about 

82
00:04:22,511 --> 00:04:25,330
the accent referred to as received.
Pronunciation.

83
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,600
T sounds are pronounced as hard teas,
in other words,

84
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,493
voiceless to sounds in the u s they 
sometimes sound like an alveolar tap 

85
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:35,463
instead of to an Alveolar stop.
This normally occurs in an unstressed 

86
00:04:39,311 --> 00:04:43,870
syllable between two vowel sounds or 
between a vowel and a roddick sound like

87
00:04:43,871 --> 00:04:44,704
an Rsl.
So in the u s people say butter in the 

88
00:04:48,131 --> 00:04:52,060
UK,
they say butter in the u s stop fighting

89
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,190
in the UK.
Stop fighting.

90
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:55,503
You may have also noticed that the ow 
sound in the word stop was a little 

91
00:04:58,091 --> 00:04:59,830
different,
which brings me to,

92
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:01,780
oh,
sounds in the word stop.

93
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:04,660
The American oh sound is an unrounded 
vowel.

94
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:08,140
Ah,
while the British oh sound is rounded or

95
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,820
another example,
hot,

96
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,083
hot.

97
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,840
There's also the o Diphthong in the 
word?

98
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,550
No,
in the UK,

99
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:18,790
no,
in the UK the sound is a Schwab followed

100
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:23,791
by an as input show show a sounds in 
other words,

101
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:29,620
sounds represented by the letter a are 
in UK.

102
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:33,550
English normally becomes an ass out in 
American English for example,

103
00:05:33,551 --> 00:05:38,551
in the UK Hoff and in the u s half words
without in British English remain pretty

104
00:05:40,721 --> 00:05:45,721
similar in American English in the UK 
cat end to the u s cat.

105
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:51,340
An exception is a small set of words in 
which the AE is followed by a double are

106
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:56,080
in which case the vowel is pronounced as
air in the u s in the UK,

107
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,063
Mary in the U s Mary.
Because of the difference in the u s 

108
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:01,933
Mary and Mary sound the same.
Carrie and Carrie sound the same 

109
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:07,663
spelling.
American and British spellings are 

110
00:06:09,441 --> 00:06:12,200
largely the same,
but there are a few notable differences.

111
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,810
This is in large part because Noah 
Webster,

112
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,000
whom the webster dictionary is named 
after,

113
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:17,863
made an effort to reform English 
spelling in the 17 hundreds in order to 

114
00:06:20,901 --> 00:06:22,790
make the word spelled the way they 
sounded.

115
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,833
This resulted in some spelling changes 
in American English most but not all 

116
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:32,210
words that ended Ari in the UK and in Er
in the u s for example,

117
00:06:32,211 --> 00:06:35,000
center theater,
meter somber.

118
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:36,883
Some words that end in nce in the UK are
spelled with an se in the u s license 

119
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:47,170
defense offense.
Some words with ou in the UK are spelled

120
00:06:47,421 --> 00:06:50,540
with oh in the u s color,
favor,

121
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,160
honor,
labor,

122
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,203
et cetera.
The ending I s e became izze in the u s 

123
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:00,020
organize,
apologize.

124
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:04,760
A similar change also occurs in other 
contexts where the s is voiced.

125
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:08,810
In other words,
it makes a sound analyze cozy.

126
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,400
There are verbs ending with El that take
a double l in British English.

127
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:15,980
When a suffix is added in American 
English,

128
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:19,160
there's no double l traveled,
canceled,

129
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,053
marvelous.
If you're wondering how the last one 

130
00:07:21,801 --> 00:07:22,634
fits in with the others.
Remember that marvel is a verb and then 

131
00:07:25,341 --> 00:07:28,880
an adjectival suffix is added to it.
Grammar.

132
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,013
There were only very minor grammatical 
differences between British English and 

133
00:07:32,811 --> 00:07:33,644
American English auxiliary verbs.
British people use Shell for the future 

134
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:40,940
much more than Americans as well as to 
ask for advice or an opinion.

135
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:45,710
Some difference in preposition use in 
the u s people say on the weekend,

136
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:46,783
but in the UK they say after the weekend
and then the u s people say different 

137
00:07:50,421 --> 00:07:53,900
from or different them,
but in the UK they say different from or

138
00:07:53,901 --> 00:07:54,734
difference too.
There are some different past tense 

139
00:07:58,251 --> 00:07:59,540
forms.
For example,

140
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:00,403
in American English,
the past tense of the word learn is 

141
00:08:02,391 --> 00:08:03,224
learned.
While in British English it's more 

142
00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:05,840
common to say learnt.

143
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,360
Actually both forms are used in either 
country,

144
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:10,940
but there is more of a tendency towards 
one form.

145
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,013
This is true for other words like 
dreamed versus drempt burned versus 

146
00:08:15,321 --> 00:08:17,990
burnt leaned versus linked,
et cetera.

147
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:23,000
Another example in the u s the past 
tense of dive is usually dove.

148
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:24,800
In the UK,
it's dived.

149
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:29,210
Maybe the American form developed by 
analogy with drive and drove.

150
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,253
Anyways,
differences like these are not 

151
00:08:31,281 --> 00:08:33,420
consistent,
but you'll notice some different paths,

152
00:08:33,421 --> 00:08:34,254
tense forms here in their past 
participles sometimes past participles 

153
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,133
half a different form.
The most well known example is for the 

154
00:08:41,151 --> 00:08:41,984
verb get in the u s there's get got 
gotten but in the UK it's get got got 

155
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,680
both forms got and gotten have existed 
since the middle English period,

156
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,380
but Godson has fallen out of use in the 
UK.

157
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:55,853
Got It.
Can Be used in American English in the 

158
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:02,871
form have got but with the meaning of 
have not have received or have become.

159
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,210
I haven't gotten the eviction notice 
yet.

160
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:09,510
I haven't got the eviction notice yet.
All right,

161
00:09:09,511 --> 00:09:14,511
let's check a couple more sentences and 
see what we encounter in the u s I think

162
00:09:14,581 --> 00:09:18,630
we need a lawyer in the UK.
I reckon we needed a solicitor.

163
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,420
You'll notice that a couple of words 
here are different.

164
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,640
British people often use the word 
[inaudible],

165
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:26,970
which means think or suppose Americans 
know this word,

166
00:09:26,971 --> 00:09:27,804
but rarely use it,
and while Americans would typically 

167
00:09:29,731 --> 00:09:33,630
refer to a professional legal consultant
as a lawyer in the UK,

168
00:09:33,631 --> 00:09:34,464
they often say solicitor,
which is a type of lawyer that does 

169
00:09:36,691 --> 00:09:39,480
consultation.
The type of lawyer who represents you in

170
00:09:39,481 --> 00:09:40,314
court in the UK is usually a barrister.
While in the U s they're usually 

171
00:09:43,501 --> 00:09:44,334
referred to as attorneys.
Another sentence in the U s I'm going 

172
00:09:48,751 --> 00:09:53,040
for a beer with my friends in the UK.
I'm going for a pint with my mates.

173
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:57,510
Notice that British people often say 
pint where Americans would say beer.

174
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,240
Brits also say beer as a countable.
Now unlike this,

175
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:04,110
but pint is frequently used and notice 
that Britt's often say mate,

176
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,910
where Americans would say,
friend,

177
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:07,693
the differences between British English 
and American English might seem 

178
00:10:10,251 --> 00:10:11,084
surprising or a music,
but remember in this video I'm zooming 

179
00:10:13,701 --> 00:10:15,740
in on the differences and focusing on 
them.

180
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:17,660
For the most part,
they're actually the same.

181
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,890
There are some minor differences in 
vocabulary and pronunciation and grammar

182
00:10:21,891 --> 00:10:24,620
and spelling,
but any native speaker with a little bit

183
00:10:24,621 --> 00:10:25,454
of exposure to the other look quickly 
adapt to these differences and be able 

184
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:30,710
to understand the other variety without 
any problem.

185
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:31,843
The differences are sometimes greater if
we focus on regional dialects and socio 

186
00:10:35,151 --> 00:10:37,430
elects of British English and American 
English.

187
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,473
While most Americans probably have no 
trouble understanding received 

188
00:10:41,031 --> 00:10:43,670
pronunciation,
they may have some trouble understanding

189
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:48,290
cockney English or the Jordy accent of 
northeastern England or other varieties.

190
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,050
But as far as standard non regional 
speech goes,

191
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:53,000
I'd say that the differences are 
minimal.

192
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:53,983
However,
learners of English who focus on one of 

193
00:10:55,611 --> 00:10:56,444
the two varieties will likely have a 
little bit of trouble understanding the 

194
00:10:58,941 --> 00:11:01,520
other until they gained significant 
exposure to it.

195
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:02,683
The question of the day,
what other differences between American 

196
00:11:04,851 --> 00:11:07,250
and British English are you aware of in 
this video?

197
00:11:07,251 --> 00:11:10,100
I was only able to give a limited number
of examples,

198
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:12,920
so add yours in the comments.
Be sure to follow Lang,

199
00:11:12,921 --> 00:11:14,540
focus on facebook,
twitter,

200
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:16,220
and instagram.
And once again,

201
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,083
thank you to all of my wonderful patrion
supporters and these ones right here on 

202
