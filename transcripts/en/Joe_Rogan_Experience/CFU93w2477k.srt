1
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,520
Millennials,
when you grow up in a world of

2
00:00:07,521 --> 00:00:09,170
abundance,
you're basic needs are met,

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:14,060
so like that's just an expectation.
Of course I'm going to get a salary and

4
00:00:14,061 --> 00:00:17,660
of course I'm going to get benefits.
What I want is a job that has meaning to

5
00:00:17,661 --> 00:00:22,661
me that connects to my life purpose and
you can only have that if you have a

6
00:00:23,571 --> 00:00:26,600
really strong culture that says,
here's who we are as an organization.

7
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:28,580
Here's what,
here's what matters,

8
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:30,860
here's why it matters to us to be this
way.

9
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:34,110
Organizations that are clear on that are
going to be more appealing to

10
00:00:34,111 --> 00:00:36,230
millennials than the organizations that
simply say,

11
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,393
we do xY,
,

12
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:40,250
z work and we have this opening position
and you should,

13
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,530
you should work for us.
And and that's it.

14
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:45,320
The organizations we saw,
they're doing this or designing their

15
00:00:45,321 --> 00:00:47,270
organizations around the needs of the
employees,

16
00:00:47,271 --> 00:00:51,530
not the needs of management and they're
making it work,

17
00:00:51,531 --> 00:00:55,640
experience customizable and they're
building in continuous innovation and

18
00:00:55,641 --> 00:00:57,980
improvement into management,
which is new,

19
00:00:57,981 --> 00:00:58,250
right?

20
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:02,180
We used to sort of come up with our best
practice and as soon as we have that,

21
00:01:02,181 --> 00:01:04,150
we did that for the next 20 years.
Uh,

22
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,590
that doesn't work anymore.
We have to be more fluid.

23
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:12,010
The traditional organization a relies
heavily on hierarchy and heavily on a

24
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,230
paying your dues,
right?

25
00:01:18,231 --> 00:01:22,100
So in order to advance in the company,
the standard rule is you have to come

26
00:01:22,101 --> 00:01:22,881
there,
you have to work,

27
00:01:22,881 --> 00:01:25,640
you have to do,
you have to do work you don't like for a

28
00:01:25,641 --> 00:01:28,640
certain period of time so that you can
graduate to a different level where you

29
00:01:28,641 --> 00:01:32,210
get to do work that's a little bit
better and then work some more and then

30
00:01:32,211 --> 00:01:35,570
eventually start managing people and
eventually started having authority to

31
00:01:35,571 --> 00:01:40,400
make decisions or do things on your own.
That organization just doesn't make

32
00:01:40,401 --> 00:01:42,200
sense to millennials.
I mean,

33
00:01:42,201 --> 00:01:46,070
we interviewed millennials for this book
and the general theme from our response

34
00:01:46,071 --> 00:01:48,950
from the millennials was,
why are you guys running it like this?

35
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,500
Like they're literally scratching their
heads saying,

36
00:01:51,501 --> 00:01:53,630
why would you,
why would you run an organization like

37
00:01:53,631 --> 00:01:56,420
this?
Why would you not empower people who are

38
00:01:56,421 --> 00:01:58,190
closest to the customer,
for instance,

39
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,320
to make a decision?
Why would you,

40
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:04,900
why would you not share information like
that's a huge women organizations and

41
00:02:04,901 --> 00:02:09,140
millennials don't get to some extent,
the earlier generations are going to

42
00:02:09,141 --> 00:02:11,780
have to learn to give up control.
Uh,

43
00:02:11,781 --> 00:02:13,970
that's a,
that's a big theme I'm seeing in

44
00:02:13,971 --> 00:02:15,240
organizations that,
that,

45
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:18,260
you know,
most of our management systems are based

46
00:02:18,261 --> 00:02:22,730
on control being a good thing.
And I'm finding organizations that give

47
00:02:22,731 --> 00:02:24,650
up on that actually you get to achieve
more.

48
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,090
And so I think the smart organizations
are going to get clear looking at their

49
00:02:29,091 --> 00:02:31,850
millennial workforce,
much of much of whom are going to be

50
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:35,240
entry level to say,
I know you're entry level,

51
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:37,730
but in this area I'm going to let you
run with it.

52
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:41,090
Like within these walls,
you can do whatever you want,

53
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,070
you can experiment,
you can be in charge.

54
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,530
Uh,
and so you've just got to be clear about

55
00:02:45,531 --> 00:02:49,190
where those walls are so that they don't
have huge impacts on the rest of the

56
00:02:49,191 --> 00:02:50,720
enterprise.
Uh,

57
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:54,140
but find places early on to do that.
So they have the experience of making

58
00:02:54,141 --> 00:02:57,080
their own decisions.
I also think in general,

59
00:02:57,081 --> 00:02:59,870
organizations will be pleasantly
surprised when they start letting their

60
00:02:59,871 --> 00:03:03,110
employees experiment because I think
they'll start seeing results that they

61
00:03:03,111 --> 00:03:04,460
wouldn't have predicted that they
wouldn't get.
