1
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.820
<v Speaker 1>Mother was very young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was mentally ill and it was a period</v>

2
00:00:11.821 --> 00:00:16.821
<v Speaker 1>of time when 30 years ago when people</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't know the difference between she</v>

3
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.020
<v Speaker 1>it paranoid schizophrenia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>manic depression,</v>

4
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.890
<v Speaker 1>they didn't know how to treat it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so she was kind of self medicating with</v>

5
00:00:25.891 --> 00:00:29.460
<v Speaker 1>alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This bond that's supposed to happen</v>

6
00:00:29.461 --> 00:00:31.830
<v Speaker 1>because it keeps going back to</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships and bonding.</v>

7
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.780
<v Speaker 1>She wasn't really able to show up as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>mother and as I understand it,</v>

8
00:00:36.781 --> 00:00:41.781
<v Speaker 1>your neurochemistry doesn't develop a</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain way as an infant and you need</v>

9
00:00:43.591 --> 00:00:48.480
<v Speaker 1>kind of jolts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're kind of being prepared to be a</v>

10
00:00:48.481 --> 00:00:50.640
<v Speaker 1>love addict in that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she was also,</v>

11
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.460
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the original love junkie.</v>

12
00:00:53.461 --> 00:00:56.640
<v Speaker 1>If you've looked at the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's that line.</v>

13
00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.700
<v Speaker 1>My mother cried over all the men in her</v>
<v Speaker 1>life and so clearly there was a</v>

14
00:01:02.131 --> 00:01:04.770
<v Speaker 1>depressive thing which has an effect on</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids.</v>

15
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.600
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>laying the groundwork.</v>

16
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.980
<v Speaker 1>She wasn't really available,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'd be reading fairytales,</v>

17
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.630
<v Speaker 1>which no doubt fed into romantic ideas</v>
<v Speaker 1>of love,</v>

18
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.380
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yearning because you're yearning to have</v>

19
00:01:16.381 --> 00:01:20.010
<v Speaker 1>the original attachment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then layer on top of that,</v>

20
00:01:20.011 --> 00:01:21.090
<v Speaker 1>the father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

21
00:01:21.091 --> 00:01:23.400
<v Speaker 1>they were both young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not about blaming them and in fact,</v>

22
00:01:23.401 --> 00:01:28.401
<v Speaker 1>that's been a big part of breaking out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of this cycle is it's not anyone's</v>

23
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.670
<v Speaker 1>responsibility except your own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're an adult at this point.</v>

24
00:01:32.671 --> 00:01:33.960
<v Speaker 1>Let's go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's enough.</v>

25
00:01:33.961 --> 00:01:35.220
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to get the parental</v>
<v Speaker 1>love.</v>

26
00:01:35.221 --> 00:01:37.500
<v Speaker 1>That would've been ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We already had a mentally ill mother,</v>

27
00:01:37.501 --> 00:01:41.910
<v Speaker 1>which has its own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a drama in the house.</v>

28
00:01:41.911 --> 00:01:44.630
<v Speaker 1>And there was always chaos and drama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

29
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.770
<v Speaker 1>her choices kept getting worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And men,</v>

30
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.670
<v Speaker 1>her next choice for her husband was</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who was very violent,</v>

31
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.450
<v Speaker 1>who had named himself to get out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to Vietnam.</v>

32
00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.990
<v Speaker 1>He was a alcoholic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very abusive controlling.</v>

33
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.900
<v Speaker 1>So he ran out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm glad my mother had enough</v>

34
00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.860
<v Speaker 1>presence of mind to take me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we were off to New York and left</v>

35
00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:10.050
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she was seven months pregnant at the</v>

36
00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.950
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very.</v>

37
00:02:10.951 --> 00:02:13.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So interestingly,</v>

38
00:02:13.891 --> 00:02:16.350
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that aspect of the Dickensian,</v>

39
00:02:16.351 --> 00:02:21.351
<v Speaker 1>just these overblown incidents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I didn't really think of that way</v>

40
00:02:21.691 --> 00:02:25.200
<v Speaker 1>when I was growing up because you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the confusing thing too.</v>

41
00:02:25.201 --> 00:02:28.930
<v Speaker 1>You get so into your survivor mode and</v>
<v Speaker 1>gallows humor.</v>

42
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.690
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the truth is now when I look back</v>

43
00:02:33.691 --> 00:02:36.390
<v Speaker 1>and this memoir was a hugely informative</v>
<v Speaker 1>for this,</v>

44
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.080
<v Speaker 1>I realized that that was one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>spots like there what ad words worth</v>

45
00:02:41.081 --> 00:02:45.540
<v Speaker 1>call it spots in time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of flashpoints where I</v>

46
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.750
<v Speaker 1>experienced a fusion of fear and</v>
<v Speaker 1>pleasure.</v>

47
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:54.710
<v Speaker 1>And that I think that violent experience</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the abuse there really had something</v>

48
00:02:56.371 --> 00:03:01.371
<v Speaker 1>to do with informing some of my choices</v>
<v Speaker 1>with ex cons and various other unsavory</v>

49
00:03:01.961 --> 00:03:04.420
<v Speaker 1>but exciting seeming smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>charming,</v>

50
00:03:04.421 --> 00:03:06.310
<v Speaker 1>but dangerous men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Later on.</v>
